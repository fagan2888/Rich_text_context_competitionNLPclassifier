Introduction
The prevalence of substance dependence and abuse among
American youth and emerging adults is startling. The 2012
National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that close to
one in five (18.9%) of 18- to 25-year-olds met the criteria for
substance abuse or dependence in the past year; 6.1% of 12-
to 17-year-olds met this criteria (SubstanceAbuse and Mental
Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2013). Rates of
seeking and receiving treatment are still lower than desirable
(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2013),
but more than 1.1 million 12- to 25-year-olds received sub-
stance abuse treatment in 2012, roughly half of treatment
occurring within specialty facilities (SAMHSA, 2013).
Within this group, a significant proportion will receive treat-
ment and enter active recovery before or during postsecond-
ary education.As a result, though exact numbers are unknown,
a significant number of students are navigating their college
years in recovery from alcohol or drug addiction (Terrion,
2012).
Students in recovery arrive on college campuses that are
often "flooded with alcohol and drugs" and peers who use
them, significant risk factors for relapse (Finch & Karakos,
2014; Russell, Cleveland, & Wiebe, 2010). A 2005 study
found that 68% of college students reported alcohol use in
the last month, and 37% reported using illicit drugs in the
past year (National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse [CASA], 2007). In response to this challenge,
Collegiate Recovery Programs (CRPs) have evolved to pro-
vide campus-based support services to college students in
recovery. The first CRP was established at Brown University
in 1977, and more than 100 higher education institutions and
recovery high schools now offer some level of recovery sup-
port (Finch & Karakos, 2014). Roughly, two to five new CRP
programs emerge each year (Laudet & Humphreys, 2013).
CRPs currently vary in the services they offer, but a compre-
hensive CRP incorporates a range of educational, peer, com-
munity, and family supports, utilizing a systems-based model
for recovery (Harris, Baker, Kimball, & Shumway, 2008).
Example resources include 12-step support groups, counsel-
ing services, academic advising, service opportunities, and
informational seminars (Harper, 2013).

Experiences of Students in Recovery
on a Rural College Campus: Social
Identity and Stigma
Alison Scott1, Ashton Anderson2, Kristen Harper3,
and Moya L. Alfonso4
Abstract
A growing number of college (postsecondary) students are in recovery from addiction to drugs or alcohol. In this article, we
discuss the experiences of students returning to a university campus after long-term addiction treatment. We also explore
the role of a Collegiate Recovery Program (CRP) in providing support, and in helping the students develop post-addiction
identities that will sustain them. To do so, we draw on Goffman's ideas related to stigma, as well as conceptualizations of
identity reconstruction as a practiced, lived experience. Students interviewed faced a double bind; they sought to escape the
stigmatized identity of "addict," but could not identify as typical students because of their abstinence from alcohol and drugs.
The CRP helped them manage the transition to student life, provided a safe haven on campus, and provided an alternate and
positive identity: a student in recovery.

As CRPs spread, there is a growing need for research to
establish best practices for campus-based recovery services
(Smock, Baker, Harris, & D'Sauza, 2011). The growing
quantitative and qualitative evidence base is shedding light
on the potential that CRPs have to prevent relapse and pro-
mote academic success (Cleveland, Harris, Baker, Herbert,
& Dean, 2007), but inquiry related to CRPs is still in early
stages (Finch & Karakos, 2014) and limited both in scope
and context. In addition, there has been a call for additional
research into the experience of addiction recovery among
students on college campuses (Laudet & Humphreys, 2013).
A range of articles have explored dimensions of the sup-
port provided by CRPs, especially at the Center for the Study
ofAddiction and Recovery (CSAR) at Texas Tech University.
A review by Smock et al. (2011) described social support as
a key factor in preventing relapse among college students,
and a number of studies have been conducted teasing out the
importance of different dimensions of social support. Bell
et al. (2009) conducted a qualitative study of CSAR students
and found that the range of social supports provided by the
CRP was seen as integral to students staying in recovery and
in school. Casiraghi (2012) found a relationship between
aggregate social support components and perceived quality
of recovery among students at four CRPs.
Little attention has been given to issues of social identity
and stigma among students in recovery, however. Both are
important considerations in recovery from addiction. The
identity reconstruction that occurs as a part of recovery has
been framed differently by different authors. Some focus on
the emergence and evolution of new personal narratives
(Finch, 2008; McIntosh & McKeganey, 2000; Taieb,
Revah-Levy, Moro, & Baubet, 2008). From this vantage
point, one's ability to change depends on developing new
stories about one's orientation toward life and the world.
This perspective is limited by the profoundly social nature
of addiction and recovery (T. L. Anderson, 1994; Hughes,
2007). Other studies of identity reconstruction emphasize
that it is a social practice, not simply a thought process.
Addictions and recoveries are lived out on a daily basis,
and through networks of people and places. Moving beyond
the addicted self involves leaving behind people, places,
and routines and substituting recovery-based ones as an
embodied reinvention of self (Hughes, 2007). Those who
develop more sober social supports are more likely to
remain sober themselves (K. G. Anderson, Ramo, Schulte,
Cummins, & Brown, 2007).
Unfortunately, stigma may also be a part of this experi-
ence, because although substance use and abuse may be nor-
mative in many settings, to be labeled an addict is often
stigmatized (Ahern, Stuber, & Galea, 2007; Dean & Poremba,
1983; Luoma et al., 2007). Those in recovery may fear being
exposed, or "discredited," to use Erving Goffman's (1963)
term, by the revelation that they are not "normal" (p. 4).
Even if they are not exposed, their ego identity, or felt sense
of identity, may exact this punishment on themselves (T. L.
Anderson, 1994). This is another reason that it is critical to
develop a renewed sense of identity in recovery.
Despite the focus on identity reconstruction in the addic-
tion literature, there is little exploration of the topic as it
relates to college students in recovery, or the role of CRPs.
Terrion (2012) touched briefly on this issue in interviews
with students in recovery at Canadian universities. She found
that being in school helped give the students a renewed, posi-
tive sense of identity, and a heightened sense of their own
potential (Terrion, 2012). However, there were no CRPs at
the universities involved, and the study did not delve deeply
into stigma or issues of social identity. This article explores
the social experiences of students in recovery on a rural col-
lege campus, especially as they relate to identity reconstruc-
tion and experiences of social stigma. It also examines the
role of a CRP on campus in helping students to cope with
these challenges.
Method
This qualitative in-depth interview study was conducted in
cooperation with a CRP at a public university with approxi-
mately 20,000 students. The CRP is housed in an accredited
School of Public Health and is available to students who
have been in recovery from drug or alcohol addiction for at
least 6 months. The average time in recovery of a CRP stu-
dent is 2½ years. CRP students are 24 years of age, on aver-
age, older than the average age of the general student
population. CRP students take 12 credits of course work,
and also work 18 hours a week on- or off-campus. As part
of the CRP, students participate in weekly seminars focused
on coping skills, receive academic advising, and have
access to a range of community-building events (Eisenhart,
2016). The university is located in a rural setting in the
southeastern United States. The institutional review board
at the university reviewed the study, and all participants
provided written informed consent. Researchers conducted
in-depth interviews with 17 CRP-participating students.
Interviewees were purposefully sampled to select students
who varied by gender, age, and academic class to incorpo-
rate a range of perspectives. The CRP Director served as a
key informant who assisted in identifying potential partici-
pants and approaching them about the study. Eight partici-
pants were female (47%) and nine were male (53%).
Sixteen of the 17 (94%) were undergraduate students and
one (6%) was a graduate student. All participants were
White. Participants had spent from several months to sev-
eral years in inpatient treatment programs for addiction,
and some had resided, or still resided, in halfway houses
close to campus. Interviews were conducted in a private
room at the CRP, and interview lengths ranged from 20 to
75 min. Interviews were conducted by Ms. Anderson.
Interview guides were used to conduct the interviews.
Researchers used the overarching study questions discussed
above (What are the social experiences of students in
Scott et al. 3
recovery on campus, especially as they relate to identity
and stigma? What role does the CRP play in student cop-
ing?) to develop interview questions. Emphasis was placed
on developing a mix of questions based on both experi-
ences and perceptions, so students could discuss specific
life events and provide narratives around those events,
while also sharing the impressions and emotions that
accompanied them. The first overarching domain of ques-
tions focused on students' experiences (a) with substance
use and treatment before coming to campus, (b) with the
initial transition to campus life, and (c) with coping skills
and resources they used at these times. Example questions
include "How did the recovery process start for you?" and
"What was your first week on campus like?" The second
domain explored experiences with the CRP and the role it
played in their coping and identity on campus. Questions
were asked about (a) specific CRP services ("What are your
impressions of the weekly seminars?") as well as (b) the
broader role of the CRP in their campus experience ("How
has [the CRP] been a part of your life here on campus?").
Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Content analy-
sis of interview transcripts and field notes was iterative
(ongoing during data collection), using the editing approach
described by Crabtree and Miller (1999). This approach was
selected because it provided a structured way to examine the
text data while also providing the ability to work with larger
segments of data (up to several paragraphs) as a single ana-
lytic unit. This allowed narratives about specific experi-
ences to remain intact during analysis. Transcripts were
coded to identify text segments related to each question
domain, which were grouped together for analysis by code
(Crabtree & Miller, 1999). The research team collaborated
to develop the coding schema, and codes were assigned to a
minimum of two researchers. Coding discrepancies were
resolved through discussion, to enhance dependability.
Following the coding process, themes were identified within
each domain and expanded using reflexive memo-writing
(Birks, Chapman, & Francis, 2008). Dr. Scott took the lead
on this portion of the process. Documentation of this pro-
cess served as a form of confirmability. Themes that emerged
from content analysis and memo-writing were triangulated
by having all researchers involved in analysis. Themes iden-
tified were discussed with select study participants as a form
of member checking (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), to see whether
the research team's conclusions were credible in the eyes of
the students.
Findings
Content analysis generated five themes. The first three relate
to the experience of campus life for CRP students. The last
two themes relate to the CRP itself and the role it played as a
student resource for social support and the reconstruction of
identity. These themes are discussed individually in the sec-
tions that follow.
Campus Life: Returning to College After
Treatment
Students varied in the length of time they spent in inpatient
addiction treatment, ranging from several months to several
years. Coming back to school was part of a process of re-
entering the world of day-to-day living. In most cases, stu-
dents were grateful for their time in these programs and
viewed the experience as life-saving. But for many, the loss
of the rigid structures and routines of treatment, with the sup-
port networks they had there, made for a challenging transi-
tion back into school. "Rudderless," "self-conscious," and
"vulnerable" were terms used to describe the transition. The
students spoke of the adjustment period in terms of starting
from scratch, having to rebuild daily routines, habits, and
coping mechanisms. One student described it in this way: "If
you're just getting out of treatment . . . you don't know what
to do, you don't have the rules to guide you, or any of that
kind of stuff. That's just the nature of the beast." A few
women interviewed said that they found it especially daunt-
ing to relate to men again, because they were isolated from
them during treatment:
I'd been in a halfway house with just sober people for so long,
and the rules there . . . I couldn't even really talk to boys! And
then I come on campus, and it's like, "Oh, my god!" . . . it was
really uncomfortable and awkward at first.
This awkwardness extended more generally to the class-
room. Most of those interviewed said they were very quiet in
classes at the beginning, trying to "get social skills back" and
re-learn the art of casual interaction.
Layered upon this was the challenge of remaining sober
on a college campus that had the reputation of being a
"party school" in the region. As explained by one CRP
student, "Students come here because they think it's a
party school, especially from these boring-ass country
towns . . . [site of university] is a Mecca, you know. They
like to pilgrimage here." Alcohol and discussions of it
were ubiquitous in class, in dorms, in study groups, walk-
ing on campus, and in the student center, according to
interview participants. Hearing these exchanges between
others was one challenge; being invited to participate
posed an even bigger threat to coping. One woman in
recovery from alcohol addiction described being invited
to a bar by a classmate:
I remember one of my first classes I was in . . . I was still in
treatment, and I had a guy ask me to go to a bar . . . I tried to play
it cool and stuff, like, "I don't drink or anything like that," but it
messed me up, cause it was like my first experience with
somebody trying to offer.
Classmates were not the only source of pressure to drink.
In some cases, students in recovery reported that professors
talked about drinking during class, making the classroom
4 SAGE Open
setting additionally stressful. Here, a student describes a pro-
fessor's "drinking talk":
I'm almost sure [he] was a drunk, because he mentioned alcohol
almost every day in class, and said some things that I would've
said back in the day. . . . When teachers, of all people, are talking
at length about drinking . . . I don't want to hear about that.
With other students, he could draw clear lines about what he
would discuss. His professor's discussion, however, was out-
side of his control.
Campus Life: Feelings of Exclusion
CRP students described a campus environment where alco-
hol and other substances seemed to be everywhere. As a
result, alcohol consumption and, to a lesser degree, use of
drugs like marijuana or Adderall were perceived as "typical"
by the CRP students. Many CRP students interviewed
reported that "Everybody drinks!" and they were hard-
pressed to find anyone who did not adhere to that norm. As
one woman expressed, "I think the hardest thing for people
in recovery here [is that] I don't know anyone who is not
drinking, and I'm not going to go somewhere where people
are drinking. It's not smart for my recovery."
Avoiding functions that might serve alcohol effectively
excluded CRP students from most social events on campus,
according to interview participants.
Some participants, while being committed to recovery,
regretted missing out on the "partying," which was seen as
part of the college experience, and rite of passage to adult-
hood in modern American life:
Part of me feels due that college experience. For a lot of us it's a
rite of passage, you fly the nest, and you get those years of
irresponsibility before it's time to have a career. . . . I'm a young
man, you know. I'd like to chase women, and to go to parties and
that kind of thing, but unfortunately . . . I can't successfully drink
and use drugs, and stuff like that . . . I have a deeper understanding
of where my place is, but sometimes I just wish . . .
He takes responsibility for his situation, but regrets the loss
of those experiences.
Some CRP students struggled to find their way in to "nor-
mal" student life. One woman lamented, "What do I do?
What do I do to fit in, and what do I do to have fun? What do
I do to be normal, a normal college student? " For most stu-
dents interviewed, this frustration was most acute during the
initial transition period.
Abstinence was not the only characteristic that CRP stu-
dents perceived as setting them apart from their peers. CRP
students tended to be older than their classmates and were
likely to be living independently and working outside school,
unlike many students on campus. They felt that they were
more studious and focused than many of their classmates.All
these factors contributed to the sense of differentness. One
man in his mid-20s described how all these issues inter-
twined in his early days on campus:
When I first came to school here it was really uncomfortable and
awkward . . . I was 23 years old, I was in all freshman classes,
and it was these kids who had just gotten out of high school . . .
they were talking about drinking all the time in class. I'm like
this nerd who's like doing all my homework, and they're like
"Oh, I got so wasted." . . . I was also living in a halfway house,
so I had that fear, like I had "halfway house addict" on my
forehead or something.
He was explicit describing his feeling of being stigmatized.
Others referred to feeling like "freaks" and "just want[ing] to
be normal."
The stigma here is complex. CRP students long to shed
the stigmatized identity of "addict" as they transition to life
as college students; however, by virtue of their sobriety, they
are atypical on campus as well, because they must resist the
prevailing norms and cannot take on the identity embraced
by their student peers. So, in some sense, they are forced to
exchange one stigmatized identity for another, or perhaps to
carry them both at the same time.
Some CRP students found psychological strategies for
resolving these mental struggles. One strategy for this
involved focusing on other groups who were outside the per-
ceived mainstream and finding common cause. For example,
one woman related her exclusion to that of students in wheel-
chairs: "You see people wheeling around in wheelchairs
around here. And I mean, some things in life you just don't
get. I don't get to drink. It's not a big deal, most of the time."
This thinking helped to neutralize her situation and also gave
her solidarity with another group of students on campus.
Campus Life: Disclosure
With the burden of non-normative, yet largely hidden, identi-
ties came issues of disclosing these identities, or "breaking
anonymity." The students interviewed handled this in a range
of ways. Some CRP students were very open about the fact
they were in recovery, both to students and professors:
Hey, I'm [name] and I'm in recovery. I don't even care I just
broke my anonymity! . . . I have not found a single person who
has been like "Ewww!" when I told them I was in recovery. If
anything they've been like "Wow, that's really cool. Good for
you, and you're in school?"
In her case, disclosure had been a positive experience, and
people's reactions had helped her frame her identity as dif-
ferent, but not necessarily negative. Being admired for her
ability to overcome adversity, to deal with addiction, and go
to school at the same time provided a powerful boost. Most
CRP students, however, were more equivocal. Some dis-
closed to professors but not to other students, others told cer-
tain classmates as they became acquainted, others were
Scott et al. 5
happy to discuss it on campus, but did not want to speak or
advocate beyond. The fear of being judged was powerful for
some: "I'm still kind of iffy about all that. I still kind of pick
and choose, you know. But I'm twenty-one years old and,
and I still am worried about what others think of me."
The work of managing disclosure, making decisions
about whom to tell and when, and bracing for people's reac-
tions, constitutes an additional strain for CRP students strug-
gling to redefine themselves. Next, we examine the role the
CRP on campus played in buffering these struggles and aid-
ing the students in claiming a positive identity, that of a stu-
dent in recovery.
Role of the CRP: Social Support
In 2008, a CRP was established at the university. The CRP
had a staff comprised of a director and a part-time graduate
assistant. The director's office served as a gathering space
for the CRP during the day. In the evenings, after public
health staff and students departed, 12-step meetings and
other CRP events convened in the building's lobby.
All interview participants were involved with CRP activi-
ties. The CRP provided a range of support services.
Instrumentally, the CRP served as a gateway for admission to
the university for some students. Felony convictions and
residence in halfway houses would have served as barriers to
enrollment for some; for these students, the CRP director
could negotiate behavior contracts and offer other support
upon admission. Once on campus, the CRP helped its stu-
dents with registration, financial aid applications, and navi-
gating the large campus grounds.
Students described the CRP as representing a "safe, com-
forting" emotional safe space, and CRP peers were a ready-
made group of friends. One woman described how all her
friends were at the CRP (the Center) and that her sense of
community was defined by it:
All my friends are basically in the Center, and the Center kind of
brings us together in a way. And it brings like a community-like
atmosphere, and it's just helpful to just even have an office to
step into.
Students described the CRP was a safe harbor, a place
where their defenses could come down. One student sum-
marized the role of the CRP this way:
Say . . . an 18 year old kid is coming [to campus], and he's
terrified . . . because he wants girls, he wants parties, and I'm--
I'm terrified for him. But at least I know he has a place he can
come, where he's not gonna feel like he's a, he's a stranger.
The CRP was an important source of social support for
interview participants. However, the CRP also provided an
important source of support in the process of identity forma-
tion, a means of coping with issues of self-redefinition and
stigma on campus.
Role of CRP: Identity
CRP students worked to develop self-definitions that sup-
ported them. One important piece of this puzzle for many
interview participants was embracing the idea of recovery.
For many students, recovery had become the cornerstone of
their new inner and outer lives. Recovery language was
tightly tied up with their experiences in treatment and their
ongoing commitment to the 12-step approach. "Working the
steps" provided the students interviewed with a scaffolding
for coping with stresses, both social and psychological.
Recovery was portrayed as a way of being, a lifestyle, or by
some, as an identity:
Everything kind of foundationed in recovery for me. . . . I'm just
the oddball out of the DT, like . . . It's more than just a lifestyle
for me, being in recovery has become an identity. . . . If you're
gonna quit drinking and doing drugs on this campus, you
probably need to drop all your friends. And reinvent yourself.
Creating a recovery-based social world was part of this cop-
ing process for most. Recreating yourself with a recovery
identity required a recovery-based social circle, activities
and hobbies, and places to socialize.
It often required new physical geographies as well.
Almost every person interviewed had moved after leaving
treatment, often to another state. Only one woman inter-
viewed had been a student at the university before becoming
sober, and she struggled to reconcile her pre-treatment and
recovery worlds.
I didn't want to lose the people, just the substances, but that
doesn't work. It took me probably six months to figure that out.
. . . It's a little uncomfortable when I see them around town,
because I had to tell them that. "No, I cannot hang out with you.
I cannot come see you. I cannot come watch a movie with you."
Reinventing herself as someone in recovery was a daunting
task, when all the reminders of her life before recovery were
still around her every day.
The CRP played a critical role for many interview partici-
pants by providing recovery-based activities, friends, and
social settings. Being involved in this social world created a
safe space for the recovery identity to take root and grow,
along with ties to 12-step groups through the CRP or in the
community. These activities and friends were all campus-
based and campus-oriented; in short, they allowed the par-
ticipants to be students, as well as people in recovery.
Through the CRP, then, many found a way to bring together
a "recovery identity" and a "student identity." These two
identities coalesced around the very existence of the CRP,
physically and conceptually. Through the CRP, they were
"students in recovery."
Claiming this identity, and assuring that it was one viewed
positively by the outside world, created work of its own. It
was intertwined with the reputation of the CRP, first and
6 SAGE Open
foremost, so the image of the program was seen as para-
mount to the students individually and collectively. Many
spoke of the need to prove themselves and make a name for
the CRP, lest people assume they were still "just a bunch of
loser addicts." They were quick to point out that the mean
grade point average (GPA) of CRP students was higher than
the campus average, that many were on the dean's and presi-
dent's lists, and to describe their broad range of campus and
community service projects. It was vital to broadcast these
accomplishments to foster the identity of a student in recov-
ery as someone who was bright, hard working, and someone
who "gave back" through the CRP.
The image of the CRP was seen as a very important
responsibility by students interviewed. For example, some
students said they would leave the CRP if their grades fal-
tered. "If I dropped my GPA really low, I'd want to leave [the
CRP]. I wouldn't want to affect [the CRP]." A low GPA
would threaten the positive identity that they struggled to
cultivate and reinforce the stereotypes that the group served
to dispel. Removing oneself was seen as an altruistic gesture;
it also suggested that one would not be worthy of the "stu-
dent in recovery" mantle if she could not perform. Sentiments
like this run counter to simple explanations of social support.
Students who were struggling might lean more heavily on a
group providing social support only. But in this case, the
stakes were seen as higher and related to protecting everyone
from the pain of stigma.
This sense of responsibility also affected the sense of
openness toward new members. Participants shared the idea
that the bar for joining the group should be high: "I don't
think it would be fair to just let whoever wants in to come in
at any time. I think it would tear the program apart." This
sense of protectiveness was understandable but created the
risk of insularity and hostility to new members and added a
shadow of tension to a protected space.
On the whole, the CRP provided students in recovery a
haven, and an aid in reconstructing positive identities on
campus. Most students interviewed had reached a tenuous
equilibrium, where life was not easy, but their gratitude to be
alive and learning was plentiful. As one young man mused,
"It just blows my mind every day when I walk across campus
that I am doing this. . . . [Feigns voice of prison guard] "Wake
up, [name], it's time for you to eat. You are still in jail."
Discussion
In this article, we explore the experiences of students return-
ing to college after treatment for addiction, especially experi-
ences related to identity reconstruction. Findings suggested
that their transitions to campus life were often ambivalent.
They felt both hopeful and awkward around other students, a
finding that was echoed by Finch and Wegman (2012).
Feelings of uncertainty about where they fit in, and who they
were, were amplified by the campus environment. Some of
the challenges they noted were also noted by students
interviewed by Bell et al. (2009). They felt alcohol and some
drugs were omnipresent on campus, an idea that is consistent
with national data that show substance abuse on campuses to
be pervasive (CASA, 2007). This dynamic created a double
bind for the students interviewed, as they tried to define
recovery identities free of stigma. Sobriety itself was per-
ceived as aberrant in this campus setting. Therefore, a "nor-
mal" identity, and the sense of security and belonging that
comes with it, was felt to be out of their reach.
The CRP stepped into this space and provided the stu-
dents support, both instrumental and emotional, to cope with
these challenges. The CRP provided a gathering space, social
activities, and a group of peers, all valuable elements to the
construction of a daily life in recovery. In addition, the CRP
was a resource that helped students to establish positive iden-
tities, both as individuals and as a collective on campus. As a
part of the CRP, students could claim the identity of "student
in recovery." The CRP, in turn, was developing a positive
reputation across campus for its service work and its above-
average GPA. The CRP provided an alternate identity that
was not completely normative, but was positive, and allowed
some place to rest, both physically and symbolically.
The success rates of CRP students at this university were
not unusual. In a national survey, 90% of CRP students were
found to graduate from college, compared with 61% of their
peers on campus (Harper, 2013). This survey also confirmed
that CRP students were more likely to be older than your
typical college student, with a mean age of 25 (Laudet et al.,
2013).
These findings suggested that membership in the CRP
may be seen as a form of identity capital, a term coined by
Cote (1997). Sources of identity capital aid in the develop-
ment of stable, viable identities in emerging adults, in the
context of a lack of traditional support structures (Cote &
Schwartz, 2002). Cote has argued that all present-day youth
face hostile conditions for identity development, as many
institutional sources of identity formation have waned.
Students in recovery, then, represent a group where the need
for identity supports is exaggerated. The CRP is a tangible
asset, or scaffold, for successful identity development work.
The findings here confirm the findings of other studies that
CRPs are important sources of social support, but go further
to reflect on their added importance as sources of identity
capital. It also adds to Terrion's (2012) framework of recov-
ery capital, which examines both internal and external
resources among students in recovery, and is derived from
Putnam's (2000) idea of social capital. Identity capital
reflects the convergence of internal and external resources,
rather than making a discrete inventory of the two, to aid
students in recovery.
The student population here was predominantly White.
This is a limitation, but the lack of diversity is typical of
CRPs. Nationally, 85% of CRP students are White (Laudet
et al., 2013). Other limitations include the lack of inclusion
of students in recovery who were not involved with the CRP,
Scott et al. 7
who were by definition unknown to us, and the lack of inclu-
sion of non-CRP students. This study did not collect detailed
demographic information about study participants, or
detailed information about participants' time in treatment or
type of treatment received. This is a study weakness that
should be addressed in future studies. In addition, CRPs dif-
fer from campus to campus with regard to the services they
offer and the roles they play on campus, so the findings here
may not transfer to all CRPs. In addition, this was a rural set-
ting, a state university, and a student body of close to 20,000
students, and the experiences of college students in recovery
may vary based on these factors. Further research, qualitative
and quantitative, is needed in this area. Quantitative studies
are needed to ask whether identity and stigma issues bear on
relapse, academic success, or other indicators of well-being
in this group. How these issues function on different types of
campuses and in the presence of CRPs with different struc-
tures are additional unanswered questions.
