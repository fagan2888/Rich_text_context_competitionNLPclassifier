Objectives. We examine age differences in adults' participation in, perceived barriers to, and institutional support for
educational activities provided by schools, businesses, and community organizations in the 1990s.
Methods. We conduct descriptive and logistic regression analyses on a sample of respondents aged 30 to 74 from the
National Household Education Surveys.
Results. Adult education participation rates increased for all ages over the 1990s, but gains were proportionately
largest among people in later phases of the life course. Although age was a weaker predictor of engaging in educational
activities at the end of the 1990s than it was at the beginning of the decade, older adults continue to be less likely than
younger ones to participate in education and training provided by businesses and schools. Some of this age discrepancy
occurs because employers are more likely to provide financial support for training to younger employees. Older adults,
however, are less likely than younger adults to perceive obstacles to their participation in education and training.
Discussion. Although age-graded roles of student, worker, and retiree are becoming increasingly blurred, Ameri-
cans' pursuit of education at the end of the twentieth century was still guided by age-related role expectations.
VER the past 30 years, middle-aged and older adult
learners have emerged as a major constituency in vari-
ous educational programs. Between 1971 and 1991, the en-
rollment of full and part-time students aged 35 and older in
higher education rose by 248% (NUCEA, 1995). Participa-
tion in vocational training and work-related courses has
grown at an even faster rate (Elman, 1998). Institutes for
learning in retirement, senior centers, and community col-
leges have increased educational opportunities for senior
adults, as well (Manheimer, 1998). This trend of expanding
adult education suggests that we may be moving toward a
more age-integrated society in which people of all ages have
access to learning in universities, technical institutes, places
of employment, and community organizations. We cannot
assert this conclusion, however, because the paucity of
scholarly attention to later life education leaves many unan-
swered questions. Did education over the past decade be-
come a significantly more common experience for adults in
later life? Which education providers contributed most to
the trend in adult education participation rates and which
contributed least? What differentiates older adults who pur-
sue educational activities from those who do not? Do older
people face particular barriers to adult education that
younger adults do not?
Using data from the 1991 and 1999 National Household
Education Surveys (NHESs), this article addresses those
questions by examining adults' participation in, perceived
barriers to, and institutional support of educational activi-
ties. We first examine the decade-long trend in adults' par-
ticipation in classes provided by schools, businesses, and
community organizations, and we compare trends across
age categories. Next, we explore who is most likely to par-
ticipate in adult education, highlighting differences and sim-
ilarities by age group. Finally, we compare younger and
older adults' perceived barriers to adult education and ana-
lyze differential institutional support for engaging in educa-
tional activities.
What Is Adult Education?
Adult education is an expansive field and can be defined
in many ways. Since the 1960s and 1970s, an influential cat-
egorization of learning systems has emerged, one that dis-
tinguishes between formal, nonformal, and informal educa-
tion (Coombs, 1968; Coombs, Prosser, & Ahmed, 1973;
UNESCO, 1972). Although boundaries between these defi-
nitions may be blurry, the conceptual scheme reminds us
that education occurs both within and outside of school
walls. In this tripartite classification, formal education is the
hierarchically structured, chronologically graded education
system from primary school through university. It includes
general academic studies and a variety of specialized insti-
tutes for technical and professional training. Nonformal ed-
ucation is any organized and intentional educational activity
that takes place outside of recognized educational institu-
tions. Nonformal education occurs in libraries, businesses,
senior citizen centers, religious institutions, museums, labor
unions, and various other organizations. Learners in these
settings may receive a certificate of completion, but are not
usually seeking a degree or credential. Informal education is
a private process whereby individuals transform their daily
experiences and the educative resources in their environ-
ments into knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and beliefs
(Holford, Jarvis, & Griffin, 1998). Informal education tran-
spires in the course of daily activity, such as from reading
the newspaper or interacting with family and friends.
In addition to examining the source and content of
O
LATER LIFE EDUCATION IN THE 1990s S325
instruction, other researchers focus on adults' motivation
for pursuing education. Although some people engage in
learning for personal development (expressive orientation),
others direct their learning toward a specific outcome or ex-
ternal objective (instrumental orientation). A 1994 survey of
adult learning, for example, found that 90% of Americans
aged 64 and younger who engaged in adult education did so
for career or job-related purposes (Bélanger & Valdivielso,
1997). Older employees, as well, are motivated to acquire
new skills and knowledge to remain productive workers
(Bass & Caro, 2001). Older adults no longer in the work-
force may learn for personal enrichment and as a way to re-
main independent and socially engaged.
Although we acknowledge the value of the multiple pur-
poses for formal, nonformal, and informal education across
the life course, this paper does not examine people's motiva-
tion to learn or informal educational activities. Self-directed
learning, social interaction, and "edutainment" through the
Internet, how-to books, and informative TV programs are
important ways to increase knowledge, awareness, and
skills. Older adults especially may engage in and benefit
from informal educational activities in which no instructor
is involved. Because adult education is typically defined as
structured and institutionally based, however, our approach
in this paper is to focus on adults' participation in formal
education provided by credential programs and nonformal
education provided by business, industry, and community-
based organizations.
Who Participates and Why?
In 1969, only 10% of Americans participated in adult ed-
ucation provided by high school or college degree programs;
this number increased to 14% by 1984 (Manheimer, 1998). A
1962 survey reported that 22% of adults participated in some
type of adult education (Johnstone & Rivera, 1965); reports
from the 1990s indicate that more than 40% of adults partic-
ipated (Kim & Creighton, 1999). The most striking increase
in adult education participation rates occurred among the
nontraditional student population. In 1970, for example, less
than 10% of students in degree-granting institutions were
aged 35 and older. By 2000, 21% were (National Center for
Education Statistics [NCES], 2000).
There are numerous reasons for this rise in the number of
older students. An upward shift in the age distribution ac-
counts for much of the change (Jacobs & Stoner-Eby, 1998).
As the baby boom cohort aged, the size of the adult popula-
tion grew more rapidly than the population of traditional-
aged students. But age-specific rates of participation also
increased as the baby boom cohort moved into the stage of
life where education traditionally was uncommon. The baby
boom cohort was more highly educated than preceding co-
horts, and education level is positively related to participa-
tion in adult education. Furthermore, changes in jobs and
the development of new technology stimulated more inter-
est in lifelong learning (Bills, 2000).
As demand for later life education grew, new programs
offered educational opportunities for older adults and exist-
ing institutions adapted to meet the changing sociopolitical
climate and older learners' needs and interests. During the
1950s and 1960s, few educational programs were available
to older adults, due in part to a general emphasis on youth
culture and widely held expectations of age-related cogni-
tive declines, which were supported by prevailing research
(Manheimer, 1998). Since then, however, the creative and
learning potential of the aging population has become rec-
ognized. Viewing aging as a problem education could help
solve (Moody, 1985), legislators in the 1970s began funding
programs containing the knowledge and skills needed to
handle the challenges of aging. By the early 1980s, older
adults could take tuition-free public college courses in 38
states. Since the 1980s, federal and state governments have
played a limited role in the burgeoning growth of older
learners. Despite a 22% inflation-adjusted increase in spend-
ing by the U.S. Department of Education between 1990 and
2000, federal funds for vocational and adult education de-
creased by 37% (NCES, 2000). As public financial support
for adult education dries up, older learners have experienced
the national trend toward privatization in education. Increas-
ing numbers of private organizations--such as travel agen-
cies, corporations, college alumni organizations, brokerage
firms, and computer network clubs--offer educational oppor-
tunities to healthy, affluent older adults (Manheimer, 1998).
In fact, providing educative experiences to middle- and upper-
income older persons has become a lucrative industry.
In response to changing demographic, social, and eco-
nomic conditions, institutions of higher education are in the
process of opening their doors to a broader sector of stu-
dents (Oliver, 1999). Influenced by prevailing ideals of
social inclusion, universities seek to widen the participation
of groups who have been traditionally underrepresented on
college campuses. Older adults, for example, may for a
small fee attend class through a college-based Elderhostel
program or an Institute for Learning in Retirement.
Not all people, however, seek or benefit from the growing ed-
ucational opportunities (Elman, 1998; Manheimer, Snodgrass,
& Moskow-McKenzie, 1995; Quinnan, 1997). Earlier studies
have shown that rates vary greatly by educational attain-
ment. In 1995, about 10% of adults with an eighth grade ed-
ucation or less participated in some program of adult educa-
tion, compared with 31% of high school graduates, 57% of
bachelor's degree graduates, and 59% of people with mas-
ter's degrees (Snyder, Hoffman, & Geddes, 1997). The op-
portunity to participate in adult learning is unbalanced
between other social strata based on sex, race, and income
(Bélanger, 1999; Carnevale & Desrochers, 2000; Gower,
1997; Luttrell, 1997; O'Rand & Henretta, 1999).
In addition to these influences on differential participa-
tion rates, previous research has shown that older adults are
not as likely as younger people to engage in organized
forms of adult education (Bélanger & Valdivielso, 1997).
Older adults receive less training at work and are often dis-
placed by younger employees. These findings support Matilda
White Riley's age stratification theory (Riley, 1987), which
begins with the assumption that age, like gender and race, is
a basis for grouping people into social categories and chan-
neling them through different role expectations, opportunity
structures, and age-segregated social institutions (Riley,
1998; Riley & Riley, 2000). This "tripartition" of the life
course (Kohli, 1986) into education, work, and leisure
mapped onto the first, second, and last thirds of life is a
S326 HAMIL-LUKER AND UHLENBERG
significant barrier to educational experiences throughout
adulthood (Settersten & Lovegreen, 1998). Our current ap-
proach to education, for example, involves an intensive con-
centration in the first 25 years of life, but lacks systematic at-
tempts to update skills and knowledge throughout adulthood.
Other scholars (e.g., Settersten & Hagestad, 1996), how-
ever, point to a growing relaxation of expected age-related
transitions and argue that age is becoming less relevant as a
determinant of life course trajectories. Modell's (1989)
work, for example, examines the trend toward the loosening
of the normative transition to adulthood. He highlights the
competing forces that influence the sequencing and timing
of life course transitions. On the one hand, people's lives are
structured by normative age expectations and roles, whereas
on the other hand there is a relaxation of expected age-related
transitions. In the case of education across the life course,
we predict that younger people are more likely to engage in
formal educational programs, but that the association
between involvement and age weakened over the 1990s.
Furthermore, we predict that age differences are more
pronounced for enrollment in recognized educational in-
stitutions (e.g., college courses) than nonformal educa-
tion programs (e.g., Bible studies), which are more loosely
tied to age-graded institutions.
METHODS
Data
We use data from the NHES to examine the relationship
between demographic characteristics and participation in,
perceived barriers to, and institutional support of adult edu-
cation. The NHES is a system of telephone surveys that
randomly collects data representative of the noninstitution-
alized U.S. civilian population. The Adult Education and
Lifelong Learning component of this survey was conducted
in 1991 (N  14,892) and 1999 (N  6,679). Our samples
include respondents aged 30­74 in both cross-sectional sur-
vey years.
The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES,
1999) selected households using random digit dialing meth-
ods and collected data using computer-assisted telephone
interviewing procedures. To produce reliable estimates of
the targeted population's educational experiences, people of
color and students were oversampled. Although 95% of all
adults age 16 and older live in households with telephones
(Brick, 1996), the failure to include persons who do not live
in households with telephones could result in nonsampling
error. Because the complex sample design of the NHES de-
viates from the assumption of simple random sampling and
would underestimate the variability of parameter estimates,
we use weighted data that adjust estimates for telephone
coverage and the oversampling of adult education partici-
pants and people of color. Based on the recommendations of
the NHES Data File User's Manual (1999), we adjust the
simple random sample standard error estimate by the root
design effect.
There are several reasons why the NHES is an excellent
data source for exploring the decade-long trend of Ameri-
cans' participation in adult education. First, it provides cur-
rent data on adults' educational activities (the 1999 survey
was released in August 2000) that have not been thoroughly
analyzed. Second, the NHES is one of the few nationally re-
presentative data sets that provides comprehensive informa-
tion on adults' learning activities in organizations both inside
and outside the formal education system. Although most
surveys of adult education neglect to examine the educa-
tional activities of older adults, the NHES surveys respon-
dents in their 60s and 70s. Finally, the repeated-measures
design allows for trend analysis over the 1990s, and the
oversampling of racial and ethnic minorities increases the
reliability of estimates for these groups.
Measures
In addition to extensive background, employment, and
household information, the surveys provide reliable estimates
of adults' educational experiences in colleges, universities,
vocational programs, basic skills classes, work-related train-
ing, and personal development courses. Because we are ex-
amining changes in participation across time, slight varia-
tions in survey design between 1991 and 1999 should be
noted. In 1991, respondents were first asked about their full-
and part-time enrollment in classes for credit toward a de-
gree. Then they specified other adult education activities
they had participated in during the past 12 months. For the
four most recent classes, respondents identified who provided
the instruction. In 1999, respondents were asked about their
participation in a series of education programs: English as a
Second Language, basic skills and General Educational
Development preparation, degree programs, job-related train-
ing, and personal interest courses. Similar to the 1991 sur-
vey, respondents were then asked who provided the instruc-
tion. For all survey years, we classify respondents as either
participants (Yi
 1) or nonparticipants (Yi
 0) in adult edu-
cation provided by schools (community colleges, vocational
programs, technical institutes, and 4-year colleges and uni-
versities), business and industry, and community organiza-
tions (public libraries, neighborhood centers, community
groups, and religious organizations).
In 1991, non-full-time students reported on barriers that
prevented them from participating in adult education. For
each of the following 10 potential obstacles, we created a
dichotomous dependent variable to compare respondents
who perceived this barrier (Yi
 1) to those who did not
(Yi
 0): too busy, family responsibilities, program costs, lo-
cation of classes, class meeting time, limited course offer-
ings, lack of information about classes, no transportation,
health problems or old age, and lack of interest in or desire
to attend education programs.
Our final set of dependent variables focus on the sources
of financial support for adult education participants. For
each educational activity, respondents specified whether they
paid for the course(s) themselves (including loans), took
free classes, or received financial support from the govern-
ment or business and industry. Again, we created dichoto-
mous measures of whether or not respondents (Yi
 1 or 0)
paid for their educational activities through these various
means. Independent variables of key interest are age, sex,
race/ethnicity (White vs. non-White), education level (no
high school degree, high school degree, or college degree),
total household income over the past year (10-point scale,
LATER LIFE EDUCATION IN THE 1990s S327
where 1  less than $10,000 to 11  more than $75,000),
marital status (married vs. not married), and employment
status (worked for pay or not).
Analytical Methods
We first use descriptive statistics to assess trends in adult
education over the past decade. Then we use multivariate re-
gression analyses to explore the demographic determinants
of participation in, perceived barriers to, and institutional
support for various forms of adult education. Because we
code all dependent variables as dichotomous measures,
we use logistic regression analyses. In these models,
where Pi
is the probability that Yi

is the
probability that Yi

cients, and Xi
is the vector of observed linear predictors. The
presented coefficients are exponentiated and refer to the
odds of the dependent variable equaling one. Significant
predictors with values greater than one multiply the odds,
and significant predictors with values less than one decrease
the odds.
RESULTS
Trends in Adult Education During the 1990s
The rates at which adults in different age categories were
participating in educational programs in 1991 and 1999 are
shown in Table 1. Respondents are grouped in 8-year birth
cohorts to facilitate answering questions about trends over
this decade. Looking across a row, one can see the age pattern
in adult education in a particular year. Looking down the col-
umns, one can observe changes in participation rates for each
age category between 1991 and 1999. Looking down the di-
agonals reveals changes for cohorts as they moved from one
age category to the next over this time period.
The general age pattern of participating in adult educa-
tion is similar in both years and for each type of program.
The peak age for involvement is either 30­38 or 39­47, fol-
lowed by continuous decline after that age (with one trivial

exception). The largest differences by age occur for educa-
tion provided by schools or by business and industry, in
which the oldest age category is only about one fifth as
likely to participate as the under 50 categories. Participation
in the less formal educational activities provided by
churches and other community organizations also declines
with age, but not nearly so steeply. Despite the much her-
alded dawning of a "lifelong learning society," we find that
even at the most recent date (1999), only one fifth of the
young-old (66­74) reported that they had participated in any
educational experience in the preceding year.
Comparing participation rates in 1999 with those in 1991,
however, suggests that considerable progress was made in
extending the reach of adult education. With one minor ex-
ception, participation rates increased over the decade for
each age category in each program type. By far the largest
increase in adult education occurred in programs provided
by community organizations, where participation rates more
than doubled. Increases in these nonformal educational pro-
grams were fairly uniform across the age categories. For the
other types (provided by schools or businesses), the largest
percentage increases occurred for the two older age catego-
ries. Combining all types of adult education, the 66­74 age
category experienced the greatest increase over the 1990s.
In 1991, 8.4% of the oldest age group had taken at least one
adult education class in the previous year. By 1999, this
number had increased to 19.9%. No doubt the strong econ-
omy of the 1990s facilitated the expansion of adult educa-
tion, but it is unlikely that there will be a future retreat for
older adults. Indeed, a majority of the older population's ed-
ucational activities seem to be motivated by personal devel-
opment goals, not career goals.
Looking down the diagonals allows us to see how educa-
tional involvement changed within various cohorts as they
aged. In every educational category, the cohort aged 30­38
in 1991 (the late baby boom cohort born between 1953 and
1961) increased its level of participation in adult education
as it aged over the 1990s. For example, the proportion of co-
hort members taking courses offered by business or industry
increased from 16.5% in 1991 to 22.6% in 1999. For every
other cohort, participation rates in more formal types of ed-
ucation declined as they aged. It can be seen, however, that
declines over the 1990s for the cohorts initially aged 39­47
and 48­56 were fairly small (less than 15%). The only large
decline (32%) occurred in the area of job-related education
for the cohort that moved into old age (66­74) over the de-
cade. Each cohort more than doubled the rate at which it
participated in community provided education.
Focusing just on the older adult population (defined here
as those aged 55­74), we observe a significant increase in
participation in both formal and nonformal education pro-
grams over the 1990s. In 1991, 5.5% of older adults had
taken a course in a school or university in the previous year
compared with 8.6% in 1999. For education provided by
business and industry, older adults' participation rates rose
from 5.7% to 9.7%. The most dramatic increase occurred
for participation in community-provided education, rising
from 4.6% in 1991 to 11.6% in 1999.
How much of this increase can be attributed to a changing
propensity of older people to take courses, and how much is

simply a consequence of changing characteristics of the
older population? Compared with older adults in 1991, for
example, older respondents in 1999, on average, were more
educated, had higher incomes, and were more likely to be
employed. Based on these demographics, we might expect a
higher proportion to pursue adult education courses in 1999.
We can provide a fairly direct answer to that question by
calculating the expected change that would occur simply be-
cause of changing population characteristics. We calculate a
logistic regression analysis using the 1991 data to predict
the likelihood that a respondent had taken any course pro-
vided by schools, businesses, or community organizations
in the previous year (student  1, nonstudent  0). The in-
dependent variables in this equation were age, sex, educa-
tion, income, race, employment, and marital statuses. The
predicted probability of being a student for the average
older person in 1991, that is a person with weighted mean
characteristics of the 1991 sample, was .08. Substituting the
weighted mean characteristics for respondents in 1999 into
the 1991 logistic regression, we find the probability of being
a student increased by only 0.02. We conclude that changes
in population characteristics over this time period had little
to do with the increasing involvement of older people in edu-
cational programs. Only about one sixth of the increase can
be attributed to changes in the characteristics of the cohort oc-
cupying the 65­74 age category. Although only a minority
participates in any organized learning activity, there is a
growing propensity for older people to be active learners.
Multivariate Analyses
How much of the difference across age categories in adult
education participation rates is a result of differences in
characteristics of older versus younger people? For exam-
ple, compared with younger adults, those over age 65 tend
to have less education and lower rates of labor force partici-
pation. Previous studies report a positive relationship be-
tween years of education and participation in adult educa-
tion, and one obviously expects that employed people would
be more likely than nonemployed to take courses provided by
businesses. Thus, one might expect that controlling for educa-
tion and employment status would reduce differences in adult
education across age categories. Other potentially important
determinants of engaging in adult education include race,
gender, income and marital status, and age categories vary in
composition related to each of these variables. Using a multi-
variate model, we can examine whether the relationship be-
tween age and adult education is, at least to some extent, a
consequence of age-related differences in these various
characteristics. Based on the results of the multivariate anal-
ysis shown in Table 2, we make three observations.
First, many of the independent variables had a significant
effect on the likelihood of engaging in adult education. As
expected, education and employment status were significant
determinants of participation in adult education. In both
1991 and 1999, those who had completed college were sig-
nificantly more likely to participate in each type of adult ed-
ucation than those with a high school degree, whereas those
with less than a high school education were not even half as
likely to participate as those who graduated from high school.
Controlling for other factors, those who were employed were
more than four times as likely to have participated in an edu-
cational program provided by business or industry as those
who were not employed. Employed persons also had greater
odds of taking courses offered by schools in 1999, but em-
ployment status was not a significant predictor of participat-
ing in programs provided by community organizations.
In addition to employment and education, gender and
income tended to be significant predictors of engagement
in adult education. Females had greater odds than males of
participating in educational programs provided by schools
and community organizations, and persons with higher
incomes were more likely to engage in all types of adult edu-
cation. On the other hand, controlling for other factors, partic-
ipation rates did not vary much by marital status and race.

LATER LIFE EDUCATION IN THE 1990s S329
There was, however, one interesting exception. In 1991, non-
Hispanic Whites were more likely than others to participate
in adult education provided by business or industry, but in
1999 this distinction no longer existed. This finding sug-
gests that employers' racial discrimination in the provision
of training programs may have been declining over this time
period. Other possible explanations include increasing edu-
cational and occupational status among people of color and
changes in labor force composition because of immigration.
Second, the age discrepancy in taking courses offered by
schools or businesses was reduced when other variables
were included in the model. The odds ratios for younger ver-
sus older persons taking courses offered by schools are sub-
stantially lower in the multivariate analysis than in the bivari-
ate analysis. For example, simple cross-tabulations indicate
that, in 1999, the odds ratio for those aged 30­38 taking a
course offered by schools was 6.2 times that of those aged
66­74. But, as shown in Table 2, this odds ratio is reduced to
3.5 when other factors are included in the model. Controlling
for other variables consistently had a larger effect in 1999
than in 1991, although the odds ratios were lower in the
multivariate model than in the bivariate model for each
younger age category relative to the oldest one in both years.
Controlling for other factors has an even greater effect on
the differences across age categories in taking courses pro-
vided by business. The odds ratio of someone aged 39­47
versus someone aged 66­74 engaging in this type of adult
education in 1991 falls from 14.0 to 3.9 as one moves from
a bivariate to a multivariate analysis. The same comparison
in 1999 shows a drop from 5.6 to 1.9. These big effects are,
of course, primarily because of the tendency for business or
industry provided courses to be job related, so that retired
persons are unlikely to participate. In contrast to other types
of education, the relationship between age and taking courses
offered by community organizations is hardly changed when
other variables are taken into account.
Third, controlling for other variables does not eliminate
the significant effect of age on participating in adult educa-
tion provided by schools or businesses. The odds ratios
shown in Table 2 indicate that, in 1999, net of other factors
in the model, people aged 30­47 are about twice as likely as
people aged 66­74 to take courses offered by businesses,
and about three times as likely to take classes offered by
schools. It is only in programs run by churches, libraries,
and other community organizations that age is not a signifi-
cant predictor of participation. The results of this analysis
also suggest that the time in the life course when age begins
to be a barrier to participating in adult education occurs be-
fore old age. Indeed, the likelihood of participating in adult
education is not significantly different for those aged 57­65
and those aged 66­74.
We have seen that older adults have lower odds than
younger adults of participating in education programs pro-
vided by schools and businesses. Such age differences do
not exist, however, in the likelihood of taking courses pro-
vided by community organizations. Why? Do older adults in
general face more barriers to their participation in adult edu-
cation than younger adults? One might speculate that older
adults are more likely to have health problems that prevent
them from attending, or might find it more difficult to
arrange transportation to classes. These hypotheses can be
examined using data from the 1991 NHES, which asked re-
spondents to identify personal reasons for not participating
in adult education. Table 3 presents the odds ratios of
younger age groups perceiving specific barriers to their par-
ticipation, compared with those aged 66 to 74. These logis-
tic regression models include controls for sex, education, in-
come, race, employment, and marital status, but here we
focus only on age differences.
Curiously, although older adults are less likely to be stu-
dents, they are also less likely to cite various obstacles to
their participation. Respondents aged 30­38, for example,
are almost 6 times as likely as those aged 66­74 to state that
program costs prevent them from taking classes, even when
controlling for household income. Younger age groups are
also more likely to cite family responsibilities, busy sched-
ules, and lack of information about classes. Interestingly,
those aged 57­65 are not significantly different from those
aged 66­74 in their odds of perceiving obstacles to adult ed-
ucation. Older adults are no more likely than younger adults
to cite lack of interest, transportation, or good health as bar-
riers to their participation in education programs.
Table 3 reports individual perceptions of barriers or stated
explanations for not participating in adult education. But
there may be factors beyond individual impediments and
motivations that limit older people's involvement in educa-
tional programs. Are there institutional forces that give
younger adults an advantage over older ones for engaging in
education programs? We investigate this through a series of
logistic regressions where the dependent variable is whether
or not students received financial support for participating in
educational programs. As shown in Table 4, several of the
control variables affect sources of support. Female students
are more likely than male students to use their own funds to
pay for their education. Business and industry is more likely
to provide financial support to non-Hispanic Whites, those
with a high school degree, and those with higher household
incomes. Receipt of financial support from the government

is most likely for students in credential programs, whereas
respondents in community-based programs are most likely
to take free classes.
Our primary interest is whether there is evidence that
older adults receive less institutional support than younger
ones for adult education. Results in Table 4 indicate that
there are no statistically significant age differences in the
odds of adult education participants receiving financial as-
sistance from the government or taking free courses. Re-
spondents in their 30s, 40s, and early 50s, however, are
more than three times as likely as those aged 66­74 to re-
ceive financial support from business and industry, even
when controlling for employment status. Separate analyses,
not presented here, of a sample of employed formal adult
education participants showed that employers are almost
twice as likely to give younger employees time off from
work to attend classes or pay at least part of the costs of ed-
ucation as they are to give these benefits to older employees.
This finding is in line with previous research showing that
employers often stop investing in older employees because
of their stereotypical views of older workers as not easily
trained and less productive than younger workers (Ameri-
can Association of Retired Persons, 1995; Global Aging Re-
port, 1998; Rosen & Jerdee, 1985).
DISCUSSION
Analyzing NHES data from the 1990s leads to several
straightforward findings. We conclude by highlighting four
of these and discussing their implications. First, over the
1990s, an increasing proportion of older people participated
in educational activities. The rise in adult education affected
all ages, but gains were proportionately largest among people
in later phases of the life course. Almost certainly, the pro-
portion of older people participating in adult education
classes in 1999 was unprecedented. This outcome might
have been expected simply because the general educational
level of older people was increasing, and educational attain-
ment is positively associated with engagement in lifelong
learning. However, most of the gains in later life education
in the 1990s cannot be explained by changes in cohort char-
acteristics. Formal and nonformal educational programs ap-
pear to have succeeded in reaching adults who previously
would not have been involved.
Second, older adults continue to be less likely than younger
ones to participate in education and training provided by
businesses and schools. In fact, about 90% of the young-old
population was not involved. Some of this age discrepancy
occurs because employers are more likely to provide finan-
cial support for training to younger employees. But, there is
evidence that much of the reason is associated with role ex-
pectations. Older adults' failure to cite barriers to participat-
ing in educational activities may reflect internalized age ex-
pectations. In 1991, for example, 92% of adults aged 66­74
did not engage in structured learning. Of those respondents,
only one third provided a reason for their lack of engagement
in educational activities when prompted. Older adults appear
to accept the notion that engaging in formal education is a re-
sponsibility and a right for the young. In contrast, younger
adults are not only more involved than older ones in adult ed-
ucation, but also they are more likely to perceive family re-
sponsibilities and work schedules as obstacles to participat-
ing in educational activities. Thus, Americans' pursuit of
education at the end of the twentieth century is still guided
by age-related role expectations.
Third, in contrast to their younger counterparts, older
people are more likely to engage in educational activities
provided by community organizations than in credential
programs or job related training. The priority of nonformal
over formal education in later life is in keeping with the cul-
tural expectation that older adults pursue leisure activities. But,
the importance of Bible studies, book discussion groups,
and self-help classes as educational activities should not be
discounted. It seems likely that the most promising way to
extend the outreach of education in later life is to offer pro-
grams that older people identify as personally rewarding.
Indeed, educators should be encouraged to find students
who are motivated by other than vocational concerns. If goals
of lifelong learning are intellectual growth and engagement
with the world, there is no reason to assume that nonformal
education is inferior to formal education.
Fourth, age was a weaker predictor of participation in
adult education at the end of the 1990s than it was at the be-
ginning of the decade. The multivariate analysis shows that
the odd ratios associated with age declined between 1991
and 1999 for each type of adult education. These findings
support the argument that age-graded roles of student,
worker, and retiree are becoming increasingly blurred. If, as
some argue, the life course is becoming less rigidly struc-
tured and experienced, we may be moving toward an age-
integrated society in which opportunities for education are
open to people of all ages and in which people of diverse
ages learn together. Before concluding that educational pro-
grams are breaking down age segregation, however, we will
need more information about the context in which education

occurs. Elderhostel, discussion groups at senior centers, and
golden-age classes in churches may serve important educa-
tional purposes, but they do not promote age integration.
Age homogeneous groupings limit opportunities for learn-
ing to be enriched by interaction between people with di-
verse life experiences, and they do not facilitate strengthen-
ing intergenerational relationships.
Later life education has an important role to play both in
promoting increasing age integration and in enlarging the
productive contribution of older people to society. Trends of
increased longevity, earlier retirement, and improved health
will provide increased opportunities for integrating educa-
tion throughout adulthood. Expanding education across the
life course, however, is not simply a matter of removing eas-
ily identified barriers, such as lack of transportation or ex-
pensive tuition. Many older adults underestimate their own
capacity to learn and accept the notion that they should
leave formal education programs at prescribed ages. To
truly become a "lifelong learning society," cultural values
must be adjusted and educational institutions must be reor-
ganized to meet older adults' needs and interests. Further
development of public policy and increased state and fed-
eral support for lifelong learning opportunities are needed.
