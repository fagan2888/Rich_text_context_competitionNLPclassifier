Growing research documents links between positive psy-
chological functioning and multiple aspects of physical
health (Pressman and Cohen, 2005), including mortality
(Chida and Steptoe, 2008), cardiovascular disease (Boehm
and Kubzansky, 2012), biological risk factors for disease
(Friedman et al., 2007; Ryff et al., 2006; Tsenkova et al.,
2008), infectious illness (Cohen et al., 2006), and dementia
and disability in later life (Boyle et al., 2010a, 2010b). Most
evidence to date, however, has been cross-sectional in
nature. Longitudinal data are required to determine whether
change in multiple indices of health, assessed over a 9- to
10-year period, can be predicted from cumulative profiles
(i.e. persistently high vs persistently low levels) of psycho-
logical well-being (PWB).
We focus on eudaimonic well-being (Ryff, 1989; Ryff
and Keyes, 1995), built on the integration of developmen-
tal, existential, and humanistic theories as well as distant
input from Aristotle (Ryff, 2014; Ryff and Singer, 2006).
The model includes multiple dimensions, such as having a
sense of purpose in life, experiencing personal growth, and
enjoying quality social relationships with others. Prior
cross-sectional evidence has linked the scales with a range
of health outcomes, including chronic medical conditions
(Friedman and Ryff, 2012), sleep quality (Friedman, 2011;
Friedman et al., 2005), inflammation (Friedman et al.,
2007; Morozink et al., 2010), cardiovascular risk (Boehm
and Kubzansky, 2012), and endocrine function (Ryff et al.,
2004). Well-being has also been found to moderate rela-
tionships between various kinds of adversity, including
educational disadvantage (Morozink et al., 2010), chronic
conditions (Friedman and Ryff, 2012), sleep quality
(Friedman, 2011; Friedman et al., 2005), and inflammation.
Limited longitudinal work has been conducted, although
high purpose in life has been linked prospectively with
reduced risk of morbidity and mortality (Boyle et al., 2009,
2010a, 2010b; Hill and Turiano, 2014; Kim et al., 2013a,
Persistent psychological well-being
predicts improved self-rated health

Abstract
Psychological well-being has been linked with better health, but mostly with cross-sectional evidence. Using MIDUS,
a national sample of US adults (N
=
4963), longitudinal profiles of well-being were used to predict cross-time change
in self-reported health over 9­10
years. Well-being was largely stable, although adults differed in whether they had
persistently high versus persistently low or moderate levels of well-being. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors,
those with persistently high well-being reported better health (subjective health, chronic conditions, symptoms, and
functional impairment) across time compared to those with persistently low well-being. Furthermore, persistently
high well-being was protective of improved health especially among the educationally disadvantaged. The findings
underscore the importance of intervention and educational programs designed to promote well-being for greater
segments of society.

vices (Kim et al., 2014).
The current investigation connects longitudinal pro-
files of well-being to change in self-reported physical
health assessed over a 9- to 10-year period. Whether high
well-being across time is protective of better health in the
context of adversity, defined as low educational standing,
is also examined. Educational gradients in health have
been well documented, with low education predictive of
elevated risk of disease and mortality (Adler et al., 1994;
CrimminsandSaito,2001;Lantzetal.,1998).Nonetheless,
high levels of PWB have been linked with reduced inflam-
mation (interleukin-6) among educationally disadvan-
taged adults (Morozink et al., 2010). Such work adds to
the growing body of research documenting the health
benefits of psychological and social strengths among
those lacking high economic or educational standing
(Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Miller et al., 2011; Turiano
et al., 2014). The focus on socioeconomic adversity in the
present inquiry thus provides a more stringent test of
whether health benefits of persistently high well-being are
evident in vulnerable (socio-economically disadvantaged)
segments of the population.
We utilize multiple self-report indicators of physical
health: self-rated health, chronic conditions, physical
symptoms, and functional limitations. Self-rated health is
a subjective global assessment of health status and in mul-
tiple studies and countries has been robustly linked to
health outcomes, including mortality (Idler and Benyamini,
1997; Jylhä, 2009), independently of objective health
measures. Furthermore, dynamic profiles of self-rated
health have been linked with psychosocial factors. In a
longitudinal study of Taiwan elders, consistently low self-
rated health across a 14-year period was predicted by
higher baseline scores on the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (Lee et al., 2012). For
more specific health assessments, such as chronic condi-
tions and physical symptoms, the associations with well-
being tend to be bi-directional, with lower baseline levels
of well-being predicting subsequent poorer health as well
as poorer health predicting lower well-being (Steptoe
et al., 2015). Importantly, clinical studies have shown that
participant reports of chronic illnesses closely match
administrative data and medical records (Katz et al., 1996;
Kriegsman et al., 1996). Finally, higher levels of PWB,
including purpose in life, have been associated with
reduced risk of disability (Boyle et al., 2010b; Ostir et al.,
2000). This diverse array of physical health indicators, all
commonly used in life course studies, is valuable for clari-
fying whether persistently high well-being is predictive of
better cross-time health in particular domains or shows
broader impact across all four indicators.
Although longitudinal analyses frequently use baseline
measures of well-being to predict subsequent change in
health, our analyses focus instead on cumulative profiles of
well-being. The rationale is that most respondents had
highly stable profiles of well-being across time, although at
notably different levels (low, medium, and high). Key
hypotheses were that (1) those with persistently high PWB
would show better health at Time 2 (controlling for Time 1
health) compared to those with persistently low or moder-
ate levels of PWB, and (2) persistently high (vs low) well-
being would moderate the linkages between educational
status and cross-time health. That is, stable high PWB
would predict better Time 2 health especially among the
educationally disadvantaged, thus demonstrating protective
health benefits of high PWB in vulnerable subgroups. To
determine whether the cumulative well-being approach
affords substantive advances over use of baseline well-
being alone, findings from the two approaches were also
compared.
Methods
Sample
Participants were from the Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS) survey, conducted in 1995­1996 and 2004­
2005. A national sample of 7108 non-institutionalized
adults included a random digit dialing (RDD) telephone
survey, with oversampling in five cities (related to geo-
graphic-specific agendas) (n=4244), plus a sibling sam-
ple of the main-sample respondents (n=950). Also
included was a national twin sample (n=1914; 957 pairs),
generated by screening a representative national sample of
approximately 50,000 households for the presence of a
twin (as part of ongoing national omnibus surveys). The
baseline survey employed a 30-minute phone interview
followed by two Self-Administered Questionnaires
(SAQs), mailed to individuals after completing the phone
interview. Response rates for the phone survey were: RDD
sample (70%), siblings (64%), and twins (60%). Among
these individuals, response rates for the SAQs were: RDD
sample (87%), siblings (81%), and twins (92%).
With support from the National Institute on Aging, a
longitudinal follow-up was initiated in 2004. The Time 2
data collection used the original protocol: following suc-
cessful completion of a 30-minute phone interview, partici-
pants were mailed two SAQs. Of the original 7108
participants completing the phone survey at baseline, 4963
(70%) were successfully re-contacted and completed the
phone survey 9­10
years later. Adjusted for mortality, the
overall retention rate was 75
percent (see Radler and Ryff
(2010) for details on attrition). Separate retention rates
were: RDD sample (69%), siblings (81%), and twins
(81%). Comparison of the longitudinal and baseline
MIDUS samples revealed the usual selective bias evident
in prior research--namely, that retention rates were higher
among those in better health and with more education at
baseline as well as among women, Whites, and married
Ryff et al. 3
individuals (Radler and Ryff, 2010). Approximately, 3900
participants completed the Ryff's PWB scales (Ryff, 1989)
at each of the two occasions of measurement and were thus
included in analyses that follow. At Time 2, the ages of
these participants ranged from 32 to 84years.
Measures
The demographic variables included baseline characteristics
of age (continuous), gender (0=male, 1=female), and edu-
cational level (1
=
no school/some grade school, 12
=
PhD,
MD, or other professional degree). PWB was measured with
six scales (Ryff, 1989): autonomy, environmental mastery,
personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in
life, and self-acceptance. Each scale consisted of three
items,withamixofpositiveandnegativeitems.Respondents
indicated the extent (from 1 strongly agree to 7 strongly
disagree) to which the statements described them. Negative
items were reverse coded so that higher scores reflected
more positive appraisals. Summed scores were created from
all scales. Table 1 provides summary statistics and cross-
time correlations for these measures.
Four physical health outcomes (Time 2) were examined:
(1) self-reported physical health (1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good,
4
=
very good, and 5
=
excellent); (2) number of chronic
conditions (such as asthma, stomach problems, and diabe-
tes; range=0­30); (3) frequency (past 30days) of physical
symptoms such as headaches, joint problems, difficulty
sleeping, and so on (0=not at all, 1=once a month, 2=sev-
eral times a month, 3
=
once a week, 4
=
several times a
week, and 5
=
almost every day; range
=
0­48); and (4)
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) where higher
scores indicated more functional limitations. Summary sta-
tistics of health at both Time 1 and Time 2 as well as cross-
time correlations for these variables are given in Table 1.
Longitudinal trajectories of well-being
Baseline psychological factors, such as personality traits
(e.g. neuroticism, conscientiousness), are often used to pre-
dict cross-time health, such as heightened risk of illness or
death (Mroczek and Spiro, 2007; Turiano et al., 2012). An
alternative approach uses longitudinal trajectories of psy-
chosocial factors to predict changing health. This strategy
may be particularly useful when psychological factors are
highly stable as it allows emphasis on cumulative effects
across time. Most MIDUS participants, in fact, had stable
profiles of well-being over the 9- to 10-year period: using
the index of reliable change (Christensen and Mendoza,
1986), more than 90percent of respondents did not reliably
increase or decrease on any dimension of well-being over
9­10years. Nonetheless, they were stable at different lev-
els, with some individuals showing persistently high and
others persistently low or moderate levels of well-being
across time.
To classify respondents into cumulative subgroups, a
typology was created wherein each respondent was jointly
characterized based on Time 1 and Time 2 well-being. Such
cross-classification could be done in multiple ways (i.e.
using tertiles, quartiles, or quintiles of distributions at each
time point). We examined all three possibilities and ulti-
mately selected quartiles so as to produce a typology of
change and stability that was neither too undifferentiated
(tertiles) nor too granular (quintiles). That is, the goal was
to find the optimal balance between using overly loose
(large subgroups) versus overly strict (small cell sizes)
cross-time classification criteria.
As illustrated in Figure 1, quartiles made it possible to
identify respondents who were stable (at low, medium, and
high levels) across the two waves as well as those who
increased or decreased across time. Change was defined as
moving upward, or downward, 2+ quartiles from Time 1 to
Time 2. We chose this criterion based on its comparability
with reliable change index (Christensen and Mendoza,
1986), which is slightly more conservative. Thus, our
resulting typology classified the majority (78%­83%) of
respondents as stable at low, medium, or high levels, with
the rest (17%­22%) classified as increasing or decreasing.
Contrasts between these categorical groups were then used
to predict changing profiles of health.
Results
Stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed using
the four Time 2 health variables as outcomes. In the first step,
age, education, gender, and Time 1 health were entered. By
entering the Time 1 health, the dependent variable (Time 2
health) focused on residualized change in health. In the

second step, dummy-coded variables for PWB were entered,
with stable hi serving as the referent category compared to
the other groups (stable low (stable lo), stable mid, increas-
ing, and decreasing). In the tables that follow, no contrasts of
stable hi with increasing are included because few such
effects were obtained across the four outcome variables. To
test whether persistently high well-being afforded greater
protective health benefits among the less educated, a third
step entered interaction term of education with stable lo ver-
sus stable hi. Significant interactions were graphed using the
derived regression equation for each model. Middle, low,
and high education levels in such graphs were, respectively,
defined as the mean and 1 standard deviation below and
above the mean.
Subjective health
Table 2 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses pre-
dicting Time 2 subjective health from cumulative profiles of
PWB, after adjusting for education, age, gender, and Time 1
health. For all six scales of well-being (as well as for the
overall composite), those with stable lo profiles had worse
cross-time health compared to those with stable hi well-
being. In addition, for three domains of well-being (environ-
mental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance), those
with stable mid well-being had significantly worse cross-
time health compared to those with stable hi well-being. For
all scales except autonomy, those with decreasing well-being
had poorer health at Time 2 (net of Time 1) compared to
those with stable hi well-being.
Interaction analyses contrasting stable lo versus hi well-
being at different levels of education showed significant

effects for autonomy, environmental mastery, personal
growth, and positive relations with others. The pattern,
illustrated for positive relations in Figure 2(a), shows the
predicted protective influence: among those with stable hi
positive relations, there is little difference in Time 2 health
as a function of education, whereas among those with sta-
ble lo quality ties to others, those with limited educational
attainment had poorer health compared to those with higher
educational standing. This same pattern was also evident
for autonomy, environmental mastery, and personal growth.
Chronic conditions
Table 3 shows the results of hierarchical regression analyses
predicting Time 2 chronic conditions from cumulative pro-
files of PWB, after controlling for education, age, gender,
and Time 1 chronic conditions. Across all dimensions of
well-being (as well as for the overall composite), those with
stable lo well-being showed greater increments in chronic
conditions compared to those with stable hi well-being. In
addition, for environmental mastery and self-acceptance,
those with stable mid well-being had significantly greater
increments in chronic conditions compared to those with
stable hi well-being. For all scales of well-being except
autonomy, those with decreasing profiles of well-being also
showed significantly greater increments in chronic condi-
tions compared to those with stable hi well-being.
Interaction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo
well-being at different levels of education revealed a sig-
nificant effect only for autonomy. The effect, illustrated in
Figure 2(b), shows that among those with stable hi auton-
omy, educational status does not matter in predicting cross-
time changes in chronic conditions. However, among those
with stable lo autonomy, there is a gradient in chronic con-
ditions wherein less educated show greater increments
across time compared to those with high educational stand-
ing. Thus, persistently high autonomy served as a protec-
tive factor against cross-time increments in chronic
conditions among the less educated.
Health symptoms
Table 4 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses pre-
dicting Time 2 health symptoms from cumulative profiles of
PWB, after controlling for education, age, gender, and Time 1

were significantly higher for those with stable lo compared to

well as for the overall composite). In addition, those with sta-
ble mid well-being had significantly greater increments in
health symptoms compared to those with stable hi well-being
for four dimensions of well-being (autonomy, environmental
mastery, personal growth, and self-acceptance). For all scales
of well-being except purpose in life, those with decreasing
profiles of well-being also showed significantly greater incre-
ments in health symptoms across time compared to those
with stable hi well-being.
Interaction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo
well-being at different levels of education revealed signifi-
cant effects for autonomy and environmental mastery. This
effect is illustrated for environmental mastery in Figure
2(c) and shows that among those with stable lo environ-
mental mastery, there is a gradient in which the less edu-
cated show greater increments in health symptoms across
time compared to those with higher educational standing.
Alternatively, persistently high environmental mastery
served as a protective buffer against cross-time increments
in symptoms conditions among the less educated. The same
pattern was obtained for autonomy.
Functional health (IADLs)
Table 5 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses
predicting Time 2 measures of functional health (IADLs)
from cumulative profiles of PWB, after controlling for edu-
cation, age, gender, and Time 1 IADLs. Cross-time incre-
ments functional health limitations were significantly
higher for those with stable lo compared to stable hi well-
being across all six dimensions of PWB (as well as for the
overall composite). In addition, for environmental mastery
and self-acceptance, those with stable mid-level well-being
also had significantly greater increments in functional limi-
tations compared to those with persistently high well-being.
For all scales of well-being except autonomy, those with
decreasing profiles of well-being also showed significantly
greater increments in functional health limitations com-
pared to those with stable hi well-being.
Interaction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo
well-being at different levels of education revealed signifi-
cant effects for environmental mastery and self-acceptance.
The effect for self-acceptance is illustrated in Figure 2(d)
and shows that among those with stable lo self-acceptance,
there is an educational gradient such that those with less
education show greater increments in IADLs across time
compared to those with higher educational standing.
However, among those with persistently high self-accept-
ance, educational status does little to differentiate cross-
time increments in functional impairment, thus illustrating
a protective influence among the less educated. The same
pattern was evident for environmental mastery.

Supplemental analyses
Because the above analyses reflect an unconventional
approach (both due to the emphasis on varieties of stability
and due to the use of a typology), two additional sets of
analyses were conducted to evaluate comparative utility
vis-à-vis typical analytic strategies. First, to examine
whether baseline levels of PWB have as much predictive
influence in predicting cross-time health as cumulative pro-
files of well-being, separate regression analyses were run
using the baseline well-being (separately for all six PWB
scales) as an independent variable entered at step 2, rather
than the categorical cross-time groups. Such analyses tested
whether varieties of stability constitute an advance over
what can be learned from using baseline levels of well-
being in predicting subsequent health change. In every
instance, the cross-time typology (i.e. cumulative profiles)
had more explanatory power than the baseline measures
(measured by change in R2 at step 2 when the trajectory set
or, alternatively, the baseline variable was entered); that
is ­ the cumulative well-being approach explained between
1.1 and 4.5 times more variance than baseline measures
alone. Specifically, of the 24 regression models run, over a
third (9 models) explained 2 to 3 times the variance as base-
line measures only, and nearly half (11 models) explained 3
to 4+ times the variance compared to baseline measures
only. Thus, cumulative assessments of well-being per-
formed notably better than baseline assessments in account-
ing for variance in changing health.
Second, another set of regression analyses tested the
alternative implied causal directionality--namely, where
baseline levels of health (four different indicators) predicted
cross-time changes in PWB (six different dimensions). In
the majority of these analyses (87%), the well-being typol-
ogy explained substantially more variance (ranging from 2
to 4+ times as much) in cross-time health than the reverse.
This result likely reflects the fact that self-reported health
showed greater cross-time variability, whereas PWB was
largely stable for the majority of respondents.
Finally, because the MIDUS study includes twin pairs
and siblings of the RDD sample members, assumptions of
independent observations are violated. To address whether
such familial dependencies biased the results, mixed effects
models with random intercepts for family clusters were
used to re-run the analyses. All conclusions drawn from the
mixed effects models were unchanged from those reported
above.
Discussion
The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether
cumulative profiles of PWB would predict better health,
measured with multiple indices over a 9- to 10-year period.
Most respondents showed stable profiles of well-being;
thus, the key question was whether those with persistently
high well-being would have better cross-time health com-
pared to those who had persistently low or moderate well-
being. The results provided robust support for this
hypothesis, net of sociodemographic factors (educational
status, age, and gender) known to be linked to both well-
being and health. Thus, for all outcomes (subjective health,
chronic conditions, symptoms, and functional impairment),
those with persistently high levels of autonomy, environ-
mental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with
others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance had better
unfolding health (after adjusting for baseline health) than
those with persistently low levels of well-being.
Furthermore, those with persistently high compared to
persistently moderate well-being had better health, albeit
for fewer outcomes. For environmental mastery and self-
acceptance, differences between persistently high versus
moderate well-being were significant for all health meas-
ures. For autonomy and personal growth, such effects were
evident in predicting fewer increments in health symptoms
across time, while for purpose in life, the same pattern
occurred in predicting better subjective health across time.
These effects underscore that the health advantages of
well-being are not restricted to extreme group contrasts
(high vs low), but also pertain to high versus moderate
contrasts, thereby underscoring gradient-like benefits to
experiencing PWB.
Although fewer adults showed change in well-being
across time, those with declining profiles had negative
health changes (increments in chronic conditions and func-
tional impairment, decrements in subjective health) com-
pared to adults with persistently high well-being. This
pattern was evident for all aspects of well-being except
autonomy. Similarly, for all aspects of well-being except
purpose in life, those with declining profiles had worse
health symptoms over time compared to those with stable
hi well-being. The overarching message was that mainte-
nance of high well-being translated to advantaged profiles
of health 9­10
years later, compared to those who chroni-
cally lacked well-being, or were declining on well-being
across time, or even those with only moderate levels of
well-being (effects less pervasive in this comparison).
Further analyses addressed whether persistently high
well-being was protective of better health among those who
are socioeconomically disadvantaged. This query extends
research on educational gradients in health (Adler et al.,
1994; Crimmins and Saito, 2001; Lantz et al., 1998) where
emerging evidence indicates that PWB may serve as a
buffer against the adverse health consequents of low educa-
tional attainment (Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Miller et al.,
2011; Morozink et al., 2010; Turiano et al., 2014). As pre-
dicted, interaction analyses showed that the typical educa-
tional gradient in subjective health was reduced among low
education adults with persistently high levels of autonomy,
environmental mastery, personal growth, and positive rela-
tions with others. Similarly, persistently high levels of
Ryff et al. 9
autonomy were protective against increments in chronic
conditions and health symptoms among less educated
adults, while persistently high environmental mastery was
protective against increments in health symptoms and func-
tional impairment among those with low educational stand-
ing. Finally, persistently high levels of self-acceptance
among the less educated protected against increments in
functional impairment. Thus, extensive interaction effects
provided support that persistently high well-being is espe-
cially protective of better health across time among the
educationally disadvantaged.
The overall pattern of results extends contrasts between
cumulative advantage and cumulative adversity that have
long been prominent in life course research (Alwin and
Wray, 2005; Dannefer, 2003). Merton (1968) once
described the compounding of strengths over time as the
Matthew effect, drawn from the biblical passage "unto
everyone that hath be given, and he shall have abundance."
Cumulative advantage has typically been applied to socio-
economic status, where the pluses of greater education and
income have been shown to translate to progressively
greater health disparities over time (Mirowsky and Ross,
2008; Ross and Wu, 1996). This investigation formulated
cumulative advantage differently--namely, in terms of
PWB, which was found to be largely stable over time.
Underscoring varieties of stability, some individuals
showed persistently high levels of autonomy, mastery,
self-acceptance, and so on, across time, while others
revealed persistently low, or moderate, levels of well-
being. Fewer respondents evidenced gains or losses in
their well-being over time. After controlling for baseline
levels in health, the central message was that unfolding
profiles of subjective health, chronic conditions, health
symptoms, and functional impairment were better among
those who enjoyed persistently high well-being across
time. Pushing the query further, interaction effects showed
the protective influence of persistently high well-being
among educationally disadvantaged individuals known to
have greater risk of subsequent health decline.
This investigation has several limitations. First, selec-
tive attrition is in the background of any longitudinal
investigation: those present at the second wave of MIDUS
were in better health and had higher educational standing
compared to their baseline counterparts who dropped out
(Radler and Ryff, 2010). This selection bias suggests that
results may have been stronger (particularly the interac-
tion analyses) had more disadvantaged individuals
remained in the longitudinal follow-up. Second, only two
time points were assessed, and they were common for
measuring both well-being and health. Although the 9- to
10-year lag constitutes a notable advance over short-term
efforts to link well-being to future health (e.g. Su et al.,
2014), the possibility that cross-time changes in health
could also be affecting unfolding profiles of well-being
cannot be fully ruled out. That said, the choice to use
cumulative well-being as a predictor of changing health
status was strengthened by the fact that well-being was
largely stable across time, while health status on average
was declining. In addition, comparative analyses clarified
that far more variance in outcomes was explained using
cumulative profiles of well-being to predict health than
using baseline health to predict subsequent changes in
well-being. Third, although cumulative indices of well-
being accounted for more variance in cross-time health
than baseline well-being, the variance accounted for after
adjusting for initial (Time 1) health status was limited.
Similar small effect sizes have been noted in other studies
where psychological characteristics (e.g. traits, positive
affect) have been used to predict major life outcomes,
such as socioeconomic standing (Roberts et al., 2007), as
well as morbidity and mortality (Chapman et al., 2010;
Chida and Steptoe, 2008; Pressman and Cohen, 2005).
The accompanying argument is that practical significance
may nonetheless be evident.
Practical significance may be particularly true for PWB
where mounting research documents that it is protective
against Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment
(Boyle et al., 2010a), functional cognitive decline in the
face of organic pathology in the brain (Boyle et al., 2012),
stroke (Kim et al., 2013b), myocardial infarction (Kim
et al., 2013a), and mortality (Boyle et al., 2009; Hill and
Turiano, 2014). Other work is explicating the neural cir-
cuitry, showing that those with higher well-being are slower
to evaluate negative stimuli and have reduced amygdala
activation (Van Reekum et al., 2007). Those with high pur-
pose in life have also shown better recovery profiles after
emotional provocation in the laboratory (Schaefer et al.,
2013), while overall well-being has been linked with sus-
tained activation of reward circuitry (e.g. ventral striatum)
when viewing positive stimuli as well as lower cortisol out-
put over 4days (Heller et al., 2013).
In light of the above evidence, an important question is
what can be done to enhance experiences of PWB for
greater segments of the population. The cross-time stability
in reported well-being may suggest a kind of fatalism
wherein some are blessed with high well-being over time,
and others not. This interpretation is challenged by clinical
applications and educational interventions that have grown
up around PWB (see Ryff (2014) for a review). Such work
documents that even among those who suffer from chronic
major depression or anxiety, recovery from emotional dis-
tress can be achieved and sustained over the long term by
promoting experiences of well-being (Fava et al., 1998,
2004, 2005; Ruini et al., 2009; Ruini and Fava, 2009; Ruini
and Ryff, in press). Thus, those with low well-being are not
inherently disadvantaged and doomed to a life of psycho-
logical ill-being with adverse physical health consequents
likely to follow. What longitudinal analyses of the sort
reported herein offer are strategies to identify those indi-
viduals most in need of such treatments.
