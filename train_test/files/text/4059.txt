Background
Violence against women is a significant public health issue
and a fundamental violation of human rights: It is estimated
to affect 30% of ever-partnered women worldwide, with a
slightly lower prevalence of 23.2% in high-income countries
(World Health Organization, 2012, 2013). Defined as
"behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physi-
cal, sexual or psychological harm, including acts of physical
aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and con-
trolling behaviours" (World Health Organization & London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2010, p. 11), inti-
mate partner violence (IPV) can occur in formal partner-
ships, such as marriage, as well as informal partnerships,
including dating relationships and unmarried sexual relation-
ships since the age of 15 (World Health Organization, 2013).
The data suggest that violence typically starts quite early in
female adolescents' relationships (Teenage Research
Unlimited for Liz Claiborne Inc. & National Teen Dating
Abuse Helpline, 2008), with an already high 29.4%
prevalence of IPV in young women aged 15 to 19 (World
Health Organization, 2013).
Although IPV may occur at any life stage, pregnancy is a
period of particular concern due to its effects on women's and
babies'health and well-being (Chambliss, 2008; Daoud etal.,
2012; Taillieu & Brownridge, 2010). Results from a meta-
analytic review showed that IPV is a widespread problem,
with 28.4% of pregnant women reporting emotional abuse,
13.8% physical abuse, and 8.0% sexual abuse (James, Brody,
& Hamilton, 2013). Estimates from a population study in
Canada show that 10.9% of mothers interviewed postpartum
for the Maternity Experience Survey (2006-2007) were

Resilience, Violence, and Early Pregnancy:
A Qualitative Study of the Processes
Used by Young Mothers to Overcome
Adversities
Sylvie Lévesque1 and Claire Chamberland2
Abstract
Giving birth at a young age and being a victim of intimate partner violence are adversities that affect the life course of
women. However, some young mothers overcome these adversities and cope well, showing a dynamic resilience pathway.
In this qualitative exploratory study, we examined a purposive sample of 10 resilient mothers who gave birth as adolescents
in a situation of intimate partner violence. Their stories were gathered from individual in-depth interviews and on-site
participatory observations. Data were collected and analyzed simultaneously, according to grounded theory. Inspired by
Masten and Monn's integrated framework of resilience, the resilience pathway of the participating mothers began with the
occurrence of the adversities addressed in this study, namely, early pregnancy combined with intimate partner violence. To
overcome these adversities, the participants deployed several protective processes: (a) establishing their maternal identity
and the creation of a bond with the child as a turning point, (b) taking an active stance to respond to victimization, and (c)
acting proactively and adjusting to motherhood. Promotive processes, positive adaptation indicators, and risks to positive
adaptation complete the proposed resilience pathway. The results lead to the conclusion that increased recognition of the
challenges that these young mothers face and greater emphasis on the importance of their social surroundings to support
these protective processes would support them in their transition to motherhood and promote their well-being and that of
their children.

abused by their intimate partner: 6% before pregnancy only,
1.4% during pregnancy only, 1% postpartum only, and 2.5%
during any combination of these times (Daoud etal., 2012).
Higher IPV rates during pregnancy are reported by young
mothers: In women aged 15 to 19 years, the prevalence of
abuse was 40.7%, decreasing with increasing maternal age
(Agence de santé publique du Canada, 2009; Daoud etal.,
2012). It is now well recognized that IPV during pregnancy
may produce serious adversities and numerous negative
health effects for both mothers and babies, including low
infant birth weight, higher prematurity rates, low maternal
weight gain, miscarriage, placental abruption, injuries, and
infections,amongothers(Chambliss,2008;Coker,Sanderson,
& Dong, 2004; Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano,
2002; Silverman, Decker, Reed, & Raj, 2006). Moreover, the
consequences of violence during pregnancy are not restricted
to a woman's physical health. There are also consequences
for her mental health, social environment, and life course.
Possible adverse mental health effects include depression,
stress, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sui-
cide attempts. In addition, due to IPV, some mothers may find
it more difficult to form an attachment to their child, or they
might experience breastfeeding problems (Campbell, Garcia-
Moreno, & Sharps, 2004; Chambliss, 2008; Krug etal., 2002;
Leone etal., 2010; Martin etal., 2006; Sarkar, 2008; World
Health Organization, 2013).
Early pregnancy, for its part, has been linked to a number
of social, educational, and economic consequences
(Lachance, Burrus, & Richmond Scott, 2012). Although the
results are inconsistent in terms of the nature and extent of
the consequences for women, there is general consensus that
becoming a parent at a young age can limit educational
attainment, increase the probability of being welfare-depen-
dent, and substantially lower personal and family income
later in life (Boden, Fergusson, & Horwood, 2008). Studies
show that many young mothers become isolated when they
experience violence, suffer depression, and have less contact
with their social networks (Kulkarni, 2009; Sussex &
Corcoran, 2005). Yet, some young mothers challenge the
assumptions of hardship, poverty, and limited parental
capacities that are often associated with this situation. They
use various protective mechanisms as well as coping and
adaptive strategies that are thought to contribute to
resilience.
For decades, scholars in various disciplines have used a
variety of theoretical perspectives to examine how some
people have managed to escape the harmful effects of severe
adversity, cope well, and bounce back or even thrive
(Garmezy, 1993; Masten, 2014; Rutter, 1987). In a broad
sense, resilience refers to "the capacity of a dynamic system
to adapt successfully to disturbances that threaten its func-
tion, viability, or development" (Masten, 2014, p. 10). As
theoretical models and evidence on resilience increased,
there were calls for context- and culture-dependent research
and theorization as well as more integrated frameworks
(Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000; Masten & Monn, 2015;
Ungar, 2004, 2007, 2011; Wexler, DiFluvio, & Burke, 2009).
Recently, Masten and Monn (2015) proposed an integrated
theoretical framework for child and family resilience. It con-
tains five core components that allow viewing resilience
from the perspective of contemporary developmental sys-
tems theory (Masten, 2014), which assumes that many sys-
tems interact or co-act to shape the course of development.
These components (Masten & Monn, 2015) are (a) defini-
tions of positive adaptation (for a person, a family, or any
other system) and the scalability of adaptive functioning
across system levels, (b) a clear description of the pathways
of adaptive function over time and their interplay, (c) the
identification of promotive processes for adaptive develop-
ment and the processes by which these effects spread across
systems, (d) the identification of various risks to positive
adaptation or development and of the processes by which
risk spreads across systems, and (e) the identification of pro-
tective processes that prevent or mitigate the adverse effects
of adversity and the identification of processes by which pro-
tective influences spread across systems.
Resilience in the Context of IPV and
Early Pregnancy
In the context of IPV and pregnancy, specific events, called
pivotal moments or turning points, may help women reject
violence in their intimate relationships. Examples of these
events are threats to their children's safety, changes in the
frequency or severity of violence, or improved access to nec-
essary resources (Bhandari, Bullock, Anderson, Danis, &
Sharps, 2011; Eisikovits, Buchbinder, & Mor, 1998;
Koepsell, Kernick, & Holt, 2006). Other factors are related
to women's decisions to end the relationship, the two most
consistent predictors being low-relationship commitment
and economic independence (Koepsell et
al., 2006).
According to Bach, Weinzimmer, and Bhandari's (2013)
study, pregnancy may increase women's self-esteem and
agency, which would help them end a relationship. This con-
curs with another study that found that pregnancy could
facilitate a woman's decision to leave a relationship if she
felt that her child was in danger. Furthermore, the fear of
being murdered and plans for the future can motivate women
to leave a relationship, even when her partner's manipulation
and coercion make it difficult (Moe, 2009).
Different resilience processes have emerged from studies
of combined pregnancy, violence, and young age. In her
study of urban low-income mothers-to-be, Lutz (2005)
developed a theory on double binding in these women. She
defines the processes that women undergo to bond with their
baby and navigate the relationship with their abusive partner.
The majority of the mothers she interviewed were hesitant to
report the violence they experienced for fear of public scru-
tiny and stigmatization. To maintain their public image, they
Lévesque and Chamberland 3
adopted different strategies that allowed them to present a
positive image of a pregnant woman in a healthy relation-
ship. Consequently, they were living "parallel lives" (Lutz,
2005). The interwoven and sometimes contradictory pro-
cesses that these women experienced were categorized into
five phases that ultimately ended in a decision to stay (or not)
in the abusive relationship (Lutz, 2005).
Bhandari's qualitative study in rural, low-income preg-
nant women demonstrates not only some of the negative con-
sequences of IPV on self-image, such as feelings of shame
and worthlessness, but also that IPV did not affect maternal
identity. However, the decision to leave an abusive partner to
protect an unborn fetus as well as other children contributed
positively to the representation of a good mother (Bhandari
et
al., 2011). A minority of women in Bhandari and col-
leagues' (2011) study pursued an abusive relationship, partly
due to their desire for their children to have a father figure.
Kulkarni's (2006) ethnographic study of 30 adolescent moth-
ers found that adult (mainly parental) guidance, material sup-
port, and a safe environment can help young mothers
maintain safety in a romantic relationship (Kulkarni, 2006).
Lutz, Kulkarni, and Bhandari's study indicates that end-
ing an abusive relationship during the perinatal period
requires a complex decision that is influenced by numerous
factors. They also highlight the dynamic nature of this deci-
sion process and situate it within a larger social and cultural
context. However, whereas risk factors such as physical and
social isolation, lack of access to resources, poverty, and
patriarchy, along with the consequences, have been well doc-
umented, a deeper understanding of how women cope in
these circumstances is needed (Bhandari etal., 2011). To bet-
ter examine the processes involved in coping with violence
during the perinatal period, the present study aimed to
explore resilience and IPV in early motherhood, defined as
occurring before the age of 20. A constructivist posture was
adopted, using qualitative research methods that included
individual interviews and on-site observations. Qualitative
research is a useful and appropriate way to derive explana-
tions from individually reported experiences (Willig, 2001).
It contributes to the knowledge by presenting qualitative
findings on resilience pathways, and more specifically, it
aims to answer the following question: How do women giv-
ing birth in a context of dual adversity, namely, young moth-
erhood and IPV, overcome these adversities? A better
understanding of resilience and coping with IPV during the
perinatal period would have implications for practices and
policies designed to support young mothers.
Method
Data Collection
Using an ethnographic perspective (Creswell, 1998), 10
French-speaking mothers living in the Montréal metropoli-
tan area (Canada) were interviewed individually in this
exploratory study. The participants (a) were older than 18
years at the time of the interview, (b) had given birth to their
first child before turning 20, (c) had been in a violent rela-
tionship, and (d) had a positive self-assessment of overcom-
ing adversity (e.g., they felt that their mental and physical
well-being was satisfactory, and they were comfortable in
their role as a mother). A semi-structured interview guide
was used, containing 16 open-ended questions covering
themes such as the participant's representation of her inti-
mate relationship, her pregnancy, the violence she had expe-
rienced, her coping skills, her social environment, her future
goals, and the advice she would give to someone else in her
situation. The guide could be adapted to the participant's
story. Changes were also made during the data collection
period to capture relevant aspects that emerged from the
interviews. The participants were encouraged to share as
much as possible about their background, situation, and
experiences. These data were complemented by on-site
observations (Beaud & Weber, 2003), whereby the researcher
participated in two community groups of young mothers (4
months with the first group, 5 months with the second; 2
days per week at each site) to identify the various sources of
adversity that these women had faced and to gain a better
understanding of their realities. The study sites were organi-
zations that provide services to either young parents or spe-
cifically to young mothers. The services included, but were
not limited to, counseling, support group meetings, educa-
tional activities on various topics, on-site babysitting, and
referrals to external organizations for specific needs. The
first author (S.L.) participated in the groups as a member,
using overt participant observation, and kept a daily logbook
of observations, comments, and questions following on-site
observations to help contextualize certain events and percep-
tions (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014).
Procedure
Participants were recruited via referrals by a counselor at the
community organization they were attending. The counsel-
ors acted as intermediaries between the researchers and par-
ticipants. They were responsible for informing eligible
mothers about the study and transferring their coordinates to
the research team if they were interested in participating. We
were not informed about potential participants who chose
not to participate in this study. This recruitment procedure,
which was specified by the ethics committee, had the advan-
tage of maintaining regular contact between the participants
and counselors, who were familiar with the various situa-
tions of the mothers in their organizations and had the clini-
cal expertise to identify mothers who were doing well. The
first author held individual telephone conversations with
potential participants prior to the interviews to explain the
study goals, describe the discussion topics, and confirm the
presence of IPV, measured by the Revised Conflict Tactics
Scale (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman,
4 SAGE Open
1996). Interviews were conducted at a location selected by
the participant, with options including the site of the partici-
pant's organization, home, or a restaurant near her home.
Interviews lasted from 45 to 90 min.All participants received
a monetary compensation of C$20, and child care was pro-
vided if needed. Verbal and written consent was obtained
before the interview. Participants'accounts were recorded on
audiotape with their permission, and pseudonyms were
assigned. This study was approved by the ethics committee
of the University of Montréal, Faculty of Medicine.
Data Analysis
The data analysis was based on grounded theory, which
enables inductive identification of social processes and tra-
jectories (Darvill, Skirton, & Farrand, 2010; Glaser &
Strauss, 1967). In accordance with grounded theory princi-
ples (Creswell, 2007; Glaser & Strauss, 1967), data were col-
lected and analyzed simultaneously. Thus, once an interview
was completed, it was transcribed and reviewed for accuracy
and completeness (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Data collection
from individual interviews ceased and saturation was consid-
ered achieved when themes were repeated and no new mate-
rial emerged from the interviews (Morse, 1995). First, the
transcripts were read (and re-read) for contextual meaning,
and the material was coded. Codes were created inductively
to reflect participants' experiences (Glaser & Strauss, 1967),
sorted by category, and examined in different contexts. As
more interviews were added, the initially developed provi-
sional thematic coding scheme was refined. The first author
performed all the coding, and a second author and a qualita-
tive expert reviewed a portion of the analyses for discrepan-
cies. Coding issues were resolved by negotiated consensus
and discussion (Bradley, Curry, & Devers, 2007). All analy-
ses were performed with NVivo. After preliminary analyses,
we consulted some of the participants about our findings in a
group meeting. They were invited to comment on whether
our interpretations accurately represented their pathways
(Miles etal., 2014). Their feedback proved helpful, as they
clarified some of the results of the preliminary analysis and
confirmed others.
Demographic Characteristics and Pregnancy
The participants had given birth to their first child at from age
15 to 19. For all but one participant, the romantic relationship
during the pregnancy was described as "important." For
many, the father of their child was their first boyfriend: They
had been dating from a few weeks to about 3 years before
they became pregnant. From their testimonies, it was appar-
ent that they had all been strongly committed to the relation-
ship with the father of their child. There was a range of family
histories across mothers, and many reported troublesome
events in their family sphere, such as violence between par-
ents, mental health problems, drug abuse, separation or
divorce, or frequent moving. Overall, their academic back-
grounds were similar: They had average grades and were
more or less invested or interested in school. The majority did
not want to pursue post-secondary education. When their
pregnancy was confirmed, very few participants had well-
defined educational or career aspirations. At the time of data
collection, participants were from 18 to 33 years old, with
eight aged from 18 to 24 years and two aged from 32 to 33
years. Six of the 10 mothers had left their abusive partner,
whereas four had chosen to pursue the relationship.
Circumstances surrounding the participants' pregnancies
varied from a total absence of contraception to a planned
pregnancy. At one extreme, Alizée was shocked by her preg-
nancy: "It was definitely not planned. We were immature; we
didn't use any protection. We knew the risk was there but we
didn't care I guess."At the other end of the spectrum, we find
Marie-Sophie, whose pregnancy was fully planned, as a way
to escape from parental authority and live with her
boyfriend:
For us, it was planned. Hum . . . we were going out together and
my mother decided to move to another city. It would have been
quite far. So, we decided that I would get pregnant and we would
live together.
Most of the participants fell somewhere between these two
extremes.
Results
Inspired by Masten and Monn's (2015) integrated frame-
work of resilience, the resilience pathway of the participating
mothers was represented schematically (Figure 1), based on
an analysis of their life course and their accounts. The path-
way begins with the occurrence of the adversities addressed
in this study, namely, early pregnancy combined with IPV.
This is followed by the deployment of protective processes
that enabled the participants to overcome these adversities.
These protective processes were (a) maternal identity and the
creation of a bond with the child as a turning point, (b) taking
an active stance to respond to victimization, and (c) proactiv-
ity and adjustment to motherhood. Promotive processes,
positive adaptation indicators, and risks to positive adapta-
tion complete the proposed resilience pathway.
Each component is discussed in detail below. A conscious
choice was made to avoid quantifying the data in terms of
frequency. However, in certain situations, the singularity of
some participants' trajectories is noted. All participants are
represented by pseudonyms.
Perceptions of Adversity
This study originally assumed that early pregnancy and IPV
would constitute two simultaneously occurring sources of
adversity. The results for early pregnancy show that
Lévesque and Chamberland 5
motherhood was central for these women, surpassing all
other aspects of their lives (professional, social, marital, per-
sonal). Furthermore, all participants agreed that IPV was a
source of adversity, even if they had difficulty identifying the
violent attitudes and actions associated with this term. Thus,
although the maternal role was perceived as a difficult
choice, it was assumed, and the IPV situation was viewed as
a situation from which they could hardly escape. However,
the majority of participants (n = 8) did not consider early
motherhood as a source of adversity in, and of, itself. For
some, it was simply the normal way of things, being the main
model in their social and family environment. For others, it
was a response to a lack of career plans or academic goals, as
it gave their life purpose. Pregnancy was also the result of
not knowing what lay ahead or an expression of a desire to
let life decide, as illustrated by Shany's comment:
At that time, I think it was really to give my life a certain
direction. It clearly was that. I've always loved children, but . . .
it really was the idea that at last, I would do something with my
life. It was selfish, just to get me anchored somewhere. You have
a child, you don't have a choice but to become a mother. In a way,
we are proud to be mothers. It really was to find myself. (Shany)
The participants pointed out that maternity is not easy and
that it requires a lot of learning, but they did not necessarily
link these challenges to age. For example, during the on-site
observations, they often talked about their child's develop-
ment, how it was within normal expectations for a growing
child. Many of them pointed out that their child was
following a regular psychosocial and physical development
trend, meaning that they were doing their job correctly as
mothers and were therefore not different from, or less com-
petent than, older mothers. The participants also stated that
what defines a good mother is not her age, but instead the
skills and attitudes she deploys when caring for her child. In
many informal discussions during the on-site observations,
the participants talked about the inadequate parenting skills
of older mothers that they knew. They also mentioned exam-
ples of young mothers with great parenting skills, the advan-
tages of being younger for bonding with children and
understanding them better, and so on. However, the two old-
est participants, with longer delays between giving birth and
being interviewed, presented early pregnancy as an adver-
sity. Their comments about the role that young age played in
their trajectory were more nuanced. For them, being a young
first-time mother increased their vulnerability and made it
more difficult for them to leave their abusive partner and take
on single motherhood. Without exception, all the participants
felt that their intimate relationship constituted a source of
adversity. Whether due to control, threats, fearful atmo-
sphere, repeated absences, or physical abuse, they consid-
ered their relationship to be adverse and linked to negative
impacts on their lives and their maternal identity.
Protective Processes
According to Masten and Monn (2015), protective processes
are factors that can be distinguished from promotive factors
by their special role in facilitating adaptation in situations of

adversity or crisis. Three main protective processes can be
drawn from the participants' accounts: (a) maternal identity
and the creation of a bond with the child as a turning point,
(b) taking an active stance to respond to victimization, and
(c) proactivity and adjustment to maternity. Maternal identity
consolidation and creation of a bond with the child occur
first, whereas the last two occur more or less simultaneously,
and not necessarily in a defined order. In this perspective,
identity and bonding can be regarded as a turning point in the
resilience pathway of young mothers who are victims of
violence.
Maternal identity and the creation of a bond with their
child. Pregnancy and childbirth changed the life trajectory of
the participants. Some tried to change their lifestyle and situ-
ation as soon as they knew they were pregnant. For others,
changes came when the baby arrived. Maternity brought an
awareness of the impact of all their actions and decisions on
another person's life. As one participant stated, "When your
baby arrives, I don't know, you feel more mature, more
responsible. You have someone to care for. You can't leave
him there and go to Timbuktu."
The interviews indicated that confirmation of pregnancy
planted the seeds for change and that the birth of the child
combined with the creation of a bond with that child consoli-
dated the desire to improve the situation. Whereas the time
required to create an affective bond with the baby differed
across participants, the analysis results showed that the
awareness of that special bond motivated them to mobilize
themselves, take on a positive parental role, and establish a
violence-free environment. The affective attachment to their
baby seemed to be based in part on their recognition of the
child's needs and of their own physical and emotional capac-
ities to meet those needs. As such, their maternal identity, in
the sense of the generated purpose and value, became central
to their self-representation.
Setting limits:Taking an active stance within an adverse relation-
ship. These resilient women were aware of the negative con-
sequences of their romantic relationship: They knew that
certain aspects could cause harm, to either themselves or
their child. Impelled by this awareness, they used strategies
that enabled them to meet their need for a safer environment
in which they could raise their child. Although not all of
them used the word "violent" to describe their relationship,
the descriptions were unambiguous:
So he tried to hit me but hit the wall besides me instead.
Afterwards, he took his steel cap boot and knocked my friend
over. He was . . . for him, there was nothing wrong in the way he
was behaving. . . . He didn't hit me afterwards, but you know the
signs were there. I was now dumb, couldn't do anything right,
didn't know how to take care of my baby, I was incapable of
cleaning the house . . . Suppers, they were never good. (Élizabeth)
However, the participants did not all react the same way
to their relational situation. The analyses revealed four types
of coping strategies: (a) defense strategies, (b) couples ther-
apy, (c) ultimatum linked to specific expectations, and (d)
ending the relationship. These strategies were neither mutu-
ally exclusive, nor were they necessarily implemented imme-
diately after the baby's birth. Concretely, some participants
(n = 3) developed defense strategies to reduce the harm
caused by their partner and the relationship. One participant
began therapy with her partner with the goal of developing a
more egalitarian, control-free relationship. Another gave her
partner a firm ultimatum regarding his attitudes and behav-
iors: If he changed, and those changes were maintained over
time, they would pursue the relationship. Most participants
(n = 6) chose to end the relationship:
It started like that; he called me names and put me down. Once
again, I froze and stayed inside for another whole month without
going out or calling anyone. . . . I talked about it with X
[counselor] and she was aware of the situation. She would come
to my place for visits. She came for 3 or 4 months. And one day,
I got up early in the morning, put all my belongings in a bag and
left. From one day to another. (Élizabeth)
All the participants' responses were characterized by major
hesitation before ending the relationship for good. Indeed,
the analyses revealed much back and forth, which can be
attributed to two main motivations. First, there was a shared
perception that early motherhood is judged more negatively
when the mother is a single parent. For a large portion of our
sample, the mother's and spouse's identities had to be com-
bined so that the early parenthood would have legitimacy
and credibility. They felt more respected as a young mother
when they were in a relationship with the child's father.
Therefore, many participants chose to maintain their rela-
tionship even if it was unsatisfactory or did not meet their
expectations. Similarly, most were strongly invested in the
two-parent family ideal. All participants had a strong desire
to form a united family, with the exception of one, who had
wanted the father absent from their lives from the very begin-
ning of her pregnancy. The second motivation for pursuing
the relationship was a desire to maintain a united family for
the sake of the child's well-being. Another common element
for many was the guilt they felt about their decision to split
up the family, which consequently deprived their child of his
or her father's daily presence. (For a more detailed descrip-
tion of the challenges that IPV imposes on early motherhood,
see Lévesque, 2015)
Because for me not having a father growing up, I so wanted my
daughter to have a father by her side. I really wanted him to play
the part, to be a dad. . . . In my head, it was always with the idea
that my two daughters would have their father. Mommy and
daddy in the same house. I tried until the end. Until the end, I
kept trying. (Shany)
Lévesque and Chamberland 7
I was more . . . cause I felt I had to be a family. In my family's
eyes, for my son. And for J, cause that's what he wanted. I just
did it for those reasons. (Louise)
Proactivity and adjustment to maternity.Incidentally, becom-
ing a mother brings many other major changes to a teenag-
er's life. One of the most significant may be the transition
from the "I rely on someone" to "someone relies on me" sta-
tus. When pregnancy was confirmed, the participants were
not financially, materially, or personally prepared for parent-
hood. However, the interview analysis shows that they mobi-
lized their external resources proactively and searched for
new ones to help them overcome obstacles that they might
encounter when they became mothers. As one participant
puts it,
You have a goal; you're going to find what you need to achieve
it. You can do it; you've taken the trouble to find the resources
you need. To accomplish your goal. But it's . . . going out and
finding the resources. (Mimi)
These resources varied across participants and could include
financial resources or material goods to prepare for the
baby's arrival, information and education about parenting,
housing information, referral or access to public or coopera-
tive housing or a more suitable apartment, educational and
professional counseling, and ways to break social isolation
and meet other new mothers. Family and social surroundings
were important resources for the participants. Even if their
family was not always supportive of the pregnancy at the
beginning, they provided much-needed help when the baby
arrived.
My mother helped me leave. She's the one who found the
apartment. If I hadn't found a landlord who helped me find
furniture in the first two weeks, and if I hadn't found a person at
the health center who was really concerned about my case, . . .
I'm not sure I would've been able to get through it all.
(Marie-Sophie)
This mobilization was driven by their desire to create a
life setting that was better suited for maternity. Furthermore,
the participants underscored the importance of establishing a
life situation that was better suited for maternity and of creat-
ing an enjoyable life for their child. When asked about their
motivations to make changes to their lives, the majority
talked about their child's well-being and taking responsibil-
ity for their children. As Shany puts it, "I want my daughters
to be at peace, happy, and fulfilled. It's the only thing that I
want. It's by showing them, by doing it myself. By being a
role model for them." To create that life setting, many par-
ticipants had to end relationships with family, friends, and
colleagues that they felt were toxic and had to create new
social networks with people who shared the same values or
lifestyle. Others had to end a habit that was unsuitable for
maternity, such as drug or alcohol consumption. Many also
had to establish a healthier lifestyle, for example, with a
more regular schedule. Creating these healthy life settings
required a capacity to discern what was adequate and what
was not. Their inner strength also helped them make choices
and stay committed to them. As one participant explained,
Me, I stood my ground until the end and got rid of the people
who were harmful for me. What good was it to have them around
me? . . . I think it's normal that you do some "cleaning-up" of the
people around you. Not keep all your friends. . . . All the people
who were doing drugs for the kick and doing it every day, I
flushed them out of my life. (Louise)
Promotive Processes
Promotive processes are factors and processes associated
with adaptive success, independent of risk or adversity expo-
sure, in that an interaction with risk is not necessary. Using
the past to go forward by (re)investing skills and knowledge
gained through previous experiences is a major process in the
resilience pathway of the participants. As shown in Table 1,
the participants had experienced many adversities before
giving birth to their child. To overcome these previous expe-
riences, they had to mobilize inner strength, draw on external
resources, and make changes to central aspects of their lives.
They gained strength by going through these processes, nota-
bly by acquiring knowledge and skills and reinvesting them
to cope with new adversities. For example, for Shany, the
various obstacles she encountered growing up gave her a
strong sense of self and an unwavering resolve. Alizée's life
experiences were more helpful than any school lessons:
using what she learned helped her avoid bad choices later on.
Because Marie-Sophie moved frequently as a child, she had
to deal with family instability: These experiences enabled
her to develop good adaptation skills. Meanwhile, Mimi
spoke about her strong character, which helped her cope with
"what others think." Elizabeth, who as a child was aban-
doned by her parents, had struggled for several years to make
a living for herself and her younger sister. She developed
autonomy, organization, and problem-solving skills, which
she identified as useful in her current situation. Faced with
the adversity of IPV, Elizabeth explained how she recalled
actions and events from her past to help her in times of doubt:
It was hard. Yes. At the apartment, I kept saying to myself: have
I done the right thing? I had a house, a backyard . . . But I had no
future because I was constantly controlled. It's not normal to
live like that and I wasn't happy either. When I was in doubt, I
would tell myself that it will go away with time. But I know that
I will overcome it, because I have been through it. . . . You know,
I have overcome obstacles worse than what I have to go through
today. (Élizabeth)
Another promotive process is the capacity to reflect on
and recognize the positive effects of change. An important

aspect that kept the participants on a resilience trajectory was
their capacity to reflect on the positive benefits and their
new-found feeling of control as consequences of the changes
they had made to their lives. This meant recognizing that
they had made appropriate decisions to stop abuse, that they
were gaining control over their own life (e.g., with an apart-
ment in their name), and that they were able to provide their
children with a stable and nurturing environment. These
were some of the major incentives that kept them going. The
opportunities to analyze what they went through, alone or
with a counselor, to reflect on their coping skills and strate-
gies, and to be aware that these actions had changed their life
course appeared to be essential factors in their resilience
pathway. Furthermore, recognizing that people around them
were aware and supportive of their choices and actions
appeared to be an important factor that kept the participants
on a positive track. Some of them were able to recognize
what they had done well, but for others, it was more difficult.
For these young women, recognition by a peer, or someone
else they valued, helped them become aware of the positive
benefits of a resilience trajectory.
When people around me told me, "I can't believe it. You are so
good. I would never have been able to do everything you are
doing. Thumbs up!" That, for me, was pride, but also a challenge
to tell me I have to keep going. That people see me progress and
go forward. I would also see it, but since I don't have a lot of
self-confidence, the fact that other people had trust in me
allowed me to go through that. (Marie-Sophie)
Seeing my family and my friends so proud of me helped me
keep doing things better, so I guess support from the outside
really helped doing good. Like once you are doing good, being
told you are doing good really helps, you know. (Alizée)
Thus, being able to identify their qualities, apply acquired
skills and knowledge to new situations, think about their sit-
uation, and view time as an important factor were all pro-
cesses that promoted a resilience trajectory. The sum and
interactions of these processes allowed these young mothers
improve their life trajectory.
Risks to Positive Adaptation
Although the participants' trajectories highlighted the pro-
cesses they used to overcome adversities, namely, pregnancy
at a young age combined with IPV, the fact remains that there
were other problems along the way. The participants were
aware of these limitations, which constituted risks to positive
adaptation. Two main risks were identified in their accounts.
Limited access to financial and material resources. The two pos-
sible income sources for our study sample, government ben-
efits and salary, are barely enough to live on. The end of the
month comes quickly, and tight budgets generate stress.
Housing accessibility, which depends on financial resources,
is another factor that can weaken a resilience trajectory in
many ways: by limiting the participants' autonomy, forcing
them to rely on their family, and sometimes forcing them to
stay in abusive relationships. Although some participants
were able to find cooperative or social housing, others had no
choice but to live in an apartment that was too small, badly
located, or unsuitable for their needs. They had to move fre-
quently from place to place to improve their housing situa-
tion, which created instability.
Work, school, and family balance. Most of the participants did
not want their children to be in full-time day care. They
wanted to spend as much time as possible with their children,
and they wanted to be there for them, at least until they
started school. For them, the "good mother" value, the idea
that a mother has to be present with her growing child, was
central to their role as a mother. Participants who wanted to
return to school or work outside the home wanted to have
access to flexible day care, either part-time or accommodat-
ing for atypical work hours. However, according to the par-
ticipants, the public day care system in Québec (Canada)
does not offer these services. They were therefore faced with
choosing to put their children in full-time day care or to stay
at home with their children and set aside school and work
plans.
Resilience Indicators
From the evaluation of the life trajectories of the participants
and discussions held with the referring counselors, five crite-
ria indicating positive adaptation to early motherhood in an
IPV context were identified (see Figure 2).
Presence of good parenting skills and concern for the child's
well-being.The counselors who contributed to this study
referred mothers who they considered resilient to participate
in the study. These participants had received previous sup-
port for parenting skills. In concrete terms, they had no his-
tory of intervention by the Department of Youth Protection.
The participants were also questioned about what they felt
constituted a good mother and on the ways in which they had
acted as good mothers. Besides the label "good mother," the
participants demonstrated concern about their child's well-
being, whether by attending workshops on parenting skills or
child development, or by their actions, attitudes, and interac-
tions with their child.
Apparent absence of mental health problems. In the interviews
with the participants and during the on-site observations, and
as confirmed by the referring counselors, the participants did
not present any signs of mental health problems. The major-
ity of them had gone through more difficult experiences in
the past, such as depression. However, these episodes
appeared to have ended at the time of the study. We con-
cluded that their current state of physical and mental health
Lévesque and Chamberland 11
enabled them to accomplish what they felt was important:
take care of their child, meet with other mothers, study or
work, and so on.
Cessation of behaviors judged incompatible with motherhood.As
mentioned above, a substantial proportion of the participants
reported previous behavior patterns that they judged to be
incompatible with motherhood. Therefore, they had decided
to stop these behaviors when they found out that they were
pregnant or after the baby arrived. The absence of these
behaviors would also indicate a resilience trajectory.
Awareness of the adverse relationship and its consequences.The
participants were aware that their relationship was not a posi-
tive element in their life. They knew that the behavior of
their intimate partner had repercussions for themselves and
their families. They were also aware that things could be dif-
ferent. This awareness of the relationship and its influence
served as both a preliminary activating step to counter the
violence within the relationship and an acknowledgment of
the adversity of the relationship and its consequences. It was
therefore considered an indicator of resilience.
Presence of plans for the future.The participants thought
about their future and were not apathetic in this respect. They
analyzed their situation and their options and made decisions
to achieve goals that they had set.
I tell myself all the time that social assistance might not always
be there. Me, my mother, she always had financial problems.
My parents separated when I was six years old. At that time, my
mother wasn't working; she was a stay-at-home mom. . . . I told
myself that I didn't want that, in my life. So, I had to go to
school. (Marie-Sophie)
These five indicators were identified by data triangulation
and analysis and allowed distinguishing between mothers
with and without a resilience trajectory. However, this dis-
tinction is fragile, due to the small sample size, the use of
inclusion criteria based on the mothers' and counselors'
judgment, and the absence of a control group for comparison
(i.e., presenting the two combined adversities), and it should
be interpreted with caution. It is also important to mention
that these indicators were not necessarily immutable for the
participants in this study. Instead, they should be considered
as observations within a specific context and at a specific
time in their life course.
Discussion
Based on the trajectories described by young mothers who par-
ticipated in interviews and on-site observations, this article pro-
poses an answer to the following question: How do resilient
women who give birth at a young age and experience IPV over-
come these adversities? The results of the qualitative analyses
highlighted certain protective and promotive processes by
which these women overcame these adversities. First, maternal
identity and the creation of a bond with the child provided a
turning point. Subsequently, they took an active stance to
respond to victimization, acted proactively to adjust to mother-
hood, and used the past to move forward by reinvesting skills
and knowledge they had gained from previous experiences.
Only a few studies have addressed this specific context of dual
adversity and the associated processes.The research has focused
more on only one source of adversity. Despite the growing
empirical data on protective and risk factors, little is known
about the processes involved in coping strategies and resilience
trajectories in an adversity context (Harrop, Addis, Elliot, &
Williams, 2009; Reaching IN . . . Reaching OUT, 2010). The
processes presented in this report advance the knowledge on
relationships between early pregnancy, IPV, and resilience.
According to our results, the creation of a bond with their
child is central to the lives of young mothers and constitutes
Figure 2. Indicators of positive adaptation in a context of early pregnancy and intimate partner violence.
12 SAGE Open
a significant turning point. Maternal identity is a positive
label that these women readily embraced. Our results are in
line with the literature on the transition to motherhood in a
challenging context, which postulates that the upcoming
arrival of a child is an important catalyst for change in many
pregnant women. For Charbonneau (2003), childbirth is an
event that singlehandedly produces changes in the mother's
habits and daily life, generating a resource mobilization pro-
cess that is distinct from those associated with other defini-
tive events in the teenage years and emerging adulthood. Our
results are also echoed in Bhandari and colleagues' (2011)
study, which concluded that the important life decisions
made by mothers depend on the mother's bond with their
unborn or newborn baby as well as their other children.
Regardless of the age at which maternity occurs, a notable
characteristic of mothers who showed resilience was the
development of an identity as a competent mother. Indeed,
central to the issue of maternal identity is the idea that young
mothers do not want to be labeled as "good mothers, consid-
ering their age." Instead, they wanted to show that they met
the criteria for a good mother, and they claimed their right to
be categorized as good mothers. This suggests that age is
inadequate and misleading as a normative criterion. Our
results are also similar to the findings of McDermott and
Graham (2005) and Mitchell and Green (2002), who found
that young mothers tried to distance themselves from the
idea that they were inadequate mothers because of their age,
mainly by creating a division between the young mothers
they judged as adequate or good and the ones they felt were
irresponsible and who did not care enough about their child.
Nevertheless, although this division allowed them to escape
the social stigma of early motherhood, this perspective con-
tributes to maintain prejudices against other young mothers.
Although they consistently recognized the negative
impact of their relationship with the baby's father, the par-
ticipants in this study mentioned a number of strategies they
used to respond to violent instances. These strategies were
intertwined with other simultaneously occurring processes:
proactivity, adjustment to maternity, and using the past to
move forward. They differed qualitatively from the adaptive
phases described by Lutz (2005). In the first phase, women
pursue their ideal of family unity and a positive image of
their partner, even if they experience IPV. In this phase, they
play down signs of IPV. In the second phase, they put up with
IPV for the sake of their child and to maintain the family
unit. In the third phase, ambivalence toward the relationship
with their partner increases: They oscillate between feelings
of despair about their situation and a desire for change as
well as better outcomes for themselves and their children.
The fourth phase begins when the two worlds, public and
private, are reconciled and the IPV is openly recognized. In
the final phase, after the baby's birth, the mother invests her
energy into protecting her newborn from the abusive partner.
A decision about the relationship has usually been reached
by this time: If the woman wants to end the relationship, she
makes appropriate plans. If she decides to pursue the rela-
tionship, she does so with conditions for the abusive partner
(Lutz, 2005). Lutz's (2005) results also demonstrated the
importance of the paternal figure, the father's presence being
a key element for the study participants. Hence, none of them
wanted to end their relationship during pregnancy, despite
violence on the part of their partner. On the contrary, they
reinvested in their intimate relationship, fuelled by the hope
that the baby's arrival would stop the violence (Lutz, 2005).
However, Kulkarni (2007) proposed a different interpreta-
tion of the transition to motherhood in a context of IPV. She
contends that when mothers are confronted with the multiple
emotional demands of a conflictual relationship at a time
where they are centered on the baby's care, the partner is
perceived as a burden.
Tidying things up by keeping unwanted people at a dis-
tance, creating a new circle of friends, inquiring about nur-
turing skills, and getting organized and equipped to welcome
the baby are examples of the strategies that our participants
used to create a more suitable life for maternity. This desire
and its various manifestations have been reported in the lit-
erature on the transition to parenthood. As one of the most
important transitions in the life course (Katz-Wise, Priess, &
Hyde, 2010), it tends to stimulate improvements in one's life
habits and the creation of a safer environment for an expected
baby (Klima, 2003; SmithBattle, 1995). This desire can be
more pronounced in women who practice unconventional
behaviors such as drug or alcohol abuse and in women with
early pregnancy. In terms of social norms for maternity, these
women are less often viewed as "good mothers" and are less
psychologically and financially prepared for the child's
arrival (Klima, 2003; Venne & Morissette, 2009).
Consequently, this transition period may provoke many of
them to make rapid changes to improve their life conditions
and life habits. For many adolescent mothers, pregnancy is a
profoundly transformative experience that requires signifi-
cant changes for them to become responsible parents
(SmithBattle, 1995). SmithBattle (1995), who interviewed
adolescent mothers during pregnancy and 4 years later, found
that those who perceived their pregnancy as a positive, trans-
formative experience blossomed into their parental role and
reported that motherhood allowed them to envision a future
filled with hope (SmithBattle, 1998).
The findings of this study must be considered in light of
certain limitations. We investigated a small group of resil-
ient women who had coped with specific types of adversity.
Thus, our results cannot be generalized to all young preg-
nant women or all those who experience IPV. Second, all
the participants in this study were referred by a counselor
working at a community organization. Therefore, young,
resilient mothers who had been victims of violence but
were not involved in community groups or receiving ser-
vices from a health clinic were not considered in this study.
Third, as imposed by the ethics committee, we were prohib-
ited from recruiting mothers younger than 18 years. This is
Lévesque and Chamberland 13
an important limitation, because very young mothers' tra-
jectories may differ significantly. In addition, retrospective
reports and time lag variations between events and inter-
views constitute additional limitations that could have
influenced the mother's self-reports.
Aside from these limitations, the results of this explor-
atory study raise intervention and research issues. The testi-
monies of the resilient young mothers demonstrate the
complex circumstances of early pregnancy when intimate
violence is also present, the many challenges involved, and
the processes required to cope with them. Resilience is rec-
ognized as an beneficial feature of health promotion (Raeburn
& Rootman, 2006), and this study provides a better under-
standing of the processes involved in the development of
resilience pathway, as well as factors that promote or hinder
its sustainability over time. Because these factors are subject
to change, better-adjusted practices and targeted public poli-
cies could foster resilience pathway in a greater number of
young mothers. Our results on young mothers' definitions of
adversity would also be useful for health and social service
professionals. Their perspectives could help practitioners
understand women's subjective experiences and create
spaces for dialogue, where common understandings of situa-
tions and intervention goals could be negotiated. Finally, this
study underscores the importance of taking into account the
positive elements in the lives of populations categorized as
"vulnerable," rather than targeting only risk factors or poten-
tially negative aspects. Further studies are needed to fully
explore the mechanisms of resilience and the associated cop-
ing processes in situations of early pregnancy and IPV.
Mixed-methods research designs would improve the under-
standing of these issues (Sandelowski, 2000), and more qual-
itative studies could provide deeper contextual analyses of
these dual adversities (Corbin & Straus, 2007).
