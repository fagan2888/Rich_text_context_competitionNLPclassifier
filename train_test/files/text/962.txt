ABSTRACT Recent progress in developing social indi-
cators is described in terms of six activities. In regard to
social bookkeeping, we are expanding the number of
domains covered by population surveys, and survey data
are being more widely disseminated. In social accounting,
demographic stock-flow schemes show promise of inte-
grating systems of social statistics. Social science theories
have provided models of achievement and other social
processes. Social forecasting is potentially an important
component of work on social indicators, but a new defini-
tion of the purpose of forecasting is needed. The practice
of social reporting is best exemplified in the work of recent
commissions. Social advising, while it draws upon social
indicators, involves functions that cannot be performed
by any system of indicators alone. The most worthy
aspiration of the social indicators movement would be
to contribute to the enlightenment of a changing society.
The current vogue of the term "social indicators" dates from
the publication of a book with that title by Raymond Bauer
and associates in 1966 (1). Institutionalization of the label
has been carried forward by its incorporation into the titles of
other, likewise influential books, by the general recognition of
an international "social indicators movement" evidenced by
such symptoms as conferences, symposia, foreign travel, and a
new journal, Social Indicators Research; by the establish-
ment in 1972 (under the auspices of the Social Science Re-
search Council and with the support of the National Science
Foundation) of a Center for the Coordination of Research on
Social Indicators; and, quite recently, by the appearance of an
official Federal statistical publication, Social Indicators, 1973
(2). (A second edition is promised for 1976.)
Among the many antecedents of the contemporary social
indicators movement, I mention only one: the monumental
Recent Social Trends, released by President Hoover's Re-
search Committee on Social Trends in 1933 (3). It was pre-
pared by a large group of collaborators under the research
direction of William F. Ogburn and set a standard for social
reporting that has yet to be matched by subsequent efforts.
This paper is a review of current and recent developments
that may, one hopes, eventuate a few years hence in work
that does surpass the achievement of Ogburn and his co-
workers.
One salient feature of the social indicators movement,
which is really implicit in its characterization as a social

movement, is that it is many things to many people. Not a
few social scientists and practitioners have simply seized
upon a popular label to justify or sanctify what they were al-
ready doing. Others have proposed innovations or departures
from present practice in regard to diverse matters, ranging
from the ways in which we collect data to our means of pro-
viding advice to lawgivers and political executives. I find it
useful to describe the scope of work on social indicators in
terms of how it relates to six distinguishable activities.
1. Social Bookkeeping. The creation of social statistics by
gathering information systematically and recording it; the
"bird watching," "weather reporting," or analogous function
which supplies the raw material for social indicators.
2. Social Accounting. The invention and application of
formal schemes of classification, aggregation, statistical de-
composition, component analysis, and the like, which serve as
standard frameworks for the interpretation of data and pro-
vide means of converting raw data into measures, indices, or
"readings" of social conditions and trends. An example is the
life table, an actuarial accounting scheme that renders inter-
pretable the basic data on numbers of people and numbers of
deaths generated by the bookkeeping activities of census and
vital statistics.
3. Social Science. The explanatory function, or develop-
ment of theories which find expression in models to elucidate
the movements of indicators and relationships among in-
dicators.
4. Social Forecasting. The preparation of systematic antic-
ipations of the future, carrying forward values of social in-
dicator magnitudes so as to be ready for what may happen, or
to forestall what might happen if evasive or preventive action
were not taken, or to realize the benefits of favorable de-
velopments that are seen to be possible if appropriate actions
are taken.
5. Social Reporting. The preparation of formal though not
necessarily official documents communicating. the results of
studying social indicators. Social reports might be periodic, as
is the Economic Report of the President, but thus far no
periodicity or even continuity of auspices for social reporting
has been established. There are, however, many special-pur-
pose and single-time social reports, such as the "Coleman
Report" on educational opportunity (4) and the "Moynihan
Report" on the Negro family (5). And we do have the ex-
ample of the prototypic Toward a Social Report (6), prepared
by staff of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
with the aid of an advisory board of social scientists.
6. Social Advising. The use of social indicators in attacking
problems of public policy. In the minds of many, including
Senator Walter F. Mondale-whose proposed legislation pro-
5096
Symposium: Developing Social Indicators 5097
vided for both social reporting and a Council of Social Advi-
sors, taking as a model the Council of Economic Advisors-
the natural vehicle for the development and use of social in-
dicators is an official body created by statute and serving at
a high level in the Executive Branch of the Federal govern-
ment. Pending such a development, should it occur, we must
recognize that much de facto social advising goes on already,
although in ways that are not well understood, with con-
sequences that are not easy to assess, and quite possibly with
little or no specific reference to social indicators as such.
The foregoing enumeration may serve in lieu of an explicit
definition of "social indicators." Clearly, we are talking about
quantitative descriptions of social conditions and trends
which are intended to inform public opinion and improve the
conduct of public affairs. Some writers emphasize the "social"
in social indicators, in the sense of "non-economic" or "trans-
economic"; their concern is to stress the need for kinds of in-
formation not included in the national income and product
accounts or in statistical series describing economic activity,
prices, production, and the like. Interestingly, stress on the
"non-economic" seems quite compatible with using the his-
tory of economic indicators to suggest a strategy for social in-
dicators development. Some also mention the need for direct
measures of human welfare as distinct from statistics that
merely describe the operations of agencies and organizations
that provide services or the amounts of economic resources
they use. Either of these emphases may be conjoined with the
declaration that social indicators are required by a society
that proposes to take seriously the "quality of life," as dis-
tinct from the mere augmentation of output implied by the
concept of "growth." The conviction that something im-
portant is missing from our conventional compendia of sta-
tistics-the statistical abstracts and yearbooks-is voiced by
practically all exponents of social indicators.
Social bookkeeping
The social indicators movement will have made a contribu-
tion even if it accomplishes no more than an acceleration in
the rate of development of the social bookkeeping function. A
convenient baseline for measuring recent progress is the 1962
report of the Behavioral Sciences Subpanel of the President's
Science Advisory Committee, Strengthening the Behavioral
Sciences (7). After noting that systematic collection of basic
behavioral data for the United States would assist both fun-
damental research and the application of scientific knowledge,
the panel suggested that:
The Social Science Research Council be invited to appoint
a standing committee to review and study present practices,
needs, and opportunities for gathering information about
noneconomic aspects of behavior in American society.
The Social Service Research Council (SSRC) Center for the
Coordination of Research on Social Indicators, established 10
years later, has actually devoted much of its effort to stimu-
lating improvements in "gathering information." One of its
initiatives, long overdue, is an attempt to persuade the major
survey and polling organizations to standardize their methods
of ascertaining the usual social background information col-
lected in surveys. Conferences of the parties concerned have
proved productive to the extent that agreement was reached
on a plan to prepare and distribute a manual of recommended
A second initiative of the Center is an experimental pro-
gram to facilitate the development of social indicators from
survey data archives. The Roper Public Opinion Research
Center has been commissioned to search its files for survey
questions that have been asked repeatedly. Once there is an
index of such questions, resources will be provided to selected
investigators so that they can retrieve the basic data and
carry out time series analyses.
These projects of the SSRC Center are convergent with
and supportive of several other steps taken in the last few
years to improve the supply of basic data.
(1) Dissemination, of census data in the unit-record form
began a decade or so ago. The breakthrough came with the
decision to issue a "one-in-a-thousand" sample data tape
from the 1960 Census of Population. Somewhat later, the
Bureau of the Census adopted a policy of duplicating data
tapes from the Current Population Survey for the use of
other agencies and private research workers. In such cases,
individual identifying information is removed, so as to pro-
tect confidentiality, and the costs of preparing the data for re-
lease in this form are borne by the project acquiring them.
The importance of this innovation can hardly be overesti-
mated. We have known for a long time that certain essential
social indicators are available in principle from the Federal
statistical system. Yet all too often efforts to put information
into an appropriate form are frustrated by the inadequacy of
the published summary tables for the purpose at hand. With
access to the unit records, the social scientist may specify in
detail how variables are to be manipulated so as to produce an
optimal estimate of the magnitude desired. To give one ex-
ample, because they had access to the data tape of a 1962
supplement to the Current Population Survey, Hauser and
Featherman (8) were able to produce estimates of the trend in
occupational mobility to 1970 that are more detailed, precise,
and reliable than any estimate that could have been assembled
from published sources.
Fortunately, several other Federal agencies are following
the lead of the Bureau of the Census. The social indicators
movement suddenly faces the problem of how to live sensibly
in a data-rich environment.
(2) There is growing appreciation of the fact that to create a
"system of social indicators"-whatever that might turn out
to be-will require many years of preparatory work. In the
meantime, the desirability of a continuous monitoring of
social change and the need for social reporting oblige us to
make the best use of existing social measurements. The po-
tential utility of data archives for trend studies, alluded to
above, is greatly amplified by a strategy of replicating base-
line measurements. Following the publication of a detailed
advocacy of this strategy (9), two major projects have dem-
onstrated the feasibility of this strategy and some of its bene-
fits. (i) A 1971 omnibus replication of parts of some eight
surveys done by the Detroit Area Study in the 1950's and
1960's provides indications of social change in selected as-
pects of marriage, sex roles, childrearing, social participation,
religious behavior and beliefs, values, political orientations,
and racial attitudes (10). Practically all of the 100 or more
specific items pertain to variables for which readings of
change hitherto were lacking. The argument is, therefore,
that many new and significant indicators can be developed
and quickly put to work, merely by taking advantage of our
question wordings and coding conventions.

stock of present measurements and regarding them as base-
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 71 (1974)
lines for measures of change. (ii) A second project taking the
argument seriously is the annual General Social Survey begun
by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) in 1972.
Most of the questions in this survey are drawn from past
surveys, so that only the retrieval of the old data from ex-
isting archives is needed to turn a cross-sectional study-as of
1972, 1973, or 1974-into an analysis of social change. Data
from the NORC General Survey are made available to the
research community at once, and at nominal cost. It is hoped
that wide dissemination will lead to a variety of uses and in-
sights. There is also an associated project under way to gen-
erate systematically the measures of change rendered possible
by the survey.
(3) The developments described thus far share the feature
of taking advantage of existing mechanisms and the stock of
information they have produced. But no one doubts the need
for new kinds of social data. To get some sense of the pace of
development it is instructive to study Social Indicators, 1973,
noting examples of statistics forthcoming from more or less
unconventional sources. I here classify as "conventional"
such major sources of Federal statistics as the decennial
censuses, vital statistics system, Current Population Survey,
National Health Interview Survey--although it, too, was a
novelty not so many years ago-health and education sta-
tistics compiled from administrative records, Uniform Crime
Reports, and employer records aggregated by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. "Unconventional" sources include both
non-Federal research organizations and Federal projects in
new domains. The examples include:
the Gallup Poll, for measures of confidence in ability to ob-
tain health care and fear of crime,
victimization surveys, begun by NORC and continued in
the National Crime Survey, sponsored by the Law En-
forcement Assistance Administration,
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an
elaborate series of measurements of educational achieve-
ment,
the Educational Testing Service "Growth Study," pro-
viding estimates of opportunity for college education by
scholastic ability and family socioeconomic status,
surveys of job satisfaction and subjective quality of life by
the Institute for Social Research (ISR),
survey of financial characteristics of consumers, including
wealth distributions, sponsored by the U.S. Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
time budget survey of the ISR, the U.S. portion of an
international comparative study,
surveys of expected future births in the Current Population
Survey (CPS), a continuation of series developed in stud-
ies by private research workers in 1955, 1960, 1965, and
1970,
survey of outdoor recreation, CPS supplement sponsored
by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation,
A. C. Nielsen Co. surveys of the use of television.
Social Indicators, 1973 did not include, though it might well
have done so, such series as:
ISR American Election Studies, for measures of political
participation since 1952,
CPS series of voter participation studies, biennial from 1964
through 1972,
ISR Index of Consumer Sentiment, several times a year
as of optimism in regard to strictly economic prospects),
Harris survey measurements of public confidence in various
institutions,
NORC series of surveys on white attitudes toward Negroes.
Now that the ice has been broken by the recognition in a
Federal statistical publication of such exotic sources as Gallup
and A. C. Nielsen, we should press for considerable expansion
of the social indicators publication, consistent with its mission,
into subjects not covered in the first edition. This will raise-
constructively, one would hope-issues of statistical standards
and standardization in non-Federal statistics, a topic discussed
elsewhere (11).
(4) Because the potential power of sample surveys to gen-
erate social indicators has only lately been fully appreciated,
there is a somewhat hazardous tendency to ignore other pos-
sibilities. Before the modern form of sample survey was in-
vented, a good deal could be said in Recent Social Trends
about "changing social attitudes," on the basis of statistical
analyses of the content of printed communications. Since then,
content analysis has become a recognized subdiscipline in its
own right. Its techniques have, in part, proved susceptible of
incorporation into computer programs. We are beginning to
see ambitious proposals for construction of social indicators
by means of content analysis of documents (12). Suggestive
examples of the possibilities of constructing rather long time
series are a study (13) of the extent and nature of press cov-
erage of blacks in Los Angeles, 1892-1968, and the description
of the trend of secularization in communications of a religious
group over the period 1890-1950 (14).
Social -accounting
If one thrust of the social indicators movement is the demand
for new kinds of data, another is the aspiration to provide
more rational and effective means of ordering and reducing the
data. Currently available collections of social statistics are
seen as lacking in conceptual systematization as well as com-
prehensiveness. There is no clear sense in which the several
items in a congeries of social statistics are cumulative. In
particular, they cannot be aggregated into some global mag-
nitude analogous to the Gross National Product, nor can they
readily be synthesized into composite indexes such as the
Consumer Price Index.
One reaction to this situation has been to identify as a first
order of business the construction of a comprehensive list of
categories of social indicators in order to control the analysis
and presentation of currently available data and to prescribe
the measurements that need to be created to fill the gaps.
The rationales offered for such lists of categories are varied.
One proposal is to ground the classification in a classification
of basic human needs. Another suggests that the kinds of data
to be compiled be selected in terms of relevance to an abstract
model of the structure and performance of the social system.
A third suggestion, which eschews any pretentious theoretical
justification, is to structure a system of social indicators in
terms of a consensually derived "list of social concerns." Such
a list actually constitutes the chapter outline of Social Indica-
tors, 1978. It differs in mostly uninteresting ways-except for
the signal omission of a chapter on "social opportunity and
participation" and the inclusion of one on population-from
the list proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development (OECD) (15) as being "common to
since 1952 (perhaps as much a measure of general morale
5098 Symposium: Duncan
most OECD countries."
Symposium: Developing Social Indicators 5099
An honest evaluation of the voluminous literature proposing
classificatory "models" for social indicators would have to be
that they are either sterile or stultifying. Most contributions
to this literature are de facto sterile-they are simply ignored.
But the greater disservice is done by schemes of "social con-
cerns" that prematurely foreclose alternatives, that imply a
specious consensus concerning values and goals, and that
threaten to divest the concept of social indicators of all its
benignly subversive connotations. What we are getting in the
official lists of "social concerns" is a roster of the topics on
which it is "safe" to issue statistics. If the "social concerns"
rationale is pursued to its logical terminus, we shall not expect
our social reports to contain much that is novel, newsworthy,
surprising, exciting, or controversial.
One may hope for a different kind of contribution to "social
accounting"-the development of formal analytical structures
to aid in discerning regularities in data and the significance
thereof. One example is Richard Stone's proposal for integrat-
ing systems of social statistics by means of a stock-flow ac-
counting scheme (16, 17). In principle, such a scheme can
accommodate most kinds of information on the states and
movements of members of a population. The formal apparatus
is a matrix framework and set of accounting identities from
which models based on outflow and inflow coefficients may be
developed. At the present stage of discussion, it is contem-
plated that a statistical system organized on this principle
would cover population and migration, education, manpower,
families, delinquency, health, and intergenerational mobility-
in short, most of the topics that turn up on the conventional
list of "social concerns." It is a little startling to realize that
principles of demographic accounting can be made to apply in
all these fields.
But it will be a long time before a system like that Stone
describes can be made fully operational. We will continue for
the foreseeable future to work with a miscellany of techniques
and accounting schemes. For what they are worth, the social
indicators movement has access to the various methods of time
series analysis developed in studies of economic fluctuations.
There is even the suggestion (18) that the formidable appara-
tus of spectral analysis be brought to bear upon the study of
social processes.
Of more immediate utility are the new methods for analyz-
ing multi-way contingency tables (19). These will be especially
serviceable in realizing the potential value of replicated base-
line studies. In most of these replications the samples are
small, so that efficient use of the data reliably to infer time
trends is of critical importance.
It could happen that the next important conceptual de-
velopment in social accounting will be an improved under-
standing of the problems of cohort analysis. We have recently
seen the cohort concept applied to studies of social change in
such domains as educational attainment, earnings, voting,
delinquency, epidemiology, migration, human development,
and various social attitudes, not to mention mortality and
fertility, the classical loci of cohort analysis. In most, though
not all, of these areas an improvement in our intuitive under-
standing of change does seem to result from making explicit
the role of the cohort as an intermediary in the process of
social transformation (20). What is only beginning to -be
recognized, however, is that robust understanding is gained by
means of cohort analysis only when it is supported by strong
identification problem (21), i.e., the problem of correctly al-
locating the observed variation in an indicator, classified by
age and time, into components corresponding to theoretical
effects of age, period, cohort, and their interactions. To realize
the promise of cohort analysis, we shall have to do much more
in each subject-matter domain to clarify the theoretical basis
for inferring cohort effects (or the absence thereof).
Social science
Virtually all writers agree that social indicators should be use-
ful in describing changing social conditions. Some also insist
that the descriptions have a normative component so that, in
addition to showing how things are changing, indicators will
disclose whether they are changing for the better or worse.
We now consider another stipulation, that social indicators
should have an explanatory or theoretical function. Land (22)
proposes to recognize as social indicators only those social
statistics that are components-variables or parameters-in a
quantitative social system model. Acceptance of this criterion
would lead us to recognize, with Land, that specification of
models of social processes and institutions and estimation of
their parameters are major problems to be solved in develop-
ing social indicators. However, such a definition of our task
might- not require a wholesale modification of the present
distribution of effort. The specification of models will surely
entail use of some formal accounting schemes; and estimation
of parameters (or empirical testing of models) will require
supplies of data produced by social bookkeeping routines. Of
course, we may modify our accounting schemes and our data
collection priorities in the light of the requirements of those
models that seem most attractive.
Both the descriptive and the normative uses of indicators
depend ultimately upon some framework of theoretical as-
sumptions. If these are only implicit in our interpretations of
indicators, there is little hope of improving those interpreta-
tions. If they are made explicit, we may be able to adjudicate
the claims of alternative interpretations. It makes a real dif-
ference, for example, whether a decline in fertility is a reflec-
tion of the spread of information about birth-control tech-
niques, or whether the main force behind it is a shift in repro-
ductive norms or ideals. If both the innovation and the ad-
justment approaches, as Carlsson (23) terms them, are ex-
pressed in terms of models, even fragmentary collections of
demographic indicators may suggest that one of the two ap-
proaches is to be preferred. Policy makers might then avoid
the mistake-if, as Carlsson suggests, it is a mistake-of
seeking to reduce the rate of population growth merely by
fostering diffusion of contraceptive knowledge.
Regardless of how high a priority we put on model con-
struction, it is too much to expect that any large part of the
social indicator domain will soon be covered by plausible
models. For the time being we can only allude to a few ex-
amples of models; and these are best seen as primitive begin-
nings rather than convincing illustrations of what models can
do for the development of social indicators.
Apart from the specialized field of formal demography-
models in which have been reviewed by Keyfitz (24)-per-
haps the most popular models in recent sociological investiga-
tions are structural equation systems depicting the process of
socioeconomic achievement as a function of social origins
(ascribed-status), ability, motivation, social influences, earlier
theoretically based assumptions that serve to resolve the
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 71 (1974)
achievement, and stochastic error ("lucky)). Coefficients in
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 71 (1974)
such models have been estimated for different birth cohorts,
permitting some conclusions about time trends in inequality
and opportunity (25). Summary figures from early work of
this kind appeared in Toward a Social Report. Thanks to re-
search carried out more recently, including the 1973 replica-
tion of the 1962 Survey of Occupational Changes in a Genera-
tion, the next social report could appeal to more sophisticated
versions of the achievement model and cite more voluminous
data in support of trend estimates. This field, incidentally, is
one where a great deal of lay, journalistic, political, and even
professional opinion is given the lie by the matching of a sub-
stantial body of reliable social facts to a reasonably cogent
model. It thus illustrates the value of social indicators as such
and also the role of models in constructing appropriate indica-
tors of such an intrinsically complicated idea as "opportunity"
(26). The achievement models are not, thus far, dynamic
models of social change. But they are of service in studying
change, in that comparisons over time or for successive cohorts
may be decomposed into variation in achievement attributable
to variation in exogenous variables and that due to structural
change, i.e., shifts in parameter values.
An interesting example of a more nearly dynamic model is
afforded by Mueller's work (27) on presidential popularity;
revised parameter estimates were obtained by Hibbs (28),
using generalized least squares to take account of time series
autocorrelation. The model yields surprising results, in that
effects of war and economic recession do not emerge as statis-
tically significant determinants of a president's popularity.
The social indicator here comprises 299 readings by the Gallup
Poll on the percentage of the public approving the way the
president is handling his job, covering the years from 1945
through January 1969. Perhaps this work will stimulate efforts
to construct indicators and models for that important but
elusive magnitude, level of general morale of the American
public.
Still a different kind of model is advanced in Hamblin,
Jacobsen, and Miller's A Mathematical Theory of Social
Change (29). On the empirical side they invest heavily in fitting
trend curves to a variety of time series, ranging from cigaret
consumption to airplane hijackings, from railroad passenger
miles to annual number of Ph.D.'s awarded. Attention is given
to a limited number of equation forms: power function, ex-
ponential, decaying exponential, and logistic. But these are
not regarded merely as mathematically convenient ways to
summarize trends. Instead, an attempt is made to derive from
behavioral axioms the functional form that will apply to a
series, once that series is classified as belonging to one of a
limited number of kinds of basic cumulative processes: social
adaptation (acquisition of expertise in collective efforts),
adoption of innovations, use of innovations, modification of
innovations, and socioeconomic development. This work is too
recent to have been widely reviewed by competent specialists.
But it is, at least, a serious attempt to supply basic theory
which explains the movements of some kinds of indicators.
Social forecasting
The tight symbiosis of economic indicators with economic
forecasts may represent an unrealistically high level of as-
piration for the social indicators movement. In any event, we
do not yet sense the demand for social forecasts as a stimulus
to the improvement of social indicators in the way that the
two endeavors have interacted in the economic realm. There is,
of course, a great vogue for something called "futures re-
search." Despite the participation of such scholars as Daniel
Bell and Bertrand de Jouvenel, futurism has made little con-
tact with the social indicators movement and has shown little
interest in the mundane problems of social indicator develop-
ment (30). It was not always so. The great pioneer of social
indicators, W. F. Ogburn, was much interested in forecasting
and saw it as a natural outgrowth of the effort to determine
the direction of social trends (31).
We do have as more or less continuous enterprises the prep-
aration of population projections and, based upon them, pro-
jections of marriages, households, school enrollment, educa-
tional attainment, labor force, occupational manpower, and
quantities derived from or used in obtaining these projections.
It is interesting that none of them, except for the age distribu-
tion of the population to 2000, was shown in Social Indicators,
1973; no reason was given for their omission, although it was
explicitly noted in the Introduction to the volume. One con-
jectures that this wealth of projections is seen primarily as
satisfying the routine needs of government agencies for as-
sumptions to use in planning service programs, budget re-
quests, and the like.
Quite a different concept was communicated by President
Nixon in mid-1969, when he announced the establishment of
his short-lived National Goals Research Staff (ref. 32, pp.
221-222). Its functions were to include:
forecasting future developments, and assessing the longer-range
consequences of present social trends,
measuring the probable future impact of alternative courses of
action, including measuring the degree to which change in
one area would be likely to affect another,
estimating the actual range of social choice-that is, what
alternative sets of goals might be attainable, in the light of
the availability of resources and possible rates of progress,
developing and monitoring social indicators that can reflect the
the present and future quality of American life, and the
direction and rate of its change....
The first and only report of the National Goals Research
Staff was quite disappointing in the light of expectations
raised by the President's statement. How its work might have
developed is better suggested by the report of the Commission
on Population Growth and the American Future. The Com-
mission took a fresh look at the way in which population pro-
jections are to be used. Instead of trying to calculate probable
upper and lower limits on future population size, it presented
population projections as the outcome of a hypothetical
choice of the nation between the 2-child and 3-child family:
"If families average two children in the future, growth rates
will slow, and the population will reach 300 million in the year
2015. At the 3-child rate, the population would reach 300
million in this century and 400 million in the year 2013" (ref.
33, p. 23). Much of the Commission's case rested on showing,
by means of other projections and less formal arguments, that
the consequences of the former would probably be preferable
to those of the latter demographic alternative, in terms of the
economy, impact on resources and environment, problems of
government, and social conditions.
Projections and forecasts, therefore, have uses other than
that of merely anticipating and foretelling what is likely to
occur. Indeed, an argument can be made that interpretation
of past trends is equivocal in the absence of assumptions about
what the future holds (34). In that event, forecasting had best
5100 Symposium: Duncan
Symposium: Developing Social Indicators 5101
be built into the structure of the social indicators system. We
may note, too, that a significant use of forecasts is to stimulate
efforts to improve models. Thus, while the record of population
projections, interpreted as forecasts, is disappointing, Keyfitz
observes that their repeated failures provided insights and
incentives for much of the progress in methods of demographic
analysis made in the last several decades (24).
Social reporting and advising
In many discussions, social indicators and social reporting are
bracketed, as if to suggest that the two are nearly synonymous.
But social indicator publications are not necessarily social re-
ports. SocialIndicators, 1973, for example, contains (bydesign)
little or no analysis, interpretation, evaluation, or recommen-
dations, except as some of these may be assumed to underlie
the selection of indicators and the form in which they are pre-
sented. Presumably a social report, by contrast, should feature
one or more of these components. Indeed, a practical test of a
proposed indicator is its suitability for inclusion in an analyti-
cal, interpretive, or policy-oriented social report.
We do not have much basis for anticipating what a social
report would look like if it were to be a Social Report of the
President prepared with the aid of his Council of Social Ad-
visors. Toward a Social Report was not relevant as a trial run
in this respect, since it did not simulate the situation in which
the Chief Executive is the nominal author of the document.
One can imagine that a President's Social Report would be
used to launch major policy initiatives, as the Economic
Report was used in launching the War on Poverty. It is
equally possible that in any given administration the Social
Report would be just one more routine document perfunctorily
assembled by a tired staff to comply with a legislated require-
ment.
It need not be assumed, however, that future social reports
will be written by (or, rather, on behalf of) the President. The
committee that produced Recent Social Trends foresaw the
possibility of a "National Advisory Council" that would
engage in a continuous consideration of "basic social prob-
lems." The suggestion was echoed, a third of a century later,
by the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and
Economic Progress, which suggested the formation of a
"national body of distinguished private citizens-concerned
with 'monitoring' social change, forecasting possible social
trends, and suggesting policy alternatives..." (ref. 35, p.
106). A body of this kind might well produce social reports to
the President (as well as to the nation). In that case, we might
guess that in regard to format and rhetoric, social reports
would resemble the reports of the several national and Pres-
idential commissions that have investigated various social
issues in the last few years, instead of being "social" versions
of the President's Economic Report.
One possibility to conjure with is that future social reports
will not even be printed documents or will not be released only
in that form. The Population Commission issued an official
film version of its report, which was viewed first on television
and then released for wide circulation. The film was successful,
to judge from the response of reviewers, in conveying some of
the Commission's more controversial conclusions and recom-
mendations. As a vehicle for communicating the import of
social indicators, it left a good deal to be desired. This is not
surprising. A review of the state of the art in "kinostatistics"
possibilities but also a great deal of uncertainty about how to
bridge the gap between the social science disciplines that pro-
duce the statistical content of a social report and the media
specialists who must express that content in audiovisual
displays.
Another connection which is often assumed is a linkage of
social reporting with social advising. Here, again, we should
recognize that the Council of Economic Advisors, charged to
aid in formulating economic policy as well as writing the
Economic Report, affords only one of several possible models
for social reporting and advising. We know from the example
of Recent Social Trends that a group can prepare an excellent
social report without having any advisory function and with-
out issuing pronouncements on specific policies. In any event,
it is now generally understood that formulating national goals,
enunciating social policies, designing programs, evaluating
their success, and allocating resources, all are functions that go
beyond social indicators and social reporting, however valua-
ble social indicators may be as aids to these functions (37).
Indeed, we must continually ask ourselves whether the
proper aspiration of the social indicators movement is to as-
sume the mantle of the philospher-king. Do we really want
most to create the best-managed society that knowledge can
design? Or would we prefer to serve as agents of enlightenment
for diverse societies that will perpetually be redefining their
own ends and continually transcending their definitions?
Whether we like it or not, the long-run effect of cultivating
social indicators-like that of acquiring any other knowledge
-is not calculable. We can only surmise that it may be pro-
found. Like the social science enterprise as a whole, social
indicators have the power to alter "our fundamental ideas
about human desires and human possibilities. When such
conceptions change, society changes" (ref. 7, p. 2).
