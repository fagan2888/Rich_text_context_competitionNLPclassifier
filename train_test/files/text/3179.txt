Intertemporal Effects 

of Fiscal Policy in an RBC Model* 

Summary
In the recent economic debate on the design of fiscal policy in Germany it is generally agreed
that the total hurden of taxes and levies has to be reduced. In this paper, arguments
that form the basis of this claim are evaluated within a calihrated Real Business Cycle
model. The analysis shows that reducing taxes and levies induces an increase in economic
activity as weB as positive welfare effects as long as government consumption has a low
enough weight in the utility function of the households. Within the model the decrease in
government receipts due to the reduction in taxes and levies is balanced by a redudion
in government consumption according to a fiscal closure rule which guarantees a stable
debt-to-output ratio.

1 Introduction
The recent economic debate on the design of fiscal policy in Germany Is characterised by
different views on the principles and the scope of efficient fiscal policy. However, it is largely
agreed that the burden of taxes and levies should be reduced. For instance, according to
last year's report of the Council of Experts for the Assessment of Overall Economic Trends,
which is well-known for advocating a supply-oriented economic policy, fiscal policy must
"... elaborate regulations on taxes and levies that do not reduce output and investment
incentives" (Sachverständigenrat (1997), item 10). This claim rests on arguments taken
from neoclassical theory, according to which relative prices distorted by taxes and levies
lead to a misallocation of the available resources: The intratemporal misallocation of time
induced in the context of individual labour-Ieisure choices results in an excessively low
level of employment, and the intertemporal misallocation of disposable income induced
in the context of individual consumption-investment decisions leads to exceedingly low
investment activity.l
Against the background of these arguments, this paper attempts to evaluate the in
tertemporal effects of a reduction in taxes and levies as requested of economic policy in
a calibrated Real Business Cycle (RBC) model incorporating a government sector.2 The
model refiects the basic features of the institutional framework of the German system of
taxes and levies, i.e. an income tax imposed to finance government consumption and trans
fer payments is supplemented by a consumption tax and levies on the wages the firms pay
to the households. The government budget is assumed to be intertemporally balanced by
issuing government bonds.
The model on which the analysis rests constitutes a synthesis of RBC models publis
hed in the last few years which cover a broad range of fiscal policy issues. Based on the
10n the analysis of fiscal policy in the neoclassical model of optimal growth by Cass (1965) and Ko
opmans (1965), see, for example, the papers by Becker (1985), Chamley (1986), Judd (1985, 1987) and,
in particular, Lucas (1990). Another approach using the model of overlapping generations by Diamond
(1965) focuses on the intergenerational redistribution effects of taxation and the design of the social se
curity system rather than on issues of allocative efficiency. See, in particular, the book by Auerbach &
Kotlikoff (1987).
2RBC models are quantitative dynamic general equilibrium models extending the stochastic neoclassical
model of optimal growth by BlOck & Mirman (1972). An overview of the development of RBC models,
which were first formulated in Kydland & Prescott (1982) and Long & Plosser (1983), can be found in the
book Frontiers 0/ Business Cycle Research edited by Cooley (1995).

papers of Barro (1981, 1989) and Aschauer (1988), for instance, Aiyagari, Christiano &
Eichenbaum (1992), Christiano & Eichenbaum (1992a) and Baxter & King (1993) study
the allocative effects of government consumption. Their studies rely on the assumption of
allocatively neutral financing through lump-sum taxes. The allocative distortions induced
by a taxation of factor income are analysed in Judd (1989), Greenwood & Huffman (1991),
Dotsey (1990), Dotsey & Mao (1994), Braun (1994), McGrattan (1991, 1994a) and Mc
Grattan, Rogerson & Wright (1997). Cooley & Hansen (1992) and Cooley (1993) study
the allocative effects of the introduction of a consumption tax, while levies on wages are
addressed in Jonsson & Klein (1996). Cooley & Hansen (1992) and Dotsey & Mao (1994)
introduce an intertemporal government budget ceiling, within which the government issues
bonds to cover its budgetary deficits.3
,4
Whereas Cooley & Hansen restrict the overall time path of government consumption
to ensure an intertemporally balanced government budget, this paper introduces a fiscal
reaction function which stabilises the government debt-to-output ratio by modelling a
feedback from the development of government debt to current government consumption.
In a simple way, this modelling addresses the fact that revenue shortfalls caused by a
reduction in taxes and levies have to be compensated for by spending cuts in order to
guarantee the sustainability of the government budget.
The paper is organised as folIows. Section 2 describes the RBC model incorporating
the government sector, taking into account the German system of taxes and levies. First
ly, optimal economic plans are derived for the model's economic agents, i.e. households
and firms. The way they interact is determined by both the institutional structure of the
markets and the government's fiscal policy. Secondly, this section demonstrates how the
optimal economic plans are coordinated by market prices supporting a competitive equi
librium. In Section 3, the model is calibrated with the aim of reproducing some stylised
facts of the German goods and labour markets which are summarised by simple statistics.
By means of a sensitivity analysis, these stylised facts are compared with the correspon

netary poliey: For instanee, extensions covering foreign trade are studied by Baekus, Kehoe &; Kydland

ding figures implied by the calibrated model. The model is subsequently used to simulate
and to quantify the welfare effects of various fiscal policy measures designed to reduce the
burden of taxes and levies as requested of economic policy. Section 4 gives. a summary of
the findings and draws some conclusions. The Appendix explains how the data used for
the calibration of the model were obtained.
Description of the Model Economy
The. model economy consists of a large number of identical households and identical firms
which act competitively in the economy's markets, i.e. the (real) capital market, the labour
market, the government bond market and the goods market, at the beginning of the periods
t = 0,1, ...:
H The households rent their capital stock in the capital market and supply labour
in the labour market. They buy a homogenous good in the goods market,
which they use for consumption or for investment in capital. In addition, they
purchase bonds issued by the government in the bond market.
F The firms sell a homogenous good in the goods market, which they produce by
using the capital borrowed in the capital market and the labour obtained in the
labour market.
The economic activity of the households and firms is affected by the government's fiscal
policy:
G In the goods market, the government purchases the homogenous good supplied
by the firms, it makes transfer payments to the households, and it finances its
spending through taxes and levies and the issuance of government bonds.
The government's fiscal policy is considered to be exogenous for the households and
firms. The volume of the bonds issued by the government depends on the fiscal balance of
the government budget.
The supply and demand decisions of the households and firms in the factor markets and
the goods market are coordinated by the relevant market prices of period t via a Walrasian
mechanism. Furthermore, the endogenous pricing of the government bonds guarantees
3 

that the volume of bonds issued by the government matches the households' demand for
government bonds.
Since only the relative prices are determined in the real economy being considered here,
the homogenous good is chosen as the numeraire. The supply and demand decisions in the
factor markets and the goods market are then coordinated by the real factor prices, i.e. the
prices for renting capital and labour expressed in units of the homogenous good. Assuming
perfect competition in the markets, these prices constitute an exogenous determinant for
the households and firms.
In the following subsections, the activities of the government, the households and the
firms - as described under G, H and F are analysed in more detail. Subsequently, the
competitive equilibrium suitable for the coordination of these activities is defined.
2.1 The Government
At the beginning of the periods t =0,1, ... the government purchases the amount Ge of
the homogenous good Qt offered by the firms in the goods market, and it makes transfer
payments to the amount of TRt
to the households. The government uses the purchased
goods for purely consumptive purposes.5
To finance its expenditure the government imposes:
(a) a tax of t~ on the households' consumption Ch
(b) a tax of
tt on the households' factor income Tt Kt +tOt Nt minus the capital depre
ciation 0 Kt with 0 < 0 ~ 1, where Tt denotes the rental rate for the capital stock K t
and Wt the wage rate for the labour input Nt, and
(c) a levy of 2t:u on the wages the firms pay to the households Wt Nt; the households and
the firms each pay for half of this levy.
The wage levy can be interpreted as a contribution to an implicit social security system
which makes transfer payments to the households. The gross wage rate relevant to the
firms - including the wage levies they have to pay - is Wt
=(1 +t:u) tOt.
SOn models which take aceount of government investment, see Ambler & Paquet (1994) and Baxter &
King (1993).
4
The government budget, comprising government expenditure and revenue, is balanced
by issuing an amount EHl of government bonds with a single-period maturity and an
effective return of Rt . The equation for the government budget then reads
Gt +TRt +Et =
t~
Ct +
t~
[(rt - 8)]{t + 1 : tr Wt Nt
1
2t'f W N EHl (1)
+ 1 +tr t t + 1 +Rt .
The discounted government bonds Et
+d(l + Rt ) are to be interpreted as a risk-free
payment promise indicating that the government will transfer EHl worth of resources to
the households in the next period.
Since a positive effective return leads to a continuous accumulation of government debt,
the budget equation for the given amount of receipts proves to be dynamically unstable
unless government spending is adequately restricted. In other words, the unrestricted
government budget is not sustainable in the long run.
To guarantee a sustainable budget, we will now introduce a fiscal reaction function
which models a stabilising feedback from the development of government debt to gover
nment consumption Gt , whose autonomous component is assumed to depend linearly on
the output Qt via the consumption rate 9t. In particular, the reaction function is specified
in such a manner that deviations from a lastingly balanced debt-to-output ratio (B/ Q)
lead to a reduction in or expansion of government consumption,
(2)
Setting the parameter 'lj; at a sufficiently high value will then ensure the stability of the
equation for the government budget.
Since the government transfers TRt do not play an essential fiscal role in the model
economy and as the assumption of identical households renders redistribution issues irre
levant, for the sake of convenience it is assumed that the transfers linearly depend on the
output Qt via the transfer rate trt,
(3)
Owing to the linearity of the government budget equation in the aggregates Ch
]{t, Nt,
Et, Et+l , Gt, TRt - and due to equations (2) and (3) also in Qt - these variables can
5 

be seen as per-capita variables. Such per--capita variables will turn out to be extremely
useful in the definition of the economy's competitive equilibrium given below.
=

The vector of the exogenous fiscal policy variables Vt (gt, t~, tt, t';:, trt)', i.e. of the
autonomous government consumption rate, the rates of taxes and levies and the transfer
rate, is assumed to follow a stationary vector-autoregressive process with independent
standard-normally distributed innovations fv,t+l,
(4)
In the calibration of the model the autoregressive transition equation of the fiscal policy
variables will be fitted to fiscal data. In this connection, it is assumed that the modulus
of the eigenvalues of the transition matrix Av lies within the unit circle. In addition, the
matrix Cf" is defined to be lower triangular. The conditional covariance matrix of VtH is
Var[VtHIVt] = Cf" C:".
Given the above specifications, the government sector is fully characterised by the
equation for the government budget (1), the government consumption according to (2),
the transfers described in (3) and the autoregressive transition equation of the vector of
fiscal policy variables (4).
2.2 The Households
At the beginning of each period t = 0,1, ... the households decide on how to use their
available resources during this period. This choice is made in the context of an intertem
poral decision problem under uncertainty. They decide on:
H.I the allocation of their disposable income in period t, and
H.2 the allocation of their available time in period t.
The system of necessary conditions for this decision problem yields conditional decision
functions which determine the households' supply and demand behaviour in the economy's
factor markets, the goods market and the government bond market.
Assuming perfect competition in these markets, the decisions of the individual house
holds do not affect the per--capita variables. In order to distinguish the individual house
holds' variables from the per--capita variables, which is of vital importance for calculating
the model economy's competitive equilibrium, the households' variables will subsequently
be specified in smal11etters.
6
2.2.1 The Decision Problem
In period t the households receive capital and wage income. The capital income is determi
ned by the capital stock kt , which the households lend to the fiTms in the c,apital market for
a fee amounting to the rental rate for capital utilisation rt. The households' wage income
depends on the amount of labour nt which they offer in the labour market and which the
firms hire at a wage rate of (1 +t;V)-lWt. In addition, the households receive government
transfer payments totalling TRt and redeem an amount bt
of government bonds purchased
in the previous period.
After deducting the capital depreciation 6 kt , an income tax t1 must be paid on the
income received. The income tax imposed on the households' capital income amounts to
tt (rt - 6) kt, and the income tax on the wage income is tf (1 +t;V)-lWt nt. In addition, a
wage levy rate t;V is applied to the households according to which they pay the amount of
t;V (1 +t;V)-l Wt nt of their wage income to the government.
The households use the disposable income left after deducting income tax and wage
levies to buy the homogenous good the firms offer in the goods market. Furthermore, the
households purchase the newly issued government bonds bt+l discounted with areturn of
1 +Rt . The homogenous good is alternatively used for consumption Ct and investment it .
A consumption tax is imposed on their consumption Ct to the amount of the consumption
tax rate tf. The budget equation of the households then reads
C) . bt+1
(1 +tt Ct +Zt + R
1 + t
(5)
Given proportional depreciation 6 kt , the investment it increases the households' capital
stock in line with the capital updating equation
kt+1 = (1 - 6) kt
+it , 0 < 6 ~ 1. (6)
Given the fixed initial capital stock ko, the current capital stock kt is the result of the
past investment decisions {ir}~::~. We shall assurne that all households have the same
initial capital stock ko as well as the same initial stock of government bonds bo.
As regards the labour they offer, the households must consider that their labour supply
is limited by their total available time. If that time is normalised to unity and if lt denotes
7 

leisure, i.e. the households' available time after deducting the time offered in the labour
market, then
(7)
Since the investment chosen in the context of the allocation problem H.l at the begin
ning of period t affects the capital stock via the capital updating equation (6) and hence
the income and consumption opportunities in the future periods T = t +1, t +2, ..., the
households base their decisions on the intertemporal maximisation of their welfare.
The households' preferences regarding the sequence of current and future private and
government consumption {c,., G'r }~t and the sequence of current and future leisure
{ l
T
}~t are captured in a (lifetime) utility function, which is additively separable in time,
Yt( { c,., Gn l'r }~t)
=E
00
ß'r-tU(c,. +11" G'r' l'r)' 0 < ß < 1.
'r=t
The parameter ß is a discount factor and the aggregation parameter 11" ;::: 0 determines
the extent to which government consumption G'r - in the sense of a public good - brings
benefits to the households.6 If 11"
= 1, the households consider government consumption
G'r as a perfect substitute for private consumption c,..
The (single-period) utility function
has the properties well-known from consumer theory. This means in particular that U is
twice continuously differentiable, and both Ue
> 0, Ul > 0 and Uce < 0, Ull < O.
When formulating the intertemporal decision problem, one has to take into account
that, at the beginning of period t, the households know the current factor prices Tt,
Wt, the current return Rt and the current values of the fiscal policy variables t~, tt,
t~, Gt, TRt · But there is uncertainty about the sequence of the future factor prices
{Tn W T
}~t+I' the future returns {~}~t+l and the future values of the fiscal policy
variables {t~, t~, t~, G'r' T~ }~t+I' At the beginning of period t the households therefore
choose a feasible allocation plan {c,., i'r' b'r+h l'r' n'r }~t which maximises the expected value
of their discounted (lifetime) utility:

(1992) and Christiano &: Eichenbaum (1992a).

given the stock of government bonds bt and the capital stock kt .
The expectation Etl·] == E[ ·1 nd is formed rationally, i.e. consistent with the model's
structure, conditional on the information set n
t
available at the beginning of period t with
{rt, Wt, Rt , t~, tt, tf, Gt , TRt} c nt . The assumption of rational expectations implies that
the households are aware of the determination of the future factor prices rr, Wr , the future
returns Rr and the future fiscal policy variables t~, t~, t:;!, Gn
TRr .
2.2.2 The Conditional Decision Functions
The decision problem (8) - (11) can be solved by using a dynamic generalisation of the
Lagrange method.7 The Lagrangean to be maximised is
(12) 

Et [
~
ßr-t { U(Cr +11' Gr, Ir) - ß '\1,r+1 ( (1 +t~)
Cr +ir +br+d(1 +Rr)
- (1 - t~)( rr kr + (1 +t:::t1Wr nr ) - t~ 8 kr +t::: (1 +t:::t1Wr nr - TRr - br )
- ß '\2,r+d kr+1 - (1 - 8) kr ir ) - J.lr (1r +nr - 1)}] ,
where the Lagrange multipliers '\l,r+1, '\2,r+1 and J.lr denote, respectively, the shadow
prices of a marginal unit of discounted government bonds, the capital stock and leisure,
each expressed in utility units.
7For details on how the Lagrange method is used to solve (recursive) intertemporal decision problems
under uncertainty, see King, Plosser & Rebelo (1988a, 1988b), Plosser (1989), McCallum (1989) and Chow
(1992, 1993).
9
The system of first-order necessary conditions for a maximum of the Lagrangean (12)
is obtained by setting the partial first derivatives equal to zero:
(i) The derivatives with respect to c,., in b""+b I..,. and n..,. for T = t, t + 1, ... yield the
conditions
Et[Uc( c,. +11" Gn
I..,.)] - ßEt[(l + t~) Al,1"+I]' (13)

Et
[Al...,.+1] - Et
[A2...,.+1], (14)

Et
[Al,..,.+l/(l + Rr)] - ßEt[AI,..,.+2], (15) 

Et[U,(c,. +1I"G..,.,I..,.)] - E,["..,.], (16)

ßEt[(l - t~ - t~) (1 + t~rl w..,. Al,""+1] Et ["..,.].
(17) 

(ii) The derivative with respect to k..,. for T
= t + 1, t + 2, ... yields a transition equation
for the expected shadow price of capital
(iii) The derivatives with respect to Al...,.+b A2,,.+1 and "..,. for T = t, t + 1, ... yield a
transition equation for the expected stock of government bonds
Et
[(l + t~) c,.] + Et[i..,.] + Et[b..,.+t!(l + Rr)] = Et[(1 - t~) (r..,. k..,.
+(1 + t~rlw..,. n..,. )] + Et[t~ c5 k..,.] - Et[t~ (1 + t~rlw..,. n..,.] + Et[TRr] + Et[b..,.],
a transition equation for the expected capital stock
and the condition
The sequence of the first-order necessary conditions (13) - (17) implies that neither the
intertemporal reallocation of a marginal unit of income nor the intratemporal reallocation
of a marginal unit of time can increase the expected discounted (lifetime) utility of the
households at any point along the optimal allocation path.
The system of necessary conditions is completed by the transversality conditions
10
and
which imply that the discounted expected values of government bonds and capital in period
T
+1 - having been converted into utility units by means of their shadow prices - will
disappear for T -+ 00.
Since the uncertainty regarding the factor prices rHl, WHl, the return RH1 and the
fiscal policy variables t~+l' tt+l' tf+l' GH1 , TRH1 vanishes during the transition from peri
od t to period t +1 - which hence yields {rHl' WH!, Rt+1, t~+l' tt+l' tf+l' GH1 , TRH1 } C
Dt+1 with Dt+1 ::) Dt -, the households do, in fact, implement the planned alloca
tion {Ct, it, bH 1, Zt, nt} during period t. However, at the beginning of period t + 1,
they re-optimise the sequence of allocations planned for the rest of their lifetime
{cT,iT, bT+1, ZT' nT}~=t+l based on the more comprehensive amount of information DH1
available by then. Owing to the reoptimisation by the households, solving the intertem
poral decision problem (8) - (11) can be restricted to determining the optimal allocation
in period t, i.e. to determining {ct,it,bH1,Zt,nd, which, however, depends in a forward
looking manner on the expectations about the future values of the factor prices, the return
and the fiscal policy variables due to the necessary conditions (15) and (18).
Conditional on the available information Dt, the households' optimal allocation {Ct,
bt+1,it, Zt, nt} is characterised by time-invariant conditional decision functions given their
stock of government bonds bt and their capital stock kt . After having substituted the
Lagrange multiplier /1-t and subject to the identity At+llt - Et[Al,Hd =Et[A2,tHl resulting
from condition (14) the following characterisation is obtained:
H.l The optimal allocation of the disposable income in period t is determined by
a consumption function, an investment function and a demand function for
government bonds
c(rt, Wt, Rt, At+llt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt), (19)
Zt i(rt, Wt, Rt, AHllt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt), (20)
b(rt, Wt, Rt, At+llt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt). (21 )
H.2 The optimal allocation of the available time in period t is determined by a
leisure demand function and a labour supply function
(22)
11
(23)
Beeause of the binding budget and time eonstraints (5), (7) it will suffiee to consider the
consumption function (19), the investment function (20) and the labour supply funetion
(23) as the solution to the allocation problems H.1 and H.2. The derivation of this solution
eompletes the description of the household sector. The following subsection will foeus on
the deseription of the firms' behaviour.
2.3 The Firms
Whereas the households make intertemporal decisions under uneertainty, the firms' deci
sions are based on static observation and certainty. This simplification is based on the
assumption that the firms can obtain the production factors for each single period in the
factor markets. Such modelling greatly simplifies the determination of a competitive equi
librium in which the households' intertemporal decisions and the firms' static decisions are
to be coordinated. We will begin with a description of the firms' production teehnology,
followed by a derivation of the conditional factor demand functions which characterise the
firms' supply and demand behaviour in the economy's goods and factor markets.
2.3.1 The Production Problem
Using the production factors of capital Kt and labour Nt, the firms produce a homogenous
good in the periods t =0,1, ... according to a linear-homogenous neoclassical production
function
The production function F has the properties well-known from the theory of the firm.
In particular, F is twice continuously differentiable, and FK > 0, FN > 0 and FKK < 0,
FNN < 0, FKN = FNK > O.
Owing to the linear homogeneity of the production function, and assuming there is
perfect competition in the factor and the goods markets, the firms' production problem
can be formulated by using per-capita variables, which means that firm-specific variables
do not need to be introduced.
12
In addition to the production factors [(t, Nt, the amount of output Qt depends multi
plicatively on a stochastic technology variable Zt,
(24)
which reflects the model economy's level of technology in period t.B
The technology variable Zt is assumed to follow a stationary autoregressive process with
independent standard-normally distributed innovations fz,t+I,
IPzl < 1, u~z > 0, (25)
2
where the conditional variance ofthe technology variable turns out to be Var[Zt+I IZtl U cz '
Assuming that the fiTms are aware of the factor prices rt, Wt and the realisation of the
technology variable Zt at the beginning of period t, they will choose a feasible production
plan {Qt, [(t, Nt} which is designed to maximise their current profits:
(26)
subject to constraint (24).
2.3.2 The Conditional Factor Demand Functions
The profit maximisation problem (26), (24) is solved with the Lagrange method. The
Lagrangean to be maximised is
(27)
where the Lagrange multiplier Kt denotes the contribution of a marginal output unit to the
profit expressed in units of the homogenous good.
The system of first-order necessary conditions for a local maximum of the Lagrangean
(27) is obtained by forming the partial first derivatives with respect to the variables Qt,
[(t, Nt and Kt which are set equal to zero:

the production technology (see, e.g., King, Plosser & Rebelo (1988a» is disregarded.

(31)
Taking condition (28) into account, conditions (29) (31) form a system of three
equations in the three unknown quantities Kt, Nt and Qt. Owing to the linear homogeneity
of the production technology, however, the production plan {Qt, Kt,Nt} is not deter~ned
by the firms' profit maximisation. Instead, conditional factor demand functions can be
derived for a given output Qt as a function of the factor prices re, Wh
K t - K(rt, Wt; Qt), (32)
Nt - N(rh Wt; Qt), (33)
which fully characterise the firms' optimal behaviour in the model economy's factor markets
for a given output Qt.
2.4 The Competitive Equilibrium
After deriving the households' conditional decision functions and the firms' conditional
factor demand functions which determine the individual supply and demand behaviour in
the model economy's markets, we must now find out how the individual decisions are to
be coordinated.
Firstly, based on our previous assumption of perfect competition in the model economy's
factor and goods markets, the factor prices rt, Wt will coordinate the economic plans of the
individual households and firms and, in this manner, support a competitive equilibrium.
These prices depend on the state of the model economy. This state is determined by the
level of technology Zt, the fiscal policy variables Oe, t~, tt1
t;U, trI, the per-capita stock of
government bonds Bt and the per-capita capital stock Kt at the beginning of each period
t. These variables are accordingly termed state variables of the model economy. It should
be noted that any information about these state variables which goes beyond the factor
prices is not required.
Secondly, whereas the factor prices create a balance between elastic supply and elastic
demand in the factor and goods markets via a Walrasian mechanism, the rate of return Rt
can be determined by a pricing function for the bonds issued by the government to cover
its budget. This function ensures that the economy-wide accumulation of government
14 

bonds is consistent with the individual households' demand for government bonds.9 Like
the factor prices, the rate of return is a function of the state variables Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt,
Bt and Kt .
Thirdly, besides the factor prices and the rate of return, the households' intertemporal
decision depends on the expected shadow price At+llt of the government bonds held by
the households and the households' capital stock. In this context, the variables bt and kt
which were determined by the decisions made in the previous period are termed the state
variables of the households. The expected shad9w price At+llt is a function of both the
model economy's state variables Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt, Bt, Kt and the households' state
variables bt , kt .
Taking these functional relations into account, we can define a sequence of competi
tive equilibria for the model economy which satisfies the households' conditional decision
functions (19), (20), (23) derived in Subsection 2.2.2 and the conditional factor demand
functions of the firms (32), (33) derived in Subsection 2.3.2.
Definition: For a given level of technology Zt, given values of the fiscal policy variables
9t, t~, tt, t,/:,trt, a given per-capita stock of government bonds Bt, a given per-capita capital
stock Kt, a given stock of government bonds held by the households bt, and a given capital
stock of the households kt , the model economy's competitive equilibrium in each period
t = 0,1, ... is determined by the following system of functions:
E.l the factor price functions
rt r(Zt,9t,t~,tt,t,/:,trt,Bt,Kt),
Wt w(Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt, Bt,Kt),
E.2 the return function
9The return is implicitly given by the Euler equation
which is derived from the first-order necessary conditions (13) and (15) ofthe households' decision problem.
The equation has to be evaluated as a fundion of per-capita consumption C and per-capita leisure L.
Hence, it does not depend on the decisions of the individual households.

and
C.4 a balanced government budget as given by (1) taking into account government
consumption as in (2) and government transfers as in (3).
Given an identical initial capital stock J{o = ko, the equality of per-capita investment
I t and the households' investment it
implies the consistency of the updating equation for
the per-capita capital stock J{t and the updating equation for the capital stock of the
individual households kt .
The transition of the model economy from the competitive equilibrium in period t to
the competitive equilibrium in period t +1 is then determined by the transition equation
of the technology variable Zt, the transition equation of the vector of the exogenous fiscal
policy variables Vt = (gt, t~, tt,t't', trt)', the consistent updating equations for the per-capita
capital stock J{t and the households' capital stock kt as weIl as by the equation for the
government budget.
In order to determine the sequence of competitive equilibria numerical methods have to
be applied since analytical solutions are not known for the families of parametric utility and
production functions which will be considered below. In particular, we rely on the numeri
ca! methods suggested by McGrattan (1994b) and Anderson, Hansen, McGrattan & Sar
gent (1996) which aIlow computing linear competitive equilibria for linear-quadratic model
economies but require appropriately approximating non-linear economies beforehand.lO
Calibration and Simulation of the Model Economy
The RBC model described in the previous section provides a consistent framework for ana
lysing the intertemporal effects of fiscal policy. Within this framework, the intertemporal
effects reflect optimal behaviour of households and firms supporting a sequence of competi
tive equilibria. In order to quantify these effects the model economy must be appropriately
calibrated. In the following subsection, this calibration will be carried out with the aim of
reproducing selected stylised facts of the German goods and labour markets by means of
the stochastically simulated model economy.
lOFor computational details see Coenen (1997), Chapter 4.

3.1 Calibration of the Model Economy
Prior to calibrating the model economy, we have to choose parametric families for the
utility function U(Ct +7r Gt,lt) and the production function F(Kt, Nt). Then, values must
be assigned to these functions' parameters and to the discount parameter ß, the aggregation
parameter 7r, the depreciation parameter 0, the transition equation's parameters for the
technology variable Zt, the parameter 1/J of the fiscal reaction function and the transition
equation's parameters for the vector of fiscal policy variables Vt =(gt, t~, tt, t,(, trt)'.
3.1.1 Preferences and Technology
Consumption Ct +7r Gt
and leisure lt can be seen as an aggregate A(Ct +7r Gt,It) within the
utility function which will be easily obtained by Cobb-Douglas aggregation as
The households' preferences regarding Ct + 7r Gt

using the family of isoelastic utility functions with

If a household's willingness to intertemporally substitute a marginal unit At =A(Ct +

shown below, the parameter "Y, i.e. the inverse of the absolute value of the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution 7JAt

the model economy's competitive equiIibria.

3.1.2 Choice of Parameter Values
Selecting the parametric utility function and the parametric production function rounds
out the general specification of the model economy. The households' preferences are
parametrised by the discount factor ß, the aggregation parameter 11" and the parameters
,and 1> of the isoelastic utility function. Technology is parametrised by the elasticity
parameter a of the Cobb-Douglas production function, the depreciation parameter 8 of
the capital updating equation and the parameters pz and C7fz
of the transition equation for
the technology variable Zt. Fiscal policy is fully characterised by the parameter 'IjJ of the
fiscal reaction function and by the parameters vV)

librated conditional on the parameters vV)

in Subsection 2.1, whieh deseribes the evolution of the fiseal poliey variables Vt over time.
Estimates of these parameters are shown in Table 1.11 Note that the eonstant of the transi
tion equation for the transfer rate tr has been calibrated in such a way that the government
debt-to-output ratio is sustained at 60% in the steady state of the calibrated model.
The subsequent calibration of the model economy follows the literature reviewed in the
introduction or, if that does not contain any information about the choice of parameter
values, it is based on considerations of feasibility and stability. The choice of parameter
values will ultimately be evaluated against the ability of the stochastically simulated model
to approximate selected stylised facts of the German goods and labour markets.
In line with the literature on this subject, the values 0.99 and 1/3 are assigned to the
preference parameters ß and 4> respectively, and the values 0.36 and 0.025 are assigned
to the technology parameters Cl' and 6 respectively. In the quarterly analysis carried out
below, the value selected for the discount factor ß results in an annual rate of return of
roughly 4% on the capital lent by the households as weIl as on the government bonds
purchased by the households, while the value selected for the depreciation parameter 6
implies a roughly 10% annual depreciation of the existing capital stock. Owing to the
linear homogeneity of the Cobb-Douglas production function and the compensation of the
production factors according to marginal productivity, the value selected for the technology
parameter Cl' results in a wage rate of 0.64. The value chosen for the preference parameter
4> implies that in the steady state of a corresponding economy which is free from allocative
distortions caused by fiscal policy, the households' labour time amounts to slightly less
than one-third of their available time.
At this stage, the value of the aggregation parameter 1r is set at 1.00, making government
consumption a perfect substitute for private consumption. The value 0.10, which proves to
be sufficiently high to guarantee the stability of the equation for the government budget,
is assigned to the parameter tP of the fiscal reaction function. In order to limit the positive
correlation between government consumption and output - as will be explored below
in more detail - we shall assume that the innovations in the autonomous government
consumption rate f g
correlate negatively with the innovations in the technology variable f z
by fixing the correlation coefficient r ~g.~. at -0.75.12
llSee Appendix A.2 for the construction of the time series of the fiscal policy variables.
12The introduction of this negative correlation proved to be necessary since the autonomous component
of government consumption is specified to depend linearlyon output within the model, whereas the data
20 

We will set the values of the technology parameters pz and at 0.90 and 0.0075,
(J'fz
respectively, for which the volatility and persistence of the output time series generated
by the stochastically simulated model are largely consistent with the corresponding figures
of the empirical time series.13 Finally, illustrating the impact of the households' willing
ness to intertemporally substitute on the dynamic properties of the model, the preference
parameter I will be calibrated within a sensitivity analysis which is carried out for the
alternative values of 0.50, 1.00, 3.00 and 5.00 in the following subsection.
The values of the preference, technology and fiscal policy parameters used in this sen
sitivity analysis are summarised in Table 2.

3.1.3 A Sensitivity Analysis
In order to assess the sensitivity of the model's dynamics with respect to the households'
preference parameter I, a set of 100 replications of time series having a sampie size of 140
were simulated for the variables of the goods and labour markets Q, C, I, G, wand N.
For each replication the simulations were initialised in the model economy's steady state.
The standard deviations and contemporaneous correlations of the simulated time series are
reported in Table 3. In this table, they are contrasted with the corresponding empirical
figures of the German goods and labour markets which were gathered for a sampie period
ranging from the first quarter of 1960 to the fourth quarter of 1994.
In line with the literature, the empirical and simulated time series have been detrended
by means of the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter before computing the standard deviations
and the contemporaneous correlations. In this context it should be noted that the stan
dard deviations measure the average relative deviation of the time series from their trend
component.14
show a negative correlation between output and government eonsumption.

For a preference parameter value of '"1 = 3.00, the standard deviation of the simulated

and the standard deviation of the simulated private consumption time
series U c which amount to 1.52% and 1.38%, respectively, almost match the variability of
1.54% and 1.37% estimated for the empirical time series. However, at 4,96% and 3.57%,
respectively, the standard deviation of the simulated investment time series U1 and of
the time series for government consumption U G prove to be too high compared with the
empirical figures of 4.03% and 1.82%.
market are constructed as weH as for the determination of their HP trend component.
22
In terms of the theoretical model, the low variability of private consumption compared
with the variability of investment is due to the households' limited willingness to intertem
porally substitute consumption: The households absorb cyclical fluctuations of production,
and hence of income, by adjusting their investment activity. That means the simulated
time series of private consumption exhibit less pronounced cyclical fluctuations compared
with the simulated output time series, whereas the simulated investment time series show
more violent cyclical fluctuations.
Lower preference parameter values of , = 1.00 and , = 0.50, respectively, which
imply a gradually increase in the households' willingness to intertemporally substitute,
induce an increase in the cyclical fluctuations of the simulated goods market time series.
A higher preference parameter value of , = 5.00 leads to a decrease in the variability of
the simulated time series, which reduces the compatibility of the simulated time series of
output and private consumption with the empirical time series.
There is a positive contemporaneous correlation between output and private consump
tion as weH as between output and investment for both the simulated and the empirical
time series. Compared with the correlations computed for the empirical time series, how
ever, the correlations implied by the model prove to be too low for private consumption
and too high for investment: For, 3.00, these correlations amount to rC,Q = 0.10 and
rl,Q = 0.99, respectively. An increase in the households' willingness to intertemporally sub
stitute, i.e. decreasing values for " leads to implausible negative correlations for private
consumption.
The model's positive contemporaneous correlation between government consumption
and output - for instance, rG,Q
= 0.28 holds for , = 3.00 proves to be incompatible
with the negative correlation of -0.13 as measured for the empirical time series. This lack of
compatibility may be due to the specification of the government's consumption function,
according to which the autonomous component of government consumption depends li
nearly on current output. Even if a negative correlation between the innovations of the
technology variable Ez
and the innovations of the autonomous government consumption
rate Eg
of r~g,~z = -0.75 is taken into account while simulating the model economy, this is
not sufficient to contain the excessive positive correlation.
Looking at the standard deviations and the contemporaneous correlation of the labour
market variables for , = 3.00, we find for the simulated model economy that the standard
deviation of the real wage 0'w
of 0.89% is much lower than the empirical value of 1.55%.
23 

Furthermore, at rH.... = 0.02, the eontemporaneous eorrelation implied by the models is too
low compared with the empirieal eorrelation of 0.59. The standard deviation of the real
wage inereases with a gradually rising willingness to make intertemporal substitutions, i.e.
for deereasing values of '1, but, at the same time, the eontemporaneous eorrelation of both
variables deereases.
At first sight, the diserepancies between the empirieal data and the simulated data
may appear relatively large.15 However, one must bear in mind that both the empirical
data and the simulated data are subject to uneertainty. If eonfidence intervals were to be
introdueed for the empirieal and simulated figures when assessing the eompatibility of the
model with the data, the diserepancies between them would turn out to be less obvious,
partieularly regarding the standard deviations of the goods market variables. Furthermore,
considering the high degree of abstra.ction of the model's strueture, this result should not
eome as a surprise at all.
Nevertheless, without using a formal statistieal eriterion, the simulated model appears
to match the measured data best for a preference parameter value of '1 = 3.00.16 Henee,
this value is used for simulating the intertemporal effects of fiseal poliey in the following
subsection.
3.2 Simulation of Fiscal Policy Scenarios
The vector of steady-state values of the exogenous fiscal poliey variables are given by the
uneonditional expectation of the vector-autoregressive proeess deseribing their evolution
over time with v = (ls - At/tl",,, where v
=(g, te

tel, tW
,

Av
and vt/ given in Table 2 above yields the estimated vector of steady state values
v=
(15 - Av)-lvv =(0.20,0.10,0.13,0.21,0.15)'.
If ehanges in these steady-state values are eonsidered to be parameter ehanges, the
long-run effects of various fiscal poliey measures on the models's endogenous variables Q,
C, I, G, B, K, N, w, r and R ean easily be assessesd within a eomparative-static analysis.
Furthermore, the adjustment of the endogenous variables to their new steady-state values
computed beforehand in the eomparative-statie analysis ean be explored by means of the

model's impulse responses to the permanent changes in the fiscal policy variables. These
impulse responses are realisations of a sequence of competitive equilibria describing the
optimal behaviour of households and firms.
3.2.1 Comparative-Static Analysis
Table 4 shows the long-run effects of alternative fiscal policy scenarios which aim at per
manently reducing the burden oI taxes and levies. Since the revenue shortfalls due to
permanent reductions in taxes and levies induce an increase in government debt B which
exceeds the increase in output Q, it will be necessary to reduce government spending in
order to maintain the long-run government debt-to-output ratio (BIQ) at 60%. This
spending cut will be obtained by appropriately adjusting the autonomous government con
sumption rate g.
In the long run, a decrease of the consumption tax rate [c by one percentage point
(Scenario I) reduces the relative price of the consumption good which leads to a 1.57% rise
in consumption. Furthermore, the households' substitution decisions involve a curtailing
of leisure demand and a complementary increase in labour supply. In the new steady
state, the labour input and the capital stock used for production both increase by 0.65%.
Owing to the uniform increase in the input oI both the production factors, output likewise
increases by 0.65%,17 Since the ratio of the production factors employed remains the same,
there is no change in factor prices. The reduction of the consumption tax rate results in
revenue shortfalls, so that, via a reduction in the government consumption rate by 0.51
percentage points, government consumption must be reduced by 1.92% in order to maintain
the government debt-to-output ratio at 60%.
The incentive to invest due to lowering the income tax rate [d by one percentage point
(Scenario II) leads to a 1.02% increase in capital accumulation. Labour input increases by
0.45%, and output by 0.66%. Since labour is used relatively scarce in production, the wage
rate rises by 0.20%, whereas the capital rental cost diminishes by 0.36%. The growth in
the households' income induced by the increased input of the production factors and the
lowering of the income tax rate leads to a 1.59% rise in private consumption. To stabilise
the government debt-to-output ratio, government consumption must be cut by 2.39%.

Lowering the wage levy rate fW by one percentage point (Scenario III) leads to a 0.77%
increase in employment. Firstly, this result reflects the fact that the reduction of the wage
levy rate half to to be paid by the firms leads to a reduction of labour costs in production.
Secondly, the stimulated labour demand of the firms is accompanied by an increase in the
households' willingness to work because the reduction of the wage levies they have to pay
leads to lower deductions from the households' wage income. As in Scenario I, capital and
employment rise to the same amount, which means the wage rate and the capital rental
cast da not change. The rise in disposable income caused by both the increased input of
the production factars and the reduction of the wage levy rate leads to a 2.14% increase in
private consumption. The increase in government debt caused by the wage levy reduction
necessitates a 3.03% cut in government consumption.
Scenario IV investigates the effects of a fiscal policy measure which combines a one
percentage point reduction of the income tax rate fd with an one percentage point increase
in the consumption tax rate fC. Ta a certain degree, this scenario pays tribute to the debate
on a change in the structure of the German tax system, according to which direct taxes
should be lowered, whereas indirect taxes should be raised in order to provide stronger
incentives to invest. As to be expected, the resulting change in the fador price ratio in
favour of capital yields an 0.38% increase in the capital stock. However, the growing capital
stock goes hand in hand with a substitution of labour which leads to a reduction in labour
input of 0.19%. Output only increases by 0.02%. In view of the fact that merelyan 0.10%
cut in government consumption rate is required to stabilise the government debt-to-output
ratio, the combined measure proves to be almost self-financing.
Finally, Scenario V studies the effects of a reduction in the wage levy rate fW by one
percentage point which is (partly) offset by raising the consumption tax rate fC to the
same amount. The 0.13% increase in output is accompanied by a uniform increase in
employment and the capital stock. The implied revenue shortfalls require a 1.10% cut in
government consumption in order to stabilise the government debt-to-output ratio.
When assessing the lang-run welfare effects of the alternative fiscal policy scenarios,
one must take into account the fact that the isolated changes in consumption consisting
of a private and a government component are not a suitable yardstick for evaluating their
overall welfare implications. Besides changes in consumption, a comprehensive assessment
must also include the changes in welfare induced by leisure changes. A suitable indicator
is the consumption equivalent, which equates the single-period utility of the households
27 

in the initial steady state with their single-period utility in the new steady state implied
by the particular fiscal policy measure. The (steady state) consumption equivalent !:l.C is
calculated using the single-period utility function U by solving the equation
where (C + 'lrG,L) and (6 + 'lrG,L) denote the equilibrium values of consumption and
leisure in the initial and in the new steady state, respectively.
In the case of Scenarios I to III, assuming 'Ir
= 1.00, the reductions in taxes and levies
lead to welfare increases of 0.30, 0.30 and 0.36%, respectively, as reported in the last line of
Table 4. Hence, the increase in private consumption overcompensates in terms of welfare
for the reduction of leisure and the cut in government consumption needed to stabilise the
government debt-to-output ratio.
To shed some light on the sensitivity of these results with regard to the aggregation
parameter 'Ir, alternative consumption equivalents are calculated for 'Ir
=0.00 and 'Ir
=2.00,
i.e. assuming that government consumption is either not beneficial or even more beneficial
than private consumption.18 Compared to the baseline case with 'Ir
= 0, welfare increases
(decreases) for 'Ir = 1.00 ('Ir = 2.00). This result is due to the fact that the reduction
in government consumption required in order to consolidate the government budget does
diminish the utility of the households not at all (to a greater extent).
In Scenarios IV and V, assuming 'Ir = 1.00, the positive welfare effects resulting from
the reduction of the income tax and the wage levies are (largely) offset by the negative
welfare effects generated by the increase in the consumption tax and the cut in government
consumption required to finance the reductions. This assessment changes if government
consumption does not increase utility, i.e. if 'Ir
= 0.00. In that case, the consumption
equivalents amount to 0.13% and 0.51%, i.e. both the changeover from direct to indirect
taxation and the lowering of the labour costs of the firms, the latter being financed by
raising indirect taxes, imply positive welfare effects.
Since, ultimately, the analysis of the theoretical model does not provide a satisfactory
basis for the choice of the parameter value for 'Ir, the final assessment of the welfare effects
generated by the alternative fiscal policy scenarios must be left to the reader's judgement.
This judgement may be based on Figure 1 which shows the consumption equivalent of the
18This calculation is Ceasible because the steady-state values oC the endogenous variables do not depend

28
fiscal policy scenarios depending on the aggregation parameter 1f'. For below-unity values
of 1f', any of the scenarios under consideration proves to be welfare-increasing. However,
there is a critical value for each scenario. Exceeding this value will yield a negative welfare
effect.

Yet if we consider that the model economy only features a single homogenous good, and
that, on the basis of our model, the argument that government consumption may increase
the households' utility more than private consumption is hence not very convincing, it then
appears justified to use 1f' 1.00 as the upper benchmark value for the assessment of the
welfare effects. As a consequence, positive welfare effects are to be expected from the fiscal
policy measures under review.
3.2.2 Dynamic Analysis
As a complement to the comparative-static analysis of the fiscal policy measures, we will
now turn to the model economy's dynamic adjustment to its new steady state implied by
the permanent reduction in taxes and levies. For Scenarios I to III the adjustment paths,
i.e. the impulse response functions of the endogenous variables, are illustrated in Figure 2.
The impulse responses are expressed as percentage deviations from the initial steady-state
values.

As the figure shows, the endogenous variables follow similar paths in response to the
lasting reduction of taxes and levies across the alternative scenarios. This is due to the fact
that each lowering of taxes and levies induces a unidirectional reduction in the allocative
distortions of the model economy. This reduction enhances the households' propensity to
work and leads to a rise in overall economic activity which, in the long run, increases the
welfare of the households, as demonstrated in the preceding subsection.
The fiscal policy measures clearly generate positive effects, even in the short run. Above
all, these effects are the result of the immediate increase in employment which leads to an
31

increase in output, and hence to a rise in the households' income. During the adjustment
to the new steady state, the optimal choice of the households consists in temporarily
restraining consumption in spite of the increase in their current income resulting from the
reduction in taxes and levies and to use it for investments. With the gradual increase in
the capital stock of the economy, the capacity effect caused by the boost in investment
impacts on production and leads to a rise in the households' future income and, thus,
to an improvement of their future consumption opportunities. Owing to the households'
forward-looking optimal plans, these future consumption opportunities are already taken
into account in their current decisions, which explains why the households temporarily
forego consumption.
In the short run, the positive output effects make it possible to even increase govern
ment consumption. The increase is financed by a rise in tax revenues resulting from the
rise in output, which, in turn, implies an increase in taxable income. In this case, the rise
in tax revenues even leads to a temporary reduction in government debt. In the course of
the adjustment to the new steady state, government debt increases again. However, the
restraint in government consumption induced by the reduction of the autonomous govern
ment consumption rate will ensure that the government debt-to-output ratio remains at
60% over the long run.
The scenarios differ as to the extent of the short and medium-term adjustments. Com
pared with changes in the income tax rate, changes in the consumption tax rate and the
wage levy rate will cause factor prices, employment and output to react more strongly.
By contrast, a change in the income tax rate leads to higher investment and, hence, more
restrained consumption. The resulting increase in government revenue and expenditure
causes a greater transitory reduction in government debt, which implies a higher increase
in the rate of return owing to more restrained private consumption. These phenomena
refiect the fact that income taxes exert a relatively strong influence on the households' in
tertemporal consumption-investment decisions, whereas their intratemporallabour-leisure
choices are affected to a greater extent by consumption taxes and wage levies.
As regards the above interpretation of the short and medium-term adjustments, one
must consider that the Walrasian model economy under review does not include institu
tional rigidities: The effects of the fiscal policy measures, which are positive even in the
short run, presumably hinge on the assumption of market-dearing by immediate price ad
justments. Hence, an extension of the model covering lagged price adjustment mechanisms
32 

4
would have to analyse the extent to which the short and medium-term adjustments would
be robust.
Summary and Conclusions
This paper has analysed the intertemporal effects of fiscal policy reforms as requested of
economic policy in Germany within the framework of a calibrated RBC model. Based on
alternative scenarios, the analysis demonstrated that a reduction of the burden of taxes
and levies, criticised as too high in the economic policy debate, will lead to an increase
in overall economic activity. In each scenario, the revenue shortfalls induced by lowering
the taxes and levies are offset by a cut in government consumption, which implies that
the government debt-to-output ratio can be lastingly maintained and, hence, that the
sustainability of the .government budget is ensured. For plausible values of the weighting
of government consumption in the households' utility function, the alternative fiscal policy
scenarios have positive welfare effects.
The increase in overall economic activity is a consequence of the reduction in intra
temporal and intertemporal allocative distortions induced by taxes and levies. It is shown
that the accumulation of capital can be stimulated, in particular, by income tax reduc
tions. However, the analysis also reveals that a rise in the capital stock resulting from an
income tax cut implies the substitution of labour which is becoming comparatively expen
sive. Instead, a stronger increase in employment can be achieved by reducing the levies on
wage income. A partial changeover from income to consumption taxes leads to an increase
in investment but also to lower employment, whereas a reduction in the levies on wage
income offset by raising the consumption tax triggers an increase in both investment and
employment.
Whereas the findings support a supply-oriented economic policy which aims at redu
cing government activities, their final assessment should take into account the fact that
the model is an abstraction of a number of important factors that, in general, motivate
government action. For instance, government investment providing public infrastructure
is disregarded, as is the explicit introduction of a social security system which would be
justified by an intra- or intergenerational redistribution objective. In addition, the model
does not take into account rigidities and market imperfections which can lead to persistent
imbalances a fact that holds particularly true for the labour market.
33 

Nonetheless, this paper highlights major obstacles on the supply side which stand in the
way of sustained economic growth supported by increased investment and a higher level of
employment. Thereby, analysing the arguments calling for the removal of these obstacles
within adynamie general equilibrium model and identifying the assumptions underlying
these arguments, this paper may offer a disciplining analytical input to the economic policy
debate on the appropriate design of fiscal policy in order to improve the investment and
employment conditions and, thus, to promote overall economic activity.

A The Data
This appendix describes the construction of the data which are employed to calibrate the
above RBC model. The data build on time series taken from the national accounts of the
Federal Republic of Germany (West) with a sampie period ranging from the first quarter
of 1960 to the fourth quarter of 1994.
A.l The Variables of the Goods and the Labour Market
To construct the per-capita variables of the goods and labour markets the following time
series were taken from the German national accounts:
· Gross domestic product at 1991 prices (in DM billion)
· Private consumption at 1991 prices (in DM billion)
· Investment: fixed capital formation by firms at 1991 prices (in DM billion)
· Government consumption at 1991 prices (in DM billion)
· Compensation of employees: gross wages and salaries (in DM billion)
· Employed persons: total number of hours worked (in billion hours)
· Price index of the gross domestic product (1991 = 100)
· Resident population (in 1,000 people)
Where required, the time series are seasonally adjusted using the Census X-lI method.
The seasonally-adjusted time series of the gross wages and salaries is deflated by the price
index of the gross domestic product. By dividing the adjusted time series by the time
series of the resident population, we obtain the time series of the real per-capita variables,
i.e. of output Q, private consumption C, private investment I, government consumption
C, real wage wand employment N.
Since the time series of the per-capita variables are non-stationary, a suitable trend
adjustment must be carried out. In line with the literature, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter is applied which presumes that the time series of a variable Y (in logarithms) can be
decomposed into a smooth trend component y9 plus a residual component yr,
Yt = Yt9
+
Ytl
r t=l, ... ,T.
35

Further assuming that the mean of the residual component yr equals zero, the trend
component y9 is defined as the solution to the following quadratic minimisation problem:19
The first term of the objective function to be minimised captures the fit of the trend
component to the data, whereas the second term captures its smoothness. The parameter
A controls these two conHicting properties. For A =0, the component y9 is perfectly fitted
to the data, such that yf = Yt holds. If the determination of y9 only takes account of the
smoothness, Le. for A -+ 00, y9 follows a linear trend.20
Figure 3 shows the time series of the per-capita variables of the goods and labour
markets as weIl as their HP trend component for a parameter value of A = I, 600 which is
generally used for quarterly time series in the literature.
A.2 The Fiscal Policy Variables
Complementing the above data, the following time series from the national accounts are
used for constructing the fiscal policy variables:
· Investment: depredations by firms (in DM billion)
· Compensation of employees: sodal contributions by employers (in DM billion)
· Current transfers: direct domestic taxes paid to the government (in DM billion)
· Current transfers: social benefits the government pays to the households (in DM
billion)
· Gross value added: non-deductible turnover tax (in DM billion)
The time series are seasonally adjusted using the Census X-lI method and deHated by
the price index of the gross domestic product.
19See Hodrick &; Prescott (1980), Prescott (1986) and Cooley &; Prescott (1995).
20King &; Rebelo (1993) demonstrate that the cyclical component of a time series integrated up to order
d = 4, which is determined by applying the HP filter, is stationary. However, statistical problems arising
from HP filtering non-stationary time series are addressed in Barvey &; Jäger (1993), Jäger (1994) and
Cogley &; Nason (1995).

The government consumption rate 9 is calculated as the share of real gross domestic
product taken up by real government consumption. The consumption tax rate tC is calcu
lated as the ratio of the sum of real private and government consumption and the sum of
real private and government consumption less government's real value-added tax revenue,
minus one. Owing to the linear homogeneity of the model's production technology and the
deductibility of the depredations from the households' taxable capital income, the income
tax rate td is defined as the share of real gross domestic product less real depreciation
accounted for by real direct taxes. The wage levy rate tUi denotes the share of the employ
ers' real sodal contributions to real total gross wages and salaries. The transfer rate tr
is calculated as the share of real gross domestic product accounted for by the real sodal
benefits the households receive from the government.
