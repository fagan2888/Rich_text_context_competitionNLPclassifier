Controversy exists about whether the repeatedly documented associations between smoking
and subsequent suicide-related outcomes (SROs; ideation, plans, gestures and attempts) are
due to unmeasured common causes or to causal effects of smoking on SROs. We address this
issue by examining associations of smoking with subsequent SROs with and without controls
for potential explanatory variables in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) panel. The latter
consists of 5001 people who participated in both the 1990­2002 NCS and the 2001­2003 NCS
follow-up survey. Explanatory variables include sociodemographics, potential common
causes (parental history of mental­substance disorders; other respondent childhood
adversities) and potential mediators (respondent history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 3rd edn, revised mental­substance disorders). Small gross (that is,
without controls) prospective associations are found between history of early-onset nicotine
dependence and both subsequent suicide ideation and, among ideators, subsequent suicide
plans. None of the baseline smoking measures, though, predicts subsequent suicide gestures
or attempts among ideators. The smoking-ideation association largely disappear, but the
association of early-onset nicotine dependence with subsequent suicide plans persists (odds
ratio = 3.0), after adjustment for control variables. However, the latter association is as strong
with remitted as active nicotine dependence, arguing against a direct causal effect of nicotine
dependence on suicide plans. Decomposition of the control variable effects, furthermore,
suggests that these effects are due to common causes more than to mediators. These results
refine our understanding of the ways in which smoking is associated with later SROs and for
the most part argue against the view that these associations are due to causal effects of
smoking.

Introduction
Several large prospective epidemiological studies
have documented significant positive associations
between smoking and subsequent suicide deaths.1­7
Dose­response relationships have been found in
some of these studies, with suicide risk higher among
current than past5 and heavy than light2,4,5,7 smokers.
These studies also have generally shown that the
smoking­suicide relationship persists even after con-
trolling for sociodemographics and alcohol consump-
tion.1,4­7 However, the one study that introduced more
comprehensive controls for indicators of baseline
psychological functioning (for example, psychiatric
diagnosis, medication for emotional problems and
drug use) found that the smoking­suicide relation-
ship disappeared.2 Although this result might be
interpreted as showing that psychological distress
explains the association between smoking and
suicide, another possibility is that smoking is a risk
factor for psychological distress, that distress med-
iates the effects of smoking on suicide, and that
smoking does, in fact, have a causal effect on suicide.
There is no way to distinguish these two interpreta-
tions with available published data.
Some insights into the predictive effect of smoking
on suicide can be obtained from studies of smoking
and nonfatal suicide-related outcomes (SROs), such
as suicide ideation, suicide plans and nonfatal
suicide attempts, although it also important to
recognize that only a very small proportion of people
with ideation, plans or even attempts ever die from

suicide. Research on smoking and suicide requires
very large samples that sometime have to be
followed many years. It is much easier to study the
relationship of smoking with more commonly
occurring SROs. The latter are relevant outcomes
because SROs are the immediate precursors to suicide
death and are important in their own right because
they are associated with substantial distress and
injury.
Statistically significant associations similar to those
between smoking and suicide deaths have been
documented between smoking and SROs in cross-
sectional8­10 and prospective9,11 studies in both gen-
eral population samples8­10,12 and clinical sam-
ples.13,14 These associations have held up after
controlling for sociodemographics and limited mea-
sures of psychological functioning (including mea-
sures of depression and drug use disorders). A
number of other studies, though,15­18 have found that
smoking is not significantly related to SROs after
controlling more comprehensively for mental disor-
ders. However, as the temporal priorities between
smoking and mental disorders were not established in
these studies, it remains unclear whether this finding
should be interpreted as due to confounding (that is,
mental disorders causing both smoking and SROs) or
mediation (that is, smoking causing mental disorders
and mental disorders, in turn, causing SROs).
It is difficult to make sense of available epidemio-
logical data on this question because smoking is a
complex addictive behavior that clusters with other
behavioral risk factors for suicide and SROs.19­22 An
additional complication is that basic research on
smoking suggests that smoking might plausibly be
both a cause and a consequence of psychopatho-
logy.23­27 Chronic smoking, for example, has been
found to reduce the sensitivity of serotonin receptors
in the frontal cortex,24 possibly promoting depression.
Acute exposure to smoking, on the other hand, may
have the opposite physiologic effect by raising
serotonin levels in the frontal cortex,26 providing a
physiologic explanation for the hypothesis that some
people with affective disorders self-medicate their
dysphoria by smoking.
The current study was designed to provide new
information about the epidemiology of smoking and
SROs by analyzing data from a nationally representa-
tive two-wave panel survey of the US population that
was interviewed originally in 1990­1992 and then
again a decade later in 2001­2003. Unlike previous
studies, which merely attempted to document and
then explain away the prospective association be-
tween smoking and SROs by introducing controls for
baseline variables, we set out to distinguish the effects
of confounding and mediating variables in explaining
this association. The analysis is based on a dataset
that has more comprehensive measures of smoking,
SROs and mental disorders than previous studies. In
addition, the sample is more broadly representative
and the follow-up period is longer than in most
previous studies.
Materials and methods
Sample
Data come from the 5001 respondents who partici-
pated in the 1990­1992 National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS)28 and the 2001­2003 NCS follow-up survey
(NCS-2).29 The NCS28 was a nationally representative
US survey of 8098 respondents aged 15­54 years with
a response rate of 82.4%. Interviews were conducted
by professional survey interviewers and administered
in two parts. Part I, which included the core
diagnostic interview, was administered to all respon-
dents. Part II, which included additional disorders
and risk factors, was administered to a probability
subsample of 5877 respondents including all respon-
dents aged 15­24 years, all others with any lifetime
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
3rd edn, revised (DSM-III-R) disorder assessed in
Part I, and a random subsample of remaining Part I
respondents. The Part II sample was weighted to
adjust for differential probabilities of selection and for
nonresponse bias. The nonresponse adjustment
weight was based on the results of a brief screening
survey carried out in a representative subsample
of initial survey nonrespondents. Further details
about the NCS design and weighting are reported
elsewhere.28
The NCS-2 sought to trace and reinterview all Part
II NCS respondents a decade after the NCS. Of the
5463 respondents successfully traced, 166 were
deceased and 5001 reinterviewed, for a conditional
response rate of 87.6%. The unconditional response
rate was 72.2% (0.876 Â 0.824). NCS-2 respondents
were assessed using an expanded version of the
baseline interview that assessed onset and course of
disorders between the two surveys. Relative to other
baseline NCS respondents, NCS-2 respondents were
significantly more likely to be female, well educated
and residents of rural areas. A propensity score
adjustment weight30 corrected for these discrepan-
cies. Importantly, there was no difference between
NCS-2 respondents and nonrespondents in their
reports of SROs at the baseline assessment.31
Suicide-related outcomes
SROs were assessed using parallel questions in the
NCS and NCS-2. At the baseline assessment, respon-
dents were asked about lifetime experiences of
suicide ideation (`Have you ever seriously thought
about committing suicide?'), suicide plans (`Have you
ever made a plan for committing suicide?') and
suicide attempts (`Have you ever attempted suicide?').
Because self-administered surveys have been shown
to yield higher rates of reporting embarrassing
behaviors than interviewer-administered surveys,32
SROs were assessed in a self-administered booklet.
Respondents who reported an SRO were asked
questions about age of onset and recency. Those
who reported a suicide attempt were also presented
with three statements and asked to identify the one
that best described their experience: `(1) I made a

serious attempt to kill myself and it was only luck that
I did not succeed; (2) I tried to kill myself but I knew
the method was not foolproof; (3) My attempt was a
cry for help, I did not want to die.' In line with
contemporary distinctions between suicidal and
nonsuicidal self-injury,33,34 respondents endorsing
statements 1 or 2 were considered to have made a
suicide attempt, whereas respondents endorsing
statement 3 were considered to have made a suicide
`gesture' (that is, potentially injurious behavior in
which the intent was not to die, but to signal distress
and/or to seek help from others). At the NCS-2 follow-
up assessment, respondents were asked a similar
series of self-administered SRO questions as at base-
line, but this time focusing on the interval between
the two surveys rather than over their lifetime. In
analyzing these data, we distinguished between new
onsets (that is, SROs at follow-up among those who
denied ever having such an experience at baseline)
and persistence (that is, SROs that occurred between
the two surveys among respondents who also
reported a lifetime history of the same experiences
at baseline).
Smoking
All baseline NCS respondents were asked if they ever
smoked even occasionally. Those who responded
affirmatively were asked retrospectively to report
the age when they had their first smoke. Recency of
smoking was also assessed, with respondents who
reported smoking at all in the past year being defined
`current' smokers and those with less recent smoking
defined `past' smokers. In addition, a Tobacco
Supplement, in which more detailed information
about history of smoking was obtained, was adminis-
tered to a representative subsample of 4414 Part II
NCS respondents out of the total Part II sample of
5877. The Tobacco Supplement began with a screen-
ing question that asked respondent if they ever in
their life smoked daily for a month or more. Lifetime
daily smokers were also assessed for DSM-III-R
nicotine dependence. Age of onset and recency of
daily smoking and nicotine dependence were as-
sessed using the same approach as in the assessment
of lifetime use. The NCS-2 assessment repeated these
questions for respondents who were not in the
baseline Tobacco Supplement.
Other risk factors for SROs
We also considered the effects of additional baseline
risk factors for SROs, focusing on risk factors that
have been documented in the literature as potential
determinants of the relationship between smoking
and SROs.2,17,18 These included sociodemographic
controls, baseline measures that might most reason-
ably be conceptualized as common causes of respon-
dent smoking and SROs (parental history of common
mental­substance disorders and other respondent
childhood adversities), and baseline measures that
might possibly be mediators of the effects of smoking
on SROs (respondent lifetime of DSM-III-R mental
disorders, history of substance use and history of
treatment for mental­substance problems). We also
controlled for baseline history of SROs to distinguish
first onsets from recurrences in the intervening
decade. As the results of analyses using these controls
to predict the outcomes considered here have been
reported previously,31 they are not discussed in the
current report.
Baseline sociodemographic controls included age,
sex, race-ethnicity, marital status, employment status,
religious affiliation, education, family income and
having/not having a young child. Parental mental
disorders were assessed with the Family History
Research Diagnostic Criteria interview35 and its
extension.36 The parental disorders included were
major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, antisocial personality disorder and alcohol­
drug dependence. Other respondent childhood ad-
versities assessed included neglect, physical abuse,
sexual abuse and childhood financial adversity.
These measures were developed specifically for the
baseline NCS.37
Baseline respondent DSM-III-R disorders included
lifetime and recent (in the year before the baseline
interview) mood disorders (major depressive, bipolar I
and dysthymic disorders), anxiety disorders (panic
disorder, agoraphobia without panic, social phobia,
simple phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and
posttraumatic stress disorder), substance use disor-
ders (alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence) and
antisocial spectrum disorders (conduct disorder and
adult antisocial behavior). These disorders were
assessed at baseline with the World Health Organiza-
tion Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI).38­40 Quantity­frequency of alcohol use were
assessed with both lifetime (the one year in the
respondent's life when he drank the most) and
12-month questions about how many days in a typical
month the respondent drank and number of drinks on
days drinking. Frequency of illicit drug use was
assessed with both lifetime and 12-month questions
about how many days in a typical month the
respondent used each of a wide variety of illicit
drugs. Baseline history of treatment for emotional­
substance problems was defined dichotomously in
response to a series of questions about treatment for
specific disorders in the CIDI.
Statistical analyses
Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the preva-
lence of SROs that occurred between the two surveys.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis41 was used to
estimate associations of baseline smoking with the
subsequent onset and persistence of SROs, with and
without controls for other baseline risk factors. In
order to distinguish effects in predicting suicide
ideation from effects on rarer SROs that are con-
tingent on ideation, separate equations were used to
predict ideation in the total sample and then, within
the subsample of ideators, to predict conditional
risk of plans, gestures and attempts. A Tobacco

Supplement dummy variable (DTS) was included in
the prediction equations to distinguish panel survey
respondents who were in the Tobacco Supplement
from other respondents. Both types of respondents
were included in the initial analyses, where the
baseline smoking data were treated as equivalent in
both subsamples even though these data were
obtained retrospectively from panel sample respon-
dents who did not participate in the NCS Tobacco
Supplement. Once final models were developed,
these models were expanded to include interactions
between the smoking predictors and the DTS dummy
variable in order to determine if the magnitude of the
associations of baseline smoking and nicotine depen-
dence with the later SROs differs significantly in the
subsamples where smoking was assessed prospec-
tively vs retrospectively.
Logistic regression coefficients and their 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) were exponentiated
to create odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. The
latter are presented here because they are easier to
interpret than logistic regression coefficients. The
term `gross effects' of baseline smoking and nicotine
dependence is used to refer to associations based on
prediction equations that controlled only for baseline
sociodemographics and baseline history of SROs. The
term `net effects,' in comparison, is used to refer to
associations based on prediction equations that
additionally controlled for the full set of baseline risk
factors enumerated above. Continuous predictors
were divided into categories to minimize the effects
of extreme values, whereas some categories of
predictors were combined to stabilize associations
when the odds ratio (OR) did not differ meaningfully
across contiguous categories. Standard errors and
significance tests were estimated using the Taylor
series method42 implemented in the SUDAAN soft-
ware system43 to adjust for NCS and NCS-2 design
effects. Multivariate significance was evaluated using
Wald w2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient
variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance
was evaluated using two-tailed 0.05 level tests.
Results
Onset and persistence of SROs
As reported elsewhere,31 13.3% of the 5001 respon-
dents who participated in both waves of the survey
reported a lifetime history of suicide ideation at
baseline, whereas 4.0% reported a baseline history of
a suicide plan, 2.2% a suicide gesture and 2.2% a
suicide attempt (Table 1). Substantial proportions of
the respondents with a baseline SRO history reported
recurrences a decade later: 35.0% of those with a
baseline history of suicide ideation, 21.2% of those
with a history of plans, 10.8% of those with a history
of gestures and 15.4% of those with a baseline history
of attempts. An additional 6.2% of panel respondents
reported the first onset of suicide ideation in the
decade between the surveys, whereas 2.3% reported
the first onset of a suicide plan, 0.7% a suicide
gesture and 0.9% a suicide attempt. Combining
recurrences and first onsets, a full 10.0% of respon-
dents reported having suicide ideation in the decade
between the surveys, whereas 3.0% had a suicide
plan, 0.9% made a suicide gesture and 1.3% made a
suicide attempt. The majority of these cases (53.7% of
ideation and 71.8­73.5% of the other SROs) represent
first onsets in the decade between the two surveys.
Gross associations of baseline smoking and nicotine
dependence with subsequent SROs
The gross associations (odds-ratios) of baseline smok-
ing-related predictors with subsequent SROs were
found generally not to differ in predicting SRO onset
and persistence (detailed results available on
request). As a result, we focus here on pooled
associations that combine the prediction of onset
with the prediction of persistence. A total of eight
separate baseline smoking-related variables were
considered one at a time in models to predict
subsequent SROs: lifetime smoking, age of first use,
lifetime daily smoking, age of first daily use,
frequency-recency of lifetime use (non-daily lifetime
use, past daily use, current daily use), lifetime
nicotine dependence, age of first dependence and
recency of dependence. A total of 17 regression
coefficients were estimated to examine the associa-
tions of these eight variables with each of the
subsequent SROs (Table 2). All of these coefficients
are elevated, 70% of them (12/17) significantly so at
the 0.05 level, in predicting suicide ideation. A
somewhat smaller proportion (88%) are elevated,
17% of them (3/17) significantly so, in predicting
suicide plans. Only slightly more than half of the
coefficients (58%), in comparison, are elevated in
predicting suicide gestures and only a minority (29%)
are elevated in predicting suicide attempts. None of
the coefficients is significant in predicting either
gestures or attempts.
Interactions of the DTS dummy variable with the 17
smoking-related predictors in predicting the four
outcomes are significant for only 1 of the 68
coefficients, which is no more than we would expect
by chance. Consistent with this result, replication of
these analyses exclusively in the subsample of
respondents who participated in the baseline Tobacco
Supplement found the same results as in Table 2
(detailed results available on request). These findings
argue against the possibility that retrospective recall
bias in the subsample of respondents who did not
participate in the baseline Tobacco Supplement
accounts for the findings in Table 2. On the basis of
these findings, we retained respondents who did not
participate in the Tobacco Supplement in subsequent
analyses.
A modest dose­response pattern can be seen in the
aggregate predictions in two places in Table 2. First,
the OR associated with lifetime dependence is some-
what higher than the OR associated with daily use,
whereas the latter is somewhat higher than the OR
associated with use. Second, early ages of use, daily

use and dependence are associated with somewhat
higher risks than later onsets. However, neither of
these patterns is statistically significant. Furthermore,
contrary to expectation, current (at the time of the
baseline interview) daily use and dependence are not
associated with higher risk than past daily use and
dependence. Similarly modest evidence for a dose­
response pattern can be seen in the prediction of
suicide plans. Even this modest pattern breaks down,
though, in predicting gestures and attempts.
Net associations of baseline smoking and nicotine
dependence with subsequent SROs
The introduction of additional controls in the net
models generally leads to a decrease in the already
fairly modest associations of baseline smoking and
nicotine dependence with subsequent suicide idea-
tion (Table 3). It should be noted that even though
some of the control variables are highly intercorre-
lated, no evidence of multicollinearity can be found
using standard tests (that is, examination of the
condition number of the predictor variable covar-
iance, inspection for high negative correlations in the
coefficient variance­covariance matrix and compar-
ison of increases in the 95% CIs in the net models vs
the gross models). Although the sign pattern in the
net models holds up with the introduction of the
additional controls (88% of the ORs remain elevated),
none of these ORs is significant at the 0.05 level.
Furthermore, the dose­response pattern found in the
gross coefficients virtually disappears in the net
models. In the case of suicide plans, in comparison,
the sign pattern remains (88% of the ORs remain
elevated) and the proportion of ORs that are statisti-
cally significant (17%, 3/17) is the same as in the
gross models. Furthermore, some aspects of the
dose­response pattern continue to hold in the net
models, most notably the higher ORs associated with
early than later onsets of use, daily use and
dependence. Interestingly, the net coefficients are
more consistently elevated than the gross coefficients
in predicting suicide gestures, with 88% of the ORs
elevated, although none is statistically significant and
there is no evidence of a dose­response pattern in the
coefficients. Only a minority of the ORs in the net
models to predict suicide attempts, finally, is elevated
(11%, 2/17) and none is statistically significant.
Elaboration of the classification of smoking
involvement
We next created a more elaborate ordinal measure
designed to describe baseline smoking history in a
way that takes into consideration information con-
tained in all eight of the measures considered above.
This results in a six-category classification scheme in
which the lowest category consists of respondents
who never smoked and the highest of respondents
with a history of early-onset use, early-onset daily use
and early-onset dependence (Table 4). The two high-
est categories in this scheme are associated with
significantly elevated ORs of ideation in the gross
model. The highest category is associated with a
significantly elevated OR of plans in the gross model.
None of the categories, though, is significantly
associated with either gestures or attempts in the
gross models.
The situation is different in the net models. In the
case of ideation, the significant ORs disappear
entirely in the net model and no dose­response
relationship can be seen in the set of ORs as a whole.
In the case of plans, the significant OR associated
with the highest category of involvement (3.0) is
unchanged from the gross effects model. In the case of
gestures, each OR associated with any of the smoking
categories becomes elevated compared to the never-
smoked comparison group in the net model. These
ORs are in the range 1.7­2.0, but there is no dose­
response relationship and none of these ORs is
statistically significant. In light of this consistently
elevated set of ORs, we might suspect that the
association is genuine rather than due to random
error. However, the pooled OR (95% CI in parentheses)

of 1.8 (0.7­4.9) is not statistically significant in a
model that makes a global contrast between respon-
dents who ever smoked (that is, pooling all the
smoking categories) vs those who never smoked. In
the case of attempts, finally, none of the ORs in the

is no dose­response pattern across the coefficients to

higher smoking involvement.

in explaining the association between early-onset

two revised versions of the net effects model to

controls for sociodemographics. One of the two
also includes controls for common causes (that is,

the baseline interview. Both ORs are significant,
but the OR for remitted dependence (3.9 (1.2­12.9))
is higher than the OR for active dependence (2.6
(1.1­6.0)), suggesting that the causal pathways linking
dependence with subsequent suicide plans are for
the most part not mediated by current tobacco
involvement.
Discussion
Four methodological limitations need to be noted in
evaluating the substantive meaning our results. First,
our predictors are limited by the fact that no
information was collected about smokeless tobacco
use or about quantity­frequency of smoking (for
example, number of cigarettes, cigars or pipes smoked
per day; number of years smoked). The prospective
associations found here might have been stronger if
the predictors had included these refinements. Sec-
ond, we did not consider the possibility that some
people who make suicide plans and attempts might
deny ever having suicide ideation, as the skip logic
used in our surveys only assessed plans and attempts
among respondents who reported a history of suicide
ideation. Third, we did not control for all DSM-IV
disorders. Nonaffective psychosis (NAP), for exam-
ple, was not included in the core NCS-R assessment.
Yet we know that both smoking44 and suicidality45 are
comparatively common among people with NAP.
Exclusion of NAP, then, presumably led to an over-
estimation of the net effects of smoking. Fourth,
although control data on history of preexisting mental
disorders and suicidality were gathered prospectively
in our two-wave panel survey, the measures in each
survey were based on retrospective reports. For
example, the aspect of baseline tobacco use most
strongly predictive of later SROs was early-onset
nicotine dependence, a measure that required
respondents to provide retrospective reports in the
baseline survey about their age when they first
experienced symptoms of dependence. Similarly,
the outcome measures required respondents to make
retrospective reports about the occurrence of SROs in
the decade since the baseline survey. Systematic
recall errors in these reports could have introduced
bias into our estimates of predictive associations.
Some indication that retrospective recall of smoking
history is likely to be unbiased comes from our
investigation of the fact that the detailed baseline
assessment of smoking history was obtained only
from the respondents in the Tobacco Supplement.
Our finding that the associations of baseline smoking
with subsequent SROs were equivalent in magnitude
whether smoking was assessed prospectively or
retrospectively argues against the existence of retro-
spective recall bias at least for this part of the
assessment of smoking history.
In the context of these limitations, we were able to
reproduce the same basic data pattern that has been
documented in previous prospective studies of
smoking and SROs: a significant time-lagged dose­
response association between smoking-related vari-
ables and subsequent SROs. The associations involving
suicide ideation disappeared when we introduced
controls for baseline risk factors. The conditional
association of the highest level of smoking involve-
ment (lifetime nicotine dependence with early ages of
onset of use, daily use and dependence) with suicide
plans among ideators, in comparison, remained
statistically significant even in a model that included
a comprehensive set of controls.
Several previous prospective epidemiological stu-
dies found, unlike us, that significant gross prospec-
tive associations between smoking and SROs
disappeared entirely after controlling for a series of
risk factors.15,17,18 The fact that we found at least one
of these associations to remain, between the highest
level of smoking involvement and subsequent suicide
plans, might be due to the fact that the smoking
variables in these earlier studies all measured use
rather than nicotine dependence, whereas the sig-
nificant net association in our study involved early-
onset nicotine dependence. Another possible expla-
nation for the difference between our result and the
results of these earlier studies is that our finding of a
significant net association is a chance finding due to
the fact that we examined associations between many
different measures of smoking and four different
measures of SROs. Replication of our finding that
early-onset nicotine dependence predicts suicide
plans among ideators is needed before we can reject
the hypothesis of chance association. It is also
noteworthy that one other previous prospective
epidemiological study found more consistent evi-
dence than we did of statistically significant effects of
smoking on SROs after controlling for risk factors.11
This difference might be due to the fact that the
controls used in that earlier study were much less
complete than those used here.
By using more refined measures of both smoking
and SROs than previous studies, we were able to
expand our understanding of these associations by
discovering that early-onset nicotine dependence is
the aspect of smoking most strongly predictive of
subsequent SROs and that suicide ideation and,
among ideators, suicide plans, are the only SROs
predicted. Importantly, neither suicide gestures
among ideators nor suicide attempts among ideators
were significantly predicted by any of the smoking-
related variables we considered. Significant uncondi-
tional time-lagged associations of smoking-related
variables with subsequent suicide gestures and
suicide attempts are, in fact, present in our data due
to the people who make suicide gestures and attempts
being a subset of the people who have suicide
ideation, but our decomposition of the SROs shows
that the significant associations are actually only with
ideation and plans. Previous research has shown that
other predictors of ideation differ from the condi-
tional predictors of attempts among ideators.46 The
predictive effects of smoking now have to be

conceptualized in terms of this emerging evidence of
differential effects.
Although, as noted above, some previous prospec-
tive studies15,17,18 showed, like us, that the association
between smoking and subsequent suicide ideation
can largely be explained by baseline risk factors, those
previous studies made no attempt to distinguish the
explanatory effects of common causes from the
mediating effects of controls that might have been
both consequences of smoking and determinants of
subsequent suicide ideation. Our decomposition of
these different types of effects is consequently
especially useful in showing that the subset of these
variables most reasonably conceptualized as common
causes account for more of the explanatory effect than
the variables that might, at least in part, be mediators.
This finding argues against the otherwise plausible
possibility that the significant gross effects documen-
ted here are due to causal associations of smoking-
related predictors that are mediated by intervening
mental disorders.
We found, in comparison, that our control variables
did not explain the statistically significant association
between early-onset nicotine dependence and subse-
quent suicide plans among ideators. Although this
failure might be seen as indirectly arguing that
nicotine dependence might have a causal effect on
suicide plans, the finding that remitted nicotine
dependence was as strong a predictor as active
nicotine dependence is inconsistent with this inter-
pretation. A more plausible interpretation in light of
this specification is that the determinants of nicotine
dependence, which are presumably indicated by
respondents having either active dependence or a
history of remitted dependence, rather than depen-
dence itself are the true causal factors. Our failure to
explain the association between baseline history of
early-onset dependence and subsequent suicide
plans, under this interpretation, might be seen as
due to the fact that we did not measure the actual
common causes of the two variables. It remains for
future research to determine what those common
causes might be, but it seems likely based on the
current results that smoking is not itself of causal
importance in this regard, at least in predicting SROs.
It is important to reiterate the caution in the
introduction, though, that the same results might
not hold in predicting suicide deaths, as only a small
fraction of the people who have SROs go on to
complete suicides and the predictive associations of
smoking with suicide deaths might go through
different causal pathways than those involving SROs.
