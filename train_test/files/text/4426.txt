Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to assess the efficacy of memantine in patients with
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
Methods: Thirty healthy controls and 45 patients diagnosed with aMCI based on the Petersen
criteria were classified into 3 groups. Group 1 comprised patients who received a single memantine
dose following examination (n ¼ 25), Group 2 comprised patients who did not receive memantine
treatment following examination (n ¼ 20), and Group 3 comprised healthy age-matched volunteers
(n ¼ 30). Neuropsychological testing was performed, and the response to memantine was
examined at baseline and at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. Single-photon emission computed tomography
was performed at baseline and at 48 weeks in patients who received memantine treatment.
Results: Memantine treatment significantly improved the symptoms of aMCI according to the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised vocabulary subtest, backward digit span, and Blessed
Dementia Rating Scale, all of which were recorded for the duration of the study.
Conclusion: These data indicate that patients with aMCI receiving memantine develop an
improved semantic memory compared with no treatment. Further studies including larger patient
cohorts are necessary to validate these findings.

Introduction
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined
as the transitional phase between normal
cognitive aging and dementia. This impair-
ment is common, and nearly 19.0% of
individuals aged >65 years are affected.
Compared with older individuals with
normal cognition, patients with MCI have
a three- to five-times higher risk of develop-
ing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Petersen's
criteria are frequently used to divide MCI
into two groups: the amnestic (aMCI) and
non-amnestic (naMCI) forms. Interestingly,
aMCI is associated with frequent memory
loss and progression to AD.1­3 However,
patients with naMCI develop memory loss
as well as other cognitive issues, including
Lewy body dementia. Both types can be
subcategorized; in the present study, how-
ever, we did not perform subcategorization
because of the limited sample size.4,5 While
the US Food and Drug Administration has
approved several medications for the treat-
ment of AD, no medications have been
approved for patients with MCI.6
The importance of the glutamatergic
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
in memory and learning processes is well
recognized. Memantine, a low-affinity non-
competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, is
the only glutamatergic drug approved for
the treatment of moderate to severe cogni-
tive symptoms of AD. Recent studies have
shown that memantine can also reduce the
levels of amyloid b peptides, which inhibit
the amyloid b oligomer and improve cogni-
tive performance.7,8 Memantine can usually
be used in addition to acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors in patients with AD9 Interestingly,
memantine treatment results in slight benefi-
cial effects on memory, activities of daily
living, and behavior.
We conducted a prospective open-label
study to test the hypothesis that the anti-
glutamatergic activity of memantine can
improve cognitive functioning. Patients
with aMCI were treated with and without
memantine and compared using neuro-
psychiatric tests and single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT).
Material and methods
Participants
The present study was a 48-week, open-label
extension study involving 45 patients diag-
nosed with aMCI and 30 healthy controls
who were consecutively examined at the
Memory and Dementia Outpatient Clinic
of our neurology department.
Volunteers who responded to the adver-
tisements for this study underwent a multi-
stage screening procedure. The inclusion
criteria were an age of >55 years (with the
exception of seven individuals aged 55­68
years); availability of an informant who
could provide information about the partici-
pant's daily function; absence of significant
underlying medical, neurological, or psychi-
atric illness; and willingness to participate in
the study procedures. All patients were
required to be either cognitively normal or
mildly impaired, but without dementia; that
is, they were required to have a Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) of either 0.0 or 0.5.
All patients with MCI experienced
memory that deviated from their previous
normal function. We based the diagnosis of
aMCI on the following criteria established
by the International Working Group on
Mild Cognitive Impairment10:
All participants were evaluated for
depression using the 15-item short version
of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),
in which a total score of >5 indicates
depression. Neuropsychological testing was
performed at baseline (week 0) and at 12, 24,
and 48 weeks.
In total, 75 participants were included in
the study (Group 1, n ¼ 25; Group 2, n ¼ 20;
Group 3, n ¼ 30). Group 1 comprised
patients diagnosed with aMCI who received
memantine. They initially received meman-
tine at 5 mg once daily, and this was
2054 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
increased weekly by 5 mg/day in divided
doses to a total dosage of 20 mg/day.
Group 2 comprised patients diagnosed with
aMCI who received no treatment. Group 3
comprised healthy controls without aMCI.
The exclusion criteria were as follows:
probable or possible AD; the presence of
other neurodegenerative conditions, such as
parkinsonian, frontal, vascular, or meta-
bolic dementia; a history or diagnosis of
other neurologic diseases, such as stroke or
hydrocephalus; a primary psychiatric diag-
nosis, such as depression or schizophrenia;
the presence of sedating medications at
the time of testing; and a metabolic or
systemic disorder that might influence cog-
nitive performance.
All participants underwent magnetic
resonance imaging or brain computed
tomography examinations, medical and
neurological examinations, and neuropsy-
chological testing by the same researchers.
The following laboratory tests for dementia
were requested: complete blood counts,
blood chemistry, serum vitamin B12 and
folic acid levels, thyroid function tests, and
syphilis serology.
SPECT was performed at baseline and at
48 weeks in patients receiving memantine
treatment.
Neuropsychological tests
The Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE)11 was applied to all patients and
controls by an experienced neurologist to
evaluate the status of cognitive decline. All
patients underwent neuropsychiatric evalu-
ation including the digit span (forward and
back), Wechsler Memory Scale subtests
(immediate word recall list, delayed word
recall, delayed word recognition, visual
copy, and visual memory),12 Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R)
vocabulary subtest, Boston Naming Test
(BNT),13 clock drawing test,14 verbal
fluency, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale
(BDRS),15 Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living scale,16,17 CDR,18 and GDS.19
The same person implemented the neuro-
psychological tests for all patients. Sessions
were conducted in the morning in a quiet
room and lasted for 45 to 60 minutes.
Perfusion SPECT imaging
Regional cerebral blood flow was studied at
baseline using SPECT. Patients received an
injection of technetium-99 m ethyl cysteinate
dimer and rested for 1 h in a quiet environ-
ment with their eyes closed. SPECT image
acquisitions were performed using a double-
head rotating gamma camera (Siemens)
equipped with a fan beam collimator.
SPECT was carried out at baseline and at
48 weeks in patients receiving memantine
treatment.
Semantic memory
WAIS-R, word list memory, and recall. Semantic
memory was assessed with the WAIS-R and
word list memory recall. Free recall and
recognition were assessed with a word list
comprising 10 unrelated concrete nouns.
Unit-weighted composite scores were com-
puted based on vocabulary and general
knowledge tasks.
Ethics statement
All patient examinations were conducted in
full compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
All patients were informed before providing
written consent, and the local ethics commit-
tee approved the research.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS for Windows 13.0 and Sigma Stat 3.1.
The Shapiro­Wilk test was used to verify
data normality assumptions. For normally
distributed data, the paired sample t-test and
Ilhan Algin et al. 2055
one-way analysis of variance were used
for further analyses. For non-normally dis-
tributed data, the Wilcoxon t-test and
Kruskal­Wallis test were used. For multiple
comparisons, Dunn's method and Tukey's
test were performed. A p-value of <0.05 was
considered significant.
Multiple linear regression analysis was
performed to identify independent associ-
ations of the cerebral SPECT values by
including the parameters correlated with
cerebral SPECT perfusion in the bivariate
analysis. Standardized b regression coeffi-
cients and their significance according to the
multiple linear regression analysis were
reported. A p-value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Demographic data of all participants,
including age, sex, educational status, and
hand dominance, are summarized in
Table 1. There was no significant difference
among the three groups.
No significant differences were observed
in any scores between Groups 1 and 2.
However, there was a significant difference
in the neuropsychiatric test scores between
the patient groups and control group.
At baseline, significant differences in calcu-
lation, word list memory-3, word list recall,
WAIS-R, backward digit span, and BDRS
scores were observed between the patient
and control groups (p < 0.05) (Table 2).
At week 12, Group 1 had significantly
improved scores on the MMSE, word list
memory-2, word list recall, BNT, and CDR
compared with Group 3. Improvement in
the MMSE score was observed in Group 1,
while no significant improvement was found
in Groups 2 and 3 compared with baseline.
Word list recall scores were increased in all
groups, especially Group 1. Interestingly, a
statistically significant advancement was
observed for the calculation scores in
Groups 1 and 2. The BNT and BDRS
scores were significantly improved only in
Group 1 (Table 3).
The MMSE scores were higher at week 24
than at week 12 in Groups 1 and 2. At week
24, Group 1 showed significantly higher
scores for word list memory-3, word list
recall, WAIS-R, backward digit span,
BDRS, and GDS compared with baseline.
Group 2 showed a statistically significant
decrease in verbal fluency scores at week 24
(Table 3).
At week 48, the significant increase in
the word list memory-3, word list recall,
WAIS-R, backward digit span, BDRS, and
GDS scores continued. No differences were
observed in the other test scores among the
three groups (Table 3).
Semantic memory composite Z-score
Z-scores were measured for the WAIS-R
and word list recall test, which were used
for semantic memory. The scores were

Correlation with SPECT perfusion
According to the results of the bivariate
analysis, semantic memory was significantly
associated with the right superior frontal
cortex (r ¼ 0.167, p ¼ 0.020), left superior
frontal cortex (r ¼ 0.165, p < 0.001), right
medial frontal cortex (r ¼ 0.224, p ¼ 0.002),
left medial frontal cortex (r ¼ 0.221,
p ¼ 0.024), right inferior frontal cortex
(r ¼ 0.211, p ¼ 0.024), left inferior frontal
cortex (r ¼ 0.218, p ¼ 0.023), right superior
parietal cortex (r ¼ 0.215, p ¼ 0.020), left
superior parietal cortex (r ¼ 0.224, p ¼
0.020), right inferior parietal cortex (r ¼
0.218, p ¼ 0.022), left inferior parietal
cortex (r ¼ 0.214, p ¼ 0.023), right superior
temporal cortex (r ¼ 0.184, p ¼ 0.020),
left superior temporal cortex (r ¼ 0.176,
p ¼ 0.020), right inferior temporal cortex
(r ¼ 0.189, p ¼ 0.011), and left inferior tem-
poral cortex (r ¼ 0.198, p ¼ 0.023). Multiple
linear regression analysis showed that the
semantic memory Z-score was significantly
associated with SPECT perfusion in the
right inferior temporal cortex (b ¼ 0.192,
p ¼ 0.010).
The multiple linear regression analysis
showed that the semantic memory Z-score
was significantly associated with SPECT
perfusion in the right inferior temporal
cortex (b ¼ 0.192, p ¼ 0.010).
A statistically significant difference was
found in the right inferior temporal cortex
(p ¼ 0.031) in SPECT performed at the
beginning of the study and at about
48 weeks in Group 1. This difference was
characterized by an increase in perfusion
around 48 weeks in these regions (Table 4).
No significant difference in cerebral perfu-
sion was observed between Groups 2 and 3
at the beginning of the study or at 48 weeks.

Discussion
A previous study showed that the rate of
progression to clinically diagnosable AD is
10% to 15% per year among persons who
meet the criteria for the aMCI, in contrast to
1% to 2% per year among normal elderly
persons.20 Early diagnosis is essential for
disease prevention and the development of
new treatment strategies. Detection of AD
at a very early time point would enable early
intervention and a timely start of therapy,
possibly preventing disease progression.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have long
accounted for a majority of the treat-
ments administered for MCI; this trend
follows the cholinergic hypotheses.21­23
Another approach that is widely accepted
(at least as widely accepted as the histo-
pathogenesis of AD) is the glutaminergic
hypothesis, which is related to the increased
effect of glutamate.24 The discovery that the
toxic effect of glutamatergic neurotransmis-
sion is present in the very early phases of the
disease brought modulatory treatments up

to date. In the present study, we examined
the effects of memantine on neuropsycho-
logical measures for aMCI, improvements
in which could be mediated by a neuron-
protective effect of memantine.
The current use of memantine aims to
treat cognitive and behavioral disorders in
patients with mild to moderately severe AD
and mild to moderate vascular dementia.
No pharmacological agents have obtained
regulatory approval for the treatment or
prevention of these disorders. A review of
published clinical trials indicated that early
treatment of hypertension, a risk factor for
stroke, reduces the risk of vascular dementia
and slows its progression.25 Because neur-
onal damage begins in the preclinical phase
of the disease, it is believed that neuron-
protective treatments should be initiated at
very early stages.
The enhancing effects of NMDA recep-
tor antagonists on cerebral blood flow
have been demonstrated in experimental
ischemic models. In a study of the efficacy
of memantine on neuroimaging, glucose
metabolism decreased to a lesser degree in
the memantine than placebo group.26­28
This finding supports the functional and
neuroprotective efficacy of memantine.
Increased perfusion in the posterior parietal
area, which affects attention and memory as
shown by cerebral SPECT studies, has been
observed in patients with AD treated with
donepezil. Studies using functional imaging
techniques have suggested that semantic
memory impairment, which occurs relatively
early in the course of AD, is caused by
neural degeneration in the areas of associ-
ation in the lateral and inferior temporal
regions.29,30
Currently, no drugs are specifically per-
mitted by the US Food and Drug
Administration for MCI.31 Because aMCI
may be associated with AD, drug therapies
targeting AD may be help to manage
MCI.32­34 In one study, the combined treat-
ment of galantamine and memantine had
cognitive benefits in the short term, and
cognitive decline occurred after discontinu-
ation of galantamine.35,36 Although various
studies have examined donepezil, rivastig-
mine, and galantamine alone or combination
with memantine, reliable data on the influ-
ence of memantine alone in the treatment of
aMCI are lacking.
In one related study involving 270 amne-
sic patients with MCI, Salloway et al.37
investigated the effectiveness of donepezil
on memory loss by comparison with a
placebo group. Although donepezil treat-
ment was not strong enough to affect pure
memory test scores (a primary scale of
efficacy), it had positive effects on attention,
concentration, and psychomotor speed.38,39
Other similar studies have suggested that
donepezil treatment improves logical
memory at week 24. In a study investigating
the role of galantamine in patients with
MCI, global rating scales improved and
ADAS-cog subscale scores decreased after
6 weeks at all dose levels.40 In another study
by Pelton et al.,41 35 patients received anti-
depressant and memantine treatment, which
was found to be effective on cognition. The
dementia conversion rate was significantly
lower than in the control group.
In the present study, the recognition,
word list memory and recall, WAIS vocabu-
lary subtest, BDRS, and GDS scores
differed between memantine-treated patients
and controls; these scores decreased until
they normalized at week 48. Similar results
were observed for the MMSE and glo-
bal assessment scale, for which the scores
in memantine-treated patients increased at
week 48 and the significant differences in the
scores between these patients and the con-
trols were no longer present. These results
suggest that 48 weeks of memantine treat-
ment improved patient functioning until
their scores were comparable with those of
the healthy controls, whereas this was not
the case for patients with untreated aMCI.
Indeed, no change was observed in the
2060 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
global cognitive and functional scales of the
patients with untreated aMCI. However, the
memory test results showed improvement.
The fact that fewer significant between-
group differences were apparent over time
between the patients not receiving meman-
tine and the control group suggests that
memory functions improved over time in the
former. We found that patients not treated
with memantine showed a deterioration of
the GDS score. Therefore, memantine may
reduce the risk of depression.
Semantic memory deficits are frequently
seen in patients with AD, even in the early
phase, but not necessarily in patients in the
predementia state, as in aMCI. In the present
study, we observed a significant improvement
in the WAIS-R, word list memory, and recall
test used to evaluate semantic memory at 48
weeks in patients who received memantine.
Memantine is a noncompetitive recep-
tor antagonist, and it delays the process
of dementia by preventing the patho-
logical activation of NMDA receptors.
Its neuroprotective effects have been dis-
played in various neurological disorders.
Importantly, memantine reportedly reduces
the release of proinflammatory factors in
activated microglia.42,43
In patients with aMCI, pathologic
damage first occurs in the medial temporal
structures, mainly the entorhinal cortex,
which causes episodic memory deficits.44
The present study showed a significant posi-
tive correlation between semantic memory
and SPECT perfusion of the right inferior
temporal region in patients receiving mem-
antine. This finding may be due to the
neuroprotective effects of memantine therapy
in patients with aMCI.
Ramaswamy et al.45 observed improve-
ment in memory, core symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder, and depression in
combat veterans with post-traumatic stress
disorder after open-label treatment with
memantine. One limitation of the present
study is the relatively small number of
participants. The low prevalence of aMCI
restricted our ability to include a greater
number of individuals. Another limitation is
the duration of the study. A longer-term
study would have allowed us to better
observe the efficacy of memantine and deter-
mine which patients did and did not develop
progression to AD or dementia.
We found a significant increase in the
WAIS vocabulary subtest score when evaluat-
ing language functions and semantic memory
in our study. SPECT revealed cerebral hyper-
perfusion in the right inferior temporal region
in the memantine-treated patients before and
48 weeks after the start of treatment.
In conclusion, neuropsychological tests
and cerebral SPECT imaging showed that
memantine may be effective in improving the
semantic memory of patients with aMCI.
Memantine may inhibit oxidative stress and
inflammation during the early stage of the
disease. The optimal treatment for patients
with MCI is controversial. Importantly,
however, our study has shown that meman-
tine can be used for initial therapy of MCI.
Future studies should further investigate this
topic by including greater sample sizes and
performing long-term follow-up.
