Abstract
Objective: The effectiveness of axillary brachial plexus block (ABPB) performed using peripheral
nerve stimulation (PNS) alone was compared with PNS preceded by nerve localization using a pen
device, enabling nerve mapping without puncturing the skin.
Methods: Patients undergoing unilateral hand or forearm surgery suitable for ABPB were
randomly assigned to receive either PNS alone (pen À group) or PNS preceded by nerve
localization using a pen device (pen þ group). Parameters related to the block procedure and
patient comfort were assessed.
Results: Thirty patients were included in each group. The block performance time was longer in
the pen þ group than the pen À group despite a reduced number of needle insertions. The
complete block rate was higher and intraoperative analgesic usage lower in the pen þ group
compared with the pen À group. Patient satisfaction and complication rates were similar in the two
groups.
Conclusion: The pen device seems to be a helpful addition to PNS for ABPB, with improved
results in terms of block success and patient comfort, but further studies are needed to confirm
these findings.

axilla makes the target nerves more reliably
and easily reachable and this method is
readily accepted by the patient.1,2
The use of a pen device for nerve local-
ization in axillary brachial plexus block
(ABPB) has become accepted in anaesthesia
practice, but little has been published con-
cerning its efficacy. This device connects to a
peripheral nerve stimulator, enabling nerve
mapping without puncturing the skin
(Figure 1).
In this prospective study, ABPB was
performed using peripheral nerve stimula-
tion (PNS) alone or preceded by nerve
localization with a pen device. The two
procedures were compared in terms of the
block success rate, block performance time,
number of needle insertions and reposition-
ings, complications and patient comfort.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients undergoing unilateral hand or fore-
arm surgery suitable for ABPB at the
Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz University,
Antalya, Turkey, over a period of 8 months
between October and May 2011 who were
aged between 18 and 65 years and who had
an American Society of Anesthesiologists
(ASA) status of class I­III were enrolled.
Patients who were not suitable for regional
anaesthesia were excluded from the study.
The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
Akdeniz University, and written consent
was obtained from all study participants.
Patients were premedicated with 1 mg
intravenous midazolam. Arterial blood
pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram and
peripheral oxygen saturation were moni-
tored throughout the procedure. Patients
were randomly divided using a sealed enve-
lope system into two groups to receive PNS
via an inserted needle either alone
(pen À group) or preceded by nerve localiza-
tion using a pen device (pen þ group).
Procedure in the pen À group
The arm to be operated on was positioned at
90 abduction with the forearm at 90
flexion. The axilla was cleaned with povi-
done­iodine. Following infiltration of 30 mg
lidocaine subcutaneously to provide skin
anaesthesia in the area where the block
was to be performed, the axillary artery
was palpated. A 50 mm StimuplexÕ needle
connected to a StimuplexÕ nerve stimulator
(B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was
inserted through the skin and subcutaneous
tissue alongside the artery. Electrical stimu-
lation at 2 Hz and 2 mA was applied to the
needle. Muscle contractions in the forearm,
hand and fingers (stimulated by the muscu-
locutaneous) were observed and the needle
repositioned until movements associated
with the particular nerve to be blocked
were seen. When stimulation of the needle
produced the most powerful contractions,
the current was reduced to 0.5 mA. If the
contractions ceased, the needle was repos-
itioned until muscle contractions occurred at
the lower current levels. Confirmation was
obtained that the needle was not inside a
blood vessel by negative aspiration. Then
70 mg lidocaine was injected via the needle,
followed by 150 mg bupivacaine 0.5% in

(single injection technique).
Procedure in the pen þ group
The arm to be operated on was positioned
and the axilla prepared as for the
pen À group. The pen device (StimuplexÕ
pen, B Braun) was placed in a sterile bag and
connected to the StimuplexÕ nerve stimula-
tor. The pen device was held like a pen in the
operator's hand and the end of the device
was placed on the skin. After palpation of
the axillary artery, electrical stimulation at
2 Hz and 5 mA was applied to the pen device
as it was moved across the skin above the
artery. Muscle contractions in the forearm,
hand and fingers (stimulated by the muscu-
locutaneous) were observed and the pen
device repositioned until movements asso-
ciated with the particular nerve to be
blocked were seen. When stimulation of the
pen device produced the most powerful
contractions, the current was reduced to
2 mA. If the contractions ceased, the
pen device was repositioned until muscle
contractions were seen at the lower current
level. The position of the pen device
was marked on the skin using a sterile
marker pen.
The pen device was then disconnected
from the nerve stimulator and a 50 mm
StimuplexÕ needle was connected in its
place. The needle was inserted through the
skin and subcutaneous tissue at the position
marked. Electrical stimulation at 2 Hz and
2 mA was applied to the needle. Muscle
contractions in the forearm, hand and fin-
gers were observed and the needle repos-
itioned until movements associated with the
particular nerve to be blocked were seen.
When stimulation of the needle produced
the most powerful contractions, the current
was reduced to 0.5 mA. If the contractions
ceased, the needle was repositioned until
muscle contractions occurred at the lower
current levels. Confirmation was obtained
that the needle was not inside a blood vessel
by negative aspiration. Then 70 mg lidocaine
was injected via the needle, followed by
150 mg bupivacaine 0.5% in 10 ml normal
saline (total volume 40 ml) (single injection
technique).
Assessment of procedure
The block performance time, defined as the
time between palpation of the axillary artery
to the time when the needle was removed,
was measured by an assistant using a
chronograph. In addition, the total number
of times the needle was withdrawn through
the skin (needle insertion count) or repos-
itioned without withdrawal (needle passage
count), the duration of the operation, and
the need for any additional intraoperative
sedation or local anaesthesia to the surgical
area were recorded by the anaesthetist, who
was not blinded to the procesure.
Evaluation of block success
To assess sensory block in the operation
area, a pinprick test on all four terminal
branch areas was conducted every 5 min
following the injection of local anaesthesia.
The result was scored on a scale from 0 to 2,
where 2 represented total loss of both pain
and touch (complete block), 1 represented
loss of pain but not touch (partial block),
and 0 represented persistence of both pain
and touch (no block).
A modified Bromage scale3 was used to
perform motor block assessment every 5 min
following the injection of local anaesthesia.
The result was scored on a scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 represented absence of movement in
the upper extremity, 1 represented the pres-
ence of movement in the fingers only, 2
represented the presence of flexion in the
wrist, and 3 represented the presence of
flexion in the elbow.
When indicated by a partial sensory
block score 1, a motor block score 1 or if

the patient became irritable, additional
intravenous sedation was given consisting
of an initial bolus of 50 mg of fentanyl
followed by a 1 mg bolus of midazolam if
required. In patients who continued to suffer
from pain despite receiving more than two
doses of both sedative drugs plus subcuta-
neous prilocaine to the surgical area, the
block was deemed to be unsuccessful and
general anaesthesia was commenced via a
laryngeal mask (Table 1). These patients
were excluded from the study.
Overall block success was defined in
terms of the need for additional intravenous
sedation or local anaesthesia to the surgical
area. No requirement for additional intra-
venous sedation or local anaesthesia was
defined as complete block success and was
assigned a score of 0. The need for add-
itional sedation was assigned a score of 1,
and the need for additional local anaesthesia
and additional sedation was assigned a score
of 2; a score of 1 or 2 was defined as assisted
block success.
In addition, the need for intraoperative
analgesia (50 mg fentanyl intravenously) was
scored at 60 and 90 min from the beginning
of the block procedure, with the absence of
analgesic use being assigned a score of 0, use
of a single dose of analgesic being assigned a
score of 1, and use of two doses of analgesic
being assigned a score of 2.
Evaluation of pain
Pain in the surgical area and pain related to
the block procedure were evaluated using a
visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1
to 10.
To assess pain in the surgical area,
patients were asked to score the pain
before commencing the surgical procedure,
at 5 min and 10 min following local anaes-
thesia administration for axillary block, at
10 min intervals for 1 h during surgery, then
at 30 min intervals for 150 min, and at the
end of the operation.
To assess pain related to the block per-
formance, patients were asked to score the
pain felt in the axilla due to needle entry and
drug administration.
Patient satisfaction and complications
At the end of the operation, all patients were
asked whether or not they would be happy
to undergo the same anaesthesia procedure
again in the future.
Vascular complications (arterial or
venous puncture), neurological complica-
tions, complications in the injection area
(haematoma or infection), local anaesthetic
toxicity/allergic reactions and any other
complications were recorded.
Statistical analyses
For our sample size (n ¼ 30 in each group),
with a significance level of 0.05 and effect
size of 0.55, post hoc analysis showed a
power of 0.73. Results were expressed as
frequencies, percentages or means Æ SD.
Pearson's 2 or Fisher's exact test were
used to establish relationships between

categorical data, the Mann­Whitney U-test
or Student's t-test were used to analyse
differences between independent measure-
ments, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test
was used in the analysis of differences
between measurements recorded at different
times. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS software version 18.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value of
<0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 60 patients were randomly
allocated to the pen À group (n ¼ 30) or the
pen þ group (n ¼ 30). There were no statis-
tical differences between the groups in terms
of age, sex, body mass index or duration of
operation (Table 2). In addition, there were
no statistical differences in blood pressure,
heart rate or oxygen saturation between the
groups nor any statistical change in these
parameters within each group pre- and
postoperatively (data not shown).
Block performance times, needle inser-
tion counts and needle passage counts are
shown in Table 3. Overall block success in
the two groups is shown in Table 4.
Complete block occurred significantly
more frequently in the pen þ group com-
pared with the pen À group (P ¼ 0.007). In
the pen À group, of the patients with partial
sensory block at 15 min, 53.8% had devel-
oped complete sensory block by 30 min; in
addition, sensory block scores associated
with radial block appeared to settle more
quickly than those associated with blockade
of the other brachial plexus nerves (data not
shown). However, these differences were not
taken into consideration when assessing
overall block success.
The need for intraoperative analgesia
assessed at 60 and 90 min in the two
groups is shown in Table 5. Significantly
fewer patients required intraoperative anal-
gesia at 60 min in the pen þ group than in
the pen À group (P ¼ 0.019). This time point
is of particular interest in evaluating anaes-
thetic success as it represents the time at
which the planned surgical intervention is
likely to occur following performance of the
axillary block and the completion of other
preparations. There was no statistical differ-
ence between the groups at 90 min.
When compared using the Student's t-
test, there was no significant difference in the
preoperative VAS score for pain in the
surgical area between the two groups.
After 60 min, the VAS score had decreased
significantly compared with the preoperative
value in both groups (Table 6), but there was
no significant difference between the two
groups. In addition, there were no signifi-
cant differences in VAS scores for pain in the
surgical area at all other time points (data
not shown).
When compared using the Mann­
Whitney U-test, there was no significant
difference in the VAS score for pain in the

of patients who would be happy to undergo
the same anaesthesia procedure again in the
future was not significantly different in the
two groups (28/30 in the pen þ groups vs 23/

were observed in either group.
Discussion
Brachial plexus block is a frequently used
method of regional anaesthesia. Blocking
the brachial plexus in the axilla was first
reported by Halsted in 18844 and its clinical
use was described by Hirschel5 in 1911. Its
popularity grew following the publication of
an article by Burnham6 in 1959.
Ultrasonography gives the opportunity
to observe the contents of the axilla for more
accurate positioning of the needle and local
anaesthetic distribution, increasing block
quality and decreasing the amount of local
anaesthetic required.2,7,8 However, ultrason-
ography is not always available in operating
rooms.9 The use of peripheral nerve stimu-
lation for nerve localization was first
reported in the 1950s.10,11 This method is
invasive and may require multiple needle
passages in order to obtain the desired
motor or sensory response to electrical
stimulation. In a study by Casati et al.12
involving 60 patients, ABPB carried out
using ultrasonography or PNS for nerve
localization was compared in terms of the
time to block onset, block success, proce-
dure-related pain and patient satisfaction;

both methods had similar success rates,
patient satisfaction and complication rates.
Koscielniak-Nielsen et al.13 reported that
pain scores at the time of multiple needle
passages were lower than those associated
with electrical stimulation or anaesthetic
injection. On the other hand, Bloc et al.14
demonstrated that ultrasonography-guided
methods were associated with greater
patient satisfaction and comfort than PNS.
In the present study, ABPB performed
using PNS preceded by nerve localization
with a pen device was compared with PNS
alone. A number of articles have shown that
pain at the time of peripheral nerve block is
mostly associated with multiple electroloca-
lizations or injections.15­17 Sia et al.18
reported that the cause of major pain at
the time of the procedure was the with-
drawal and repositioning of the needle,
whereas Standl and Burmeister19 correlated
patient dissatisfaction with repeated muscle
contractions and needle movements. In a
study of peripheral block performed on 3996
patients using PNS, a high success rate of up
to 94% was obtained; however, 74% of the
patients said that they would prefer a differ-
ent anaesthetic method next time, mainly
due to discomfort during performance of the
block.20 In the present study, the needle
insertion count was significantly lower in
the pen þ group compared with the
pen À group.
During nerve localization in PNS, the
needle may need to be repositioned many
times. Repeated insertion and withdrawal of
the stimulation needle and its repositioning
in the subcutaneous tissue may alter the pain
resistance of the patient and additional
analgesia/sedation may be necessary during

the procedure.12 In the present study, there
was a significantly smaller needle insertion
count and a significantly decreased need for
intraoperative analgesia in the pen þ group.
Further studies are needed to compare the
effects of non-invasive methods such as the
pen device and ultrasonography with those
of PNS on patient satisfaction.
In a review by De Andre
´ s and Sala-
Blanch21 that compared PNS with other
methods, it was reported that nerve stimu-
lation was not superior to other nerve local-
ization methods despite its numerous
advantages. In a study by Goldberg et al.,22
the techniques of transarterial fixation, par-
aesthesia and nerve stimulation were com-
pared and shown to have similar success
rates. However, only single doses of anaes-
thesia were used, whereas multiple injections
may have been more suitable.23 In a study by
Baranowski and Pither24 comparing ABPB
using multiple injections guided by nerve
stimulation or paraesthesia, no difference in
success rates was found between these tech-
niques. However, the number of patients in
the PNS group was low and there were
variations in the number of nerves detected.23
In contrast, a study of 100 patients comparing
multiple injections guided by nerve stimula-
tion or paraesthesia reported shorter per-
formance times, faster onset times and higher
complete block rates, particularly in the
radial and musculocutaneous nerves, in the
neurostimulation group.18 In the present
study, complete block rates approaching
50% were obtained in the penÀ group, with
higher rates of 80% in the pen þ group.
Although there is a theoretical risk of
needle trauma to nerves in ABPB, a number
of studies have reported either no neuro-
logical complications15,25 or low rates of
temporary neurological dysfunction.20,26
Therefore, it seems that the use of stimula-
tion needles is not associated with increased
nerve damage. In the present study, no nerve
damage was observed in either group. A
small number of arterial and venous
punctures occurred, but the rate of vascular
complications was not significantly different
in the two groups. However, ultrasonog-
raphy has been shown to superior to PNS in
terms of vascular complications.27
In contrast to studies that have compared
different nerve identification methods, the
present study used the same fundamental
approach in both groups (PNS) but this was
facilitated by use of the pen device in the
pen þ group. As the pen device is a recent
development, very little has yet been pub-
lished concerning its use. However, there are
a number of studies of ABPB conducted
using other types of percutaneous electrode
guidance (PEG) that resemble the pen device
in that they are simple and non-invasive.
The use of modified electrocardiography
electrodes or isolated needles has been
shown to decrease the needle exploration
time and needle passage count and to reduce
procedure-related pain.28,29 The success rate
of block performed following PEG using an
insulated needle was reported as >85% by
Capdevila et al.9 This is similar to the block
success rate of 80% using the pen device in
the present study.
These studies with PEG suggest that
supporting techniques such as the pen
device used in the present study could
improve results in terms of block perform-
ance time and patient satisfaction. However,
Wegener et al.30 have suggested that the pen
device is not a reliable method compared
with high-resolution ultrasonography for
nerve localization. Theoretically, the pen
device works on the principle that the
threshold current needed to stimulate the
nerve is dependent on the distance from
the electrode to the nerve.31 However, since
electrical resistance in biological tissues
demonstrates variability,32,33 this correl-
ation is not always linear.34 Thus the pen
device is unlikely to be able to provide
localization information as reliably as a
method that generates real-time images
such as ultrasonography.
344 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
The results of the present study, together
with those reported in the literature for
other types of PEG, suggest that use of the
pen device can increase block success with
PNS. However, further clinical studies with
a greater number of subjects are needed to
confirm these findings.
