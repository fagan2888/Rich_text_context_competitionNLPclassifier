Context.--Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, is a marker of exposure to tobacco
smoke. Previous studies suggest that non-Hispanic blacks have higher levels of se-
rumcotininethannon-Hispanicwhiteswhoreportsimilarlevelsofcigarettesmoking.
Objective.--To investigate differences in levels of serum cotinine in black, white,
and Mexican American cigarette smokers in the US adult population.
Design.--Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1991.
Participants.--A nationally representative sample of persons aged 17 years or
older who participated in the survey.
Outcome Measures.--Serum cotinine levels by reported number of cigarettes
smoked per day and by race and ethnicity.
Results.--A total of 7182 subjects were involved in the study; 2136 subjects re-
ported smoking at least 1 cigarette in the last 5 days. Black smokers had cotinine
concentrations substantially higher at all levels of cigarette smoking than did white
or Mexican American smokers (P.001). Serum cotinine levels for blacks were
125 nmol/L (22 ng/mL) (95% confidence interval [CI], 79-176 nmol/L [14-31 ng/mL])
to 539 nmol/L (95 ng/mL) (95% CI, 289-630 nmol/L [51-111 ng/mL]) higher than
for whites and 136 nmol/L (24 ng/mL) (95% CI, 85-182 nmol/L [15-32 ng/mL]) to
641 nmol/L (113 ng/mL) (95% CI, 386-897 nmol/L [68-158 ng/mL]) higher than for
Mexican Americans. These differences do not appear to be attributable to
differences in environmental tobacco smoke exposure or in number of cigarettes
smoked.
Conclusions.--To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence from a
national study that serum cotinine levels are higher among black smokers than
among white or Mexican American smokers. If higher cotinine levels among blacks
indicate higher nicotine intake or differential pharmacokinetics and possibly serve
as a marker of higher exposure to cigarette carcinogenic components, they may
help explain why blacks find it harder to quit and are more likely to experience higher
rates of lung cancer than white smokers.

THE BIOCHEMICAL measurement of
serumcotinine,theprimarymetaboliteof
nicotine, is widely applied as a marker of
bothtobaccouseandexposuretoenviron-
mental tobacco smoke (ETS). Previous
studies1-4 have suggested that non-His-
panic blacks have higher levels of serum
cotininethandonon-Hispanicwhiteswho
reportsimilarlevelsofcigarettesmoking.
The interpretation of the results in these
studies has been subject to debate, how-
ever.3,5-8 Some researchers3,6,7 have sug-
gested that differences between levels
of serum cotinine in non-Hispanic black
smokers and non-Hispanic white smok-
ers are attributable, at least in part, to
racial differences in nicotine metabolism
or elimination. Others5 believe that such
differences are attributable to other vari-
ables, including differences in the type
of cigarette smoked (length of cigarette,
mentholornonmenthol,filterornonfilter,
and nicotine yield) and differences in how
the cigarettes are smoked (blocking ven-
tilation holes by fingers or lips, frequency
and depth of inhalation, retention time of
smoke in the lungs, and percentage of
available tobacco smoked). Serum coti-
nine differences by race have also been
attributed to differences in the accuracy
of cigarette smoking self-reports2,9-12 and
to differences in exposure to ETS.4,13,14
See also pp 152 and 179.
Cotinine is widely applied as a marker
of both tobacco use and exposure to en-
vironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) be-
cause it has a longer half-life (average, 18
to 20 hours) than nicotine does (average,
2 to 3 hours). On average, a cigarette
smokerabsorbsabout1mgofnicotineper
cigarette smoked.15,16 The increment in
blood nicotine concentration after smok-
ing a single cigarette ranges from 0.031
to 0.185 µmol/L (5-30 ng/mL), depending
onhowthecigaretteissmoked.17-19 Anav-
erage of 70% to 80% of the nicotine ab-
sorbed is metabolized to cotinine.16,20-23
In adult smokers, a nicotine intake of
approximately 1 mg can be estimated
from a blood cotinine level of 71 nmol/L
(12.5 ng/mL) using a conversion factor of
0.08 mg/24 h per nanogram per milliliter
under steady-state conditions.14 The co-

Scientists at the National Center for
EnvironmentalHealthoftheCentersfor
DiseaseControlandPreventionrecently
developed a new, highly sensitive bio-
chemical measurement method for de-
tecting levels of serum cotinine as low as
0.3 nmol/L (0.05 ng/mL). Using the new
method, we investigated racial and eth-
nic differences in serum cotinine levels.
We obtained data on serum cotinine lev-
els from a representative sample of adult
smokersandnonsmokersofthethirdNa-
tionalHealthandNutritionExamination
Survey (NHANES III), a nationwide
household collection of health and nutri-
tional information from a representative
sample of the US civilian, noninstitution-
alized population aged 2 months or older.
METHODS
The NHANES III, conducted from
1988 to 1994, consisted of a number of
questionnaires performed in the house-
hold followed by standardized physical
examinations and additional tobacco use
questions administered in specially
equipped mobile examination centers
(MECs). We used NHANES III phase 1
datacollectedbetweenOctober25,1988,
and October 21, 1991, because the data
for some of the key variables for the
analyses were available for only this 3-
year period. The nationally representa-
tive sample of the eligible population
surveyed during phase 1 permitted cal-
culation of national estimates.
Subjects and Demographics
Our study sample was limited to par-
ticipants aged 17 years or older who de-
scribed themselves as non-Hispanic
blacks, non-Hispanic whites, or Mexican
Americans, who had a serum cotinine
measurement and provided tobacco use
information in the MEC, and who did not
use any other significant sources of nico-
tine in the previous 5 days. Of the 12 391
persons selected, 2271 refused the inter-
view; 1315 were interviewed at home and
didnotvisittheMECs;281didnotanswer
the MEC tobacco questionnaire; 682 had
no cotinine measurement; 434 reported
using other significant sources of nicotine
intheprevious5days;and226wereother
than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican American. Data from
2136 subjects who reported smoking 1
cigarette or more in the past 5 days were
includedintheanalyses.Oneoftheanaly-
ses included data from both smokers and
nonsmokers (n = 7182).
Raceandethnicitybasedonself-report
were categorized as non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic white (henceforth referred
to as blacks and whites), and Mexican
American. Age at interview was catego-
rized as 17 to 24, 25 to 44, 45 to 64, or 65 or
moreyears.Educationallevelwascatego-
rized as 0 to 8, 9 to 11, 12, or 13 or more
completed years of schooling. Poverty
statuswasbasedonameasuredeveloped
by the US Bureau of the Census. Mem-
bersoffamilieswhoseincomeswereequal
to or greater than poverty thresholds
were categorized as "at or above poverty
level"; those with family incomes below
the poverty threshold, as "below poverty
level." Each subject's weight in kilo-
grams,measuredusingadigitalscale,was
categorized as less than 60, 60 to 69.99, 70
to 79.99, and 80 kg or more.
Reported exposure to ETS at home
was based on the following questions
posed to 1 member of the household (usu-
ally the head of the family or spouse of
the head): "Does anyone who lives here
smokecigarettesinthehome?"Whenthe
answerwasyes,theintervieweewasthen
asked: "Who?" When any household
member smoked, each member of that
householdwasclassifiedasbeingexposed
toETSathome.Thenumberofhousehold
memberswhosmokedwascategorizedas
0, 1, or 2 or more. In addition, one of the
family members was asked how many
rooms were in the home, excluding bath-
rooms. The number of rooms in the home
was categorized as 1 to 4 or 5 or more.
Persons aged 17 years or older who re-
ported having a job or business were also
askedhowmanyhoursperdaytheywere
close enough to tobacco smoke at work
thattheycouldsmellthesmoke.Thenum-
ber of hours exposed to ETS at work was
categorized as 0, 1 to 3, or 4 or more. Data
werealsocategorizedbyregionasNorth-
east, North Central, South, or West, ac-
cording to standard US Bureau of the
Census definitions.
The MEC tobacco questionnaire asked
participants: "How many cigarettes have
yousmokedinthepast5days?"Asmoker
was defined as a person who reported
smoking 1 cigarette or more during the
previous 5 days. The average number of
cigarettessmokedperdaywascalculated
and used for the analyses.
Serum Cotinine Measurement
Biochemical determination of tobacco
exposurewasperformedbymeasuringse-
rumcotininelevelsinbloodspecimensob-
tained by venipuncture in the MEC. The
cotinine assay involved isotope dilution,
liquid chromatography, and tandem mass
spectrometry.24 As in the study by Pirkle
and colleagues,13 we used cutoff points of
higher than 85 nmol/L (15 ng/mL) and 85
nmol/L (15 ng/mL) or less of cotinine in
serum to designate active tobacco users
and nontobacco users, respectively.
Cotinine data were originally re-
ported in nanograms per milliliter. A
conversionfactorof5.67wasusedtocon-
vert cotinine levels in nanograms per
milliliter to cotinine levels in nanomoles
perliter,basedonamolecularweightfor
cotinine of 176.22. A conversion factor of
0.006 was used to convert nicotine levels
previously reported in nanograms per
milliliter to nicotine levels in micro-
moles/liter, based on a molecular weight
for nicotine of 162.23.
Statistical Analysis
Determinationofserumcotininelevels
by race and ethnicity involved fitting a
series of nonlinear exponential regres-
sion models of the form: ln(cotinine)
= 0

O) + error,whereln(co-
tinine) is the natural logarithm of serum
cotinine; O is the number of self-reported
cigarettes smoked per day; 0

, and 2
are parameters that describe the expo-
nential relationship; and error is the
residual error left unexplained by the
model.Thisexponentialmodelfacilitated
modeling serum cotinine as a monotoni-
callyincreasingfunctionofthenumberof
cigarettessmoked,withcotinineincreas-
ing at a decreasing rate toward an upper
asymptote. The variable 0
represents
the upper bound (maximum achievable
level) of ln(cotinine) at the highest levels
of daily smoking, and 2
represents the
rateatwhichcotinineincreaseswithcon-
sumption. The quantity (0

) repre-
sents the expected ln(cotinine) at a con-
sumption level of 0 cigarettes per day.
Priortomodelfitting,wedividedtheself-
reported number of cigarettes smoked in
the last 5 days by 5 and rounded to the
nearest integer. Therefore, in the model,
less than 1 represents a response of 1 to 4
cigarettes smoked in the last 5 days.

RESULTS
Study Population
Proportionately more black smokers
than white smokers were poor and
weighed 80 kg or more (Table 1). In
terms of sociodemographic character-
istics, Mexican American smokers dif-
feredfromotherracialandethnicgroups
of smokers more than either their white
or black counterparts.
Among self-reported smokers, both
blacksandwhiteshadserumcotininelev-
els consistent with their reported smok-
ing levels (Table 2). Therefore, among
blacks and whites, the ability of the bio-
chemicalmeasurementtodetectsmokers
and nonsmokers was similar. Self-re-
ported Mexican American smokers were
less likely than blacks or whites to have
serum cotinine levels consistent with
their reported smoking levels. Self-re-
ported nonsmokers (97.9% of blacks,
98.5% of whites, and 99.4% of Mexican
Americans) had biochemically assessed
cotinine threshold levels consistent with
their reported smoking levels.
Self-reported and biochemically as-
sessedsmokingprevalencesamongblacks
(34.9%and34.7%,respectively)weresimi-
lar to those for whites (33.1%, 32.1%) and
higher than Mexican Americans (27.0%,
20.1%) (results not shown). Although
blacks were as likely to have smoked in
the past 5 days as whites, they reported
smoking fewer cigarettes per day than
whites (Table 3). Mexican Americans
smokedfewercigarettesperdaythandid
either blacks or whites.
Statistics and Modeling
Fitting a nonlinear exponential unad-
justed regression model (Figure) to de-
termine the relationship between serum
cotinine levels and self-reported ciga-
rette smoking showed that cotinine con-
centrations were substantially higher
among black smokers than among white
or Mexican American smokers at all lev-
els of cigarette smoking. Whites and
Mexican Americans had similar serum
cotinine levels when they smoked up to 5
cigarettes per day, but serum cotinine
levels increased significantly more for
whites than for Mexican Americans with
each additional cigarette smoked. Serum

as education, poverty status, time of day

not significantly associated with serum
cotinine (data not shown). These vari-
ables were excluded from the final model
in this study.

COMMENT
This study provides the first evidence
from a national study that black smokers
havehigherserumcotininelevelsthando
white or Mexican American smokers, af-
ter adjustment for the number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day, age, sex, body
weight, number of smokers living in the
home, and number of hours exposed at
worktoETS.Ourfindingisconsistentwith
the results of previous smaller studies1-4
that have found that blacks have higher
serum cotinine levels than whites do at
similarlevelsofself-reportedsmoking,but
differsfromthatof1previousreport12 sug-
gesting that Mexican Americans derive
morecotininepercigarettethanwhitesdo.
The analysis in our study was limited
bythelackofdataonthetypeofcigarette
smoked (eg, menthol vs regular or filter
vs nonfilter), smoking topography (eg,
depth of inhalation or vent blocking),
or nicotine pharmacokinetics. Previous
studies have assessed the contribution of
some of these factors (eg, the use of men-
tholatedornonmentholatedcigarettes)to
serum cotinine levels among black smok-
ers and white smokers. Some of these
studies1,26-28 have reported that smokers
of mentholated cigarettes have higher
levels of serum cotinine than smokers
of nonmentholated cigarettes; others3,29
have reported no significant differences.
Moreblacks(76%)thanwhites(23%)pre-
fer mentholated cigarettes.30,31
In a study of 5115 young adults,3 Wa-
genknecht and colleagues found that the
effect of mentholation on serum cotinine
levels was 188 nmol/L (33.2 ng/mL) for
black smokers and 20 nmol/L (3.6 ng/mL)
forwhitesmokers;neitherdifferencewas
statistically significant. The authors con-
cluded that higher serum cotinine levels
in black smokers of mentholated ciga-
rettes explained part but not all of the ra-
cial difference in serum cotinine levels. In
addition to considering the mentholation
of cigarettes, these authors adjusted the
results for nicotine content of the ciga-
rette,inhalationfrequency,howfarsmok-
ers let their cigarette burn when they
smoked, and weekly exposure to side-
stream smoke from the burning end of a
cigarette. The serum levels of thiocya-
nate, a metabolite of cyanide that reflects
exposure to tobacco smoke, were similar
for the groups when the results were ad-
justed for the number of cigarettes
smoked per day. This finding suggests
that the higher cotinine levels found
amongblackswerenottheresultofinhal-
ing more smoke than whites do.7
Serum cotinine differences between
blacksmokersandwhitesmokershavealso
been suggested to be attributable to dif-
ferential reports of the number of ciga-
rettes smoked. Although we did not mea-
surethevalidityofthestudyparticipants'
self-reports,wefoundnodifferencesinthe
reliability of self-reports among blacks,
whites, and Mexican Americans. Clark
andcolleagues8 designedastudytodeter-
mine differences in cigarette smoking re-
ports between 66 blacks and 97 whites.
Theycollectedinformationaboutthenico-
tinecontentofthecigarette,inhalationfre-
quency, how far smokers let their ciga-
rettes burn when they smoked, and if the
cigarettes were menthol or nonmenthol.
They even measured the lengths of ciga-
rette butts, which were collected for a
week. Clark et al found no evidence that

tion occurred more often in black than in
whitesmokersandsignificantlyhigherse-

They concluded that the disproportion-
atelyhighcotininelevelsobservedintheir
study among blacks could not be attrib-
utedtoreportingerror.Thisresultiscon-
sistent with our findings. If the study by
Clark et al can be generalized to the US
population, it seems unlikely that report-
ing differences biased our results.
Wealsoconsidereddifferencesinself-
reported exposure to ETS between the
3 racial and ethnic groups. Even after
adjustment of the results for number of
smokers living in the home, number of
hours of ETS exposure at work, number
of rooms in the home, and region of the
countrywheretheparticipantslived,the
differences in the relationships between
serum cotinine level and self-reported
cigarette consumption for the 3 racial
groups remained statistically signifi-
cant. A limitation of this measure, how-
ever, is that it relies on self-reports, not
a precise ETS measurement. On the
otherhand,chamberstudyresults32 sug-
gest that the ETS exposure generated
by smokers smoking 10 different brands
of US cigarettes is similar, thus provid-
ing no basis for believing differential
brand exposure could account for differ-
encesobservedbetweenblackandwhite
or Mexican American smokers.
Our results documenting differences
betweentheserumcotininelevelsofblack
smokers and white smokers are consis-
tent with results4,13,33-35 documenting dif-
ferencesinserumcotininelevelsbetween
blacknonsmokersandwhitenonsmokers.
In these reports, blacks had higher coti-
nine levels than whites, even after ETS
exposure and other factors were taken
into account. For example, after adjust-
ing for self-reported levels of ETS expo-
sure,Pirkleandcolleagues13 foundhigher
cotinine levels for blacks than for whites
or Mexican Americans among persons
aged 17 years or older.
Resultsfromourstudysuggestthatdif-
ferences in serum cotinine levels be-
tween blacks and whites cannot be ex-
plained by differences in reporting the
number of cigarettes smoked or differ-
ences in ETS exposure. The differences
may be influenced by group-specific pat-
ternsofsmokingbehaviorandmayalsobe
influencedbydifferencesinnicotinephar-
macokinetics and brand mentholation.
Further research is needed to clarify
the relationship between smoking prac-
tices and serum cotinine levels in ethnic
groups in the United States. Although
there is no definitive explanation why
blacksmokershavehigherserumcotinine
levels than both whites and Mexican
Americans, this finding is intriguing for 2
reasons:(1)blacksmokersaremorelikely
totrytoquitbuthavealowersuccessrate
thanwhitesmokers,36 and(2)blacksinthe
United States are at higher risk than
whites of developing and dying from lung
cancer.37 Whether higher serum cotinine
concentrations contribute to higher rates
of nicotine addiction among blacks than
whites is unknown. If higher serum coti-
nine levels serve as a marker of higher
nicotine intake and absorption, they may
help explain the lower quitting success
rateamongblacksmokerscomparedwith
white smokers. If higher serum cotinine
levels serve as a marker of higher expo-
sure to other cigarette components such
as carcinogenic constituents in cigarette
smoke,theymayhelpexplainhigherlung
cancer deaths among black smokers com-
pared with white smokers.
Future research should focus on clari-
fying the independent and interactive in-
fluences of race and ethnicity, nicotine
intake, nicotine pharmacokinetics, and
nicotine addiction, as well as the relation-
ship between serum cotinine levels and
the risk for smoking-related diseases. At
present, it is not known whether the dif-
ferences in serum cotinine levels have
important implications for smoking pre-
vention strategies and public health.
Nonetheless, the racial or ethnic differ-
ences observed in this research provide a
plausible basis for consideration of differ-
ent patterns of tobacco use and related
health consequences.
