Spontaneous Trait Inferences
on Social Media
Ana Levordashka1 and Sonja Utz1
Abstract
The present research investigates whether spontaneous trait inferences occur under conditions characteristic of social media and
networking sites: nonextreme, ostensibly self-generated content, simultaneous presentation of multiple cues, and self-paced
browsing. We used an established measure of trait inferences (false recognition paradigm) and a direct assessment of impres-
sions. Without being asked to do so, participants spontaneously formed impressions of people whose status updates they saw.
Our results suggest that trait inferences occurred from nonextreme self-generated content, which is commonly found in social
media updates (Experiment 1) and when nine status updates from different people were presented in parallel (Experiment 2).
Although inferences did occur during free browsing, the results suggest that participants did not necessarily associate the traits
with the corresponding status update authors (Experiment 3). Overall, the findings suggest that spontaneous trait inferences
occur on social media. We discuss implications for online communication and research on spontaneous trait inferences.

Social media allow people to communicate at virtually no cost
and effort and build large online networks, which can be pow-
erful sources of social and emotional support (Donath, 2007).
The challenge lies in finding successful ways to maintain and
navigate those networks, since their size and diversity render
traditional maintenance strategies, such as face-to-face com-
munication, less feasible (Resnick, 2001; Tong & Walther,
2011). Snap social processes like spontaneous inferences pres-
ent a potential solution. Research has shown that people spon-
taneously infer traits, goals, and values from minimal exposure
to information (Uleman, Saribay, & Gonzalez, 2008). Social
media offer a near constant stream of information, and if infer-
ences indeed require no more than a passing glance, browsing
might help users gain awareness of their online networks
(Levordashka & Utz, 2016; Thompson, 2008). However, the
extent to which such snap inferences are made online is not
clear. We examine key conditions that could hinder sponta-
neous inferences on social media and report experiments
designed to test whether inferences occur under these
conditions.
In research on online impression formation, it is common to
explicitly ask participants to judge others, whose profiles they
view at their own pace (e.g., Antheunis & Schouten, 2011;
Back et al., 2010; Evans, Gosling, & Carroll, 2008; Gosling,
Augustine, Vazire, Holtzman, & Gaddis, 2011; Pennington &
Hall, 2014; Westerman, Van Der Heide, Klein, & Walther,
2008). In contrast to this deliberate evaluation, browsing
involves skimming through information without any particular
intention. Even if the encountered posts contain relevant cues,
we do not know whether these cues will lead to inferences
when people encounter them briefly and without explicit
impression formation goals.
There is robust evidence that people spontaneously infer
social information and form impressions (Ambady &
Rosenthal, 1992; Uleman et al., 2008), which can persist over
time and affect behavior (Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, &
Hall, 2005; Todorov & Uleman, 2004). Here, we focus on
behavioral descriptions as a cue (Carlston, Skowronski, &
Sparks, 1995; Uleman et al., 2008). Studies have shown that
when reading about others' behavior, people make inferences
even when their task is unrelated to impression formation or
when they are under high cognitive load (Todorov & Uleman,
2003). Status updates often contain trait-implying information
and can therefore be expected to produce similar effects. How-
ever, the evidence for spontaneous trait inferences comes from
laboratory experiments with conditions that differ from social
media in important ways.
Spontaneous trait inference experiments typically use third-
party descriptions (Rim, Uleman, & Trope, 2009; Saribay,

which are particularly powerful in driving impressions. Even
when first-person descriptions are used (e.g., Carlston et al.,
1995), the information is provided to the participants with no
context, and there is little reason to doubt its accuracy. Social
media updates, however, are self-generated and shared volun-
tarily, which makes them less reliable due to strategic self-
presentation (warranting principle; Utz, 2010; Walther, Van
Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, & Tong, 2008).
Moreover, the information in laboratory experiments can be
of rather extreme nature. Behaviors such as ``She threw a chair
at her classmate'' (Bliss-Moreau, Barrett, & Wright, 2008) or
``I kicked [a puppy] out of my way'' (Carlston & Skowronski,
1994; Carlston et al., 1995; McCarthy & Skowronski, 2011) are
used as stimuli, but would rarely be shared online, where infor-
mation tends to be more mild and appropriate (Utz, 2014). This
is problematic because extreme information is known to influ-
ence impressions more strongly (Fiske, 1980; Skowronski &
Carlston, 1989). Indeed, researchers have speculated that too
mild content might not result in spontaneous inferences (Skow-
ronski, Carlston, & Hartnett, 2008).
Another major difference lies in how information is pre-
sented. Nearly, all experiments on spontaneous trait inferences
present only one pair of actor and behavior at a time. Forming a
distinct association under such conditions is more straightfor-
ward than on social media, where different actors and beha-
viors appear in parallel and users browse through without
being particularly attentive. A social media user could easily
be looking at one person, while still processing information
about another, especially while browsing.
Since updates on social media are self-generated and often
mild in content, it is not clear whether they will be sufficiently
powerful as a cue to produce spontaneous inferences. Further-
more, viewing multiple updates in parallel and in ``browse''
mode might hinder the associative process. In a series of
experiments, we tested whether people will spontaneously infer
traits from mild, self-generated social media updates (Experi-
ment 1), when information is presented in parallel (Experiment
2) and merely browsed through (Experiment 3).
General Method
Overview
We adapted an established trait-inference paradigm (false rec-
ognition; Todorov & Uleman, 2002). The paradigm assesses
trait inferences via a recognition task. First, participants see a
number of actors paired with brief trait-implying descriptions.
They are asked to read the descriptions without any mention of
impression formation (learning phase). In a subsequent recog-
nition task, the same actors are paired with single words, and
for each pair, participants indicate whether the word appeared
in the actor's description. It has been shown that if the target
word is the trait implied by the actor's description, participants
make more mistakes saying that it was in the description
(Todorov & Uleman, 2002). This false recognition of implied
traits occurs because, while reading the descriptions, partici-
pants spontaneously infer the implied traits and associate them
with the corresponding authors. When developing the para-
digm, researchers adopted additional control conditions and
counterbalancing to rule out alternative explanations, such as
mere word activation, and effects of extraneous characteristics
of the stimuli. It was consistently demonstrated that the
counterbalancing had no effect, which led the authors and
other researchers employing the paradigm to drop the
counterbalancing.
We followed the same procedure but changed the content
and presentation of stimuli. The stimuli were social media
updates, ostensibly posted by the actor (self-generated) and
nonextreme (appropriate) in content. Experiment 1 followed
the original paradigm but with status updates as stimuli. In
Experiment 2, we used the same content and varied the number
of updates presented simultaneously. In Experiment 3, partici-
pants browsed through all updates at their own pace. Our pri-
mary dependent variable was the number of mistakes (false
recognitions). Whether trait inferences will be made in these
conditions is an open question. What we hypothesize and test
in each experiment is that if trait inferences occur, participants
will make more mistakes for implied traits as compared to other
traits.
Prior research has assessed response times (RTs) to correct
trials. Since longer RTs can be indicative of greater difficulty,
it can be expected that if spontaneous inferences are made, RTs
to implied traits should be longer. Although there has been
some supporting evidence, RTs are not a reliable indicator of
trait inferences. Nevertheless, to be consistent with prior work,
we recorded and reported RTs. In addition to false recognitions,
we developed an alternative assessment of impressions.
We report how we determined sample size, all data exclu-
sions, manipulations, and measures (Simmons, Nelson, &
Simonsohn, 2012). The design and hypotheses were preregis-
tered (osf.io/jqhdz). The experiments were designed in Psy-
choPy (Peirce, 2007) and analyzed in R (R Core Team,
2015). The research was approved by an ethics committee.
We conducted pilot research for Experiments 1 and 2, which
is not reported here, but a report is available online (Levor-
dashka, 2016). The results are consistent with the remaining
experiments and including them in the article would not have
altered our conclusions.
Sample
The effect sizes in spontaneous trait inferences experiments
using the false recognition paradigm are moderately large
(Todorov & Uleman, 2002). A sample of 16 participants would
have been sufficient to achieve statistical power of 0.95 in a two-
tailed dependent-samples t-test. We have decided on larger sam-
ples to ensure power of at least 0.90 for effect sizes of dz
¼ 0.60.
For all experiments, participants were recruited from the
participant pool of a German research institute. Some experi-
ence with social media was called for during recruitment but
not subsequently assessed. Since prior research has not found

gender differences in spontaneous impression formation, we did
not consider it necessary to discriminate participants based on
their gender to ensure a balanced sample. Gender distribution
is reported per experiment. Other demographic information was
collected separately and reported for the sample across experi-
ments. The participants were undergraduate students of various
faculties (no discipline was represented by more than 10%). Age
ranged from 19 to 34 years (M ¼ 24, SD ¼ 3).
Experiment 1
Method
Participants
Thirty participants took part in the study (22 female). After pro-
viding an informed consent, participants received instructions
and completed the study on individual computer screens. The
total duration was 15 min. At the end, participants were
debriefed and reimbursed (2 EUR).
Procedure
Participants saw 36 social media updates (Figure 1), which they
were asked to read carefully (learning phase). On each trial, a
single update was presented for 5 s. In the recognition task, par-
ticipants saw each face from the learning phase, paired with a
word, and had to indicate as quickly as possible whether the
word had appeared in the status update of the person (old word)
or whether it is a new word that was not in the update. For
example, if person A's description was ``Just spilled coffee all
over my laptop!'' and in the test phase person A appeared with
the word laptop, the correct response would be old; any word
that was not in the update (e.g., clumsy) would be a new word.
The presentation order of single trials was randomized in each
task and for each participant.
For the updates, we used 36 sentences (in German), 12 of
which mentioned a personality trait and 24 implied a trait with-
out explicitly mentioning it. The associations between sen-
tences and implied traits were pretested. The number of
positive and negative sentences was balanced.
The sentences were randomly paired with 36 faces from
Bainbridge, Isola, and Oliva (2013). We used equal number
of male and female faces of similar attractiveness and memor-
ability (based on the ratings from the database).
For the recognition task, each face was paired with a word.
Everyone faces whose status update mentioned a trait were
paired with this same trait (presented trait). The remaining 24
sentences were split into three groups: eight faces were paired
with the trait implied by the status update of the same actor
(implied-trait condition); eight faces with the trait that was
implied by a status update of another actor (other-trait condi-
tion); eight faces with a novel trait (control-trait condition).
Presented-trait trials served as fillers and were not analyzed.
The correct response to all other trials was new. Responses old
were coded as errors (false recognitions).
Memory of Stimuli
We assessed participants' memory for the sentences form the
learning phase in a recall task. Participants saw a random selec-
tion of six faces and had to type the corresponding updates. The
responses were coded by research assistants unaware of the
study design. The scale for accuracy was: 0 ¼ no response,
1 ¼ not at all accurate, 2 ¼ accurate meaning; mistakes in word-
ing, 3 ¼ mostly accurate, 4 ¼ accurate. Another item assessed
whether participants recalled a sentence but paired it with the
wrong target. If a participant's response was a somewhat accu-
rate recollection of one of the stimulus sentences but not that of
the target face, the response was coded as mistaken target.
Intercoder reliability was estimated on 20% of the responses,
with ratings from two coders (intraclass correlation coefficient
[ICC] ¼ .93, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.83, 0.97]).
Direct Assessment of Impressions
Participants were asked to evaluate some of the actors (n ¼ 12
per participant) from the learning phase. On each trial, they saw
a face, paired with two traits: The trait implied by the status
update and another trait of the same valence and had to choose
one of the traits to evaluate the person. This assessment of
impressions was an additional measure of trait inferences.
Excluded Cases
Our a priori criterion was 3 SD above or below the sample
mean for each measure in the study. There were no outliers.
One participant made no correct responses in the implied-
trait condition. Since the RT analyses were based on correct
trials, this resulted in missing data. To ensure a balanced
design, we excluded this participant from the RT analysis.
Alternative approaches (replacing the missing data with the
participant's average RTs in the other conditions or with the
average RTs of other participants in the missing condition)
yielded similar results.
Results
We used paired-sample t-tests to test our hypothesis regarding
false recognition rates (Table 1). Participants made more mis-
takes when an actor's face was paired with the trait implied for
this actor (implied-trait condition; M ¼ 0.55, SD ¼ 0.24) as
compared to a trait implied for another actor (other-trait condi-
tion; M ¼ 0.34, SD ¼ 0.22) or a novel trait (control condition;
M ¼ 0.23, SD ¼ 0.17). This pattern suggests that people

spontaneously inferred traits when reading status updates with
mild content, written from a first-person perspective.
Average RTs to correct trials ranged between 1.03 and 3.24
s (M ¼ 2.15, Mdn ¼ 2.22, SD ¼ 0.54). The data violated
assumptions of normality. We performed a log10 transforma-
tion on the row data (RTs per trial). To avoid negative values,
we added 1.0 to all values prior to the transformation. Follow-
ing the transformation, the data no longer violated assumptions
of normality and equal variances (Shapiro Wilk's ps > .06;
Levene's test ps > .1). There were no significant differences
in RTs (all ps > .087).
The recall of the stimulus material was low. For 40% of the
trials, participants were not able to recall anything and 42% of
the recalled sentences were classified as ``not at all accurate.''
As we expected, participants occasionally recalled the status
update of a person other than the one whose picture was dis-
played. This however occurred in only 16% of the cases, which
indicates that overall retention of the stimuli was indeed low.
The occurrence of spontaneous inferences was apparent in the
direct evaluations measure. When asked to evaluate the actors
from the learning task, participants selected the implied trait over
another trait of the same valence 62% of the time. An exact bino-
mial sign test indicated that this was significantly higher than
chance, 95% CI [0.55, 0.69], p ¼ .001. Given the low recall, this
preference is likely due to implicit evaluation based on the
actor's update rather than direct recall of the update.
Discussion
The results of this experiment show that the content typically
encountered on social media can result in spontaneous trait infer-
ences. These inferences were reflected in the outcome of a word
recognition task: Participants were more likely to falsely recog-
nize a word as having been previously mentioned in an actor's
status update, when the word was the trait implied by the update,
as compared to traits implied for other actors and to novel traits.
We also found that when directly asked to evaluate a person,
participants were more likely to choose the trait, implied by this
person's update. Importantly, this likelihood was higher than
what the memory of stimulus materials would suggest. That
is, participants' evaluations were driven by status updates they
had previously seen but could likely no longer recall.
In sum, we provide evidence for trait inferences on the basis
of ostensibly self-generated status updates. However, the pos-
sibility remains that if too much information is presented at
once, there will not be clear associations and person-specific
inferences. The following experiment was designed to address
this concern.
Experiment 2
Method
Nineteen participants took part in the experiment (16 female).
The recruitment, procedure, stimuli, and measures were identi-
cal to that in Experiment 1, with the exception of how we pre-
sented the stimuli. Instead of one at a time, participants saw
nine updates in each of the four trials (60 s per trial). In the test
phase, the implied-trait condition remained unchanged. There
were two comparison conditions: Faces paired with traits
implied by other updates from the same trial and faces paired
with traits from other trials.
There were no outliers based on the three SD criterion. One
participant had to be excluded from the analysis of RTs because
they made no correct responses in the implied-trait condition,
which resulted in missing data.
Results
The number of false recognitions differed significantly across
conditions (Table 2). Participants made considerably more mis-
takes when an actor's face was paired with the trait implied for
this actor (implied-trait condition; M ¼ 0.57, SD ¼ 0.23), as
compared to a trait implied for another actor in the same trial
(M ¼ 0.3, SD ¼ 0.15) or another trial (M ¼ 0.29, SD ¼
0.18). There was no significant difference between the two con-
trol conditions. Crucial here is the difference in false recogni-
tions between traits implied by status updates that were
presented during the same trial. Although the updates appeared
simultaneously, the trait implied by each update was specifi-
cally associated with the person who posted the update.
RTs to correct trials ranged between 1.1 and 5.59 s (M ¼ 2.46,
Mdn ¼ 2.41, SD ¼ 0.99). Due to violated assumptions of normal-
ity,weperformeda log10transformationonRTspertrial(1.0was
added to all values). Following log transformation, the data no
longer violated the assumptions of normality and equal variances
(Shapiro Wilk's ps > .09; Levene's test ps > .79). RTs for correct
responses for implied-trait trials (M ¼ 3.11, SD ¼ 0.92) were
shorter than in the other two conditions (same trial: M ¼ 3.49,
SD ¼ 0.97; other trial: M ¼ 3.46, SD ¼ 1.01; Table 3).
The recall of status updates was low. On the majority of
trials, participants provided no response (47%) or a highly inac-
curate response (28%). There were some cases of recalled
update but a mistaken target (18%), which shows that partici-
pants recalled more than their raw memory scores suggest.
Even when considering these cases, the overall recall was low.
Despite having poor recall of the seen updates, when asked
to evaluate an actor, participants chose the implied trait over
another trait of the same valence 75% of the time, which was
significantly higher than chance, 95% CI [0.66, 0.82], p <
.0001. These results provide evidence that participants made
actor-specific trait inferences.

Discussion
Experiment 2 provided evidence that the simultaneous presen-
tation of status updates can result in distinct, actor-specific
inferences. Participants were more likely to falsely recognize
an implied trait as having been previously presented, which
indicated that they spontaneously inferred the trait. They were
also more likely to associate an actor with the trait implied by
this actor's update, without necessarily being able to recall the
update. We did not find the expected differences in RTs.
Unique to this experiment is the demonstration that when par-
ticipants viewed updates simultaneously, the traits they inferred
from each update were distinctly associated with the author of the
updateandnotwiththeotheractorswhosepictureandupdatethey
viewed at the same time. However, the experimental setup does
not rule out the possibility that browsing poses a boundary condi-
tion to this association. We therefore conducted a third experi-
ment, in which participants browsed through the updates at
their own pace in a setup that closely resembled social media.
Experiment 3
Method
Forty-five participants took part in the study (37 female).
Recruitment was identical to that in previous experiments and
we used a similar procedure. The stimulus material was the
same as in the previous experiments, but instead of presenting
the status updates in discrete trials for fixed amount of time, all
updates appeared on a time line and participants could scroll
through for as long as they like. They were instructed to mark
the updates they found interesting and proceed when ready
(browsing time was recorded). In the test phase, the experimen-
tal conditions were the same as in Experiment 1: implied trait,
other trait, and a novel trait.
Scenario-Based Evaluation Measure
We developed a novel scenario-based measure of direct
impressions. On each of four trials, participants read a situation
and were asked to make a choice between two people. The
situations were such that a person with certain trait would be
preferred (e.g., ``Who would you rather give your house key
to?'' would likely be somebody who is trustworthy rather than
unreliable). For each question, participants had a choice
between two actors: one for which the desired trait was implied
and one for which an opposite trait was implied. We compared
the likelihood of choosing a person with a desired trait over a
person with an undesired trait. To control for the influence of
faces, for every pair of actors in a scenario, we swapped the
traits implied during the learning phase. This manipulation was
done between participants. That is, already in the learning
phase, for half of the participants, person A was paired with the
desired trait and, for the other half, person A was paired with
the undesired trait.
Excluded Cases
There were no outliers in the false recognitions measure and
one RT outlier, who was excluded from the RT analysis. We
excluded one more participant from the RT analysis due to
missing data: They had no correct responses in the implied-
trait condition.
Results
On average, participants spent 2.42 (SD ¼ 1.19) min browsing
the updates, which is an average of 4 s per update. They
marked 20% (SD ¼ 15) of the updates as interesting. Brows-
ing time was positively correlated with memory of the stimu-
lus updates (r ¼ .32, p ¼ .032) but not with error rates
(r ¼ .18, p ¼ .243). The number of interesting updates was
positively correlated with browsing time (r ¼ .51, p < .001).
All zero-order correlations are reported in the supplemental
material.
The pattern of means was consistent with our previous
findings: higher number of error rates in the implied-trait con-
dition (M ¼ 0.43, SD ¼ 0.25) as compared to other-trait (M ¼
0.37, SD ¼ 0.21) and control (M ¼ 0.24, SD ¼ 0.19). The dif-
ference between implied and other-traits was small and only
approaching significance (Table 4). Given that the means are
in line with our hypothesis and a one-sided test (justified by
our preregistered directional prediction) would have been sig-
nificant, we consider that spontaneous inferences did occur.
There was also a significant difference between the other- and
control-trait condition, which we did not find in the previous
experiments. If we are to interpret this pattern according to
Todorov and Uleman (2002), we would conclude that infer-
ences occurred (the least mistakes were made for novel traits)
but were not successfully bound to corresponding faces (no
difference between correctly paired trait-face trials, i.e.,

trait condition).
RTs to correct trials ranged between 0.84 and 3.78 s (M ¼
2.04, Mdn ¼ 1.96, SD ¼ 0.69). Following a log10 transforma-
tion (per trial; 1.0 added to each value), the data no longer vio-
lated the assumptions of normality and equal variances
(Shapiro Wilk's ps > .02; Levene's test ps > .11). Only the dif-
ference between implied and novel traits was significant, t(43)
¼ 2, p ¼ .052 (all other ps > .146).
The recall of status updates was low. Responses were mostly
absent (45%) or highly inaccurate (41%). Occasionally, partici-
pants recalled the sentence of a different actor from the data set
(17%).
The results of our scenario-based assessment offer support
for the occurrence of trait inferences. Across four different sce-
narios, participants selected the actor whose status update
implied a trait that would be desirable in the particular scenario
61% of the times, which was significantly higher than chance,
95% CI [0.54, 0.68], p ¼ .002.
Discussion
Evidence for spontaneous inference during browsing was
found in the direct evaluation measure. In the false recognition
measure, the difference between the implied- and other-trait
conditions was not significant. According to the traditional
interpretation of the paradigm, this pattern suggests that infer-
ences occurred (the least mistakes were made for novel traits)
but were not successfully bound to corresponding faces, as
indicated by the small difference between correctly paired
trait-face trials (implied-trait condition) and mismatched pairs
(other-trait condition). However, it is not clear whether this pat-
tern is robust. The pattern of means corresponds to what was
found in the first two experiments and we found evidence for
inferences in the alternative measure, which renders the possi-
bility that the effect was present but weaker.
General Discussion
The information social media users encounter online is rich in
social cues. Psychological research on first impressions sug-
gests that even without attending to the social aspects of infor-
mation, users might form impressions based on that
information. Despite this possibility and its implications, spon-
taneous inferences have not been studied in the context of
social media. We provide evidence that trait inferences occur
spontaneously from content and under conditions resembling
social media (Figure 2).
Participants spontaneously formed impressions on the basis
of single, nonextreme, ostensibly self-generated status updates
without being instructed to do so. Our research supports the
robustness of spontaneous trait inferences and their relevance
for online communication.
Prior research has shown that person inferences are uninten-
tional, cognitively efficient, long-lasting, and can be of traits
but also values, goals, or intentions (Uleman et al., 2008). This
makes them highly relevant for online communication, where
information is often merely glanced at. Our work is an impor-
tant first step toward examining the impact of spontaneous
impression formation on relational and informational processes
online.
We used an established measure of trait inference. Using a
previously validated measure strengthens the conclusions we
can draw from the research. This particular measure requires
the use of cues that do not explicitly contain the target impres-
sion, which limits the possibility of conducting research with
nonconstructed stimuli (e.g., posts directly taken from social
media). We therefore included alternative assessments, which
involved choosing traits to describe an actor and choosing
between two actors for a scenario that calls for the trait implied
for one of the actors. The outcomes of these alternative mea-
sures were consistent with the false-recognitions measure,
which offers support for their effectiveness.
Framing a spontaneous-inferences paradigm in a social
media setting is another innovation, which can be helpful for
future research. Social media provides a realistic setting for
research on spontaneous inferences, with possibility to manip-
ulate social context and integrate additional tasks in a smooth
way that is intuitive and familiar for the participants.
The experiment in which we investigated impressions dur-
ing browsing provided evidence for actor-specific trait infer-
ences on scenario-based measure of inferences but had
inconclusive results on the recognition measure. Participants
were more likely to falsely recognize previously implied
traits (as compared to novel traits), regardless of whether
they were paired with the person who posted them or another
person from the stimulus set. This pattern suggests that peo-
ple inferred traits from status updates but did not necessarily
associate these traits with their corresponding authors. One
explanation of this would be that while browsing, people paid
more attention to the content itself rather than who posted it.
This would be an interesting result, but we cannot firmly
assess its robustness, which we acknowledge as a limitation
of our present work. The extent to which people form
actor-specific inferences while browsing is an important
future direction. If future research reproduced the pattern
where only novel traits are less likely to be falsely recog-
nized, it would be important to investigate the conditions
under which actor-specific inferences do occur.
One limitation of this and prior research is the handling of
extraneous characteristics of the stimulus material (e.g., faces).
Prior research has included replication conditions with

ognition Rates across Conditions (Experiment 3).

differently paired stimuli and shown that the pairing does not
influence the overall effects, which led the researchers to drop
the replication conditions from future work (Todorov & Ule-
man, 2003). However, the means of assessing that (through
replication conditions which double the sample size) are not
optimal. It would be possible to program studies in a way that
randomizes stimulus pairs at each run thus reducing extraneous
effects to random noise.
Bringing together research on snap social judgment and
online impression formation opens up important directions for
future work. Clearly, there is more to social media than what
our experiments aimed to capture. Under conditions of true
information overload, the ability of cues to attract attention
might matter more than it did in the present research, thus it
will be important to reproduce the effect under even more
cognitively demanding conditions. Another direction for
future studies we have already mentioned is whether and how
spontaneous inferences can help users navigate and maintain
their vast online networks. Examining the accuracy of infer-
ences will be important for understanding such interpersonal
effects.
Conclusion
There are many reasons to browse the streams of updates on
social media sites--to kill time, to catch up on current events,
to have a laugh at a friend's joke. The present research sug-
gests that, without necessarily having the intention to do so,
people form impressions of others. These spontaneous pro-
cesses paint a different picture of what browsing social media
might entail. While scrolling down to catch a colleague's
most recent pun about conference deadlines, a social media
user might also be picking up bits of information that shape
her perceptions of people from various corners of her vast
online networks.
