One in four older adults has type 2 diabetes (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2017). Not only
is the prevalence of diabetes higher among Vietnamese
Americans than Whites (McNeely and Boyko, 2004) but
rates of diabetes-related morbidities and mortality also
are higher for Vietnamese Americans compared to
Whites (e.g. Pugh et al., 1995). To reduce complications
associated with uncontrolled diabetes for which older
adults are at particular risk (Kirkman et al., 2012),
patients must adhere to a number of prescribed health
behaviors, including eating a healthy diet (American
Diabetes Association (ADA), 2017). Adhering to a diet
that promotes blood sugar control is reported to be
among the most difficult aspects of diabetes manage-
ment (Beverly et al., 2008), with correspondingly high
rates of dietary nonadherence (Vijan et al., 2005).
Across races/ethnicities, spouses often serve as an
important influence on their partners'diabetic diet (August
& Sorkin, 2011); Trief et al., 2003). With some exceptions
(e.g. Stephens et al., 2013), most of this literature has
focused on spousal support (e.g. Beverly et al., 2008;
Schokker et al., 2010; Trief et al., 2003). Yet, spouses not
only encourage and provide positive feedback on their
partners' dietary behaviors but also attempt to influence,
or change, diet-related attitudes or behaviors. Furthermore,
most studies on spouses' involvement in their partners'
chronic disease in general have used predominately White
samples. Little is known about potential cultural differ-
ences in how spouses are involved in their partners' dis-
ease management, and even less is known about cultural
differences in specific social processes, such as spousal
influence attempts, in this context. Given that Vietnamese
Americans are at particular risk for poor diabetes out-
comes, efforts to understand these social processes among
one of the fastest-growing Asian subgroup in the United
States (US Census Bureau, 2012) are important for devel-
oping culturally appropriate interventions for patients and
their families. This study accordingly sought to examine
whether factors related to patients' diabetes were impor-
tant for how and how often Vietnamese American versus
White spouses attempted to influence their partners' dia-
betic diet.

Abstract
This study examined whether disease-specific factors were important for how and how often White versus Vietnamese
American spouses influenced their partners' diabetic diet. Results from a cross-sectional survey of 145 older adult
spouses whose partners had type 2 diabetes revealed that Vietnamese American spouses used more frequent spousal
influence (positive and negative) than White spouses. In addition, most of the factors associated with spousal influence
differed for Vietnamese American and White spouses. Findings from this study highlight the importance of proximal and
sociocultural factors in understanding older spouses' influence on their partners' diabetic diet.

Spousal influence on their partners'
diabetic diet
Spouses may attempt to positively influence their partners'
dietary adherence by exerting health-related social control,
which involves efforts to monitor and influence individuals
to improve their health behaviors (e.g. eating a healthy diet;
Lewis and Rook, 1999). Although the intention of social
control may be to facilitate improved health behavior in the
recipient (Hughes and Gove, 1981), whether control is
actually health promoting depends, in part, on the type of
strategy that is used. Two main strategies of social control
have been distinguished in the literature (Lewis and Rook,
1999; Tucker et al., 2006). Positive health-related social
control, or persuasion, refers to gentle reminders, expres-
sions of worry, and other attempts at influence that tend to
elicit positive emotions in the recipient (Stephens et al.,
2009). Negative health-related social control, or pressure,
refers to criticisms, restrictions of behavior, and other
attempts at influence that tend to elicit negative emotions in
the recipient (Stephens et al., 2009). Previous research has
found both types of social control to be common among
older couples managing a diabetic diet (Franks et al., 2012),
although patients with diabetes report receiving (August
and Sorkin, 2010) and nondiabetic spouses report using
(Stephens et al., 2013) persuasion more frequently than
pressure. The behavioral and emotional consequences of
these types of social control are relatively well understood,
with individuals typically responding more favorably to
persuasion than pressure (August and Sorkin, 2010;
Craddock et al., 2015; Stephens et al., 2009, 2013).
Research has begun to examine the potential spousal and
relational consequences associated with engaging in social
control (August et al., 2011, 2013), but little is known about
what factors are associated with the frequency in which
spouses engage in different types of social control.
In addition to spousal efforts to promote dietary adher-
ence by engaging in social control, spouses may detract
from their partners' dietary adherence by engaging in
health-related social undermining, which involves efforts
to hinder individuals'goal of engaging in healthy behaviors
(Gallant et al., 2007; Henry et al., 2013; Rosland et al.,
2010). Compared to the intended health-promoting effects
of social control, undermining may or may not be intended
to be health-compromising (Gallant et al., 2007; Henry
et al., 2013). Furthermore, undermining is less frequently
used than social control in this context (Gallant et al., 2007;
Henry et al., 2013), as spouses and their partners often have
the shared goal of adherence to a chronic disease regimen
(Berg and Upchurch, 2007). Undermining nonetheless may
interfere with patients' efforts to adhere to their prescribed
dietary regimen (Henry et al., 2013; Sorkin et al., 2014).
Although undermining has not been extensively studied in
the context of chronic disease management, Henry et al.
(2013) distinguished between two types of undermining
specific to a diabetic diet. The first type, tempting, refers to
attempts to encourage unhealthy behaviors, such as tempt-
ing a partner to eat foods that are not part of a prescribed
dietary regimen. The second type, disregard, refers to
attempts to discourage healthy behaviors, such as down-
playing the importance of a diabetic diet. Similar to the lit-
erature on strategies of social control, these two types of
negative influence have been shown to be differentially
associated with recipient outcomes, with tempting being
related to dietary nonadherence and disregard being related
to nonadherence to other components of a diabetic regimen
(Henry et al., 2013). Compared to the literature on social
control, even less is known about what factors are associ-
ated with the frequency in which spouses engage in differ-
ent types of undermining.
Factors related to spousal influence
Although some research has focused on factors associated
with providing social support to an individual in need (see
Dunkel-Schetter and Skokan, 1990) including patients with
diabetes (Iida et al., 2010), little is known about factors that
might be associated with spousal influence. Berg and
Upchurch (2007) discuss the importance of contextual fac-
tors in couples' management of chronic disease; specifi-
cally, they note the importance of proximal contextual
factors, including characteristics of the disease itself, as well
as sociocultural factors, including race/ethnicity. Building
on this framework, this study sought to understand how dis-
ease factors are associated with how frequently spouses use
different types of dietary influence and how these associa-
tions may differ as a function of race/ethnicity.
Disease factors.The length of time couples are managing
diabetes may have an impact on what type and how fre-
quent spousal influence attempts are. When couples are
coping with a recent diagnosis, more positive spousal
involvement may be necessary to ensure adherence to a
newly prescribed dietary regimen (Trief et al., 2003). At the
same time, spouses may be more likely to undermine their
partners' efforts to follow their dietary regimen, because
both partners may still be adapting to a newly prescribed
regimen that requires redistribution of household responsi-
bilities and changes to established patterns of behavior that
may challenge continual adherence (Franks et al., 2016;
Lewis et al., 2006).
In addition to an objective factor such as time since
diagnosis, spouses' perceptions of how their partners are
managing or coping with their disease may be important
to consider with regard to how and how often spouses
engage in behaviors to influence their partners' diabetic
diet. Specifically, the extent to which spouses perceive
their partners to already be following a diet consistent
with their prescribed regimen may be related to spousal
influence attempts. Social control has been posited to
August et al. 3
occur when individuals require assistance with self-
regulating their own health behaviors (Hughes and Gove,
1981; Lewis and Rook, 1999). Thus, when patients are
engaging in poor dietary behaviors, spouses would be
more likely to exert social control in an attempt to improve
their dietary behaviors; in contrast, if patients are already
engaging in healthy dietary behaviors, spouses may not
feel a need to engage in such attempts. Whether spouses'
perceptions of their partners' dietary behaviors are related
to spousal undermining is less clear. For example, tempt-
ing may occur in response to patients who already may be
engaging in healthy dietary behaviors, but are offered for-
bidden food in an attempt to provide comfort or other
positive emotions this food may elicit, or to make the
patient feel included in family celebrations that involve
food (Chesla and Chun, 2005; Henry et al., 2013; Wong
et al., 2005). Disregard, in contrast, may occur in response
to spouses' frustration with their partners' lack of effort
in self-regulating their own dietary behaviors (Henry
et al., 2013). Spouses may not want to be burdened or
stressed with the sole responsibility of making sure their
partners are adhering to their diabetic diet (August et al.,
2011, 2013) so they may disregard their partners' diet.
The extent to which spouses perceive their partners to be
worried about their diabetes also may play a role how and
how often spouses influence their partners' behaviors.
Research suggests that many patients and their spouses
worry about diabetic complications and experience anxiety
as a result (Fisher et al., 2002; Polonsky et al., 1995). These
worries may motivate spouses to ensure their partners are
properly adhering to their prescribed regimen by engaging
in more spousal control and less spousal undermining.
Sociocultural contextual factors.Not only is the proximal
context important to consider in understanding spousal
influence but the sociocultural context in which this type of
involvement occurs also warrants consideration (Berg and
Upchurch, 2007; Revenson, 2003). Although a majority of
married patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds
identify their spouses as playing an integral role in their
diabetes management (August and Sorkin, 2011), racial/
ethnic differences in the marital processes (McLoyd et al.,
2000), couples' management of chronic disease (Gallant
et al., 2010), social influence of health behaviors (Gallant
et al., 2007), and dietary beliefs and practices (Tripp-Reimer
et al., 2001) suggest that there also may be racial/ethnic

differences in factors associated with how and how often
spouses attempt to influence their partner's diabetic diet.
Vietnamese Americans are a unique Asian subgroup in
which to examine differences from Whites in the social
influence processes involved in diabetes management. In
addition to experiencing higher rates of diabetes and worse
overall health than Whites (e.g. Sorkin et al., 2008), some
Vietnamese Americans have beliefs about diabetes man-
agement that are inconsistent with Western culture (Ahn
et al., 2003; Nguyen, 2014). Furthermore, norms for spousal
involvement may differ as a function of broad cultural dif-
ferences between individuals from collectivistic and indi-
vidualistic cultures (Cross and Madson, 1997; Triandis,
2001). Little is known, however, about health-related inter-
actions involved in everyday disease management among
Vietnamese Americans--a fast growing, yet understudied,
minority.
This study
Most studies to date have focused on how spouses support
(not influence) their partners' health behaviors in the con-
text of chronic disease management. The evidence that is
available about spousal influence on health behaviors is
focused mainly on implications for patients, and most
research to date has only examined social influence pro-
cesses using predominately White samples. Given the
importance of proximal and sociocultural contextual fac-
tors for spousal involvement in disease management (Berg
and Upchurch, 2007), this study sought to examine the role
of disease (proximal) factors in spousal influence and
whether these factors differed for Vietnamese American
and White older adults (sociocultural).
First, we predicted that Vietnamese American spouses
would engage in more frequent social control than White
spouses. We did not have any specific predictions about
racial/ethnic differences in the frequency of spousal under-
mining, however, given how few studies have examined this
type of influence. Second, we predicted that spouses whose
partners had been diagnosed with diabetes for a shorter
period of time would engage in more frequent spousal con-
trol and undermining. Third, we predicted that spouses who
perceived their partners to be engaging in healthier dietary
behaviors would engage in less frequent spousal control
(both types), more frequent tempting, and less frequent dis-
regard. Fourth, we predicted that spouses who perceived
their partners to have greater diabetes worries would engage
in more frequent social control and less frequent undermin-
ing. We sought to examine whether all of these associations
differed for Vietnamese American and White spouses.
In addition to race/ethnicity, another sociocultural factor
important for understanding couples' management of
chronic disease is gender. Gender differences in overall
spousal involvement in a partner's disease management
(Revenson, 2003), as well as in social influence attempts, in
particular (August and Sorkin, 2010; Rook et al., 2011;
Rosland et al., 2010) have been identified in the literature.
Many of the previous findings related to gender are based
on mostly White samples, however, and thus little is known
whether gender differences in this type of spousal involve-
ment extend to individuals of other races/ethnicities, such
as Vietnamese Americans. Given the small sample size of
men and women from each race/ethnicity in this study, gen-
der is examined as an exploratory moderator.

Method
Participants
Participants included 145 nondiabetic spouses over the age
of 55 years whose partners had a diagnosis of type 2 diabe-
tes. Participants for this study included White (n = 33 male,
53 female) and Vietnamese American (n = 37 male, 22
female) spouses. A majority (86.2%) of Vietnamese
Americans were born outside of the United States, com-
pared to 13.8 percent of Whites.
Procedure
Patients were recruited in 2006 and 2007 from primary care
and endocrinology clinics where they received their primary
diabetes care. Eligibility criteria for patients consisted of
being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and having had at least
one visit with a physician in the 2 years prior to the study.
Married patients who provided written consent were asked to
provide their spouses with a self-report questionnaire to
complete at home and send back in a pre-paid, stamped
envelope. Spouses' compensation for participation included
a US$10 gift card. Approval for the project was provided by
a university-specific Institutional Review Board (See Kaplan
et al. (2013) for additional patient study details).
Measures
All survey questions were provided in English and
Vietnamese. Items were tested for cultural and linguistic
equivalency through focus groups with native speakers, as
well as forward and back translation (Fowler, 1992).
Time since diabetes diagnosis. To assess time since diagnosis
(in years), patients were asked, "How long have you had
diabetes?" This value was subtracted from the year of data
collection.
Spouses' perceptions of their partners' dietary behaviors.To
assess spouses' perceptions of patients' dietary behaviors
important for diabetes management, six items were adapted
from the Kristal Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire
(Shannon et al., 1997). Spouses rated on a 4-point scale
how often in the past week their partners ate low-sugar,
low-fat diets (1 = rarely/none of the time (<1 day), 4 = most
or all of the time (5-7 days)). A sample item included, "Eat
foods high in sugar (such as candy, fruit juice, cookies, tea
or coffee flavored with sugar)." The items were reverse
coded and averaged to create a composite measure of
healthy dietary behaviors ( = .81).
Spouses' perceptions of patients' diabetes worries.To assess
spouses' perceptions of their partners' worries, seven items
were adapted from the Patient Outcome Research Team
study (Greenfield et al., 1994). Spouses rated on a 5-point
scale the extent to which they thought their partners were
worried or concerned about complications that may develop
from diabetes (1 = not at all worried, 5 = extremely wor-
ried). A sample item included "Dying earlier than most
people because of diabetes." The items were averaged to
create a composite measure of diabetes worries ( = .95).
Spousal control (persuasion and pressure).To assess spousal
control of dietary behaviors, items were adapted from Ste-
phens et al. (2009). Spouses rated on a 6-point scale how often
they engaged in control attempts directed toward their partner
in the past month (1 = not at all, 6 = every day). Items were
averaged to create composite measures. Three items assessed
persuasion; a sample item included: "let your spouse know
that his or her poor food choices worry you" ( = .91). Four
items assessed pressure; a sample item included: "express irri-
tation with your spouse's poor food choices" ( = .85).
Spousal undermining (tempting and disregard).To assess
spousal undermining of dietary behaviors, items were
adapted from Henry et al. (2013). Spouses rated on a
6-point scale how often they engaged in undermining
attempts directed toward their partner in the past month (1
= not at all, 6 = every day). One item assessed tempting:
"tempt your spouse to eat foods not on his/her diabetic
diet?" Two items assessed disregard for diabetic diet:
"show that you did not care about how well your spouse
followed his/her diabetic diet?" and "show that you did not
think your spouse's diabetic diet was important." These
items were averaged to create a composite measure of dis-
regard (r = .75, p < .001).
Race/ethnicity.Spouses' race/ethnicity was coded as 0 =
White, 1 = Vietnamese American.
Gender. Spouses'gender was coded as 0 = male, 1 = female.
Covariate selection. The following covariates initially were
chosen a priori based on the literature suggesting that these
factors are important for spousal involvement in disease
management: spouses' age, spouses' education level
(dichotomized at the approximate median split, 0 = high
school or less, 1 = some college or more), marital length,
spouses' perceived marital quality (average of five items
adapted from the Marital Quality Index; Norton, 1983), and
patients'total illness burden (composite measure of chronic
health conditions using a modified version of the Total Ill-
ness Burden Index; Greenfield et al., 2010). Only spouses'
education level was included as a covariate in final analy-
ses because it had a significant (negative) bivariate associa-
tion with spousal persuasion, pressure, and disregard.
Analytic plan. All analyses were conducted using SPSS v24.
No key variables had more than 5 percent data missing
(except time since diagnosis, which had 13.3% missing
data); missing data were excluded from analyses
August et al. 5
using listwise deletion. To examine racial/ethnic and gender
differences in key study variables, we conducted two-way
analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To account for unbalanced
data, we used type 2 sums of squares (Langsrud, 2003); to
account for multiple comparisons, we made a Holm­Bon-
ferroni sequential correction to p-values (Holm, 1979).
To test our study hypotheses, we conducted four multi-
variable linear regression analyses. We included all of the
disease factors in the same regression to determine the
extent to which each disease factor was related to social
influence while controlling for the other factors. We entered
variables in the following stepwise order: main effects of
spouses' education as a covariate, disease factors (time
since diagnosis, spouses' perceptions of patients' dietary
behaviors, and spouses' perceptions of patients' diabetes
worries), race/ethnicity, and gender (Step 1); three two-way
interactions between each disease factor and gender, three
two-way interactions between each disease factor and race/
ethnicity, and the interaction between race/ethnicity and
gender (Step 2); and three three-way interactions between
each disease factor, race/ethnicity, and gender (Step 3). We
probed significant interactions by calculating simple slopes
at -1/+1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean for the inde-
pendent variable and for each race/ethnicity and/or gender.
Results
Participant characteristics
Table 1 presents the results of two-way ANOVAs that
tested racial/ethnic and gender differences in sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and key study variables. Compared
to White spouses, Vietnamese American spouses were
significantly older (F(1, 141) = 11.59, p = .001,

p
2 7 59
= . % ) and less educated (F(1, 138) = 91.82, p <
.001, 
p
2 39 95
= . %), married significantly longer (F(1,
138) = 15.28, p < .001, 
p
2 9 97
= . % ), reported signifi-
cantly lower marital quality (F(1, 137) = 5.50, p = .02,

p
2 3 86
= . % ), and perceived their partners to be eating a
healthy diet significantly more frequently (F(1, 136) =
6.06, p = .015, 
p
2 4 27
= . % ). Vietnamese American
spouses also engaged in significantly more frequent per-
suasion (F(1, 135) = 29.49, p < .001, 
p
2 17 93
= . % ), pres-
sure (F(1, 138) = 8.38, p = .004, 
p
2 5 73
= . % ), and
disregard (F(1, 136) = 20.90, p < .001, 
p
2 13 32
= . % ) than
White spouses. Two significant gender differences also
emerged. Specifically, compared to male spouses, female
spouses were significantly less educated (F(1, 138) =
40.20, p = .01, 
p
2 4 97
= . % ) and engaged in more fre-
quent persuasion (F(1, 135) = 6.86, p = .01, 
p
2 4 84
= . %).
There were no significant racial/ethnic or gender differ-
ences in time since diagnosis, spouses' perceptions of
patient worries, or spousal tempting, nor were there any
significant racial/ethnic by gender interactions in any of
the variables examined.
Finally, results from paired t-tests revealed that persua-
sion was the most frequently used type of spousal influ-
ence, followed by pressure, disregard, and tempting being
the least frequently used type of spousal influence (ts
ranged from 6.64 to 14.42, all ps < .001).
Hypotheses tests
Factors associated with spousal control. In examining predic-
tors of spousal persuasion, there were two significant inter-
actions with race/ethnicity: one between dietary behaviors
and race/ethnicity and one between diabetes worries and
race/ethnicity (Table 2). Specifically, Vietnamese Ameri-
can spouses who perceived their partners to eat a healthy
diet more frequently engaged in more frequent persuasion
than Vietnamese American spouses who perceived their
partners to eat a healthy diet less frequently (b(standard

error (SE)) = 1.03 (0.43), t = 2.34, p = .04); the simple
slopes were not significant for White spouses. In addition,
White spouses who perceived their partners to have more
diabetes worries engaged in more frequent persuasion than
White spouses who perceived their partners to have less
diabetes worries (b(SE = 0.64 (0.18), t = 3.49, p = .01); the
simple slopes were not significant for Vietnamese Ameri-
can spouses.
In examining predictors of spousal pressure, there was
one significant main effect: Spouses' who perceived their
partners to have more diabetes worries engaged in more
frequent pressure ( = .29, p = .002). There was also a sig-
nificant 3-way interaction between time since diabetes
diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and gender ( = -.43, p = .02).
None of the simple slopes for each of the race/ethnicity and
gender pairs were significant, however.
Factors associated with spousal undermining. In examining
predictors of spousal tempting, there was one significant
effect: a three-way interaction between diabetes worries,
race/ethnicity, and gender (Table 3). Only the simple
slope for Vietnamese American female spouses was sig-
nificant (b(SE) = 0.73 (0.25), t = 2.92, p = .01), although
the simple slope for Vietnamese American male spouses
was marginally significant (b(SE) = -0.40 (0.20), t =
2.02, p = .07). Specifically, Vietnamese American female
spouses who perceived their partners to have more dia-
betes worries engaged in more tempting than Vietnamese
American female spouses who perceived their partners
to have less diabetes worries; in contrast, Vietnamese
American male spouses who perceived their partners to
have more diabetes worries engaged in (marginally) less
tempting than Vietnamese American male spouses who
perceived their partners to have less diabetes worries.
In examining predictors of spousal disregard, there was
one significant main effect: spouses who perceived their
partners to have more diabetes worries engaged in more
frequent disregard ( = .18, p = .04). One significant three-
way interaction also emerged between time since diabetes
diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and gender. Only the simple slope
for Vietnamese American male spouses was significant
(b(SE) = 0.13 (0.04), t = 3.24, p = .007), although the sim-
ple slope for White female spouses was marginally signifi-
cant (b(SE) = 0.03 (0.01), t = 2.10, p = .06). Specifically,

Older Vietnamese American and White spouses are fre-
quently involved in their partners' diabetic diet, yet more
needs to be understood about factors related to whether
they promote or detract from their partners' dietary

adherence in other ways besides providing support. Given
the importance of both proximal and sociocultural contex-
tual factors in couples' coping of a chronic disease such as
diabetes (Berg and Upchurch, 2007), this study examined
whether disease factors associated with how frequently
spouses engaged in different types of influence on their
partners' diabetic diet differed for older Vietnamese
American and White men and women.
Spousal influence on their partners' diabetic diet
Among all spouses, spousal control was used more fre-
quently than spousal undermining, suggesting that spouses
in general do not want to engage in behaviors that challenge
their shared goal with their partners of adhering to a pre-
scribed dietary regimen (Berg and Upchurch, 2007). There
were racial/ethnic differences in how frequently spouses
engaged in most types of spousal influence and a gender dif-
ference in how frequency spouses engaged in persuasion.
Spousal control.The finding that Vietnamese American
spouses engaged in more frequent persuasion than White
spouses may reflect expectations among individuals from
interdependent cultures that spouses are more likely to be
more involved in their partners' disease management than
individuals from independent cultures (Berg and Upchurch,
2007). The behaviors used to persuade partners to change
their dietary behaviors, such as spouses trying
to do something to improve their partners' diet, are more
consistent with dyadic forms of coping that are more com-
mon in Asian than Western cultures (Lyons et al., 1998).
Like Vietnamese Americans, women have interde-
pendent self-representations (Cross and Madson, 1997),
and also like Vietnamese Americans, they engaged in
more frequent persuasion than male spouses. This finding
is consistent with previous studies that focus on recipient
reports of social control (e.g. August and Sorkin, 2010).
Two possible reasons may account for why this gender
difference is seen in persuasion (but not pressure). First,
the older women in this study are more likely to adhere to
traditional gender roles by being responsible for planning
and preparing meals (Trief et al., 2003); this role may
allow women to more easily persuade their husbands to
eat a healthy diet. Second, female spouses may be better
able than male spouses to calibrate their strategies to use
ones that are more commonly associated with positive
emotional responses in their partners (e.g. persuasion;
Stephens et al., 2013), as women tend to be more aware of
their spouses' emotional experiences than men (Kiecolt-
Glaser and Newton, 2001).
Spousal undermining. The finding that Vietnamese Ameri-
can spouses engaged in more frequent disregard than
White spouses could reflect the idea that the diabetic diet
is incompatible with some of the common dietary habits
of Vietnamese Americans that include high-glucose

starches (e.g. white rice; Nguyen, 2014). Vietnamese
American spouses who do not have diabetes themselves
may prefer to prepare and eat some of these commonly
consumed foods (Nguyen, 2014) for themselves and oth-
ers family members likely in the household (McLoyd
et al., 2000). These efforts may be reflected in the extent
to which they report showing their partners that they care
about or think their diabetic diet is important.
Factors related to spousal influence
In addition to racial/ethnic and gender differences in the
frequency of spousal influence, the sociocultural context
played a role in which disease factors were related to differ-
ent types of spousal influence.
Spousal control.The factors related to persuasion differed
for Vietnamese American and White spouses. For Vietnam-
ese American spouses, perceiving their partners to be eat-
ing a healthy diet more frequently was related to more
frequent persuasion. This finding is contrary to expecta-
tions and inconsistent with the idea that social control is
exerted in response to individuals' unsuccessful efforts at
self-regulation (Hughes and Gove, 1981; Lewis and Rook,
1999). This finding could be the result of the cross-sectional
nature of the study design, however, and reflect the oppo-
site direction of hypothesized effects, in which recipient
reports of persuasion are associated with eating a healthy
diet more frequently (August and Sorkin, 2010). Specifi-
cally, it is possible that Vietnamese American spouses' pre-
vious efforts at persuasion may have been effective (August
and Sorkin, 2011), resulting in spouses perceiving their
partners to be engaging in healthy dietary behaviors.
For White spouses, perceiving their partners to have
more diabetes worries was associated with more frequent
persuasion. These spouses may attempt to allay their part-
ners' worries by engaging in efforts to persuade their part-
ners into eating a healthier diet. Similar to findings for
White spouses, more diabetes worries were related to
more frequent spousal pressure among all spouses. One
possible reason spouses' worries were not predictive of
Vietnamese American spouses' efforts to use persuasion
may reflect the difference in emotional expressiveness
among Vietnamese Americans compared to Whites (Kim
et al., 2008), making it less likely that Vietnamese
American patients' worries are expressed in interactions
with their spouses. When patients' worries are visible,
then they may be viewed by spouses as particularly seri-
ous and prompt spouses to use more heavy-handed influ-
ence attempts (i.e. pressure) to improve their partners'diet
and lessen their partners' worries.
Finally, contrary to expectations, time since diagnosis was
not related to frequency of spousal control, suggesting that
spouses may engage in social control at the relatively same
frequency regardless of when their partners were diagnosed.
Spousal undermining. Contrary to expectations, Vietnamese
American male and White female spouses whose partners
had been diagnosed with diabetes for a shorter period of
time engaged in less frequent disregard. These spouses may
be particularly vigilant in their efforts to avoid engaging in
behaviors that show disregard for their partners' diet at a
time when symptoms may not be well-controlled and the
importance of the diet is communicated by more than one
health care provider patients are likely to see early in their
disease course. It is unclear why this objective disease fac-
tor was not related to the frequency of Vietnamese Ameri-
can female and White male spouses' disregard, however,
and would need to be replicated in a larger sample to
increase confidence in its validity.
Spouses' perceptions of their partners' worries were
important for undermining, although most of the findings
were not in the direction that was expected. One unex-
pected finding was that all spouses who perceived their
partners to have more diabetes worries engaged in more
frequent disregard. Perhaps, in attempting to assuage their
partners' concerns about diabetes complications, spouses
may downplay the importance of dietary behaviors in suc-
cessful diabetes management. Instead, spouses may stress
the importance of other more "medical" self-care behaviors
(e.g. taking medication/insulin) that patients find easier to
engage in (Beverly et al., 2008) and are more adherent to
(Glasgow et al., 1987).
Spouses' perceptions of their partners' worries also
were important for spousal tempting, but only among
Vietnamese American spouses. Specifically, Vietnamese
American female spouses who perceived their partners to
have more diabetes worries engaged in more tempting; in
contrast, Vietnamese American male spouses who per-
ceived their partners to have more diabetes worries
engaged in less tempting. This finding may be partially
explained by gender differences in the relative use of cop-
ing strategies (Tamres et al., 2002). Vietnamese American
female spouses may be more likely to use an emotion-
focused coping strategy of preparing and offering forbid-
den food in response to perceiving their husband's worries.
Vietnamese American male spouses, however, may be
more likely to use a problem-focused coping strategy of
not tempting their partners to eat foods that they believe
may lead to more health issues (Nguyen, 2014). It is
unclear why this same effect is not seen among White
spouses, although these findings for tempting should be
interpreted with caution, as only a very small proportion of
variance (3%) is explained by all variables in the model,
and tempting was the least frequently reported influence
attempt in this study.
Finally, contrary to expectations, spouses' perceptions
of their partners' dietary behaviors were not related to
spousal undermining (tempting or disregard), suggesting
that spouses may engage in undermining regardless of how
well patients are adhering to their diet.
August et al. 9
Taken together, the findings from this study suggest that
health-promoting and health-compromising influence on
dietary behaviors occur at different frequencies and for
potentially different reasons among spouses from different
races/ethnicities (and in some cases, genders). Spouses'
perceptions of their partners' worries seem particularly
important for spousal influence attempts.
Limitations and future directions
In evaluating the findings from this study, some limitations
should be noted. First, because the results from this study
are cross-sectional, we are unable to determine the tempo-
ral order of effects or predict change over time. Although
we posited that subjective disease factors, such as percep-
tions of dietary adherence and diabetes worries, may
prompt spouses to engage in influence attempts, there is
likely to be a bidirectional association between spousal
influence and these factors (e.g. Franks et al., 2012;
Stephens et al., 2013). Future studies should examine these
patterns longitudinally, as well as use experience sampling
methodologies in an attempt to determine the directionality
of findings. An additional limitation is the small number of
items used to assess spousal undermining, and the low fre-
quency of undermining (both types) spouses reported. It is
possible, however, that there are less varied (and less fre-
quent) spousal efforts to undermine a partner's diet than
there are to control it. Another limitation is the small sam-
ple size, with few Vietnamese American female spouses, in
particular. Although the findings from this study provide
preliminary evidence about social influence among male
and female spouses from two different cultures, they would
need to be replicated with a larger sample size to enhance
their validity. In a related vein, a more in-depth understand-
ing of spousal influence in this context among individuals
from racial/ethnic minority groups who are at a high risk
for diabetes (CDC, 2017) is an important next step for
research. Finally, these findings cannot be generalized to
individuals with type 1 diabetes, who likely have been
diagnosed for a longer period of time and require the use of
insulin as part of their self-management regimen (ADA,
2017); thus, an examination of the reasons for how and how
much spouses are involved in type 1 diabetes management
is another important direction for future research.
Despite these limitations, the results from this study add
to the literature on health-related spousal influence in the
context of disease management and underscore the impor-
tance of examining cultural differences in these social pro-
cesses. Given the benefit of including spouses in chronic
disease management interventions (Martire, 2005), in
which an important aspect of treatment success is behavior
change in the spouse (Burmin and Margolin, 1992), identi-
fying factors related to spouses'behavior is essential for the
effective design of interventions. These interventions
should better educate spouses to engage in behaviors that
facilitate, rather than detract from, their partners' diabetic
diet and should include elements consistent with cultural
and gender-specific relationship dynamics, as well as dis-
ease management beliefs and behaviors. The consideration
of the broader sociocultural context is particularly impor-
tant given the growing population of diverse older adults
who are at a high risk for developing diabetes (CDC, 2017).
