ABSTRACT
The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling system
essential for modulating neurogenesis and promoting astro-
genesis. Similarly, the cAMP signaling cascade can promote
astrocytic commitment in several cell culture models, such
as the C6 glioma cell line. These cells have the capacity
to differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, char-
acteristics that allow their use as a glial progenitor model.
In this context, we explore here the plausible involvement
of cAMP in Notch-dependent signal transactions. The ex-
posure of C6 cells to a non-hydrolysable cAMP analogue
resulted in a sustained augmentation of Notch activity, as
detected by nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain
portion (NICD) and transcriptional activity. The cAMP ef-
fect is mediated through the activation of the -secretase
complex, responsible for Notch cleavage and is sensitive to
inhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. As
expected, Notch cleavage and nuclear translocation resulted
in the up-regulation of the mRNA levels of one of its target
genes, the transcription factor Hair and enhancer of split
5. Moreover, the glutamate uptake activity, as well as the
expression of astrocytic markers such as glial fibrillary acidic
protein, S100 protein and GLAST was also enhanced in
cAMP-exposed cells. Our results clearly suggest that during
the process of C6 astrocytic differentiation, cAMP activates
the PKA/-secretase/NICD/RBPJ pathway and Notch1 ex-
pression, leading to transcriptional activation of the genes
responsible for glial progenitor cell fate decision.

INTRODUCTION
Astrocytes are generated during CNS (central nervous sys-
tem) embryonic development from neuronal stem cells
and glial progenitors (reviewed in Kriegstein and Alvarez-
Buylla, 2009). Astrocyte differentiation is regulated by dif-
ferent extracellular stimuli. Among these, the BMP (bone
morphogenic protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6) and neuropep-
tide PAC1 [PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide) ligand/type 1 receptor] systems have been char-
acterized (Adachi et al., 2005; Nakamachi et al., 2011).
During development, alterations in the ratio of neurons
to glia may severely perturb neuronal function. The sem-
inal observation that neurons are generated prior to glia,
suggests that newly generated neurons signal to NPCs (neu-
ronal progenitor cells) to regulate their cellular fate (Tem-
ple, 2001). The molecular basis of this signaling has not
been completely described, although an interplay between
the extracellular cues and intracellular mechanisms in which
cell­cell interactions occurs is expected. In fact, embryonic
NPCs generate neurons only when they are cultured on
top of embryonic cortical slices, in contrast with an en-
hanced gliogenesis if cells are plated upon adult cortical

slices, clearly suggesting that secreted NPC factors regu-
late the switch from neurogenesis to astrocyte production
(Morrow et al., 2001). More recently, the involvement of
members of the IL-6 cytokine family has been described
as promoters of astrocytic differentiation. Specifically, CT-
1 (cardiotropin-1) induces glia commitment in mouse NPCs
via the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and ac-
tivator of transcription) pathway (Barnabe-Heider et al.,
2005).
Notch1 is a member of a conserved family of transmem-
brane receptors that participate in cell fate decision during
development. Notch family members, are activated by the
Delta-like and Jagged ligands. Upon ligand binding, Notch1
undergoes a concerted action of the proteolytic enzymes
ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)/TACE [TNF (tumor
necrosis factor)-converting enzyme]/-secretase that ulti-
mately release the NICD (Notch1 intracellular domain). The
NICD is translocated into the nucleus transforming the CBF1
[RBPJ (recombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin
 region)]/Su(H)/LAG1(CSL) repressor complex into an acti-
vator that induces the transcription of a variety of genes.
These include the family of transcription factors Hes and
Hey, known to play a critical role in pro-neural gene re-
pression (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). In this context, a role
for Notch signaling in the NPC-mediated switch to glio-
genesis has been suggested (Namihira et al., 2009). NICD
up-regulates NFI (nuclear factor I), a member of the CCAAT
box element-binding family of transcription factors. Sev-
eral lines of evidence indicate that active Notch signaling
blocks neurogenesis while promoting astrogenesis. Whether
Notch is a permissive or an instructive pathway is not clear
at this moment (Stockhausen et al., 2010). The cAMP signal-
ing cascade has long been known to be critically involved in
transcriptional regulation. The CREB (cAMP-responsive ele-
ment binding protein) is one of the most studied transcription
factors that participate in CNS differentiation (Merz et al.,
2011). PACAP, as noted above, is a known glial promoting
agent that exerts its activity through G-protein-coupled re-
ceptors, leading to an increase in cAMP levels and resulting
in an augmentation of the expression of astrocytic genes,
such as the intermediate filament GFAP (glial fibrillary acid
protein) (Tatsuno et al., 1996). Nestin, another intermedi-
ate filament, is transiently expressed in neuroepithelial stem
cells of the developing CNS and has been regarded as a useful
marker for glial developing cells due to its down-regulation
correlating with differentiation into astrocytes, oligodendro-
cytes or neurons (Lendahl et al., 1990; Hendrickson et al.,
2011).
The glioblastoma-derived C6 cell line is morphologically
similar to glial precursors and expresses low GFAP levels (re-
viewed in Grobben et al., 2002). The treatment of these cells
with dbcAMP (dibutyryl-cAMP) results in a change in their
morphology and the subsequent expression of the astrocytic
markers S100 and GFAP, and an increase in [3H]D-aspartate
uptake activity (Segovia et al., 1994; Yoshimura et al., 1996;
Takanaga et al., 2004).
All these observations prompted us to analyze the plau-
sible cAMP/Notch1 interplay during astrocytic differentia-
tion. To this end, C6 cells were differentiated by dbcAMP
treatment, and the expression of GFAP, S100 and the Na+ -
dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) was in-
vestigated. We were able to establish that cAMP effects
are mediated through PKA (protein kinase A) and that the
NICD/RBPJ pathway regulates GFAP, S100, Notch1 and
GLAST expression, supporting the idea that Notch1 acts as a
permissive pathway in gliogenesis.

the HSV-TK (Herpes virus thymidine kinase) promoter and
five CRE (cAMP-response element) elements (Rutberg et al.,
1999).
Cell culture and treatments
C6 cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium, Sigma­Aldrich) containing 5% FBS (PAA Laborato-
ries), 120 units/ml penicillin (Penprocilin 800000 units, Lake-
side), 150 g/ml streptomycin (Sulfestrep, Pisa Laboratories)
and 40 g/ml gentamicin (Schering Plough), at 37C un-
der 5% CO2
. When cells were at 80% confluence, treatments
were applied in DMEM/0.5% FBS. Unless otherwise indicated,
dbcAMP was applied to a final concentration of 750 M and
replaced every 48 h. In all cases when DAPT and H89 were
added before treatment, vehicle (DMSO) was also tested. The
highest DMSO concentration in media was 0.16% with no
effect in control experiments (values were always similar to
the untreated control).
Transfection and reporter gene assays
Cells were seeded into 24-well plates (6.5 × 104 cells/well)
and transfected with 0.5g of 4xwtCBF1Luc/4xmtCBF1Luc
or 0.5g of pGF1L constructs using LipofectamineTM 2000
(GE Healthcare) in accordance with manufacturer's instruc-
tions. After 24 h, transfection media was removed and re-
placed with fresh culture medium. Cells were treated with
dbcAMP or forskolin for 24 h. Inhibitors (H89 and DAPT)
were added 30 min before treatment. Luciferase activity was
determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega);
and activity values were normalized to protein content
and expressed relative to those recorded in non-treated
controls.
For pCRE-CAT, 1.3 × 105 cells/well were cultured on to
12-well plates and transfected with 2.1 g of the vec-
tor using LipofectamineTM 2000 as described above. Af-
ter 24 h, transfection media was removed and replaced
with fresh culture medium; and the culture treated with
dbcAMP and forskolin. Protein lysates were obtained us-
ing 5 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Equal amounts of
protein lysates (80 g) were incubated with 0.25 Ci
of [14C]chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol, Amersham Bio-
sciences) and 0.8 mM acetyl-CoA (Sigma­Aldrich) at 37C.
Acetylated forms were separated by TLC and quantified us-
ing a Typhoon Optical Scanner (Molecular Dynamics). CAT
activities were expressed as relative activities to non-treated
control cell lysates.
For co-transfection experiments 1.25 × 106 cells, 1.25 g
of p4xwtCBF1Luc/p4xmtCBF1Luc and 3.75 g of pEF-BOS
or pFCDN1 were used to perform the electroporation assay
(200 mV, BTX Electroporator, Harvard Apparatus) (Neumann
et al., 1982). After electroporation, cells were cultured for
48 h in DMEM/5% FBS. Luciferase activity was determined
as described above.
RT­qPCR (reverse transcription­quantitative
PCR)
For RT-qPCR, C6 cells (6.5­7.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded
into six-well plates. Cells were treated with dbcAMP (750 M)
and, when indicated, co-treated with DAPT (40 M) or H89
(10 M). Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
Trizol® method (GE Healthcare). One microgram of total
RNA was used in each assay. RT reactions were performed
using the reverse transcriptase Improm-II (Promega), 0.1 g
of oligo(dT)23
as the primer (Fermentas) and 10 mM dNTPs
[dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP (GE Healthcare)] in a final vol-
ume of 20 l with nuclease-free water (Promega). The re-
verse transcription step was performed at 25C for 5 min,
37C for 60 min and 70C for 15 min. Quantitative real-
time PCR was performed with SYBR green Ready Taq PCR
Reaction Mix (Fermentas) for GFAP, S100, GLAST, PEN-
2, Hes5, Notch1 and GAPDH. In all cases, the conditions
were: after an initial cycle of 10 min at 94C, 40 cycles of
amplification (30 s at 94C; 1 min at 60C; 30 s at 72C)
and a melt curve (15 s at 95C; 1 min at 60C; 15 s at
95C). Triplicate samples were subjected to qPCR using the
Step One plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
PCR amplifications were analyzed with Step one plus soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems). The relative abundance of each
mRNA is expressed as sample versus a control in comparison
with GAPDH mRNA and was calculated using the 2- Ct
method. Primers used for amplification were as follows: GFAP

Staining procedures
Cell culture staining with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-
bodies was performed. C6 cells were grown in eight-well
Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International) with the
same culture conditions and treatments as described above.
Cells were fixed by exposure to acetone at - 20C for 3 min;
and washed twice with 1 × PBS. Cells were permeabilized
with 1 × PBS/0.25% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
were blocked 30 min with IgG-free albumin (US Biologi-
cal). Immediately, C6 cells were incubated with anti-GFAP
(goat polyclonal, 1:50), anti-Notch1 (goat polyclonal, 1:50),
anti-cleaved Notch1 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:50), anti-RNA pol
II (mouse monoclonal, 1:100) or anti-Nestin (mouse mon-
oclonal, 1:1000) antibodies for approximately 16 h at 4C.

C. Angulo-Rojo and others
The binding of the primary antibodies was visualized us-
ing fluorescein labeled anti-goat antibody (1:100, Invitro-
gen); Alexa Fluor 488 labeled anti-rabbit (1:200, Invitrogen);
and Alexa Fluor 594 labeled anti-mouse (1:1000 or 1:400,
Sigma­Aldrich and Invitrogen respectively). Control of im-
munolabeling was performed with the same staining pro-
cedure, using the visualizing reagents without the primary
antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained using DAPI (dilution
1:1200; stock 2 mg/ml). The slides were mounted with Immu-
mount (Thermo Scientific) and fluorescence was examined
using a Leica confocal microscope. Coverslips were observed
in a Leica TCS-SPE confocal microscope using an oil 63 ×
objective (zoom 1; 1024 × 1024 pixel format). Images were
obtained from exciting fluorochromes (wavelengths: 488 nm
for FITC and Alexa Fluor 488; 594 nm for Alexa Fluor 594;
and 358 nm for DAPI) for a single labeling. Co-localization
ratio was determined using Leica LAS AF version 2.2.0, build
4758 software in 3D projections (stacked images) with a
30% background pixel and 50% threshold, equal for both
channels. The co-localization ratio, as defined in Leica soft-
ware (http://www.leica-microsystems.com) was determined
selecting the area corresponding to the nuclei of each cell
and using (as instructed by Leica) the formula:
Co - localization Ratio = Co - localization Area/Area
Foreground
Area Foreground = Area Image - Area Background
Protein extracts and subcellular fractionation
Whole-cell extracts from cultured C6 cells were prepared by
scraping the cells in PBS buffer with protease and phos-
phatase inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 mM Na2
MoO4
, 25 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3
VO4
). After centrifugation at 10015 g for
5 min, the cell pellet was lysed using the RIPA Lysis Buffer
System (prepared in accordance with manufacturer's instruc-
tions, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and vortex-mixed for 1 h at
4C. Cell debris was discarded by centrifugation for 5 min
at 15198 g.
To isolate cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts, 5 × 106
cells were pelleted and resuspended in 300 l of TM-2
buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2
, 0.5 mM PMSF,
1 × CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)
and 2mM Na2
VO4
] and incubated for 10 min on ice; 300 l
of 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 was then added and the homogenate
incubated on ice for 10 min. Cellular membrane debris was
removed by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei
were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 2432 g
for 15 min at 4C. The supernatant was saved as the cytoso-
lic fraction and the pellet resuspended in 100 l of sucrose
buffer I [0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 3 mM CaCl2
,
2 mM Mg(CH3
COO)2
, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF
and 0.5% Nondet P40] and 100 l of sucrose buffer II [2 M
sucrose, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 5 mM Mg(CH3
COO)2
, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF]. The nuclei suspension
was transferred into a new tube with 200 l of sucrose buffer
II; after nuclei suspension, 1 ml of sucrose buffer I was added
and then centrifuges at 16438 g for 180 min at 4C (sucrose
gradient formation). The nuclear pellet was suspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
1 mM PMSF, 1 × CompleteTM protease inhibitor and 2 mM
Na2
VO4
), sonicated and centrifuged at 16438 g for 2 min at
4C, with supernatant retained as nuclear protein fraction.
SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis
For all extracts, a small aliquot was used for protein con-
centration determination by the Bradford method (Bradford,
1976). Equal amounts of protein (quantities are indicated in
the Figure legends) were diluted in Laemmli's sample buffer,
boiled for 10 min and analyzed through 6 or 10% polyacry-
lamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE). Proteins were trans-
ferred on to PVDF membranes and stained with Ponceau
S solution to confirm equal loading of proteins. The blots
were soaked in 1 × TBS to remove Ponceau staining and in-
cubated with the primary antibodies [anti-cleaved Notch1
(1:100), anti-Notch1 (1:1500), anti Hes5 (1:2000), anti-PEN2
(1:200), anti-actin (1:50) and anti-GAPDH (1:1000)] diluted
in 0.25% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in 1 × TBS buffer, followed
by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Finally, the protein bands were developed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham ECL PlusTM Western Blot-
ting Detection Reagent) and exposed to X-ray films.
Uptake assays
The uptake of [3H]D-aspartate used as a non-metabolizable
analogue of glutamate, was performed as detailed elsewhere
(Ruiz and Ortega, 1995). Briefly, the culture medium was ex-
changed with solution A (25 mM Hepes-Tris, 130 mM NaCl,
5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2
, 0.8 mM MgCl, 20 mM glucose
and 1 mM NaHPO4
, pH 7.4) and the cells were pre-incubated
for 30 min at 37C. Monolayers were incubated with solu-
tion A containing [3H]D-aspartate (0.4 Ci/ml) for 20 min.
Thereafter, the medium was removed by rapid aspiration;
the monolayers were washed with ice-cold solution A three
times and solubilized with 0.1 M NaOH. Aliquots of the sus-
pension were used for protein determination by the Bradford
method (Bradford, 1976) and liquid scintillation counting.
All of the uptake experiments were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism software (see statistical analysis).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the means+
-S.E.M. A one-way ANOVA
was performed to determine whether there were significant
differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated
significance (at the 0.05 level), post-hoc Student­Newman­
Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions
were significantly different from each other (Prism, GraphPad
Software).

PKA-mediated Notch activation
RESULTS
dbcAMP-PKA activation precedes NICD nuclear
translocation in C6 cells
To analyze Notch pathway activity along the astrocytic dif-
ferentiation induced by dbcAMP in C6 cells, NICD nuclear
translocation was evaluated using several strategies. First,
by immunostaining with an antibody directed against the
C-terminal end of Notch1 that was used to locate the nu-
clear and cytoplasmic protein and to image its co-localization
with a nuclear marker, RNA pol II. As depicted in Figure 1(A),
after 24 h of dbcAMP exposure (750 M), nuclear staining
for Notch was increased (merged images). To test whether
PKA activation leads to NICD nuclear translocation, we took
advantage of the PKA inhibitor H89, noticing a clear block-
age in nuclear translocation and also in the global Notch1
expression (Figure 1A).
Nuclear Notch signal was also quantified after treatment
by recording co-localization ratios (see the Materials and
methods section) for anti-Notch1-stained cells when nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI. We did notice a 2-fold in-
crease in the nuclear signal (histogram in 1B). In line with
the results obtained in Figure 1(A), H89 blocks NICD nuclear
translocation, meaning that the dbcAMP effect was com-
pletely abrogated. As expected, -secretase inhibition using
DAPT also decreased NICD nuclear translocation by 50% in
comparison with dbcAMP-treated cells (Figure 1B).
As a second approach, cleaved NICD was located (im-
munostained) using a specific antibody that recognizes
Val1744, only detectable when NICD has been released by
the action of -secretase. The cleaved form of Notch1 is
located in the nuclei of C6 cells after 24 h of dbcAMP ex-
posure (750 M). Note that the same pathway (PKA and -
secretase), is responsible for this localization (Figure 2A). The
nuclear NICD observed in Figure 2(A), clearly comes from the
specific cut induced after treatment, as Western blot analysis
using nuclear extracts from dbcAMP-treated cells demon-
strate an enhanced signal that matches with the decrease in
the NICD cytoplasm detection (Figure 2B). Again, blockage
of the PKA pathway avoids the appearance of nuclear NICD.
Interestingly, a total disappearance from the nuclei is again
clearly evident when both inhibitors are used, suggesting a
cross-talk between PKA activation and the NICD cleavage
that leads to NICD nuclear translocation. In this scenario,
DAPT blocks all signal (Figure 2C).
Cross-talk between PKA activation and
NICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription
NICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription in dbcAMP-treated
cells was determined using a reporter system directed by four
RBPJ-responsive elements (p4xwtCBF1Luc). As a positive
control, C6 cells were co-transfected using the RBPJ reporter

C6 cells were treated with dbcAMP (750 M); where indicated, the PKA in-
hibitor H89 (10 M) or the -secretase inhibitor DAPT (40 M) were added

expected, the 4xwtCBF1Luc vector activity, dependent on
RBPJ activation by NICD, showed a 6-fold increase in lu-
ciferase activity (Figure 3A). A progressive and significant
(P < 0.001) increase in NICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription
was observed in dbcAMP-treated cells; the maximal value was
observed with 1 mM dbcAMP (Figure 3A). A mutated-reporter
version (4xmtCBF1Luc vector, containing RBPJ mutated el-
ements) was used as an additional control. No increase in
luciferase levels could be detected when C6 cells were trans-
fected and treated or co-transfected with pEF1a-BOS-NICD

plus H89 (Figure 3B). Forskolin, an established adenylate cy-
clase activator, augmented the NICD/RBPJ-dependent tran-
scription, but to a lesser extent (300­400%) than that ob-
served with dbcAMP. Co-treatment with forskolin and H89
was used as a positive control. The increase in NICD/RBPJk-
dependent transcription observed with dbcAMP was signif-
icantly decreased (40%) when -secretase was inhibited
(P < 0.05) (Figure 3B). Additionally, PKA/CREB activation
was evaluated with a CAT reporter plasmid directed by five
CREB-responsive elements in dbcAMP-treated cells. The re-
sults shown in Figure 3(C) depict a 6-fold increase in CREB-
dependent transcription (P < 0.001).
A consequence of CREB activation is PEN-2 up-regulation,
as was previously demonstrated (Wang et al., 2006). PEN-2
expression was determined measuring mRNA and protein lev-
els under dbcAMP treatment. Under these conditions, PEN-
2 protein and mRNA levels were increased, reaching max-
imum by the second day after treatment (Figures 3D and
3E). The latter effect on mRNA levels was blocked when the
PKA inhibitor was added (Figure 3D). These results clearly
demonstrate that during astrocytic C6 cell differentiation,
a cAMP/PKA/Notch1 signaling cascade is taking place, and
open the possibility that up-regulation of PEN-2, a key com-
ponent of the -secretase complex, could be the connection
between both pathways.
The Notch1 target Hes5 is regulated by
PKA/NICD/RBPJ activation
We next decided to evaluate Hes5 expression at mRNA and
protein levels. A significant increase both in protein and
mRNA levels was detected after the first day of dbcAMP treat-
ment, reaching their maximal value (25-fold) and (7-fold) by
the second day and progressively decreasing thereafter; al-
though the basal levels were not recovered (Figures 4A and
4B). To demonstrate that indeed the dbcAMP effect on Hes5

expression was mediated though Notch1, cells were exposed
to dbcAMP during 48 h in the presence of the -secretase
inhibitor DAPT and a clear reduction in Hes5 was evident,
and this effect is even more pronounced when the dbcAMP-
treated cells were exposed to both DAPT and H89 (Figure 4C).
PKA-Notch signaling is required for the
astrocytic character: Notch involvement in
astrocytic differentiation
Astrocytic differentiation upon dbcAMP treatment in C6 cells
has been well established. In our hands, the differentiation
markers GFAP and S100 mRNA levels also reached their
maximum by the first and second day after treatment, re-
spectively (Figure 5A). Interestingly, GFAP mRNA expression
decreased during the following days of treatment, whereas
S100 levels remained fairly stable. Nevertheless, the expres-
sion of both markers was always above basal levels shown
by non-treated controls (followed and harvested at the same
time/conditions in each case, see Figure legend). Similar to
GFAP mRNA expression, GLAST mRNA showed an increase
after the first day of treatment that gradually declined
throughout the differentiation period. Accordingly, GLAST
function detected through [3H]D-aspartate uptake was also
increased (Figure 5B). Interestingly, while GLAST mRNA levels
decreased after day 1, the [3H]D-aspartate uptake activity in-
creased during the differentiation program (Figure 5B). Mor-
phological changes were also present with dbcAMP (750 M)
treatment. A bipolar to stellate-like phenotype was observed
from the first day of treatment. The cell body decreased grad-
ually and reached its minimum at day seven; conversely, the
length of cell elongations was also gradually augmented (Fig-
ure 5C). Additionally, a progressive disappearance of nestin,
the intermediate filament marker for neural precursor cells
was also noticed (data not shown).
To confirm that PKA signaling is upstream of the Notch
pathway signaling in astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells,
GLAST function ([3H]D-aspartate uptake) and GFAP transcrip-
tion were challenged with H89 and DAPT inhibitors and both
were effectively blocked (Figure 6). We then decided to ex-
plore the effects of H89 and DAPT directly on the activity
of the GFAP promoter. As expected, dbcAMP increased GFAP
promoter transcription by 2-fold; however, this effect was di-
minished upon PKA or Notch receptor blockage by 50% and
100%, respectively, suggesting that PKA-mediated effects
are partly dependent on Notch-1. To test this interpretation,
cells were pre-exposed to DAPT and H89 at the same time.
Co-transfection assays were performed with 1.25 g of 4xwtCBF1Luc or 4xmtCBF1Luc and 3.75 g of NICD expressing vector (pFCDN1
and the pEF1a-BOS empty vector used as controls). (B) At 24 h after transfection with 0.5 g of 4xwtCBF1Luc vector, cultures were
treated with dbcAMP (750 M) or forskolin (FSK, PKA inductor, indicated concentrations) for another 24 h; inhibitors were added 30 min
before dbcAMP or FSK. (C) C6 cells were transfected with 2 g of pCRE-CAT reporter construct, and 24 h after transfection treated with
dbcAMP or FSK (as indicated) for another 24 h. In all cases, data are shown as relative to the activities in the non-treated (NT) control
or the control co-transfected with the empty vector. (D) Total RNA was obtained from C6 cells treated as indicated and processed for
qRT-PCR to amplify a 173 bp fragment from PEN-2 mRNA (nucleotides 143­315), using GAPDH levels as reference. Data are plotted
relative to values recorded in non-treated (NT) and DMSO controls. (E) Approximately 100 g of total protein extract from C6 cells
treated with dbcAMP (750 M, 2 days), were used for Western blot analysis with anti-PEN-2 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. Molecular
masses are depicted on the right side. In all cases, data are plotted as means+

data for each day/harvest with the respective non-treated control where cell viability was used to adjust uptake) in (A). In (B), total
RNA was obtained from C6 cells treated as indicated and processed for qRT-PCR to amplify a 150 bp fragment from GFAP mRNA
(nucleotides 324­473), a 157 bp fragment from S100 mRNA (nucleotides 144­300), a 120 bp fragment from GLAST mRNA (nucleotides
1520­1639), and using GAPDH levels as reference. mRNA levels were normalized for each day with data from the paired non-treated
control, harvested in each point. Data are plotted as means+
-S.E.M. from at least three independent experiments and relative to values
recorded in non-treated (NT) control harvested at the end of the treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric
one-way ANOVA (Kurskal­Wallis test) and Dunn's post-hoc test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (C) C6 cells were treated with
dbcAMP (750 M, indicated times) and then immunostained with anti-GFAP (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
Images were obtained using confocal and phase contrast microscopy (scale bar = 25 m).
The results are shown in Figure 6(B), where a complete in-
hibition of the dbcAMP response was detected. These results
suggest that GFAP is a target gene for the cAMP/PKA and
Notch pathways, although Notch1 does not mediate all of
the PKA effect.
PKA-Notch signaling is required for Notch1
expression
Control, non-differentiated C6 cells present membrane and
cytoplasmic Notch1, which increases after dbcAMP exposure
(Figures 1A, 7A and 7B). Notch1 mRNA levels are significantly
increased after 2 days of dbcAMP treatment to progressively
decrease in the following days, returning to almost basal
levels at day seven (Figure 7B). Protein detection confirmed
this observation (Figure 7C). Notch1 increase was abrogated
when PKA activation or Notch receptor cleavage were inhib-
ited. The inhibitory effect was also observed when a combi-
nation of DAPT and H89 was used (Figure 7D), pointing out
that Notch1 receptor expression is under the control of the
cross-talk between PKA and Notch pathways in the process
of astrocytic differentiation in C6 cells.

number of research teams. A fine tuning of the ratio of
neurons to glia cells is needed for the proper development
of the neuronal circuits (Chenn, 2009). An established role
for PACAP in gliogenesis is well documented; under physio-
logical conditions increased cAMP levels regulate GFAP gene
expression (Tatsuno et al., 1996). Furthermore, it has been re-
ported that PAC1 activation initiates morphological changes
represented as process elongation in NPCs. Interestingly, in
this system, the IP3
(inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate)/PKC (protein
kinase C) pathway, rather than the cAMP/PKA cascade is
involved in the induction of an astrocyte-like morphology
(Nishimoto et al., 2007).
In the C6 cell model system, increasing cAMP levels ac-
tivates PKA, stimulates IL-6 production, and consequently
increases GFAP transcription via a PKA-CREB and JAK-STAT3
signaling cascade (Takanaga et al., 2004). Notch signaling is
another key pathway implicated in astrogenesis (de la Pompa
et al., 1997; Hitoshi et al., 2002; Yoon and Gaiano, 2005). With
this in mind, we decided to test whether these two signal-
ing systems overlap in C6 differentiation. To our surprise,
we found that the non-hydrolysable cAMP analog, dbcAMP,
triggers Notch signaling in a PKA-dependent manner. Al-
though undifferentiated C6 cells express Notch ligands (data
not shown), a barely detectable Notch activity is present in
these cells independently of their confluence. In sharp con-
trast, dbcAMP exposure leads to an efficient NICD nuclear
translocation and NICD/RBPJ-dependent transcription. Thus
far, NICD/RBPJk has been known to be activated only by the
receptor­ligand interaction (Blaumueller et al., 1997). How-
ever, during vascular development, increased cAMP levels
lead to Notch pathway activation to induce arterial endothe-
lial cells from vascular progenitors (Yurugi-Kobayashi et al.,
2006).
Our results suggest that C6 cells are useful for the study of
astrocyte differentiation. The exposure of C6 cell monolayers
to dbcAMP induces astrocytic morphological changes and
the expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP, S100
and GLAST (Figure 5). A concomitant increase in [3H]D-
aspartate uptake and a down-regulation of nestin expression
(data not shown), an accepted marker for NSCs (neural stem
cells) or glial progenitors (Mignone et al., 2004), confirms the
role of dbcAMP in astrocyte differentiation (Tatsuno et al.,
1996; Takanaga et al. 2004; Nakamachi et al., 2011). S100
and GFAP were also used as astrocytic markers because radial
glia or adult NSCs do not express S100, and oligodendro-
cytes do not express GFAP (Hachem et al. 2005; Cahoy et al.
2008). GFAP is also expressed by adult NSCs and radial glia
(Patten et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2006), whereas S100 can be
found in mature oligodendrocytes (Hachem et al., 2005).
GFAP mRNA levels are higher by day one and decreased
through the following days. GFAP protein half-life is high
(approximately 21 days) and only a pool of mRNA to pro-
duce GFAP protein and assembly filaments to form astrocytic
shape seems to be necessary (Rolland et al., 1990). In contrast,
S100 mRNA levels reached the maximum by the second day
and keep at this level through the seven days. S100 has

been implicated in the regulation of microtubule assembly
of type III intermediate filaments (Brozzi et al., 2009; Raponi
et al., 2007). Supporting this, Raponi et al. (2007) demon-
strated that the S100 expression defines a late develop-
mental stage after which GFAP-expressing cells (astrocytic
precursors) lose their NSC potential. We also found an in-
creased astrocytic function represented by [3H]D-aspartate
uptake activity (Flott and Seifert, 1991), with an uptake in-
creased since day two and reaching maximum at 5­7 days
after treatment, and observed that GLAST mRNA increased
by the first day after dbcAMP and dramatically decreases to
basal levels over the next day of treatment. It seems that,
similar to GFAP, only a pool of GLAST mRNA is necessary to
accelerate the glutamate transporter. Other possibility is that
GLT1 glutamate transporter in C6 cells (Baber and Haghighat,
2010) is contributing to the uptake.

Figure 8 Current model
cAMP/PKA/CREB and NICD/RBPJ signaling regulate the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP and the Notch pathway components
(Notch1 receptor and Hes5 transcription factor) during astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells.
It is important to mention that PKA activation was neces-
sary for Notch pathway activation (Figures 2­4). At this stage,
the obvious question of the mechanism involved in cAMP-
Notch activation arose. In this context, it is known that Notch
receptor cleavage is regulated by the -secretase complex,
and that this activity is regulated by auto-proteolysis of pre-
senilin (the catalytic subunit) initiated by PEN-2 assembly
(Marlow et al., 2003; Bammens et al., 2011). Interestingly,
PEN-2 regulation, and thus -secretase assembly, depends on
the CREB transcription factor (Wang et al., 2006) providing a
clue for the interpretation of the present results. During C6
exposure to dbcAMP, PEN-2 is transcriptionally up-regulated
via CREB (Figure 3). PEN-2 might be the link between PKA and
the Notch pathway, since this component is fundamental in
presenilin activation in the -secretase complex (Takeo et al.,
2012). Accordingly, PEN-2 mRNA levels under dbcAMP treat-
ment increase by the first day of treatment, reaching a maxi-
mum by day 2 (Figures 3D and 3E), therefore it is quite possi-
ble that PKA augments presinilin-1 levels in our system as has
been shown to occur in neurons (Mitsuda et al. 2001a, 2001b).
During embryonic development, Hes1 is expressed in the
early stages of neuroepithelial cell differentiation to pre-
vent precocious neurogenesis. In contrast, Hes5 is expressed
in the late stages, exactly when radial glia undergo the so-
called astrocytic conversion (reviewed in Ohtsuka et al., 1999;
Kageyama and Ohtsuka, 1999; Kageyama et al., 2008). Inter-
estingly, in the C6 cell culture system, the cAMP-triggered
Notch pathway results in Hes5, but not Hes1, expression
(data not shown). Through the analysis of Hes5 expression,
we confirmed that PKA is upstream of Notch activation and
capable of regulating Hes5 expression, most likely to block
pro-neuronal gene expression in glial progenitors.
The involvement of PKA in C6 astrocytic differentiation
was demonstrated by its participation in the regulation of
GFAP and Notch1 receptor genes; both directly, through
CREB activation, and indirectly, through Notch receptor
cleavage and then NICD/RBPJ activation. Independent
studies have demonstrated that CREB and NICD/RBPJ regu-
late GFAP expression, Ge and co-workers have demonstrated
that both STAT3 [activated by a LIF (leukemia inhibitory

PKA-mediated Notch activation
factor)-JAK stimulus] and NICD/RBPJ are independent path-
ways that regulate GFAP expression (Ge et al., 2002). Our
results demonstrate that the NICD/RBPJ complex and CREB
co-operate to regulate GFAP expression. It is quite possible
that CREB and NICD/RBPJ enhance transcription through
the recruiting of chromatin-remodeling factors. A plausible
explanation would be the recruitment of NICD by interac-
tion with the phosphorylated form of CREB, and consequent
binding of the co-activator p300 (HAT). Such a mechanism
has indeed been described for the regulation of granzyme B
expression in CD8+ T lymphocytes (Maekawa et al., 2008).
Considering that, once activated, the Notch1 receptor sig-
nals only once, it can be stated that this pathway strictly
depends on receptor availability. In fact, the mechanisms
of transcriptional regulation of the Notch1 receptor during
neurogenesis and gliogenesis have been suggested (Aguirre
et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2010). Therefore it is not surpris-
ing that in C6 cells, dbcAMP regulates Notch1 expression
at the transcriptional level (Figure 7). Furthermore, the in-
crease in Notch1 by PKA activity suggests the establishment
of a positive-feedback loop that could complement our un-
derstanding of the neurogenesis/gliogenesis switch in the
development of the CNS. A working model of our findings is
depicted in Figure 8.
