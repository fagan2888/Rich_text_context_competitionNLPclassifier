and Older Adults: Intersecting Forms and
Time Commitments

Objectives. This study investigated the latent structure of productive activity among middle-aged and older adults.
Whereas most researchers have examined forms of productive activity as discrete behaviors, our approach captured the
reality that many persons engage in more than one activity and commit varying degrees of time to these activities.
Methods. We took the data for this study from the Americans' Changing Lives survey. The activities examined include
formal volunteer work, informal help to others, unpaid domestic work, caregiving, and paid work. We describe the
complex clusters of activities and time commitment to those activities using latent class cluster analysis.
Results. Our results demonstrated that a four-cluster model fit the data well. Specifically, the findings showed that
middle-aged and older adults fell into four clusters: helpers, home maintainers, worker/volunteers, and super helpers. We
also show how individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race) are associated with the likelihood of being in one of these
four groups.
Discussion. This measurement strategy provides a foundation for future research into how experts can employ
productive activity clusters to understand better well-being across the life course. This is important because our results
show that many activities do not occur independently but rather are linked in patterned ways.
INTEREST in the study of productive activity in later life has
grown substantially over the past two decades. Butler and
Gleason (1985) are credited with putting this issue on the
agenda of scholars and policy makers; however, scholarly
interest in activity in later life has had a long history (e.g.,
Cutler, 1977; Havighurst, 1961; Maddox, 1963, 1979). Some of
the recent interest in productive activity in later life has stem-
med from the sheer economic value of these activities, much of
which does not result from activity in the paid labor market. For
example, for adults of all ages, estimates indicate that, for
volunteering and caregiving combined, the total economic
value is more than $400 billion annually (Arno, Levine, &
Memmott, 1999; Independent Sector, 2001).
Scholars tend to treat productive activities as discrete phe-
nomena; less commonly, they have examined how one activity
is related to another. Given that many persons are engaged in
more than one activity at specific stages in the life course, it is
plausible that some activities may group together in patterned
ways. Other activities may be less likely to be engaged in at the
same time. If some activities are complementary and others are
in competition with one another, it is reasonable to anticipate
that different types of activities may cluster together. We are
not aware of any attempt to understand if and how multiple
productive activities may be related to one another, especially
with the goal of determining whether there is a latent structure
that captures the complex way that forms of activity and time
committed to these activities may be related. If these clusters
exist, they will have conceptual interest, help researchers to
understand better these socially valuable behaviors, and ulti-
mately, allow scholars to show how this behavior is related to
older persons' well-being. Furthermore, if meaningful clusters
exist, scholars may be able to increase their understanding of
the discretionary and obligatory nature of productive activity
(e.g., Van Willigen, 2000) and whether certain activities are
competing or complementary (e.g., Scharlach, 1994).
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
productive activity clusters exist for a nationally representative
sample of middle-aged and older persons. The central question
in this study was the following: Do specific types of productive
activity in later life cluster together in meaningful ways? We
assumed that some activities would be linked to one another
such that participation in one type of activity may be positively
associated with participation in another. We saw other activities
as being in competition with one another and thus less likely to
cluster together. We examined data from the Americans'
Changing Lives (ACL) survey and employed latent class
cluster analysis (LCA) to determine whether latent classes of
productive activity existed. We also used logistic regression
techniques to investigate how these clusters were associated
with individual characteristics.
Research has shown that older Americans remain productive
deep into the later stages of their lives. Caro and colleagues
(e.g., Caro & Bass, 1997) were among the first scholars to
demonstrate that a considerable amount of productivity occurs
in the postretirement years, albeit largely unpaid in nature. Caro
and Bass (1995), using the Commonwealth Foundation Survey
of Productive Aging, found that between ages 55 and 74 older
persons remain remarkably active in a number of dimensions of
productive aging (defined as volunteering, child care, informal
help to friends, relatives and neighbors, caregiving, paid work,

and education). Even after age 75, nearly 20% of their sample
reported volunteering, helping children and grandchildren, or
providing care to sick and disabled persons.
Klumb and Baltes (1999), employing data from the Berlin
Aging Study, defined productive activity as specific activities in
which the respondents had engaged the day before the interview;
these included domestic activity (home maintenance and
housework), errands, gardening, paid work, and helping others
(including caregiving and formal volunteering). Based on this list
of activities, they found that more than 90% of persons aged 70 to
84 and nearly 80% of those 85 and older participated in
productive activities. Glass, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, and Berk-
man (1995), using panel data from the MacArthur Research
Network Study and defining productive activities as housework,
paid work, yard work, child care, and volunteering, discovered a
substantial amount of stability in productive behavior over a 3-
year period for a cohort of persons aged 70 to 79. Herzog and
colleagues, using data from the ACL study, also reported that
productive activity is maintained throughout the adult life course
(e.g., Herzog, Kahn, Morgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989).
These authors defined productive activity as volunteer work,
informal help, home maintenance, and housework.
Our definition of productive activity is any socially valued
activity that produces goods and services, whether paid or not
(Bass & Caro, 2001). Another way to think about unpaid
productive activities (e.g., volunteering) is that if someone does
not perform an important activity, someone else would have to
be paid to do it (Morgan, 1986). For this study, we focused on
volunteering; informal help in the form of provision of goods
and services to relatives, friends, and neighbors; informal
caregiving; unpaid work necessary for home maintenance; and
paid work. We excluded child care provided to children living
within the respondent's home because a very small percentage
of persons in the age group evaluated here were involved in this
activity. However, we did include child care provided for
children who did not live in the respondent's home when we
defined it as being part of informal help given to relatives,
friends, and neighbors.
Paid work. --An extensive literature has documented
patterns of participation in the paid workforce, especially
among age and gender groups, demonstrating both gender
differentiation in work behavior and a distinctive age curve in
participation. Herzog and colleagues (1989) reported a typical
finding: Participation over the age range resembles an inverted
U--men and women increase their paid work activities as they
approach midlife, then reduce or eliminate paid work as they
enter late life (see also Szafran, 2002). Paid work is less com-
mon beyond the age of 70 or 75 but does occur among a
significant minority of the population (Szafran, 2002).
Caregiving. --Among the specific types of productive acti-
vity, gerontologists have addressed the caregiving issue exten-
sively. Research has demonstrated that many individuals during
their lifetimes provide some caregiving to a family member or
friend, and that a sizable minority is extensively absorbed in
caregiving (Doty, Jackson, & Crown, 1998). Herzog and col-
leagues (1989) showed that caregiving most commonly occurs
among middle-aged individuals, who likely provide care to
their parents, and among older individuals, many of whom
provide care for a spouse. Women are somewhat more likely
than men to provide direct care, with men's participation often
occurring at the level of coordinating care for others (e.g.,
Johnson & LoSasso, 2000).
Informal help. --Providing informal help to neighbors,
friends, and family members, usually on a sporadic basis and
including such activities as running errands, providing trans-
portation, and helping with chores or child care, is common
among American adults. Researchers normally measure assis-
tance of this type with reference to help provided to others
outside of the household (Hogan, Eggebeen, & Clogg, 1993).
These activities are very common forms of productive behavior
for all age groups, but some research has shown a decline over
the adult age range (Herzog et al., 1989).
Formal volunteering. --Persons typically do volunteer work,
defined as ``unpaid work on the part of an individual or a group
of individuals with the intent of benefiting others . . . with
whom one has no contractual, familial, or friendship obliga-
tion'' (Van Willigen, 2000, p. S308), within the context of
a formal organizational structure. Formal volunteer activity of
this kind is considerably less common in the population than
informal help provided to friends and neighbors, but it occurs
among one quarter to one half of the population among adult
age groups (Wilson, 2000). Participation is most common among
persons at midlife stages of the life course (Hendricks & Cutler,
2004), but the amount of time committed to volunteering
among the oldest volunteers is often extensive (Hendricks &
Cutler, 2004).
Home maintenance and housework. --Domestic activity,
work done around and inside the home, is another form of
unpaid productive activity. Many dimensions of domestic activ-
ity are not optional. For example, if a person does not perform
some forms of routine maintenance on the structure of the
housing unit, safety and security may be at risk and the economic
value of the house may depreciate. Both men and women
participate in unpaid work around the home, but the kinds of
work they do are often quite different (see Shelton & John,
1996). In general, women tend to specialize in activities that
must be done routinely inside the home, such as laundry, food
preparation, and cleaning. Men are more likely to specialize in
activities that are done outside of the home, such as yard
maintenance and home and auto repairs. Nevertheless, Herzog
and colleagues (1989) provided evidence showing that most men
and women across all age groups participate at some level in
household maintenance or improvement activities.
Clustering of productive activities. --The clustering of
productive activities in later life is conditioned in complex
ways by two characteristics: whether the activities are
complementary or in competition with one another with respect
to time commitments and opportunities and, to a lesser degree,
whether the participant views the activities as discretionary or
obligatory. From a time-use standpoint, all productive activities
are potentially in competition with one another. Given the
constraints of a 24-hr day, more time spent on any one activity
implies less time spent on others (multitasking notwithstand-
ing). However, time-use studies have also suggested a great

deal of variation across the life course in how people use their
time and in the extent to which discretionary time is available
(Krantz-Kent, 2005). In the United States, as in other indus-
trialized countries, most people have a considerable amount of
discretionary time available during the typical week that they
may commit to leisure, self-improvement, social, or productive
activities. When considering the question of competing versus
complementary activities, the joint issues of type of activity and
time contributed are especially salient.
Discretionary activities are optional, determined in part on the
basis of preferences and lifestyle. Formal volunteering and
informal help given to persons in the community are examples of
activity that most people consider discretionary. Volunteering for
a religious organization or local hospital is not required, although
some persons may respond to normative pressures to do so
(Wilson & Musick, 1997a). Religious persons may feel com-
pelled to volunteer at their church or synagogue, blurring the
distinction between obligatory and discretionary. Individuals see
obligatory activities as compulsory, leaving them with little
choice about whether to participate, based in part on societal
norms about whether the activity should be taken on. Caregivers
and others often characterize caregiving, especially for a close
relative, as a form of obligatory activity. Society expects spouses,
for example, to provide care directly, or to orchestrate care
provided by others, to a husband or wife when necessary.
One way to frame the understanding of which activities
cluster together based on whether they compete with or com-
plement each other and whether they are discretionary versus
obligatory is to consider the social roles in which persons
engage following from the master statuses they occupy during
the adult life course. A common set of social roles for predict-
ing types and levels of productive activity is linked to one's
family status. Being part of a family implies a set of behaviors
linked to engagement in productive activity. For instance,
marriage implies obligations for husbands and wives to engage
in tasks that are supportive of their family. When a person
becomes a parent, he or she is expected to provide care for the
child or arrange to have someone else provide care. Similarly,
being a middle-aged child of an ailing parent implies a com-
mitment to provide help when needed, at least on a nominal
level. Most of the extant research has shown that caregiving
(obligatory) behavior is in competition with work, especially
full-time work, and other activities, like volunteering (discre-
tionary). Yet, recent evidence has shown that under some
circumstances, engaging in caregiving and volunteering is not
unusual and in fact may be considered complementary to one
another (Burr, Choi, Mutchler, & Caro, 2005).
Another master status with implications for how social roles
condition participation in unpaid productive activities is a
person's relationship with the paid labor market. Through
economic necessity and social policy, most adults are
encouraged (obliged) to participate in the labor market to
generate income to meet basic and higher order needs, or they
depend on someone who does. Because paid work, especially
full-time work, often represents a heavy time commitment, it is
considered to be in competition with many other activities,
especially caregiving (e.g., Doty et al., 1998). Individuals
engaged in heavy caregiving activities--those taking primary
responsibility for a severely disabled parent or spouse, for
instance--engage in many trade-offs with respect to time
allocation. Thus, providing extensive care to others is often
``incompatible with full-time, paid employment at midlife''
(Johnson & LoSasso, 2000, p. 5). Paid work and caregiving are
examples of two activities considered to be obligatory and in
competition with one another, especially when both require heavy
time commitments.
However, engagement in the paid labor market may
be complementary with discretionary activities, such as
volunteering for formal organizations. This is possible when
such behaviors are an extension of employment-related social
networks (Mutchler, Burr, & Caro 2003; Wilson & Musick,
1997b). Persons engaging in paid work may enjoy broader and
more diverse networks that provide the potential to learn about
many different types of volunteer or informal helping
opportunities. Gauthier and Smeeding (2000) found that
individuals who were employed full time spent more time on
unpaid work (including activities such as volunteering but not
housework) on their off-days than did nonworkers during their
typical day, suggesting that paid work and volunteering in the
community complement one another. This is a case where one
may combine the obligatory nature of work in complementary
ways with the discretionary behavior of formal volunteering.
The goal of this study was to assess whether specific
activities are likely to cluster together and, if so, whether these
clusters have conceptual meaning, especially with respect to
whether the activities are complementary or in competition with
one another and whether the activities are considered to be
discretionary or obligatory. We also explored how personal
characteristics, such as age, gender, race, functional status, and
economic status, are associated with the likelihood of being in
specific clusters of productive activity.
METHODS
Data
We took the data for this study from the ACL survey, a
nationally representative panel survey with a multistage area
probability sample design. This survey collected information
from 3,617 respondents aged 25 and older in 1986 (Wave 1),
oversampling for Blacks and individuals older than 60. For the
LCA, the data were not weighted. However, for the multi-
nomial logistic regression analysis, the data were weighted. For
this study, we used data from Wave 1 (1986). We focused on
middle-aged and older adults aged 55 and older. Throughout
the survey, there were very few missing values (except for
income, for which 11.4% of cases contained missing infor-
mation). In cases where missing data were present, the survey
staff at the Institute for Social Research (University of
Michigan) employed a variety of techniques to impute values.
Our study used the cleaned and imputed variables as re-
commended by the survey staff (House, 2003). The final study
sample size was 1,896, which included all individuals in the
sample aged 55 and older.
The ACL survey was appropriate for this analysis because (a)
it includes information on a wide range of productive activities
(including amount of time given to the activities), (b) we may
compare our results to the existing large number of studies that
have also used these data, and (c) the database includes a useful
set of controls. Thus the ACL data are among the best available
PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY CLUSTERS S269
for a study like this one. We based our assessment of the
underlying structure of productive activity on reports of partic-
ipation in these activities, as well as hours spent engaging in
each activity annually. We evaluated both dimensions of these
activities because each tells us something different about these
behaviors. Participation in productive activities, such as volunteer-
ing for an organization or helping a neighbor, even if only
sporadically, has important social and individual benefits. We
assert that amount of time engaged in each activity implies
a level of commitment to the activity. Competition among activ-
ities is more likely to occur when multiple activities involve
heavy time demands.
Measures
We included five measures of productive activity to
investigate the latent structure underlying these observed
(manifest) behaviors: paid work, volunteering, caregiving,
informal helping, and home maintenance. Table 1 contains
the relevant verbatim survey items. We defined paid work as
employment in the labor market for pay. Based on reported
hours worked, we grouped paid work into three categories: 0 ¼
none; 1 ¼ 1 to 1,999 hr (low, considered part-time work where
respondent worked, on average, less than 40 hr per week for 50
weeks); 2 ¼ 2,000 hr or more (high, considered full-time work
where respondent worked, on average, 40 hr per week or more
for 50 weeks). In preliminary analyses, we examined other
strategies for categorizing work hours (e.g., 35 hr per week
representing full-time work). The coefficients from the LCA
changed very little, and the substantive interpretation of the
relationships among the productive activity variables remained
the same (results available upon request).
Volunteering included committing time to schools, religious
groups, political entities, senior centers, and other organizations
such as hospitals. Caregiving included helping or arranging for
help for someone with a physical or mental illness, disability, or
some other health issue. Informal helping included providing
occasional assistance to friends, neighbors, and relatives with such
activities as transportation and running errands. Home mainte-
nance included doing home and auto repairs, as well as gardening
and yard work. These types of home maintenance activities were
sometimes more concentrated among men than women (86.5%
and 71.3%, respectively, in our study sample). We considered
using housework as an indicator of productive activity. More than
93% of our study sample engaged in this activity, and preliminary
analysis demonstrated that including this activity in the LCA did
not help to discriminate among respondents with respect to
clustering of activities. Thus, we did not include this activity in our
analyses. ACL respondents reported hours spent over the previous
12 months in volunteering, caregiving, informal helping, and
home maintenance in five categories. Because of the presence of
some small sample sizes for some categories, we reduced the
categories to three: 0¼no hours (none); 1¼10, 30, 60, or 120 hr
(low); 2 ¼ 200 hr or more (high). The ACL data include only
broad categories of time commitment to these activities, which
limited our measurement options.
After estimating the latent class cluster model (see below),
which resulted in a classification of individuals into one of sev-
eral types of activity patterns, we investigated whether specific
demographic, social, economic, and health characteristics were
related to the likelihood of being in one of the productive activity
types. We included age in these models, collapsed into three
groups: 55 to 64 (reference group in regression analysis), 65 to
74, and 75 years old and older. We measured gender as female (1)
and male (0). Race was White (1) and non-White (0). We cate-
gorized marital status as married (1) or not married (0). We
dichotomized education into high school education or more (1)
and less than a high school education (0). Family income
was $25,000 or more annually (1) and less than $25,000 (0). We
based functional status on a dichotomous variable indicating
whether the respondent reported having difficulty with one or

stairs, or doing heavy work around the house.
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the study sample
based on the observed indicators of productive activity and the
other variables. The most common productive activity reported in
our sample of middle-aged and older persons was do-it-yourself
home maintenance (77.8%), followed by informal helping
(68.3%). The least common activity was providing or arranging
for care for persons with chronic mental or physical health
problems (18.7%). Approximately one third of individuals aged
55 and older engaged in paid work or volunteering. The mean age
of the sample was 67.3 years, with a majority of respondents
being female, White, and married, and reporting at least a high
school education. Only one third reported an annual family
income greater than $25,000, and more than 4 of every 10 persons
reported at least one limitation with activities of daily living.
Analytic Strategy
We investigated the underlying structure of productive
activity with an exploratory model based on LCA to determine
empirically whether a typology existed regarding the clustering
of home-based and community-based activities (Vermunt &
Magidson, 2002). LCA is related to more common forms of
cluster analysis (e.g., K-means) but has the added advantages of
assigning individuals to classes based on probabilities estimated
from the model and providing model fit statistics for choosing
among models. LCA is less restrictive than other forms of
cluster analysis in that it does not assume linearity, normally
distributed data, or homogeneity of variances. A key assump-
tion is that the classes estimated from the models have local
independence; that is, within each class, the indicators are
assumed to be independent of each other. This is another way
of saying that the latent variable explains why the observed
indicators are related to one another. (For a more detailed
discussion of the statistical underpinnings of latent class cluster
models, see Vermunt & Magidson, 2002.) The basic model is
f ðyi
Þ ¼
X
k
pðx ¼ kÞf ðyi
jx ¼ kÞ; ð1Þ
where yi
is a vector of dependent or endogenous indicators for
case i, x is a nominal latent variable, and k denotes a class (k ¼
1,2,. . .,K). We identified the best fitting model and interpreted
the specific clusters from this model through an examination of
the conditional probabilities (similar to factor loadings in factor
analysis). We employed Latent Gold 3.0 software to estimate
the LCA models (Vermunt & Magidson, 2003).
To describe further the structure of productive activity, we
estimated multinomial logistic regression models using the
covariates described earlier. This allowed us to demonstrate
how a set of common personal characteristics was associated
with the probability of location in one of the latent classes of
productive activity. We do not argue here that this is an
exhaustive model; we include this analysis for descriptive
purposes. We adjusted standard errors of the regression
coefficients to account for the complex sample design of the
ACL by employing the SVYMLOGIT routine in STATA 8.1.
RESULTS
The first task was to identify a best fitting LCA model.
Preliminary analysis showed that in one instance the assump-
tion of local independence was violated. Evaluation of bivar-
iate residuals indicated that volunteering and working for pay
were likely to be directly associated with each other instead
of indirectly through the latent class (violating the principle of
local independence). This was possibly due to the influence of
an unobserved variable or measurement error in the original
data. Consequently, we estimated a restricted LCA allowing
volunteering and working for pay to have direct effects on one
another. To identify the best fitting model among a group of
likely models, it was necessary to consider several parameters.
Table 3 presents the parameters for this task.
We evaluated four parameters for choosing a model that best
represents the latent structure of productive activity: p value,
likelihood ratio (L2) and degrees of freedom (df), Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC) estimate, and classification error. An
evaluation of these statistics showed that a one-cluster model
did not fit the data. The rule of thumb for choosing the best
fitting model is that the p value be greater than .05, the
likelihood ratio and degrees of freedom be close in value, the
BIC be small compared to other models with p values greater
than .05, and the classification errors be relatively low
compared to the other viable models. Using this approach, we
found that the best fitting model (and the most parsimonious)
was the four-cluster model (p ¼ .10, L2 ¼ 209.96 with 195 df,
BIC ¼ 15,141, and classification error of .23).

PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY CLUSTERS S271
The four clusters (or classes) of the model required both a
label and interpretation on the basis of the dominant activity
components contained within each, identified by the strength
of the conditional probabilities (see Table 4). As with naming
factors in a factor analysis, labeling clusters in a LCA represents
a certain level of subjectivity. Fornaming these clusters, we relied
on an inspection of the conditional probabilities to show which of
the activity types and amounts of time given to the activities
dominated in the specific cluster. The first productive activity
cluster, which we labeled helpers, contained 46.1% (unweighted
latent class probability) of the cases. An inspection of the con-
ditional probabilities indicated that persons in this cluster were
likely to commit a moderate amount of time to volunteering
and informal helping activities, as well as to participate in home
maintenance activity with a very low likelihood of participation
in caregiving or paid work. The second productive activity
cluster, home maintainers, contained 35.4% of the respondents.
Persons in this cluster showed a modest likelihood of partic-
ipation in home maintenance/do-it-yourself activities (e.g.,
yard work, auto maintenance, gardening) and a very low likeli-
hood of participation in the other forms of activity. In fact,
the probability that persons in this latent class cluster participated
in do-it-yourself home maintenance was lower than the prob-
ability for persons in the other clusters, and a subset of these
persons did not report participation in any of the five activities
considered here.
We labeled the third cluster worker/volunteers; it contained
14.9% of the middle-aged and older respondents in our study
sample. These persons demonstrated a moderate likelihood of
participation in paid work, a high likelihood of participation
in informal helping with a relatively high amount of time
committed, a moderate likelihood of participation in volunteer-
ing (formal helping) with a low amount of time committed, and
a high likelihood of participation in do-it-yourself activities
around the home with a low amount of time committed. These
persons showed a low likelihood of participating in caregiving
activities. We labeled the fourth cluster of productive activity
super helpers; this cluster contained 3.6% of the respondents.
Inspection of the conditional probabilities indicated that per-
sons in this class demonstrated a high likelihood of participa-
tion in informal helping with a high level of time commitment,
a moderate likelihood of participation in caregiving at a high
level, a moderate likelihood of volunteering, and a high
probability of participation in do-it-yourself home maintenance
activities. These persons also showed a low probability of
engagement in paid work.
To further investigate the latent structure of productive
activity, we report the results of a multinomial logistic regres-
sion model (see Table 5), demonstrating which individual
characteristics were associated with the likelihood of being in
a particular cluster (home maintainers served as the reference
group). We discuss only statistically significant effects. Net of
the other variables in the model, increasing age was related to
a lower likelihood of being in the helpers, worker/volunteers, or
super helpers clusters as compared to the home maintainers
cluster. Women were more likely than men to be in the home
maintainers versus the worker/volunteers cluster. Whites were
more likely than non-Whites to be in the helpers or super
helpers clusters as compared to in the home maintainers cluster.
Married persons and persons with higher education were more
likely than nonmarried persons and persons with lower
education, respectively, to be in the helpers cluster as compared
to the home maintainers cluster. Compared to persons in the
home maintainers cluster, persons with access to higher family
income were more likely than persons with lower family
income to be in the helpers, worker/volunteers, or super helpers
clusters. Finally, having at least one limitation with activities of
daily living increased the likelihood of being in the home
maintainers cluster as compared to being in either the helpers or
worker/volunteers clusters.
In Figure 1, we present predicted probabilities for each of
the four clusters of productive activity for three age groups,

providing a visual depiction of the relationship between these
variables. This approach demonstrates how the likelihood of
being in one of the four productive activity types is age graded.
The predicted probabilities were based on results from the
multinomial logistic regression model reported in Table 5. The
reference person was a White woman with at least a high school
education who was married with an income less than $25,000
and no reported limitations in functional status.
The figure reinforces the findings from Table 4: The most
common cluster of productive activity was helpers, and the
least common was super helpers. The figure also shows that the
probability of being in the helpers cluster was highest for
a ``typical'' respondent who was 65 to 74 years old, whereas the
probability of being in the home maintainers cluster was highest
for those who were 75 years old and older. The probability of
being in the worker/volunteers cluster or in the super helpers
cluster was highest for a person who was 55 to 64 years old.
There was a clear pattern of linear age grading (decreasing with
age) in terms of the likelihood of being in the worker/volunteers
or super helpers clusters, whereas age grading was also present
for home maintainers but in the opposite direction (increasing
with age). For the helpers cluster, the effect was curvilinear,
with the greatest likelihood of being in this group among those
in the middle age group (65­74).

PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY CLUSTERS S273
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates for these data with these indicators
that a latent structure of productive activity exists. LCA showed
that a four-cluster model captured the underlying relationships
among the productive activity indicators; the clusters included
helpers, home maintainers, worker/volunteers, and super help-
ers. The model indicated that activities like work and
volunteering are complementary, at least for some persons
(worker/volunteers); this finding is consistent with the current
literature (e.g., Wilson & Musick, 1997b). Persons in this
cluster combine obligatory and discretionary activities, imply-
ing to a degree that these are nonetheless complementary
activities. Also, engaging in formal volunteering and informal
volunteering (helpers), two discretionary activities, was com-
mon. Interestingly, a small group of persons appeared to be
heavily engaged in assisting others in productive ways (super
helpers). These persons seemed to mix obligatory and
discretionary activities and did so with a fairly high level of
time commitment. Further study of persons in this group may
find that they have unusually high motivation to help others
combined with the resources necessary to act on this motivation
(e.g., economic well-being).
Our results show evidence of age grading related to location
in specific productive activity classes. On the one hand, the
results demonstrate a compression, or reduction, of partici-
pation in three types of activity clusters (helpers, worker/
volunteers, and super helpers) as persons move from middle
age to later life. On the other hand, the results for the home
maintainers cluster show that the likelihood of being in this
group increases with age. To elaborate, we turn to the selective
optimization with compensation theory of successful aging
introduced by Paul and Margaret Baltes (Baltes & Baltes,
1990). This theory posits that as people age, they experience
reductions in biological, mental, and social reserves (with the
levels of reduction being variable across individuals). Older
persons adapt to this reality by reducing the number of domains
in which they function. Our findings showed that participation
in clusters of activities composed of activities outside the home
decreases as people get older and that participation in the
cluster defined by activity around the home increases as people
age. We believe this pattern provides some partial support for
the adaptive strategies predicted by the Baltes's selective
optimization with compensation theory framework. Further
research should determine if a similar latent variable of pro-
ductive activity varies in the number of activity classes across
the life course (e.g., analyses may yield evidence of different
productive activity clusters by major life course stage).
More generally, the field needs a better understanding of how
older people use their time and what factors drive these choices.
Improved understanding of the time use of older individuals
may also help to shed light on their roles in the community. A
preference among some older people to operate at a slower
pace, for example, may substantially narrow the range of activ-
ities that they carry out. If older persons prefer to devote more
time to basic living tasks (such as home maintenance), they
have less time available for other activities, such as volunteer-
ing. Furthermore, a preference for flexibility in use of time
may account for a reluctance to take on structured activities
that involve a regular commitment of time over an extended
period. Preferences for certain types of activity, based in part
on the meaning of the activity to the older person, likely influ-
ence the decision to participate in a given set of activities.
This is related to socioemotional selectivity theory, which hy-
pothesizes that as persons age they make conscious choices
to focus on activity that provides maximum emotional grati-
fication (see Carstensen, 1992; Hendricks & Cutler, 2004).
More research is needed on the preferences of elders in
responding to competing opportunities and the influence of
their sense of obligatory versus discretionary behaviors.
Earlier we alluded to the fact that people often engage in
multitasking, allowing them to participate in more than one
activity in an almost simultaneous manner. It is possible, for
example, for a person to pick up a medical prescription for an
infirm neighbor on the way to taking a grandchild to a medical
appointment and then on the return from the doctor's office to
pick up political pamphlets at a politician's headquarters to be
distributed upon return within the person's neighborhood. One
errand combines three forms of productive activity. This may be
one way in which some productive activities are functionally
complementary to one another. Furthermore, engagement in
multitasking behavior is increasing over time, and the in-
troduction of new technology (e.g., cell phones, handheld
computer devices) makes this form of activity even more likely
now (and in the future) than may have been possible at the time of
the ACL survey. It may be informative to determine if productive
activities cluster in the same way over historical periods of time.
It is important to replicate this study with different data
sources, along different points in the adult life course, and for
a different range of productive activity indicators to determine if
these yield a similar typology. LCA is a powerful technique for
this type of research, but the results may vary in important ways
under varying research design strategies. Given the presence of
an underlying latent structure of productive activity, it would be
informative to determine in future research efforts if a latent
variable of productive activity predicts variability in the many
domains of well-being in later life. Researchers could make use of
our findings to generate simple indexes of productive activity by
combining information about type of activity and amount of time
commitment. Scholars could then use these indexes to evaluate
a range of outcomes related to general well-being among the
middle-aged and older populations.
Both personal resources and cultural background may guide
experts' understanding of the productive activities in which older
persons choose to engage. Researchers are beginning to study the
ways in which productive activity may be related to various
dimensions of well-being (e.g., Chou & Chi, 2002; Glass,
Mendes de Leon, Marottoli, & Berkman, 1999; McIntosh &
Danigelis, 1995; Menec 2003), much in the same way that others
have shown how physical and social activity influence positive
outcomes in the later stages of the life course (e.g., Bassuk,
Glass, & Berkman, 1999). A brief list of research questions that
need to be addressed includes the following: To what degree are
clusters of productive activity associated with better (or worse)
mental and physical health? For example, are super helpers more
or less likely than home maintainers or worker/volunteers to
report high levels of self-rated health or life satisfaction? Are the
benefits (or detriments) of being in one productive aging cluster
versus another the same for different race and ethnic groups,
different birth cohorts, or different social classes? To what degree
BURR ET AL.
S274
are clusters of productive activity associated with differential
opportunities that result from community characteristics? In
addressing these questions, researchers will need to account for
the endogeneity and reciprocal causation that may exist between
clusters of activity and health. Researchers may also need to take
into account the interrelationship between socioeconomic status
and residential location.
The data used for this study, although substantively appro-
priate, were 20 years old. It is possible, even likely, that a
similar analysis of more recent data would yield different re-
sults given changes over time in technology (e.g., cell phones)
and lifestyles (e.g., telecommuting). With the increase in the
pace of everyday life, persons of all ages are likely to be
engaged in a broader array of productive activities. Thus, the
age of the ACL data may limit generalization of our findings to
today's middle-aged and later life populations.
