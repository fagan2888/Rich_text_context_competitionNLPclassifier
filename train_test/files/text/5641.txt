Introduction
Up to 75% of cancer patients experience some form of
cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) during cancer
treatments (eg, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hormone
therapy), and this impairment persists for months or up to
20 years in 20% to 35% of survivors.1 CRCI commonly
includes impairments in memory, executive function, atten-
tion, and concentration. Cancer survivors show altered
brain structure and function consistent with impairments in
CRCI domains.2-6 CRCI is associated with fatigue and other
symptoms and has an overall negative impact on quality of

Abstract
Background. Interventions are needed to alleviate memory difficulty in cancer survivors. We previously showed in a
phase III randomized clinical trial that YOCAS©® yoga--a program that consists of breathing exercises, postures, and
meditation--significantly improved sleep quality in cancer survivors. This study assessed the effects of YOCAS©® on
memory and identified relationships between memory and sleep. Study design and methods. Survivors were randomized
to standard care (SC) or SC with YOCAS©® . 328 participants who provided data on the memory difficulty item of
the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory are included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index. General linear modeling (GLM) determined the group effect of YOCAS©® on memory difficulty compared
with SC. GLM also determined moderation of baseline memory difficulty on postintervention sleep and vice versa.
Path modeling assessed the mediating effects of changes in memory difficulty on YOCAS©® changes in sleep and vice
versa. Results. YOCAS©® significantly reduced memory difficulty at postintervention compared with SC (mean change:
yoga=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). Baseline memory difficulty did not moderate the effects of postintervention sleep
quality in YOCAS©® compared with SC. Baseline sleep quality did moderate the effects of postintervention memory
difficulty in YOCAS©® compared with SC (P<.05). Changes in sleep quality was a significant mediator of reduced
memory difficulty in YOCAS©® compared with SC (P<.05); however, changes in memory difficulty did not significantly
mediate improved sleep quality in YOCAS©® compared with SC. Conclusions. In this large nationwide trial, YOCAS©®
yoga significantly reduced patient-reported memory difficulty in cancer survivors.

life.7-9 It also leads to increased difficulty at work10,11 and
reductions in social engagements and interferes with com-
pliance with cancer treatments.12-14 Although intervention
research for CRCI is emerging,15 there are currently no
effective management approaches for CRCI used in stan-
dard clinical practice. The widespread prevalence of CRCI
constitutes a significant clinical problem for which practical
and innovative interventions need to be investigated.
Research is also needed to assess whether improving mem-
ory might also help moderate and/or mediate improvements
in sleep and other symptoms.
Research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of exer-
cise, including yoga, on cognitive functioning and its asso-
ciation with fewer cognitive problems later in life among
healthy adults, those at risk for neurodegenerative disease,
and those with chronic conditions.16-21 Although yoga is a
promising intervention, the effect of yoga on cognitive
function has not been extensively evaluated in cancer
patients and survivors. Galantino et al22 have evaluated
yoga for cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients
receiving chemotherapy in a case series, showing improved
cognitive performance on objective tests of attention, exec-
utive function and memory, and perceived cognitive bene-
fits. Other studies have showed improvements in other
cancer-related symptoms, including fatigue, quality of life,
affect, sleep, and psychological distress.23-30
Some forms of exercise (or physical activity) are safe
and beneficial for cancer survivors, and yoga--a mode
of exercise--has become increasingly popular in this
population.31-35 Hatha yoga--the most widely used form of
yoga--includes a sequence of meditative, breathing, and
physical alignment exercises that require musculoskeletal
engagement. Restorative yoga is characterized by a combi-
nation of meditative, breathing, and physical alignment
exercises requiring the passive support of the body through
the use of props and is designed to promote deep relaxation.
We recently completed a phase III randomized clinical trial
(RCT) through the University of Rochester Cancer Center
(URCC) and Community Clinical Oncology Program
(CCOP) to investigate the effects of a combined Hatha and
Restorative yoga program, Yoga for Cancer Survivors
(YOCAS©® ), on sleep quality and efficiency in cancer
survivors posttreatment. We previously reported greater
improvements in global and subjective sleep quality, day-
time dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency,
and medication use at postintervention compared with con-
trols. Additionally, improvements in sleep latency, sleep
duration, and daytime dysfunction were specific to controls,
and medication use was reduced by 21% in yoga partici-
pants compared with 5% in controls. Therefore, we con-
cluded that the improvements in global sleep quality in
yoga participants may be related to reductions in daytime
dysfunction in terms of less napping, less fatigue, and better
sleep continuity, whereas any improvement in controls may
be related to continued sleep medication.30,36 Here, we
report a secondary data analysis investigating the effects of
YOCAS©® on memory difficulty. We have included
important covariates associated with memory function,
including age, education, race, and ethnicity and also
explored other covariates hypothesized to influence mem-
ory function in cancer survivors, including previous sur-
gery, previous chemotherapy, previous radiation therapy,
previous hormone therapy, and current hormone therapy.
We also explored moderating effects of memory difficulty
on postintervention sleep quality and vice versa and possi-
ble mediating effects of changes in memory on changes in
sleep quality and vice versa.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This is a secondary analysis of a previously completed trial,
of which the primary study results have been published
previously.30 This study was registered with clinical trials.
gov (NCT00397930). The URCC CCOP Research Base
and 9 CCOPs conducted a nationwide, multicenter, RCT
examining the efficacy of yoga for improving sleep quality
in adult cancer survivors. Survivors were recruited in
cohorts (n = 20-30), stratified by gender and baseline level
of sleep disturbance (2 levels: 5 or >5 on an 11-point clini-
cal symptom inventory scale anchored by 0 = no sleep dis-
turbance and 10 = worst possible sleep disturbance), and
randomly assigned to either a yoga or standard care (SC)
control group at each CCOP. Group assignment was deter-
mined by a computer-generated random number table in
blocks of 2 and 1:1 allocation ratio. The allocation was con-
cealed from the coordinator until after the participant was
registered by using a Web site that generated an e-mail to
the research base and individual CCOP site. The study pri-
mary investigator and biostatistician were blinded to alloca-
tion. Institutional review board approval was obtained from
the URCC CCOPResearch Base and all participating CCOP
recruitment sites, and informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Cancer survivors were recruited in 12 different US cities
by 9 CCOPs from November 2006 to July 2009. Participants
were enrolled between 2 and 24 months after completing
surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. For the
current analyses, the eligibility criteria were not modified.
Eligible survivors must (1) have a confirmed diagnosis of
any type of cancer; (2) have undergone standard treatment
for their cancer; (3) have completed all forms of standard
treatment for their cancer between 2 and 24 months prior to
consenting for the study and initiation of baseline assess-
ments (continued treatment with hormones or monoclonal
antibodies was allowed); (4) have persistent sleep distur-
bance (indicated by a response of 3 or greater on a clinical
Janelsins et al 265
symptom inventory using an 11-point scale anchored by 0 =
no sleep disturbance and 10 = worst possible sleep distur-
bance); (5) be able to read English; (6) be 21 years of age or
older; (7) be able to give written informed consent; (8) not
have maintained a regular personal practice of yoga within
the 3 months prior to enrolling in the study or be actively
planning to start yoga on their own; (9) not have a con-
firmed diagnosis of sleep apnea; (10) not be receiving any
form of treatment for cancer, with the exception of hor-
monal or monoclonal antibody therapy; and (11) not have
metastatic cancer.
Yoga Intervention
Yoga for Cancer Survivors, YOCAS©®, designed by
researchers at the University of Rochester, is a combined
Hatha and Restorative yoga program, which includes move-
ment, breath, and awareness. A full description of the pro-
gram is described in a previous publication,30 and key
information is provided herein. Postures include seated,
standing, transitional, and supine poses, with an emphasis
on restorative poses, and the program was taught with mod-
ifications to address multiple levels of experience. The
breathing exercises focused on regulation of breathing, and
the awareness component included meditation instruction,
visualization, and affirmation. The intervention was deliv-
ered in an instructor-taught group format over 8 sessions.
Each session was 75 minutes, and sessions occurred twice a
week during the late afternoon or evening at community-
based sites, including yoga studios, community centers, and
community oncology practices. Sessions were standardized
across CCOP sites and included physical alignment pos-
tures, breathing, and mindfulness exercises. Instructors
were Registered Yoga Alliance Instructors and each had to
complete a standardized training session and was provided
with a detailed YOCAS©® instructor manual and DVD. In
addition, a coordinator at each CCOP completes the stan-
dardized training session and randomly observes
YOCAS©® sessions to ensure proper content is taught.
Adherence to the intervention was good, with yoga par-
ticipants attending an average of 6.5 of the 8 sessions. Yoga
participants were also told that they could practice yoga that
they learned from class outside class. Exercise contamina-
tion in the control group was minimal.
Measures
Memory Difficulty
Perceived memory difficulty was assessed using the MD
Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). The MDASI is a
patient-reported clinical assessment tool used widely in can-
cer centers across the country. This measure, developed
by Cleeland and colleagues, assesses multiple symptom
outcomes for clinical and research use and applies to many
different cancer types. It is sensitive to the symptoms that
cancer patients experience and is sensitive to change in dis-
ease outcomes, quality of life, and performance status.Atotal
of 13 core items are present in this measure, and each is
assessed on a 11-point scale with 0 being not present to 10, as
bad as you can imagine. This tool is designed to be used to
assess a total symptom burden as well as individual systems
related to cancer and cancer treatments. Impairment can be
classified as none (score of 0), mild (score of 1-3), moderate
(score of 4-6), and severe (score of 7-10) or used as a con-
tinuous outcome. The MDASI has been psychometrically
validated with excellent test-retest reliability, internal consis-
tency, and convergent validity.37 In the current study, we
focus on the perceived cognitive function item "difficulty
remembering things" to assess perceived memory difficulty.
Sleep
Sleep quality was measured utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI), a psychometrically validated, patient-
reported, 19-item instrument.33 We utilized the global sleep
quality score for the moderation and mediation analyses
involving sleep variables because this was the primary
outcome measure in our previously published study.
Statistical Analyses
Main Analyses.Data analyses were conducted using SPSS
version 22 and MPlus version 9.2. General linear modeling
(GLM), controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, educa-
tion, baseline memory, and baseline sleep score (PSQI) as
covariates, was used to determine the group effect of
YOCAS©® on memory difficulty as compared with con-
trols. We included baseline PSQI as a covariate because
sleep disturbance was an entry criteria for the main trial.
Age, memory difficulty, and sleep scores were treated as
continuous variables, with gender, race, ethnicity, and edu-
cation as categorical variables. In a second model, we added
covariates of previous surgery, previous chemotherapy, pre-
vious radiation therapy, previous hormone therapy, and cur-
rent hormone therapy as binary (ie, yes/no) covariates. In all
cases, P < .05 was treated as significant.
Moderation Analyses. A moderator is a variable that influences
the strength of the relationship between 2 other variables.
Here, we assessed the influence of baseline sleep on postinter-
vention memory by intervention condition and vice versa. To
assess moderation of memory difficulty on sleep, we included
age, mean-centered baseline memory difficulty score, mean-
centered baseline PSQI, and mean-centered baseline memory
difficulty score by intervention condition arm (YOCAS©® vs
SC) interaction in our GLM model to evaluate moderation
significance on PSQI score at postintervention.38
266 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
To assess moderation of sleep on memory, we included
age, mean-centered baseline sleep, mean-centered baseline
memory, and mean-centered baseline sleep score by inter-
vention condition arm interaction in our GLM model to
evaluate moderation significance on memory difficulty
score at postintervention. IBM SPSS version 22 was used
for these calculations.
Mediation Analyses.A mediator is a variable that explains
partially or in its entirety a relationship between 2 other
variables. Here, we assessed the effect of changes in mem-
ory on the efficacy of the intervention on sleep quality and
vice versa. To determine the potential mediation effects of
changes in reduced memory difficulty from preintervention
to postintervention through YOCAS©® on improved sleep
and vice versa, we performed path modeling on change
scores for memory and sleep, to derive path coefficients
including age as a covariate. We first conducted 2 good-
ness-of-fit tests to determine model fit of memory mediat-
ing changes in sleep and vice versa. The memory mediation
model included a direct path between intervention condi-
tion arm (YOCAS©® vs SC) and sleep, a path between
intervention condition arm and memory, and a path between
memory and sleep. Age was also included as a covariate.
The sleep mediation model followed the same design, with
a direct path between intervention condition arm and mem-
ory, a path between arm and sleep, and a path between sleep
and memory. Age was also included as a covariate. Statisti-
cal significance of mediation was assessed through 95%
confidence intervals (obtained from 10000 bootstrap sam-
ples) for the indirect path coefficient from intervention con-
dition to memory on sleep and vice versa.39 Mplus version
9.2 was used for the calculations. In all cases, P < .05 deter-
mined statistical significance.
Results
Participant Characteristics
In the current study, 328 participants provided evaluable
memory difficulty data at baseline and postintervention
(Figure 1). Participants were predominantly female (96%)
and 54 years of age, on average, ranging from 26 to 72 years
old. Most of the participants had a diagnosis of breast can-
cer (77%; Table 1).
Impact of Yoga on Memory Difficulty
The average score on the MDASI memory item in the entire
cohort was 3.03 at study baseline, indicating a mild level of
difficulty in the overall population: 14% had no difficulty
(score of 0), 51% had mild difficulty (score of 1-3), 22%
had moderate difficulty (score of 4-6), and 13% had severe
difficulty (score of 7-10; Table 2). Postintervention, those in
the YOCAS©® group had a raw score decrease in memory
difficulty of 0.60 units, whereas controls had a raw score
decrease of 0.16 units (Table 3 and Figure 2). This repre-
sents a 19.2% improvement in the YOCAS©® group com-
pared with a 5.4% improvement in controls; this
postintervention group difference was statistically signifi-
cant per the GLM model, controlling for relevant covari-
ates, including age, race, gender, ethnicity, education,
baseline memory, and baseline sleep score (PSQI) (P < .05).
Additionally, the only covariate that was significantly and
independently associated with postintervention memory
score was baseline memory score. We also explored whether
previous surgery, previous chemotherapy, previous radia-
tion therapy, previous hormone therapy, and current hor-
mone therapy were significant covariates in the GLM
models. None of these was significant; however, previous
chemotherapy showed a trend toward significance (P =
.06), with chemotherapy exposure associated with increased
reported memory difficulty. Overall, the Cohen's D effect
size of the impact of yoga over control was -0.24, indicat-
ing significantly more improvement in the YOCAS©®
group compared with controls (P < .05).
Moderation and Mediation Pathways: Testing
Memory as the Moderator and Mediator on
Sleep
We decided to keep age as a covariate in the moderation and
mediation pathway analyses because age is well known for
association with cognitive difficulties, including memory
difficulty, and the age range of participants in our study
spanned 47 years. We did not find a significant moderating
effect of baseline memory on postintervention PSQI (P >
.05). For mediation, we assessed changes in memory medi-
ating changes in sleep. In this model, the direct effect of the
intervention on sleep (using the PSQI total change score)
was -0.762 (P < .05; Figure 3), meaning that theYOCAS©®
intervention improved sleep quality by 0.762 points com-
pared with the SC control group. The direct effect of the
intervention on memory was -0.455 points (P < .05), mean-
ing that the intervention reduced memory difficulty by 0.45
points. The path estimate for the mediating effects of
YOCAS©® on sleep via memory was -0.135points (P =
.06); however, this was not significant.
Moderation and Mediation Pathways: Testing
Sleep as the Moderator and Mediator on
Memory
We found a significant moderating effect of baseline sleep
on postintervention memory difficulty (P < .05). For media-
tion, we assessed changes in sleep mediating changes in
memory. In this model, the direct effect of the intervention
Janelsins et al 267
on memory (using the memory difficulty change score) was
-0.361 (P = .078; Figure 4), meaning that the YOCAS©®
intervention improved memory by 0.361 points compared
with the SC control group. The direct effect of the interven-
tion on sleep was -0.894 points (P < .05), meaning that the
intervention improved sleep by 0.894 points. The path esti-
mate for the mediating effects of YOCAS©® on memory
via sleep was -0.096 points (P = .039), suggesting that 26%
of the improvement in memory was mediated through
improving sleep.
Discussion
This is the first study from a large RCT to show that
YOCAS©® yoga--an intervention previously shown to
improve global sleep quality--also significantly reduced
perceived memory difficulty in cancer survivors. Whereas
85% of survivors reported some degree of memory diffi-
culty, the most common rating was mild (51%), which is
consistent with descriptions of complaints in survivors as
often subtle. Baseline memory scores were significant inde-
pendent predictors of postintervention memory difficulty.
No other predictors that we assessed were significant; how-
ever, previous chemotherapy exposure showed a trend that is
consistent with this type of treatment, as often reported as
the most strongly associated with cognitive complaints.
When we assessed moderation of memory on sleep, we did
not find a significant relationship; however, baseline sleep
did moderate the effects of reduced memory difficulty pos-
tintervention. Additionally, memory mediation did not sig-
nificantly play a role in improving sleep; however, mediation
by sleep did play a significant role in improving memory.

Overall, these results support the hypothesis that yoga has
a positive effect on memory function in cancer survivors and
reduces memory difficulty. Limited research has been con-
ducted in this area. Sprod et al40 demonstrated that older

cancer survivors who reported exercise during treatment had
improved perceived memory function during and after treat-
ment compared with survivors who did not exercise. One
recent, noncontrolled feasibility study showed a positive
effect of Tai Chi Chuan on multiple domains of cognitive
function in cancer survivors, including memory, concentra-
tion, and attention.41 No large randomized controlled clinical
trials assessing physical activity interventions for CRCI have
been conducted, making the results of the current study novel.
The current study has a number of strengths. First, it con-
sists of a large nationwide sample of cancer survivors, making
the results generalizable to the US population. Moreover,
assessment of the impact of yoga on memory was conducted
using a rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trial design.
Finally, perceived memory function was assessed, making the
results relevant to the patients' experience. Although these
results need to be confirmed in future research, this is the first
large study that suggests that yoga can improve perceived
memory function in cancer survivors.This finding is supported
by animal literature showing that physical activity can increase
neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the brain--a region that is
responsible for memory--and that chemotherapy damages by
reducing neurogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that
various forms of exercise in rodents improve memory, and
most recently, exercise in mice was shown to improve chemo-
therapy-induced spatial memory impairments in animal
models.42
The concept that improved sleep can help improve mem-
ory function is important, particularly if interventions that
target sleep also improve memory and other cognitive func-
tions. Previous studies have shown that improvements in
cognitive function also improve other symptoms. For
example, cognitive training of memory in cancer survivors
also improved depression.43 Another cognitive training
study showed improvements in anxiety and depression fol-
lowing similar cognitive training exercises.44 Our hypothe-
ses need further testing. In an ongoing phase III trial, we are
currently testing mediation hypotheses to further investi-
gate the impact of yoga on sleep and memory difficulties
and other co-occurring symptoms. In that study, we will
investigate mediation and moderation effects of yoga on
global sleep quality as well as sleep duration, sleep latency,
sleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction, medication use,
and subjective sleep quality. Improving memory and sleep
could enhance overall quality of life and could have broad
implications for improving activities of daily living, work-
life balance, and social engagements.10,12,45
Although these results are encouraging, the study is not
without limitations. First, while the results are based on a
large nationwide RCT, the trial was not designed specifi-
cally to assess changes in cognition. Therefore, the assess-
ment of cognition was limited to memory impairment and
used a single-item self-report measure from the MDASI. A
more sophisticated cognitive battery, with both objective
and subjective assessments, is needed in future studies to
determine if the impact of yoga is restricted to memory
improvements or whether other domains of cognition may
also be improved. Objective assessments of memory will
also help support our findings. In the current analysis, we
did not have data on the time since the last treatment, which
is an important covariate to consider in future studies.
Additionally, future studies need to incorporate more
detailed treatment agent, dosage, frequency, and duration
information to tease apart the impact of therapy on cogni-
tive function and whether or not interventions for memory
difficulty may work better in certain treatment settings. Our
population included primarily breast cancer survivors, and
the impact of yoga on memory, sleep, and other symptoms
needs to be more thoroughly examined in those with other
diagnoses. Finally, the mediation analyses need to be inter-
preted with caution because such analyses should use inter-
mediate time points. In our analysis, we conducted the path
analyses with change scores, and we lack the requisite tem-
poral order of mediation, where the mediator is measured at
a time between the intervention and postintervention assess-
ment. However, overall, our results do indicate that for
patients with sleep problems, yoga improved memory, at
least partially via improved sleep.
The effects of YOCAS©® Yoga compared with SC on
reducing memory difficulty were significant, positive, and
conducted with a rigorous study design. More elaborate
RCTs designed to specifically assess cognitive function
outcomes in cancer survivors are needed to confirm these
results. Moreover, further research is needed to better
understand which components of yoga (ie, physical move-
ments, meditation, and relaxation) are most important for
improving memory function in cancer survivors.
