Many epidemic models approximate social contact behavior by assum-
ing random mixing within mixing groups (e.g., homes, schools and work-
places). The effect of more realistic social network structure on estimates of
epidemic parameters is an open area of exploration. We develop a detailed
statistical model to estimate the social contact network within a high school
using friendship network data and a survey of contact behavior. Our contact
network model includes classroom structure, longer durations of contacts to
friends than nonfriends and more frequent contacts with friends, based on re-
ports in the contact survey. We performed simulation studies to explore which
network structures are relevant to influenza transmission. These studies yield
two key findings. First, we found that the friendship network structure impor-
tant to the transmission process can be adequately represented by a dyad-
independent exponential random graph model (ERGM). This means that
individual-level sampled data is sufficient to characterize the entire friendship
network. Second, we found that contact behavior was adequately represented
by a static rather than dynamic contact network. We then compare a targeted
antiviral prophylaxis intervention strategy and a grade closure intervention
strategy under random mixing and network-based mixing. We find that ran-
dom mixing overestimates the effect of targeted antiviral prophylaxis on the
probability of an epidemic when the probability of transmission in 10 min-
utes of contact is less than 0.004 and underestimates it when this transmission
probability is greater than 0.004. We found the same pattern for the final size
of an epidemic, with a threshold transmission probability of 0.005. We also
find random mixing overestimates the effect of a grade closure intervention
on the probability of an epidemic and final size for all transmission prob-
abilities. Our findings have implications for policy recommendations based
on models assuming random mixing, and can inform further development of
network-based models.

our ability to plan effective interventions. School closure is known to reduce
disease transmission, as demonstrated by Chao, Halloran and Longini (2010),
Rodriguez et al. (2009) and Hens et al. (2009a), but this approach is costly on
both an individual and societal level. Mathematical models show that vaccinating
school-aged children is an effective strategy when vaccine supplies are limited;
see, for example, Loeb et al. (2010) and Basta et al. (2009). When a new strain of
influenza virus or other pathogen has emerged, large-scale agent-based epidemic
simulation models have been used to predict epidemic spread and compare in-
tervention strategies. The methodology underlying these models is described in
Halloran et al. (2008), Germann et al. (2006), Eubank et al. (2004) and Ferguson
et al. (2006). These models simulate human contact behavior, and disease may be
transmitted when an infectious person contacts a susceptible person. In most such
models, social contact behavior is approximated by random mixing within class-
rooms and schools, as well as homes, workplaces and other mixing groups. That
is, people contact other mixing group members with equal probability during each
time step. This process is a simplification of the true underlying social structure.
Simulation studies have shown that network structure can influence epidemic
dynamics. Several papers have demonstrated the varying influence of clustering
and repetition in contacts on disease spread for a range of parameter values.
Among these, Eames (2008), Smieszek, Fiebig and Scholz (2009) and Duerr et al.
(2007) simulate idealized, simplified networks that are not informed by data on
contact behavior. For example, the number of contacts in their models is equal
for all individuals. Miller (2009) explores these network structures using Episims,
a realistic agent-based network simulation model built from transportation, loca-
tion, activity and demographic data, but not directly informed by contact surveys
[Eubank et al. (2004)]. Keeling and Eames (2005) and Read, Eames and Edmunds
(2008) explored the influence of degree distribution on disease spread, where the
degree of a person is the number of contacts he/she makes. The former of these
uses a contact survey of 49 respondents, while the latter performs simulations
based on idealized networks. The development of statistical techniques to infer
detailed and realistically complex network models for face-to-face contacts based
on available survey data is a relatively new area. Recent work with the multicoun-
try European POLYMOD study, a diary-based survey of contact behavior, has in-
ferred within-household contact networks [Potter et al. (2011a)] and age-based
mixing matrices [Mossong et al. (2008), Hens et al. (2009b)], but we do not yet
have a clear picture of the entire contact network, nor a complete understanding of
the relevant network structures for epidemic transmission.
Some papers have focused on characterizing within-school contact behavior in
the context of understanding disease transmission. Glass and Glass (2008) admin-
istered contact surveys in an American elementary, middle and high school, and
characterized contact duration and intensity by grade and location. Conlan et al.
(2011) developed a new method to collect contact network data and analyzed mix-
ing patterns, clustering and other network properties in 11 British primary schools.
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 3
Although these studies provide important information regarding contact behavior
within schools, neither develops a method for inference of the entire within-school
contact network. Cauchemez et al. (2009) analyzed network and symptom sta-
tus data in a fourth grade class during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. They found
that selective mixing by gender influences the disease dynamics, but found no ev-
idence for a playmate network or classroom neighbor effect on the transmission
probability. However, because the sample size was small and asymptomatic and
unobserved cases were not accounted for in the analysis, their findings are not
definitive. Stehlé et al. (2011a) describe a face-toface contact network in a primary
school using proximity sensor data. Salathé et al. (2010) analyze wireless sensor
data to describe the contact network in an American high school and demonstrate
through simulation studies that using network data to inform interventions can
reduce the disease burden. Xia et al. (2010) demonstrate that modeling network
structure within schools in a large-scale simulation model can impact global epi-
demic dynamics.
In this paper we develop a statistical model of a within-school contact network
in order to understand how social network structures within schools influence dis-
ease transmission. In Section 2 we describe our two data sources: friendship net-
work data from a high school and a survey on contact behavior in high schools.
Section 3 describes our methodology to model the contact network and compare
epidemics based on this contact network to those under random mixing. In Sec-
tion 3.1 we outline our method to model the contact network conditional on the
friendship network. In Section 3.2 we describe how we estimate the contact de-
gree distribution from the contact survey, and in Section 3.3 we describe how we
model the contact network conditional on the degree distribution. In Section 3.4
we describe how we simulate contact networks from our model, and we describe
our influenza simulation procedure in Section 3.5. We then compare performance
of different variations of the contact network model in Section 3.6. In Section 3.7
we present our model for the friendship network itself. In Section 3.8 we describe
our procedure to compare epidemics based on our network model to random mix-
ing under three different scenarios: no intervention, a targeted antiviral prophylaxis
intervention, and a grade closure strategy. Results from these comparisons are pre-
sented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5.
2. Data. We use two data sources to inform our contact network model. The
first is friendship network data from the Add Health study, a survey of health, de-
mographic and relational data administered in 80 American high schools spanning
grades 7­12, or high school plus feeder school combinations for high schools not
spanning those grades [Harris (2009)]. The second was A Survey on Epidemics
in High Schools, administered in two Virginia high schools by the Network Dy-
namics and Simulation Science Laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University during the spring of 2009 [Xia et al. (2010)]. The goal of the Add
Health study was to survey all students in each school [Harris et al. (2009)]. Prior

similar distributions of number of close friends.
to the survey, each school created a school roster listing all students with identifi-
cation numbers. Students were given a copy of the roster and identified their five
best male friends and five best female friends. Students could nominate friends not
on the roster, and could nominate fewer than five friends of each sex. In this paper,
we analyze one school configuration with 1,314 students. We selected this school
because it is fairly large and has less missing data than other schools. We model
contact behavior among the 1,074 students who responded to the survey, were on
the school roster on the survey date, and have nonmissing grade values. We as-
sume that two students are friends if a reciprocated or unreciprocated nomination
occurred. By defining friendship in this way, the friend degree distribution in this
data set is similar to that found in the contact survey. The two degree distributions
are compared in Figure 1.
Our contact data source, A Survey on Epidemics in High Schools, was adminis-
tered in two Virginia high schools. In one, classes were randomly sampled and the
survey given to all consenting students in the sampled classes, resulting in a sample
of 116 of 1,116 students. In the other, the goal was to survey all 425 students, but
only 246 students returned the survey because interviewers did not explicitly state
that students were supposed to return the form. We'll refer to this from here on
as the "epidemic survey." The survey defines a "contact" to mean "being in close
proximity for more than roughly five minutes." Respondents reported the average
number of contacts they make during class breaks and the lunch break, the number
of close friends they have in their school, and whether students sitting near them
in class are mostly close friends, classmates but not close friends or a mix of the
two. They also estimated the percentage of contacts they made to friends.
Figure 2 shows the relationship between friendship network, contact network
and transmission network. The top panel depicts a subset of the Add Health friend-
ship network. The middle panel shows a simulated contact network among this
same set of students for one day. Here, an edge between two nodes means they
made one or more contacts, and the shade of the edge represents the total dura-
tion of contact throughout the day for that pair. The contact network is denser than

each pair. The bottom figure shows a simulated transmission network based on this contact network.
The seed of the epidemic is black; the color of other nodes indicates whether they became infected
during the epidemic or not. The friendship network was plotted with a standard layout algorithm
which places connected vertices closer and disconnected vertices farther away in order to reduce
numbers of edge crossings and reflect inherent symmetry [Fruchterman and Reingold (1991)]. The
other two plots use the same vertex layout as the friendship network.

the friendship network, as students tend to contact their close friends as well as
many other students during a typical school day. Of key scientific interest is the
transmission network, an example of which is shown in the bottom panel. The
dependency in the networks is shown by the higher numbers of contacts between
friends and higher numbers of transmission events between friends. In this paper
we focus on inference of the contact network and explore how contact network
structure impacts the transmission process.
3. Methodology. Our friendship network data forms the basis for our contact
network model. One approach to model the contact network for these students
would be to let friendships represent contacts, assuming that students contact all
of their close friends, and no other schoolmates, on a given day. Such a model
would be overly simplistic. We believe that students are more likely to contact their
friends and make longer durations of contacts to friends, but also contact other
students in their classes and in the school. We build a complex model capturing
these tendencies. We model contact behavior among the students in the Add Health
friendship network, using the epidemic survey to estimate numbers of contacts
and preference of contacts to friends. Finally, we estimate the friendship network
itself from individual-level attributes so that our model can be used for an arbitrary
school.
3.1. Modeling the contact network conditional on the friendship network. We
first describe our methodology to estimate the contact network conditional on the
empirical friendship network. We chose to model the friendship network itself as a
final step. Comparison of epidemics based on the empirical friendship network to
those based on a friendship network simulated from our model assists with model
validation for the friendship network model. Through this comparison, we assess
whether the friendship network model captures the network structures relevant to
the transmission process.
We can represent the contact network graphically by letting each student be
a node and each contact be an edge between two nodes. The degree of a node
is the number of contacts made by that student during one day. We denote the
contact network by an n by n sociomatrix Y, where n is the number of students in
the school. Yij denotes the number of 10-minute contacts between student i and
student j. Each pair of nodes in the network is referred to as a dyad.
We assume that students have seven classes of 40 minutes each, a 50-minute
lunch break and five 10-minute nonlunch breaks. We define a "contact" to be a
10-minute face-to-face social contact. If two students spend an hour together, that
is considered six "contacts." We allow a maximum of 38 contacts (6 hours and
twenty minutes) between any two students on a given day.
3.2. Modeling the contact degree distribution. We model the degree distribu-
tion of the network using data from the epidemic survey. We assume that students
reported numbers of schoolmates contacted rather than numbers of 10-minute
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 7
chunks of time spent in contact. We model break contacts and lunch contacts with
negative binomial distributions because the observed sample mean and variance
indicate over-dispersion. We used number of friends as a predictor, expecting stu-
dents with higher numbers of friends to make more contacts at school. We fit a gen-
eralized linear model with the glm.nb function in the MASS library in R [Venables
and Ripley (2002), R Development Core Team (2008)]. Before fitting, we modified
some outliers: we recoded 11 reports of break contacts greater than 20 to 20, and
we removed 11 reports of numbers of close friends that were over 40, assuming
that these students defined "close friend" differently than the others. Our model
estimates a mean of 4.5 break contacts for a student with zero friends and an in-
crease in expected number of break contacts by a factor of 1.03 for each additional
friend (95% C.I.: [1.01, 1.04]). Using the same model, we found no association
between lunch contacts and number of close friends; the model estimated an in-
crease in expected number of lunch contacts by a factor of 1.00 for each additional
friend (95% C.I.: [1.00, 1.00]; p = 0.32). Therefore, we estimated the lunch con-
tact distribution with a negative binomial distribution with no predictor. To reduce
the influence of outliers, we used a fitting procedure which assumes that reports
above a specified cutoff contain no other information apart from being above the
cutoff. We chose a cutoff of 30 for average lunch contacts, so reported lunch con-
tacts over 30 were treated as if these students had reported ">30" lunch contacts.
We assumed that lunch contacts could be 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 minutes with equal
probability, so we multiplied each simulated contact by a randomly chosen number
between one and five. The fitting procedure is implemented with the anbmle()
function available in the degreenet package in R [R Development Core Team
(2008), Handcock (2003)].
Classroom contacts were not reported, so we create a model for the within-
classroom contact degree distribution as follows. We assumed students take classes
only with others in the same grade. Each student is randomly assigned to have 2, 3
or 4 class neighbors with probabilities 1/9, 4/9 and 4/9 in each class. We assumed
that students make 40 minutes of continuous contact with each of their neighbors
during each class period, that they have the same class neighbors each day, and
that they only contact class neighbors during class time.
The distribution of total contacts is obtained by summing the classroom, lunch
and break contacts together for each student. This distribution has a mean of 148,
or 25 person-hours of contact per student per day. We validated our fitted degree
distribution by comparing it to contact reports from an alternate data source, the
POLYMOD study [Mossong et al. (2008)]. This validation is described in the sup-
plementary material [Potter et al. (2011b)].
3.3. Modeling the contact network conditional on the degrees. We depict the
degrees as a set of nodes representing students, each of whom has a number of
stubs representing their contacts. In this section we describe how these stubs will
be linked, forming the entire network of contacts between students. We denote the
8 POTTER, HANDCOCK, LONGINI, JR. AND HALLORAN
degrees as a vector D of length n, where Di is the number of contacts student i
makes in one day.
Let Ybl be the sociomatrix of contacts occurring during any of the class breaks or
during lunch and Yc denote the within-class contact sociomatrix, so Y = Ybl
+ Yc.
We model Ybl conditional on the break and lunch contact degrees, and we model Yc
conditional on the class contact degrees. Let Dbl denote the vector of break/lunch
degrees. Then the probability distribution for Ybl can be expressed:
P(Ybl
= ybl) =
dbl
P(Ybl
= ybl
|Dbl
= dbl)P(Dbl
= dbl).
Because respondents in the epidemic survey report an average of 68% of con-
tacts occurring to friends, our model distributes 68% of contacts to friends and
32% to nonfriends, with a maximum of 10 contacts per dyad allowed (since there
are 100 minutes in the 5 breaks plus lunch period combined). Apart from these
constraints, contacts occur randomly conditional on the degree distribution, which
means that all networks satisfying these constraints have equal probability:
P(Ybl
= y|Dbl
= dbl) =

where c(dbl) is a normalizing constant.
We develop a method to simulate networks from a specified degree vector, with
random mixing conditional on degree and permitting multiple edges (up to a speci-
fied maximum) between two nodes. Our method is an extension of the reedmol-
loy() function in the degreenet package in R [R Development Core Team
(2008), Handcock (2003)]. Denote the maximum number of edges m and the tar-
get percentage of edges to friends p, and let di denote the degree of node i. We
first compute the target number of contacts between friends, denoted by T :
T = p
n
i=1
di
2
.
We randomly sample a stub, and let i denote the node possessing this stub. We
consider the set of friends of i which have fewer than m edges to i. We randomly
sample one friend from this set, with probability proportional to the remaining
(unassigned) degree of each friend. Then the two stubs are connected. This pro-
cedure is repeated until we have T contacts between friends. Next, we repeat the
process for nonfriend contacts. The procedure requires the sum of the degrees to be
even and enough friendships so that m times the number of friendships is greater
than or equal to T . Since self-self edges are not permitted, the procedure also re-
quires max(d)  {i : dimax(d)} min{m,di
}.
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 9
To simulate break/lunch contact networks, we first sample lunch and break con-
tacts from the fitted degree distributions for each student. Then we distribute 68%
of contacts to friends, with a maximum of 10 contacts occurring between any pair
of friends.
Next we describe the probability distribution for our class contact network. We
assume that students take classes only with others in the same grade. We model the
matrix of class neighbors, Yneighbors, where Yneighbors,ij is the number of classes in
which i and j are neighbors. We then assume that each pair of class neighbors
makes 40 minutes of continuous contact during each shared class, so the contact
matrix is Yc
= 4Yneighbors.
To model Yneighbors, let Yk denote the n by n matrix showing classroom neigh-
bors within grade k. That is, if i and j are in grade k, then the ijth element of
Yk is the number of classes in which i and j are class neighbors, and if i or j is
not in grade k, then Yk,ij
= 0. Then Yneighbors
= Y7
+ Y8
+ ··· + Y12. We model
degrees of class neighbors within grade k as described previously. Because 74% of
respondents in the epidemic survey reported sitting next to "A mix of friends and
nonfriends" in class, we assume that 50% of class neighbors are friends. Using the
procedure described above, we distribute 50% of class neighbors to be friends and
allow students to be neighbors in more than one class, with a maximum of 7 shared
classes. Thus,
P(Yk
= y|D = d) =

where c(d) is a normalizing constant.
To simulate a class contact network for one day, we first sample class neighbor
degrees for each grade from the fitted degree distributions. Then we use our modi-
fied reedmolloy() function to distribute 50% of neighbors to friends, allowing two
students to be neighbors in a maximum of 7 classes, for each of the grades. We
multiply these class neighbor matrices by four to obtain class contact matrices for
each grade, and sum the seven grade-specific class contact matrices to obtain the
class contact matrix for the entire day.
3.4. Contact network simulation procedure. In this section we describe our
algorithm to simulate contact networks from our model. The uncertainty in esti-
mation of the input parameters to our model will propagate to create uncertainty
in epidemic predictions. We use a nonparametric bootstrap to estimate this uncer-
tainty [Efron and Tibshirani (1993)].
We simulate a contact network as follows:
(1) Resample with replacement from the epidemic survey.
10 POTTER, HANDCOCK, LONGINI, JR. AND HALLORAN
(2) Using the resampled data, estimate degree distribution parameters (as de-
scribed in Section 3.2), and compute the average percentage of contacts to friends.
Denote this percentage by X, where E[X] = 68%.
(3) Simulate break and lunch contact degrees from the fitted distributions.
(4) Link stubs (as described in Section 3.3) so that X% of break and lunch
contacts are between friends.
(5) Simulate class neighbor degrees from the assumed degree distribution, de-
scribed in Section 3.2.
(6) Link stubs (as described in Section 3.3) so that 50% of class neighbors are
friends.
(7) Multiply by 4, assuming that class neighbors make 40 minutes of continu-
ous contact in each shared class.
(8) Sum the break/lunch contact network and class contact network matrices to
obtain the contact network matrix for one day.
To produce a dynamic contact network model, we sample a new break/lunch
contact network each day of the influenza season, but keep the same class con-
tact network throughout the influenza season. In the supplementary material, we
present descriptive analyses of contact networks simulated from our model and
find their properties to be consistent with our observed data [Potter et al. (2011b)].
3.5. Influenza simulation procedure. We simulated influenza outbreaks in
schools using the natural history of influenza as was done by Chao, Halloran and
Longini (2010). We assume that each student has an incubation period (time be-
tween exposure and appearance of symptoms) of 1, 2 or 3 days with probabilities
0.30, 0.50 and 0.20, respectively. Each infected person stays infected for exactly
6 days, after which he/she is moved to the immune category. Transmission can oc-
cur only when contact is made between an infected person and a susceptible per-
son. For each infected person, we sample a curve of viral load over time from those
of six patients in the human challenge study described in Murphy et al. (1980) and
Baccam et al. (2006), and we assume that the infectiousness of each person on
a given day is proportional to their viral load. We assume that 67% of students
become symptomatic during their infectious period, and symptomatic people are
twice as infectious as asymptomatic people, so their infectiousness is proportional
to twice their viral load. Let pt,i denote the per-10-minute transmission proba-
bility of person i on day t. The events that i transmits to j during two different
10-minute contacts are dependent, since transmission during the earlier contact
precludes transmission during the latter. Thus, if j is susceptible,
P(j escapes infection by person i on day t) = (1 - pt,i)Yij ,
so
P(j infected on day t) = 1 -
n
i=1
(1 - pt,i)Yij .
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 11
We assume 75% of sick students withdraw to the home: 20.3% on the first day
they have symptoms, 39.7% on the second, and 15% on the third [Chao, Halloran
and Longini (2010), Elveback et al. (1976)].
We used mean per-10-minute transmission probabilities ranging from 0.001 to
0.007. We track the epidemic until no infected people remain. We estimated the
probability of epidemic (defined as more than 200 students becoming infected),
the peak date of the disease season and the final epidemic size. In performing sim-
ulations for model comparison (described in the following section), we simulated
500 outbreaks for each model; this number was sufficient to distinguish between
them. In performing simulations validating the friendship network model fit, we
simulated 2,000 outbreaks, which was sufficient to validate model fit. For simula-
tions using our final model and random mixing, with and without interventions, we
simulated 10,000 outbreaks for each scenario to minimize uncertainty in epidemic
outcome estimates.
3.6. Model comparison. We compared three different versions of the contact
network model. In the dynamic contact network model, students keep the same
class contacts for the duration of the influenza season, but we sample a new
break/lunch contact network each day. There is, to our knowledge, no previous
work on modeling dynamic within-school contact networks, and we consider this
to be our most realistic model. To assess whether these dynamics influenced epi-
demic predictions, we compared this to a static contact network model, in which
students contact the same people each day for the duration of the influenza sea-
son. The static network approach is commonly used to model influenza epidemics
[Miller (2009)]. Finally, we investigated whether the transmission process is driven
purely by the friendship structure by implementing a friendship-only model, in
which students only contact their friends. We calibrated the friendship-only model
so that the expected total number of contacts in all models is the same. Compar-
ison to this model will reveal whether the additional network structure we added,
including a proportion of contacts to nonfriends, variation in contact degree and
classroom structure, has an impact on epidemic predictions.
We simulated 500 epidemics over each of these three models using the natural
history of influenza described above. Epidemic outcomes, displayed in Figure 3,
are essentially identical in the static and dynamic contact network models. A sim-
ilar result was found in a different setting by Stehlé et al. (2011b). This is because
our dynamic model creates a sequence of highly correlated contact networks. Al-
though break/lunch contact networks are sampled independently from one day to
the next, these networks are dependent because they rely on the same underly-
ing friendship network, which stays the same for the whole influenza season. We
found that most contacts which change status from on to off or vice versa are
only 10 minutes in duration. These dynamics do little, if anything, to shift the
course of the epidemic. The friendship-only model behaves quite differently. The
friendship-only model is oversimplified, and the additional network structure of

500 simulated epidemics for each contact network model.
classroom contacts and distribution of nonfriend contacts creates a more realistic
model. Therefore, we selected the static network model for our final model.
3.7. Modeling the friendship network. Our contact network model described
above is conditional on the empirical friendship network. To generalize our model,
we need to model the friendship network itself; we do so using an exponential
family random graph model (ERGM). We represent the friendship network by a
sociomatrix Y. An ERGM models the sociomatrix for a network of fixed size as
follows:
P(Y = y|) =
e k
i=1
T g(y)
(Y)
.
Here, Y denotes the space of all possible networks of this size, and (Y) is a nor-
malizing constant which ensures that the probability distribution sums to 1.  is a
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 13
vector of parameters, and g(y) is a vector of network statistics, such as the num-
ber of edges between actors of the same race, the number of triangles or others.
These statistics capture social principles such as the tendency to befriend others
with like attributes or transitivity. A dyad-independent ERGM is a model in which
the probability of observing an edge on one dyad is independent of the probability
of observing an edge on other dyads (although it may depend on individual-level
and dyadic attributes). The parameter estimates are obtained by their maximum
likelihood estimates (MLE). In many cases there is no analytic form for the nor-
malizing constant (Y), which is difficult to approximate because of the large
number of possible networks for an undirected network. Instead the MLE is ap-
proximated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure described by Geyer
and Thompson (1992). However, a dyad-independent ERGM may be estimated
with logistic regression rather than the MCMC procedure.
3.7.1. Model selection. Our model is based on the work of Goodreau, Kitts
and Morris (2009), who use exponential random graph models to describe friend-
ship patterns in all 80 schools in the Add Health data set. The authors model the
network of mutual friendship nominations for each school. Their model includes
sociality terms for each grade, race and gender, selective mixing by race, grade and
gender, and a transitivity term which captures the tendency of friends of friends to
also be friends, conditional on other terms in the model. Our ERGM includes these
effects minus the transitivity term, so is slightly simpler, although we also included
a school mixing effect.
Table 1 shows coefficient estimates for our model. The sociality terms capture
whether 8th graders form larger numbers of friendships, on average, than seventh
graders (the reference category for grade), etc. These terms are interpreted as fol-
lows: a friendship is exp(0.54) = 1.71 times more likely to occur from a randomly
chosen person to an eighth grader than to a seventh grader, assuming that the eighth
grader and seventh grader are identical on other attributes included in the model.
Other sociality terms are interpreted similarly. We see, for example, that eighth
graders are significantly more social than seventh graders, but twelfth graders are
not. Mixing coefficients represent the tendency to form friendships with others
who have the same attributes as oneself; these are interpreted as follows: a friend-
ship between two seventh graders is exp(2.3) = 9.9 times more likely to occur
than a friendship between two students in different grades, all other attributes be-
ing equal. The coefficient is - for the race missing category because there are
no friendships among this very small (n = 11) group of students.
We assessed whether our model captures the relevant network structures by sim-
ulating friendship networks from our estimated model parameters, simulating con-
tact networks based on the simulated friendship data (as described in Sections
3.1­3.3), and then simulating 2,000 influenza epidemics over these contact net-
works (as described in Section 3.5). If our friendship model is adequate, epidemic
outcomes from these simulations should resemble those estimated in simulations

3.8. Methodology to compare contact network model to random mixing. We
simulated influenza epidemics over the static contact network model and compared
them to simulations over a random mixing scenario. We calibrated the random
mixing model so that the expected number of people contacted per student per day
is the same as in the friendship-based model (36), and the duration of contact is
equal to the average duration of contacts in the friendship-based model (41 min-
utes).
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 15
We first simulated epidemics with no intervention. Then we simulated a reac-
tive grade closure intervention, in which the entire grade of a student manifesting
influenza symptoms is closed one day after detection of symptoms. Next, we in-
vestigated the impact of network structure on the estimated effect of a targeted
antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) strategy. Under this strategy, all symptomatic people
are given five days of antiviral treatment, and their contacts are given ten days
of antiviral prophylaxis, starting the day after symptoms appear. Based on esti-
mates by Halloran et al. (2007), we assume an antiviral efficacy against suscepti-
bility (AVES) of 63%, antiviral efficacy against infectiousness (AVEI ) of 15%, and
antiviral efficacy against pathogenicity (AVEP ) of 56%. Thus, the probability of
getting infected during one contact is reduced by a factor of 1 - AVES
= 0.37 if
the susceptible person is receiving prophylaxis, and further reduced by a factor of
1 - AVEI
= 0.85 if the infectious person is receiving antiviral treatment. Treated
people are 1 - AVEP
= 0.44 times less likely to become symptomatic than un-
treated people.
4. Results. Figure 4 compares epidemic outcomes for simulations based on
the empirical friendship network to those based on the simulated friendship net-
work. The results are nearly identical, indicating that our estimated friendship net-
work model captures the network structures relevant for disease transmission. We
display epidemic outcomes for transmission probabilities in range displaying a
broad spectrum of epidemic possibilities: 0.001 to 0.007. Transmission probabil-
ities smaller than 0.002 were too small to produce epidemics, so the probability
of epidemic is zero for that range, while estimated final size and peak date are
negligible compared to estimates for larger transmission probabilities. The error
bars in all plots in this section depict uncertainty arising both from estimation of
parameter inputs to our model, as well as from the simulations. In most cases, the
width of the error bar is smaller than the plotting symbol.
Figure 5 compares epidemic outcomes for simulations over the static contact
network model to those from simulations performed over a random mixing sce-
nario. The estimated probability of epidemic and final size are smaller in the con-
tact network model than in a random mixing model. The repetition in contacts in
our network model reduces the pool of susceptibles accessible to an infected per-
son, who continues to contact people he/she has already infected. The transitivity
present in friendship patterns further limits the potential for disease spread. Friends
are likely to have mutual friends, so the set of susceptible friends of an infected
person is reduced by transmission from other mutual friends. Figure 5 also shows
the estimated peak date of the disease season: the day with the largest number
of infected students. For probabilities of transmission under 0.0035, the epidemic
peaks sooner under the network model; for higher probabilities of transmission, the
epidemic peaks later. The threshold value occurs because the relationship between
peak date and transmission probability is confounded by final size. The plot of
peak date by final size shows that the network model peaks later for all final sizes

work to those based on a friendship network simulated from our friendship network model.
than a random mixing model. The spread of the virus is slowed by the clustering
and repetition in contacts in the network model.
The top row of Figure 6 shows the estimated probability of an epidemic with tar-
geted antiviral prophylaxis intervention under the network model and the random
mixing model and the change in estimated probability of epidemic under both sce-
narios.These plots describe the estimated effectiveness of this intervention for con-
taining the epidemic. Under both scenarios, the probability of epidemic is reduced
to zero for transmission probabilities under 0.0035. If we were using either model
for prediction, the right-hand plot would be the relevant one, and for this range
of transmission probabilities, random mixing estimates a larger improvement than
the network model. For example, when the transmission probability is 0.003, ran-
dom mixing estimates a reduction of 0.30 in probability of epidemic, while the
network model estimates this reduction to be 0.13. At transmission probabilities
above 0.0035, the estimated probability of epidemic is higher under the random
mixing model than the network model. This strategy is more effective under the

network model because the people prioritized for prophylaxis are those who are
repeatedly exposed through daily contact to infectious individuals. In the random
mixing model, the contacts of an infectious person on one day are unrelated to his
contacts on the following day, so the prioritization of antiviral to contacts has no
effect.
The second row of Figure 6 shows a similar pattern with final size, but with a
threshold value of 0.005 instead of 0.004. The third row shows substantial differ-
ences in peak date predictions between the two models. A delay in peak date helps
the public health department develop a response to the epidemic. However, the
epidemic peaks earlier with the intervention under both scenarios. This is because
the relationship between peak date and transmission probability is confounded by
final size; both interventions reduce the final size drastically, so the (much smaller)
peak occurs sooner.

ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 19
In simulating the TAP intervention, we distributed antiviral prophylaxis to all
(100%) contacts of symptomatic students, thus assuming that symptomatic stu-
dents would accurately recall and report 100% of the students they contacted on
their first day of symptom onset. In reality, students may recall only a subset of the
people they contacted on their first symptomatic day. To assess the impact of this
assumption, we repeated the analyses assuming that students reported only 90%
of contacts, and again assuming that they reported only 75% of contacts. These
results are included in the supplementary material [Potter et al. (2011c)]. These
different scenarios only slightly shifted the results, maintaining our qualitative and
quantitative findings.
The first row of Figure 7 shows that under both models the grade closure strat-
egy reduces the probability of epidemic to zero for all transmission probabilities.
Since grade closure is expensive on a societal level, our model could be used to
perform cost-effectiveness strategies, where the cost of grade closure is weighed
against the severity of the influenza strain and its societal impact. The right-hand
plot in the second row of Figure 7 shows that if we were willing to use grade
closure once the reduction in probability of epidemic exceeded a threshold value
(e.g., 0.20), the cutoff transmission probability would be different under the two
models. The third row shows differences in peak date predictions under the grade
closure strategy.
5. Discussion. Our work in this paper yields three broad findings. First, our
realistic, data-driven contact network model produces substantially different esti-
mates of epidemic outcomes and intervention effectiveness than a random mixing
scenario, and the differences vary by transmission probability. Second, we found
evidence that in a high school setting, a static contact model is sufficient to char-
acterize epidemic progress. However, our dynamics in contact behavior occurred
only during class breaks, so relied on the assumptions that within-classroom seat-
ing configurations are constant over time and that interaction occurs only with
one's immediate class neighbors within each class. We recommend collecting dy-
namic contact data and further investigating the hypothesis that dynamic networks
and static networks produce similar epidemic predictions. Once dynamic, within-
class contact reports are obtained, we can integrate this information into our model
and test our hypothesis that a static contact network adequately represents the con-
tact behavior relevant for epidemic predictions. Third, a dyad-independent ERGM
adequately captures the friendship network structure relevant to the disease trans-
mission process. The dyad-independent model is advantageous, as its parameters
can be estimated with logistic regression instead of relying on MCMC. Another
advantage of this model is that the probability of friendship depends only on
individual-level attributes, so survey data on attributes of respondents and their
friends is sufficient to characterize the network.
Our model stands out from other epidemic simulation models for three reasons.
First, we infer the contact network using contact survey reports, while others are
20 POTTER, HANDCOCK, LONGINI, JR. AND HALLORAN
FIG. 7. Estimated effect of reactive grade closure intervention on probability of epidemic, final size
and epidemic peak date under the static contact network model compared to random mixing.
ESTIMATING WITHIN-SCHOOL CONTACT NETWORKS 21
not informed by contact surveys. Second, we quantify uncertainty in predictions
arising from uncertainty in estimates of inputs to our model; this is not standard
in the field. Third, we validated our model by comparing the fitted degree distri-
bution to reports in an alternate data source and by comparing joint and marginal
distributions of variables of contact networks simulated from our model to those
in one of our data sources, the epidemic survey.
Our work has several limitations. First, we have modeled contact and transmis-
sion patterns in a single high school. The friendship patterns in this high school
may be different from those in other high schools, especially schools of different
sizes and racial compositions. We hypothesize that in schools with different friend-
ship structure, our key findings that a dyad-independent ERGM is sufficient and
that a static contact model is adequate will still hold.
Another limitation of our work is that we have treated the Add Health friend-
ship data as complete rather than attempting to model the unobserved friendship
ties. Demographic information is unavailable for nonrespondent students, and dif-
ferences in demographics between respondents and nonrespondents have not been
studied. Gile and Handcock (2006) compared network characteristics of respon-
dents to nonrespondents in a different Add Health school, and found slight differ-
ences, for example, that respondents received more friendship nominations than
nonrespondents. We found this pattern to hold in our school as well: respon-
dents received an average of 4.9 nominations while the mean for nonrespondents
was 3.5. However, if nonrespondents are more likely to nominate other nonrespon-
dents than respondents as best friends, then the true means are closer together. Our
work could be extended by imputing demographics for nonrespondent students
and maximizing the likelihood obtained by summing over all possible values for
the missing edges [Handcock and Gile (2010)]. We consider our partially observed
friendship network to be a realistic representation of a possible friendship network
and believe that correcting for missing edges and attributes would only slightly im-
pact our friendship network estimates and would not substantively impact our epi-
demic outcome estimates. Our main finding that a friendship-based contact model
gives rise to different estimates of epidemic outcomes than a random mixing sce-
nario is likely to hold with the complete friendship network.
Because Add Health respondents were limited to nomination of 5 friends of
each sex, there is truncation bias in the numbers of friends in the friendship net-
work. In this school, 86% of respondents reported fewer than 5 best male friends,
79% reported fewer than 5 best female friends and 95% reported fewer than 10
best friends, so truncation bias is relatively small. Students were instructed to list
their friends in order of closeness, so friendships that were truncated are less close
than the included ones. Moreover, by including nominators of each respondent as
friends even if they were not themselves nominated by the respondent, we may
have reduced the truncation bias. Because this definition of friendship creates a
degree distribution similar to that collected in the epidemic survey, which had no
22 POTTER, HANDCOCK, LONGINI, JR. AND HALLORAN
truncation mechanism (see Figure 1), we expect any bias arising from the trun-
cation in Add Health friendship reports to have minimal, if any, impact on our
results.
Reports in the epidemic survey are subject to a potentially high degree of
measurement error because students were asked to estimate their average con-
tact behavior. We contrast this survey design to the POLYMOD study, in which
respondents were mailed paper diaries and instructed to carry them throughout
a 24-hour period and record characteristics of each contact they made [Mossong
et al. (2008)]. We recommend a within-school POLYMOD type survey in which
the students identify their contacts from a school roster. We could directly model
the contact network from such a data set without inclusion of the friendship net-
work information. We believe that our model is the most realistic possible with
the available data, and the extent of measurement error is impossible to determine
without further studies. Proximity sensor data would also be less prone to mea-
surement error and can be used to characterize networks as in Stehlé et al. (2011a).
Another limitation of our model is that we did not incorporate data on classroom
contacts but rather created a model based on assumptions about within-classroom
contact behavior. A better understanding of classroom contacts could be obtained
by the POLYMOD-type within-school survey described above, in which respon-
dents include the time of day and whether the contact occurs within a class. Further
limitations include our assumptions of perfect observation of symptoms and per-
fect reporting of contact behavior during the targeted antiviral prophylaxis strategy,
but sensitivity analysis demonstrated the latter assumption to have little effect.
We have modeled within-school contacts only. In reality, friends and classmates
also contact each other outside the school. We intend to expand our school model to
include all contacts between students in the school occurring in all locations. The
model we presented here is a natural first step in building the expanded model.
We have developed a detailed, data-driven model of within-school social contact
behavior. We demonstrated that our network model predicts different epidemic
progress and intervention effectiveness than random mixing, and we identified key
network structures influencing the transmission process. We recommend further
exploration into how network structures influence the disease transmission process
with the aim of integrating network structure into epidemic models and simulators.
