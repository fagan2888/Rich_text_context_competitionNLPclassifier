may be influenced by laboratory data, we elected to pres-
ent the MDRD equations for simplicity and clarity. It is not
clear how or if knowledge of different eGFR values may
impact clinical decision making and care plans.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated in a large referred cohort of CKD
patients in a universal health care system with unrestricted
care prior to RRT that OA and SA have a shorter time to
ESRD, faster rates of renal decline and better survival
compared to Caucasians in the same system. Further inves-
tigation into the implications for resource planning, as well
as to determine the significance of environmental or genet-
ic factors, is warranted.

Abstract
Background. While individual socioeconomic factors
have been associated with clinical outcome, a composite
index has not been developed. In this project, we tested
the hypothesis that Social Adaptability Index (SAI) based
on employment, education, income, marital status and sub-
stance abuse is associated with survival in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) patients.

Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients
with CKD stage 2 or greater. We used the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
cohort data between 1988 and 1994 including those
18 years or older. Our primary variable of interest is
SAI. Each component of SAI (employment status, educa-
tion, marital status, and substance abuse) has been graded
on the scale of 0­3, income has been graded on the scale
0­1. Age, sex, race, diabetes, co-morbidity index, body
mass index (BMI), geographic location, haemoglobin, se-
rum creatinine, serum albumin, serum cholesterol and
Hba1c were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.
The outcome of the study is patient's mortality. The time
to death was calculated as time between the first inter-
view by NHANES and death.
Results. We analysed 13 400 subjects with mean age of
50.6 ± 20--53.6% males, 44.4% white, 29.7% African
American and 22.1% Mexican American--with 8.5% hav-
ing diabetes, with an average number of co-morbid condi-
tions of 2.7 ± 1.1. Lower SAI is associated with greater
stage of CKD. Higher SAI was associated with decreased
mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, P < 0.001, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 0.86­0.89]. When SAI quintiles were
analysed, we demonstrated a `dose-dependent' association
between SAI and survival. Subgroup analysis showed that
this association of SAI and survival was present in all
studied subgroups. The limitations of the study include
retrospective design, potential misreporting and misclassi-
fication, and reverse causality.

Introduction
Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1­4 in
the US adult population has been estimated to be from
11.7% to 24.9% (25.8­54 million) based on the results
of recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) analysis and depending on the method of
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculation [1]. There are
an estimated 8 million people in the USA with stage 3
CKD [2]. CKD is associated with increased risk of adverse
clinical outcome, including all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality, hypertension and other co-morbidities [3].
There have been numerous studies documenting the ef-
fect of belonging to specific demographic groups on med-
ical outcomes. In particular, inferior outcomes have been
associated with minority ethnic groups [4,5]. In a recent
study, the prevalence of CKD among African Americans
has been shown to be high [6] (much higher than the white
population [7]), while awareness of it was relatively low
[6]. Similarly, other populations, which are traditionally
considered underprivileged such as women [8], and people
living in rural areas [9] have been associated with inferior
outcomes. It is not clear, however, what specific factors ac-
count for these differences, as the causes may be related to a
biologic effect, or alternatively a social phenomenon based
on differences in access to medical care, health literacy and
compliance. To support the latter, it has been shown by us
and other groups that employment status [10], education
level [11,12], insurance status [11], marital status [13,14],
income [15] and substance abuse [16] are significantly as-
sociated with clinical outcomes. Medicaid beneficiaries are
less likely to receive optimal treatment, and their medical
outcome is worse compared with privately insured patients
for common conditions such as myocardial infarction and
bronchial asthma [17,18]. To separate between biologic
and socioeconomic factors, and identify the population
most at risk for poor medical outcome based on socioeco-
nomic factors, we proposed a new cumulative indicator,
the Social Adaptability Index (SAI). The goal of this proj-
ect was to evaluate the role of this new indicator, SAI, in
predicting the survival of subjects with CKD. In this proj-
ect, we hypothesized that CKD population with underpriv-
ileged status (defined by lower SAI) may have association
with inferior patient survival.
Materials and methods
Study population
We used the data from the NHANES III cohort, which includes >30 000
subjects enrolled in the survey between 1988 and 1994 with mortality
information available through 31 December 2000. Data collection for
the NHANES III was based on a substantial oversampling of young chil-
dren, females, older persons, black persons and Mexican Americans in
order to identify those most at risk for poor nutrition for the purpose of
the NHANES study. Only adults (18 years old or older) with stage 2 CKD
or worse were included in our analysis (no subjects were excluded based
on their dialysis status). Records with missing outcome were deleted. Fol-
low-up was censored at death, loss to follow-up or study completion,
whichever occurred first.
Primary variables of interest
The primary variable of interest is the SAI, calculated as a sum of five
scores related to employment status, education level, marital status, sub-
stance abuse and income. To eliminate the problem of scalability, each
component was graded on a scale of 0­3 (except income was graded
on the scale of 0­1) without additional weighting, so that each individual
component contributed equally (from 0 to 3 points) to the final index. The
grading system we used is as follows:
Employment status: 0 = unemployed, not working due to medical con-
ditions, not working by choice; 1 = retired; 2 = working part time; 3 =
working full time.
Education level: 0 = did not complete high school; 1 = high school
graduate; 2 = college graduate; 3 = post-college education or doctorate
degree.
Marital status: 0 = not married (including never been married and wi-
dowed); 1 = divorced or separated; 2 = married without children; 3 = mar-
ried with children. The married category includes those married with
spouse in household, married with spouse not in household, living as mar-
ried and living with a partner. If a subject was married and the number of
people in the household was >2, we considered that individual married
with children (marital status = 3); otherwise, we considered the individual
married without children (marital status = 2).
Substance abuse: 0 = abusing drugs, alcohol and tobacco; 1 = abusing
two of three substances; 2 = abusing one of three substances; 3 = none.
Alcohol addiction was defined as positive if any of the following criteria
were true: (i) number of days subjects used more than nine drinks over the
last 12 months was >24; (ii) number of days subjects used more than five
drinks over the last 12 months was >48; (iii) number of days subject drank
alcohol in past 12 months was >240. Drug addiction was defined based
on marijuana or cocaine use history available in the dataset. In particular,
drug addiction was defined as positive if the subject used marijuana or
Social adaptability index and mortality 3673
cocaine at least once over the last month. Finally, tobacco addiction was
defined as positive if any of the following factors were true: (i) subjects
described himself/herself as a smoker at the time of interview; (ii) subject
smoked cigarettes immediately prior to interview (within 30 min); (iii)
number of cigarettes/cigars/pipes/chewing tobacco containers used in
the past 5 days was greater than four.
Income: 0 = $20K/year per household, 1 = $20­50K/year per
household; 2 = $50K/year per household. NHANES III did not include
income categories >$50K/year.
Covariates
We used the following covariates in multivariate analysis: age, sex, race,
history of diabetes, co-morbidity index (described below), body mass in-
dex, geographic location (urban/rural), haemoglobin, serum creatinine, se-
rum albumin, serum cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin levels. The
stage of CKD was determined based on estimated GFR (eGFR). eGFR
was calculated using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) for-
mula [19]. Stages of CKD were defined using standard criteria of eGFR
(i.e. stage 2: 60­90 ml/min/1.73 m2; stage 3: eGFR 30­59 ml/min/
1.73 m2; stage 4: eGFR 15­29 ml/min/1.73 m2; and stage 5: eGFR
<15 ml/min/1.73 m2).
Race and ethnicity were combined to yield four race­ethnic groups:
Non-Hispanic white, Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American and Other.
Co-morbid conditions were analysed as a co-morbidity coefficient similar
to the Charlson co-morbidity index [20], where each of the co-morbid
conditions available in the dataset contributed one point to the composite
index with additional points given for older age. Geographic location is
defined by NHANES as binary variable, where 1 = central or fringe
counties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population or more, and 2 =
other.
Statistical analysis
We used non-weighted data in this analysis. Continuous variables with
normal distribution were summarized using means and standard devia-
tions. Distributions that were skewed or had severe outliers were summa-
rized using the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles).
Categorical variables were summarized as percent of total. Groups were
compared using t-test or ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square
for the categorical variables. Kaplan­Meier plots and proportional hazard
models were used for the survival analysis. Survival was defined as the
time from the day of the interview to the death or censor.
Since the number of subjects with CKD stage 4 and especially 5 was
low, for survival analysis, we divided the entire patient population into the
group of patients with stage 2 and the combined group of CKD stages 3­5.

ulation, including the distribution of the factors used in
calculation of the SAI, are presented in Table 1. The study
population had a mean SAI of 7.3 ± 2.7. Of the study pop-
ulation, 18% died during the follow-up.
The distribution of the SAI in CKD stages
The distribution of SAI in different stages of CKD is pre-
sented in Figure 1. Interestingly, mean SAI tends to get
lower with greater stage of CKD, in particular, in subjects
with CKD stage 2, 3, 4, and 5 SAI was 7.7 ± 2.7, 6.7 ± 2.6,
5.6 ± 2.2 and 5.5 ± 1.8, respectively (P < 0.001, ANOVA).
Association between individual socioeconomic factors and
survival
In a single proportional hazard model, each of the compo-
nents of SAI had an association with the risk of death.
Higher values of every index comprising the SAI (i.e. ed-
ucation, employment, income, marital status and substance
abuse) measured on the integer scale of 0­3 (scale of 0­1
for income) were associated with reduced risk of death. In
particular, we observed the following associations with re-
duced risk of mortality per unit increase in each of the five
indices: education level [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91, P =

0.003], marital status (HR 0.90, P < 0.001), employment
(HR 0.87, P < 0.001), income (HR 0.84, P < 0.001) and
substance abuse (HR 0.81, P < 0.001). Association of each
of the individual components of SAI with outcome when
analysed in the same multivariate model is suggestive of
the fact that these factors are independent predictors of
mortality. The effect size of employment, income level
and substance abuse association with outcome is higher
than the effect size of education level and marital status.
Association between SAI and co-morbidity
We hypothesized that individuals with higher SAI would
have a lower level of co-morbidity. We modelled the asso-
ciation between the SAI and co-morbidity coefficient us-
ing linear regression with co-morbidity coefficient as an
outcome. The model was adjusted for the same variables
that were included in the Cox models as described above.
SAI had a significant (P < 0.001) negative association with
the co-morbidity coefficient (parameter estimate =
-0.031), supporting our primary hypothesis.
Survival analysis
The association between SAI and mortality was evaluated
in the entire study population as well as in the subgroups
divided by stages of CKD. SAI quintiles were used for
Kaplan­Meier plots (Figure 2) and demonstrated the in-

The data presented in the table was derived from five separate Cox models. Only hazard ratios for the SAI are indicated in the table. Each model was
adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidity index, history of diabetes, body mass index, geographic location (rural vs. urban), hemoglobin level, serum
creatinine level, serum albumin level, serum cholesterol level, and glycated hemoglobin level.

cremental increase in survival associated with the increase
in SAI in the entire study population (Figure 2A), subjects
with stage 2 CKD (Figure 2B) and subjects with CKD
stage 3­5 (Figure 2C).
We first evaluated SAI as a continuous variable in the
Cox model adjusted for age, co-morbidity index, BMI,
race, sex, geographic location (urban vs. rural), haemoglo-
bin, serum creatinine, serum albumin, serum cholesterol,
glycated haemoglobin levels and the stage of CKD. SAI
was significantly associated with the decreased risk of
mortality [HR 0.88, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.86­0.89]. Interestingly, the stage of CKD included
in the same model did not have significant association with
the risk of death. However, if SAI was taken out of the
model, the stage of CKD would become significantly as-
sociated with the risk of death (HR 1.13, P = 0.0012, 95%
CI 1.03­1.24).
In multivariable analyses of SAI quintiles adjusted for
the same covariates (Table 2), there continued to be a
dose­response relationship between higher quintiles of
SAI and lower mortality.
As co-morbidity might be a significant confounding fac-
tor, our models were adjusted for the Charlson co-morbidity
index. In additional analysis, we included in the model a
self-reported indicator of health status as rated by the sub-
jects on the scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). When this in-
dicator of health status was included in the model, the
association of SAI with mortality was unchanged, while
the health status indicator itself was found to have a signif-
icant association with mortality (HR 1.20, P < 0.001, 95%
CI 1.15­1.25).
In addition, we performed a subgroup analysis, where
groups were defined based on the subjects' stage of
CKD, presence of diabetes, sex, race and urban/rural loca-
tion. The association between SAI and survival was found
to be robust and present in every subgroup evaluated in
this project (Table 3).
Discussion
The association of socioeconomic factors with clinical out-
come has been well documented in the literature [21,22],
and underprivileged status has been linked to an inferior
outcome [4,8,9,11]. While that is true, the definition of un-
derprivileged population is usually based on racial affilia-
tion, sex or geographic location. This definition may not
be sensitive or specific, as not all people belonging to

Fig. 3. Conceptual model underlying study hypothesis and observed association. Underprivileged status might represent either (i) an external
phenomenon, independent of individual and representing environment, i.e. being underprivileged due to demographic, geographic or social factors;
or (ii) an intrinsic phenomenon caused by factors endogenous to individual, i.e. lack of motivation/energy, low IQ, limited developmental or intellectual
resources, psychopathology, poor focus. In both of these cases, underprivileged status causes lower level of social adaptability and social support, which
in turn has social and health-care implications leading to poorer outcomes.
Social adaptability index and mortality 3677
these groups can be classified as `underprivileged' or are
at risk for poor medical outcomes. In this project, we de-
fined underprivileged status based on SAI, composed of
five socioeconomic characteristics. The novelty of SAI is
in its integrative nature and strong association with out-
come. Despite the fact that individual socioeconomic fac-
tors have been linked to health outcome, a composite index
has never been successfully developed and validated.
Priebe et al. [23] aimed to develop a simple index of social
status; however, this indicator based on employment, ac-
commodation and living situation demonstrated only a
weak association with health-care outcomes. In contrast,
the index that was proposed and validated by our group
seems to be an accurate, objective and robust measurement
of underprivileged status. It is also practical as it is based
on five factors easily measurable and quantifiable.
All of the individual components of SAI have been dem-
onstrated to have an association with clinical outcome, in-
cluding several reports by our group [11,14,16] and by
other groups. In particular, the role of income in clinical
outcome has been demonstrated; specifically, higher
neighbourhood income has been to shown to increase sur-
vival and likelihood of placement on the renal transplant
list in CKD patients [24]. We have also demonstrated the
negative effect of alcohol addiction on kidney allograft sur-
vival in transplant recipients. There is experimental evi-
dence that alcohol consumption has a direct nephrotoxic
effect [25]; moreover, alcohol-induced hypertension can
indirectly lead to increased risk of CKD [25­28]. Similar-
ly, smoking confers a substantial increase in risk for renal
function deterioration [29] and cardiovascular disease in
CKD population [30,31]. Furthermore, joint exposure of
heavy alcohol consumption and smoking has been shown
to increase the risk of developing CKD by 5-fold [28]. We
did not find an extensive literature on the role of education
and employment status in outcome of patients with CKD.
Our group described the role of these factors in clinical
outcome in the cohort of transplant recipients [11]. Simi-
larly, the data regarding the link of income with clinical
outcome of CKD patients are quite limited. Prevalence
of CKD was associated with financially disadvantaged sta-
tus [32,33]; furthermore, the poor and socially deprived
have higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease [33],
while living in the area of generally low socioeconomic
status has been associated with a greater rate of progres-
sive CKD [34]. Interestingly, in another report by the same
group, no association between education level, income and
progressive CKD was found in the elderly population [35].
Similarly, we did not find much literature on the role of
marital status in CKD patients' outcome. In our previous
study, being married and therefore potentially having a
stronger social support system is associated with positive
outcome in transplant recipients [14].
In this project, we studied the association between in-
dividual socioeconomic factors and survival, as well as
between the composite index of socioeconomic status
(the SAI) and survival. Admittedly, there is a degree of
collinearity between the components of SAI; for example,
education level has been shown to be associated with
higher income [36], and marital status has been shown
to have an association with higher access to material re-
sources [37]. Similar to that in previously developed co-
morbidity indices (e.g. Charlson index [20]), there is a
collinearity between certain components, e.g. diabetes
and cardiac disease, hypertension and cerebrovascular
disease, age and malignancies. Due to paucity of infor-
mation available in the literature, we studied the associa-
tion between individual components of the SAI and
patients' survival, and demonstrated the significant and
independent association with mortality for each of the
five components of the SAI. Interestingly, while the ef-
fect size for each of these factors (graded on the scale
from 0 to 3) was relatively modest (<10% risk reduction),
each point increase in SAI (the range is from 0 to 14)
decreases the risk of death by 12%.
This study did not provide insight into the mechanism of
observed association. However, we initiated this project
based on a predefined hypothesis and conceptual model,
which might provide explanation of the mechanism of
the observed association (Figure 3). In this model, poor so-
cioeconomic state could be either a phenomenon external
to the individual due to factors neither under control of the
individual nor intrinsically associated with him/her. These
may represent the effect of the environment (e.g. demo-
graphic or geographic location, poor income of parents,
poor education opportunities). On the other hand, the level
of social adaptability may be the result of factors internal to
the individual, intrinsically associated with him/her (e.g.
lack of motivation/energy, low IQ, limited developmental
or intellectual resources, psychopathology, poor focus). In
the latter case, the individual might also drift towards social
maladaptation and underprivileged status (Figure 3). While
underlying factors are difficult to quantify and measure,
SAI may be an adequate and easily measurable integrative
indicator of belonging to underprivileged population. In
other words, while SAI may have a causative relationship
with inferior clinical outcome, it cannot be established from
this analysis, and it is probably more practical to think of
SAI as an indicator that signifies belonging to a disadvan-
taged population. In other words, it is not that poor educa-
tion and income, lack of family and employment, and
substance abuse would necessarily cause inferior outcome
(although such link can also be postulated), but rather be a
sign of belonging to disadvantaged group with higher risk
of mortality.
In this project, we validated SAI by survival analysis,
where every additional point in SAI reduced the risk of
death roughly by 12%, and there was a `dose­dependent'
association between greater SAI quintile and longer sur-
vival. These results are not only statistically significant,
but also are clinically highly relevant.
Practical implications and use of SAI, as well as poten-
tial intervention, deserve special mentioning. Using SAI as
a tool in practice may have deep ethical and political im-
plications (e.g. suggestion of equal access to care) not dis-
cussed in this report. Furthermore, here we propose three
potential ways the results may be applied in practice.
(i) SAI is easy to calculate and interpret; it is easily mea-
surable integrative indicator of belonging to underprivi-
leged population and can be used as such for the
purpose of clinical practice (identifying patients at risk)
and research (defining high risk group for intervention).

Our definition of underprivileged population at risk for
poor outcomes should be more sensitive and specific com-
pared to traditional indicators, such as race and gender.
This definition (based on the SAI) can be used by both
practitioners and researchers to identify the group of sub-
jects at risk for inferior outcome and target them for inter-
vention or study. Researchers and practitioners can use
SAI in designing interventions or clinical studies instead
of defining groups based on race, gender or geographic lo-
cation. This may lead to a greater accuracy and efficient
interventions. The authors believe that establishing SAI
as a new classifier represents a very important practical as-
pect of this study.
(ii) SAI may be used as an additional factor in decision
analysis, where risks are weighed against the benefits. This
is a complex issue, and care should be taken not to deepen
existing disparities, where underprivileged population with
lower SAI would be denied care in an effort to limit the
risk of therapy. To the contrary, we think that SAI can be
used as a tool to reduce disparities, so that individuals with
lower SAI can be given more attention.
(iii) Understanding the association of SAI with the out-
come may help to define appropriate specific intervention
(discussed below) in order to reduce the difference in out-
come, which potentially could reduce the degree of health-
care disparities. Furthermore, measuring SAI over time
may be used as a monitoring tool of some of the interven-
tion programmes.
Finally, knowing that lower SAI is associated with in-
ferior clinical outcome, the question becomes, is it possi-
ble to design intervention to change it? Using our
conceptual model (Figure 3), the potential intervention
can be applied either (i) proximal to SAI (addressing fac-
tors causing lower SAI); (ii) to factors comprising SAI (to
see if any of the individual components of SAI can be
modified); or (iii) intervene downstream from SAI, ad-
dressing the consequences of lower SAI, such as poor
health literacy, non-compliance, disinterest in one's medi-
cal care and healthy lifestyle. We briefly discuss these three
potential approaches.
One may consider an intervention to address primary
factors causing (or underlying) disadvantaged status, poor
social adaptability and low SAI. Theoretically, the inter-
vention can be designed to address underlying factors
causing lower SAI. As it is illustrated in Figure 3, factors
leading to lower social adaptability might be intrinsic to
subject (lack of motivation, lower IQ, etc.), as well as re-
lated to the environment (poor neighbourhood, less oppor-
tunity to study and seek employment). Addressing factors
related to the subject's environment is outside the focus of
traditional healthcare and probably has to do more with
general concept of fairness and social justice. Furthermore,
projects addressing these factors under the concept of so-
cial justice might require large resources from the society.
In other words, theoretically, if the socioeconomic status of
the population is a plain field with absolute equality in all
social aspects of societal living, the disparities in healthcare
should cease to exist. Addressing factors that are intrinsic to
the individual is equally, if not more challenging (improv-
ing one's motivation and focus, interest in studying and pro-
ductive life), and clearly beyond the focus of this paper.
Next, the possibility for intervention is addressing the
SAI itself. It is arguable whether individual components
of SAI are modifiable or not. However, even if effective in-
tervention is found (encouraging single individuals to cre-
ate families, providing additional education, discouraging
substance abuse, etc.), it is not clear if such intervention
would necessarily improve the outcome. The association
between SAI and survival has been observed in this project;
the question still remains though, if the association is caus-
ative. In the conceptual model that we propose, the lower
SAI might be either (i) a mediator of inferior outcome, or
(ii) a separate outcome, which, while correctly labelling the
group at risk, does not necessarily cause poor clinical out-
come. In the former case, one can speculate that indeed
improving individual components of SAI (i.e. employment
status, income) might provide better access to healthcare,
better education might cause improved health literacy, and
being married would provide a social support system. In
that case, the intervention indeed might be helpful. Would
it be then advisable to tell patients to get married before
kidney transplant, to go back to college prior to cardiac
surgery and to seek higher income to reduce the number
of potential diabetic complications? It is an interesting is-
sue to speculate. However, we would be somewhat scepti-
cal that such intervention would necessarily change the
outcome if factors intrinsic to the patient and patient's en-
vironment are not addressed. We do feel that inferior clin-
ical outcome is the result of the interplay between patient
environment, social factors, patient characteristics, etc. On
the other hand, if SAI is merely an indicator of disadvan-
taged status (in terms of underlying individual characteris-
tics and the environment), intervening on the components
of SAI will be ineffective. In reality, it might be a combi-
nation of these two cases. Furthermore, it seems to be very
hard to design effective and practical intervention directly
affecting the SAI.
In our opinion, the most practical way to intervene is to
affect the downstream effects of the SAI by using intensified
education or perhaps psychosocial support in patients with
low SAI. In our conceptual model, we postulated that poor
SAI would potentially cause other factors that would be di-
rectly related to clinical outcome, e.g. poor health-care liter-
acy and non-compliance, being withdrawn from care,
paying less attention to symptoms and experiencing objec-
tive barriers to adherence. Studies demonstrate that health
literacy and compliance relate to outcome [38,39,40,41].
Therefore, addressing these issues in our opinion would
be the most practical and effective intervention in the group
of subjects at higher risk (i.e. lower SAI). Along these lines,
we propose that effective intervention might be developed in
the form of education programme, whereby people with
lower SAI would be selected for focused education targeting
health literacy and compliance. Indeed, it has been shown
that patient education prior to beginning of dialysis leads
to lower complication rates [42] and improved survival
[43]. Authors from Taiwan demonstrated that pre-dialysis
education in patients with early CKD may slow the progres-
sion of kidney insufficiency [44].
The limitations of the study should be mentioned. This
is a retrospective project based on existing data from
NHANES. Prospective observational study would provide
Social adaptability index and mortality 3679
stronger evidence. Reverse causality described elsewhere
[45] should be considered as well. That would be the
case where individuals with an increased probability of
dying move towards underprivileged strata of the society
with lower SAI. However, our models were adjusted for
co-morbidity and a large number of other health status
indicators, and still, the results remained consistent with
primary hypothesis and robust. Finally, the NHANES
population is representative of the US population only
to a limited extent, since the data collection strategy
was aimed at higher representation of African Americans
and Hispanics. To address this issue, weighted analysis
may be used, although we decided against that, as the
population of the study with higher representation of tra-
ditionally underprivileged subjects might present a good
opportunity to test our primary hypothesis. Furthermore,
other limitation of NHANES has to do with the fact that
it is a cross-sectional survey, and serum creatinine used to
calculate GFR was collected only at one point in time
[1]. The cross-sectional study has other significant limita-
tions: it does not take into account the variations in SAI
with time. However, even with these limitations, the as-
sociation between SAI and survival was strong and dose-
dependent. Still, prospective analysis with longitudinal
measurements of SAI would be more informative.
In conclusion, we have developed an indicator of social
adaptability that has a strong association with survival in
the CKD population and in various subgroups. This indi-
cator can be used to identify underprivileged populations
exposed to greater risk of poor outcome and target them
for future interventions in a more accurate and specific
way than traditionally defined demographic groups.
