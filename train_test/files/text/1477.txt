Background and objectives: Chronic inflammation may play a role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. CRP gene
polymorphisms are associated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. It is unknown if CRP polymorphisms are
associated with CKD progression or modify the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive therapy in delaying CKD progression.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: We genotyped 642 participants with CKD from the African American Study
of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), selecting five tag polymorphisms: rs2808630, rs1205, rs3093066, rs1417938, and
rs3093058. We compared the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AASK to MAFs
of African Americans from NHANES III. Among AASK participants, we evaluated the association of SNPs with CRP levels
and prospectively with a composite: halving the GFR, ESRD, or death.
Results: The MAF was higher for the rs2808630_G allele (P  0.03) and lower for the rs1205_A allele (P  0.03) in the AASK
compared with NHANES III. Among AASK participants, the rs3093058_T allele predicted higher CRP concentrations (P <
0.0001) but not CKD progression. The rs2808630_GG genotype was associated with higher risk of the composite endpoint
compared with the AA genotype (P  0.002). Participants with the rs2808630_GG genotype on angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACEIs) versus  blockers had increased risk of progression (P  0.03).
Conclusion: CRP SNPs that were associated with higher levels of CRP did not predict CKD progression. The rs2808630_GG
genotype was associated with higher risk of CKD progression, and in patients with this genotype, ACEIs did not slow
progression.

Familial clustering of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
ESRD has been reported in populations throughout the
world for most types of nephropathy (1­6). This genetic
predisposition to ESRD seems to be strongly associated with
race (7,8). Compared with people with no family history of
kidney disease, African Americans with a first-degree relative
with ESRD have a nine-fold increase in the risk of ESRD com-
pared with a three- to five-fold increase in whites (8). Recently,
the candidate gene MYH9 has been identified as associated
with nondiabetic ERSD in African Americans, and this associ-
ation explains some of the disparity in incidence of ESRD
observed between whites and African Americans (7,9). How-
ever, it is possible that additional genetic variants, such as those
related to inflammatory pathways, may also be associated with
ESRD.
Biomarkers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein
(CRP), are increased even in early stages of CKD and have been
linked to the risk of CKD progression (10­15). These observa-
tions have led to studies examining the genetic basis of inflam-
mation and identification of several candidate genes for ESRD
susceptibility (16­19). Recently, several large population-based
studies showed that plasma CRP levels are under genetic in-
fluence (20­25). Some of these polymorphisms have been con-
sistently associated with CRP levels (higher levels associated
with rs3093058_T and lower levels associated with rs1205_A
and rs2808630_G) and the risk of cardiovascular events
(rs3093058_T) in African Americans (23).
CRP gene polymorphisms that affect CRP concentrations
may reflect lifetime exposure to CRP more accurately than
single time point measurements of serum CRP concentrations.
The primary goal of this study was to characterize CRP gene
polymorphisms and evaluate their association with CKD pro-
gression. We hypothesized that polymorphisms associated
with higher levels of CRP would be associated with higher risk

of CKD progression. Additionally, we examined whether these
polymorphisms modify the renoprotective effects of angioten-
sin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), a drug class known
to have anti-inflammatory effects (26­28). We hypothesized
that patients with polymorphisms associated with higher levels
of CRP would benefit most from ACEIs.
Materials and Methods
Study Participants
This study included participants from the African-American Study of
Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial and The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The AASK
design and results have been previously described (9,29). Briefly, par-
ticipants were self-identified African American, 18 to 70 yr, with hy-
pertension defined by diastolic BP 95 mmHg and a GFR between 20
and 65 ml/min per 1.73 m2, measured by I125 iothalamate clearance.
Exclusion criteria included (1) identifiable cause of CKD other than
hypertension; (2) diabetes mellitus (DM); (3) urine protein/creatinine
ratio 2.5; (4) accelerated or malignant hypertension within 6 mo; (5)
secondary hypertension, (6) serious illness; and (7) specific contraindi-
cation to a study drug. The protocol for genetic testing was approved
by the institutional review board at each center, and written informed
consent was obtained. Similarly, an Ethical Review Committee from the
CDC was obtained for the NHANES III genetic information.
The AASK trial followed a 3  2 factorial design. Participants were
randomized to  blockers (BBs; metoprolol 50 to 200 mg/d), calcium
channel blockers (CCBs; amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d), or an ACEI
(ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d) and to two levels of BP: low (mean arterial
pressure [MAP] goal of 92 mmHg) or usual (MAP 102 to 107 mmHg)
(29). Data were collected for the following comorbidities: cancer, liver
disease, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhyth-
mias, and cardiovascular disease. An interim analysis at 3 yr halted the
amlodipine arm because patients with proteinuria (Upr/Cr  0.22)
taking amlodipine had faster GFR decline. DNA samples were avail-
able for 670 AASK participants that entered the trial. Serum CRP
concentrations were measured in the AASK participants by nephelom-
etry using a high-sensitivity assay (Dade Behring BN I). All measure-
ments were done by a central laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic labo-
ratory.
The NHANES are surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control to provide national estimates of the health of the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population. In the second phase of NHANES III
conducted between 1991 and 1994, DNA samples were collected from
7159 consenting participants. We used genetic data from NHANES III
participants that were self-identified African American, had GFR 60
ml/min, did not have DM, and had a UP/Cr ratio 2.5. For the
NHANES III, we defined DM as self-reported physician diagnosis of
DM, use of DM medications, fasting glucose 126 mg/dl, or a random
glucose 200 mg/dl.
CRP Polymorphism Genotyping
Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected
based on variation data for 23 European Americans and 24 African
Americans resequenced by Seattle SNPs (pga.gs.washington.edu)
(21,30) using LDSelect at default settings (r2  0.64): rs1417938, rs1205,
rs2808630, rs3093058, and rs3093066. We also selected rs1800947 given
previous reports of its association with decreased CRP levels. Geno-
typing was performed using TaqMan Assays By Design (Applied Bio-
systems, Foster City, CA) under standard conditions. All markers had
a 95% or higher genotyping efficiency.
Outcomes
The main outcome for the AASK and for this study was a composite
endpoint of (1) GFR event defined as halving of the baseline GFR or a
drop in the GFR  25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, (2) ESRD, or (3) death. GFR
was measured at baseline, at 3 mo, and every 6 mo thereafter. The
follow-up of the trial ranged from 3.5 to 6.5 yr. Additionally, we
compared at baseline the allele frequencies of each SNP in the AASK
participants with those in the African Americans from the NHANES III
with normal kidney function as described previously (21).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were completed using SAS/Genetics 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and STATA 9 (College Station, TX). Each of the CRP SNPs
was assessed to determine whether the observed genotype frequencies
were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Marker-marker linkage disequi-
librium was assessed using r2, calculated for all pairwise SNP compar-
isons in the AASK dataset. We considered significance for a two-sided
  0.05 for all analyses and adjusted  /n 0.05/11  0.0045 after
Bonferroni's correction for the number of genotype comparisons. CRP
was log-transformed, and the distribution was checked for normality.
Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan Meier plots were used to test the
association between SNP and the composite outcome. Variables were
selected a priori for the multivariate analysis. Haplotypes were inferred
from tagSNPs using the expectation-maximization algorithm provided
by SAS/Genetics 9.1, which also provides the probabilities for each
individual's inferred haplotype pair for subsequent regression analy-
ses. Common haplotypes (5% frequency) were determined from the
most likely pair of haplotypes inferred by the expectation-maximiza-
tion algorithm. This study was an ancillary study to AASK, and as such,
the analyses were not performed by the AASK Data Coordinating
Center.
Results
Participant baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. One
hundred fifty-two individuals (24%) reached the composite
endpoint: 109 experienced a GFR event, 80 reached ESRD, and
12 patients died.
CRP Allele and Genotype Frequencies
The observed genotype distribution for the six CRP SNPs
was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allele
frequencies for CRP SNPs in AASK and NHANES III cohorts
are presented in Table 2. Participants in the AASK trial had a
higher minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs2808630 (G allele: 17
versus 14% P  0.03) and a lower MAF for rs1205 (A allele: 18
versus 21%, P  0.03) compared with the African Americans
from the NHANES III with normal kidney function, no DM,
and a UP/Cr ratio 2.5; however, this association did not
remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons
(/n 0.05/6  0.008). AASK participants also had a higher
MAF for rs3093058 (T allele: 19 versus 16%); however, this did
not reach statistical significance (P  0.08). Table 3 shows the
genotype frequencies for each polymorphism for NHANES III
and AASK participants.
CRP Genotypes and CRP Levels
The median CRP levels in the AASK cohort for the AA, AT,
and TT rs3093058 genotypes were 0.40 (interquartile range
[IQR]  0.19, 0.81), 0.69 (IQR: 0.31, 1.13), and 1.14 mg/dl (IQR:
Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 24­33, 2010 CRP Polymorphism in CKD 25
0.45, 1.81), respectively. The rs3093058 genotypes AT and TT
were associated with significantly higher levels of CRP in the
AASK cohort (P  0.001) compared with the AA genotypes
(Table 4). The P value remained significant after Bonferroni's
correction for 11 comparisons. No other tested CRP polymor-
phism was associated with CRP levels.

CRP Genotypes and Clinical Outcomes
Among AASK participants, the rs2808630_GG genotype was
associated with an increased risk of reaching the composite
endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.62; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.62 to 8.23; P  0.002) compared with the AA
genotype (Table 5; Figure 1). The P value remained significant
after Bonferroni's correction for 11 comparisons (adjusted sig-
nificance level /n 0.05/11  0.0045). Potential confounding
variables were determined a priori, including age, gender, co-
morbidities, BP treatment assignment, baseline GFR, protein-
uria, body mass index, smoking, and CRP levels. None of the
other tested polymorphisms were associated with the compos-
ite endpoint. There were no statistically significant differences
in the demographic or clinical characteristics among the differ-
ent rs2808630 genotypes (Table 6). Other independent predic-
tors for the composite endpoint in the model for the SNP
rs2808630 included ACEI use, smoking, baseline proteinuria,
and baseline GFR (Table 7).
CRP Levels and Clinical Outcomes
The median CRP in the AASK participants involved in this
study was 0.50 mg/dl (IQR, 0.22, 0.93). The median CRP levels
were higher in women compared with men (0.60 versus 0.41
mg/dl, P  0.0001), consistent with observations in the general

progression as reflected by the combined endpoint (HR, 0.94;
95% CI, 0.80 to 1.10; P  0.4).
CRP Genotypes and ACEI Use
Pharmacogenomic analysis was performed to evaluate the
effect of ACE inhibition within each rs2808630 genotype. There
was no statistical difference between the three drugs and their
effect on the composite outcome. We restricted our analyses to
individuals with UP/Cr 0.22 based on the findings from the
original trial in which the benefit of ACEI was the strongest in
this group (9,29). Patients randomized to ACEI therapy in the
setting of a baseline UP/Cr 0.22 experienced fewer composite
endpoints than those assigned to CCBs (46 versus 54%; HR, 0.53;
95% CI, 0.31 to 0.91; P  0.02) and not significantly different
than those assigned to BBs (46 versus 51%; HR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.57 to 1.30; P  0.6). For the most common genotype, rs2808630
AA with UP/Cr 0.22 (n  128), ACEI therapy was superior to
CCBs (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.67; P  0.002) and similar to
BBs (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.75 to 2.43; P  0.3; Figure 2A). For all

Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 24­33, 2010 CRP Polymorphism in CKD 29
individuals with the rs2808630_GG genotype (n  15), those
allocated to ACEI therapy had a higher rate of progression than
those allocated to BBs (HR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.00 to 28.3; P  0.04;
Figure 2B). We were unable to divide the rs2808630_GG geno-
type by protein excretion because of the small number of indi-
viduals with UP/Cr 0.22 and the genotype of interest (n  6).
There was statistical evidence to support effect modification by
an interaction between ACEI and rs2808630 genotype and the
composite outcome (P for the interaction  0.007).
Haplotype Analyses, CRP Levels, and Clinical Outcomes
Six common haplotypes were inferred from six CRP tagSNPs
in the AASK participants (Table 8). The rs1800947 SNP was
dropped from the model because of the low MAF (1%). We
tested for an association between CRP levels and CRP haplo-
types, and the results of the haplotype-based analyses mimic
the single SNP analyses. The haplotype tagged by the T allele of
rs3093058 (H2) was associated with higher levels of CRP (P 
0.0001). No CRP haplotype was associated with the composite
endpoint.
Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the role of
CRP polymorphisms in CKD progression. AASK represents an
ideal population to study these associations because CKD pro-
gression occurs four times faster in African Americans (32).
Although our study suggests that some common mechanisms/
genetic susceptibilities to ESRD may share a common pathway,
it is important to acknowledge that distinct renal diseases may
involve other independent factors. Our study is performed in a
cohort of African Americans with hypertensive kidney disease.
Our results showed that CRP SNP rs3093058 was associated
with increased levels of CRP in the CKD population (TT versus
AT and AA genotypes) and is consistent with what has been
shown in the general population (20­24).
Although the frequency of the rs3093058 T allele, which is
associated with increased CRP levels, was marginally higher in
the AASK population than community controls, this was not
statistically significant. More importantly, we found no associ-
ation between this allele and CKD progression. On the other
hand, we showed a strong association between the
rs2808630_GG genotype, which has been associated with lower
levels of CRP (21,22), and both baseline CKD (higher in AASK
than in controls) and CKD progression, as reflected by the
composite endpoint. Additionally, we showed that individuals
with this genotype assigned to ACEI progressed faster than
those assigned to BBs.

The lack of association observed between the T allele of the
rs3093058, which tags a promoter variation rs3093062 (20,21),
and CKD progression could be explained by a lack of statistical
power to detect the small increase in risk of CKD in African
Americans. Alternatively, it is possible that rs3093058 is not a
key pathogenic mediator for CKD in this population. Although
epidemiologic data support the role of inflammation, including
CRP in the pathogenic process (11,13­15), CRP is a surrogate
marker of the inflammatory process (33). CKD patients have a
high burden of comorbidities, and reverse causation may ex-
plain the associations with CRP. However, studies of non-CRP
inflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms could provide a
link between inflammatory genes and pathways with CKD.
The underlying mechanisms regarding the association be-
tween the GG genotype of the rs2808630 and the composite
endpoint in this study remains unclear. Despite adjustment for
multiple comparisons, it is possible that this association repre-
sents a false-positive finding. A potential explanation is that the
GG genotype of the rs2808630 is in linkage disequilibrium with
another functional SNP associated with ESRD not genotyped
directly in our study. Using the Genome Variation Server
(gvs.gs.washington.edu/GVS/), we surveyed a 50-kb region
surrounding rs2808630 for SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium
with the rs2808630 in the West African samples from the Inter-
national HapMap Project (34). No SNP was in high linkage
disequilibrium (defined as r2  0.80), and 12 intergenic SNPs
were in moderate linkage disequilibrium (defined at r2  0.50).
Fine mapping and functional studies will be needed to identify
the causal SNP underlying the association described here.
It is possible that rs2808630 is the causal SNP and affects the
response to reno-protective interventions. Our hypothesis was
that individuals with chronic inflammation will benefit the
most from ACEIs (26­28,35). Albeit small sample size, individ-
uals with the most common genotype AA and UP/Cr ratio
0.22 benefited from ACEIs. Individuals with the less common
genotype, GG (low inflammatory profile), were at an increased
risk for the primary endpoint even when allocated to ACEIs
compared with BBs (9). These findings should be considered
preliminary and need to be confirmed in larger studies.
The main strength of our study is that it was performed in an
randomized controlled trial primarily designed to address CKD
progression, and therefore, outcome ascertainment was opti-
mal. GFR, for example, was performed using the gold standard
iothalamate clearance. Also, the longitudinal nature of the
study allowed us to evaluate the genotype effect in disease
progression among high-risk patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.
Our study is not without limitations. First, our study results
are limited to African Americans with hypertensive CKD and
cannot be extrapolated to other populations or other diseases.
In addition, neither the AASK nor the NHANES III dataset
currently has ancestry informative markers to adjust for admix-
ture. Our main focus is CKD progression within the AASK
cohort, which was a multicenter study across the nation, and
ancestry background should be similar. However, admixture
markers will need to be performed in the AASK cohort for
future comparisons with other populations.
Finally, a limitation of our study is the lack of replication for
the association of CRP polymorphisms and CKD progression in
other independent cohorts. However, our study represents an
independent replication for the association of CRP polymor-
phisms with CRP levels (21,22,24). Independent replication
studies in racially diverse CKD progression cohorts will be
necessary to substantiate the new findings.
In conclusion, CRP SNPs that are associated with higher
levels of CRP were more common in African Americans with
hypertensive CKD than in African Americans without CKD;
however, these SNPs were not associated with CKD progres-
sion. Additionally, we showed an association between the
rs2808630_GG genotype (low inflammatory profile) with both
baseline CKD and the risk of CKD progression and potential
loss of renal benefit from ACEIs. Larger studies in African
Americans are needed to further explore the role of CRP poly-
morphisms in response to ACEI and CKD progression.
