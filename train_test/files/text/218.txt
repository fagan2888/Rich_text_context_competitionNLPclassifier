The Effects Of Obesity,
Smoking, And Drinking
On Medical Problems
And Costs
Obesity outranks both smoking and drinking in its deleterious
effects on health and health costs.
by Roland Sturm
ABSTRACT: This paper compares the effects of obesity, overweight, smoking,
and problem drinking on health care use and health status based on national
survey data. Obesity has roughly the same association with chronic health
conditions as does twenty years' aging; this greatly exceeds the associations of
smoking or problem drinking. Utilization effects mirrors the health effects.
Obesity is associated with a 36 percent increase in inpatient and outpatient
spending and a 77 percent increase in medications, compared with a 21
percent increase in inpatient and outpatient spending and a 28 percent in-
crease in medications for current smokers and smaller effects for problem
drinkers. Nevertheless, the latter two groups have received more consistent
attention in recent decades in clinical practice and public health policy.
Many behavioral risk factors, chief among them
smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity, are known causes of
chronic health conditions. Chronic health conditions, like
cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, in turn are primary drivers of
health care spending, disability, and death. This paper compares the
associations of smoking, problem drinking, and obesity with health
care use and chronic conditions. All three risk factors are prevalent,
although only obesity has dramatically increased over the past
twenty-five years. There is an extensive literature of the association
of individual risk factors with selected clinical problems. Overall
assessments are rare, however, and no direct comparisons of obesity
and other risk factors have been reported. Obesity research is also a
newcomer in health services and policy research, in contrast to a
long tradition of influential work on tobacco and alcohol, starting

Overweight and obesity refer to increased amounts of body fat,
commonly assessed by the body-mass index (BMI, calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). The stan-
dard categories are underweight (BMI less than 18.5), normal
(18.5­24.9), overweight (25­29.9), and obese (30 or more). Accord-
ing to these criteria, about one in three Americans are overweight
but not obese, and an additional one in five are obese.1 The primary
drawback of the BMI is that it cannot distinguish fat mass from lean
mass and therefore misclassifies some persons. Other methods occa-
sionally used in epidemiologic studies are waist circumference,
waist-to-hip ratio, and skin-fold thickness.
A higher BMI, beginning in the upper range of the normal weight
category, is associated with increased mortality and increased risk
for coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus, hyper-
tension, and certain types of cancer.2 Even modest weight reduc-
tions can have substantial lifetime health benefits.3 In the United
States there was only a minor increase in overweight (including
obesity) rates between 1960 and 1980, but rates have increased dra-
matically since then. Moreover, this recent increase was concen-
trated in the obese category, which between 1991 and 2000 alone
grew 60 percent.4 Other industrialized countries, in particular Brit-
ain and Germany, have experienced similar growth rates in obesity
but started from lower levels.5
The debate continues about whether obesity should be consid-
ered a disease in its own right. Recognition of obesity as a disease or
disability could lead to changes in tax treatment for weight mainte-
nance programs, insurance coverage, and other legal rights. Advo-
cacy groups such as the American Obesity Association strongly sup-
port this goal, which was pioneered successfully by mental health
advocates and played an important role in mental health parity leg-
islation. The disease paradigm also has been promoted, although
less successfully, for alcohol and drug abuse. Others warn that ap-
plying the disease paradigm to obesity could be interpreted as self-
serving advocacy without a sound scientific basis.6
Data And Methods
I Data source. This DataWatch uses data from Healthcare for
Communities (HCC), a national household telephone survey fielded
in 1997­1998 with about 10,000 respondents who previously partici-
pated in the Community Tracking Study.7 The results shown here
are based on adults ages eighteen to sixty-five. The main explana-
tory variables are overweight, smoking, problem drinking, and ag-
ing. The weight indicators are overweight (BMI, 25­29.9) and obese

(BMI, 30 or more); smoking status is classified into ever smoking,
daily smoking, and never smoking; problem drinking was assessed
using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); and
age is measured as a continuous variable.8 Other explanatory vari-
ables include gender, race, household income, and education.
I Obesity prevalence. According to the HCC survey, 36 percent
of the population in 1998 was overweight but not obese, and 23
percent was obese. There is a tendency toward underreporting of
weight and overreporting of height; these numbers are therefore
almost identical to the earlier third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), which measured height and
weight objectively. Both surveys give slightly higher estimates than
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) fielded at
the same time as the HCC survey, which also uses self-reporting.9
I Dependent variables. The main dependent variables are two
measures of health status and two measures of health care use. The
first health measure is a count of seventeen common chronic health
conditions.10 The second evaluates health-related quality of life by
the physical health scale on the SF-12 (PCS12), a shorter version of
the more commonly used SF-36.11
The first measure of service use is spending on inpatient and
ambulatory care, based on the number of reported hospital stays and
ambulatory visits and multiplied by unit costs from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The overall HCC numbers are
very similar to MEPS estimates. For example, average inpatient and
outpatient spending for adults ages 18­64 are $1,494 in HCC and
$1,377 in MEPS.12 The second measure is medication use based on
survey questions about regularly used medication, mapped to insur-
ance claims (for prescription drugs) or wholesale prices (others) to
obtain spending estimates.13 The usual limitations of this approach
apply, especially the underreporting in self-reports and incomplete
assessment of services. Even after scope of coverage is adjusted for,
MEPS estimates are lower than estimates from the National Health
Accounts. Relative effects may be less biased than absolute numbers
are, and I therefore show percentage changes based on the ratio of
predicted costs for the population with and without the risk factor.

smoking or problem drinking (p < .001) and similar (not statistically
different) to twenty years' aging (Exhibit 1). The effects of smoking
or problem drinking are similar to those of being overweight (not
statistically different from each other, although significantly differ-
ent from 0 at p < .05, except past smoking, p = .10). The same overall
picture appears for physical health­related quality of life, although
here the effects of obesity are similar to thirty, not just twenty, years'
aging. Being overweight is again similar to problem drinking and
between current and past smoking, with no statistical differences
between these four risk factors.
I Cost effects. In terms of absolute changes in costs for in-
patient and ambulatory care (which probably understate true abso-
lute effects because of underreporting), obesity is associated with an
average increase of $395 per year, overweight with an increase of
$125, current or ever smoking about $230, problem drinking with
$150, and aging with $225. Only the effects of problem drinking and
being overweight are not statistically significant.
In relative terms, the point estimates suggest that obesity in-
creases health care costs 36 percent and medications costs 77 per-
cent, compared with being in a normal weight range; twenty years'
aging increases service costs 20 percent and medications costs 105
percent; current or past smoking increases service costs 21 percent
and medications costs 28­30 percent (Exhibit 2). Cost effects are
less precisely estimated than are health effects because of the
skewness of utilization. The cost effects of obesity on medication
are significantly larger than the effects of daily smoking or problem
drinking, but most other 95 percent confidence intervals overlap

I Links with specific physical conditions. The statistical asso-
ciations with specific health problems are consistent with known
biomedical relationships and suggest an explanation for the cost
effects. Obesity is significantly associated with an odds ratio larger
than 1 for every condition in Exhibit 3; aging is significantly associ-
ated with every condition except asthma; and daily smoking is sig-
nificantly associated with lung disease and cancer (all at p < .05,
most at p < .01). Obesity and aging have significantly larger effects on
heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes (common conditions
treated with long-term drug regimens) than smoking or problem
drinking has (p < .05). In contrast, smoking has the strongest effects
on cancer and lung disease (in the case of lung disease, the effect is
significantly larger than the effect of obesity at p < .01). Although
cancer and lung disease can be costly, they are relatively rare and
lead to death more quickly than diabetes or hypertension do.
Discussion
Obesity appears to have a stronger association with the occurrence
of chronic medical conditions, reduced health-related quality of life,
and increased health care and medication spending than smoking or
problem drinking has. Only twenty years' aging has similar-size
effects. Moreover, a larger proportion of the population is obese than
are heavy drinkers, as identified by AUDIT (6 percent), or daily
smokers (19 percent), based on this survey. Finally, even though the
effects of overweight are small, they apply to a large population

I Other possible rankings. There are no similar comparisons
across these health risks, but the estimated cost effects of obesity are
consistent with recent studies of HMO patients.14 The absence of a
significant effect from problem drinking may seem surprising, since
many believe that alcohol abuse has a large effect on health care
costs, but it is also consistent with recent evidence.15 Important
outcomes exist outside the scope of this analysis that could provide
a different ranking. Smoking may still account for more premature
deaths, and alcohol abuse is likely to account for farther-reaching
effects (such as drunk-driving accidents).
A causal (rather than descriptive) interpretation of the results
shown here assumes that risk behavior precedes health and spend-
ing impacts. Reverse causality (for example, diabetes or hyperten-
sion causing obesity) could invalidate this interpretation, as could
other factors causing health-risk behavior and high medical spend-
ing that are not captured by race, education, or family income. Sed-
entary lifestyle is an unmeasured variable highly correlated with
obesity, although it can have independent health effects. It is diffi-
cult to disentangle these two factors and may not be particularly
relevant because virtually all interventions targeting obesity simul-
taneously target sedentary lifestyle.

icy perspective are the potential omissions of contextual environ-

mental and social factors that cause both risky behavior and poor
health status in less obvious ways. A prime candidate, the income
inequality hypothesis, posits that economically more egalitarian
communities have better health outcomes than more unequal com-
munities have. This hypothesis has influenced a wide range of
authoritative reports, and its prominent proponents argue that in-
come inequality is a stronger determinant of health than is individ-
ual income.16 However, more recent studies cast doubt on the
strength of the inequality effect. Income inequality across U.S. states
or communities is not associated with the prevalence of any of the
chronic conditions studied here, either, even though the same
chronic conditions are highly correlated with individual income or
education.17
I Weight control as a national priority. Is it likely that making
weight control a higher national priority would lead to weight loss
and improved health? Achieving lasting health behavioral change is
difficult and rarely achieved by exhorting individuals to exercise
more, eat healthier foods, stop smoking, or drink responsibly. Car-
friendly (and bike/pedestrian-hostile) urban developments; desk
jobs; television; and relatively cheap, calorie-dense foods are some of
the recent environmental changes that have changed relative prices
in favor of less physical activity without a corresponding decreased
caloric intake. In contrast, taxation and access control on tobacco
(indoor smoking bans) and alcohol products are environmental in-
terventions (or relative price changes) that have reduced smoking
rates and some alcohol problems.
As with smoking and problem drinking, a time lag
intervenes between obesity and the development of chronic
health problems. The largest declines in smoking rates hap-
pened between 1960 and 1980, whereas the largest increase in obe-
sity has occurred since 1980. The full long-run consequences of in-
creased obesity rates at the aggregate level are probably not yet
visible.
