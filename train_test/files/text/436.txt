The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing:
A propensity score matching approach
Dohoon Lee1
Abstract
A large body of literature has documented a negative correlation between teenage
childbearing and teen mothers' socioeconomic outcomes, yet researchers continue to
disagree as to whether the association represents a true causal effect. This article
extends the extant literature by employing propensity score matching with a sensitivity
analysis using Rosenbaum bounds. The analysis of recent cohort data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health shows that (1) teenage childbearing has
modest but significant negative effects on early socioeconomic outcomes and (2)
unobserved covariates would have to be more powerful than known covariates to
nullify the propensity score matching estimates. The author concludes by suggesting
that more research should be done to address unobserved heterogeneity and the long-
term effects of teenage childbearing for this young cohort.

Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
698 http://www.demographic-research.org
1. Introduction
The longstanding literature on teen motherhood has documented its detrimental life
cycle consequences. Teen mothers tend to have worse socioeconomic outcomes than
other women who delay childbearing (An, Haveman, and Wolfe 1993; Hofferth and
Hayes 1987). Despite this evidence, it is still unclear whether these negative outcomes
among teen mothers result from the incidence of childbearing per se or from the
socioeconomic disadvantages these women faced before they became teen mothers.
While human capital theory holds that teenage childbearing has a real causal effect on
socioeconomic outcomes because it directly interferes with adolescents' investment in
human capital (Becker 1993), the selection view contends that teenage childbearing is
associated with negative outcomes because it occurs mostly among disadvantaged
female adolescents (Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Indeed, the concern
about selection bias points out that isolating the effect of teen motherhood creates a
considerable methodological challenge (Winship and Mare 1992; Winship and Morgan
1999): If both observed and unobserved preexisting characteristics of teen mothers
account for the relationship between teenage childbearing and its socioeconomic
consequences, assertions of causality become questionable.
A large body of research has addressed the selection bias problem by finding better
comparison groups for women who give birth in their teens (Cherlin 2001; Hoffman
1998; Korenman, Kaestner, and Joyce 2001; Wu and Wolfe 2001). For example,
within-family fixed-effects models compare teen mothers with their sisters who gave
birth after their teenage years to control for unobserved family-level heterogeneity
(Geronimus and Korenman 1992). Quasi-natural experimental approaches approximate
randomization procedures by treating twin births or miscarriages as comparison cases
(Grogger and Bronars 1993; Hotz, McElroy, and Sanders 1997). Finally, instrumental
variables methods utilize variables that capture the exogenous component of teenage
childbearing to mitigate the selection bias problem (Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick
1999). Despite their intuitive appeal, all of these models have their own drawbacks. It is
not uncommon to find that they are grounded on somewhat strong assumptions and/or
unrepresentative samples, with mixed results at best. Thus, evaluating the "true" effects
of teenage childbearing remains an elusive goal.
In this article, I extend the previous literature in three distinct ways. First, I use a
propensity score matching approach to identify the early socioeconomic effects of
teenage childbearing. Following the counterfactual framework (Rosenbaum and Rubin
1983; Rubin 1977), this approach matches teen mothers ("treatment" group) to those
who are not teen mothers but similar in all other preexisting observed characteristics
("control" group), based on a propensity to give birth as teens. Then it compares various
socioeconomic outcomes between these two groups using semi-parametric estimators.
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25
http://www.demographic-research.org 699
Second, this article addresses selection bias due to both observed and unobserved
covariates. Past studies employing the matching approach have focused mainly on
selection bias due to observed covariates (Chevalier and Viitanen 2003; Levine and
Painter 2003). Using the Rosenbaum bounds method (Rosenbaum 2002), I evaluate the
extent to which selection bias on unobserved covariates would nullify propensity score
matching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing.
Third, I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), which covers the latest cohort of adolescents who transition into young
adulthood. This article clearly recognizes that any estimates of the effects of teenage
childbearing should be put in context: the U.S. teen birth rate has steadily declined since
1991, when it was at its peak (Martin et al. 2006);2 the economic returns to education
have increased (Morris and Western 1999); a new welfare policy - Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) - replaced Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);
and the influx of immigrants, especially Hispanics, has continued to grow. Add Health
allows reflection upon these recent changes and its large sample size facilitates
assessing racial/ethnic differences in the socioeconomic consequences of teenage
childbearing. Taken together, the counterfactual approach using the Add Health data is
expected to provide useful insight into estimating the early socioeconomic effects of
teen motherhood.
2. Prior research on the socioeconomic effects of teenage
childbearing
2.1 Causal vs. selection arguments
Human capital theory argues that teenage childbearing may have deleterious
consequences (Becker 1993). According to this theory, the incidence of early
childbearing tends to raise the opportunity costs of accumulation in human capital.
Being a teen mother may hinder human capital investment because it is during
adolescence that one's education is attained. Given the high secondary school dropout
rates of teen mothers, they are less likely to attain a college degree, which is more
valued in labor markets. Teenage motherhood also may keep young women from
participating in the labor force due to the incompatibility between employment and
child rearing. Since teenagers are still at an early developmental stage of life, being a
2 Nonetheless, the teen birth rate in the U.S. has been the highest among the developed countries (Ventura et
al. 2004).
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
700 http://www.demographic-research.org
mother as a teen makes it more difficult to take the appropriate economic, social, and
psychological responsibilities. As a result, teen mothers tend to be more dependent on
welfare and trapped in poverty (Furstenberg 1991).
In opposition to this conventional view, the selection view maintains that teenage
childbearing does not necessarily cause negative consequences for young mothers
(Geronimus 1991). Because the majority of teen mothers come from impoverished
families and neighborhoods, simply postponing childbearing may not be sufficient for
disadvantaged young women to escape poverty. Moreover, faced with poor conditions
and bleak prospects, they may have an incentive for early childbearing as an adaptive
strategy. Such behavior can be regarded as a culturally rational response to poverty
because childbearing could derive socioeconomic support from extended families and
neighborhoods (Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Since the adverse
consequences of teenage childbearing may be an artifact of the preexisting
socioeconomic disadvantages of teen mothers, this view underscores substantive
knowledge about the ways in which teen mothers might systematically differ from other
young women in order to assess the causal effects of teenage childbearing.
2.2 Previous empirical strategies
These two contrasting views invoke the fundamental problem of causal inference about
the effects of teenage childbearing: One cannot observe the outcomes of interest
simultaneously for a teenager when she is a teen mother (a treated subject) and when
she is not (a control subject) (Holland 1986). In an experimental setup, this problem
may be solved by randomization through which the treatment group is identical to the
control group in all characteristics other than the treatment assignment. Any remaining
differences in the outcomes between the two groups, then, are attributable to the causal
effects of the treatment. In most social scientific studies, however, random assignment
is not feasible. Teenage childbearing occurs nonrandomly as it is concentrated among
the disadvantaged subpopulation. This selection bias problem points out that one should
estimate the causal effect of teenage childbearing for young women who experienced it
(average treatment effect for the treated) rather than for young women as a whole
(average treatment effect) (Dehejia and Wahba 2002; Harding 2003). Therefore, it is
crucial to identify a reliable comparison group that does not experience teen
motherhood but is similar to teen mothers in preexisting characteristics. A variety of
innovative approaches have sought to account for both observed and unobserved
differences between teen mothers and other young women (see Hoffman (1998) for a
review). They include within-family fixed-effect models, instrumental variables
methods, and quasi-natural experimental approaches.
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25
http://www.demographic-research.org 701
Within-family fixed-effect models compare sisters whose childbearing was timed
at different ages. Since sisters share the same family and neighborhood characteristics,
comparing sisters is expected to eliminate unmeasured environmental factors.
Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, Geronimus
and Korenman (1992, 1993) show that cross-sectional studies overstate the correlation
between teenage childbearing and its negative outcomes, and the effects of early
motherhood are minimal in most cases. In contrast, Hoffman, Foster, and Furstenberg
(1993a, 1993b) use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and find that
previous estimates exaggerate the negative effects of teenage childbearing, but these
effects remain sizable. These conflicting findings bear several substantive concerns
about the sister comparison. Within-family fixed-effects models are based on somewhat
small samples of sisters that come from relatively large families, such that external
validity is difficult to adjudicate. Moreover, these models are not very powerful in
capturing time-varying individual differences between teen mothers and their sisters. If
teen mothers have a lower level of achievement than their sisters, a failure to control for
this attribute will make the negative effects of teenage childbearing biased upward. On
the other hand, the assumption of shared (i.e., fixed) family background factors is
violated if parents divert resources away from the non-childbearing sister to the sister
who has a birth, biasing the negative effects downward.
Instrumental variables methods are designed to take the endogeneity of teenage
childbearing into account, with attention paid to finding variables that are correlated
with teenage childbearing but otherwise unrelated to its socioeconomic outcomes. For
instance, age at menarche and various measures regarding abortion have been utilized
as instrumental variables. Findings are mixed, with some studies showing no effects of
teenage childbearing (Olsen and Farkas 1989; Ribar 1994) and other studies reporting
negative effects (Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick 1999). Although these instrumental
variables are validated in a statistical sense, the assumption that they have no relation to
young women's outcomes is difficult to test. Furthermore, the instrumental variables
methods are likely to estimate the local average treatment effect (Angrist and Krueger
2001; Imbens and Angrist 1994) - i.e., an estimate for only a subset of female teenagers
who changed their childbearing behavior due to the early initiation of menarche or the
availability of state abortion facilities.
Quasi-natural experimental approaches attempt to identify better comparison
groups for teen mothers, such as teen mothers who had twin births or pregnant
adolescents who had miscarriages. These comparison groups may not differ from teen
mothers in characteristics, because twin births and miscarriages arguably occur
randomly. Twin studies show that teenage childbearing has modest but adverse effects
on women's subsequent outcomes for blacks and to a lesser degree, for whites (Grogger
and Bronars 1993), while miscarriage studies find that most of the negative effects of
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
702 http://www.demographic-research.org
teenage childbearing are short-lived and its effects become positive when teen mothers
reach their mid- and late 20s (Hotz, McElroy, and Sanders 1997, 2005). However, the
findings from both studies need to be cautiously interpreted because twin births and
miscarriages are rare events. Also, teen mothers with twins might benefit from
economies of scale compared with teen mothers with one child, resulting in an
underestimation of the effects of teenage childbearing (Hoffman 1998). Similarly,
miscarriage studies would produce biased estimates to the extent that the occurrence of
miscarriages is underreported, or miscarriages are correlated with unobserved
community-level factors (Fletcher and Wolfe 2009).
3. A counterfactual approach: Propensity score matching with
Rosenbaum bounds
3.1 A propensity score matching framework
In the spirit of the counterfactual analysis with observational data, this study takes a
propensity score matching approach (Morgan and Winship 2007). One could imagine
that two young women are matched on the same preexisting observed characteristics,
one of whom is a teen mother and the other is not. Each unit of observation could be
stratified into subgroups according to a specific value of covariates. However, as more
covariates are needed to ensure the determinants of teenage childbearing, there should
be an increasing number of cells that contain no comparison unit. Rosenbaum and
Rubin (1983) suggest that propensity score matching greatly reduces the high
dimensionality of the observed covariates by constructing a propensity score, the
probability of receiving treatment assignment. If the true propensity score is known, a
pair of the treatment and the matched control groups would, in expectation, be balanced
on both observed and unobserved preexisting characteristics. Since this is improbable in
practice, the predicted probabilities of receiving treatment assignment calculated from a
logit (or probit) model serve as the estimated propensity scores to match the treatment
and control groups based on preexisting observed covariates.
The analysis takes this approach as follows. First, it estimates a logit model to
calculate the predicted probabilities of teen motherhood, which are used as the
propensity scores. In this model, all observed covariates are measured prior to
occurrence of teenage childbearing. Drawing on previous literature, I carefully select
sociodemographic-, individual-, school-, and neighborhood-level determinants of
teenage childbearing status (see section 4, Data and measures).
Second, using the propensity scores, it generates a sample consisting of teen
mothers and their matched cases. Among young women who are not teen mothers, the
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25
matched cases include only those who are close enough to teen mothers in terms of the
propensity scores.3 Among a variety of matching algorithms, I consider single-nearest-
neighbor caliper matching with replacement (Morgan and Harding 2006).4 The caliper
size set in the analysis is .01, which restricts matches to have differences in the
propensity scores within one percentage point.
Third, it examines whether teen mothers and their matched counterparts are
balanced on observed covariates. I test whether the logit model from which the
propensity scores are calculated achieves a significant reduction in absolute bias - the
standardized percentage mean difference in each covariate between the treatment and
control groups.5 If this propensity score estimation model is well specified, there should
be little difference in preexisting observed covariates between these two groups.
Finally, it assesses differences in the socioeconomic outcomes between teen
mothers and their matched counterparts. To minimize reverse causality, all outcome
variables are measured after teen birth. For the purpose of comparison, I also present
standard regression estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing.
In fact, the propensity matching approach would produce similar estimates to those
from regression-based models if these models met all of the prerequisite assumptions
and had well-supported data. However, when these conditions cannot be satisfied, the
propensity score matching method has clear advantages over parametric approaches.
First, it avoids serious mismatches between those who gave birth as teens and those
who were least likely to do so, by matching only similar cases. Standard regression
methods are likely to retain these mismatches, producing unrealistic average treatment
effect. Second, the propensity score matching method is semi-parametric with no
assumption of functional forms for the relationship between the treatment variable and
the outcomes of interest. Standard regression methods should assume a specific
functional form that results in extrapolation and smoothing, which are prone to biases
due to serious mismatches.6 Third, the propensity score matching estimators are known
to be more efficient and free from collinearity because only the estimated propensity
scores are required.

3 One might think that the control group should contain only young women who gave birth after their teenage
years. However, this may cause the simultaneity problem, by which outcomes affect the control group's
childbearing status.
4 Switching the matching algorithms does not alter the findings reported here (the results are available upon
request from the author).

6 On the other hand, the propensity score matching method should make an assumption about the functional
form of the model predicting teenage childbearing status, which standard regression methods do not need to
make. However, as Harding (2003) suggests, this assumption can be verified by assessing whether the
matching procedure achieves covariate balance.
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
704 http://www.demographic-research.org
It should be noted that in the propensity score matching procedure, a certain
portion of teen mothers still may not have their counterfactuals in the matched sample if
their propensity scores are too high to find their matches in the comparison group. This
common support problem implies that if so, one can only estimate the causal effects of
teenage childbearing for the subset of the treated group (Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd
1998). I address this issue by evaluating how well the treated group overlaps with the
control group by way of the propensity score matching procedure. In addition, like
conventional regression analysis, the propensity score matching method assumes no
selection bias on unobserved covariates, which posits that conditional on preexisting
observed covariates, teenage childbearing is independent of the outcome of interest
(Rubin 1977). However, the matching framework used here can evaluate this ignorable
treatment assignment assumption by incorporating a sensitivity analysis that examines
how large the selection bias problem would need to be to completely wipe out
propensity score matching estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing. I demonstrate
below how the sensitivity analysis can be employed in the matching framework.
3.2 A sensitivity analysis: Use of Rosenbaum bounds
The counterfactual analysis of teenage childbearing may be sensitive to "hidden bias"
due to preexisting unobserved characteristics that influence both teenage childbearing
status and its outcomes, even if this approach achieves a balance between teen mothers
and their matched counterparts in terms of preexisting observed characteristics.
Previous studies using propensity score matching do not fully account for this
possibility (Chevalier and Viitanen 2003; Levine and Painter 2003). For example, a
researcher might not know how families decide where to live. If this decision-making
process matters both for the incidence of teenage childbearing and for its outcomes, the
true effects of early motherhood will not be estimated correctly. The sensitivity analysis
developed by Rosenbaum (2002) addresses the strength of such an unobserved variable
to evaluate the causal effects estimated from propensity score matching (see Appendix
A for a formal notation).
Suppose that a confounding unobserved covariate, U, exists that affects the odds of
being assigned to the treatment, T, conditional on observed covariates, X. If U has
nothing to do with T, then the assignment process is regarded as random. But as the
influence of U on T becomes stronger, the confidence interval on the estimated effect of
T becomes wider, and the significance level of the test of the null hypothesis of no
effect of T on the outcome increases (i.e., the p-value goes up). In this scenario, one
gauges the end points on the bounds for the significance level of the test of the null
hypothesis for each assumed level of association between U and T. This enables one to
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25
http://www.demographic-research.org 705
find the case where the effect of U on the outcome is so strong that knowledge about U
would almost perfectly predict the level of the outcome, whether or not a unit of
observation received treatment assignment. In this regard, while not calibrating the
exact size of the true effect of teenage childbearing in the presence of unobserved
heterogeneity, the Rosenbaum bounds method provides a basis for assessing the
selection bias problem by making explicit the extent to which the ignorable treatment
assignment assumption underlying the propensity score matching is vulnerable (DiPrete
and Gangl 2004).
A key feature of this method is to allow a researcher to benchmark the strength of
unobserved confounding variable against that of observed variables, because many of
the determinants of teenage childbearing have been identified in the literature. For
instance, family structure is known to have a powerful effect on early motherhood and
its outcomes (Wu and Martinson 1993). By comparing the magnitude of hidden bias
with that of the known observed covariates, we can examine the strength of selection
bias due to unobserved covariate required to alter the causal inference about the effects
of teenage childbearing.
4. Data and measures
4.1 Data
This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health). Add Health is a nationally representative, multistage, stratified, school-based,
longitudinal study of adolescents in grade 7 to 12 in 1994-1995 (Harris et al. 2009). An
In-school questionnaire was administered to more than 90,000 adolescents who
attended the sampled schools on a particular day during the period of September 1994
to April 1995. Based on the school rosters, a random sample of about 200 students from
each high school and feeder school pair was collected between April and December
1995, yielding the core In-home sample of about 12,000 adolescents. Adding special
over-samples that included racial/ethnic minorities, physically disabled adolescents, and
a genetic sample, the Wave I data produced a total sample size of 20,745 adolescents,
10,480 of whom are female. Their parents also were interviewed in Wave I. In 2001 and
2002, approximately 15,200 Wave I respondents, 8,030 of whom are female, were re-
interviewed in Wave III to investigate the influences that experiences in adolescence
have on young adulthood.7
7 The age range at Wave III is from 18 to 27 with the average age of 22. That the data consist of young adults
implies that despite the strong correlations between early and late socioeconomic behaviors, the results
reported here refer to the early socioeconomic effects of teen motherhood.
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
706 http://www.demographic-research.org
It appears that Add Health may not be representative of all adolescents because it
uses a school-based design and misses high school dropouts in the In-school survey. As
Udry and Chantala (2003) demonstrate, however, annual dropout rates are very low at
the national level; the In-home sample was selected from the school rosters, which were
collected approximately a year before the Wave I In-home interviews, so the only
dropouts missed are those who dropped out of school two years prior to the Wave I In-
home interviews. Indeed, a preliminary analysis (not shown) indicates that
sociodemographic characteristics differ little by age. While missing dropouts remains a
concern, it does not seem to alter the results reported here.
Because of its strong emphasis on social contexts and its broad definition of
health-related behaviors, Add Health provides valuable information well suited for this
study. First, the Wave III sample contains detailed data on fertility, educational
attainment, labor market performance, and public assistance receipt. Second, the Wave
I sample provides a rich set of variables that are measured prior to the incidence of
teenage childbearing.8 It also contains variables that are previously unmeasured but
considered key factors of teenage childbearing and various socioeconomic outcomes.
For example, recent evidence shows that personality traits such as locus of control and
self-esteem play an important role in teenage childbearing and subsequent outcomes
(Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006).
Finally, Add Health allows an up-to-date assessment of the effects of teenage
childbearing. Timeliness is an important issue given significant contextual changes
during the 1990s (Hoffman 1998). The 1990s witnessed growing economic return to
education, changes in welfare policy, and the increase of Hispanics in the U.S.
adolescent population, all of which could have influences on adolescents' fertility
behavior. This study does not address the direct impacts of these social changes on the
association between teenage childbearing and its outcomes, but does discuss the
implications of the recent contextual changes and analyzes race/ethnicity-specific
samples alongside the whole sample.
The analytic sample consists of 6,825 adolescent females who were interviewed at
Waves I and III and who had observations on teenage childbearing status, the dependent
and explanatory variables of interest, and sampling weights. A preliminary analysis
suggests that there is little difference between the analytic sample and the sample before
listwise deletion. To account for the sampling design effects in Add Health, all analyses
adjust standard errors for school-level clustering.
8 There were older teenagers at risk for giving birth prior to Wave I. Since all covariates come from Wave I,
this might cause reverse causality between teenage childbearing and some of the covariates. I reestimated all
models presented here with and without those who became mothers by Wave I. In addition, all of these
models were reanalyzed by limiting the analytic sample to adolescents who did not give birth and were
younger than age 16 at Wave I. The results in both cases (available upon request from the author) do not alter
the findings shown here.

http://www.demographic-research.org 707
4.2 Measures
4.2.1 Dependent variables
Educational Attainment: Two measures of educational attainment come from the Wave
III data: dropping out of high school and attending or graduating from some college (2
year or more). I treat GED recipients as high school graduates. Since there is little
consensus on whether GED recipients are considered high school dropouts or graduates
(Cameron and Heckman 1993; Cao, Stromsdorfer, and Weeks 1996; Upchurch and
McCarthy 1990), I reestimated the analyses to treat GED recipients as high school
dropouts. Also, I used attending or graduating from college (4 year or more) instead of
some college for another robustness check. The results (not shown) are similar to those
presented below.
Labor Market Outcomes: Employment status, work-related activities, full-
time/part-time status, and weekly wages are obtained from the Wave III data. Work-
related activities include on-the-job-training as well as employment status. Weekly
wages below the 3rd percentile in the wage distribution are set equal to the 3rd
percentile, and weekly wages above the 97th percentile are set equal to the 97th
percentile. Log-transformed weekly wages are used for analyses. Since there are
respondents who still were enrolled in post-secondary schools at Wave III, I restrict the
samples to respondents not in schools. I further restrict the samples to respondents who
were employed at Wave III for full-time/part-time status and those who worked full-
time for weekly wages.
Public Assistance Receipt: This variable identifies whether respondents were on
welfare at Wave III and ever on welfare. A respondent is identified as welfare-
dependent if she received AFDC (or TANF), public assistance, welfare payments, or
food stamps.
4.2.2 Explanatory variables
Teenage Childbearing: Teenage childbearing status is constructed from the Add Health
life history calendar and household roster of the Wave III sample. A young woman is
treated as a teen mother if she gave birth prior to age 20, given the prolongation of the
stages of adolescence that has been observed over the last few decades in the United
States (Rindfuss 1991). I do not differentiate teen mothers' marital status at the time of
childbearing, but the results reported here do not change when married teen mothers are
excluded from the analytic sample.
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
708 http://www.demographic-research.org
Demographic and Family Characteristics: Demographic characteristics measured
at Wave I include age, race/ethnicity, and immigrant generation status. Race/ethnicity is
classified as non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.
Immigrant generation status is defined as 1st generation if a respondent is foreign-born
to foreign-born parents, 2nd generation if she is U.S.-born to foreign-born parents, and
3rd or higher generation if she is U.S.-born to U.S.-born parents. Family background
constructed from the Wave I parental survey covers family structure, parental
education, and number of siblings. Family structure is categorized as two-biological
parent families, two-parent step families, single-mother families, single-father families,
and other families (e.g., foster families). Parental education is measured with the
highest level of education either of the parents obtained and categorized as less than
high school, high school, some college, and college or more, with a missing indicator
on parental education.
Individual Characteristics: Parental monitoring, cognitive skills and personality
traits, religiosity, and risk behaviors are constructed from the Wave I sample. Parental
monitoring is measured by the total count of activities monitored by parents, such as
curfews, friendships, TV watching, and food and dress choices. For measures of
cognitive skills, I use the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) and grade
point average (GPA). AHPVT is an abbreviated version of the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test with age-standardized scores for adolescents. I retain the missing cases
on AHPVT by assigning them to the sample mean value and including a missing
indicator in the analysis. For a measure of personality traits, I utilize 9 items from the
Rotter's locus of control scale or from the Rosenberg's self-esteem scale.9 Based on
these items, I construct a composite measure of personality traits with 4-point Likert
scale ( = .67). Religiosity is a composite measure with 4-point Likert scale ( = .86) of
attendance to religious services (from once a week or more to never), the importance of
religion (from very important to not important at all), and the frequency of prayer (from
at least once a day to never). Risk behaviors are measured with the questions of whether
a respondent smoked regularly and how many days per month a respondent drank
alcohol during the past 12 months.
9 Locus of control measures the degree of control individuals feel. According to Rotter (1966), individuals
who believe that outcomes are due to luck have an external locus of control while individuals who believe
that outcomes are due to their own efforts have an internal locus of control. Self-esteem measures perceptions
of self worth (Rosenberg 1965).

School and Neighborhood Characteristics: 10 School facilitates interactions of
adolescents with teachers and peers by way of providing role models and developing
adaptive strategies. I focus on measures of collective socialization (Coleman 1990).
These include 1) the school's structural characteristics, such as the percentage of white
students in school, school type (private/public), and school region; and 2) school
climate, such as school-level expectations of going to college and earning a middle-
class income by age 30. Also, socioeconomic conditions of neighborhood may define
an individual's opportunity structure and the normative climate during adolescence and
subsequently affect their future outcomes (Massey and Denton 1993; Wilson 1987).
Several census tract-level measures are constructed including urbanity, the percent idle,
defined as the percentage of young people who were neither at work nor in school, and
total unemployment rate.
5. Results
5.1. Preliminary results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics by teenage childbearing status. There are 1,266
(18.5%) teen mothers and 5,559 (81.5%) young women who are not in the full sample.
It shows statistically significant mean differences between these two groups in a
number of preexisting observed characteristics. Compared to their counterparts, teen
mothers were more likely to be black or Hispanic, more likely to come from the 3rd+
generation, less likely to reside with two-biological parents, and less likely to have
parents with college diploma(s). Teen mothers also scored lower on cognitive skills and
personality traits and were more likely to smoke and drink alcohol than those who are
not teen mothers. The schools that teen mothers attended had more minorities, were
more likely to be public, had lower levels of group expectations of going to college and
earning a middle-class income, and were more likely to be in the South than the schools
that their counterparts attended. Lastly, teen mothers were more likely than their
counterparts to reside in neighborhoods with higher percentages of the idle and total
unemployment.
10 As mentioned earlier, clustering allows adjusting standard errors for these contextual-level coefficients.
Since this analysis is not interested in modeling the variance between contexts, hierarchical linear modeling is
not necessary.

Logit estimates that predict teenage childbearing status by all covariates also
confirm the overall picture depicted above. Table 2 shows that compared to other young
women, teen mothers tend to come from socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.
Teen mothers are statistically different from their counterparts at the .05 level in terms
of almost all preexisting observed covariates. These differences raise a critical question
about finding a better comparison group for teen mothers to estimate the causal effects
of teenage childbearing. Figure 1 compares teen mothers and their counterparts in the
full sample by the predicted probabilities of teenage childbearing obtained from the
logit model in Table 2. Clearly, there is much discrepancy between the two groups:
serious mismatches exist in the region where a predicted probability to give teen birth is
higher. Recall that standard regression methods should impose strong assumptions to
control for potential biases resulting from those mismatches. Propensity score matching
estimates will show to what degree regression-based estimates could produce bias in
this respect.

5.2. Matching results
I construct a matched sample based on the estimated propensity scores of teenage
childbearing. The matched sample consists of 1,259 teen mothers and 1,259 young
women who are not teen mothers but whose propensity scores are sufficiently close to
those of teen mothers. Figure 2 depicts the degree to which teen mothers and their
matched counterparts overlap with each other. Strikingly, these two groups are well
matched, indicating that there is little difference in the preexisting observed
covariates.11
Figure 2: Predicted probability of teenage childbearing: Matched sample
11 In Appendix B, Table B gives an additional snapshot of the covariate balance check. None of the
preexisting covariates bears statistical differences in means between teen mothers and their matched
counterparts; the matched sample also achieves a significant percentage reduction in absolute bias. Although
three variables - father only family, parents with some college education, and Midwest - show an increase in
absolute bias (-22.3, -7710.3, and -173.4, respectively), these variables do not statistically differ between teen
mothers and those who are not teen mothers before as well as after matching. Using the outcome-specific
matched samples produces almost the same pattern of overlapping and covariate balance between these two
groups (not shown).

Table 3 presents propensity score matching results of the socioeconomic effects of
teenage childbearing. The first and second columns of each panel report the standard
regression and propensity score matching estimates, respectively, for each outcome.
The regression estimates are obtained from logit or OLS models using the full sample,
including teenage childbearing status and all covariates in Table 2 as the explanatory
variables. They are expressed as the simulated predicted probabilities or values
computed by averaging each respondent's value on all covariates except for teenage
childbearing status. The matching estimates are the simple mean probabilities or values
of each outcome in the matched sample. To make these two estimates comparable, the
ratios between the treatment and control groups for each outcome are presented in the
fourth rows of each panel.
As presented in the last rows of each panel, all outcome-specific matched samples
have strong common support, ranging from 99.4% to 99.8%. This indicates that the
propensity score matching method succeeds in locating almost all young women who
are not teen mothers but share similar preexisting observed characteristics with teen
mothers.

With respect to educational attainment, Panel A1 shows that when taking the ratio
of the dropout rates between teen mothers and their matched counterparts, teen mothers
are about two times more likely to be high school dropouts. This propensity score
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 25
http://www.demographic-research.org 717
matching estimate is less than a fourth of the logit estimate (=9.455) but still
statistically significant. Panel A2 shows that teen mothers are about 40% less likely to
attend or graduate from some college than their matched counterparts (1­.606=.394),
which is an estimate that is much smaller than the logit estimate but remains
statistically significant.
For labor market outcomes, the matching estimates also find the statistically
significant negative effects of teenage childbearing, although the magnitudes of its
effects are reduced compared to the logit estimates. Panels B1 through B4 show that
compared to their matched counterparts, teen mothers are about 15% less likely to be
employed, about 12% less likely to participate in work-related activities, and about 10%
less likely to work full-time. The logit estimates for each labor market outcome are
about 25%, 18%, and 10%, respectively. Weekly wages do not differ between teen
mothers and their matched control group, but it should be noted that the analytic sample
consists only of those who worked full-time, implying that this sample includes a select
group of teen mothers.
The matching estimates presented in Panels C1 and C2 suggest that teen mothers
are more likely than their matched counterparts to receive public assistance. While
these estimates are far smaller than the logit estimates, teen mothers are still about 2.6
times and 3.5 times more likely to be currently and ever on welfare, respectively.
Overall, the propensity score matching results show that traditional regression
methods tend to overestimate the negative effects of teen motherhood. Teen mothers'
lower levels of educational and labor market performance and higher likelihood of
receiving public assistance result nontrivially from their preexisting disadvantages; and
yet, there remain significant differences between teen mothers and their matched
counterparts in the key domains of early socioeconomic outcomes. What is worth
mentioning is that teen motherhood has relatively smaller effects on early labor market
outcomes than on educational attainment and public assistance receipt. This result is not
surprising, because the analytic samples for the labor market outcomes include a select
group of teen mothers while excluding other young women enrolled in post-secondary
schools, a group that has better economic potential. The matching results, therefore,
suggest that even faced with the similarly adverse conditions when growing up, young
women who are not teen mothers fare better than teen mothers.12
However, the matching estimates reported here do not take into account selection
bias on unobserved preexisting characteristics, which may produce upwardly biased
estimates. A contribution of this article is to conduct a sensitivity analysis using the
12 I reestimated the propensity score matching model where a young woman is treated as a teen mother if she
gave birth prior to age 18 rather than 20 (see Appendix C). It does not alter the findings reported here, with
the exception that the effects of teenage childbearing on the labor market outcomes become a little weaker.

Rosenbaum bounds method to address the role of unobserved heterogeneity in drawing
a causal inference about teen motherhood and its socioeconomic consequences.
5.3 Results from the sensitivity analysis
Table 4 presents the Rosenbaum bounds for the causal effects of teenage childbearing.
 is the Rosenbaum bounds estimate of the magnitude of selection bias on unobserved
covariate - hidden bias - that would predict teenage childbearing status, expressed as an
odds ratio (OR). p-critical denotes the p-value at which a matching estimate becomes
insignificant corresponding to the given magnitude of hidden bias. To give a
substantive interpretation of the Rosenbaum bounds, I compare the magnitude of hidden
bias () to that of its known equivalents. For example, parental decision-making on
residence may be considered an important unmeasured factor of the relationship
between teen motherhood and subsequent outcomes. One could argue that parental
preference for middle-class neighborhood has a negative effect on daughters' teenage
childbearing and positive effects on their socioeconomic outcomes, because it signifies
levels of parental investment in their children. If a researcher takes such family-level
residential decision-making processes into account, the effects of teenage childbearing
may disappear. Recall that consistent with previous research, the logit estimates from
Table 2 confirm race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental education as among the
strongest predictors of teenage childbearing status (Wu and Martinson 1993; Wu and
Wolfe 2001). Then the question is how large the effect of parental residential preference
should be to nullify the propensity score matching estimates, compared to that of these
known characteristics.

Notes:  is the odds ratio of differential treatment assignment due to an unobserved covariate; p-critical from the Wilcoxon signed
rank tests.
First, Panel A reports that as  approaches 1.9, the effect of teen motherhood on
dropping out of high school becomes statistically insignificant at the .05 level (p-critical
is .057). This means that in order to challenge the significance of the matching estimate,
an unobserved covariate should cause the odds ratio of teen motherhood to differ
between teen mothers and their matched counterparts by a factor of 1.9. A selection bias
with such magnitude is larger than or comparable to the estimated net effect of living in
a step (OR=1.697) or a single mother (OR=1.460) family instead of a two-biological
parent family, or having parents with a high school (OR=1.800) or some college
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
720 http://www.demographic-research.org
(OR=1.616) education instead of a college diploma. To drive the effect of teenage
childbearing on dropping out of high school to statistical insignificance, the effect of
parental residential preference should be stronger than these effects even after
controlling for all preexisting covariates included in Table 2.
With regard to attending or graduating from some college, the Rosenbaum bounds
statistics indicates that  should be at least 2.0 (p-critical is .110) to completely alter the
effect of teenage childbearing. The effect of parental residential preference should be
larger than or comparable to the estimated net effect of being non-Hispanic black
(OR=1.886) or Hispanic (OR=1.986) instead of being non-Hispanic white, living in
another family structure instead of a two-biological parent family (OR=1.915), or
having parents with less than high school diplomas instead of college diplomas
(OR=2.049).
Second, the causal effects of teenage childbearing on labor market outcomes
appear to be somewhat vulnerable to unobserved confounder, compared to educational
attainment. Panel B suggests that to nullify the effects of teen motherhood on
employment status, work-related activities, and full-time/part-time status, the critical
values of  should be 1.4, 1.3, and 1.3 (p-criticals are .133, .125, and .072),
respectively. The effect of teenage childbearing on weekly wages is highly vulnerable
to hidden bias, which is consistent with the matching result shown in Table 3 that finds
no effect. As Diprete and Gangl (2004) have pointed out, however, these results are
worst-case scenarios. Unless family-level residential preference had a powerful effect
on both teen motherhood and the outcomes, the effect of teenage childbearing on some
of the labor market outcomes would remain significant.
Lastly, the Rosenbaum bounds for public assistance receipt (Panel C) imply that 
should be at least 2.8 and 3.9 (p-critical values are .056 and .059), respectively, in order
to wipe out the matching estimates of the effects of teen motherhood on being currently
and ever on welfare. Because these magnitudes are much larger than any of the effects
of race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental education estimated from Table 2, the
effect of an unobserved covariate needs to be very powerful.
In summary, the sensitivity analysis using the Rosenbaum bounds shows that
selection bias due to unobserved covariates would have to be substantial to completely
eliminate the matching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing on most of the
early socioeconomic outcomes considered in this analysis. This result also suggests that
since the magnitude of this sort of bias is interpreted in comparison to that of already
known family background factors, one should not rule out the possibility that
unobserved heterogeneity may underlie the relationship between teen motherhood and
its socioeconomic consequences.

5.4 Racial/ethnic differences
Given recent changes in the U.S. racial/ethnic composition (e.g., the increase of
Hispanics) and the conflicting findings regarding the effects of teenage childbearing by
race/ethnicity, an examination of racial/ethnic differences deserves attention.13 Table 5
reports the propensity score matching estimates among non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. For non-Hispanic whites, the matching estimates show
that teen motherhood has negative effects on educational attainment, employment
status, work-related activities, and public assistance receipt, but not on full-time/part-
time status and weekly wages. The Rosenbaum bounds suggest that the effects of teen
motherhood on public assistance receipt and to a lesser degree, educational attainment
are most robust to unobserved heterogeneity, compared to employment status and work-
related activities. For non-Hispanic blacks, teen motherhood has adverse consequences
on educational attainment, employment status, and public assistance receipt. For
Hispanics, teen motherhood has negative effects on educational attainment and public
assistance receipt. Although its effects on employment status and work-related activities
are not significant, they differ significantly from those for non-Hispanic whites and
blacks.

The results imply that teenage childbearing is detrimental to non-Hispanic whites
and blacks, but less so to Hispanics. Insofar as labor market performance is concerned,
the findings from Hispanic teen mothers seem in favor of the selection view
(Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier 1994). Alternatively, given a large number of
respondents who were enrolled in post-secondary schools at Wave III (about 41% for
non-Hispanic whites, 42% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 38% for Hispanics), the effects
of teenage childbearing on the labor market outcomes might be restored if these
respondents entered the labor market upon graduation. Since the economic returns to
education have increased over the past 30 years (Card 1999; Lemieux 2006), significant
difference in education attainment between teen mothers and their matched counterparts
may be carried over into the labor market across all racial/ethnic groups. New data that
contain older age groups would help determine which interpretation can be
substantiated.
6. Discussion and conclusion
Studies of teenage childbearing and its socioeconomic consequences have been
concerned about possible omitted variables and selection biases that are critical to
estimate the "true" effect of teenage childbearing. The propensity score matching
analysis used in this article is designed to shed new light into this line of research by 1)
finding a better comparison group to teen mothers with less dependence on statistical
assumptions than standard regression approaches and a larger sample size; 2)
employing the Rosenbaum bounds method to assess the significance level of the
matching estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing in the presence of selection
bias on unobserved covariates; and 3) providing the most up-to-date assessment of the
early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing with the Add Health data.
As in most of the previous studies taking alternative approaches, the propensity
score matching results show that socioeconomic disadvantages inherent to teen mothers
account for a nontrivial portion of the effects of teen motherhood, suggesting that the
selection bias problem results in an overestimation of its negative effects. However,
when teen mothers are compared to their matched counterparts who are similar in every
observed preexisting characteristic except for teenage childbearing status, teen
motherhood still has modest but significant negative effects on various early
socioeconomic outcomes. The sensitivity analysis employing the Rosenbaum bounds
method suggests that selection bias on unobserved covariates would have to be large to
alter these propensity score matching estimates. These findings are consistent with
some of the earlier studies using within-family fixed-effects models (Hoffman, Foster,
and Furstenberg 1993a, 1993b; Holmlund 2005), instrumental variables methods
Lee: The early socioeconomic effects of teenage childbearing: A propensity score matching approach
724 http://www.demographic-research.org
(Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick 1999), and quasi-natural experimental approaches
(Grogger and Bronars 1993; Fletcher and Wolfe 2009). This convergence in the
findings points out that identifying a more reliable comparison group to teen mothers
through flexible modeling assumptions and well-supported data should be given a
priority.
Several limitations of this study warrant mention. First, one should recognize that
the propensity score matching analysis combined with the Rosenbaum bounds method
is not a solution to resolve all complex issues regarding unobserved heterogeneity;
rather, it need be understood as an effort to make the causal inference about teenage
childbearing more constructive. Second, given the nature of the data, this study speaks
to the effects of teenage childbearing on young adults. Some studies using miscarriages
as a source of quasi-natural experiment report that teen mothers fare better in their late
20s (Hotz, McElroy, and Sanders 1997, 2005). Whether or not teen motherhood has
long-term consequences, therefore, remains an important topic for future research.
Third, it is likely that structural changes influence the association between teenage
childbearing and subsequent outcomes, but this study is only suggestive of the potential
roles of the growing economic returns to education. Research on adolescent fertility can
benefit from more comprehensive knowledge about teen mothers' life experiences, new
data with older age groups, and cohort data linking teenage childbearing to macro-level
social changes.

Appendix A: The Rosenbaum bounds method
The Rosenbaum bounds method is complementary to the estimation of treatment effects
using data on matched pairs (Rosenbaum 2002). Although Rosenbaum developed the
theory for a more general case, I limit the focus to his treatment of the case of matched
pairs (see Chapter 4 of Rosenbaum (2002) and DiPrete and Gangl (2004) for more
details).

where Z is the variable that designates which of each of the s pairs was treated, and r
measures the outcome for each case in the S pairs. Zsi
equals 1 if a case is treated, and 0
otherwise; c is defined as follows:

Finally, ds
is the rank of |rs1
­ rs2
| with average ranks used for ties. The product of
the c and Z variables causes pairs to be selected where the outcome for the treatment
was greater than the outcome for the control. The ranks of these cases are summed and
compared with the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that the
treatment has no effect.
In the case where the assignment to treatment is not random, the above test statistic
can be bounded. It is assumed that there is an unmeasured variable, U, that affects the
probability of receiving the treatment. If we let i
be the probability that the ith unit
receives the treatment, and X is the vector of observed covariates that determine
treatment and that also determine the outcome variable, then the following treatment
assignment equation applies:
