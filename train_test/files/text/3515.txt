Abstract
Self-management support for people with dementia is important to help them and their family
caregivers to cope with challenges in daily live. Insight into the effects of self-management support
interventions on people with dementia is however lacking, despite existing relevant systematic

PRISMA statement. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, the
Cochrane Library, Embase and PsycINFO. The searches were done in December 2015, and all
relevant references until then were taken into consideration. No conclusions about the effects of
self-management support interventions on people with dementia could be drawn.
Recommendations for future research and practice include that self-management support inter-
ventions and effect measurements should be wider in scope than psychological well-being.

Introduction
Living with dementia presents a huge challenge both to the person with dementia themselves
and to their family caregivers. Dementia leads to severe cognitive problems, changes in
mood and behavior, and changes in the relationship with the partner and members of
their social network (e.g., Milano, Saturnino, & Capasso, 2013; Spalletta et al., 2010).
The care is often a considerable burden on persons directly involved, not just physically
but also emotionally and because it affects their social lives (e.g., Pe~
na-Longobardo and
Oliva-Moreno, 2015; Torrisi et al., 2017).
Self-management is therefore important both for the person with dementia and for their
family caregivers in dealing with dementia and the consequences for their daily lives.
Following the definition of Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, and Hainsworth (2002), we
define self-management as "the individual's ability to manage symptoms, treatment, phys-
ical and psychological consequences and life style changes inherent in living with a chron-
ic condition."
However, self-management is far from being a matter of course for people with dementia.
They may need support with their self-management, for example, from health care profes-
sionals or in the form of eHealth, in the sense of dementia-related information and/or
support with the aid of computers or related technologies. Yet up till now there has not
been an overview of the effectiveness of the available interventions for self-management
support in people with dementia, despite of existing relevant systematic reviews. We have
therefore conducted a meta-review of these existing systematic reviews. However, it became
clear during the analysis for the meta-review that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the
effects of self-management interventions on people with dementia. Nevertheless, the meta-
review gives some interesting insights into the kind of interventions being used and provides
recommendations for future research and practice. This brief research paper presents the
results of the meta-review.
Methods
We conducted a meta-review, in the sense of a systematic literature study of existing relevant
systematic reviews. We followed the PRISMA Statement for systematic reviews (Moher,
Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009) wherever possible, as incorporated in a protocol drawn
2 Dementia 0(0)
up in advance. The reviews had to deal with self-management support in dementia, in which
the effects were measured at the individual patient level. Table 1 summarizes the specific
inclusion criteria.
Search strategy and sources
Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library,
Embase and PsycINFO in December 2015. First, a sensitive search strategy was developed
for PubMed/Medline. This was then adapted for use in the other databases. All publications
up to December 2015 were taken into consideration, regardless of the publication language.
Study selection
A two-step procedure was used to identify references for inclusion. First, the titles and
abstracts of the references that resulted from the database searches were checked to see
whether they satisfied the inclusion criteria. One reviewer (JGH) screened all the references.
The second reviewer (ALF) then independently screened a 10% random selection. The first
reviewer proceeded individually if the level of agreement (Kappa) was 0.60. If enough
information could not be obtained from the title and abstract, those references were taken to
the next step of the selection process. In this second step, the full texts of the references
selected in the first step (including the references with insufficient information in the title and
abstract) were independently screened by the two reviewers. A third reviewer (RV) was
consulted if the first and second reviewer did not agree.
Methodological assessment
After the second selection step (see before), the methodological quality of the reviews was
determined with the Quality Assessment Checklist for Reviews developed by Oxman and
Guyatt (1991). Reviews with a score of 2 or less were considered to be of "low quality" and
were subsequently excluded.
Table 1. Inclusion criteria for the meta-review.
Eligibility criteria
Types of study. Systematic reviews that met the following criteria: (a) the review included a description of
search terms, (b) searches were conducted in Medline or PubMed and at least one other international
scientific database, and (c) the review included effect studies (RCT, CCT, or quasi experimental designs).
Types of participant. People with dementia, or dyads of primary caregivers and people with dementia, living in
the community.
Types of intervention. The systematic reviews had to focus on professional self-management support inter-
ventions. These interventions had to explicitly be geared to helping the person with dementia cope with
the dementia and its effects on their day-to-day lives. Additionally, there had to be personal contact
between the person with dementia and the health care professional. The review had to describe and
analyze the effects of self-management support interventions, and to draw an overall conclusion about the
interventions' effectiveness. Cognitive training was not deemed a self-management support intervention.
Types of outcome measure. Only systematic reviews discussing effects on persons with dementia
were included.

Results
The flow chart in Figure 1 shows the number of studies assessed, excluded, and included at
each stage of the selection process.
In the end, seven reviews were found that satisfied all the inclusion criteria (Cooper et al.,
2012; Corbett et al., 2012; Orgeta, Qazi, Spector, & Orrell, 2015; Reilly et al., 2015; Spijker
et al., 2008; Van't Leven et al., 2013; Zabalequi et al., 2014). One review was identified to
have "major flaws," based on a quality score of 3.0 (Corbett et al., 2012). Three reviews
received a quality score of 4.0 (Zabalequi et al., 2014), 5.0 (Cooper et al., 2012), or 6.0 (Van't
Leven et al., 2013) reflecting "minor flaws." Three reviews received a quality score of 7.0
indicating that they met all quality requirements of the Quality Assessment Checklist for
Reviews (Orgeta et al., 2015; Reilly et al., 2015; Spijker et al., 2008). Tables 2 and 3 show the
key features of these seven reviews.

Description of the interventions
The term "self-management support" is rarely mentioned explicitly in the seven reviews that
were included. However, if the above-mentioned definition based on Barlow et al. (2002) is
applied, the selected reviews do indeed consider interventions in which self-management was
a central component. Table 3 shows the elements that comprised the self-management sup-
port interventions we identified. Self-management support was often aimed at dealing with
problems affecting the psychological well-being of the person with dementia. The table also
shows that self-management is often combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or
coping interventions.
Professionals and a focus on managing psychological problems. The interventions were primarily
performed by psychologists, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists. Nursing staff were
only explicitly mentioned as professionals providing self-management interventions in two
of the seven reviews (Reilly et al., 2015; van't Leven et al., 2013). The interventions focused
primarily on managing psychological problems, for example, depression or anxiety. In addi-
tion, improvement of quality of life in general and/or postponing admission to a nursing
home was often an important aim of the interventions.
Effects. The seven systematic reviews that were included show effects for a number of out-
come variables in the person with dementia, for example, depression (Orgeta et al., 2015)
and the time to admission to a nursing home (Reilly et al., 2015). However, it was not
possible to draw conclusions from this about the effects of self-management support on
people with dementia. There are two key reasons for this.
In the first place, self-management support interventions often include other components
as well. A clear example of such a combined intervention can be seen in the study by
Burgener, Yang, Gilbert, and Marsh-Yant (2008), included in the systematic review by
Orgeta et al. (2015). Burgener et al. studied the effects of a support group in which
people with dementia learned how to resolve problems in their day-to-day lives, which
can be considered as a self-management intervention. However, this was combined with
tai chi exercises and CBT (Burgener et al., 2008). The combination of interventions meant
that the individual effects of the self-management components could not be distin-
guished properly.
The second reason was that four of the seven systematic reviews included studies of self-
management support interventions, but did not analyze them separately from studies of
other kinds of interventions. The review by Cooper et al. (2012) is one such example. It
included a study by Logsdon et al. (2010). Logsdon et al. researched the effects of a self-
management support intervention in which discussion groups of people with dementia and
their family caregivers talked together about how to deal with how dementia impacts social
and family relationships and about making plans for the future. In this review, the effects of
this self-management support intervention were analyzed together with those of cognitive
stimulation therapies that did not include any self-management support components
(Chapman, Weiner, Rackley, Hynan, & Zientz, 2004; Davis, Massman, & Doody, 2001;
Spector et al., 2003).

Discussion
Despite the fact that the reviews we examined showed positive effects, it is not possible at
this point to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of self-management support inter-
ventions on people with dementia. A main reason for this is that the self-management
support interventions that were studied were often combined with other kinds of interven-
tions such as CBT.
By excluding reviews with low methodological quality (score of 2 or less), we reduced the
risk of biased conclusions. Seven of the eight reviews included received a quality score of 4
or more indicating either minor or no flaws, which is also important for providing unbiased,
valid results.
However, a limitation was that the reviews did not label the interventions as "self-man-
agement support interventions." Guided by the explicit inclusion criterion that
"interventions had to explicitly be geared to helping the person with dementia cope with the
dementia and its effects on their day-to-day lives and there had to be personal contact between
the person with dementia and the healthcare professional," we decided whether interventions
concerned self-management support. This decision implied subjective judgments.
This meta-review also teaches us that existing self-management support interventions
(even if they are not always explicitly denoted as such) focus almost exclusively on the
psychological well-being of the person with dementia. Self-management support interven-
tions should however be wider in scope. In addition to psychological well-being, the
"relationship with relatives," "maintaining an active lifestyle," "techniques to cope with
memory change," and "information" are also important objectives for self-management
support interventions (Martin, Turner, Wallace, & Bradbury, 2013). Future interventions
should include one or more of these objectives as well in order to provide the best possible
support for self-management by people with dementia and those around them.
Accordingly, different outcome measures linked to the above-mentioned objectives
should be used in future research on the effectiveness of self-management support inter-
ventions for people with dementia. Examples are outcome measures that indicate "the qual-
ity of the relationship with family caregivers," "the number of social contacts," or
"knowledge about dementia."
Hence, future research is needed on the effects of self-management support interventions
on patients. At the moment, more information is available regarding the effects on relatives.
A previous meta-review (Huis in het Veld, Verkaik, Mistiaen, van Meijel, & Francke, 2015)
described effects of self-management support on informal caregivers of people with demen-
tia, for example, an increase of well-being, stress relieve and more quality of life. However,
in current health care in which patients themselves are also expected to execute self-
management, it is important to further investigate which kinds of self-management support
interventions are effective in particularly people with dementia and which are not.
The meta-review also revealed that self-management support is often provided by psy-
chologists, occupational therapists, and other therapists. It is striking that nurses were only
mentioned in two of the seven reviews, since self-management support fits with a core
competency of nurses, namely acting as an information and education resource for clients
seeking to improve life styles, and who have to cope with changes in health and disability
and death (ICN, 2008). Nurses are often in closer contact with the person with dementia
than psychologists and occupational therapists, for example, and they accordingly see self-
management support as part of their job (Verkaik, van Antwerpen-Hoogenraad, de Veer,
14 Dementia 0(0)
Francke, & Huis in het Veld, 2016). Nursing professionals can incorporate self-management
support in the regular care that they deliver to people with dementia.
