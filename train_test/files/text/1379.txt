Background and Purpose--Although the short-term risks of stroke and types of stroke associated with isolated systolic
hypertension (ISH) and borderline isolated systolic hypertension (BISH) have been described, the long-term effects of
these hypertensive conditions, particularly in younger individuals, are unclear. We performed this study to evaluate the
long-term risks of stroke, type of stroke, and predictors of stroke associated with ISH and BISH and how this risk
compares with that for persons with diastolic hypertension and normotension.
Methods--We used the 20-year follow-up data for 12 344 adults aged 25 to 74 years who participated in the First National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Follow-Up Study to determine the aforementioned risks. Blood pressure (BP)
measurements of the participants were obtained during baseline evaluation. ISH was defined as systolic BP
160 mm Hg and diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. BISH was defined as systolic BP between 140 and 159 mm Hg and
diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Diastolic hypertension was defined as a diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Normotension was defined
as systolic BP 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Incidence of stroke overall and incidence of ischemic stroke
and intracerebral hemorrhage were determined from a review of hospital records and death certificates. Relative risk
(RR) of stroke and stroke type in association with each hypertensive category was determined by Cox proportional
hazards analysis after adjustment for potential confounding variables.
Results--Among the 12 344 participants, hypertension was categorized as ISH (n493), BISH (n1241), and diastolic
hypertension (n3954). Normotension was observed in 6656 persons. After adjustment for differences in age, sex,
education, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking, a significantly higher RR
for all strokes was observed in participants with ISH (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.4) and BISH (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to
1.8) than those with normotension. The risk was significantly higher for ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage in
persons with ISH and BISH. Among the 1734 persons with either ISH or BISH, the risk of stroke was independently
associated with older age, diabetes mellitus, and systolic BP 180 mm Hg.
Conclusions--Increased risks for stroke, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage were observed in patients with
BISH, similar to those associated with ISH and diastolic hypertension. Future clinical trials are required to evaluate the
effect of antihypertensive treatment in younger patients with BISH and ISH. (Stroke. 2002;33:2781-2788.)

Acommon belief among patients and some practitioners is
that elevated diastolic pressure is more important than
elevated systolic pressure. However, recent evidence suggests
the importance of systolic blood pressure in determining the
risks of myocardial infarction and stroke.1­3 Two important
categories of systolic hypertension have been recognized,
which include isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and bor-
derline isolated systolic hypertension (BISH). ISH is charac-
terized by reduced vascular compliance, often in combination
with increased peripheral resistance. In absolute terms, ISH is
defined as an elevated systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg
and a normal diastolic blood pressure (90 mm Hg).2,3 BISH
was introduced as a category of hypertension by the Joint
National Committee in 19854 and further emphasized in
19885 and 19936 in reports on detection, evaluation, and
treatment of high blood pressure. The entity was further
stressed in the World Health Organization guidelines.7 BISH
is defined as systolic blood pressure between 140 and
159 mm Hg and normal diastolic blood pressure
(90 mm Hg).4 The prevalence of systolic hypertension
varies, depending on the population screened. In the Hyper-
tension Detection and Follow-Up Program,8 blood pressures

were measured in 158 906 individuals from 14 communities
throughout the United States during 1972­1973. The mea-
surements were obtained at the homes of these individuals. Of
the total population screened, 2.4% had ISH (systolic blood
pressure 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure
90 mm Hg). ISH was present for 0.5% of those aged 30 to
39 years and 6.8% of those aged 60 to 69 years. The
prevalence of ISH was greater in blacks and women than in
both whites and men. The prevalence of ISH was 5.3% in
white men, 6.4% in black men, 7.4% in white women, and
8.3% in black women. In an analysis of 30-year follow-up
data from the Framingham Study, Wilking et al9 reported that
ISH occurred in 14% of men and 23% of women aged 65
years and accounted for 57% of all hypertensive conditions in
men and 65% in women. Although the risk of stroke overall
and according to type and subtype has been evaluated in some
clinical trials involving participants with ISH, the long-term
natural history of ISH and BISH has not been determined,
particularly in younger age groups. We used 20-year
follow-up data from the first National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiological
Follow-Up Study (NHEFS) to determine the risks of stroke
and types of stroke that are associated with ISH and BISH.
For a comparative analysis, we estimated the risk of these
outcomes in patients with diastolic hypertension and normo-
tension. We also evaluated the factors that increase the risk of
stroke in patients with these hypertensive conditions.
Subjects and Methods
NHANES I was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during
1971­1975 to collect health-related information on a probability
sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the United
States.10­14 A sample of approximately 32 000 persons aged between
1 and 74 years was included. The NHANES I was designed so that
certain population groups considered at high risk of malnutrition
(such as the elderly, those living in poverty areas, and women of
child-bearing age) were oversampled at preset rates. Adjusted
sampling weights were computed within 60 age/sex/race categories
to inflate the sample to closely reflect the US civilian noninstitution-
alized population at the midpoint of the survey. A subset of 14 407
NHANES I participants who were between the ages of 25 and 74
years (at the time of the baseline survey) received a more detailed
health examination. The NHEFS comprised a series of studies to
provide follow-up data on these 14 407 NHANES I participants. The
NHEFS included 4 periods of follow-up: 1982­1984, 1986, 1987,
and 1992. The first wave of data collection was performed during
1982­1984. It included tracing the cohort; conducting personal
interviews with subject or proxy; measuring pulse rate, weight, and
blood pressure of surviving participants; collecting hospital and
nursing home records of overnight stay; and collecting death
certificates of decedents. Subsequent follow-up of the NHEFS was
conducted with the same design and data collection procedures
except that a 30-minute computer-assisted telephone interview was
administered in place of a personal interview and no physical
measurements were made. Tracing and data collection in the NHEFS
were very high, with 94% of the study population traced for each
completed wave of follow-up. The interview rates ranged from 91%
to 96% of the participants traced. By the end of the 1992 NHEFS
survey period, 90% of the 11 195 subjects not reported dead in
previous surveys had been successfully traced.15 Approximately
32% of the NHEFS cohort was known to be deceased, with a death
certificate available for 98% of the 4604 NHEFS decedents. An
analysis was performed to determine the effect of age at baseline
evaluation on loss to follow-up. Age at baseline was categorized into
five 10-year age groups. Rates of loss to follow-up were highest for
participants aged 45 years (14%) and decreased for subsequent age
categories (5% and 6% for participants aged 45 to 64 years and 65
years, respectively).
Definitions of Stroke Events and Stroke Types
Participants were considered to have experienced a stroke event if
they were hospitalized or died during the 20-year follow-up period
with primary diagnoses categorized by codes 431 to 434.9 or 437 to
437.1 according to the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Our definition of
stroke event included both ischemic and hemorrhagic events but not
transient ischemic events (ICD-9-CM code 435). ICD-9-CM codes
were assigned on the basis of the underlying cause of death listed on
the participant's death certificate. Stroke events were further classi-
fied as intracerebral hemorrhage in participants with ICD-9-CM
codes 431 to 432.9 or as cerebral infarction in those with codes 433
to 434.9 or 436 to 437.1.
Definitions of Hypertensive Conditions
Blood pressure status was categorized on the basis of measurements
obtained at physical examination during the NHANES I baseline
clinical evaluation. One blood pressure measurement was obtained
from all participants in a sitting position and was used for the present
analysis. ISH was defined as systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg
and diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. BISH was defined as
systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and 160 mm Hg and
diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. Diastolic hypertension was
defined as diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. Normotension was
defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood
pressure 90 mm Hg. A subset of persons (n6844) evaluated in
the NHANES I baseline survey had 3 consecutive blood pressure
measurements performed. We determined the correlation between
single blood pressure recordings with the average of 3 consecutive
blood pressure recordings. Pearson product-moment coefficient was
used to test this correlation with the use of JMP statistical software
(SAS Institute Inc). A high correlation coefficient of 0.95 and 0.92
for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was observed
between single recording and average of multiple recordings.
Study Variables
Known cerebrovascular risk factors that were identified as potential
confounding variables in our study of the association between
hypertensive conditions and stroke events were age, sex, race/
ethnicity (black, white, other), educational attainment (12 years,
12 years), serum cholesterol level (200 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL),
body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of the height in meters), diabetes mellitus, and cigarette
smoking (never, former, and current). All measurements were
obtained prospectively during the NHANES I baseline interview.
Information regarding the status of cigarette smoking was obtained
from the 1982 follow-up. Socioeconomic data and smoking status
were self-reported. Diabetes mellitus was determined from the
patient's report of a physician's diagnosis. Trained examiners mea-
sured the height and weight of each participant during the NHANES
I physical examination.
Statistical Analyses
Because the duration of follow-up varied among the participants,
Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to estimate the relative
risk (RR) for stroke and stroke types. We included all patients in the
analysis and censored the data for patients who died from noncar-
diovascular deaths at the time of death. RR for stroke and stroke
types for each type of hypertension was estimated after adjustment
for the established cerebrovascular risk factors. The Cox propor-
tional hazard model was adjusted for differences in age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, cigarette smoking, serum cholesterol level,
diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and body mass
index. In the present model age was dichotomized at 60 or 60
years. The cutoff for dichotomization is based on the age definitions

used by previous clinical trials evaluating the effect of treated and
untreated hypertension on cardiovascular diseases.16­18 The data
regarding diabetic status were unavailable for a large proportion of
participants. The exact relationship between this category of diabetes
and stroke is undefined and probably not comparable to participants
either with or without documented diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we
entered the variable of diabetes mellitus as absent, present, or
unknown. A second logistic regression analysis was performed
without including serum cholesterol levels in the model. This
analysis was performed because serum cholesterol levels may be
associated with ischemic stroke but not with intracerebral hemor-
rhage.19 Furthermore, an inverse association has been suggested
between serum cholesterol levels and intracerebral hemorrhage.20
Because the exclusion of serum cholesterol levels from the model did
not affect the results, the results of the analysis including serum
cholesterol levels are presented. All the variables were entered in the
model simultaneously to adjust for the potential confounding effect
of each variable.
A separate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to
evaluate the effect of the following variables: age, sex, absolute
measurement value of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes
mellitus, smoking, serum cholesterol, body mass index, and use of
antihypertensive medication on risk of stroke in participants with
ISH or BISH. A subset analysis was performed in patients with
diastolic hypertension to determine the effect of systolic blood
pressure on the risk of stroke compared with normotensive persons.
The multivariate-adjusted risk of stroke was analyzed for different
levels of systolic blood pressure (120, 121 to 150, 151 to 180, and
180 mm Hg). A probability value of 0.05 was considered signifi-
cant. All analyses were performed with the use of SPSS.
Results
A total of 14 407 persons aged 25 to 74 years underwent an
interview and examination during the NHANES I baseline
survey. A total of 1697 persons were lost to follow-up.
Another 366 participants were excluded from the present
analysis because of history of stroke or intracerebral hemor-
rhage (n299) or unavailability of blood pressure readings
(n67). Those who died from causes other than stroke
(n2738) were censored at the time of death and included in
the analysis. Among the total participants included in the
analysis (n12 344), hypertension was categorized as ISH
(n493), BISH (n1241), and diastolic hypertension
(n3954). Normotension was observed in 6656 persons.
During the 20-year follow-up period, stroke events occurred
in 825 participants (7%). The rates of ischemic stroke and
intracerebral hemorrhage were 745 (6%) and 198 (2%),
respectively (118 participants had experienced both types of
stroke events). Baseline characteristics of the participants
according to blood pressure status are provided in Table 1.
Participants with normotension were more likely to be
younger and to have attained higher levels of education (12

years) than those with ISH, BISH, or diastolic hypertension.
Moreover, the mean body mass index and mean serum
cholesterol levels were lower in the normotensive cohort than
in participants with ISH, BISH, or diastolic hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus was more frequent in patients with diastolic
hypertension.
Table 2 provides the stroke rates and age- and multivari-
ate-adjusted RRs of all strokes, ischemic stroke, and intrace-
rebral hemorrhage according to blood pressure status. Partic-
ipants with ISH, BISH, or diastolic hypertension were 3 to 6
times more likely to have strokes than those with normoten-
sion. The stroke rate was 2 times higher in persons with
ISH than in those with either BISH or diastolic hypertension.
A significantly higher RR for all strokes was observed in
participants with ISH (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.4) and BISH
(RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.8) compared with normotensive
persons after adjustment for confounding factors through
multivariate analysis. An increased RR for both ischemic
stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage was found in persons
with ISH, BISH, and diastolic hypertension compared with
those with normotension.
Table 3 demonstrates the factors that contributed to in-
creased risk for all strokes among participants with ISH or
BISH (n1734). The risk of stroke was higher in persons
aged 45 to 64 years and those aged 65 years than in those
aged 45 years. Other independent variables associated with
risk of stroke were diabetes mellitus (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to
3.3) and systolic blood pressure 180 mm Hg (RR, 2.4; 95%
CI, 1.5 to 4.0). Regular or occasional use of antihypertensive
medication was not associated with the risk of stroke.
In the subset analysis including patients with diastolic
hypertension, there was a stepwise increase in the risk for
stroke with higher systolic blood pressure. Compared with
normotensive patients, the multivariate-adjusted risk of stroke
for each category of systolic blood pressure was as follows:
120 mm Hg: RR, 1.0 (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.3); 121 to
150 mm Hg: RR, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9); 151 to
180 mm Hg: RR, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.7); and 180 mm Hg:
RR, 3.1 (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.0).
Discussion
Our analysis showed that each category of hypertension
represented in this study confers an increased risk for stroke,
including both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage.
ISH appeared to pose the highest risk for both types of stroke
events. The stroke risk for persons with BISH appears to
approximate that for persons with diastolic hypertension. Our
analysis also identified characteristics in persons with ISH or
BISH that are associated with an increased risk of stroke.
ISH as a Risk Factor for Stroke
Kannel et al21 reported prospective data from the Framing-
ham Study relating systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
pulse-wave configuration, and patient age to future stroke
incidents. Subjects with ISH experienced 2 to 4 times as
many strokes as did normotensive persons. Although diastolic
blood pressure was related to stroke in subjects with systolic
hypertension, the diastolic component added little to the risk
assessment in men and was unrelated to the overall incidence
of stroke. Systolic pressure seemed to be the more potent
contributor of stroke. The Copenhagen City Heart Study,22 a
prospective population survey, evaluated the prevalence of
ISH and associated risk of major cardiovascular events. The
risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in association with
ISH was assessed in 6621 subjects aged 50 years who were
not receiving antihypertensive or cardiac medicine and had
no history of stroke or myocardial infarction. The prevalence
of ISH showed an age-related increase from 3% in 55-year-

old subjects to 13% in 72-year-old subjects. The RR of stroke
after adjustment for other risk factors was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.6 to
5.3) for women and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) for men. This
was the highest RR among all hypertensive groups. The
population-attributable risk for stroke associated with ISH
was estimated as 30%.
The risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke, all
cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality associated with
ISH among the middle-aged population was determined in
10 333 men and 11 160 women aged 25 to 64 years without
history of myocardial infarction or stroke over a 15-year
follow-up period.23 Coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascu-
lar disease, and mortality from all causes among men and
women aged 45 to 64 years increased with increasing levels of
systolic blood pressure. Among women aged 45 to 64 years, ISH
increased the RR of these fatal events. Among men aged 45 to
64 years, only deaths related to coronary heart disease were
significantly associated with ISH.
Petrovitch et al24 examined the prevalence of ISH in a
population of 8006 Japanese-American men aged 45 to 68
years and compared rates of stroke among those with ISH,
isolated diastolic hypertension, combined systolic-diastolic
hypertension, and normotension. Men with ISH had the
highest rates of stroke, followed by men with systolic-dia-
stolic hypertension. Men with isolated diastolic hypertension
had rates only slightly higher than those of men in the
normotension group. RR adjusted for other risk factors varied
by age group. For men aged 45 to 54 years, RRs of stroke for
subjects with ISH, isolated diastolic hypertension, and sys-
tolic-diastolic hypertension (compared with normotensive
subjects) were 4.8, 1.4, and 4.3, respectively. For men aged
55 to 68 years, the same RRs were 1.2, 1.8, and 1.7.

subjects with BISH (according to blood pressure measure-
ments at baseline examination) had an excess risk of cardio-
vascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.74)
and death from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.57;
95% CI, 1.24 to 2.00) compared with normotensive subjects.
They were also at significantly higher risk for coronary artery
disease (hazard ratio, 1.44), stroke and transient ischemic
attacks (hazard ratio, 1.42), and congestive heart failure
(hazard ratio, 1.60).
Impact of Antihypertensive Treatment
Recent clinical trials demonstrate the importance of treatment
of ISH and risk reduction for stroke and other cardiovascular
diseases in the elderly.16,17 Staessen et al26 performed a
quantitative overview of 8 clinical trials to evaluate the risk
associated with systolic blood pressure in treated and un-
treated elderly patients (60 years) with ISH. In these trials,
15 693 participants with ISH were followed up for 3 to 8
years. Various antihypertensive medications were used to
treat ISH. These included thiazides, calcium channel block-
ers, a combination of thiazide and triamterene, -blockers,
and thiazide in combination with either amiloride or a
-blocker. Among 7757 placebo-treated patients, major car-
diovascular complications occurred in 835 (10.8%) and death
occurred in 734 (9.5%) persons. Among 7936 patients who
received pharmacological treatment, major complications
occurred in 647 (8.1%) and death occurred in 656 (8.3%)
persons. Pharmacological treatment of ISH reduced total
mortality by 13%, cardiovascular mortality by 18%, all
cardiovascular complications by 26%, stroke by 30%, and
coronary events by 33%. We observed that in patients with
BISH or ISH, antihypertensive treatment did not affect the
risk for stroke. This finding may be secondary to treated
hypertensives having had years of uncontrolled hypertension.
Giles et al,27 in an analysis of the NHANES I cohort,
observed that among persons with a blood pressure 140/
90 mm Hg, persons who were receiving medication had a
mean blood pressure of 164/94 mm Hg, while persons who
reported not taking medication had a mean blood pressure of
152/92 mm Hg. The lack of beneficial effect of antihyperten-
sive medication is probably attributable to the presence of
more severe hypertension in treated patients.
Stroke Types and Subtypes and ISH
We observed that the risk of either ischemic stroke or
intracerebral hemorrhage is higher in persons with ISH and
BISH. In a subgroup analysis in the Systolic Hypertension in
the Elderly Program (SHEP), Perry et al28 evaluated the
incidence of stroke types and subtypes in 4736 men and
women aged 60 years with ISH from 16 clinical centers in
the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to
receive treatment with either chlorthalidone (12 mg daily),
chlorthalidone (same dose) with atenolol (25 mg daily) or
reserpine (0.05 mg daily), or a placebo. They were followed
for an average period of 4.5 years. A total of 85 and 132
participants in the active treatment and placebo groups,
respectively, had ischemic stroke; 9 and 19 participants,
respectively, had hemorrhagic strokes. A significant reduc-
tion was observed in the risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke in the active treatment group. No significant difference
was observed in the risk for stroke of unknown type. Among
patients with ischemic stroke, a significant reduction was
observed in the RR for ischemic strokes classified as lacunar
and undetermined. The RR was not significantly different for
embolic and atherosclerotic ischemic stroke.
ISH appeared to have a stronger association with both
ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage compared with
BISH and diastolic hypertension (Table 2). No clear evidence
exists to support a differential effect of ISH and diastolic
hypertension in predisposing to ischemic or hemorrhagic
stroke. Davis et al29 determined the risk factors for stroke and
stroke subtype in the SHEP trial. In the multivariate analysis,
higher systolic blood pressure was associated with an in-
creased risk for stroke and ischemic stroke. No definite
relationship could be demonstrated between systolic blood
pressure and hemorrhagic stroke, atherosclerotic ischemic
stroke, lacunar ischemic stroke, or embolic stroke. However,
the analysis was limited because of the small number of
patients in each of the outcome categories. A report of a
combined analysis of 13 cohorts from eastern Asia reported
the effect of baseline diastolic pressure on risk of ischemic
and hemorrhagic stroke in 124 774 participants with 837 214
person-years of observation.19 Logistic regression analyses
demonstrated a somewhat stronger association between dia-
stolic blood pressure and hemorrhagic stroke in comparison
with ischemic stroke.
Persons With ISH and BISH at Risk for Stroke
We found a higher risk of stroke among participants with ISH
or BISH aged 45 years. Other persons at higher risk
included diabetics, and those with systolic blood pressures
180 mm Hg. Previous studies have recognized the prognos-
tic importance of age and diabetes mellitus for determining
the risk of stroke among patients with ISH. Davis et al29
performed proportional hazards analyses of data from the
SHEP to determine risk factors for stroke and stroke type in
persons with ISH. During an average follow-up of 4.5 years,
384 strokes or transient ischemic attacks and 262 strokes
(including 217 ischemic, 66 lacunar, 26 atherosclerotic, and
25 embolic strokes) were documented. The authors concluded
that in older persons with ISH, history of diabetes and
smoking are important risk factors for lacunar stroke, whereas
carotid bruit and age are important risk factors for atheroscle-
rotic and embolic stroke, respectively. In the SHEP pilot
project, Siegel et al30 examined the effect of known cardio-
vascular risk factors in younger persons to see whether they
were applicable in an elderly population. They prospectively
followed up 551 men and women aged 60 years and who
had pretreatment systolic blood pressures 160 mm Hg and
diastolic blood pressures 90 mm Hg. After adjustment for
confounding variables, age, level of education, history of
cardiovascular event, and smoking remained significant pre-
dictors of a first-time cardiovascular event. We did not find a
relationship between diastolic blood pressure and risk of
stroke. In a subgroup analysis of the 4736 participants in

Downloaded from
SHEP, Somes et al31 found, for persons with ISH, that a
decrease of 5 mm Hg in diastolic BP increased the risk for
stroke (RR, 1.14), coronary heart disease (RR, 1.08), and
cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.11).
Issues Related to Data Interpretation
We used the blood pressure recording from baseline evalua-
tion to define various forms of hypertension. Blood pressure
is not static but rather a continuous variable that changes from
minute to minute.32 Therefore, casual blood pressure readings
represent a minute part of the entire 24-hour circadian blood
pressure pattern. In addition, some patients may manifest a
transient stress response when blood pressure is measured in
the presence of a medical professional (white coat hyperten-
sion). Perloff et al33 evaluated 1076 persons with both office
and ambulatory blood pressure measurements. The ambula-
tory measurements were obtained with a semiautomatic
patient-activated portable device (10 to 40 measurements per
patient over 1 to 2 days). The ambulatory blood pressure
measurements were lower than office measurements in 78%
of the patients. The effect of this overestimation by office
blood pressure measurement was most prominent in women
and persons with borderline hypertension. The relationship
between the measurements generated by these 2 methods
correlated in a linear manner. Our use of a single blood
pressure measurement to define various forms of hyperten-
sion may have led to inclusion of nonhypertensive patients in
the BISH category. Because of the presence of normotensive
persons, the actual risk of stroke in persons with BISH may
be higher than that determined in our study.
We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) codes from discharge abstracts and death
certificates to identify incident cases of stroke and stroke
subtypes. Broderick et al34 determined the accuracy and yield
of ICD-9-CM codes for cases of stroke and transient ischemic
attack in a population-based study. The ICD-9 diagnoses
were compared with the diagnoses made by the study
neurologist after review of clinical and radiographic informa-
tion for each potential case. When primary discharge diag-
noses of ICD-9-CM codes 430 to 436 were used, the true
positive rate was 83% and the yield of cases of stroke and
transient ischemic attack was 84%. The validity of death
certificate diagnosis of stroke and its type as the underlying
cause of death was investigated in a sample of in-hospital
deaths of possible stroke cases from the Minnesota Heart
Survey.35 Relative to a standardized physician diagnosis,
positive predictive values for the death certificate diagnosis
were 100% for all types of stroke, 82% for intracranial
hemorrhage, and 97% for nonhemorrhagic stroke. On the
basis of results of previous population-based studies, we think
that hospital discharge or death certificate diagnoses are
sufficiently accurate to justify their use in epidemiologic
studies. Probably most important, the validity of ICD-9
diagnoses does not differ by strata defined by blood pressure.
The follow-up rates differed by age, with the lowest tracing
rate observed in participants aged 45 years. Because the
majority of strokes occur among older adults, participants lost
to follow-up could not have substantially biased the results
presented in this report.
Conclusions
We observed that BISH is a category of hypertension that is
associated with an increased risk of stroke, ischemic stroke,
and intracerebral hemorrhage, which is similar to that asso-
ciated with ISH and diastolic hypertension. The increased risk
of stroke was also observed in the younger group of partici-
pants (aged 45 to 64 years) who had systolic hypertension.
Future clinical trials should evaluate the effect of antihyper-
tensive treatment in younger persons with BISH and ISH.
