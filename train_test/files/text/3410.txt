Abstract
Despite the recent proliferation of price transparency tools, consumer use and awareness of these tools is low. Better
strategies to increase the use of price transparency tools are needed. To inform such efforts, we studied who is most likely
to use a price transparency tool. We conducted a cross-sectional study of use of the Truven Treatment Cost Calculator
among employees at 2 large companies for the 12 months following the introduction of the tool in 2011-2012. We examined
frequency of sign-ons and used multivariate logistic regression to identify which demographic and health care factors were
associated with greater use of the tool. Among the 70408 families offered the tool, 7885 (11%) used it at least once and 854
(1%) used it at least 3 times in the study period. Greater use of the tool was associated with younger age, living in a higher
income community, and having a higher deductible. Families with moderate annual out-of-pocket medical spending ($1000-
$2779) were also more likely to use the tool. Consistent with prior work, we find use of this price transparency tool is low
and not sustained over time. Employers and payers need to pursue strategies to increase interest in and engagement with
health care price information, particularly among consumers with higher medical spending.

Background
Price transparency tools that allow patients to compare prices
of health care services across providers have proliferated in
recent years; more than half of states have laws requiring
either payers or providers to disclose pricing information1
and many employers and health plans offer their own tools.
Prior studies have found that patients who use price transpar-
ency tools are more likely to receive lower priced care for
select services.2-5 However, recent studies have shown that
the promise of price transparency to drive lower spending
has not yet been realized. Offering price transparency tools is
not associated with lower overall spending primarily because
few people with access to such tools use them to shop for
lower priced providers.6-8 As such, strategies to increase use
of price transparency tools will be an important focus of
future work. To inform such efforts, we examined patient and
market characteristics to describe who is most likely to use a
price transparency tool.
Methods
The Truven Treatment Cost Calculator tool is a Web-based plat-
form on which patients can search for personalized estimates
of expected out-of-pocket costs for a range of services across
providers in their community. We studied use of this tool among
employees at 2 large companies.9 One company introduced the
tool on April 1, 2011, and the other on January 1, 2012; we
examined use of the tool for the 12 months following introduc-
tion by each employer. The employers marketed the tool to their
employees via communications during open enrollment includ-
ing emails and paper mailings, and used small prizes and lotter-
ies to encourage employees to sign up for the tool.
We obtained detailed search log data to describe each
search by employees and their dependents, including the date
of search and the service searched for. We linked these search
data for each family to the family's insurance claims and
enrollment files from the year prior to the introduction of the

price transparency tool using the Truven Health MarketScan
Commercial Claims and Encounters database. We conducted
analyses at the family level because family members may
share an online account and search for services on behalf of
other members of their family. Any family in which at least 1
person used the price transparency tool within the study
period was categorized as a "user."
We constructed variables to describe provider supply and
price variation for counties and metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs). First, we categorized counties with fewer than three
hospitals as low hospital supply counties. Second, we calcu-
lated the price variation in an MSA based on the coefficient
of variation for the price of office visits and then categorized
MSAs into the first (low), second (moderate), or third (high)
tertile of price variation. For this price variation metric, we
used CPT 99213 as a proxy for all office visits, as this CPT
code is the most common evaluation and management CPT
code used by physicians. Third, we defined a provider price
index for each MSA (see Online Appendix S1 for details),
and classified MSAs into tertiles of this price index.
We conducted multivariate logistic regressions at the fam-
ily level to quantify the association between demographic
and health care factors and use of the tool. The model covari-
ates were related to employee demographics (employee age,
median income in their zip code, whether they had any cov-
ered dependent(s)), provider supply and price in the employ-
ee's area of residence (hospital supply, provider price
variation tertile, provider price index tertile), and use of med-
ical care and insurance (whether anyone in the family had a
comorbidity, and total medical spending and deducible level
prior to the introduction of the price transparency tool).
Employees faced the same deductible in the year before and
year after the tool was introduced. We did not control for
marketing efforts in our multivariate analyses because such
efforts affected both users and non-users. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis where we removed total medical spend-
ing from the multivariate model and instead used an indica-
tor for whether the family had used a "shoppable" health care
service in the prior year, as some medical spending is not
well suited to shopping in advance of care. We defined shop-
pable services as lab tests, imaging, outpatient procedures,
evaluation and management services, and maternity care.
Results
Among the 70
408 families offered the price transparency
tool across the 2 employers, 21% had a deductible less than
$500 and 26% had a deductible over $1500 (Table 1). One
third (33%) of families were enrolled in preferred provider
organization plans and two thirds (67%) were enrolled in
high-deductible/consumer-directed health plans.
Of families offered the tool, 7885 (11%) used the tool at
least once in the 12 months following its launch, and 854
(1%) families used the tool at least 3 times in those 12 months.
Of the families who used the tool in the first 12 months, 70%
(5542) signed on only once. Figure 1 shows the number of
first, second, and third sign-ons to the tool during the study
period; each observed spike in sign-ons followed marketing
efforts by the employers to increase the use of the tool.
Use of the tool was more common among families with
younger employees, at least 1 dependent, and those living in
areas with higher median income (Table 1). Families living
in an MSA with greater variation in health care prices, with
high deductibles, and with total medical spending greater
than $1000 were also more likely to use the tool. A sensitiv-
ity analysis that substituted any receipt of a shoppable ser-
vice for total medical spending in the multivariate model
showed similar results (Online Appendix Table S1).
Discussion
Use of this price transparency tool was relatively low and
most families who used the tool did so only once. These
results echo prior research finding that few people offered
price transparency tools use them6-8 and that younger people
are more likely to use a price transparency tool.3,8 Recent
work found that those who used a transparency tool had
higher medical spending than non-users.8 Our findings high-
light that this is not a monotonic relationship, and that the
highest rate of tool use was among those with moderate
spending. We also add to the literature by describing higher
rates of tool use in markets with greater price variation.
Our findings suggest several strategies for promoting
greater use of price transparency tools. Currently, tool use is
higher among groups that are more likely to have Internet
fluency, such as younger employees and those from higher
income areas. Targeted marketing to groups with lower use
rates may be important to improve access to price informa-
tion across all groups. Our findings support the idea that mar-
keting is effective in increasing tool use, as we observe that
marketing is associated with short-term spikes in the use of
the tool. However, more prolonged marketing efforts may be
needed to remind people of the tool's availability.
In addition to marketing, other strategies to promote sus-
tained use of price transparency tools are necessary.Although
our data cannot explain why most families do not continue to
use the tool, prior research has emphasized that improving
the clarity and format of information is essential to increas-
ing the use of online provider price and quality data.4,10,11
Increasing the salience of the tool may also be important.
Ideally, patients should receive reminders of the availability
of the tool at the time they are thinking about selecting a
health care provider, for example, when a prior authorization
is requested for a patient or when a patient receives an expla-
nation of benefits.
Families with the highest total medical spending were less
likely to use the tool than families with moderate spending.
Those with high spending often reach their deductibles and
maximum out-of-pocket limits, and therefore are likely less
price sensitive. Different benefit designs such as reference

aAll unadjusted rates across demographic subgroups are statistically significant at the P < .001 level within the subgroup except for employees residing in a
county with low versus not low hospital supply.
bLow provider supply counties have fewer than 3 hospitals.
cArea provider price variation is defined as the coefficient of variation (COV) for the price of office visits in the family's metropolitan statistical area
(MSA). Low, moderate, and high variation are tertiles of COV in the sample (low-variation COV = 10.3-22.4, moderate-variation COV = 22.5-26.8, high-
variation COV = 26.9-425.3).
dThe area price index is defined in Online Appendix S1. Low price, moderate price, and high price are tertiles of the price index in the sample (low price
index = 0.657-0.967, moderate price index = 0.968-1.008, high price index = 1.009-2.379).

pricing may be needed to make these higher-spenders more
sensitive to price information.
Our analyses have important limitations. We only observe 2
large employers and we do not know what fraction of the sign-
ons to the tool represent situations where a consumer was truly
shopping for health care services, and not merely making use
of other features available on the tool such as learning about
their benefit design. In addition, we are not able to observe
other variables that may be associated with use of the tool, such
as employees'out-of-pocket maximum limits, and we are miss-
ing deductible information for 10% of the sample.
Despite widespread enthusiasm for price transparency to
help patients select lower priced providers, our analysis shows
that the use of a price transparency tool is low, not sustained
over time, and concentrated among consumers who are more
price sensitive because they have higher deductibles or live in
areas with substantial variation in provider prices.
