Perceived Complexity of Care, Perceived
Autonomy, and Career Satisfaction Among Primary
Care Physicians
David Katerndahl, MD, MA, Michael Parchman, MD, MPH, and Robert Wood, DrPH
Background: The purpose of this study was to examine relationships of both perceived autonomy and
perceived complexity of care with career satisfaction.
Methods: This secondary analysis used 3 consecutive surveys of family physicians, internists, and
pediatricians from the Community Tracking Survey. Two-way analysis of variance assessed interaction
effects of perceived complexity of care and perceived autonomy on satisfaction. Logistic regression anal-
ysis identified physician characteristics, practice characteristics, practice improvement strategies, per-
ceived complexity, and perceived autonomy that accounted for variance in career satisfaction among
physicians.
Results: Although 24% to 27% of physicians felt perceived complexity of care expected was greater
than it should be, 83% to 86% felt free to make clinical decisions. Approximately 80% of physicians
were satisfied with their careers. Differences in probability of career satisfaction were highly significant
(P < .001) for both perceived complexity of care and perceived autonomy as well as their interaction. A
multiphysician practice; the ability to obtain high quality ancillary services (such as physical therapy,
home health care, and nutritional counseling); managed care revenue, lower levels of perceived com-
plexity of expected care; and perceived autonomy were consistently associated with satisfaction.
Conclusion: Higher perceived autonomy and lower perceived patient complexity as higher than de-
sirable were associated with high career satisfaction among primary care physicians. (J Am Board Fam
Med 2009;22:24­33.)
Despite the positive impact that primary care has
on population health and health care systems,1,2
there is a growing shortage of primary care physi-
cians.3 Further evidence of this shortage is the
observation that specialist physicians are providing
primary care services.4 Even more alarming is the
decline in interest in primary care among graduat-
ing medical students.5,6
The diminishing numbers of primary care phy-
sicians (PCPs) reflect the decreased attractiveness
of primary care as a career to new physicians and
the loss of established physicians because of retire-
ment and "burnout."7 Recent surveys among US
PCPs found that only 33% report being very sat-
isfied.8 However, US PCPs may be even more
satisfied than those from other countries.9­12 One
explanation for diminishing satisfaction among
PCPs may be a decreasing sense of professional
autonomy.13
PCPs are experiencing a loss of perceived auton-
omy,14 possibly because of incentives designed to
decrease services and expenses.8 This decline in the
sense of autonomy is greater among PCPs com-
pared with specialists.13 Even though US family
physicians rate their ability to order tests as greater
when compared with their Canadian counterparts,
they also feel that their health care system is more
in need of change.12 Overall, the situation is so
poor for US PCPs that more than half report a
sense of powerlessness.14
In addition to a loss of perceived autonomy,
PCPs are managing patients with much more com-
plex and demanding problems. Patients with mul-
tiple chronic illnesses are now the norm, rather
than the exception, in primary care clinics.15,16 In
addition, guideline-recommended services and
treatment regimens for any one chronic disease are

significantly more complex today than they were a
few short years ago.17 It is possible that the cogni-
tive and emotional demands placed on PCPs by
these types of patients have had an adverse impact
on career satisfaction.
The purpose of this study was to examine the
relationships of both perceived autonomy and per-
ceived complexity of care with career satisfaction in
a nationally representative sample of PCPs. We
were primarily interested in these relationships af-
ter controlling for physician demographic charac-
teristics and characteristics of the practice environ-
ment.
Methods
Sample
This study was a secondary analysis of data col-
lected in 3 waves of the Community Tracking Sur-
vey (1996 to 1997, 1998 to 1999, and 2000 to
2001); these waves included different participating
physicians. Data from the 2004 to 2005 survey were
not included because many of the variables differed.
The sampling strategy using American Medical As-
sociation and American Osteopathic Association
files was designed to produce a sample representa-
tive of physicians providing direct patient care.18,19
Office- and hospital-based physicians who had
completed training and provided at least 20 hours
of direct patient care weekly were included with
PCPs oversampled. Of the original 18,947 eligible
physicians in 1996, 12,385 (65%) were interviewed
over the telephone. Item nonresponse rates were
generally below 3%.
The Community Tracking Survey used a com-
plex design with 60 sites. Although some physicians
completed more than one panel, the public access
files used in this survey cannot identify changes in
individual physician responses over time. Accord-
ing to study documentation, "it is suitable for most
researchers who wish to perform analyses at the
national level and do not anticipate using the site-
level information in their analysis"20; site-level in-
formation was not used in this analysis. For this
study, only PCPs (from family or general practice,
general internal medicine, or pediatrics) were used.
Predictors
Predictors were clustered into 4 groups: (1) physi-
cian characteristics; (2) practice characteristics, in-
cluding the use of practice improvement strategies;
(3) perceived complexity of patients; and (4) physi-
cian autonomy.
Physician Characteristics
Physician variables were selected to identify sub-
groups who may report differences in satisfaction
and included gender; race (white versus nonwhite);
salaried (yes/no); specialty (family/general practice,
general internal medicine, pediatrics); began prac-
tice after 1975 (yes/no) (a proxy for physician age);
and the importance of autonomy expectations (very
important vs less than very important). Race was
only assessed in the 1997 to 1998 and 2000 to 2001
surveys; importance of control of decisions was
only assessed in the 2000 to 2001 survey.
Practice Environment
Practice environment variables were selected that
could influence perceptions and included the num-
ber of weeks the physician practiced per year, the
number of hours per week spent in direct patient
care, whether the physician had more than one
practice site (yes/no), whether the practice had
more than one physician (yes/no), whether there
were any nonphysician assistants in the practice
(yes/no), and whether the patient population in-
cluded both adults and children (yes/no). In addi-
tion, the percentages of patients with prescription
formularies and revenue from Medicaid, Medicare,
and managed care were included. Finally, the per-
ceived availability of high-quality ancillary services
(such as physical therapy, home health care, and
nutritional counseling); imaging; mental health
care; and referrals (frequently vs less than fre-
quently) were also included. The presence of non-
physician assistants and care for both adults and
children were only assessed in the 1996 to 1997 and
1998 to 1999 surveys, wheras the percentage of
patients with a prescription formulary was only
assessed in the 2000 to 2001 survey.
Practice Improvement Strategies
Variables concerning practice improvement strate-
gies designed to improve quality of care but that
may have affected perceptions included the per-
ceived effect on the practice (at least moderate vs
less than moderate effect) of computer-generated
patient data, practice guidelines, patient profiles,
reminders, patient surveys, and computer-gener-
ated treatment alternatives. The effect of computer-
generated patient data and treatment alternatives as

well as reminders was not assessed in the 2000 to
2001 survey. However, in the 2000 to 2001 survey,
7 questions were asked concerning whether infor-
mation technology (IT) was used ("no" vs "yes") to
get information about treatment alternatives and
formularies, to generate reminders, to access pa-
tient notes, to write prescriptions, to exchange clin-
ical data, and to communicate with patients. An
information technology use scale (IT Uses) was
developed consisting of the number of "yes" re-
sponses (Kuder-Richardson-20 internal consis-
tency  0.725).
Physician Perceptions
Perceived complexity of patient care was assessed.
Perceived complexity of patient care physicians felt
they were expected to provide was measured using
the question: "In general, would you say that the
complexity or severity of patients' conditions for
which you are currently expected to provide care
without referral is: much greater than it should be,
somewhat greater than it should be, about right,
somewhat less than it should be, or much less than
it should be?" This variable was dichotomized into
"much or somewhat greater complexity of care ex-
pected (yes/no)" for use in logistic regression anal-
yses.
Perceived autonomy was measured using the
statement "I have the freedom to make clinical
decisions that meet my patients' needs," with the
responses of "agree strongly," "agree somewhat,"
"disagree somewhat," "disagree strongly," and
"neither agree nor disagree." Perceived autonomy
was dichotomized into "agree strongly or some-
what that you have freedom to make clinical deci-
sions (yes/no)."
Outcome
Career satisfaction was measured using the ques-
tion, "Thinking very generally about your satisfac-
tion with your overall career in medicine, would
you say that you are currently: very satisfied, some-
what satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatis-
fied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied." Satisfaction
was dichotomized into "very or somewhat satisfied
with your career (yes/no)."
Analysis
Data were weighted using the weights provided in
the public access file. To assess possible interaction
effects between perceived complexity of care and
perceived autonomy of the predicted probability of
career satisfaction, 2-way analysis of variance was
conducted. To identify the relative contributions of
physician characteristics, practice characteristics,
improvement strategies, and physician perceptions,
staged logistic regression analysis was performed
for career satisfaction for each survey. Model 1
consisted of physician characteristics only and
model 2 consisted of physician and practice char-
acteristics. Model 3 included practice improvement
strategies in addition to the physician and practice
characteristics. In model 4, the perceived complex-
ity of care and perceived autonomy variables were
added to model 3. 2 statistics were used to assess
significance of each model with P  0.05 deemed
significant. Goodness-of-fit was assessed using
Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and the variance ac-
counted for was estimated using Nagelkerke ad-
justed R2.
Results
Table 1 presents the physician and practice char-
acteristics of physicians in this analysis. Physician
characteristics were similar across the surveys.
Changes in practice characteristics were primarily
limited to increases in the number of hours spent in
direct patient care and the proportion of revenue
from managed care. Overall, 24% to 27% of PCPs
felt that the perceived complexity of care they were
expected to provide was greater than it should be
and 83% to 86% felt they were free to make clinical
decisions. Approximately 80% of physicians were
very or somewhat satisfied with their careers.
Complexity-Autonomy Interaction
For all 3 panels, the adjusted probability of satis-
faction is significantly associated (P  .001) with
both perceived complexity of care and perceived
autonomy. As Figure 1 demonstrates, physicians
who report both low levels of perceived autonomy
and high levels of perceived patient complexity are
less likely to be very or somewhat satisfied with
their career in medicine after controlling for phy-
sician, practice environment, and practice improve-
ment characteristics. For example, predicted career
satisfaction rose from 55% among 2000 to 2001
physicians who reported low perceived autonomy
and high perceived patient complexity to 86%
among those reporting low perceived patient com-
plexity and high perceived autonomy.

Correlates of Career Satisfaction
In each case, practice environment characteristics
contributed the most to satisfaction, followed closely
by physician perceptions (see Tables 2, 3, and 4).
Across all 3 surveys, multiphysician practice; the abil-
ity to obtain high-quality ancillary services; lower
proportion of revenue from managed care; lower lev-
els of perceived complexity of patients; and perceived
autonomy were consistently associated with satisfac-
tion. Although relationships between predictors and
satisfaction in the 1996 to 1997 and 2000 to 2001
surveys changed little, the results for the 1998 to 1999
survey included significant associations that were not
significant previously, including physician character-
istics (race [, 0.17; P  .044]; internal medicine [,
0.78; P  .037]; family practice [, 0.78; P  .036],
and pediatrics [, 1.30; P  .001]); practice charac-
teristics (ability to obtain high quality imaging [,
0.41; P  .010]); and practice improvement strategies
(computer-generated treatment alternatives [, 0.16;
P  .038]).
Discussion
Although results of the Community Tracking Survey
concerning career satisfaction have been reported
previously,21,22 this analysis is the first to look at the
relationships among perceived complexity of care,
perceived autonomy, and career satisfaction. In addi-
tion to their independent contributions, perceived
complexity of care and perceived autonomy signifi-
cantly interacted to affect the probability of satisfac-
tion. Our analysis found that only multiphysician
practice, the ability to obtain high-quality ancillary
services, managed care revenue, levels of perceived
complexity of patients, and perceived autonomy was
consistently associated with satisfaction.
Career Satisfaction
Overall, approximately 80% of PCPs expressed satis-
faction. This is similar to the results of Baker et al23
among health management organization physicians.
None of the analyses in this study found a relationship
between satisfaction and physician race, gender, or
salary status. This differs from previous studies that
found associations with minority status,23 gen-
der,7,9,23­25 and ownership,21,25 employment,25 and
income.11,21,26 Specialty was associated with satisfac-
tion in the older analyses only; Sturm22 and Gaze-
wood et al24 found significant differences across spe-
cialties. Beginning practice after 1975 (perhaps a
proxy for physician age) was an inconsistent predictor,
consistent with previous studies.9,11
Practice environment variables were more im-
portant to satisfaction. Our analyses found that
more weeks practicing per year, more hours per
week in patient care, and being in a solo practice
were significant correlates of lower satisfaction.
Previous studies have found that hours spent in
patient care,11,24 a solo practice,22 and the availabil-
ity of assistants11 were significant correlates. The
ability to obtain high-quality ancillary services was
a consistent predictor of satisfaction. Although rev-
enue from Medicare was an inconsistent predictor,
income from managed care was consistently and
inversely related to satisfaction. Previous studies
have found conflicting results concerning the rela-
tionship between managed care and satisfac-
tion,22,24 but incentives to reduce services seems to
adversely affect satisfaction.8
Practice improvement strategies were not re-
lated to satisfaction. The use of performance indi-
cators has been felt to decrease perceived autonomy
even though some physicians view them as a chal-
lenge.27 However, the perception that the level of
perceived complexity of expected care was greater
than it should be was a consistent correlate of
dissatisfaction. Although not studied previously,
Lin et al11 found that the complexity of claims was
associated with dissatisfaction among PCPs.
This study found a consistent association be-
tween perceived autonomy and career satisfaction.
Not surprisingly, this relationship has been docu-
mented previously.21,24­26,28 In fact, Baker et al23
found that perceived autonomy was the most im-
portant predictor of satisfaction among health
management organization physicians. Our study
also found considerable overlap among consistent
predictors (the ability to obtain high-quality ser-
vices, the proportion of revenue from managed
care, and the perceived complexity of care expected
greater than it should be). Previous work found that
perceived autonomy was related to financial auton-
omy,14 discipline,22 solo practice,22 and managed
care revenues,24 perhaps because of the effect of
incentives to reduce services.8 Thus, these out-
comes are related but not identical.
Implications
Although this study represents 3 cross-sectional,
and not causal, analyses, there is reason to consider
some to be cause-and-effect relationships. If so, one

implication of this analysis is that factors which
influence perceived complexity or perceived auton-
omy will probably influence satisfaction as well. In
particular, the ability to obtain high-quality ser-
vices and minimizing the proportion of revenue
from managed care are important factors in maxi-
mizing satisfaction. Second, the use of practice im-
provement strategies had a minimal effect on sat-
isfaction. Although these strategies emphasize the
conflict between providing what is best for the
illness versus the patient,29 they should have little
effect on satisfaction. Third, the perception that
physicians are expected to provide care at an inap-
propriately high level of complexity was consis-
tently negatively associated with satisfaction. This
is a concerning finding because not only is the
complexity of health care increasing,30 but this is
particularly true of primary care.31 In fact, by its
very nature, primary care is more complex than
specialty care.32 To deal with this rise in the per-
ceived complexity of expected care, the PCP must
be able to respond with flexible decision making33
and creativity.30 Generally, combined strategies are
required to deal with complex problems.34
But at a higher level, what are the implications for
keeping PCPs and attracting new physicians into pri-
mary care? Whether or not approaches such as prac-
tice improvement strategies, managed care, and the
use of incentives that limit the availability of services
will help control health care costs, perceived auton-
omy and/or perceived complexity of care being
greater than should be are clearly associated with
career satisfaction. This is very relevant to the grow-
ing crisis of our inability to recruit and keep physi-
cians in primary care. The interaction between low
perceived autonomy and high perceived complexity
of care creates a situation in which physicians feel they
have a lot of responsibility but little authority; it is
little wonder that satisfaction would be adversely af-
fected. Yet, the Future of Family Medicine Project
has emphasized the need to enhance the attractive-
ness of family medicine through recognition, resolu-
tion of the tension between the need for increased
office visits and the provision of quality care, and
addressing the challenges posed by managed care.35
These issues will inevitably affect the quality and
attractiveness of primary care. In addition, because
the practice environment of chronic care is unlikely to
change, we need to consider ways to better prepare
physicians in training to cope with this high-complex-
ity, low-autonomy reality. Through the establish-
ment of realistic expectations and improved training
in dealing with the realities of practice, physicians
may alter their definitions of high-complexity care.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study. First, the
perceived complexity variables used deal with percep-
tions of complexity of care; the actual complexity of
care was not assessed. In addition, because "complex-
ity is greater than it should be" implies a negative
assessment, its relationship to career satisfaction is
somewhat circular. Second, the 1996 to 1997 regres-
sions had poor goodness-of-fit statistics, raising con-
cern about the validity of their results. Third, the
predictors of career satisfaction accounted for 15%
of the variance. In fact, for both outcomes, the pre-
dictors could not explain most of the variance; there is
much more involved in satisfaction and perceived
autonomy than what was measured. Fourth, compar-
ing the regressions across surveys is concerning. Not
only were different groups of physicians participating
in each survey, but some predictors were not assessed
in all 3 surveys. The exclusion of results from the
2004 to 2005 survey limits the timeliness of the data.
The 2004 to 2005 Community Tracking Survey
found that almost 84% expressed satisfaction (http://
ctsonline.S-3.com/psurvey.asp). Thus, the level of
satisfaction among PCPs may be increasing.
Conclusion
There was considerable interaction among per-
ceived complexity of care, perceived autonomy, and
career satisfaction and consistent predictors were
identified. Practice variables as well as perceived
complexity and perceived autonomy accounted for
most of the variance in career satisfaction. If the
shortage of PCPs is to be addressed, we must re-
solve issues surrounding the availability of services,
the challenges of managed care, the impact of prac-
tice improvement strategies, and the perceived
complexity of expected care.
