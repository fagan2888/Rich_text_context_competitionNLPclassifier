Introduction
A serious golf conversation today would not be complete
without the mention of Tiger Woods. Tiger has won 71 tour-
naments through 2009, 14 of which were major champion-
ships. Over the past decade, Tiger Woods has emerged as
one of the most recognized professional athletes of all time.
This is no small feat as the game of golf has not always been
synonymous with members of minority populations. Instead,
the game was viewed by many as an exclusive and elitist
pastime, enjoyed primarily by affluent White males who
possess the physical, social, and economic traits and attri-
butes required to access golfing facilities. Hence, it is no
wonder that, during the early days of golf as an organized
American professional sport, minority groups such as
African Americans and females were systematically
excluded or denied active and direct participation. This was
because of the fact that the game of golf is a club-driven
sport. Membership and access to clubs were contingent on
the selection process. Sadly, other American professional
sports such as baseball, basketball, and football also enforced
selective participation restrictions, limiting minority partici-
pation during the early years of inception.
During the late 1950s and early 1960s, societal pressures
combined with civil rights activities had profound effects on
American professional sports. Desegregation in professional
sport commenced, creating opportunities for minorities to
participate equally, halfheartedly, or as "tokens of jest." An
early example of such change took place at the 1963 San
Diego Open. The Professional Golfers Association of
America (PGA) finally allowed the first African American to
compete in a PGA tour event, not for his ability but as a
sponsor exemption. The golfer was world heavy-weight
champion Joe Lewis. This token of jest was perceived as
demeaning, yet it provided a pathway for future African
Americans to participate in professional golf tournaments.
Others included Charlie Sifford and Pete Brown. Sifford
won two tour events, one senior event, and was the first
African American to be inducted in the World Golf Hall of
Fame, in 2004 (PGA, 2009b). Brown became the first
African American to win a PGA-sanctioned event, the 1964
Waco Turner Open. These trailblazers have afforded the
opportunity for people of all races and color to see golf not
as an exclusive and elitist pastime but as a game in which
playing and career opportunities abound for qualified indi-
viduals. Golf is a technical sport requiring an extensive body
of competencies before career opportunities can be fully
exploited. Acquisition of such knowledge is often cost pro-
hibitive for members of minority groups, which subsequently
excludes minorities from active participation and career
exploration. However, in recent years, initiatives geared spe-
cifically toward increasing minority participation have been
developed and implemented. One such initiative was under-
taken in 2008 with the University of Maryland, Eastern
Shore (UMES). The PGA granted UMES the right to offer
the coveted "Golf Management University Program" as one
of its on-campus academic programs. The UMES is a histori-
cally Black college. This PGA initiative with UMES repre-
sented a profound departure from past practices. UMES
welcomed the inaugural class of aspiring PGA professionals
in the fall of 2008.

This article explores the issues of minority participation in
the game of golf with specific emphasis on African American
participation. The article continues by examining the PGAini-
tiatives geared toward increasing minority participation in the
game. The golf management university program accreditation
process is outlined with specific emphasis on the process
undertaken by UMES. The article concludes with excerpts
from an interview conducted with Dr. Ernest Boger, chairman
and associate professor of the Hotel and Management
Department, School of Business and Technology at UMES.
The interview revealed the process undertaken by UMES in
its successful quest to become one of only 20 universities in
the United States to offer the PGA Golf Management
University Program. The information provided in this article
can be valuable to universities that want to add the PGA's
accredited program to their academic curricula.
Minority Golf Participation
and Initiatives
The National Golf Foundation (NGF) provides relevant
information on every aspect of the golf industry. The most
recent study on minority golfer participation was published
by the NGF in 2003. In that year, the total number of golfers
above the age of 18 was reported at 27 million (NGF, 2009).
Of those 27 million golfers, approximately 5% were African
Americans, 4% were Asian Americans, and less than 4%
were Hispanic Americans (NGF, 2009). A more recent study
in 2008 reported total golfer participation had increased to
29 million. Unfortunately, statistics specific to minority golf
participation were not recorded, but it could be assumed that
such numbers would reveal low participation in relation to
nonminority golf participation. In an effort to increase
minority participation in the game, various programs and
associations have implemented golf-related initiatives. Two
such initiatives were established by the World Golf
Association and by the Bill Dickey Scholarship Association.
The World Golf Association established The "First Tee"
Program in 1997. The First Tee Program provides young
people between the ages of 8 to 18, from all backgrounds, an
opportunity to develop life-enhancing values through golf
and character education (The First Tee, 2009). The program's
objectives are to introduce golf to 3.5 million individuals to
the game over a 5-year period, to provide life skills experi-
ence at all its facilities, to expand the program to 140 com-
munities over the 5-year period, to establish a First Tee
chapter in all 50 states, and to develop First Tee operations in
90% of the top golf markets (The First Tee, 2009). Since its
inception, more than 3 million children from minority groups
have participated in the program.
The Bill Dickey Scholarship Association (formerly the
National Minority Junior Golf Scholarship Association) was
formally established in 1994 as a nonprofit organization.
Their goal was to assist minority college-bound students in
achieving excellence through the game of golf. The associa-
tion was the brainchild of its founder, Bill Dickey. During
the 1970s, Dickey envisioned a national organization com-
posed of individuals and golf clubs committed to affording
minorities the opportunity to participate in golf at the junior
and college levels. The overall focus of the organization was
on young minority golfers. The goal was to increase minority
participation in golf while pursuing an education through
support and financial assistance (Dickey, 2009).
The PGA of America's Golf
Management University Program
The PGA Golf Management University Program, formally
called the PGA Professional Golf Management Program, is
a 4.5-year structured educational program offered at 20 uni-
versities nationwide. The program is designed to provide
students with the knowledge and skills necessary for success
in the golf industry. The program includes classroom stud-
ies, internship experiences, and player development (PGA,
2009a). Ferris State University became the first PGA-
accredited program in 1975. Today, there are 20 PGA-
accredited university programs. Table 1 depicts the school,
the academic unit in which the golf management program is
located, and their respective maximum handicap entrance
requirement. Students graduating from accredited universi-
ties receive a baccalaureate degree on completion of the
institution's academic requirements, the PGA's internship
requirements, and the playing ability test (PAT) mandates.
Each graduate becomes a PGA professional on completion
of their respective baccalaureate degree. Graduates typically
gain employment as golf-teaching professionals, tournament
directors, pro shop managers, or golf sales representatives.
Graduates also gain employment in golf retail, media, mar-
keting, or with golf associations.
The UMES PGA Golf Management
University Program and Interview
The PGA Golf Management University Program is open to all
university-bound students nationwide. The program at UMES
has special significance as it coincides with the PGA's effort
to increase golf participation and golf career opportunities for
minorities. Both the university and the PGA felt that they
could develop a symbiotic relationship and achieve their
respective goals of offering the PGA golf management pro-
gram at a historically and predominantly Black college. The
accreditation process was initiated in 2002 with full accredita-
tion awarded in 2008. The authors were granted a telephone
interview with Dr. Boger in January 2009. The goal was to
gain insight into UMES's successful quest in becoming 1 of
only 20 universities selected nationwide to acquire the PGA
accreditation and to also be the first predominantly African
American university with such distinction.
Dr. Ernest Boger, chairman and associate professor of the
Hotel and Management Department, School of Business and
Technology at the UMES, was in his first 30 days at UMES
when the university decided to formally pursue the PGA
Fjelstul et al. 3
Golf Management University Program. The following are
excerpts from the interview with Dr. Boger.
How Did the Pursuit of the PGA
Accreditation Begin?
The UMES is a land grant, historically Black college located
in the small town of Princess Anne on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland. In 2002, Dr. Thelma B. Thompson, President of
UMES, wanted the university to become involved with the
golf industry. The university contacted the PGA and was sub-
sequently provided a list of the accreditation requirements to
the university. On review of the university requirements, our
president decided that UMES would be proactive and develop
a framework that would allow us to exceed the PGA require-
ments. By 2004, the UMES Golf Academy opened, offering
the only year-round, indoor golf training facility in the state of
Maryland with computer-assisted golf swing analysis equip-
ment and the short game Putt, Pitch, and Chip Center. The
UMES Golf Academy became a unique offering among the
35 golf courses located on the Eastern Shore. The PGA was
informed of the UMES Golf Academy and of UMES's com-
mitment to golf education. The PGA began informal discus-
sions with President Thompson about the PGA's Golf
Management University Program.
WhatWas theTimeline for Receiving the
Accreditation of the PGA Golf Management
University Program?
From start to finish, the accreditation process lasted 3 years.
After our informal discussions with the PGA, our administra-
tors were given a list of requirements that had to be met prior
to formal consideration by the PGA. Within 4 to 5 months, all
requirements had been met, and a formal proposal was sent to
the PGA. The goal of UMES was to exceed the expectations
set forth by the PGA. By all accounts, they did. The specific
requirements were to secure full-time positions for an incom-
ing director of the program and for an internship coordinator,
and a PGA golf professional to be employed in one of the
positions. An administrative assistant position specific to the
PGA program was also secured, an additional requirement for
each university. The facility requirements were to designate
an office area for the program, secure golf course and practice
area access for students in the program, and have access to a
learning laboratory, including a model pro shop, club fitting,
and club repair facilities. PGA representatives conducted a
site visit and were satisfied that all requirements were met.
The UMES became the 20th university in the country to
receive accreditation of the PGAGolf Management University
Program. UMES also became the first historically Black col-
lege or university to receive the PGA accreditation. The first
class of PGA golf management students arrived on the UMES
campus for the Fall 2008 semester.
DidYou Hire Personnel Directly Responsible
for the PGA Golf Management University
Program at UMES?
Yes, this had the full support from the university's president.
The PGA requires three positions dedicated to each accredited
program. The PGA requires a director to be in place
1 year prior to the inaugural class of students. A full-time
faculty member was hired at UMES to fill that role. The PGA
also requires an internship coordinator to be in place 6 months
prior to the start of the program. The internship coordinator
must be a graduate of a PGA professional golf management
program. Hence, an internship coordinator was hired by
UMES, thereby meeting all the requirements of the PGA.
Finally, an administrative assistant was hired, completing the
personnel requirements mandated by the PGA. In addition,
the PGA requires that all personnel affiliated with a university
program must attend a PGA Expo Show prior to the com-
mencement of the program. This, too, was completed.

What Department and/or College Is the
Program Housed Under andWhat Degree
WillYour Students Receive on Completion of
the PGA's Academic Program?
The PGA Golf Management University Program is housed
in the School of Business and Technology. The students will
receive a Bachelor of Science in Golf Management on
completion of the program. The program is a comprehensive
degree program, integrating the curriculum requirements of
a hotel and restaurant management major with the knowl-
edge base of the PGA's professional golf management pro-
gram, including 16 months of structured internship
experience and a PAT. The PAT is mandated by the PGA.
WereThere Any Issues or Concerns From the
UniversityWhen Developing the Curriculum
Requirements Mandated From the PGA?
The university has set policies in regard to proposing a new
degree program and curriculum. The process starts with
approval by the faculty and concludes with approval by the
state of Maryland. We did run into a small issue, but it was
resolved. Our goal was to offer a Bachelor of Science in
Golf Management, but our curriculum proposal totaled 130
credit hours, 10 more than the customary 120 credit hours.
UMES was required to make a special request to the state of
Maryland to acquire a 130 credit-hour degree program,
which was successfully awarded.
What Is/Are the Enrollment Criteria Specific
to the Golf Management Program at UMES?
A student must verify a handicap of 12 or less to be consid-
ered as an incoming student in the golf management pro-
gram at UMES. This is in addition to the regular academic
requirements for enrollment consideration. The PGA also
requires a player development program to be in place for
students who either do not have a documented 12 handicap
or less, or for those students who are having trouble passing
the mandated PAT. The player development program at
UMES is devoted to PAT preparation, offering strategies in
full swing, short game, and game management. The player
development program is designed to prepare students to suc-
cessfully pass the PAT as early in the program as possible.
The program is offered with both classroom instruction and
coordinated practice and playing, and is conducted by a
PGA member of the golf management staff. Once a student
has passed the PAT, they will no longer be required to par-
ticipate in the player development program. For those stu-
dents who do not pass the PAT by their sophomore year,
UMES offers an academic safety net. The curriculum is set
up so that a student can transition toward a degree pursuit in
hotel and restaurant management if it becomes clear that the
PAT requirement may not be successfully completed.
What IsYour FirstYear's Enrollment and
What AreYour Enrollment Goals?
The goal for the 1st year was 25 students. We have 20 stu-
dents. The demographic profile of the inaugural class is as
follows: 5 African Americans, 1 Korean, and 14 White.
Currently, there are no women enrolled in the UMES golf
management program. Eight of the students are on academic
scholarships. Our goal is to have 100 students in the PGA
program, which means that we have to add 25 students each
year. UMES is committed to enrolling a talented student
body from a variety of ethnic and geographic backgrounds.
The program is dedicated to supporting the PGA's objective
of recruiting qualified minorities into each of its accredited
university programs. To help each accredited university with
minority recruitment, the PGA provides scholarship monies
each year. PGA diversity scholarship assistance is available
for African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and
females on a competitive basis. UMES will recruit nation-
ally for prospective students.
DoYou Have ConcernsThat the Golf Industry
Is Not Growing Fast Enough to Absorb
Graduates?
No major concerns. The PGA guarantees employment for all
students graduating from a PGA-accredited university pro-
gram. UMES is happy that their students will all graduate
with PGA accreditation, status, and membership.
WhatTypes of Employment Opportunities
Are AssociatedWith PGA Accreditation?
There are many directions a graduate may take on receiving
membership in the PGA. Common pursuits include posi-
tions in pro shop operations, golf course operations,
and teaching the game of golf. There are also positions
beyond the golf course. Graduates may seek employment in
corporate and association management, manufacturing,
sales, marketing, golf technology, course and club house
design and development, research and development, mer-
chandising, tournament operations, and public relations.
What Facilities Are Available for UMES
Students Pursuing the Bachelor of Science in
Golf Management?
We are privileged to have Great Hope Golf Course and
Nutters Crossing Golf Course as the official home courses
Fjelstul et al. 5
for the UMES program. Great Hope and Nutters Crossing
will be home to many of our golf management tournaments
and will be used as learning laboratories for many of our
work experience activities. In addition, a model "golf shop"
is provided as a learning laboratory at Nutters Crossing Golf
Course. The program will use the Nutters Crossing Golf
Course in many of our work experience activities and incor-
porate budgeting, procurement, merchandising, and opera-
tions procedures.
CanYou Offer Advice for Other Academic
Programs inTheir Pursuit of the PGA's
Accredited Golf Management University
Program?
Absolutely. We had full support of this pursuit from the
President of UMES. Such support was instrumental in the
accreditation process. We also sought not only to meet
requirements set forth for PGA-accredited programs but to
exceed such expectations. We wanted the PGA to know that
we were 100% committed to securing accreditation.
Conclusion
Historically, the game of golf as a professional sport system-
atically excluded minority participation. However, in recent
years, several organizations have attempted to increase
minority participation through targeted initiatives. One such
initiative is the PGA's Golf Management University Program
geared at preparing individuals for careers in the golf indus-
try. UMES provides an excellent example of how the pro-
gram was implemented at a historically and predominantly
Black college. The university was successful in obtaining
the coveted accreditation due to several reasons.
First and foremost was full institution support. The accred-
itation solicitation process was spearheaded by the universi-
ty's president who proactively provided the necessary
resources that would support the application process. This
commitment caught the attention of PGA officials. UMES
went a step further by exceeding PGA expectations, once the
application process for the program was underway. As a
result, they completed the formal application process in 4 to 5
months. Many institutions undergo an application process of
more than 1 year. This short time frame underscores the
notion that support of the university president and the state of
Maryland was crucial in the program development process at
UMES. It also suggests that the PGA is supportive in expos-
ing minority groups to career opportunities in the game of
golf. UMES's successful quest in acquiring the golf manage-
ment accreditation also highlights the need for partnership
between academic institutions and the golf community; that
is, the UMES partnership with several area golf courses for
the practical PGA requirements. Finally, increasing minority
participation in golf requires initiatives and organizations
designed to expose members of minority populations to golf
at an early age. Examples of such organizations include the
First Tee and the Bill Dickey Scholarship Foundation. The
combination of early exposure, scholarships, and structured
educational programs should increase minority participation
in the game of golf in the foreseeable future. It will be inter-
esting to see whether other historically Black colleges and
universities pursue the PGA Golf Management University
Program. It will also be interesting to examine demographic
composition of these programs to see whether members of
minority groups are taking advantages of these golf educa-
tional opportunities.
