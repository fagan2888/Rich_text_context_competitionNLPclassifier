Background: Few studies examining the genetic architecture of cigarette smoking have focused on ado-
lescents or examined developmental changes in additive genetic, shared environment, and unique envi-
ronmental influences on liability to initiate cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked. The aim
of this study was to add to the literature on liability to initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using
a nationally representative sample. Method: Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult
twin pairs (aged 14­33 years) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We
ran a series of developmental causal­contingent­common pathway models to examine whether additive
genetic, shared, and unique environmental influences on liability to the initiation of cigarette use are shared
with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results: We
found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette
use. Early in adolescence, genetic and environmental influences work independently on liability to cigarette
smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but liability to these behaviors becomes correlated
as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the causal pro-
cesses underlying the liability to smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and
environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked.

play a role in smoking initiation (Li et al., 2003; Sullivan &
Kendler, 1999), but primarily additive and unique environ-

shown that additive genetic factors influence age at smoking
initiation, but a different set of genetic factors contribute to
the number of cigarettes smoked (Broms et al., 2006).
Work with adolescent and young adult twins has sug-
gested that smoking initiation is primarily influenced by
shared environmental factors early in adolescence (Dick
et al., 2006; Unger et al., 2011), although some studies do
suggest that additive genetic effects play a role in having ever
smoked a cigarette (Huizink et al., 2010; Kendler et al., 1993;
Maes et al., 1999). As adolescents reach late adolescence and
young adulthood, additive genetic factors become increas-
ingly more important (Kendler et al., 2008; Koopmans et al.,
1997; Maes & Neale, 2009; Maes et al., 2004).
Due to the conditional nature of drug use (Kendler et al.,
1999b), properly estimating the heritability of smoking
quantity requires employing a conditional model that takes
into account the heritability of cigarette smoking initiation.
The appropriate method to examine additive genetic and
shared environmental factors to liability of drug use quan-
tity is a causal­contingent­common (CCC) pathway model
(Kendleretal.,1999a)thatallowsfortheconcurrentestima-
tion of quantity conditional on drug use initiation as well
as for estimating the relationship between drug use initia-
tion and drug use quantity (see Figure 1). The CCC model
estimates separate liabilities for drug use initiation and for
quantity of drug use given initiation. Once adolescents ini-
tiate smoking, previous studies have found that heaviness of
smoking (light, moderate, or heavy cigarette use; Huizink
et al., 2010; Koopmans et al., 1999) and the presence of
nicotine dependence as measured by the Fagerstrom Test
for Nicotine Dependence (Haberstick et al., 2007; Heather-
ton et al., 1991; Vink et al., 2005) are influenced by genetic
factors, butno significantshared environmental effects have
been reported. In a study of 11- to 19-year-old twins, the
sameadditivegeneticandsharedenvironmentalfactorsthat
influenced initiation of cigarette use were found to con-
tribute to the variance in the number of cigarettes smoked
(Fowler et al., 2007). The present study extends previous
research in this area (Do et al., 2015; ¨
Oncel et al., 2014) by
characterizing in greater detail the developmental changes
in the heritability of the quantity of cigarettes smoked per
day conditional on cigarette use initiation across different
age groups spanning adolescence and young adulthood and
testing for age-specific sex differences among twins from a
nationally representative US sample.
Material and Methods
Sample
Data for this study came from twin pairs available in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health; Harris et al., 2006, 2013). The Add Health
study recruited adolescent participants when they were
enrolled in high school and subsequently assessed them
through three in-home interviews, for four waves of longi-
tudinal data. In the first wave, participants' age ranged from
12 to 17 years and in the last wave, participants ranged in
age from 28 to 33 years. At each wave of the four-wave
longitudinal study, participants reported on whether they
had ever smoked a cigarette, and if they indicated they had
smoked, they were subsequently asked how many cigarettes
they had smoked per day in the previous 30 days.
Zygosityofthetwinpairswasdeterminedbymatchingon
12 molecular genetic markers and through self-report ques-
tionsregardingthetwins'similarity(Harrisetal.,2006).For
this study, participants were divided into five groups based
on sex and zygosity (monozygotic males (MZM), monozy-
gotic females (MZF), dizygotic males (DZM), dizygotic fe-
males (DZF), and opposite sex dizygotic twins (DZO) so
that we could test for qualitative and quantitative sex differ-
encesinthesourcesofgeneticandenvironmentalinfluences
on the phenotypes.
In the Add Health study, data were available for 740
twin pairs aged 12 to 33 years. At younger ages (12 and 13
years), the prevalence of smoking was very low and no par-
ticipants smoked more than 11 cigarettes per day, so data
for this age group was not used. Beginning with age 14,
we collapsed across ages resulting in having an age group
of adolescent twins who were between 14 and 15 years
of age (n = 571 individuals), a group of 16- to 17-year-

tion, the prevalence of having ever smoked a cigarette, and
the percentage of individuals in each of the three categories
of cigarette smoking quantity for each age group. Tetra-
choric and polychoric correlations for cigarette smoking
initiation and cigarette smoking quantity are available in
Tables 2 and 3 respectively.
Measures
The aim of this study was to examine developmental
changes in the etiology of smoking cigarettes, so cigarette
smoking initiation and cigarette smoking quantity variables
were created for each available age in the Add Health data.
The smoking initiation variable was coded 1 when partic-
ipants responded yes, or 0 when the answer was no to the
survey question: `Have you ever smoked a cigarette?' Sub-
sequently, those participants who answered yes to having
initiated smoking were asked how many cigarettes they had
smoked in the previous 30 days. The answer to this question
was used to create the smoking quantity variable. In Wave 3
of the Add Health data, the options available to participants
to respond to the question about how many cigarettes they
had smoked in the previous 30 days were ordinal categories
rather than open-ended, as in waves 1, 2, and 4. Therefore,
the quantity smoked variable used in the present analyses
was an ordered categorical variable such that `0' referred to
not having smoked any cigarettes in the previous 30 days,
`1' referred to smoking between 1 and 11 cigarettes per day,
and `2' indicated smoking more than 11 cigarettes per day.
Further, those participants who reported not having ever
smoked a cigarette (the never smokers) were coded as hav-
ing missing information for the smoking quantity variable
as has been suggested by Neale and colleagues (2006).

in a phenotype and take advantage of the differences in the
proportion of segregating genes between pairs of monozy-
gotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins who are reared to-
gether. MZ twins share 100% of their segregating genes,
while DZ twins share on average 50% of their genes. If
genetic factors contribute to a phenotype then MZ twins
would be expected to be more similar than DZ twins. The
variance in a phenotype is partitioned into additive genetic
(A), shared environmental (C), or unique environmental
(E) sources, where additive genetic sources of variance in-
volve the cumulative effects of individual genes on a phe-
notype. Shared environmental sources are aspects of the
environment that both twins experience and increase their
similarity. Non-shared environmental sources of variance
are aspects of the environment that contribute to making
twinsdifferentinthesamefamily.Measurementerrorisalso
contained in the non-shared environmental component.
The first step in data analysis involved testing the as-
sumptions that the thresholds for cigarette smoking initia-
tion were equal across twin order, sex, and zygosity for each
age group. Then univariate analyses for binary variables de-
composed the variance of cigarette smoking initiation into
additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and unique
environmental (E) sources and tested sex differences. Two
types of sex differences were tested for: differences in the
magnitude of genetic effects between males and females
(quantitative sex differences) as well as differences due to
a different set of genes influencing the phenotype in males
than in females (qualitative sex differences). Quantitative
and qualitative sex differences in cigarette smoking initia-
tion were tested by comparing the likelihood statistic (-2LL)
produced by reduced models with the likelihood of the full
model. The difference in likelihood between the two models
is known as the likelihood ratio test and is asymptotically
distributed as 2.
Causal­contingent­common analyses. Age-specific CCC
models (Kendler et al., 1999a; Maes et al., 2004) for or-
dered categorical variables were run, starting with a full,
sex-specific model where the three sources (A, C, E) of vari-
ance were included for both cigarette smoking initiation
and cigarette quantity smoked, and included a common
pathway between initiation and quantity (Model 1). First,
an overall test for sex differences was performed (Model
2), followed by an overall test for the significance of ge-
netic factors for both smoking initiation (ai in Figure 1)
and smoking quantity (aq in Figure 1) at once (Model 3),
and shared environmental contributions to smoking initia-
tion and smoking quantity simultaneously (Model 4). The
significance of the common pathway between smoking ini-
tiation and quantity smoked (b in Figure 1) was tested at
each age group (Model 5). A common pathway coefficient
of 0 would indicate that smoking initiation and quantity
smoked are independent processes for that particular age
group, while a common pathway coefficient of 1 would in-
dicate that smoking quantity is on the same continuum
as smoking initiation. The statistical significance of the
variance components for smoking initiation (ai and ci in
Figure 1) and for smoking quantity (aq and cq in Figure 1)
was tested separately by fixing each to zero and examining
model fit (Models 6­9). Analyses were done in R (RCore,
2012) using the OpenMx package (Boker et al., 2011).
Results
Prevalence of lifetime cigarette use by age group is presented
in Table 1. The prevalence rates for this sample are in line
with the national estimates available for the years during
which the survey was carried out (Johnston et al., 2013).
Slightly over half of the 14- to 15-year olds, 70% of the 16- to
17-year olds, and over three-quarters of both the 18- to 25-
yearoldsand26-to33-yearoldshadeversmokedacigarette.
Of the 14- to 15-year olds who had ever smoked, 29.6%
were light smokers, and 6.2% were heavy smokers. The
proportion of heavy smokers was highest in the 16- to 17-
year olds (14.1%) and lowest in the 26- to 33-year old group
(8.7%). Table 1 presents the prevalence of lifetime cigarette
use and quantity of cigarettes smoked by sex and zygosity.
Age-Specific Univariate Models of Smoking Initiation
For each age group, we first fitted a saturated model, where
the thresholds and correlations for cigarette smoking initi-
ation were allowed to vary by twin order, sex, and zygosity.
Then twin model assumptions were tested by evaluating
changes in model fit when the thresholds were constrained
across twin order, zygosity, same- and opposite-sex twins,
and for males and females (results available upon request).
Thresholds could be equated across twin order, zygosity
(except at young adulthood), same- and opposite sex, and
males and females (except in the oldest age group). Next,
whether different genetic factors or environmental influ-
ences in males and females contribute to the variance in
cigarette smoking initiation (qualitative sex differences), as
well as whether males and females differed in the magni-
tudeofadditivegeneticeffects(quantitativesexdifferences),
were tested for at each age group. There was no evidence of
qualitative or quantitative sex differences in cigarette smok-
ing initiation at any of the age groups (results available upon
request).
Age-Specific Causal­Contingent­Common Pathway
Models
For the 14- to 15-year-old group, the full CCC path-
way model allowed the loadings of variance components
for cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes
smoked to be freely estimated across sexes (Table 4, Model
1). Constraining the parameters to be equal across sexes did
not cause the fit of the model to deteriorate (Model 2: 2 =
7.52, df = 9, p = .583, see Table 3). Next, we tested the over-
all significance of the shared environment or the genetic

the liabilities to cigarette quantity are independent of one another, then the twin correlations
for cigarette quantity will accurately reflect the findings from the causal-contingent-common

quantity and found that the common pathway in this age
group was not significant (Model 5: 2 = 2.54, df = 1,
p = .111). Subsequent models for this age group did not
include the common pathway between smoking initiation
and smoking quantity. We then tested the significance of the
additive genetic contribution to smoking initiation (Model
6) and smoking quantity (Model 7) and that of the shared
environment on smoking initiation (Model 8) and smok-
ing quantity (Model 9). We found that additive genetic and

shared environmental influences were significant for smok-

Model 8: 2 = 6.15, df = 1, p = .013) but not for smoking

9: 2 = 0.34, df = 1, p = .56).
For the 16- to 17-year-old group, constraining the
variance components and the common pathway between

to be equal across males and females did not worsen model
fit (2 = 7.50, df = 9, p = .585). Removing the effects of the
shared environment (Model 3: 2 = 7.32, df = 2, p = .026)
caused a significant reduction in the fit of the model but not
when additive genetic effects were removed (Model 4: 2 =
5.51, df = 2, p = .063). The significance of the common
pathway between cigarette smoking initiation and quan-
tity of cigarettes smoked was tested by setting it to zero and
resulted in worse model fit (Model 5: 2 = 19.84, df = 1, p <
.0001), suggesting that for the 16- to 17-year-old group, the
liabilities to smoking initiation and smoking quantity were
correlated. Dropping either additive genetic effects from
smoking initiation (Model 6: 2 = 5.29, df = 1, p = .021) or
shared environmental contributions to smoking initiation
(Model 8: 2 = 6.21, df = 1, p = .013) worsened the fit of
the model, but removing the influence of additive genetic
effects (Model 7: 2 = 1.25, df = 1, p = .264) or shared
environmental influences from smoking quantity (Model
9: 2 = 0.78, df = 1, p = .379) did not.
For the 18- to 25-year olds, testing a model where the
estimates in the parameters were equated across males and
females resulted in no significant reduction in model fit
(Model 2: 2 = 13.27, df = 9, p = .151), so the sub-
sequent models contained equal A, C, and E estimates
and the common pathway across sex. Next, a model that
tested the overall contribution of the shared environment
was not significant (Model 3: 2 = 0.0, df = 2, p =
1.0), but that of additive genetic effects was significant
(Model 4: 2 = 38.42, df = 2, p < .001). Next, whether
the liabilities to smoking initiation and smoking quan-
tity were independent of one another was tested by re-
moving the common pathway from the model and re-
sulted in a worse fit (Model 5: 2 = 8.87, df = 1, p
< .01). In subsequent models for this age group, the
common pathway was included. The specific influence of
additive genetic effects was found to be important for
smoking initiation (Model 6: 2 = 534.23, df = 1, p
< .001) but not for smoking quantity (Model 7: 2 =
2.62, df = 1, p = .106). The influence of the shared en-
vironment did not deteriorate model fit on liability to
smoking initiation (Model 8: 2 = 0.0, df = 1, p =
1.0), or smoking quantity (Model 9: 2 = 0.0, df = 1,
p = 1.0).
Lastly, for the 26- to 33-year-old age group, equating
the estimates across sex did not result in worse model fit
(Model 2: 2 = 11.1, df = 9, p = .269), suggesting that for
this age group there were no significant differences by sex
in the estimates for A, C, and E or in the beta coefficient
of the common pathway. Removing the overall influence of
the shared environment did not cause a reduction in model
fit (Model 3: 2 = 0.0, df = 2, p = 1.0), but the removal
of additive genetic influences did cause the model to fit
worse (Model 4: 2 = 276.18, df = 2, p < .001). When the
common pathway between smoking initiation and smoking
quantity was removed in Model 5, the model fit worsened
(2 = 10.53, df = 1, p < .01), suggesting that the liabilities
to smoking initiation and smoking quantity are correlated
at this age. Additive genetic influences were important for
smoking initiation (Model 6: 2 = 460.24, df = 1, p <
.001) but not for smoking quantity (Model 7: 2 = 3.06,
df = 1, p = .08). The influence of shared environment was
not significant for smoking initiation or smoking quantity
(Model 8: 2 = 0.0, df = 1, p = 1.0; Model 9: 2 = 0.0, df =
1, p = 1.0).
The variance component estimates and associated 95%
confidence intervals (CI) from the CCC pathway model
without sex differences are presented in Table 5 for each age
group. The influence of risk factors for quantity of cigarettes
smoked that exert their influence through their effect on
smoking initiation was found to increase through adoles-
cence and into young adulthood. For the 14- to 15-year-old
age group, we found that risk factors influencing smoking
initiation were independent of those that contributed to
smoking quantity. In the three older age groups, the risk
factors predisposing to smoking initiation were correlated
with those that influence smoking quantity (98%, 62%, and
65%, respectively) suggesting substantial overlap in the fac-
tors that influence initiating cigarette use and the number
of cigarettes smoked among older adolescents and young
adults.
We present estimates of the variance components for the
same model across all age groups (Table 5), even though
the causal path was not significant for age group 14­15 and
some of the genetic and shared environmental contribu-
tions were not significant. We estimated that for the 14- to
15-year-old age group, 42% of the variance in liability to
smoking initiation was accounted for by additive genetic
factors, 46% by shared environmental factors, and 12% by
non-shared environmental factors. Only non-shared envi-
ronmental factors accounted for a significant portion of
the variance (63%) in quantity of cigarettes smoked. In
the 16- to 17-year-olds, 43% of the variance in liability to
smoking initiation was accounted for by additive genetic
factors, 10% was attributable to the shared environment,
and 26% by non-shared environment. The additive genetic
and shared environmental influences on smoking initia-
tion were found to be almost completely shared with those
that influence smoking quantity (causal path estimated at
0.93) but no additional genetic effects or shared environ-
mental effects were found for this age group to influence
the quantity of cigarettes smoked. The estimates for the
18- to 25-year-old and the 26- to 33-year-old age groups

indicated that only additive genetic factors accounted for
familial resemblance in liability to smoking initiation (84%
and 87% respectively), and that these factors influenced
smoking quantity through a substantial common path. Ad-
ditional genetic effects were found to influence the quantity
of cigarettes smoked for both young adult age groups (about
30% each).
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to examine developmental
changes in the etiology of smoking behavior by modeling
the influence of additive genetic and shared environmen-
tal influences of quantity of cigarettes smoked conditional
on having initiated cigarette smoking. Consistent with pre-
vious work, the results of the present study did not find
sex differences in the proportion of variance explained by
genetic or environmental factors in adolescent smoking ini-
tiation or quantity of cigarettes smoked (Boomsma et al.,
1994; McGue et al., 2000; Rende et al., 2005).
The results indicate the presence of developmental
changes in the degree of overlap between the liability of
smoking initiation and smoking quantity from adolescence
and into young adulthood. The common pathway between
liability to cigarette smoking initiation and cigarette smok-
ing quantity could be dropped from the model in early
adolescence, suggesting that different risk factors influence
whether individuals have initiated cigarette use and how
many cigarettes they subsequently smoked. For older ado-
lescents and young adults, removing the common pathway
between liability to initiate smoking and quantity smoked
worsened model fit, suggesting the presence of correlated li-
abilities between cigarette use initiation and cigarette smok-
ing quantity, as has been found in previous adult twin stud-
ies (Boomsma et al., 1994; Maes et al., 2004). Thus, with age,
the factors that influence the initiation of smoking also play
a role in how many cigarettes individuals smoke. At ages
16­17, we found that 93% of the variance in liability to the
amount of cigarette smoked was shared with the liability to
initiate cigarette smoking. The corresponding proportions
of variance in liability of cigarette smoking quantity shared
with smoking initiation are 62% for the 18- to 25-year-old
group, and 65% for the 26- to 33-year-old group. Recent
reports of adolescent and young adult smoking have shown
similar estimates for the proportion of variance in liability
shared between smoking initiation and quantity (Do et al.,
2015; ¨
Oncel et al., 2014).
Further, the findings suggest developmental changes in
the factors that contribute to smoking initiation and num-
ber of cigarettes smoked when quantity smoked is modeled
contingent on initiation. For the youngest age group, addi-
tive genetic and shared environmental factors were found
to contribute to the liability of smoking initiation, but there
were no new additive genetic or shared environmental in-
fluences specific to the liability of smoking quantity. Pre-
vious adolescent and young adult twin studies that have
estimated the heritability of cigarettes smoked contingent
on cigarette use initiation have included twins of a broader
age range (Boomsma et al., 1994; ¨
Oncel et al., 2014) during
a time when the etiology of smoking behavior is chang-
ing rapidly. The differences in the results observed in the
present study compared with previous findings may be
due to our age-specific focus, which uncovered a develop-
mental change that may have been previously overlooked.
Consistent with our findings, recently, Do and colleagues
(2015) reported no evidence of new additive genetic ef-
fects on the quantity of cigarettes smoked in early adoles-
cence. As individuals aged into late adolescence and young
adulthood, the influence of additive genetic factors became
more important for the initiation of cigarette use, a find-
ing that is consistent with previous research (Do et al.,
2015; Kendler et al., 2012; Koopmans et al., 1997). For the
two oldest age groups (18­25 and 26­33), shared environ-
mental influences did not contribute significantly to the
liability to initiate smoking but additive genetic effects were
significant.
We show that there are changes in the overlap of addi-
tive genetic and environmental factors that play a role in
the initiation of smoking during early adolescence and into
young adulthood. This finding adds to the literature on
the developmental changes in the contributions of additive
genetic and shared environmental factors on smoking ini-
tiation (Boomsma et al., 1994; Han et al., 1999) and smok-
ing quantity and delineates the developmental shift from
shared environmental influences on smoking initiation to

It has been known that smoking behaviors are complex
behavioral traits that are under genetic and environmen-
tal influence (Kendler et al., 2012; Munafo et al., 2004).
The present study adds to a growing body of literature
(Do et al., 2015; ¨
Oncel et al., 2014) indicating that the ge-
netic and environmental risk factors for smoking behaviors
change over adolescence and into young adulthood. Efforts
to find the gene clusters associated with cigarette use have
resulted in identifying dopamine receptor genes associated
with cigarette use initiation, progression into regular use,
and nicotine dependence (Munafo et al., 2004). Further,
once individuals begin using cigarettes and are exposed to
nicotine, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes have been
found to be associated with both the number of cigarettes
smoked per day (Liu et al., 2010; Saccone et al., 2010;
Tobacco & Genetics Consortium, 2010) and nicotine de-
pendence (Chen et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014; Ware et al.,
2011). However, this work has focused almost exclusively on
adult samples. Whether the same genes are important for
younger samples has yet to be determined. Our results indi-
cate that during early adolescence, the shared environment
plays a substantial role in cigarette use, thus characterizing
how different environmental exposures interact with gene
clusters in increasing risk for initiating and maintaining
cigarette use during this age group will provide a compre-
hensive understanding of the unfolding of cigarette use.
The implications of these findings for the future gene find-
ing research suggest the need to search for genetic variants
for cigarette use initiation and quantity that are develop-
mentally specific.
Limitations
The findings of the present study should be considered with
the following limitations in mind. First, to examine devel-
opmental changes, the sample of available twins in the data
was divided into groups according to age, and this may have
reduced the power to detect significant sex effects, especially
at the youngest ages where the sample of twin pairs was
287. Second, to have a comparable quantity smoked vari-
able across each assessment, we turned a continuous mea-
sure of cigarettes smoked per day into an ordinal variable,
which may have resulted in loss of information to detect
individual differences. Lastly, recent research has indicated
important racial/ethnic differences in age of smoking on-
set (Clark et al., 2013), in quantity of cigarettes smoked
(Gutman et al., 2011), and in the development of nicotine
dependence (Duncan et al., 2012). In the present analy-
ses, we did not test for the possibility that additive genetic
influences on the liability to initiate smoking and on the
quantity of cigarettes smoked would differ by racial/ethnic
background.
