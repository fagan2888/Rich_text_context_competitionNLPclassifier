Introduction
Models of agricultural land use are often used to predict how
future landscapes will reflect farmers' responses to social,
economic, technological, or environmental change, and so
inform policy decisions. Examples include efforts to under-
stand the implications of potential incentives for greenhouse
gas mitigation on agriculture (Perez & Muller-Holm, 2001)
and in predicting the effects of agricultural policy on biodi-
versity (Pacini,Wossink, Geisen, & Huirne, 2004;Watkinson,
Freckleton, Robinson, & Sutherland, 2000).
Central to most land-use models are assumptions about
the behavior of farmers and, in particular, about the decision-
making process adopted when choosing crops. In the vast
majority of models (including the one described here), farm-
ers are assumed to act so as to optimize a utility function.
When constructing this utility function, modelers must make
decisions about which aspects of farmer behavior to include,
and which to exclude, as well as how parameters will be esti-
mated and how the utility function itself will be solved.
Models that attempt to predict the effects of policy changes
are often constructed using the technique of mathematical

Abstract
Developing models to predict the effects of social and economic change on agricultural landscapes is an important challenge.
Model development often involves making decisions about which aspects of the system require detailed description and
which are reasonably insensitive to the assumptions. However, important components of the system are often left out
because parameter estimates are unavailable. In particular, measurements of the relative influence of different objectives,
such as risk, environmental management, on farmer decision making, have proven difficult to quantify. We describe a model
that can make predictions of land use on the basis of profit alone or with the inclusion of explicit additional objectives.
Importantly, our model is specifically designed to use parameter estimates for additional objectives obtained via farmer
interviews. By statistically comparing the outputs of this model with a large farm-level land-use data set, we show that
cropping patterns in the United Kingdom contain a significant contribution from farmer's preference for objectives other
than profit. In particular, we found that risk aversion had an effect on the accuracy of model predictions, whereas preference
for a particular number of crops grown was less important. While nonprofit objectives have frequently been identified as
factors in farmers' decision making, our results take this analysis further by demonstrating the relationship between these
preferences and actual cropping patterns.

programming because this accommodates legislated require-
ments and subsidies relatively easily.
Two major variants of agricultural mathematical pro-
gramming models have emerged. The oldest involves explic-
itly specifying as many aspects of the farming profit function
as possible, such as rotational constraints, timing of field
operations, diseases, and environmental runoff (see, for
example,Annetts &Audsley, 2002;Arfini, 2005; Rounsevell,
Annetts, Audsley, Mayr, & Reginster, 2003). One advantage
of this explicit modeling approach is that, because underly-
ing processes are modeled explicitly, these models should be
more robust to predicting land use in novel policy scenarios.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it is often extremely
difficult to quantify all of the required parameters in such an
explicit model, and there are inevitably aspects of the system
that are omitted. As a consequence, early explicit models
were found to have limited predictive accuracy, which led to
the development of "Positive Mathematical Programming"
(PMP; Howitt, 1995), in which a relatively simple utility
function is constructed, and a quadratic correction function is
found that exactly calibrates the model to reference data. In a
PMP model, aspects of the system that are difficult to quan-
tify get subsumed into the correction term. Although this
means that even relatively simple PMP models can appear to
have good predictive qualities, it also means that the ability
of the model to make predictions outside the circumstances
of the reference data set is limited. PMP and explicit models
therefore serve complementary functions in predictive mod-
eling, and it is important that both are pursued. In this article,
we focus on explicit models because our goal is to evaluate
the importance of particular aspects of farmer's behavior in
determining land use.
As farming is a business activity, it is not surprising that
many explicit models of farmer behavior have focused purely
on the contribution of profit to utility (Janssen & van Ittersum,
2007). There is, however, considerable qualitative evidence
that farmers also make land-use decisions in response to a
variety of nonprofit objectives such as maintaining indepen-
dence (Gasson, 1973), controlling workload (Fairweather &
Keating, 1994; Solano, Léon, Pérez, & Herrero, 2001), reduc-
ing risk (Harper & Eastman, 1980; McGregor et al., 1996;
Solano et al., 2001), and caring for the environment (Brodt,
Klonsky, & Tourte, 2006; Fairweather & Keating, 1994;
Solano et al., 2001). While these studies collectively suggest
that farmers value outcomes other than pure profit, there is
currently very little quantitative evidence to assess whether
this translates to observed behavior. To address this problem,
detailed quantitative studies are required across different
farming contexts examining the question of whether farmer's
stated preferences correlate with observed behavior.
Our goal here is to examine the importance of preferences
other than profit in determining crop composition for low-
land arable farmland in England and Wales. Specifically, we
aim to determine whether the addition of key nonprofit pref-
erences to the utility function of farmers can improve the
agreement between model outputs and empirical data. To
achieve this, we develop a method for including multiple
preferences in the utility function of farmers that is closely
tied to an interview process eliciting parameters for the
model. We then make use of a detailed and extensive data
set, the Farm Business Survey (Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs & National Assembly for Wales,
2002, 2003, 2004, 2005; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food & National Assembly for Wales, 2001), which pro-
vides information on crop yields and areas grown at the indi-
vidual farm holding level. Model performance can be
assessed based on agreement between model predictions and
the survey data. We compare the performance of a range of
models, including a purely empirical benchmark (a regres-
sion of crop gross margin against area), a pure-profit model,
and a model incorporating multiple preferences.
We begin by describing the model itself in three parts: (a)
the framework for constructing a single weighted objective
(utility) from a number of subobjectives, (b) how key prefer-
ences were identified and quantified, and (c) how these are
implemented within our model. We then describe the meth-
ods used to compare model output with empirical data.
Trading-Off Multiple Objectives:
Mathematical Framework
The core of the model is a description of individual farmer
decision making that assumes the selected decision opti-
mizes a weighted combination of all relevant objectives. We
used mixed-integer programming for this because it is suited
to the inclusion of multiple objectives and is widely used in
land-use simulation models (Arfini, 2005).Alinear or mixed-
integer programming model comprises an overall objective
function to be maximized or minimized subject to a series of
constraints (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, & Flannery, 1992).
The overall objective function is a simple sum of the follow-
ing form:
U c x
i i
i
=  .
(1)
In our model, U is overall utility and x
i
denotes the quan-
tity of various units, such as areas of crops, number of work-
ers, or number of machines. The constants, c
i
, are the amount
of utility gained or lost for a change in x
i
and include crop
gross margins, labor costs, and machinery costs. For any
given farm, there are constraints on the potential values of x
i
,
such as the amount of labor or equipment time available.
Nonlinear relationships can be incorporated through a sys-
tem of constraints and integer variables called "special
ordered sets" (Beale & Forrest, 1976). As special ordered
sets can substantially increase computation time, we mini-
mized their use by describing curved objective functions (see
below) with a small (<4) number of line segments.
Cooke et al. 3
The utility model comprises multiple objectives, such as
profit, risk, and crop complexity, each of which is a sum of
contributions from each of the quantities x
i
. This leads to a
hierarchy of sums:
U u w O
k k k
k
=  ,
(2)
O c x
k i
k
i
i
=  ,
(3)
where each of the k objectives, O
k
, is associated with two
constant factors, u
k
and w
k
. The factor, u
k
, converts the units
of objective k (e.g., profit, risk, or crop complexity) into a
common scale based on utility (see below for a description of
how each individual objective is calculated). The weighting
w
k
determines the importance of objective k relative to the
other objectives. Values are renormalized so that 
k k
w =1.
Each of the individual k objectives has an associated set of
coefficients, c
i
k determining the contribution from each x
i
to
that objective. The solution consists of a vector
X ={ , , }
x x x
n

describing the optimal land-use configura-
tion. For nonlinear relationships between U and O
k
, a special
ordered set constraint is applied, which ensures that an
appropriate value of u
k
is used according to the value of O
k
in
different segments of the curve.
The model is implemented as a package, "farmR" for the
open source statistical environment, R (R Development Core
Team, 2008). It uses the open source COIN-LP (http://www.
coin-or.org/) numerical library to solve the underlying
mixed-integer programming problem. The package, includ-
ing source code, is available from the Comprehensive R
Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
Archive/farmR).
Estimation of Preferences
Although the parameters w
k
and u
k
for each objective are
indistinguishable in mathematical terms (see Equation 2), we
distinguish between them in our framework because they are
conceptually different and must therefore be elicited
separately.
Prior to the interviews, we identified 15 farm manage-
ment objectives based on a literature review, pilot farmer
interviews, and a focus group (a complete list of objectives is
provided in Appendix A). Subsequently, detailed interviews
were conducted using a multicriteria decision analysis frame-
work (Belton & Stewart, 2002) with 47 farmers from the
eastern counties of England (Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, and
Norfolk) to elicit model parameters. The interactive soft-
ware, Logical Decisions® Version 5.129 (http://www
.logicaldecisions.com), was used to record data and allow
farmers to view their results and revise them if required.
Logical Decisions is a decision support software based on
multicriteria decision making used to implement the Analytic
Hierarchy Process (see, for example, Moffett, Dyer, & Sarkar,
2006). It was used with our farmers to interactively work
through the objective hierarchy and record data, and allowed
the farmers to instantaneously view results, provide feedback,
and modify their responses iteratively until satisfied. For each
objective, the farmers were asked to state the two objective
values at which they would experience 0% and 100% satis-
faction (utility). The farmers were then asked to identify their
satisfaction level at between 1 and 6 intermediate points,
resulting in a satisfaction curve. This process provided values
for u
k
: the slope of the relationship between utility and the kth
objective at the various positions along the curve.
Following capture of satisfaction curves, a SMART/
SWING weighting procedure was carried out (Mustajoki,
Hämäläinen, & Salo, 2005; von Winterfeldt & Edwards,
1986). The farmers were asked to state the objective that they
most wished to move from its worst (0% satisfaction) to its
best (100% satisfaction) level. This objective, which was
almost always profit, was given a score of 100 and the impor-
tance of moving every other objective, from the worst to the
best level, was scored relative to it. After completing this
process once, the results were normalized so that the sum of
all preference weights was equal to 1. Upon viewing the nor-
malized results, the farmers were given the opportunity to
revise their estimates until satisfied that the weights reflected
their preferences. This section of the interview provided a set
of weights w
k
for each objective.
Choice of Objectives and Calculation of Weights
Of the 15 objectives assessed, the most important were profit
(defined as the sum of revenues and subsidies, less variable
costs), risk minimization, free time (defined as time not
farming), and crop management complexity (defined as the
total number of crop types grown). Together, these accounted
for more than 50% of preference weights. Although free time
was listed as second most important on average, simple mod-
els of free time (based on number of free days per year) were
saturated (achieved 100% satisfaction with respect to the
objective) without any adjustments to crop choice; the objec-
tive was therefore excluded from further consideration. Our
model almost certainly does not represent free time well
because it does not include time spent on administration,
account for time saved through the use of contractors, or
include preferences for the timing with which free time is
taken. We were unable to include such a detailed free time
model in the present study because we did not have access to
detailed data on administration time or farmers' preferences
for timing of free time. By leaving this component out of our
objective function, we make the assumption that it is rela-
tively orthogonal to the other major objectives under consid-
eration. The model therefore included the three important
objectives: profit, risk minimization, and crop management
4 SAGE Open
complexity. The remaining objectives were given low
weightings; including them would have added considerable
complexity to the model.
The average relative preference weights were profit, 24%;
perceived risk, 9%; and crop management complexity, 8.5%.
When rescaled such that profit was equal to 100%, the
weights were 37% for risk and 35% for crop complexity.
Throughout the remainder of the article, we refer to objective
weightings assuming that this rescaling has been applied.
Satisfaction Curves
The satisfaction curve for each objective is the relationship
between utility (U) and the objective value. Each of the
farmers in our stated preference survey gave an individual
satisfaction curve for each objective, and we used averages
of these curves when calculating model outputs for the Farm
Business Survey farmers. This average curve was deter-
mined by fitting a spline function to the curve of each
farmer, choosing a standard set of x values, and then averag-
ing the y values at each x. To incorporate these curves into
our model, we converted each curve into between 1 and 4
linear segments (depending on the objective), giving a set of
slopes (u
k
).
The average stated profit curve (standardized to a 250-ha
farm) was a straight line between £0 (0% satisfaction) and
£120,000 (100% satisfaction). These values were elicited
from farmers using the methods described above and repre-
sent the average points at which a farmer's satisfaction would
be saturated (maximum) and fall to 0 (minimum). However,
for inclusion in the model, the values of the parameter deter-
mined from the intercept had to be adjusted to take account
of the fact that the model objective function predicts net
gross margin (defined as the sum of crop gross margins
minus labor and machinery costs) and not profit. This differ-
ence is because various fixed costs, such as rent, insurance,
building repairs, and administrative costs, are excluded. The
model gave a minimum net gross margin of £60,000 (across
the Farm Business Survey input values); among farmers, in
our stated preference survey, the minimum expected profit
was £0. We therefore applied an offset to the profit-utility
curve of £60,000 corresponding to the difference between a
farmer's stated minimum profit and the minimum profit
objective (net gross margin) that was output by the model.
This resulted in a recalibrated profit-utility curve so that 0%
satisfaction was achieved at a profit of £60,000 and 100%
satisfaction was achieved at £180,000.
Stated satisfaction curves for risk among farmers were
almost always linear, with decreasing relationships differing
in intercepts. To summarize this pattern, we first chose the x
intercept by finding the average risk value at which the farm-
er's satisfaction was 0% (£116,000). We then found the risk
value at which satisfaction first dropped below 100%
(£37,000). Our final curve was then a line with two
segments--one from risk = 0, satisfaction = 100% to risk =
£37,000, satisfaction = 100% and one from risk = £37,000,
satisfaction = 100% to risk = £116,000, satisfaction = 100%.
During pilot interviews, farmers identified the number of
different crops grown as an important and measurable indi-
cator of management complexity. Hence, we used the num-
ber of different crop types grown as a measure of crop
management complexity. The relationship between this
quantity and overall utility was more complex than for profit
or risk minimization because different farmers had three
qualitatively different curve shapes. One group preferred to
minimize the number of crops grown (monotonic decreasing
curve), another group preferred an intermediate number
(humped curve), and the remaining farmers preferred to
maximize the number of crops grown within the range avail-
able (monotonic increasing curve). The proportion of farm-
ers in each group was 31%, 50%, and 19%, respectively. To
translate this into a form suitable for the model, we calcu-
lated an average curve (utility against crop number) for each
group. The actual curves used are shown in Figure 1, and all
cropping predictions made from our model were calculated
as weighted sums of solutions for each of the three farmer
preference types.

We use a profit model (see Annetts & Audsley, 2002;
Rounsevell et al., 2003, for a full description) to calculate
Figure 1. Average stated preference curves for crop
management complexity showing three different groups of
farmers.
Note: Open circles = those who prefer complex cropping arrangements,

and closed circles = those who prefer the simplest cropping arrangements
possible. These curves were used to specify the shape of the utility versus
crop complexity function in the socioeconomic model.

(4)
which is composed of three parts: the gross margin, G

, for

, of each field operation, including
any timeliness penalty (the jth operation on crop i in period
k); and the costs, C

, of the machines and labor required to
perform the field operations. The model variables are a
i
, the
area of crop i; x
ijk
, the area of operation, j, on crop i in period
k; and the number of machines n
m
of type m. Each variable is
accompanied by its corresponding coefficient.
A series of constraints is applied to ensure that only
realistic solution vectors are obtained when maximizing
the profit objective (Equation 4). These constraints have
previously been described in detail by Rounsevell et al.
(2003) and Annetts and Audsley (2002). In summary,
they ensure that the following conditions are met: (a)
total land area is constant, (b) all necessary field opera-
tions are performed for each crop in the required sequence,
(c) the labor and machinery required to perform field
operations do not exceed that available, and (d) that crops
are rotated such as to prevent the buildup of diseases and
pests. These constraints and their associated parameters
form the model's description of the farming system.
Parameters include commodity prices, machinery work
rates, rotational constraints on crops, and the timing of
agricultural operations required to bring a crop to har-
vest. The parameters come from a wide variety of sources,
the details of which are provided in Appendix B (Table
B1). The exact parameter values used are available as
online supplementary material.
The model is based on a description of farming at the
level of a single operation and assumes that the soil type
and rainfall are constant across the entire farm. As large
farms may include land with a variety of soil types, we
used a weighted average solution over the soil types pres-
ent in the county where the farm was located. Yearly rain-
fall was taken to be the average for that county. Soil type
and rainfall affect the work rates for various operations,
and the amount of time available for fieldwork in each
fortnight of the year. In cases where crop yield values
were not available from the Farm Business Survey for a
particular farmer, a calculation based on soil type and
rainfall was used to obtain a predicted yield. This calcula-
tion was performed by extrapolating between worst and
best expected yields for a crop (Agro Business
Consultants, 2004; Nix, 2007) assuming that light soils
have the lowest yields and heavy soils the highest. Soil
types were calculated based on the methodology described
in Rounsevell et al. (2003).
Risk Minimization Objective
We included a risk objective in our model following the basic
principle of minimization of total absolute deviation in prof-
its (Hazell, 1971). This is an approximation to the true risk in
whole-farm profit because it does not explicitly account for
the "risk spreading" that occurs when farmers grow a range
of crops with uncorrelated deviations. In our model, the risk
objective was calculated according to the formula:
O x
i i
i
risk
= 
  ,
(5)
where the sum is over all crops, x
i
is the area of the ith
crop, 
i
is the standard deviation in output (price times yield)
per hectare for the ith crop, and  is a constant factor
(explained below). In interviews, farmers were asked to
specify their stated preference for risk. It is unrealistic to
expect interview participants to conceptualize risk directly in
mathematical terms, so they were instead asked to envisage a
series of scenarios in which the range of their farm income
(difference between minimum and maximum over a period
of 3-4 years) varied from £0 (minimum) up to the maximum
range they would expect. While this definition is different
from that used in our model, we assume that the two are
related by the constant factor, . To estimate , we make the
following approximate argument.
First, the expected deviation in whole-farm profit will be
less than the sum of absolute deviations in profitability of the
different crops grown. As farmers grow five crops on aver-
age (as indicated by the Farm Business Survey) and assum-
ing that crop outputs vary independently, the whole-farm risk
should equal the deviation in the average income from five
independently varying values. Thus, the sample standard
deviation of effective total profit should roughly equal / 5
, where  is the area-weighted average of standard deviations
of individual crops. We assumed that farmers considered the
maximum and minimum possible values of their income
based on 10 years experience (many farmers had much more
experience farming, but as farm technology and policies
change rapidly, we assumed that this was a reasonable rele-
vant range). We related this to the standard deviation in crop
profitability by considering a sample of 10 independent years
from a distribution with standard deviation 
i
and calculating
the range of the sample numerically. The result of this calcu-
lation was 3.1
I
. Combining this with the fact that risks are
spread among crops, we obtain an approximate value of 
equal to 1.4. This value is clearly approximate, so we exam-
ined values of  from 0.5 to 2.0 in increments of 0.5. The
value that resulted in the best fit to data (after also minimiz-
ing the sum of squared differences over risk and crop com-
plexity preferences) was  = 1.0; we used this value in all
subsequent analyses.
6 SAGE Open
Statistical Methodology for Comparing
Land-Use Data With Model Outputs
Empirical Data Used
We compared the outputs of the socioeconomic model with a
largenationaldataset,theFarmBusinessSurvey(Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs & National
Assembly for Wales, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005; Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food & National Assembly for
Wales, 2001). The Farm Business Survey is an annual survey
of farm businesses across the United Kingdom, including
around 3,000 farms in England and Wales. We used the data
from England and Wales in this study. Information is pro-
vided on an individual farm basis and includes the area,
yield, and sale price of each crop grown but not the precise
location of the farm. For this analysis, we selected lowland
arable farms. Specifically, we included farmers whose hold-
ings were largely below 300 m altitude and for whom arable
crops and set-aside accounted for more than 85% of their
farmed area. From this sample, we excluded farms <100 ha,
because off-farm income probably constitutes a significant
portion of the farm business in such cases.
As the farming model makes predictions about long-term
cropping, we used average crop areas in the time period 2000
to 2004, calculated individually for each farm. We chose this
period to avoid modeling farmer responses to the introduc-
tion of the single farm payment (introduced in 2005), because
the long-term effects of this policy are unlikely to be appar-
ent during its introductory phase, and it would therefore pro-
vide inappropriate data for comparison with our equilibrium
model. Farms were excluded if more than 2 years' data were
missing in the 2000 to 2004 time period. The final data set
included individual average crop areas between 2000 and
2004 for 149 farms.
We configured the model to predict land use for eight
crops (including bare fallow/set-aside) with a combined area
that accounts for approximately 85% of arable land in
England (Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, 2008). Crops were winter wheat, winter oilseed rape,
winter barley, spring barley, legumes (arable pea and bean
crops), sugar beet, and potatoes. We also included temporar-
ily unused "set-aside" land. All our comparisons between
simulated and actual land use were made relative to the area
of these land-use types.
Model Runs
To generate cropping predictions for each farm, we used the
time-averaged crop yield values for each farm in our sample
from the Farm Business Survey, as inputs for our socioeco-
nomic model. Other than soil type and rainfall (which varied
by county), all other variables were kept fixed across farms.
In cases where a farmer did not grow a particular crop, we
allowed the model to generate yield values for that crop
based on soil type and rainfall (see "Profit Objective" sec-
tion). As the location of farms in the Farm Business Survey
was only known to county level, we used a weighted average
of model results for each of the soil types and rainfalls pres-
ent in that county. An additional issue associated with the use
of such spatially coarse data is that the distance to sugar beet
factories is unknown, so the cost of sugar beet haulage can-
not be calculated. As haulage has a very strong effect on the
profitability of sugar beet (Nix, 2007), we did not attempt to
predict its area but simply fixed its value to the area reported
in the Farm Business Survey. Our comparisons of model fit
are therefore based on relative crop areas excluding sugar
beet.
Measuring Model Fit
We evaluated the fit of our socioeconomic model to empiri-
cal data in three ways by (a) calculating a general metric of
disagreement between model outputs and data across all
crops, (b) testing for correlations between crop areas in the
model and data at the aggregate level (i.e., averages across
all farmers), and (c) assessing the fit of a multivariate crop-
choice regression of model outputs against data at the indi-
vidual farm level.
The metric comparing predicted and observed data is sim-
ply the sum of squared differences:
SS = -
( )

 x o
ci ci
c
i
2
,
(6)
where x
ci
is the model prediction for the area of crop c on
the ith individual farm, and o
ci
is the respective observed
value. We used this as a measure of absolute disagreement
between model outputs and data. To test whether there were
significant absolute differences between x
c
and o
c
, we used a
sign test (a nonparametric test for significant difference
between paired samples) for each crop type.
To test for correlations between crop areas at the aggre-
gate level, we first calculated the average relative crop areas
across all farmers in the model and in the data set. We then
tested for correlations between model and data by calculating
a Spearman rank correlation, treating the average area for
each crop as an independent datum.
To compare modeled and observed data at the individual
farm level, we fitted a crop-choice regression. Our statistical
model is similar to other crop-choice models (e.g., Seo &
Mendelsohn, 2008), but allows for multiple choices, as U.K.
arable farmers always grow a variety of crops. We label the
vector of actual crop choices for the ith observation, c
i
, and
we label the corresponding model outputs x
i
. The crop-
choice vectors from the socioeconomic model, x
i
, are viewed
as the independent variable and the actual crop-choice
vectors are viewed as the dependent variable. In their raw
form, the relative crop areas in each vector c
i
are continuous
Cooke et al. 7
variables, but actually farmers make cropping choices in dis-
crete chunks depending on a range of factors, including the
size of fields and the available resources. Thus, the dominant
underlying process giving rise to c
i
is not continuous but dis-
crete. For this reason, we modeled c
i
as a vector of counts
where each element represents the number of area subunits
allotted to a crop. This choice was also motivated by the fact
that histograms of the elements of c were strongly nonnor-
mal, showing a mode at or close to zero and another mode at
some larger value. To convert from continuous crop areas to
discrete counts, we set the number of subunits per farm equal
to 20. We then rounded values of the elements of c
i
to the
nearest multiple of the subunit size. As the use of smaller
numbers of subunits leads to an increase in rounding error,
we tested several potential values for the number of subunits
per farm and chose 20, because it was the largest value such
that each of the elements of c
i
approximated a binomial dis-
tribution. It is important to note that although the total num-
ber of subunits is 20, this equates to an effective number of
subunits per crop of between 2 and 5, depending on the crop
area, and is therefore much more strongly discrete than it
might at first seem.
We assumed that our crop responses, c, came from a mul-
tinomial distribution with probabilities j
corresponding to
the relative probabilities that a subunit of land would be allo-
cated to the jth crop type. Each observation has associated
with it a vector of such probabilities,

and we assume that the log odds

of choosing crop j
compared with Crop 1 (the reference crop which we chose to
be winter wheat) are related to the outputs of the mechanistic
model. This statistical model is summarized in Equation 7:

indicates that the crop area prediction is unrelated to the
actual crop area.
In all our statistical analyses, we used Bayesian inference
with uninformative priors to estimate parameter values.
Specifically, we used normal distributions with  = 1,000 as
priors for the  and  parameters. Posterior densities were
calculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with
the Metropolis algorithm via the function "metrop" in the R
package MCMC. We used the posterior modes as starting
values, and obtained these via a call to the "optim" function
in R. We also used the "optim" function to calculate the vari-
ance­covariance matrix, which was in turn used to scale the
jump size in "metrop." We used 10 million samples and dis-
carded the first half as burn-in. Convergence was checked
using the Geweke (1992) diagnostic (see also Cowles &
Carlin, 1996) via the R package "coda" (Plummer, Best,
Cowles, & Vines, 2006).
Model comparisons were performed using the deviance
information criterion (DIC) (Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, &
van der Linde, 2002). The DIC is a Bayesian model selection
criterion that penalizes complex models with more parame-
ters in a similar manner to the Akaike information criterion
(AIC), commonly used in frequentist analyses. DIC is calcu-
lated directly from posterior densities according to the for-
mula (Gelman, Carlin, Stern, & Rubin, 2002):

where 2  ( )
D y

is the average of the deviance over the
posterior samples and D y

( )

is a point estimate of the
deviance at the posterior mean value of the parameters. The
deviance is defined as twice the negative of the log likeli-
hood. We use DIC throughout, though our overall conclu-
sions would be unaffected by alternative choices of criteria
for model fit.
We modeled the relationship between predicted and actual
cropping using three different analyses based on the statisti-
cal model shown in Equation 7. In each analysis, the predic-
tor variable is altered to reflect a different conceptual model
of the system. The first predictor variable represented a
benchmark unrelated to the mechanistic model, and was sim-
ply the gross margin value for each crop type. This bench-
mark regression quantifies the relationship between variable
inputs to the mechanistic model (gross margins) and actual
crop area. The remaining predictor variables were (a) outputs
from the socioeconomic model based on pure-profit maximi-
zation; (b) outputs from the socioeconomic model, including
values for risk and crop complexity preferences obtained
from the stated preferences survey; and (c) outputs from the
socioeconomic model, including values for risk and crop
complexity that were a best fit to the sum of squared differ-
ences (Equation 5).
Results
Best-Fit Estimates for Risk and Crop Complexity
Preferences
The relationship between model fit (measured as sum of
squared differences) and a range of risk and crop complexity
preferences is shown in Figure 2. The plot shown represents
 = 1, and has a clear minimum point when the risk parame-
ter equals 22% of the profit preference (all preference
weights are relative to profit at 100%). The relative influence
of the risk preference on model fit is clearly much larger than
for the crop complexity objective, but a less obvious mini-
mum also exists for this parameter at 8%. These risk and
crop complexity values represent average revealed
8 SAGE Open
preferences for the farmers in the Farm Business Survey.
They compare with averages of the stated preference weights
of 37% and 35% for risk and crop complexity, respectively,
derived from our survey of 47 farmers.
Aggregate-Level Comparisons
For all crops, sign tests showed significant differences
between model outputs and the Farm Business Survey results
(the hypothesis x = c was rejected with p < 10-5 in all cases).
This clearly demonstrates that for each of the crops, there is
a bias in model predictions away from the observed values.
The magnitude of these biases can be seen in Figure 3, which
compares average crop areas (across all 149 farms) in the
Farm Business Survey data and the model predictions.
Results are shown for the pure-profit model (Figure 3a), a
model using the best-fit (minimum sum of squared differ-
ences) values for risk and crop complexity (Figure 3b), and a
model with stated preference values for the risk and crop
complexity parameters (Figure 3c). In each plot, a straight
line indicates perfect agreement between modeled and
observed data. Winter wheat is clearly the dominant crop but
is always underpredicted by the model. In the pure-profit
case (Figure 3a), the model severely overpredicts the area of
potatoes and, to a lesser extent, overpredicts oilseed rape and
bean crop areas. This fit is improved when farmer's revealed
and stated preferences for risk minimization are taken into
account (Figures 3b and 3c). The main changes occur when
risk preferences are applied. In particular, potatoes (which
have high risk), and set-aside (which is low risk, with guar-
anteed subsidy income and near zero input cost), change rap-
idly as the risk preference is increased.
A Spearman rank test for correlation was not significant
for the pure-profit model (Figure 3a;  = .53, p = .23) but was
significant for the model including stated preferences (Figure
3c;  = .96, p = .003). The correlation for the model using
revealed preferences (best-fit preferences from Figure 2)
gave an intermediate correlation coefficient (Figure 3b;  =
.75, p = .06). At first sight, this last result would seem to
contradict the fact that the revealed preferences represent the
minimum of sum of squared differences. However, as the
Spearman rank test is based purely on rank order rather than
minimizing squared differences, there is no inconsistency to
be resolved.

Individual-Level Comparisons
Predicted (using stated preferences) and observed crop areas
for seven types of land use on the 149 Farm Business Survey
farms are compared in Figure 4. Visual inspection of this fig-
ure reveals that there is clearly a large amount of residual
variation. The best predictions are obtained for winter wheat
(the dominant crop) and for set-aside. Our statistical analysis
(using the model described by Equation 7) revealed positive
relationships between predicted and observed areas for most
crops in Figure 4. The results of this regression are presented
in Table 1 for four different models: (a) a purely empirical
model that simply regressed crop gross margins against
observed crop areas, (b) a pure-profit run of the model, (c) a
run of the model using revealed preferences for risk and crop
complexity (the best fits to the sum of squared deviations),
and (d) a run of the model using stated preference values for
risk and crop complexity. The overall ability of each model
variant to explain variation in the observed cropping is sum-
marized by the DIC values (small values are better). Note
that in the case of the stated preference model, the DIC was
modified by 1 to account for the externally fitted parameter 
and was modified by 3 for the revealed preference model to
account for fitted risk and crop complexity as well as . The
stated preference model is clearly the best on this criterion,
followed by the revealed preference model, and then the
pure-profit model. The purely empirical benchmark model
shows the worst fit.

Discussion
In this article, we conducted a detailed statistical comparison
between the outputs of a farm-level land-use model and
observed cropping decisions over a 5-year period (2000-
2004). Two main findings are presented. The first is that
model results are essentially uncorrelated with actual farmer
behavior, unless the model is modified to include farmer
preferences other than pure profit (in our case, risk aversion
and crop management complexity). Our second finding is
that stated preference results can be used to parameterize
models of farmer behavior, quantifying preference for risk
aversion and potentially other preferences that might influ-
ence crop management decisions.
The question of whether multiple farm preferences (espe-
cially risk aversion) are a required component of predictive
land-use models has been studied for many years. For exam-
ple, Lin, Dean, and Moore (1974) reached the conclusion
that profit-only models were inadequate based on a small
sample of 6 farms, and more recently Rounsevell et al. (2003)
found that farmers were approximately profit maximizers.
Nevertheless, despite the long history of work examining
this question, it remains unresolved (Just & Pope, 2003),
partly because the sample sizes of some previous studies
have been too small to analyze statistically (see, for example,
Arriaza & Gómez-Limón, 2003; Lin et al., 1974), and
because risk aversion is not likely to be important in all farm-
ing contexts (Edwards-Jones, Dreary, & Willcock, 1998). It
is therefore unlikely that any single study will completely
resolve the issue. Rather, a series of studies such as ours,
which statistically compare model outputs with observed
farmer behavior, and which use a large sample size (149
farms) are needed to examine the validity of modeling
approaches in specific contexts.
There is a considerable body of work describing models
for predicting the behavior of arable farmers in the United
Kingdom and for closely related farming systems in conti-
nental Europe. A particularly relevant example is the work of
Rounsevell et al. (2003), who used a similar profit model to
ours, and conducted a quasi validation using a large number
of sample points across East Anglia. Based on a comparison
of crop areas for wheat, grass, and cereals, Rounsevell et al.
found support for a profit-only model, but suggested that fac-
tors such as risk might also be important (though this was not
tested). As our conclusions are somewhat at odds with the
results of this article, it is worth explaining the difference. In
our case, we conducted statistics on the basis of crop choice
across a wide range of crops (8), and effectively tested the
model's ability to predict choices based on known yields and
prices (inputs in our case). In contrast, Rounsevell et al.
attempted to predict yields (using a formula based on soil
type) but concentrated on the model's ability to predict major
crops. The difference between our results and those of
Rounsevell et al. is interesting because they suggest that
farmers'choices may be more consistent with profit maximi-
zation when choosing among major crops, but that risk and
other factors may influence those choices when minor crops
and break crops are considered. Although small in total area,
minor land uses such as set-aside or spring crops can be very
important when modeling environmental issues.
We used a mixed-integer programming model to repre-
sent the profit, risk, and crop complexity functions of farm-
ers in our study. Models of this type have a long history in
agricultural modeling and many such models remain in use
as policy tools (Arfini, 2005). The important alternative of
PMP (de Frahan, 2005; Howitt, 1995) involves construction
of a simplified profit function to which a correction is found
such that the model can exactly reproduce a training data set.
The advantage of this approach is that any aspect of the sys-
tem that is relatively static does not need explicit description
but instead can be subsumed into the correction function.
Although this approach has proven to be very useful for pol-
icy prediction, it typically subsumes many aspects of farmer
behavior, including risk aversion and crop complexity pref-
erence into the correction function. This is a problem if the
goal of the study is to predict behavior under circumstances
substantially different from the training data. It is therefore
important that research into more explicit models continues
alongside development of PMP. In particular, our study
chose an explicit modeling approach rather than PMP
because our goal was to explicitly test the importance of
including behavioral functions in the model and to provide a
means for their parameterization via interviews.
One of the principal practical difficulties with multiobjec-
tive behavioral models is that the relative weights of differ-
ent objectives are difficult to quantify. In our study, we
obtained these objective weights independently using
detailed interviews with a sample of 49 farmers. Although
interviews and stated preference surveys of farmers have
often found support for land-use objectives other than profit
(Gasson, 1973; McGregor et al., 1996; Perkin & Rehman,
1994), our study is unique in its ability to transfer these stated
preferences directly into a land-use model. The main advan-
tage of using stated preferences to parameterize a model is
that they can be obtained relatively easily and independently
of the land-use data used to test the model. The disadvantage
is that it is difficult to elicit numerically accurate statements
from interview participants without introducing well-known
biases (Pöyhönen, Vrolijk, & Hämäläinen, 2001; Weber &
Borcherding, 1993). For two key land-use objectives, risk
preference and crop complexity preference, we obtained val-
ues corresponding to a best fit between our model and farmer
behavior (in the form of land-use data). We found that the
agreement between these best-fit values and stated values
was much better for risk aversion than for crop complexity
preference. As we used average satisfaction curves for both
Cooke et al. 11
these objectives in our model, this disparity may be due to
differences in the variance of satisfaction curves for each
objective. It is difficult to reduce variance satisfaction curves
to a simple numeric measure, but at a semiquantitative level,
it is clear that risk (45/47 farmers with monotonic decreasing
curves) was much less variable than crop complexity (31%
decreasing, 50% humped, and 19% increasing). The fact that
we condensed this variability into an average set of objective
curves to be used across all farmers is not ideal, especially
for the crop complexity parameter. In future work, we would
like to collect land-use data for the 49 farmers interviewed
rather than rely on existing land-use databases that provide
data for different farmers.
Tight integration in this study between model building
and the design of preference elicitation interviews was essen-
tial for developing a well-parameterized socioeconomic
model. In addition to providing parameters, the stated prefer-
ence survey was used to screen objectives for inclusion in the
model based on the relative importance to farmers and rela-
tive influence on crop-choice variability. As model complex-
ity rapidly increases with the inclusion of additional
objectives, this latter step is crucial to successful model
development. However, it is possible that further improve-
ments to the accuracy of arable landscape models could be
achieved through the inclusion of additional objectives such
as landscape structure, wildlife, and nonproduction land use.
The key to the success of such work, however, will be the
joint collection of detailed financial, physical, and prefer-
ence information at the individual farm level. Such informa-
tion will be essential to reduce noise due to parameter error
and allow the relative performance of different models to be
assessed.
Appendix A
Farmer Objectives forAgricultural Land-Use Models In elic-
iting measurable farmer objectives, a stepwise procedure
encompassing literature review, pilot interviews, and focus
group discussions was used to identify and classify objec-
tives. This led to the identification of 15 criteria (objectives)
that could be measured, grouped under 7 fundamental objec-
tives. The appearance of the farm was the most complex
objective with 7 criteria identified, the remaining objectives
having either one or two criteria measures.
Farming income (£/year): This is defined as annual
income generated through land management only, con-
sisting of crop enterprise output, single farm payment,
agri-environment payments, other land-based grants
and subsidies, and land-based diversification income
after fixed and variable costs were accounted for.
Risk (absolute deviation in arable farming income): Some
farmers are prepared to cope with a widely varying
income on the chance that some years will be very
good. Others would rather have an income that is more
constant across years but potentially lower. Farmers
were asked to provide the best possible and worst pos-
sible amount their farming income could vary by over
a 5-year period. The shape of utility was then assessed
across this range.
Management complexity: Less formally, this is the amount
of difficulty associated with running a number of dif-
ferent enterprises and operations simultaneously
within the farming year. For this objective, farmers
were asked to consider two different land management
criteria--the number of different crops grown and the
number of different entry-level environmental stew-
ardship options managed.
Appearance of the farm: Concerns about the environment
tended to be split into those that had an effect on the
appearance and atmosphere of the farm, and those that
influenced natural resources (water, soil, and air). The
criteria identified for this objective encompassed land-
scape structure (length of hedgerow, area of wood-
land), biodiversity (bird species diversity, bird species
population size), and the appearance of cropped areas
(number of tall weeds that appear above the crop can-
opy, number of low weeds, number of skylark squares).
Lifestyle and recreation: The personal circumstances of
farmers vary widely. Two ways in which lifestyle and
recreation directly influence land management were
identified--the amount of time spent farming and the
amount of time spent shooting game. First, the time
available for farming can vary for a number of rea-
sons, from semiretirement to having a full-time job
elsewhere and farming during weekends and annual
leave. In terms of land management, the reasons for
needing more or less free time are not as important as
the number of days available to the individual for
farming. Second, if an important component of farm-
ers' recreational activity is a game shoot, it is likely
that this will also influence their land management
decisions.
Autonomy (number of regulatory constraint sets): With
the exception of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, participa-
tion in English agricultural land-based schemes is not
mandatory. These nonmandatory schemes come with
an administrative burden and a set of rules and regula-
tions to abide by. Farmers were asked to consider
whether they would not sign up to schemes because of
the additional regulatory constraints.
Land-based diversification (commercial shooting): There
are two aspects that potentially distinguish land man-
agement for commercial shooting, that is, on-farm
game shooting activity catering for paying individuals,
from recreational shooting identified under lifestyle
12 SAGE Open
and recreation. First, the measurement scales on which
utility is measured were found to be different.
Satisfaction with recreational shooting was expressed
in terms of the time that could be spent on the activity
(days per season). The utility of a commercial shoot
was expressed as the number of paid for birds shot per
season. Second, the management required to generate
income from shooting may run counter to the manage-
ment required for optimal arable output, resulting in a
trade-off between income sources. For these reasons,
commercial shooting was assessed separately (see
Figure B1).

Author Biographies
Ira R. Cooke is currently a research scientist with the Life Sciences
Computation Centre at La Trobe University, Australia. He has
applied computational and statistical techniques to answering a
broad range of life science questions ranging from landscape ecol-
ogy to subcellular processes.
Elizabeth H. A. Mattison is a postdoctoral research assistant
whose work explores land managers' beliefs and intentions and
their effects on associated biodiversity. She has worked in a variety
of agricultural and wildlife management contexts developing pre-
dictive models of biodiversity outcomes.
Eric Audsley is a principal research fellow at Cranfield University.
Before that, he worked for 34 years at Silsoe Research Institute,
formerly the U.K. Agricultural Research Council's National
Institute of Agricultural Engineering, until its closure in 2005. He
has developed the application of mathematical and operational
research techniques to the analysis of decisions concerning a very
wide range of agricultural systems. Currently major areas are linear
programming modeling of farms to predict future agricultural land
use and model-based environmental Life Cycle Inventory Analysis
(LCA) of agricultural production systems.
Alison P. Bailey is a senior lecturer in agricultural business man-
agement at the University of Reading. Her research focuses on the
analysis of agricultural production systems and the relationship
between agriculture, the environment, and socioeconomic criteria.
This includes assessment of farmer decision-making processes and
motivations associated with farming practice.
Robert P. Freckleton is a professor of population biology at the
University of Sheffield. He works on the application of ecological
and evolutionary models to understand the effects of environmental
change on ecological systems.
Anil Graves is a Senior Research Fellow in Land Use Systems and
applies his background in the natural and social sciences to investi-
gating land use problems. Initially he spent several years in India
researching the hydrological and social impacts of reforestation,
coastal saline intrusion, and groundwater abstraction. Since return-
ing to the UK, he has worked on a range of UK and EU projects,
researching the biophysical, economic, and social aspects of arable,
forestry, and agroforestry systems in Europe, and more recently, on
the application of the ecosystem framework.
Joe Morris is emeritus professor in resource economics and
management in the School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield
University, Bedford, England. His recent work has focused on
the sustainable management of agriculture and natural resources
with particular reference to the economics of land, water, and
ecosystems.

Simon A. Queenborough is currently a senior research associate
at The Ohio State University, USA. He is interested in mecha-
nisms of species coexistence, and the evolutionary and ecological
effects of variation in breeding systems and patterns of resource
allocation.
Daniel L. Sandars is a research fellow in operational research in
natural resource management at Cranfield University's School of
Applied Sciences and formerly at the Silsoe Research Institute's
Biomathematics, and Mathematics and Decisions Systems groups.
Gavin M. Siriwardena is head of Land-Use Research at the
British Trust for Ornithology. He works primarily on bird ecology
in farmland and other terrestrial habitats, with a particular focus on
population responses to management and habitat characteristics.
Paul Trawick is the chair of the Department of Sociocultural
Anthropology at Idaho State University. His research interests
focus on the management of water for irrigation, viewing the prob-
lem as a social rather than a technological one. By comparing suc-
cessful irrigation systems in different parts of the world, he has
identified the institutions and operating principles for sharing a
scarce water resource.
Andrew R. Watkinson is executive director of the Living With
Environmental Change partnership and a professorial fellow at the
University of East Anglia. He was formerly director of the Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change Research. He is interested in the appli-
cation of population biology in farming systems and the impacts of
environmental change on the coastal zone.
William J. Sutherland holds the Miriam Rothschild Chair in con-
servation biology at the University of Cambridge. He is interested
in predictive models of ecological systems, improving the effec-
tiveness of the use of science in policy and in evidence-based
conservation.
