Variables, and Statistical Power

Objectives. This study compares the use of the binary disease variables with counts of the same conditions in models
of self-rated health to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. In particular, the analysis
seeks to determine if statistical power is adequate for the binary variable approach.
Methods. Morbidity measures from adults in 2 large national surveys were used in both cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal analyses.
Results. Although differences across the approaches are modest, the binary variable approach offers greater explana-
tory power and slightly higher R2 values. Despite these advantages, statistical power is insufficient in some cases, espe-
cially for conditions that are relatively rare and/or that manifest modest differences on the outcome variable.
Discussion. Statistical power estimates are advisable when using the binary variable approach, especially if the list
of diseases and health conditions is extensive. Although a simple count of diseases may be useful in some research ap-
plications, separate counts for serious and nonserious conditions should be more useful in many research projects while
avoiding the risk of inadequate statistical power.
HE accurate measurement and use of morbidity infor-
mation are critical for gerontological, epidemiologic,
and health services research. Adulthood, especially later
adulthood, is a time of increasing prevalence of chronic dis-
ease, and the influence of comorbidity may be quite conse-
quential to health trajectories. Although morbidity has been
examined as an independent variable in thousands of stud-
ies, relatively little systematic research has considered the
consequences of various methods for measuring morbidity
as an independent variable.
Virtually all surveys that measure morbidity have a series
of questions that query whether a person has a given disease
or condition. Most gerontologists and health scientists using
health surveys or medical records begin with the binary (in-
dicator) variables of disease, but may use the indicators in
different ways. The decision of how to use the disease indi-
cators is important, because it may lead to different conclu-
sions about the effect of morbidity on a wide range of out-
comes, from self-rated health (Idler, 1993) to hospital
mortality rates (Iezzoni, 1997). It could also have profound
policy implications. For instance, if a disease is not found to
influence an outcome such as disability or mortality, there
may be an inclination to treat the disease less aggressively.
A very common practice in the gerontological literature
has been to sum the disease indicators to form an overall
measure of comorbidity (Fillenbaum, 1979; Gibson, 1991;
House et al., 1994; Levkoff, Cleary, & Wetle, 1987; Liang,
Bennett, Whitelaw, & Maeda, 1991; Liang, Lawrence, Ben-
nett, & Whitelaw, 1990; McBroom, 1970; Whitelaw & Liang,
1991). A chief advantage of this procedure is parsimony,
especially when a long battery of diseases is presented to
participants or when panel data are used to assess change in
comorbidity and other phenomena (e.g., social support). A
second advantage is that this approach uses all the disease
information, even that from the rare conditions. The result-
ing composite expresses comorbidity in an additive form,
and it conveniently differentiates people at each level of
overall morbidity.
The other major approach has been to use dummy vari-
ables for each illness to avoid simple sums of very different
conditions (e.g., Crimmins & Saito, 1993; Idler & Kasl,
1991; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992). Separate variables to
distinguish the various illnesses are less parsimonious but
keep the unique contribution of the conditions salient. In ad-
dition, they permit investigators to examine how special
combinations of diseases may interact in affecting health-
related outcomes. Fried, Bandeen-Roche, Kaser, and Gu-
ralnik (1999) recently found such interactive effects of dis-
eases on disability in the Women's Health and Aging Study.
Reports of such analyses are rare, perhaps in part because of
the complexity involved, but the binary variable approach is
the only way in which the unique contribution of a dis-
ease--or, ultimately, interactions of diseases--may be as-
certained. Proponents of the binary variable approach fur-
ther argue that because the correlation among the various
disease indicators is typically modest, summing disease in-
dicators is akin to adding the proverbial apples and oranges
(Schmitt & Colligan, 1984).
One concern when using the binary variable approach is
parsimony. Although parsimony is a concern for many sur-
veys that ask respondents questions about a "short list" of
diseases (less than 15 conditions), it is even more of a con-
cern when the surveys have a larger battery of questions on
diseases. Indeed, some investigators have used factor analy-
sis of the binary disease variables to reduce their number
(e.g., Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992, reduced their list from 13
T

to 7). The issue of parsimony is even more important when
disease is treated as a dependent variable.
Closely related to, but distinct from, the issue of parsi-
mony is statistical power (Cohen, 1988). Although power is
an elementary statistical issue, it is not apparent that re-
searchers are systematically taking it into account when us-
ing the binary variable approach. The usefulness of the bi-
nary variable approach in population samples is highly
dependent on the distribution of the conditions or diseases
under investigation--what is often referred to as the base-
rate problem in studies of accidents or rare diseases
(Schmitt & Colligan, 1984). Statistical power for testing the
effect of a condition on a quantitative variable is a function
of sample size, the distribution of the condition in the sam-
ple, and the difference in means on the quantitative variable
between those who do and do not have the condition. Thus,
if conditions are rare (e.g., stroke, hip fracture), then it is
less likely that there will be adequate statistical power for
testing their effects with the binary variable approach. In
such cases, the possibility of "false negatives" is great--
investigators conclude that disease x does not influence an
outcome when, in fact, the statistical chance for it to do so is
low. If, instead, the investigator used the count variable ap-
proach, at least the contribution of disease x, expressed in
the comorbidity term, could be estimated. It is clear that
each approach has its advantages and disadvantages--each
may be appropriate for given research questions.
Although there is no routine approach for all research
problems, there is value in systematically examining the
consequences of using these two approaches on the relevant
statistical criteria. The purpose of this article is to compare
these two approaches, along with two closely related ap-
proaches, to better understand the advantages and disadvan-
tages of each. The present research compares these proce-
dures for measuring morbidity in both cross-sectional and
longitudinal analyses, with explicit attention given to statis-
tical power, parsimony, and model fit. We use self-rated
health as the outcome to illustrate how the different proce-
dures influence findings from two large national data sets.
The results have direct implications for the large and grow-
ing literature on self-rated health as a global perception of
overall health status (e.g., Idler, 1993; Jylhä, Guralnik, Fer-
rucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen, 1998), but the aim of this analy-
sis is to clarify the relative merits of the alternative mea-
sures of disease information. Therefore, special attention is
given to the issue of statistical power.
METHODS
Samples
Data for this analysis are from two national surveys: Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-I: Epide-
miologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) and Health and Retire-
ment Study (HRS). These two surveys were chosen because
they are widely used public archives, permit longitudinal
analysis, and use unique strategies for collecting morbidity
information on a national sample.
The NHEFS collected medical examination and survey
interview data in 1971­1975 using a multistage, stratified,
probability sample of noninstitutionalized persons ages 25­
74. The analyses will be completed on the baseline NHEFS
subsample, designed as a nationally representative sample,
which was administered the "detailed component," includ-
ing an extensive medical examination (N  6,913; National
Center for Health Statistics, 1979). The baseline for the
NHEFS was administered in modules. Although 14,407 re-
spondents 25­74 years of age were given selected modules,
respondents in the detailed component received all modules
including the health care needs and general well-being
questions. Sampling and operational details are provided
elsewhere (Cornoni-Huntley, Huntley, & Feldman, 1990;
National Center for Health Statistics, 1987). The survey is
longitudinal, and the present analysis makes use of the first
follow-up, approximately 10 years later (due to the exten-
sive field operations of the baseline). This analysis is based
on the 6,833 non-Hispanic White and Black respondents at
the baseline and 4,986 reinterviewed respondents at the first
follow-up.
The HRS is a nationally representative survey of 7,706
households with at least one person age 51 to 61. The data
contain a total of 12,652 respondents (Juster & Suzman,
1995). The baseline interview was conducted in 1992 and
follow-up interviews have occurred every 2 years thereafter.
The spouses of selected respondents were interviewed for HRS,
but this analysis excludes the spouses who are secondary re-
spondents. The analysis is based on the 5,637 non-Hispanic
White and Black, age-eligible, primary respondents (i.e.,
ages 51 to 61) who were interviewed at the baseline in 1992.
Of these respondents, 5,154 (91%) were successfully rein-
terviewed in 1994. The sample size for the longitudinal
analysis is 5,151 because 3 age-eligible cases, who did not
answer the self-reported health measure in 1994, were ex-
cluded.
The surveys have different lag times between waves--10
years for NHEFS and 2 years for HRS. Although there
would be value in testing models across surveys with the
same time lags, effect sizes can vary as a function of the
length of the time lag. Thus, as recommended by Gollob
and Reichardt (1987), there is value in using different lags
to study the same relationship to obtain a more "complete
understanding of a variable's effect" (p. 82).
Measurement
The measurement of self-reported morbidity in NHEFS
was derived from a checklist question designed to identify
which illnesses respondents had. Respondents were asked,
"Has a doctor ever told you that you have. . .hypertension or
high blood pressure?" Overall, 36 conditions are presented.
The answer to such a question is not a report about how one
feels about a specific condition, but rather a report of a con-
dition based on a medical encounter. Each condition was
coded as a binary variable (1  yes, 0  no).
Morbidity in the HRS was measured by focusing on eight
target conditions that are prevalent among adults who are
middle aged or older and can lead to work disability (Wal-
lace & Herzog, 1995). Those conditions include adults who
have hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart
problems, psychiatric problems, arthritis, and who have had
a stroke. Each respondent was asked if he or she had ever
been told by a doctor that he or she had one of these condi-
MEASURING MORBIDITY S175
tions. Disease-specific questions were then asked concern-
ing medical treatment and functional impairment. Seven ad-
ditional diseases and conditions were measured through a
series of questions in which the respondent was asked, "Do
you have any of the following health problems?" The list of
conditions included asthma, back problems, foot and leg
problems, kidney or bladder problems, stomach or intestinal
ulcers, and high cholesterol. A separate question measures
whether the respondent had fractured a bone since he or she
was 45. Although the prevalence estimates derived from the
physician-referenced questions may be different from those
without a physician referent, the focus of the present analy-
sis is not estimating prevalence. Whereas the aim of this re-
search addresses the consequences of using different forms
of the disease indicators as independent variables, all 15
conditions queried are used in the analyses that follow.
Morbidity in both surveys will be treated several ways.
The focus of our research is comparing two approaches out-
lined earlier:
· simple count of all conditions
· a set of dummy variables for the conditions.
In addition, the following procedures for measuring mor-
bidity will be examined (the latter only with the NHEFS):
· separate counts of serious conditions and nonserious
(chronic) conditions
· diseases categorized according to the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD).
First, for these additional analyses, separate counts of se-
rious conditions and nonserious (chronic) conditions can be
developed from both surveys (Ferraro & Farmer, 1996,
1999; Mutran, & Ferraro, 1988). This approach, developed
in consultation with a panel of physicians and nurses, is rec-
ommended for avoiding the possible power problem of the
binary variable approach while offering more specific and
descriptive measures than the simple count of conditions.
The serious illness conditions include: cancer, diabetes,
heart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and stroke.
The remaining conditions, hereafter referred to as chronic
illness, are identified in Table 1; examples include arthritis,
asthma, bone fracture, cataracts, gout, psoriasis, and ulcer.
Although beyond the scope of the present analysis, mea-
sures of severity of illness are a more formal way to use
morbidity information and distinguish the seriousness of an
illness (Gonnella, Hornbrook, & Louis, 1984; Horn & Horn,
1986; Mulrow, Gerety, Cornell, Lawrence, & Kanten, 1994;
Parmelee, Thuras, Katz, & Lawton, 1995). Most of these se-
verity of illness measures used in previous research are
based on "computerized hospital discharge abstracts. . .or
information gathered from medical records by using ab-
straction protocols independent of specific diseases" (Iez-
zoni et al., 1995, p. 763). Although comparable data are not
available in NHEFS and HRS to conduct a robust test of es-
tablished severity measures, the use of the summed vari-
ables for serious and chronic (nonserious) conditions is a
less formal way to unpack the simple sum of conditions.
The separate counts enable one to understand the unique con-
tribution of sets of conditions that influence various health-
related outcomes in distinct ways (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999).
Second, given the large number of specific conditions in
NHEFS, it is possible to estimate parallel models with dis-
eases categorized according to the ICD, Eighth Revision
(ICD-8; World Health Organization, 1967). This approach
amounts to aggregating the original disease indicators into a
widely recognized system of disease classification (i.e., a
specialized count variable approach). Fourteen ICD-8 codes
are also used to simplify the list of 36 original variables
(ICD uses 17, but there are no conditions in 3 categories for
this sample). The ICD-8 has been revised, but the 8th revi-
sion was the most current at the time of the survey.
Table 1 displays the list of morbidity variables available
in the surveys and provides descriptive statistics for each.
The specific conditions common to both surveys are listed
first, in alphabetical order, followed by those that are unique
to NHEFS and HRS. It is clear that NHEFS queried respon-
dents about several conditions that appeared in very small
proportions (e.g., prevalence  1% for stroke, cataracts, de-
tached or other retina condition, glaucoma). On the other
hand, the more limited list employed by HRS focused on
conditions more prevalent in the age group studied (i.e.,
stroke was the least prevalent condition, 3%).
Self-rated health was measured identically in both sur-
veys with the question, "Would you say that your health in
general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" (Scor-
ing in this analysis ranges from 1  poor, to 5  excellent.)
The independent variables span a broad range of factors
known to be related to morbidity and self-rated health, ei-
ther directly or indirectly (e.g., Ferraro, 1980; Idler, 1993;
Krause, 1987). Although the list of covariates is not exhaus-
tive, it includes variables that are widely acknowledged in
the literature: age, gender, race, living alone, education, in-
come, present smoker, and past smoker.
Analysis Plan
The analysis proceeds in two major stages: a comparison
of alternative explanatory models and a statistical power
analysis. First, analyses comparing the alternative measures
of morbidity in cross-sectional and longitudinal models of
self-rated health were estimated with both ordinary least
squares (OLS) and logit models. The longitudinal models
are based on residualized change procedures in which Wave
2 self-rated health is regressed on Wave 1 self-rated health,
the morbidity indicators, and covariates. The longitudinal
analysis also accounts for selection bias due to attrition
(Heckman, 1979; Winship & Mare, 1992). Second, statisti-
cal power is calculated for each disease indicator and all
count variables. Power is also calculated for each disease
variable on subsamples of the NHEFS and HRS to demon-
strate the importance of power calculations in both the de-
sign and analysis of health data related to morbidity.
FINDINGS
Comparison of Morbidity Measures
Given that self-rated health has five response categories,
there are different approaches to modeling it as an outcome

variable. One approach is to use OLS, treating this ordinal
measure as though it were an interval measure. OLS has
been shown to be quite robust with ordinal measures that
approximate a normal distribution. This is even more likely
when the number of categories of the dependent variable is
large (O'Brien, 1979). A second logical approach is to use
an ordered logit (or probit) model. As Long (1997) points
out, when estimating an ordered logit model, one must test
the assumption of proportional odds across categories (i.e.,
that the odds ratio is constant across the categories of the
dependent variable). The results from that test indicate that
in both the NHEFS and HRS, the proportional odds assump-
tion is not satisfied. (We found similar results with an or-
dered probit--the parallel-lines assumption was not met.)
Thus, evidence indicates that ordered logit (or probit) mod-
els are not appropriate for these data.
In this instance, Long suggests two alternatives: (a) esti-
mate a multinomial logit model in which no ordering is im-
plied across the five categories; in essence, treat self-rated
health as a nominal variable and (b) collapse the five cate-
gories of self-rated health into two, and then use a binomial
logit model. We followed his recommendations and completed
the analyses in three basic ways: (a) OLS (b) multinomial
logit, and (c) binomial logit with two different categoriza-
tion schemes. (The five original categories of self-rated health
were grouped in two different ways: [a] excellent, very good,
and good vs. fair and poor--yielding roughly a 50/50 split
and [b] excellent, very good, good, and fair vs. poor--yielding
a split of approximately 78/22 in each data set.) Whereas all
three strategies yielded similar results, we present the OLS
results for the most parsimonious and straightforward pre-
sentation. (The lengthy results from the binominal and mul-
tinomial logit models are available from the authors upon
request--the latter entail four coefficients for each variable
in each model.)
Table 2 presents OLS estimates for the cross-sectional
models with the two data sets. Model 1 for each data set
specifies the simple count of conditions as the morbidity in-
dicator along with the covariates. Model 2 specifies the sep-
arate summed variables for chronic (nonserious) and serious
conditions for the morbidity indicators. The fit of Model 2 is
superior to Model 1 in both data sets. The pattern of statisti-
cal significance for the covariates is similar in Models 1 and
2 for both data sets. As expected, each of the morbidity
measures in Model 2 is negatively related to self-rated
health, but the stronger effect in both samples is for serious
conditions. A test of the slope difference reveals that it is
statistically significant in both samples (t  9.64 for
NHEFS, t  11.35 for HRS; Gujarati, 1988). Chronic con-
ditions are associated with poorer health ratings, but serious
or life-threatening conditions are more consequential in
shaping health ratings. This conclusion was evident from
both the OLS analyses presented and from the multinomial
logistic regression analyses.
Model 3 for NHEFS uses the ICD codes to measure mor-
bidity (there are not enough diseases questioned in the HRS
to conduct the ICD analysis). Model 3 for NHEFS is also
superior to Model 1 and provides a slightly better fit than
Model 2. Eleven of the 14 ICD codes have significant nega-
tive relationships with self-rated health. Model 4, for both
the NHEFS and HRS, specifies the effect of the individual
binary variables for morbidity and has the highest R2 and
adjusted R2 values. (The improvement in model fit is statis-
tically significant even though the R2 increase is small. The
adjusted R2 difference between Models 1 and 4 is almost
3% in each sample, whereas the difference between Models
2 and 4 is about 1%, despite the increased number of vari-
ables in Model 4.) Eleven of the 35 diseases in NHEFS are
significant, whereas 14 of the 15 diseases in HRS are signif-
icant. As expected, all significant relationships for the indi-
vidual diseases are negative; morbidity is associated with
poorer health ratings. It is also worth noting that some of the
chronic conditions classified as nonserious significantly re-
duced health ratings (e.g., arthritis in both surveys, asthma

Generally, the effects due to the covariates are similar
across the models. A comparison of the covariates shows
that the values of the coefficients tend to decline across the
models, however, most coefficients maintain their level of
significance. There is one exception that should be noted. In
the cross-sectional models for the NHEFS, gender is signifi-
cant in Model 1 but not in Models 2­4.
Table 3 presents the parallel analyses for the longitudinal
models of self-rated health across both surveys. For NHEFS,
this is an approximate 10-year lag, whereas for HRS the lag
period is just 2 years. The simple count of conditions in
Model 1 is again quite significant in both samples. Model 2,
substituting the counts for chronic and serious conditions,
provides a better fit than Model 1 in both samples. As in the
cross-sectional models, serious illness is the stronger pre-
dictor of self-rated health (t  2.91 for NHEFS, t  3.37 for
HRS). Chronic illness leads to a decline in health ratings,
but the decline is steeper for those afflicted with serious ill-
ness. Model 3 for NHEFS specifies the ICD codes as the
morbidity measures. This model provides a better fit than
Model 1 but not Model 2. Although 11 of the 14 ICD codes
were significant in the cross-sectional equations, only three
of the 14 codes are significantly associated with change in
health ratings: respiratory system, digestive system, and
symptoms and ill-defined conditions.
Model 4 in both samples provides a slightly better fit than
any of the preceding longitudinal specifications, but the dif-
ferences in adjusted R2 values are trivial (less than 1%).
Only 2 of the 34 individual diseases in NHEFS (hyperten-
sion and gall stones) influenced change in self-rated health
over time, but 8 of the 15 diseases in HRS were significant
predictors of change in health ratings. The effects of the co-
variates are quite similar across the models in each data set,
and attrition did not significantly influence the estimates of
change in health ratings.
Three supplementary analyses were performed to exam-
ine more closely the relationships between the morbidity in-
dicators and self-rated health: a nominalization test for
thresholds, a reduced morbidity inventory with conditions
parallel across surveys, and tests for interactions of specific

diseases. These analyses are not presented in tables, but are
briefly summarized below. First, a nominalization test was
performed to identify possible thresholds or tip-points of the
effects of comorbidity on self-rated health (Cohen & Cohen,
1983). Beyond the effects due to the unique conditions
tested in the binary variable approach, separate dummy
variables representing each level of the simple count were
created to test the effects of comorbidity. In models for both
the NHEFS and HRS, with 0 serving as the reference group,
each higher level was significantly and negatively associ-
ated with self-rated health. The effects were fairly linear,
however. Although there does not appear to be any thresh-
old effect in these data, investigators who favor the binary
variable approach may find value in estimating threshold ef-
fects in models of other outcomes.
Second, whereas the number of conditions was not equiv-
alent across the surveys, the equations were re-estimated
with a reduced morbidity inventory that considered only the
conditions common to both surveys. The logic of such an
analysis is to make the analyses across the two surveys
more similar. Moreover, the results shown in Tables 2 and 3
indicate that many of the chronic (nonserious) conditions,

especially in the NHEFS, are not consequential to self-rated
health. Although deciding which conditions to include and
which to ignore is somewhat arbitrary, omitting disease in-
formation in the morbidity count variables would lead to an
underestimate of comorbidity. Thus, we compared the fit
statistics and R2 values from the results in Tables 2 and 3 to
parallel models that remove the conditions not found in both
surveys. In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analy-
ses, the models omitting the conditions unique to each sur-
vey provided significantly poorer fit and lower R2 values.
For the HRS, the model with all of the conditions included
added about 4% to the explained variance; the difference
was about 2% for the NHEFS. In general, these results show
the importance of including all of the available morbidity
information. We conclude that longer morbidity inventories
are worth the interview time to collect them and should be
used in multivariate models.
Third, given the recent work of Fried and colleagues
(1999), several disease interaction terms were tested in the
binary variable approach. The following product terms were
tested for both data sets: Heart Attack  Diabetes, Diabetes 
Kidney Disorder, Cancer  Emphysema, Arthritis  Hy-
pertension, and Heart Attack  Cancer. The first one was
significant in both data sets, and Arthritis  Hypertension
was also significant in the HRS. Thus, investigators may
want to consider testing for interaction terms that are theo-
retically meaningful to the analysis, especially when using
the binary variable approach.
Statistical Power
The analyses reported thus far for the binary variable ap-
proach indicate which diseases are significant in predicting
self-rated health. The presumption of such analyses is that
there is adequate statistical power to test such effects. That
is, it is presumed that if a binary disease variable is nonsig-
nificant, it is because it is inconsequential to the self-rated
health of respondents in the two surveys. This presumption,
however, may be inappropriate because of inadequate statis-
tical power for selected conditions, especially the relatively
rare ones. In this next section, we examine statistical power
in these surveys to further consider how it may influence the
selection of the most appropriate method for measuring
morbidity.
In Figure 1 we graphed hypothetical power calculations
for detecting differences in self-rated health among persons
with and without diabetes and hip fracture, respectively.
These conditions were chosen for this simulation because
they have different prevalence rates in the population while
providing different levels of self-rated health among those
who do and those who do not have the condition. Using the
mean differences from the NHEFS as the population param-
eters, in the figure we plotted three hypothetical power
curves for samples of 100, 500, and 1,000 across various
distributions of the disease. (For instance, the 5/95 split as-
sumes 5% of the sample has the condition and 95% does
not.) In Figure 1 we demonstrate that statistical power is a
function of (a) the difference between means (b) sample
size, and (c) the distribution of respondents in the sample
(i.e., percentage split) for those who do and do not have a
specific condition.
Power increases as the difference between means in-
creases, sample size increases, and the percentage split be-
comes more balanced. When the difference between the
group means is large, as it is for diabetes (Figure 1A), it is
almost certain that differences in self-rated health will be
detected unless the sample size is very small and the per-
centage split is highly skewed. On the other hand, compar-
ing Part A of Figure 1 to Part B demonstrates that as the dif-
ferences between the means in the population become
smaller, it becomes increasingly difficult to detect differ-
ences in self-rated health--particularly for conditions, such
as hip fracture, that have low prevalence rates. It is unlikely
that differences between respondents with and without the
rare conditions will be detected because the percentage split
is extremely skewed, even if a large nationally representa-
tive sample is used.
Returning to the comparison of morbidity measures in the
analyses of NHEFS and HRS presented above, it is now ap-
propriate to ask another question: Was there sufficient sta-
tistical power to detect differences for each of the conditions
considered in the models of self-rated health? Although
NHEFS and HRS are very large samples (over 6,800 and
5,637 cases used in these analyses, respectively), might sta-
tistical power be a problem in these or other large data sets
when using the binary variable approach?
In Table 4 we provide power calculations for all individ-
ual diseases as well as for the simple count of conditions

and the separate counts for serious and chronic conditions.
For the binary variables, power was calculated based on the
following formula for the noncentrality parameter from
Neter, Wasserman, and Kutner (1990):
(1)
where 1
and 2
represent the unadjusted mean self-rated
health among those who do and do not have a specific con-
dition,  is the standard deviation for self-rated health (as-
suming the same within-group ), and n1
and n2
are the
number of people with and without the condition.
For the count variables, the power calculation is based on
the following formula from Cohen (1988):
(2)
where r represents the correlation between the count vari-
able and self-rated health and n is the number of cases. (Ex-
amples of the SAS code used to generate the power values
are available from the authors upon request.)
The first column of Table 4 presents power for all respon-
dents in NHEFS and HRS. Using .80 as a criterion, it may
be seen that power is sufficient for the summed morbidity
variables. However, there is insufficient power for 13 of the
35 individual conditions that are represented in this NHEFS
sample. Over one-third of the binary variables do not have
sufficient power in the NHEFS data. By contrast, there is
adequate power for all of the individual conditions mea-
sured in the shorter disease inventory used in the HRS.
In the last four columns of Table 4 we present power cal-
culations for subsamples defined by gender and race. Re-
searchers often use subsamples of public data sets to focus
on better understanding health processes within selected
groups. Or, in the case of testing for statistical interactions,
researchers rely de facto on power in the subsample. Thus,
the data shown in the last four columns of Table 4 reveal the
impact on power when analyses are based on subsamples or
when interactions are tested by gender or race. Whereas the
HRS contains a Black oversample, power calculations for
HRS were completed on both the weighted and unweighted
data; the latter, reflecting the Black oversample, are re-
ported in Table 4.
Statistical power is excellent for all of the summed mor-
bidity variables in NHEFS and HRS subsamples. On the
other hand, statistical power is insufficient in a larger num-
ber of diseases for subsample analyses in NHEFS. For ex-
ample, among the subsample of men, power is insufficient
for 20 of the 35 conditions (57%), whereas for the female,
non-Black, and Black subsamples the number of conditions
with inadequate power is 12 (34%), 13 (37%), and 29
(83%), respectively. For the HRS sample of 5,637 cases, all
of the specific conditions have sufficient power, except the
fracture since age 45 condition in the Black subsample anal-
yses. This was also the case with the weighted data. For all
other conditions, results from the weighted and unweighted

data were very similar and showed that statistical power is
adequate.
Returning to our earlier question of sufficient statistical
power for all conditions in these data sets, one may answer
affirmatively for HRS but not for NHEFS. In retrospect, the
absence of a statistically significant effect in regression
models of self-rated health for many of the individual con-
ditions in NHEFS may have been due to inadequate power.
If a researcher were to use the binary variable approach for
NHEFS without calculating power, he or she would con-
clude (perhaps inappropriately) that many diseases are not
related to self-rated health in cross-sectional and longitudi-
nal analyses. In fact, it is quite possible that some of those
diseases influence self-rated health, but it is impossible to
detect such effects with the binary variable approach in
NHEFS. The problem is worse for subsample analyses or
when testing for interactions. For example, in the NHEFS, it
would be impossible to demonstrate that cancer affects
health ratings among men.
DISCUSSION
Four approaches for handling disease indicators were
considered here in cross-sectional and longitudinal models
of self-rated health. In the comparison between the most
common procedures--the simple count of diseases and the
binary variable approach--the latter provided better fitting
models in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of both
surveys. (This was also the case for a multinomial logistic
regression analysis or when dichotomizing self-rated health
and estimating binomial logistic regression models.) The bi-
nary variable approach is, therefore, appealing if one is will-
ing to accept a large number of independent variables
(Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993). Parsimony is not its strength,
but explanatory power and model fit are its primary advan-
tages. It is, of course, the only procedure for determining
whether a specific condition influences an outcome, and
even this is not possible for some conditions when question
wording lumps disparate diseases into one question (e.g.,
kidney or bladder problems in HRS).
Beyond the demand of handling a large number of inde-
pendent variables, statistical power may be the more serious
problem with the binary variable approach. Power is critical
to the conclusions derived from any sampling-based study.
It is clear from the above power analyses that the binary
variable approach may lead to the conclusion that a given
disease is not consequential to an outcome when, in fact, the
statistical chance for it to do so is small. Indeed, there was
insufficient statistical power for more than one-third of the
35 diseases available in the full NHEFS, and even more of
the diseases lacked sufficient statistical power when sub-
sample analyses by gender and race were considered. How-
ever, statistical power was not a problem for any of the vari-
ables based on the count of conditions.
Insufficient power may also be a concern in studies that
examine how special combinations of diseases may interact
in affecting health-related outcomes (i.e., interaction of dis-
eases). Fried and colleagues (1999) recently found such in-
teractive effects of diseases on disability in the Women's
Health and Aging Study. Given this, we performed statisti-
cal power calculations for several disease interactions for
MEASURING MORBIDITY S187
the NHEFS and HRS data. For both data sets, power was
calculated for interactions of (a) heart disease and diabetes
and (b) cancer and chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Power
was also estimated for the interaction of (a) diabetes and
kidney disorder in NHEFS and (b) diabetes and kidney or
bladder problem in HRS. There was sufficient power for all
interactions examined with the full sample. The only in-
stance in which power was insufficient was for cancer and
chronic bronchitis or emphysema in the Black subsample of
NHEFS. In short, investigators may find it valuable to cal-
culate power prior to specifying disease interactions, but
these analyses indicate that power is adequate in these data
for several common disease interactions.
It is plausible that there is no association between self-
rated health and food allergies, hay fever, and hives, but it is
impossible to determine if this is so from NHEFS. It may be
more difficult to presume that other conditions, which did
not manifest an association with self-rated health (e.g., tu-
berculosis, hepatitis, and psoriasis), are not consequential in
shaping health ratings. Or, would one genuinely believe that
cancer is not related to health ratings in a sample of men?
Whether any of these conditions influence health ratings is
an empirical question, but it cannot be answered in NHEFS
and probably not in many other data sets because of inade-
quate statistical power. The results of the analyses presented
here clearly show that investigators need to exercise caution
with the binary variable approach to be sure that there is ad-
equate statistical power for the proposed tests.
The conditions lacking adequate power in the NHEFS
full sample were not measured in HRS. Instead, HRS fo-
cused on those conditions for which the age group studied is
known to be at risk. Thus, the list itself is an important clue
to the appropriateness of the different approaches. For short
lists with prevalent conditions, the binary variable approach
may be preferred in large samples. For longer lists including
relatively rare conditions, caution should be exercised with
the binary variable approach--even with large samples.
Stated differently, the greater the specificity in the morbid-
ity listing, the greater the likelihood of a base-rate problem
for some conditions, resulting in insufficient power (Schmitt
& Colligan, 1984).
In models of self-rated health with the HRS, investigators
may proceed with the binary variable approach, but should
still exercise caution if testing interactions or estimating ef-
fects on other subsamples. It remains to be seen if the binary
variable approach is equally appropriate with other out-
comes in HRS or in other data sets.
ICD codes were considered as one alternative to the long
list of NHEFS conditions. Models based on ICD codes pos-
sessed better fit than those with the simple count of condi-
tions in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. This
fact and the widespread use of ICD codes in health services
research make them an attractive option. The raw ICD
codes are very specific nominal variables that may be useful
for some investigations, but most researchers aggregate
within bodily systems. As used here, ICD codes were
treated as counts that measure the number of conditions
within each ICD category. This approach classifies condi-
tions of related pathology and preserves variation in mor-
bidity within bodily systems, but alternative uses of ICD
codes may be appropriate in some investigations (Schwartz,
Iezzoni, Moskowitz, Ash, & Sawitz, 1996).
The other procedure examined for measuring morbidity
was based on separate counts of serious and chronic (nonse-
rious) conditions. In cross-sectional and longitudinal analy-
ses for both data sets, models using these variables provided
a better fit than did those with the simple count of condi-
tions, and power was always sufficient.
It is possible that one might use elements of more than
one of the approaches articulated above. For instance, on
some outcomes, it may be useful to consider a count of
chronic conditions, but separate binary variables for serious
illnesses (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, in press). This approach
would be less parsimonious than the two variables for seri-
ous and chronic illness, but more parsimonious than the bi-
nary variable approach. One would still need to be attentive
to the adequacy of statistical power for the binary variables
considered and to possible threshold effects for the count
variable, but this strategy may be optimal for certain re-
search questions. Indeed, a number of studies follow such a
strategy by focusing on the contribution of a single disease
to an outcome while using the other diseases as adjustments
(e.g., Parmelee et al., 1995). The conclusions from the
present analyses extend to that case as well: Test for the ad-
equacy of statistical power on the binary variables. If there
is insufficient statistical power for a single disease indicator,
the use of count variables preserves the comorbidity infor-
mation of the respondent for the analysis. It may be antici-
pated that the binary variable approach will yield more de-
tailed and slightly better fitting models, but the need for
parsimony may make count variables more appropriate for
certain research questions.
Measures of severity of illness represent another promis-
ing approach to assess the impact of morbidity on health
while distinguishing the more serious illnesses (Gonnella et
al., 1984; Knaus, Wagner, Zimmerman, & Draper, 1993;
Mulrow et al., 1994; Parmelee et al., 1995; Steen, Brewster,
Bradbury, Estabrook, & Young, 1993). Although different
severity of illness measures have been advanced, most rely
on hospital discharge abstracts or information from medical
records. An alternative is to ask respondents to distinguish
the most serious conditions. Regardless of the procedures
involved, most severity of illness measures would avoid the
problem of statistical power and, we suspect, provide better
fitting and insightful models than simple counts of disease.
Accurate estimates of the prevalence of morbidity across
the life course and assessments of how morbidity shapes
quality of life, health service use, and mortality are depen-
dent on how morbidity is measured. Although the differ-
ences in explained variance across the approaches are not
large in these analyses, the lowest R2 values (and poorest fit)
were routinely observed for the simple count of conditions.
The simple count may be useful in some research applica-
tions (Liang et al., 1990), but moving to separate counts for
serious and nonserious (chronic) conditions should be more
useful in many research projects while avoiding the risk of
inadequate statistical power associated with the binary vari-
able approach. If parsimony is not a major concern, then the
binary variable approach may be preferred. We urge investi-
gators, however, to test for statistical power when using the
S188 FERRARO AND WILMOTH
binary variable approach before concluding that rare condi-
tions do not affect the outcome. Failure to perform such
power tests may lead to an underestimate of the role of se-
lected diseases on health and longevity. It could be very
misleading for gerontologists to conclude that selected dis-
eases do not influence health-related quality of life, espe-
cially among frail elders, when inadequate statistical power
is responsible for the false-negative result. Finally, we urge
clinicians and policy officials to temper conclusions about
the lack of effects due to selected diseases in reported stud-
ies unless tests for statistical power have been performed.
