This paper examines the relationship between various types of child care during
the first year of a child's life and the child's language and social development
measured at age three. A unique contribution of the paper is the estimation of a
general selection-correction model that accounts for non-random selection of
children into different types of child care. The analysis uses data from the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a birth cohort of children born to
predominantly low-income single mothers. The results indicate that compared
with maternal care, relative care during infancy has more beneficial effects on a
child's language development, while day care centers have more beneficial effects
on a child's behavioral development.

1. Introduction
Non-maternal child care for infants and young children has increased rapidly over
the last few decades. Today, for the majority of young children in the United States,
child care has become an important part of their life before they enter kindergarten
or first grade. In 2002, 63% of children under age five were placed in some type of
non-maternal child care setting (US Census Bureau 2005). The increased use of
non-maternal care is most pronounced for children in their first year of life: most
infants were placed in some sort of non-maternal care by four months of age
(National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Early
Child Care Research Network (ECCRN) 1997). Major changes have also taken place
in the relative popularity of different types of child care. The use of relatives for child
care declined as parents began to rely more on family day care homes and day care
centers (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2003).
These significant changes in the use of child care have generated substantial
research interest in the effects of various types of child care, particularly in the
first year, on child development. Psychologists have suggested that the first year
of a child's life is crucial to child development, because of early influences on
brain development, learning skills, self-esteem and emotional security (Lewis and
Brooks-Gunn 1979; Harris 1983; Shore 1997). Prior research also finds that
children's early achievement is correlated with a variety of later life economic
outcomes, such as educational attainment and earnings (Currie and Thomas 2001;

Bernal and Keane 2006; Fronstin, Greenberg, and Robins 2006). Because of the link
between early child development and later life economic outcomes, the determinants
of early development have been receiving increasing attention in the economics
literature.
Understanding the effects of infant child care on child development is
particularly important in light of recent welfare reform and child care policies.
Under the current policy regime, large numbers of low-income single mothers who
formerly relied on government assistance are being pushed into the workforce. The
labor force participation rate of single mothers increased from 43.5% in 1990 to
53.5% in 2004 (US Census Bureau 2005). As a result, more children, including those
under one year of age, are being placed in non-maternal child care. In addition, child
care subsidies have increased substantially since welfare reform, in an effort to
facilitate greater labor force participation. Growth in child care subsidies has spurred
an even greater demand for non-maternal child care, especially center-based care
(Loeb et al. 2003). It is crucial to provide insights into the effects that these welfare
and child care policy changes have on the development of low-income children. If
mothers join the workforce and their children end up in a type of care that has
detrimental effects on their development, then pushing mothers to work may harm
the development of low-income children.
Although it is well documented that center-based early intervention programs,
such as Head Start, have positive effects on children's cognitive development (see
Currie 2001 for a review), research that compares the effects of different types
of child care has received less empirical attention, and has proven controversial.
A major challenge in estimating the effects of child care on child development is
accounting for non-random selection of children into different types of child care.
A mother's choice of child care may depend on some unobserved maternal and/or
child characteristics, which may also correlate with child outcomes. Most previous
studies fail to control for potential biases caused by the unobserved heterogeneity of
both mothers and children.
This paper examines the relationship between various types of child care during
the first year of a child's life and child language and social development at age three,
using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a birth
cohort of children born to predominantly low-income single mothers. Five types of
child care are considered: relative in a child's home, relative in another home, non-
relative/family day care home, day care center, and maternal care. The paper focuses
on two sets of questions: (1) `What are the differential effects of each type of infant
child care on child development?' and (2) `How do these effects vary by child's
gender and race?' The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
First, many existing studies on the effects of different types of child care include
only a small number of children from low-income families, making it difficult to
establish robust findings for these families. In addition, most previous studies use
data that predate the welfare reform policies of the 1990s. Evidence from these earlier
studies may not be applicable under the new policy regime. The FFCWS used in this
paper is a large representative sample of children born to predominantly low-income
single mothers between 1998 and 2000 in 20 US cities. Most of this sample is likely to
be affected by current welfare reform and child care policies. Findings from this
paper may fill gaps in our knowledge regarding the effects of early child care types on
2 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
the development of low-income children as their mothers move from welfare to the
workforce.
Second, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply a
general selection model (originally developed by Lee 1983) to address the potential
endogeneity of mother's choice of child care type on child development. Child care
choice is estimated using a multinomial logit model, with the inclusion of a mother's
eligibility for child care subsidy as an identifying instrument. This approach enables
us to detect the existence of selection bias and estimate the potential selection
effects for each type of child care. Moreover, this empirical strategy provides a useful
way of evaluating the child development impact of a child care subsidy through its
effect on child care choice.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of
the literature. Section 3 presents the conceptual framework and econometric model
used in the paper. Section 4 describes the data and provides summary statistics.
Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 discusses the findings and offers
our conclusions.
2. Previous literature
The effects of child care on child development have been widely studied in the
psychology, sociology, and economics literature. Most of these studies focus on
the effects of three aspects of early child care Á quality, quantity, and type of care
(see Love, Schochet, and Meckstroth 1996; Lamb 1998; National Research Council
and Institute of Medicine 2003; and Blau and Currie 2004 for a comprehensive
review). Studies of child care type have primarily focused on the effects of center care
or center-based early intervention programs, such as Head Start (see Currie 2001 for
a review). Although some studies have compared the effects of different types of care
on child development, research on the effects of infant child care has received less
empirical attention, and proven controversial, with researchers drawing different
conclusions about the patterns of the effects.
Studies of the effects of infant child care on child development
The majority of early studies in the developmental psychology literature that analyze
the effects of infant child care suffer from small sample sizes, few or no measures of
home environment, and no control for non-random selection of children into various
child care settings (Bayder and Brooks-Gunn 1991; Caughy, DiPietro, and Strobino
1994; Clarke-Stewart, Gruber, and Fitzgerald 1994).
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early
Child Care (NICHD-SECC), which is one of the better studies in this literature,
examines the effects of early child care on children's development for over 1300
children at 10 sites in the United States from birth in 1991 through age six. The study
contains rich data on child, family, and child care characteristics, which may reduce
the extent of the biases associated with omitted variables (NICHD ECCRN 1998,
2000, 2002). However, the NICHD-SECC sample is over-representative of children
from white, non-Hispanic families with high income and maternal education level,
and thus the results may not be applicable to children in lower-income and/or
minority families. Moreover, the studies do not examine whether the relationships
Journal of Children and Poverty 3
between different types of child care and cognitive outcomes vary by family income,
home environment, child gender, or race.
Developmental psychology theory suggests the potential detrimental impacts of a
mother's absence in the first year of a child's life for child cognitive and socio-
emotional development (Belsky 1988). However, the effects of non-maternal care
during infancy on child development are likely to vary by family's socio-economic
status. For low-income children, the environment provided by non-maternal care
may be more optimal than that which is provided by the home environment. If so,
non-maternal care during early childhood may serve as a protective factor to
promote the development of low-income children (Desai, Chase-Lansdale, and
Michael 1989; Caughy, DiPietro, and Strobino 1994). This explanation is consistent
with the `compensatory education' notion that children from low-income families
will obtain more benefits from high-quality non-maternal care than will children
from more advantaged families. Evidence from previous research on the protective
effects of non-maternal care for low-income children is inconclusive (Lamb 1997;
Ruhm 2004, 2005; Burchinal et al. 2000).
The effects of different types of child care on child development may vary by
child gender or race/ethnicity. First, there is a good deal of evidence that boys in
non-maternal care are at higher risk than girls in cognitive and behavioral
development (Bornstein et al. 2006; Zaslow and Hayes 1986; Langlois and Liben
2003). Second, there may be racial or ethnic differences in motherÁchild interactions
and/or in substitute care types, so the effects of child care on child development may
differ by racial or ethnic groups (Burchinal et al. 2000).
Many of the previous studies do not rigorously account for non-random
selection of children into different types of child care. A few recent studies consider
the possibility that mothers select child care types on the basis of unobserved
characteristics of mothers and children. Gamoran, Mare, and Bethke (1999) use data
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to analyze the effects
different types of care had on a child's verbal skills at age three and on math skills
measured between the ages of three and six. They address the selection bias by
estimating a mother fixed-effects model (within-family estimator), by exploiting the
fact that a large number of mothers in the NLSY have more than one child. The
mother fixed-effects method rules out both observed and unobserved variables that
do not change within a family, and therefore controls for possible bias caused by
unobserved heterogeneity of mothers. Blau (1999) adopts the same estimation
approach to examine the effects of various characteristics of child care including type
of care on a series of cognitive test scores and a behavioral problems index. This
model controls for a large number of background variables, including measures of
the quality of home environment.
Although mother fixed-effects estimates are free of bias caused by fixed
family-level unobserved heterogeneity, the potential bias caused by child-specific
unobserved heterogeneity or time-varying family-specific unobserved heterogeneity
cannot be controlled by this approach. The NICHD ECCRN and Duncan (2003)
uses the fact that cognitive test scores are measured in different years for a child to
estimate a child fixed-effects model (within-child estimator), which accounts for fixed
child-specific unobserved heterogeneity. One limitation of the child fixed-effects
estimation is that time-variant unobserved heterogeneity cannot be controlled,
4 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
though it is likely that the impact of the omitted variables vary over time. Moreover,
the study only analyzed the effects of center-based care.
Bernal and Keane (2006) is the only prior study that employs an instrumental
variables (IV) approach to examine effects of child care use on children's cognitive
development. They construct a comprehensive set of welfare policy variables at
individual and state levels and use them as instruments to estimate cognitive ability
function for children of single mothers from the NLSY.
Another common characteristic of the previous studies is that most of them use
data from the pre-welfare reform period. We know little about the type of child care
selected under the new policy regime by mothers moving from welfare to work, and
the effects of these types on their young children's development. One recent study by
Loeb et al. (2003) investigates the developmental effects of child care type and
quality in poor communities in three major US cities, by following a group of
children age 12Á42 months (N0451) when their mothers entered welfare-to-work
programs. However, due to a non-representative sample, generalizing their results to
the national population of low-income families is difficult.
A certain type of child care can affect a child's development through the quantity
of time the child spends in that type, and the quality of that type. A substantial body
of research has found that higher-quality care is significantly associated with better
child development, and the quality of care is related to the structural features of the
child care settings including childÁadult ratio, group size, caregivers' specialized
training and formal education level (Blau 2001; Love, Schochet, and Meckstroth
1996; Lamb 1998; NICHD ECCRN 1996, 2000). Quality measures of the different
types of child care are not available in the FFCWS. Thus, the reader should keep in
mind that the differential effects by child care type estimated in this study may reflect
varying quality of those settings in addition to other factors.
Child care choice
There is a large body of literature examining the effects of child care prices on either
the employment or child care choice decisions of mothers with young children. Some
studies model the choice of child care conditional on the mother working based on
the assumption that her employment decision is exogenous to the child care choice
decision (Hofferth and Wissoker 1992; Cleveland and Hyatt 1993; Hagy 1998).
Chaplin et al. (1999) and Connelly and Kimmel (2003) account for the potential
endogeneity of mother's employment in the demand for child care by including
predicted employment status in their demand models. A few studies jointly examine
mother's labor supply decision and child care choice decision (Blau and Hagy 1998;
Powell 2002; Michalopoulos and Robins 2000, 2002). The majority of the studies on
the demand for child care use a multinomial logit model with categories defined by
type of care or by cross-classifying employment status with child care modes. The
price of child care is typically the predicted value from an estimated parent-reported
hourly child care expenditure equation, corrected for selectivity on paying for care.1
Researchers have used child care regulations, average wages of child care workers,
and other factors that vary across geographic locations as identifying variables. One
problem with this approach is that, if a family chooses the quality of care, it becomes
impossible to find justifiable exclusion restrictions to identify the selection effects
(Blau and Currie 2004). To avoid the difficult problem of estimating the price of child
Journal of Children and Poverty 5
care in a structural model, this paper follows Blau and Tekin (2003) and Tekin (2004)
by estimating a reduced-form model in which the determinants of child care prices,
including household characteristics and child care subsidies, are substituted into the
demand model.
Prior research has found evidence on the impacts of child care subsidies on a
mother's choice of child care types (Michalopoulos and Robins 2000, 2002; Blau
2000; Tekin 2002, 2004). Some of these studies use data prior to the most recent
welfare reform while others use data during the early post-welfare reform period.
The empirical evidence from these studies suggests that it might be fruitful to use a
mother's eligibility for a child care subsidy or a hypothetical subsidy amount a
mother would receive, if eligible, as an instrument to identify the effects of child care
types on child development.
Although there is a large body of research on the overall effects of child care in
the pre-school years on child outcomes, the important question of what types of
early child care can be most helpful for children from different socioeconomic
backgrounds has received limited attention. In the remainder of this paper, we
estimate a model of the effects of various types of infant child care on child
development outcomes using data on children born after the most recent welfare
reform. A large proportion of children in our study sample are from social-
economically disadvantaged families, a group that has been less studied in prior
research and are likely to be affected more than higher-income families by current
welfare reform and child care policies. To account for non-random selection of
families into different types of child care, we use a general selection-correction
model, which has not been applied in previous studies.
3. Conceptual framework and econometric model
In economic models, the households are assumed to maximize a utility function that
includes child outcomes as one argument, subject to a budget constraint and a
production function of child outcomes (Becker 1991; Ruhm 2005). Our goal is to
estimate an early child development production function, which is a cumulative
process depending on the history of inputs applied by families and other care types,
as well as on children's inherited endowments (Todd and Wolpin 2003). Consider a
production function of development outcomes for child i at age t (Yit
) as
Yit
0Yt
[Hi
(t); Ci
(t); m
i
; o
i
(t)]; (1)
where H is a vector of family inputs, C is a vector of child care inputs, Hi
(t) and Ci
(t)
are the vectors of their respective input histories up to child i's age t, mi
is child i's
endowment, and oi
(t) is a vector of disturbance terms capturing production shocks
not otherwise controlled for. Child outcomes depend on both the quantity and
quality of family and child care inputs (Blau 1999; James-Burdumy 2005). Because
we lack quality measures of the various types of non-maternal child care, the effects
we estimate may be partially reflecting varying quality of care in addition to other
factors.
Our empirical specification relates the effects of child care type during the first
year of a child's life to child development outcomes at age three, controlling for the
changes in child care type between the first and third year and other determinants of
child development. Controlling for changes in child care type is important because
6 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
previous studies find that instability in early child care is negatively associated with
child social development (NICHD ECCRN 1998).
The empirical model is as follows:
Yi
0a'gCi
'uIi
'bXi
'ei
; (2)
where Yi
is a measure of child i's development outcome at age three, Ci
is a vector
of type of child care at age one, Ii
is a binary variable indicating whether child
i experienced any change in child care type between age one and age three, and Xi
is a vector of family and child characteristics that are thought to affect child
development.
A causal interpretation can only be applied to the parameter estimates on child
care type if X controls for all other determinants of child outcomes. However, even
an extensive set of explanatory variables in X may not fully account for all of the
important sources of heterogeneity in family or child characteristics. If mothers
choose a child care type based on some unobserved maternal or child characteristics,
which are also correlated to the outcomes, then estimates that do not account for
unobserved heterogeneity would be biased. For example, mothers' unobserved
child-rearing attitudes may not only play a role in their child care choice, but may
also directly affect child development. In this case, the error term would be correlated
with child care type, i.e., cov(ei
,Ci
)"0, which will produce biased results.
The estimation procedure accounts for non-random selection into different child
care types in two steps. First, an ordinary least squares (OLS) model is used with the
inclusion of a rich set of explanatory variables that reflect differences among families
using different child care types. Second, a multinomial logit-OLS two-stage
estimation model, originally developed by Lee (1983), is applied to control for the
possible selection bias of child care choice. Lee's model extends the classical
Heckman's probit-OLS two-step estimator (also known as Heckit) to a multinomial
logit-OLS (mlogit-OLS) two-step estimator to allow selection correction for
polychotomous choices, i.e., individuals have more than two alternatives. For its
ability to correct selection in polychotomous choices and computational ease, Lee's
mlogit-OLS two-step estimation framework has been widely used in empirical
studies on sample and self-selection in polychotomous choice models (Gyourko and
Tracy 1988; Brewer, Eide, and Ehrenberg 1999; Zhang 2004). However, to our
knowledge, this paper is the first application of such a generalized selection model to
analyze the effects of child care type on child development.
The multinomial logit-OLS model is estimated in two stages. In the first stage,
child care choice is estimated by a multinomial logit model. Then the correction
terms of variables correlated with child care choice are calculated and included in the
second-stage child outcome equations, which are estimated by OLS for each type of
child care. The results are then used to calculate the difference in child development
outcomes between one type of non-maternal care and maternal care. Full details of
the estimation procedure are presented in Appendix 1.
4. Data
FFCWS data
To estimate the model, we use data from the FFCWS and its associated In-Home
module. The FFCWS follows a cohort of 4898 children born in 20 US cities with
Journal of Children and Poverty 7
populations of 200,000 or more between 1998 and 2000, and includes an over-sample
of non-marital births.2 The sample is both racially and ethnically diverse (51% of the
sample is African-American and 22% is Hispanic), and includes large numbers of
children from low-income families (33% had incomes below 100% of the poverty line
at birth, with another 26% with incomes between 100 and 200% of the poverty line).
The core study consists of interviews with both mothers and fathers at the time
of child's birth and again when the focal child is one (N04271) and three years
old (N04140). The parent interviews collected information on child care along
with other detailed information on family characteristics, parent relationships,
parenting behavior, economic and employment status. At age three, the child's
primary caregiver participated in an additional In-Home Assessment (the 36-Month
In-Home Longitudinal Study of Pre-School Aged Children), which is composed of
two parts: a parent survey questionnaire and an activity booklet. The parent survey
questionnaire covers a broad range of topics on child's health, child's behavior
problems, parenting, and home environment. The activity booklet is used to
record the mother and child's Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores and
observations about the child's home environment, child's behavior, and parentÁchild
interaction. More than 79% of the respondents of the 36-month Core survey
participated in the 36-Month In-Home module (N03288). The main sample used
for this paper consists of children whose families completed the In-Home
Assessment and for whom we have key information of child care types that can
be identified at age one. Sample sizes range from 2312 to 2986 depending upon the
extent to which there were missing values for each child outcome.3
Variables analyzed
Child development outcomes
The outcomes we analyze are measures of language and social development at age
three. They include the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) score, and two
behavior problem indices. All development outcomes are measured at the 36-Month
In-Home Study. The PPVT is a widely-used measure of receptive vocabulary that
measures the size and range of words that the respondent understands (Berger,
Paxson, and Walfogel 2005; Ruhm 2005). Evidence shows that PPVT scores in
early childhood correlate with literacy outcomes in young adulthood (Bayder,
Brooks-Gunn, and Furstenberg 1993). We focus on the age-standardized PPVT
scores, which have been commonly used by previous researchers (Bayder and
Brooks-Gunn 1991; Blau 1999; Ruhm 2004). The standardized PPVT on a national
sample has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In our sample, the mean is
86.7, which is lower than 100, since the FFCWS sample tends to over-represent
children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The age-standardized TVIP (Test de
Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody) scores are used for Spanish-speaking children.
The two behavior problems variables measure internalizing and externalizing
child behavior problems. The internalizing (anxious/depressed and withdrawn) and
externalizing (aggressive and destructive) child behavior problems are based on items
from the Achenbach 1992 Child Behavior Checklists for two- to three-year-olds
(CBCL/2Á3). Achenbach's CBCL are widely used scales for assessing problematic
behaviors for preschoolers and older children (NICHD ECCRN 1998, 2002) and
8 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
have been shown to be predictive of outcomes in later childhood (Achenbach,
Edelbrock, and Howell 1987; Shaw et al. 1998). Items were read to each mother, who
was asked to indicate whether the statement was not true (0), sometimes or
somewhat true (1), or very true or often true of her child (2). Scores for each measure
of child behavior problems are calculated by averaging item scores. In this study, the
internalizing scale consists of the mean responses of 24 items, with a mean of 0.40
and standard deviation of 0.24. The externalizing scale consists of the mean
responses of 22 items, with a mean of 0.62 and standard deviation of 0.36. The
Cronbach's alpha is 0.81 for the internalizing scale and 0.88 for the externalizing
scale. For ease of interpretation, all child outcomes have been normalized to
have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so that the regression coefficients can be
interpreted as the standard deviation change in the outcome predicted by a one unit
change in the explanatory variable.
Types of child care
The key explanatory variable in this paper is the type of child care. When the child
was age one, the parent was interviewed about the current child care types being
used. Non-maternal care is defined as the care of a child by someone other than the
child's mother for at least 10 hours a week on a regular basis. Most previous child
care studies only analyze working women. However, non-maternal child care is also
used by many non-working mothers.4 In this paper, 18% of non-working mothers
and 62% of working mothers used some type of non-maternal care for their children
at age one. Therefore, children with both working and non-working mothers are
included in the analysis sample. The choice of child care type is classified as: (1)
relative5 in child's home, (2) relative in another home, (3) non-relative6/family day
care home, (4) day care center (including Head Start/Early Head Start), and (5)
maternal care. Relative care and non-relative care in the child's home or in another
home are considered as home-based care or informal child care types, while day care
center is considered a formal child care type. For children in multiple child care
settings, the type of care in which the child spends the most time is considered
primary. Children not receiving regular non-maternal care were grouped into the
category of maternal care. At age one, 42% of the children were regularly receiving
non-maternal child care. Relative care in another home and day care center were
used most often, with 14% each. Relative care in the child's home accounted for 8%.
Only 6% of the children were cared for by non-relatives/family day care at home. A
dichotomous scale indicating whether the child has ever experienced any changes in
child care type is used to measure instability in child care between age one and three.
Control variables
To capture the influences of family inputs and child endowments on child
development, as suggested by the economic model, we exploit the extensive child,
maternal and household information available in the FFCWS. First, a vector of
parent and child background variables is included, which has been widely used in the
previous literature. Child background characteristics include the child's age (in
months, at the time of the In-Home assessment), gender, birth order, and whether the
child's birth weight was low (less than 2500 g). Parental background characteristics
Journal of Children and Poverty 9
include the ages of the mother and father at the child's birth, mother's race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other), whether the
father's race is different from the mother's, and the mother's immigrant status.
Second, to control further for the family's socioeconomic status, each parent's
educational attainment (less than high school, high school diploma, some college or
technical training, and college or more), mother's score on the PPVT,7 and the
logarithm of average household income between the child's first and third years of
life are included. Each parent's work status and weekly hours worked when the child
was one and three are also included to account for parental time investment on the
child. A parent's work status and hours of work can also affect a mother's choice of
child care type. Mother's employment would be potentially endogenous in both
stages of estimation, if the mother decided the choice of child care and labor force
participation simultaneously. It is difficult to find proper instruments to control for
the potential endogeneity of mother's employment. Therefore, this paper assumes
that the mother's employment decision is exogenous to the child care choice
decision.8 Moreover, the number of adults and the number of children by age in the
household and the mother's marital status (married at birth and age three, not
married at birth or age three, only married at birth, only married at age three) are
included.
Third, we control for parental health and health behavior that may affect a
parent's ability to care for the child. The mother's overall health status is defined on
the basis of her self-assessment of health at the child's birth. A dichotomous scale is
created for poor/fair health versus good/very good/excellent health. The three
maternal health behavior variables include dichotomous measures of the mother's
report of smoking, drinking, and drug use at child's birth. We control for the father's
health using three dichotomous measures: having any physical or mental health
condition that limits his ability to work, smoking, and having problems keeping a job
or holding relationships because of alcohol or drug use at child's birth.
Fourth, to control for the quality of the home environment, we include several
measures of parenting behavior and a measure of household food security (from
the USDA scale9). All of these measures are from the 36-Month In-Home Study. We
use five measures of parenting behavior and motherÁchild interaction. Four of
these are derived from the infant-toddler version of the Home Observation for
Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory (Bradley 1993), and include
emotionally responsive, not punitive, verbal/social skill, and language stimulation.
The scale of each measure is generated using the mean responses of the items
included, such as parent responded verbally to child's vocalizations, parent did not
shout at child, parent's speech was distinct and audible, and parent provided books
for child. The Cronbach's alpha is 0.74 for emotionally responsive, 0.76 for not
punitive, 0.69 for verbal/social skill, and 0.53 for language stimulation.
The fifth measure of parenting behavior is based on the `Neglect' subscale from
the Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS) (Straus et al. 1998). Since most mothers did
not report any neglectful behaviors at all, this measure is coded as a binary
variable indicating whether any of the neglectful behaviors occurred in the past year.
The measure of food security reflects home income and the priority of food
expenditure at home. Since few mothers admitted food insecurity, this measure is
coded as a binary indicator of whether food insecurity exists in the household.

Finally, we control for several additional background characteristics, including
whether the mother had been on welfare prior to the child's birth, whether she lived
with both parents at age 15, and whether the mother's father was involved in her
life while she was growing up. Other factors included the education level of the
mother's parents and city dummies that control for city-specific differences. For each
explanatory variable with missing values, we also include in the model to be
estimated a dummy variable equaling 1 whenever the explanatory variable has a
missing value, and 0 otherwise. The explanatory variables with missing values are set
equal to 0.10
Instruments
To identify a mother's choice of child care type, her eligibility for a child care subsidy
under the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is included as an instrument
in the choice equation.11 A mother's potential eligibility for a child care subsidy is
constructed based on two criteria under state rules: family income and parental work
status (US Administration for Children and Families 2001). First, a family must have
monthly income below the income eligibility threshold for a family of the same
size established by the state of residence. We compared the household's monthly
income to the appropriate income threshold for the same household size to
determine income eligibility. Most states set income eligibility limits substantially
below the level by law, 85% of the state median income (SMI). Three states set the
income eligibility limit at less than 50% of SMI. When measuring the household's
monthly income, we take account of the variation in definitions of income used by
the states. For example, some states do not count income from Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or
food stamps in their determination of CCDF eligibility. Second, both the mother and
the father (if there is a spouse present) must be either working or attending a job
training or educational program. Three states require the parent to work at least a
minimum number of hours per week (e.g., 20 hours) to be eligible for CCDF
subsidies. Other states do not require minimum hours of work. If these two criteria
are satisfied, then the mother is eligible for a child care subsidy in this paper. About
34% of the mothers in the sample are estimated to be eligible for a CCDF subsidy at
child's age one. Among them, 27% actually received child care subsidies. The US
Administration for Children and Families (2000) predicts that about 12Á15% of all
eligible families received a CCDF subsidy in 1998Á2000. However, the national figure
includes all children under age 13, while this study includes only children at age one.
Since younger children are more likely to receive child care subsidies, and children
from low-income families are served at a higher percentage, the eligibility estimates
in this study are reasonable.
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables by child care type at age one.
Using the sample of children exclusively in maternal care as the reference group,
Table 1 also reports the results from t-tests on the equality of sample means across
child-care types.12 Children in non-maternal care, except for relative care in the
child's home, are reported to exhibit less internalizing behavior problems than

children in maternal care. The internalizing scale is the lowest for children in day
care centers. The same pattern is found with respect to children's PPVT scores,
although the differences in the means are not statistically significant. Children in
relative care in another home or day care centers at age one are reported to have
less externalizing problems at age three. The differences, however, are also not
statistically significant.
The child care turnover rate is highest for children in non-relative/family day
care (FDCH) home at age one, with 78% of mothers reporting having switched to
another type of care by age three. Center care seems to be the most stable type of
care during the first three years. Among those mothers who used center care at
child's age one, only one-third changed to another type of care at child's age three.
Compared to mothers who chose maternal care in the first year, mothers who
chose any non-maternal care types, on average, are more likely to be better
educated, employed, and have higher household income. At the same time, they are
less likely to be continuously married, to be in poor health, to be on welfare prior
to child's birth, and to have more children under age five. In addition, young
parents are more likely to choose relative care in the first year. Black mothers are
more likely to choose day care centers or relative care in another home, while
Hispanic mothers or mothers born outside the United States are less likely to
choose these two types. Mothers who chose center care at age one are more likely
to be good at parenting skills than mothers who chose any other child care types.
Finally, mothers who used any type of non-maternal care are more likely to be
eligible for a child care subsidy. For example, 64% of mothers who chose day care
centers are eligible for a child care subsidy, compared with 24% of mothers who
used maternal care.
5. Results
The estimation results from the OLS model are discussed first, followed by the
results from the multinomial logit-OLS two-stage model accounting for the potential
selection bias. Finally, the differences in child development outcomes between one
type of non-maternal care and maternal care are calculated based on the selection
model estimates, and are compared to the OLS results.
OLS estimates
The simplest way to analyze the effects of child care types on child development
outcomes is to estimate Equation (2) by OLS, in which dummy variables are included
indicating the various types of child care used. Three child outcome measures are
regressed separately on a rich set of child and family characteristics and city
dummies. Results from OLS regressions are shown in Table 2.13 Children show less
internalizing behavior problems in center care, and more externalizing behavior
problems in non-relative/FDCH. Compared to the reference category of maternal
care, center care is associated with a 0.095 standard deviation decline in the
internalizing scale, while non-relative/FDCH is associated with a 0.192 standard
deviation rise in the externalizing scale. Non-relative/FDCH is associated with a
lower PPVT score, but the effect is not statistically significant.
16 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
Selection model estimates
As discussed above, the OLS estimates are potentially subject to bias due to the
omission of unobserved variables correlated with child care choice. Therefore, a
multinomial logit-OLS two-stage estimation model is adopted to address the
potential selection bias. The framework involves the estimation of a reduced-form
multinomial logit child care choice model, calculation of correction terms of
variables correlated with child care choice from this model, and the inclusion of these
correction terms in the child development outcome equations estimated separately
for each type of child care.
Reduced-form multinomial logit child care choice model
In estimating the multinomial choice model [Equation (A.6) in Appendix 1],
variables are included in the z vector that are believed to be important in a mother's
child care decision. These variables include child and parent background character-
istics, parent's education, household income, number of household members, work
status and hours of work of each parent, marital status of the mother, parents'
health, additional background characteristics, city dummies that account for
city-specific differences in the stock of child care options available, and average
price of care. Mother's eligibility for a child care subsidy is also included to help
identify the choice equation. It must be noted that a structural choice model would
normally include the price of each type of child care. However, because price effects
are not the focus of this paper, the model estimated can be thought of as a reduced
form model in which the determinants of child care prices are substituted into the
choice equation (see, for example, Blau and Tekin 2003; Tekin 2004).

The implied marginal effect of each variable on the probability of selecting each
child care type is given in Table 3.14 Most of the results from this first-stage equation
are consistent with the findings of previous studies (see Blau and Currie 2004, for a
review). Black children have a 5% higher probability than white children of being in
center care, primarily because black American mothers are much more likely to work
full time (Michalopoulos and Robins 2000). Foreign-born mothers are less likely to
use day care centers. Mother's education appears to be an important factor
explaining the choice of child care. Increased levels of mother's education raise the
probability of a child being in non-relative/FDCH and reduce the probability of
being in maternal care. Graduating from college, for example, reduces a mother's
chance of selecting maternal care by 16%. As expected, a mother's work status has a
significant effect on her use of non-maternal care. Being employed reduces mother's
chance of choosing maternal care by 38%. A mother's hours of work are also
significantly related to her choice of child care mode. However, the effects tend to be
small. The presence of another adult in the household has a significant positive
impact on the probability of using relative care in home, and the presence of young
children significantly increases the probability of using maternal care. Being single
reduces a mother's chance of choosing maternal care by 17% and increases her
chance of selecting relative care in her home by 7%. Children from families who had
been on welfare (TANF) prior to the child's birth have a 6% higher probability of
being in maternal care.
Mother's eligibility for a child care subsidy (the identifying instrument in the first
stage) is a significant determinant of child care choice. Eligibility for a subsidy raises
the probability that the child is in center care, a family day care home, and in-home
relative care by 19, 3, and 3%, respectively, while it reduces the probability that the
child is in maternal care by 24%. This result is consistent with the findings in prior
research that child care subsidies increase the use of non-maternal care, especially
day care centers (Tekin 2004). In order to provide further evidence on the validity of
the instrument, subsidy eligibility is included in the second-stage outcome equations,
and none of the coefficients are found to be significant.
An assumption of the multinomial logit model is that the choice categories for
the model have the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). The IIA
property assumes that the inclusion or exclusion of the choice does not affect the
relative probabilities of choosing any two remaining options. In other words, the
IIA assumption implies the error terms, hij
s, are independent across alternatives. To
examine the validity of the IIA assumption, the Hausman test (Hausman and
McFadden 1984) is performed. The Hausman test indicates that the IIA assumption
cannot be rejected for each of the four choice equations. Hence, on the basis of this
test, use of the multinomial logit model in the first stage is justified.
Child development outcome equations
Estimates of the three second-stage child development outcome equations in the
second stage are presented in Tables 4Á6. Because these outcome equations are
estimated separately for each type of child care, they have the advantage of not
constraining the coefficients of the control variables to be the same across child care
types. The Wald test is employed to test the equality of the coefficients between any
type of non-maternal care and maternal care in each of the three child development

test indicates that equality constraints are not binding in all three outcome
equations.
One objective of this paper is to explore variations in the effects of child care type
by child gender and race. Significant racial variation is only observed in the models
of children's PPVT scores. The results indicate that black or Hispanic children suffer
a significant cognitive disadvantage in maternal and in-home relative care. For
example, compared with white children, black and Hispanic children are 0.879 and
0.999 standard deviations lower in PPVT performance if cared for by relatives at
home. With respect to differential effects by child gender, the results indicate that
boys generally suffer a developmental disadvantage in all care types in the first year.
However, for children's language development, significant variations by gender are
only found in maternal care, and for children's externalizing behavioral development,
significant gender variations are shown in center care and in-home relative care.
There is no evidence that the cognitive effects of different types of non-maternal care
are significantly greater for boys than for girls.
Consistent with prior research, family and child characteristics and measures of
home environment are found to play an important role in child development. In
the models of children's PPVT scores, mother's PPVT score has a significant and
positive effect in four out of the five types. Even after controlling for the mother's
cognitive ability, having a college degree still exerts a large positive effect on a child's
cognitive development in non-relative/FDCH and maternal care. Previous studies
have found that highly educated mothers devote more time with their children to
activities which are particularly beneficial for the children's cognitive development,
for example, reading to the children rather than watching television with them
(Bianchi et al. 2004). In the models of children's behavior problems, center care is
significantly more beneficial than maternal care for high-income children in their
internalizing behavioral development. Children from immigrant families enjoy an
advantage in in-home relative care. Mother's parenting skills have significant effects
on children's behavioral development. For example, non-punitive behavior is
associated with less internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, while neglect
behavior is related to more behavior problems. Finally, a change in child care type
between age one and age three only has significant impacts on the language
development of children in maternal care in the first year. Children who are cared for
by their mothers at age one achieve higher PPVT scores when they are placed in non-
maternal child care at age three, compared with children persistently receiving
maternal care. This result is consistent with prior research that finds beneficial effects
of non-maternal care at age three on children's cognitive development (NICHD
ECCRN 2000; Loeb et al. 2003).
The extent of a child's nonrandom selection into each child care type is indicated
by the estimated coefficients on the selectivity terms ls.15 No evidence of selection
bias is found in the models of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior
problems. In the model of children's PPVT scores, the selectivity coefficients are
statistically significant and negative in non-relative/FDCH and maternal care, which
imply a positive selection into these two types. Children selected into non-relative/
FDCH have on average a 2.287 standard deviation increase in PPVT scores relative
to a child drawn at random with identical observable characteristics would be
expected to have in that type.16 One potential explanation for this nonrandom
34 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
selection is that mothers with more developmentally advantaged children are more
likely to use non-relative care, such as FDCH or center care. By contrast, if children
are less able or developmentally challenged in the first year, mothers may trust
relative care more than non-relative care. If mother's use of non-relative/FDCH is
correlated with some unobserved child developmental or health characteristics, not
accounting for the selection effects will lead to biased findings. The results suggest a
negative selection into relative care and a positive selection into center care, although
the selection effects are not statistically significant. The positive selection is also
significant for maternal care. Children selected into maternal care have on average
0.157 standard deviation rise in PPVT scores than an `identical' randomly selected
child would have in that type. One possible explanation for this positive selection is
that mothers who hold traditional childrearing beliefs, and who are willing to devote
more time with their children, are likely to choose exclusive maternal care. The
presence of selection effects in the model of children's PPVT scores suggests that
the OLS estimates are biased due to the omission of unobserved mother or child
characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to employ the generalized two-stage
selection model to adequately control for the endogeneity of a mother's choice of
child care.
Child development outcome differentials
Following the standard practice in selection models of calculating the differentials of
child outcomes of one type of non-maternal care relative to maternal care on the
basis of the selection model estimates (Maddala 1983; Trost and Lee 1984; Main and
Reilly 1993), the measure of child development outcome differential is given by:
Dy(j; k)0E[yi
(j)(yi
(k)]0E[E[yi
(j)(yi
(k)½xi

k, respectively, ^
b
j
and ^
b

are the coefficient estimates from the general selection
model, and ¯
x is a vector of sample means of the explanatory variables.
Given unbiased estimates of bj
and bk
, the child development outcome
differential17 reflects the true varying effects of types of child care on child
development outcomes. The differential corresponds to an experiment in which a
child, having observable characteristics that are the same as the average child in
the sample, is taken at random from the population. The differential indicates the
expected difference in the outcomes that this child would have obtained in one type
of non-maternal care relative to maternal care. Table 7 reports the differentials for
each of the three child development outcomes.
First, focus on the PPVT differentials listed under column 2 in Table 7.
Compared to maternal care in a child's first year of life, relative care in a child's
home and relative care in another home are associated with a 0.43 standard deviation
rise in PPVT scores. By contrast, non-relative/FDCH is associated with a 2.053
standard deviation reduction in PPVT scores compared to maternal care. There is no
significant difference between first-year center care and maternal care in their effects
on children's PPVT scores.
Journal of Children and Poverty 35
The patterns of the effects suggested by the child development outcome
differentials are in sharp contrast to those indicated by the OLS estimates. Because
there are no appreciable selection effects for relative care, but a positive selection
effect for maternal care, the OLS results underestimate the effects of relative care
compared with maternal care. After controlling for selection bias, relative care is
found to be significantly more beneficial than maternal care for children's language
development. Second, the positive selection effect for non-relative/FDCH is much
higher than that for maternal care. Therefore, after accounting for self-selection of
children into these two child care types, the detrimental impact of non-relative/
FDCH becomes significant and relatively large in magnitude.
The internalizing and externalizing differentials are shown under columns 3 and
4 of Table 7. Center care is more beneficial than maternal care in the first year for
children's behavioral development. Compared to maternal care, center care is
associated with 0.379 and 0.138 standard deviation declines in internalizing
and externalizing scales, respectively. The differentials also indicate a detrimental
effect of relative care in the first year on children's behavioral development. For
example, relative care in the child's home is associated with 0.496 and 0.123 standard
deviation increases in internalizing and externalizing scales, compared to maternal
care. Non-relative/FDCH is also found to be significantly associated with more
externalizing behaviors than maternal care at child's age one. Note that, despite the
absence of significant selection effects in the models of children's behavior problems,
there is still a difference between OLS estimates and the child development outcome
differentials.18 However, both results indicate significantly beneficial effects of
center-based care on children's internalizing behavioral development, and signifi-
cantly the detrimental impact of non-relatives/FDCH on children's externalizing
behavioral development.
6. Conclusions
Overall, the findings of this study suggest that in low-income families, non-maternal
care during the first year of a child's life may be more beneficial developmentally

than maternal care. This is consistent with the `compensatory education' hypothesis
proposed in prior research that non-maternal care may serve as a protective factor
for poor children with developmental risk (Desai, Chase-Lansdale, and Michael
1989). Relative care is found to be more beneficial than maternal care in the first year
for children's language development. We find no significant difference between center
care and maternal care in their effects on children's PPVT scores, consistent with the
findings of Bernal and Keane (2006), but in contrast to other studies that find
positive effects of day care centers on the language and cognitive development of
low-income children (Loeb et al. 2003; Bradley and Lowe Vandell 2007).
With regard to children's social development, our results indicate that center-
based care is more beneficial than maternal care during the first year. This contrasts
with the findings of several studies in the developmental psychological literature that
suggests early non-maternal care is associated with elevated risks of insecure parentÁ
child attachments and the development of aggression, noncompliance, and behavior
problems (Belsky 1988, 2001; NICHD ECCRN 2002). However, a large number of
children in our study are from economically disadvantaged families and previous
research has found that the quality of center-based care serving low-income children
can be moderate to high, at least along structural indices, such as staffÁchild ratios
(Phillips et al. 1994). Therefore, children from low-income families may benefit from
high-quality center-based care in their social development while children from
higher-income families may not.
The advantages of center-based care may arise for several reasons. First, children
in centers have greater opportunities to interact with peers. Prior research has
found that more experience with groups of children is related to less behavior
problems and more cooperative functioning (Clarke-Stewart, Gruber, and Fitzgerald
1994; NICHD ECCRN 1998). Second, caregivers in centers tend to hold non-
authoritarian childrearing beliefs (child-centered), which lead them to have more
positive interactions with infants, and to be more likely to foster children's
explorations than do caregivers with authoritarian beliefs, such as fathers and
grandparents (NICHD ECCRN 1998, 2000). Third, recent research has found that
caregivers' education is a strong predictor of children's social development (Loeb
et al. 2003), and center caregivers typically have higher levels of education. Because
quality measures of the various child care types are not available in the FFCWS, it is
not clear what characteristics of center-based care are more supportive of children's
behavioral development than home-based care. Further analysis along the lines
pursued here is needed using data sets where quality measures of various child care
types are available in addition to data on early child development.19
We also find variations in the effects of child care type by the child's gender and
race-ethnicity. Center-based care has larger beneficial effects on externalizing
behavioral development for girls than for boys. Black and Hispanic children suffer
significant and large cognitive disadvantages from receiving in-home relative care
and maternal care during the first year.20 The race-ethnicity results suggest that the
home environments in black and Hispanic families are less conducive to children's
cognitive development. As a result, the opportunities for learning provided by non-
maternal care out of child's home for black and Hispanic children may be better than
those that are provided by their own homes. The race-ethnicity difference in child
care effects is an important topic that warrants future research.

Our findings have some implications, albeit somewhat speculative, for current
welfare reform and child care policies. Tougher work requirements under the current
welfare system result in more children from lower-income families being placed in
some type of non-maternal child care, even during the first year of their life.
Evidence from this study suggests that children might benefit during infancy from
their experiences in certain types of non-maternal child care. Therefore, the increased
use of non-maternal care as a consequence of welfare reform may not adversely
affect the development of children in low-income families.
This study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research.
First, if possible, incorporating measures of the quality of the various child care
types into the empirical model might improve our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the effects of different types of child care. Second, in this study, we use a
mother's eligibility for a child care subsidy as the sole instrument in estimating the
child care choice model. Although this instrument is enough to identify the model, it
may be unduly restrictive. Future studies should investigate other approaches that
use multiple instruments, possibly as many as one for each type of child care being
used. Third, our analysis does not take into account the possibility that the mother's
employment decision might be endogenous. Recent studies have argued that a
mother's employment decision is made simultaneously with her child care choice
decision (Blau and Hagy 1998; Tekin 2002; Bernal and Keane 2006). Conducting a
joint analysis in which it is possible to test for the endogeneity of employment is
therefore an important topic for future research. Finally, in this paper we have
analyzed child development outcomes measured at age three. Further analysis using
child development outcomes at later ages will help in understanding the longer-run
consequences of early child care on children's development.

Notes
1. One exception is Blau and Hagy (1998), who derive the price of child care from a survey of
child care providers.
2. See Reichman et al. (2001) for a complete description of the sample and study design.
3. Sample sizes for each of the outcome variables used in the study are: PPVT (2312); child
internalizing behavior problems (2986); child externalizing behavior problems (2986).
Sample sizes for models using PPVT, which must be completed in person, are smaller than
those for two behavior problems, which can be completed by telephone.
4. In 1999, almost a third of zero- to four-year-old children with non-working mothers were
in non-parental child care (US Census Bureau 1999).
5. Relatives include father (not live-in), sibling, grandparent, mother or father's partner and
other relative on mother's or father's side.
6. Only 26 children at age one were cared for by non-relatives in the child's home
(babysitters, nannies, etc.), so non-relative and family day care home are combined into
one type of paid care.
7. The mother's score on the TVIP is used if her primary language is Spanish. All the PPVT
or TVIP scores are from the 36-Month In-Home Study.

1992; Cleveland and Hyatt 1993; Hagy 1998).
9. See Bickel et al. (2000).
10. About 20% of the observations have at least one missing value for the explanatory
variables; however 85% of these have only one missing value. Four of the explanatory
variables have missing values in more than 5% of the observations. These are father's
weekly hours worked in year 1 (7.9% missing), father's weekly hours worked in year 3
(7.8% missing), whether the father smokes (6.0% missing), and maternal grandfather's
education (7.4% missing).
11. In a sensitivity analysis, several other instruments were examined. First, state child care
regulations were used as instruments, but all the regulation variables were statistically
significant when they were included as control variables in the outcome equation.
Regulations may reflect the quality of child care, which affects children's outcomes
directly. Therefore, state child care regulations may not be the proper instruments. A
second potential candidate for an instrument is an hourly subsidy rate a mother would
receive if she is eligible for child care subsidy. The hourly subsidy rate is calculated as the
difference between state's reimbursement rate and family's co-payment rate. The predictive
power of the hourly subsidy rate in the first-stage child care choice model is fairly weak.
Finally, we considered interactions of subsidy eligibility and region dummies, but found
that subsidy eligibility does not differ significantly across regions. Hence, for our core
models we use subsidy eligibility as a single instrument to identify the effects of child care
types on child development.
12. Non-parametric KruskalÁWallis rank-sum tests were also conducted to identify statisti-
cally significant differences in variable medians across the child care types. The test results
are reported in Table 1.
13. Complete results from the OLS regressions are available from the authors on request.
14. Estimates of the multinomial logit coefficients are not presented here, but are available
upon request from the authors. Maternal care is the base (omitted) category in the
multinomial logit model.
15. Because of the negative sign before the selectivity term in Equation (A.9), a positive
estimate of the selectivity coefficient indicates a negative selection, while a negative
estimate of the selectivity coefficient implies a positive selection.
16. This selection effect is calculated by multiplying minus the selectivity coefficient ((sj
rj
),
times the mean value of the selectivity term (/
¯
l
j
); for children in that type.
17. The selectivity-corrected differential is sometimes referred to as the unconditional
differential, which excludes the selection effects when calculating the expected outcome
in each type of care (Gyourko and Tracy 1988). Some previous studies also calculate the
conditional differential, which includes the selection effects (Gyourko and Tracy 1988;
Brewer, Eide, and Ehrenberg 1999; Zhang 2004). However, the conditional differential is
not the appropriate measure here. If the selection effects were included, the outcome
differential would be the difference between E[yi
(j)j care mode j has been chosen] and
E[yi
(k)j care mode k has been chosen]. This comparison would not control and correct for
the difference in the unobservable characteristics between these two types of child care
(Trost and Lee 1984).
18. The OLS estimation constrains the coefficients of the control variables to be identical
across child care types, which differs from the selection model estimation.
19. For example, it might be possible to combine the FFCWS with another collaborative
study, The Child Care and Parental Employment Study, which conducts child care
provider surveys and direct assessments of child care quality at age three.
20. In a sensitivity analysis, we estimated the general selection model and calculated the PPVT
differentials for a sub-sample of black and Hispanic children. The results indicate
that non-maternal child care types except relative care in the child's home are generally
associated with higher PPVT scores than maternal care for black and Hispanic children.
21. Actual subsidy receipt is potentially endogenous in the child care choice model,
and therefore, cannot be used as an instrument. For example, mothers with strong
preferences for day care centers may be more motivated to apply for or take up a child care
subsidy.

Appendix 1. The generalized selection model
Mothers in our sample face M alternative choices of child care types. They are
assumed to select the one which yields them the highest utility. The outcome of
interest is the development index of child i in care type j (01, . . . , M),
yij
0x?

'uij
(A:1)
where xi
is a vector of observed family and child characteristics, the uij
are normally
distributed error terms, and the bj
are parameters to be estimated.
The ith mother's utility if she chooses child care mode j is given by
Vij
0z?

(A:2)
where zi
is a vector of variables assumed to influence mother's choice of child care
type. The child care mode j is chosen according to the indicator function

Following Lee (1983), we define

After combining Equations (A.2) and (A.4) with Equation (A.3), it follows that

Assuming that the hij
values are independently and identically distributed and have a
type I extreme value distribution (Gumbel distribution), the choice model can be
estimated as a multinomial logit model,

Since the development outcome yij
is observed only when child care mode j is chosen,
the estimated coefficients of a standard outcome equation like Equation (2) will not
be consistent. To estimate the parameters bj
, Lee (1983) proposes a similar two-step
correction procedure as Heckit by transforming eij
into a standard normal random
variable (Gyourko and Tracy 1988),
o+
ij
0F(1[Pr(Ii
0j)] (A:7)
where F is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal
distribution. Then extending Heckman's (1979) argument, Lee (1983) argues that the
expected value of uij
, conditional on mode j being chosen is given by:
E(uij
½ Ii
0j)0(s
j

l((o+

) (A:8)
where l(×) is the `inverse Mill's ratio' and l(o)0
f((o)
F((o)
; f is the standard normal
density, and rj
is the correlation between uij
and o+
ij
; which is assumed to follow a
bivariate normal distribution. A consistent estimator of bj
would then be obtained
by estimating the following equation for each choice j (01, . . . , M):
yij
0x?
ij
b
j
(s
j
r
j
l((o+
ij
)'y
ij
(A:9)
where the error term yij
has a zero mean and is uncorrelated with uij
.
Equation (A.9) can be estimated in two stages. In the first stage, the
polychotomous choice model is estimated by the multinomial logit model. The
estimated coefficients /
^
g
j
are then used to construct the selection-correction term
l((^
o+
ij
) for individuals selecting into each type of care. In the second stage, the
selection-correction term is included in the outcome equation (Equation A.1), which
is estimated by OLS to obtain consistent estimates of bj
and (sj
rj
).
In Lee's model, the selectivity correction term includes only the probability of the
selected child care mode j, based on the assumption that the correlation rj
between
uij
and o+
ij
is independent of (z?
i
g
j
)?s: This assumption restricts the covariances between
the outcome equation residual and the various error terms from the selection model
to be identical across child care modes. In practice, this restrictive assumption
simplifies estimation of Equation (A.9), but may only apply to small samples
(Bourguignon, Fournier, and Gurgand, 2004). Some alternative methods, proposed
by Dubin and MacFadden (1984) and Dahl (2002), relax the strong assumption on
the correlation structures of the residuals in Lee's model, and include the
probabilities of each alternative choice in the selectivity correction term. These
methods, in general, are more flexible and robust if the sample size is large.
Otherwise, it may be more difficult to estimate with accuracy using models with a
large number of parameters. In regard to the small sample size of each non-maternal
child care mode, this study uses Lee's approach to avoid the `curse of dimensionality'
problem.
A major concern in selection models is to identify the selectivity terms by the
inclusion of identification variables. The exclusion restrictions included in the
44 D. Peng and P.K. Robins
selection equation must be (1) related to mothers' choice of child care types, and (2)
uncorrelated with the error term in the child outcome equation. This study
constructs mother's potential eligibility for child care subsidy as an identifying
instrument. Mother's eligibility for child care subsidy is a major determinant of her
receipt of subsidy.21 Economic theory predicts that by making paid care relatively
cheaper, a subsidy will increase the probability of using any type of paid care, and
decrease the likelihood of using unpaid care (Blau and Currie 2004). Since eligibility
for subsidy is largely determined by state subsidy policies, it is unlikely to have direct
effects on children's development. The choice model should be appropriately
identified.
