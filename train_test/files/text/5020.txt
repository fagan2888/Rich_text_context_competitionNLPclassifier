Introduction
According to David Hume, nature has made some people
have higher levels of mental capacities than others. Hume
used the Negro as an example of those who do not have men-
tal capacity. Hume asserts, in his renowned footnote,
I am apt to suspect the Negroes, and in general all the other
species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be
naturally inferior to the whites.1 There never was a civilized
nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any
individual eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious
manufacturers amongst them, no arts, no sciences . . . Not to
mention our colonies, there NEGROE slaves dispersed all over
EUROPE, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of
ingenuity; tho' low people, without education, will start up
amongst us, and distinguish themselves in every profession.
(Hume, 1882, p. 252)
In a similar vein on a geographical standpoint, Immanuel
Kant classified humans into different classes: "white"
(European), "yellow" (Asians), "black" (Africans), and
"red" (American Indians). From a psychological standpoint,
then, within Kant's classification, the American India that
inhabit America, the Africa, the Asia, and the Hindustan
appear to be incapable of moral maturity because they lack
talent--a gift of nature" (Eze, 2001, pp. 97-98; Eze, 2003,
pp. 438-439). In Kant's table of moral classifications, the
"Americans are completely uneducable because they lack
`affect and passion,' the Africans escape such a malheur, but
can only be `trained' or `educated' as slaves and servants"
(Eze, 2003, pp. 438-439). Kant's view was that the African
deserves this kind of "training" because he or she is lazy,
prone to jealousy and hesitation (ibid). Kant argued that "the
African is all these because, for climate and anthropological
reasons, he or she lacks `true'(rational and moral) character"
(Eze, 2003, p. 439; Kant, 1978, p. 264). In 1761, Immanuel
Kant (1997a) wrote,
Montesquieu is correct in his judgement that the weak-
heartedness that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the
Negro also makes him fear many things other than death that the
European can withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns
himself if he is to be forced into slavery. (pp. 62-64)
Kant goes further to attribute to the supposed grades of supe-
riority and inferiority of race to the presence or absence of
"talent." Taking skin color as evidence of a racial class, Kant
said that "white skin, it seems, is only the concrete, physical
evidence of this racial superiority . . . skin colour reveals race
as species class and morally, as `difference in Character'".2
As such, skin color, for Kant, is evidence of rational superi-
ority or inferiority.
In response to Hume and Kant, my aim in this article is to
show that the works of nationalist­ideological philosophers
are evidence that Africans are not irrational or inferior
Whites. I will discuss the works of the nationalist­ideologi-
cal philosophers as evidence of the existence of African phi-
losophy, and hence as a refutation of Hume's and Kant's

Do the Works of the Nationalist­
Ideological Philosophers Undermine
Hume's and Kant's Ideas About Race?
Ovett Nwosimiri1
Abstract
As a response to the question posed in the title, this article presents a critical assessment of how the works of the nationalist­
ideological philosophers can be seen as evidence against David Hume's and Immanuel Kant's ideas of race. Hume and Kant
have certain ideas about race; if these ideas are true, then there is--and indeed, can be--no African philosophy. But there is
African philosophy--that of nationalist­ideological philosophy; therefore, Hume's and Kant's ideas about race are incorrect.

ideas of the Negroes/Blacks, as captured above. My reason
for choosing this trend is that the nationalist­ideological
approach actually helps to untie African from the yolk of
colonialism by showing that intellectual superiority and infe-
riority are something that varies among individuals. Some
persons are more gifted intellectually than others, and this is
not due to one's race or color. Even among people of the
same race, some display higher ingenuity than others.
In the first part of the article, I will briefly explain the idea
of nationalist­ideological philosophy. I will explore the rea-
sons that necessitated the development of nationalistic­ideo-
logical philosophy. In the next part, I will discuss the nature
of nationalist­ideological philosophy, examining the ideas of
Consciencism, Communalism, Humanism, Cultural Life,
Negritude, Black Consciousness, and Pan-Africanism. I will
show that the existence of nationalist­ideological philosophy
is evidence of the existence of African philosophy and hence
serves to refute Hume's and Kant's ideas that Blacks are irra-
tional and inferior to Whites.Against Kant's idea thatAfricans
"can only be `trained' or `educated' as slaves and servants," I
will argue that the philosophical knowledge that someAfrican
philosophers have acquired has falsified his ideas.
Nationalist­Ideological Philosophy
Nationalist­ideological philosophy emanates from the ide-
ologies of national liberation movements. It arose before the
independent era inAfrica.And it also arose out of the convic-
tion that political independence must be accompanied by "a
true mental liberation" (Bodunrin, 1991, p. 64). In essence, it
started off as a fight against colonial imperialistic ideologies
in Africa. This philosophy "advocates mental liberation and
a return to African humanism" (Hapanyengwi-Chemhuru,
2013, p. 46). The conviction that informs this philosophy is
that European model and its ideologies were not appropriate
for Africa. The nationalist­ideological philosophers used a
practical way to convey their ideas through economic, politi-
cal, social, and cultural transformation. Thus, it is not sur-
prising to note that "Nkrumah was deeply convinced that
Africa must rationalize the dominant intellectual strands in
Africa's historical experience and reinstate what was noble
and everlasting in traditional African society" (Mbonjo,
1998, p. 176). Nationalist­ideological philosophy is an
attempt to deal with the problems of national and socialist
revolutions or African revolution (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 183).
What Necessitated Nationalistic­
Ideological Philosophy
Nationalist­ideological philosophy was born out of the strug-
gle for liberation ofAfricans from colonialism. Serequeberhan
(1991, p. 3) explained that colonialism set the communist-
social structure of African societies on the path to ruin, sup-
pressing the stable indigenous African societies, a situation
that left Africans wallowing in a miasma of confusion in
trying to fit in the shoes of their colonizers. Thus, the rich and
solid traditional African life and culture were distorted,
because of colonialism. Africans lost their identity at the
expense of colonial powers. The aftermath of colonialism
propagated "pseudo" ideas such as the conception that tradi-
tional beliefs and social structures (culture and language) are
flawed; hence, there is a need for "civilization." This created
the idea of Africans being inferior to the Europeans.
Nationalist­ideological philosophy was necessitated by the
ravages of colonialism and the need for Africans to liberate
themselves politically, and decolonize their minds from
pseudo-ideas like White supremacy and Black inferiority.
Upon realization of independence, many African leaders
embarked on a quest for solutions to contemporary problems
in Africa. They saw a need to restructure the disfigured and
distorted African society. Consequently, nationalist­ideolog-
ical philosophy can be understood as a reaction to the debased
African sociopolitical system which was created by colonial
powers. It is a response to Western capitalist systems, eco-
nomic imperialism, Marxism, and Western socialism.
Nationalist­ideological philosophy set out on the quest to
reestablish and restructure the African social context after
colonialism. As Makumba (2007) avowed, this trend, "com-
ing from the African worldview, was understood by Africa's
pioneer ideologies to be a worthy response to what had
become a dehumanizing and exploitative situation brought
about by colonization" (p. 135).
Nationalist­ideological philosophy is geared toward defin-
ing a unique African political system which not only decolo-
nizes the African but also equips the nationalist­ideological
philosophers with solutions to contemporary African prob-
lems. This political system is based on traditional African
socialism, humanism, familyhood, and the existential situa-
tion in Africa (Coetzee & Roux, 1998, p. 96). The proponents
of this trend include African leaders and statesmen such as
Léopold Sédar Senghor (from Senegal), Kwame Nkrumah
(from Ghana), Kenneth Kaunda (from Zambia) Julius Nyerere
(from Tanzania), and Jomo Kenyatta (from Kenya), among
others. The trend is embodied in the various manifestos and
political writings produced by these statesmen and leaders
during the African liberation struggle. The philosophical
foundation of this trend, as Makumba puts it, was "influenced
by the political and social urgency of their environment"
(Makumba, 2007, p. 134). These social and political urgen-
cies led these optimistic statesmen to formulate philosophical
blueprints for the reconstruction of their respective countries,
culturally, politically, socially, and economically.
The Nature of Nationalist­Ideological
Philosophy
Nationalist­ideological philosophy, in essence, is an attempt
"to evolve a new and if possible, unique political theory based
on traditionalAfrican socialism and familyhood which Nyerere
calls ujamaa" (Njoroge, 1986, p. 96). Nationalist­ideological
Nwosimiri 3
philosophy can be referred to as a philosophy of transition, "a
voice crying in the wilderness," calling all Africans to con-
sciousness of their own identity and personality (Makumba,
2007, p. 150). It is a social synthesis of contemporary African
reality and African social values. This social synthesis of the
nationalist­ideological philosophy is geared toward political,
economic, social, religious, and cultural situations of pre­ and
post­independent era. Nationalist­ideological philosophy
according to Serequeberhan (1991, p. 20) consists of the "man-
ifestos, the pamphlets and political works produced by the lib-
eration struggle." It encompasses the whole gamut of national
liberation literatures and the African anti-colonial struggles in
which pan-Africanism is inclusive. As a result, the literature
that has been produced in this time constitutes the basis of "an
African philosophical discourse on politics" (Serequeberhan,
1991, p. 20). In other words, "the political and philosophic
output of the African anti-colonial struggle as a whole has to
be understood as the originative grounding that is presup-
posed by contemporary African intellectual works as such"
(Serequeberhan, 1991, p. 20).
The role of nationalist­ideological philosophy is that of
assuming a leading position in the questions of the best options
befitting Africa's divergent conditions of social and political
organization and re-examination and re-appraisal of traditional
culture in the hope of identifying and preserving what is useful
and worth developing from what is obsolete and fit for dustbin.
(Njoroge, 1986, p. 96)
According to the proponents of this movement, there is a
necessary connection between theory and practice, which is
praxis; in a nutshell, it means a unification of theory and
action. Nationalist­ideological philosophers are philoso-
phers of action. These philosophers of the pre­ and post­
independent era saw that theory alone could not solve the
problems of Africa, thus identifying the need to come up
with a pragmatic way of solving African problems. From the
foregoing, it is clear that these philosophers aimed at radi-
cal transformation of political, economic, social, and cul-
tural aberrations in African because of the impact of
colonialism. It aimed at decolonizing the minds of Africans
so that they could--and can--reassert themselves in the
world. According to Mbonjo (1998, p. 183), the hallmark of
nationalist­ideological philosophers is their ardent zeal and
clarion call for all Africans to return to their values and shun
everything Western that is not in conformity with this noble
goal. Njoroge further asserts that the nationalist­ideological
philosophy could also be called "political philosophy"
(Njoroge, 1986, p. 88).
The Philosophical Ideologies of the
Nationalist­Ideological Philosophers
What these African political thinkers have developed and
thus have offered to Africans are ideas such as consciencism,
communalism, familyhood, negritude, humanism, nation-
hood, unification, socialism, and pan-Africanism. Below are
brief explanations of their ideologies.
Consciencism
Consciencism as presented by Nkrumah is the philosophy of
the African revolution which upholds the ideology of social-
ism and the redemption ofAfrican humanist society of the past
(Mbonjo, 1998, p. 177). Nkrumah defined consciencism as
the map in intellectual terms of the disposition of forces which
will enable African society to digest Western and Islamic and the
Euro-Christian elements in Africa, and develop them in such a
way that they fit into the African personality. The African
personality is itself defined as the cluster of humanist principles
which underlie the traditional African society. Philosophical
consciencism is that philosophical standpoint which, taking its
start from the present content of the African conscience,
indicates the way in which progress is forged out of the conflict
in that conscience. (Nkrumah, 1970, p. 79)
Consciencism is both revolutionary and evolutionary.
Consciencism is revolutionary when it deals with colonial-
ism and capitalism. On the contrary, consciencism is evolu-
tionary when it is "considered in relation to the traditional
African society, whose guiding principles of egalitarianism
and the concern of all for each it seeks to reassert and
enthrone and regards as fundamental to any society or social
order" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 177). In other words, there are two
main values found in the traditional African society which
need to be guided or taken care of by the philosophical con-
sciencism. The first is the idea of egalitarianism that all of us
belong to the same species without any discrimination. The
second is that each person is responsible for the other as long
as we live in a community. Consciencism has as starting
point the idea that in every society, there is a kind of explicit
or implicit ideology. And this ideology defines a social cohe-
sion toward a desirable society (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 178).
Hence, consciencism is meant to guide African ideology. In
his own words, Nkrumah affirms that "philosophical con-
sciencism builds itself by becoming a reflection of the objec-
tivity, in conceptual terms, of the unfolding of matter"
(Mbonjo, 1998, p. 179). This leads us to the ethical perspec-
tive of the notion of philosophical consciencism. Hence, it
follows according to philosophical consciencism "that each
man must be treated as an end in himself and not just as a tool
or a means to an end" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 180). In this respect,
Nkrumah writes, "The cardinal ethical principle of philo-
sophical consciencism is to treat each man as an end in him-
self and not merely as a means. This is fundamental to all
socialist or humanist conception of man" (quoted in Mbonjo,
1998, p. 180). Thus for Nkrumah, philosophical conscien-
cism will serve as the solid theoretical foundation on which a
truly unifying ideology for all Africa can be built (Mbonjo,
1998, p. 182).

Thus understood, consciencism could not and cannot
accommodate colonialism. The reason is that colonialism is "a
doctrine of exploitation and a doctrine of alienating" (Mbonjo,
1998, p. 21). This implies that colonialism is a means by which
a colonial power secures material advantages for her own eco-
nomic development. It is considered as a crude form of impe-
rialism, which is the "policy which aims at creating, organizing
and maintaining an empire" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 22).As a result,
African political thinkers, reject colonialism, as well as the
idea that it is to bring civilization to a people or to prepare
them for self-rule.At the Casablanca Conference of January 7,
1961, Nkrumah made a speech which reads,
For my part, I must say that as long as I live, and as long as any
little vestige of colonialism and imperialism remains in Africa, I
shall prosecute a ruthless war on these monsters, a war in which
there shall be no truce. Colonialism and imperialism have no
honour, no shame, no morals and conscience. The devastation
which they have brought in Africa is without parallel anywhere
in the history of the world, but now Africans have arrived on the
scene. We have arrested their progress and are determined to
give them battle with all the forces of our command until we
have achieved the total liberation of the African continent and
have built a strong Union of African states. As I have always
stated, and as I will continue to proclaim, I can see no security
for African states unless African leaders like ourselves have
realized beyond all doubts that salvation for Africa lies in Unity.
(Quoted in Obeng, 1979, p. 2)
Communalism
African traditional worldview encompasses "an attitude towards
the human person, which can only be described, in its social
manifestation, as being socialist" (Makumba, 2007, p. 139).
Hence,African communalism was considered the "socio-politi-
cal ancestor of socialism" (Makumba, 2007, p. 139). Nyerere
calls this Ujamaa, meaning familyhood. This idea of African
socialism is opposed both to capitalism and to Marxist social-
ism.Afamily, according to Nyerere, embraces the whole human
society. So it is "the foundation, and the objective, of African
socialism . . . the trueAfrican socialist system regards all men as
his brethren--as members of his ever-extending family"
(Makumba, 2007, p. 140). In fact, capitalism "seeks happiness
through the exploitation of one person by another, and Marxist
socialism seeks happiness through conflict between persons"
(Makumba, 2007, p. 140). On the contrary, African socialism
rooted in African communalism is "an attitude of the mind"
(Makumba, 2007, p. 140). Its foundation lies in the principle of
human equality which "has to be applied to the different sectors
of society, namely economic, social and political" (Makumba,
2007, p. 141) and based on love and sharing.
Humanism
In the same line as Nyerere's ideas, Kaunda calls the attitude
toward the human person African humanism. This is because
Africa is human-centered and that ideology conquered colo-
nialism (Makumba, 2007, p. 143). Central to Kaunda's
humanist claim is that humanism is rooted in human person
in relation with God.As a result,African humanism is closely
related to Christian anthropology, where the human person is
truly human "only before God and that the spiritual dimen-
sion is an integral part of the human personality" (Makumba,
2007, p. 143). Humanism, as it is with the role of any society,
seeks to uphold and protect the dignity of the human person.
It is a form of socialism that is based on political, social,
cultural, and economic aspects of the life of a human person
and geared toward the improvement of the human life.
Kaunda saw a connection with Christianity, and he advo-
cated religious beliefs as fitting complements to traditional
African society. Humanism was a tool to break away from
the colonial heritage and to develop and reconstruct an
African identity.
Cultural Life
Amilcar Cabral sees cultural life as an element of resistance
to foreign domination (Wolfers, 1979, p. 141). For him, there
is a dependant and reciprocal connection between cultural
factor and the economic and political factor in the behaviors
of human societies.
In fact, at every moment of the life of a society, culture is the
result, with more or less awakened consciousness, of economic
and political activities, the more or less dynamic expression of
the type of relations prevailing within that society. (Wolfers,
1979, p. 141)
Again, there is a characteristic common to every kind of
imperialist domination, which is "the denial of the historical
process of the dominated people by means of violent usurpa-
tion of the freedom of the process of development of the pro-
ductive forces" (Wolfers, 1979, p. 141). In this regard, who
knows what would have been the technological and eco-
nomic development from the different African cultures if
they were not destroyed? The point is that according to
Cabral,
culture is simultaneously the fruit of a people's history and a
determinant of history, by the positive or negative influence it
exerts on the evolution of relations between man and his
environment and among men or human groups within a society,
as well as between different societies. (Wolfers, 1979, p. 141)
Negritude
In the Francophone case, the story has often been told, and
the centrality of the race of negritude cannot be ignored.
Negritude was one of the first anticolonial moments con-
cerned precisely with the idea of race in Africa. "Central to
the concept of negritude is the idea of suffering through ser-
vitude, either directly through slavery or indirectly through
Nwosimiri 5
colonization" (Wolfers, 1979, p. 27). Césaire and Senghor
both experienced the sufferings of racial segregation as
young students. Hence, for them, there was a need for awak-
ening the Black person as a process of converting the victims
into consciousness of reshaping their destiny. Césaire coined
the word "negritude." His idea of negritude originated in his-
tory, and it was one of bitterness and discomfort (Wolfers,
1979). Thus, "Negritude emerged as a concept with different
resonances in, and applicable to, different contexts. Yet, the
re-evaluation of blackness and of the pan-African experience
constituted a denominator common to all its variants"
(Berktay, 2010, pp. 206-207). Césaire defines negritude as
"the sum of the cultural values of the black world as expressed
in the life, the institutions, and the works of black men; the
sum of the values of the civilization of the black world"
(Wolfers, 1979, p. 44). Senghor (2001), in his work
"Negritude and Modernity or Negritude as a Humanism for
the Twentieth Century" explained negritude as a "philosophy
that postulates cultural action adapted to the spiritual and
sociological conditions of the black man" (quoted in Wolfers,
1979, p. 144). He further explains that negritude has a double
meaning: "subjective and objective, particular and universal,
topical and eternal" (Senghor, 2001, p. 144).
Objectively, as a civilization, negritude is the totality of values;
not only those of the peoples of black African, but also of the
black minorities of America, or even of Asia or the South Sea
Islands . . . Subjectively, negritude is a will to take on the values
of the black world, to live them oneself, after having impregnated
and actualized them, but also to make them live in and through
others. (Senghor, 2001, p. 144)
"The supreme value of black African civilization is life
forces" (Wolfers, 1979, p. 45). African values show that
blood bonds are of great significance because of vital reali-
ties, but not just because of race. Senghor holds that "the
family in Africa encompasses all persons descending from a
common ancestor who is responsible for the flame of life
transmitted to his descendants" (Wolfers, 1979, p. 48). As a
result, negritude is all about pointing out the African values
and their authenticity. For instance, Senghor stipulates that
Black man's emotivity is due neither to inherently superior
sensory faculties nor to inherently inferior rational faculties, but
to a particular attitude toward the external world and its apparent
complexity. Essentially positive and dynamic, this attitude is a
direct result of the notion of life force and its intensification and
the tendency to relate to the external world as to a network of
interacting forces. (Wolfers, 1979, p. 75)
It is important to underscore that Senghor may have been
disingenuous, but he is not at all innocent of the ongoing
modern racial battles "over the meaning of reason and
humanity when he notoriously defended a thesis that, on the
surface, is unsurpassably droll: `Emotion is Negro, and rea-
son Greek'" (Eze, 2001 , p. 41). According to Eze, "it is as if
Senghor said, `Well, you keep your Reason; we have our
Emotion. Besides, our Emotion is superior to your Reason'"
(Eze, 2001, p. 41). Senghor's theoretical work illustrates
how race plays itself in modern discourse.
Black Consciousness
Steve Biko says that "the basic tenet of black consciousness
is that the black man must reject all value systems that seek
to make him foreign in the country of his birth and reduce his
basic human dignity" (Biko, 1971). What Biko is trying to
bring to the awareness of the African masses is the injustice
wrought on him by the apartheid era. His main point is that
Africans should seek to reject injustice and recognize her
value, and Africans should stop feeling inferior in their own
home. In other words, he is insisting on a sense of superiority
instead of inferiority among Blacks. According to Biko,
White people "must be made to realise that they are only
human, not superior. Same with Blacks. They must be made
to realise that they are also human, not inferior" (quoted in
Biko, 1978b). What Biko is saying is that the White masses
that colonized and forced apartheid on the Black masses
should not treat Blacks as their inferiors. His idea is that the
White masses are not better than the Blacks; in fact, all peo-
ple are equal and should be treated as such. Biko further said
that by merely "describing yourself as black you have started
on a road towards emancipation, you have committed your-
self to fight against all forces that seek to use your blackness
as a stamp that marks you out as a subservient being" (Biko,
1978a). Thus, it is the responsibility of the Blacks to fight
against oppression.
Pan-Africanism
According to Appiah (1992),
for the generation that theorized the decolonization of Africa,
then, "race" was a central organizing principle. And, since these
Africans largely inherited their conception of "race" from their
New precursors, we shall understand Pan-Africanism's profound
entanglement with that conception best if we look first at how it
is handled in the work of the African-American intellectuals
who forged the links between race and Pan-Africanism. (p. 10)
The idea of African unity that these African political thinkers
were all emphasizing and advocating is mainly expressed in
the movement of pan-Africanism. The latter has as a basic
premise that "the people of Africa and of African descent
throughout the globe, constitute a common cultural and
political community by virtue of their origin in Africa and
their common racial, social and economic oppression"
(Mbonjo, 1998, p. 121). Furthermore, pan-Africanism holds
that in order to bring about effective action for the liberation
and development of Africa, a political, economic, and cul-
tural unity is necessary (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 121). Thus defined,
6 SAGE Open
pan-Africanism started to develop in the nineteenth century,
when the countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone were
formed to "create a homeland in Africa for American Slaves
and return them gradually" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 123). However,
the expression "pan-Africanism" came into use with Henry
Sylvester Williams from Trinidad and William Edward
Burghardt Du Bois of the United States (Mbonjo, 1998, p.
125). The essential elements of pan-Africanism were
"national self-determination, individual freedom and demo-
cratic socialism" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 126). It is in this sense
that one can say thatAfrican unity "can only become a reality
when national self-interest and continent-wide unity come
together" (Makumba, 2007, p. 147).
African Philosophy and Philosophical
Pride: A Response to Hume's and
Kant's Ideas About the Negroes/Blacks
The philosophical writings of the nationalist­ideological
philosophers and some modern African intellectuals arose as
a result of the intellectual racial discrimination and anti-Afri-
can prejudices in the works of some European thinkers like
Hume and Kant. The works of some nationalist­ideological
philosophers have helped tremendously to show thatAfricans
are capable of intellectual exercise. Many works of Africans
or African philosophers have been done just to show their
contrast from that of the West, and to show that they are
intellectually capable of engaging in the discourse.
The philosophical writings of some modern philosophers
like Hume, Kant, and Hegel aroused psychological defen-
siveness by most modern African intellectuals when they
came across intellectual racial discrimination and anti-
African prejudices. Appiah, for example, writes, "Few con-
temporary readers are likely to be undisturbed when they
discover the moments when Africa is banished from Hegel's
supposedly universal history and when Hume declares, in the
essay on `National Characters,' that blacks are incapable of
eminence in action or speculation" (Hume, 1997, p. 400),
and Kant's classification or hierarchical chart on the different
"races." Appiah's statement, the idea of race, and other colo-
nial and neocolonial exploitation and degradation of African
humanity, reawakens the existence of African philosophy. I
use the term "reawakens" because African philosophy
existed, even before colonization. It was as a result of the
Europeans misinterpretation of African cultures, ideas, and
ways of life that Africans reinforced their ideas so that the
Europeans could better understand their philosophy. This
was done after many African scholars assimilated European
culture and lifestyle, through education.
The term "Africa," while generally taken to refer to a par-
ticular geographical area located at the South Pole, has been
bedeviled by different ill conceptions. Terms like "the land of
Darkness," "the dead end," "the cold-less," or "sunny-land"
have been used to describe the continent. As Mogobe B.
Ramose (2003) noted, these derogatory expressions of some
anthropologists point to the fact that the history of Africa is
mainly the history of West European experience of "Africa"
and only incidentally is it the story of the peoples of the con-
tinent about themselves. By implication, all that arises from
Africa is thought to be barbaric and unworthy of being
counted among the credence of human achievement. To this
end, the likes of Hume and Kant would categorizeAfricans as
irrational beings who are unable to engage in critical reflec-
tion upon their own experience. This thought ofAfrican back-
wardness further drove Europeans, albeit their greed for
African's wealth, to invade the continent with the idea of civi-
lization. From this backdrop, the existence of African philos-
ophy is denied. The above also imprints in Kant's and Hume's
minds their wrong views of Blacks. They see Blacks as irra-
tional and inferior to the Whites. But this is a false idea.
Etymologically, philosophy is the love of wisdom. It is an
art of critical reflection upon lived experience. Taken as
such, African philosophy ought to seek to reflect critically
upon the lived experience of the people. So, when we talk
about African philosophy, we are talking about works that
relate to Africa. It can be philosophical works from Africans
that contribute to one's understanding ofAfrica andAfricans,
based on the person's experience of African culture.
According to Oruka, African philosophy in the above sense
"is considered in the terms of African past, current, or poten-
tial contribution to philosophy in the strict meaning of the
term" (Oruka, 2002, p. 120). One thing to note from these
ideas on African philosophy is the contextual specificity of
African philosophy. This is necessary taking into consider-
ation that African philosophy has long been silenced by the
West. In response, Africa must speak up for herself and about
herself. This is crucial also for the need to divest Africa and
her mode of thought of any undue colonial influence. As
Wiredu (1984) aptly noted, this task must be carefully car-
ried out with a double critical stand toward both what is
Western and African. African philosophers must not shy
aware from taking a critical stand toward elements within
their cultural worldview that is inimical to rational thought,
nor should they accept as axiomatic any conceptual work
from the West. On the contrary, both traditions can offer phi-
losophers materials upon which they can conduct their
reflection. Thus, African philosophy can been see as written
and unwritten/oral reflection of thinkers based on the ways in
which African people of the past and the present critically
make sense of their existence, heritage, religion, customs,
their tradition and culture, and the world they live in.
As a reminder, we should note that the contextual specific-
ity spoken of earlier should not be taken to be a report of cul-
tural or communal worldview of a community within Africa.
This is what Oruka (2002) called ethno-philosophy. In the face
of criticisms from outside Africa, African philosophy must
outgrow collective worldview. Because philosophy is primar-
ily about independent thought of persons about phenomena of
their experience, the works of the trend in African philosophy
can be useful to professional philosophers as a material for
Nwosimiri 7
reflection. More importantly, contextual specificity should
take into consideration the diversity ofAfrican cultures; as it is
sometimes said, "there is not one Africa but many." In this
light, Wiredu (1996) made a point by alluding that African
philosophy "have to be intensive studies of those elements of
culture that play significant roles in the constitution of mean-
ings in the variousAfrican world views" (p. 159). This is a call
for particularistic studies that avoid hasty generalization.
To this end, one may object that this culture of specificity
can hamper intra-African and international philosophical
dialogue. This objection need not concern us given that a
particularistic study done in a culture that interprets the lan-
guage of that culture can spur a similar project in another.
This would throw light on concepts with which communica-
tion can be carried out. After all, dialogue presupposes
understanding of differences as well as similarities. "If we
understand `philosophy' as the tradition to which Plato and
Aristotle, Descartes and Hume, Kant and Hegel belong, then
at least the following concepts are bound to be regarded as
central to that canon: beauty, being, causation, evil, God,
gods, good, illusion, justice, knowledge, life, meaning, mind,
person, reality, reason, right, truth, understanding, and
wrong," we will understand that both Western and African
philosophers have engaged themselves in an ongoing task on
these concepts, based on their own view and understanding,
in search of similarities and differences (Appiah, 1992,
pp. 86-87). No doubt, that not all cultures have the above
concepts, but any philosopher talking or discussing about
any of this concept, engage with it in contrast and in connec-
tion to his or her own culture. I think that many works of
Africans or African philosophers with have been done just to
show their contrast from that of the West.
The idea of "African philosophy" as a field of inquiry thus has
its contemporary roots in the effort ofAfrican thinkers to combat
political and economic exploitations, and to examine, question,
and contest identities imposed upon them by the Europeans.
(Eze, 1998, p. 217)
The arrival of the colonizers inAfrica marked the interchange
of modernity and tradition. It is in light of this interchange that I
would like to congratulate nationalist­ideological philosophers
for acting as a backdrop to subsequent philosophical undertak-
ings which were in aid of either redefining or redeeming the
African self-concept and ultimately human nature.
How Is the Nationalist­Ideological
Philosophy and the Existence of African
Philosophy an Indirect Response to
Hume's and Kant's Ideas About the
Negroes/Blacks?
According to Mogobe B. Ramose, "the struggle for reason--
who is and who is not a rational animal--is the foundation of
racism" (Ramose, 2003, p. 3). David Hume and Immanuel
Kant are good examples of the above statement. Hume
believed that "some races have high levels of mental capaci-
ties and that others do not" (Eze, 2001, p. 66). Kant believes
that "white skin, it seems, is only the concrete, physical evi-
dence of this racial superiority skin colour reveals race as
species class (Klassenunterschied) and morally, as `differ-
enceinCharacter'("VerschiedenheitdesNaturcharakters")"3.
In 1785, Kant argued that
the presence of an inflammable "substance" phlogiston in the
African's blood makes the skin colour "black" and, by analogy
and extrapolation is assumed to be responsible for the skin
colour of other "race" or "racial" distinctions. He nevertheless
maintained throughout a hierarchical extrapolation of these
colour differences. (Eze, 2003, p. 441; Kant, 1997b)
From their ideas, it is quite clear that race is a real issue that
affects Africans in various ways. Arguably, the issue of race
can be cited as a prime factor that makes "African Philosophy
labour under this yet-to-end exploitation and denigration of
African humanity. It challenges the long-standing exclusion
as the negative `other' of reason and of the western world in
the major traditions of modern Western philosophy" (Eze,
1998, p. 219).
Nationalist­ideological philosophy and trends of African
philosophy can be conceived as an indirect response to Hume
and Kant. To emphasize this point, I will say that the nation-
alist­ideological philosophy has helped tremendously in the
restoration of African pride. The writings of the philosophers
in this trend are a visible example, and it encompasses the
whole gamut of African values in her political, economic,
and cultural values. They disentangled African society "from
its yolk of colonialism, and then revert to former cardinal
principles of traditional African" (Ochieng-Odhiambo, 2010,
p. 151).
Kant explains that Africans "can only be `trained'or `edu-
cated'as slaves and servants." Against this idea, the national-
ist­ideological philosophers and other African philosophers/
scholars show that they can assimilate European culture and
lifestyle, through education. This is evident today in the way
Africans live, in the nature of their studies, and their com-
munication with others. It was as a result of the Europeans
misinterpretation of African culture, ideas, and way of life
that the nationalist­ideological philosophers reinforced their
ideas so that the Europeans can better understand their phi-
losophy. Following this view, the existence of African phi-
losophy can also be considered as refutation of the ideas of
Hume and Kant. To emphasize this point, Eze says that
African philosophy as a field of inquiry thus has its contemporary
roots in the effort of African thinkers to combat political and
economic exploitations, and to examine, question, and contest
ideates imposed upon them by Europeans. The claims and
counter-claims, justifications and alienations that characterize
such historical conceptual protests and contestations indelibly
mark the discipline of African philosophy. (Eze, 2001, p. 217)
8 SAGE Open
Against Hume's and Kant's ideas that Africans are infe-
rior to the Whites and are irrational beings who are unable to
engage in critical reflection upon their own existence, I will
say that in this case the nationalist­ideological philosophers
used their mental and rational capacities to address and artic-
ulate issues concerning Africa. And this is no different from
what the Europeans or modern Western philosophers have
done. All human being, as rational animals, are endowed
with these capacities, and all societies are confronted by
these ultimate questions. Because we apply reason in all that
we do, reasoning does not belong to anyone; it is part of
nature.
Senghor "advocated some kind of symbiosis within the
African context, for some dominant suppositions within both
the West and Africa context" (Ochieng-Odhiambo, 2010,
p. 151). Senghor stipulates that
Black man's emotivity is due neither to inherently superior
sensory faculties nor to inherently inferior rational faculties, but
to a particular attitude toward the external world and its apparent
complexity. Essentially positive and dynamic, this attitude is a
direct result of the notion of life force and its intensification and
the tendency to relate to the external world as to a network of
interacting forces. (Senghor quoted in Wolfers, 1979, p. 75)
The above explains his idea of the meaning of reason and
humanity. The above reaction from Senghor is an example
that better describes and informs us how the concept of race
has affected some Africans. It explicitly shows Africans'
awareness of racial consciousness and their intellectual urge
to defend it, without the foreknowledge of them being racist
at the same time. And this was what works and writings of
the nationalistic­ideological philosophers actually defended.
Therefore, against Hume's and Kant's misunderstanding of
Africa, I would like to say that the conceptual transforma-
tions that have been happening through the centuries, in both
Africa and Europe, attest to the fact that our articulation of
reality is a highly contested terrain.
Kant further attributed the supposed grades of superiority
and inferiority of race to the presence or absence of "talent."
Skin color for Kant was proof of rational superiority or infe-
riority. His position on the importance of skin color was
obvious in a statement he made on the question of the reason-
ing of a Black person: "This fellow was quite black from
head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid".4 As
such, Skin color has been the primary common sense crite-
rion for racial classification, membership, and identification.
"Skin colour differences are taken for granted as evidence of
racial difference, if not considered to be racial differences in
themselves, then skin colour is assumed to be the evolution-
ary result of ancestral geographical environment" (Zack,
2002, p. 42). According to Zack, there are problems with this
assumption, one being "using an evolutionary geographical
model to explain skin colour differences." Zack further
explains the problems when she states that
People with dark skin are present in cold climates, and light skin
is not necessarily an adaptive advantage in cold climates that
have less sunlight, because recent evidence suggests that vitamin
D can be stored in the body. Even more recent evidence suggests
that skin color differences around the globe are adaptive
responses to the amount of ultraviolent light present. UV light is
necessary to produce vitamin D-3 and folate, which support fetal
growth, and more of it is absorbed by lighter than darker skin.
Too much UV light causes skin cancer, and too little retards fetal
growth and bone development. (Zack, 2002, p. 42)
Zack further asserts that there are two important problems
when we use skin color as the basis for race. The first problem
is an obvious one; it is based on the idea that "apart from cus-
tom, there is no reason to believe that skin colour differences
are in themselves, or in combination with other biological dif-
ferences, sufficiently important to provide a basis for a human
subspecies, or racial, taxonomy" (Zack, 2002, pp. 42-43). The
second problem is that "while skin colour is accepted as a
foundation for racial difference in society, in nature there are
no distinct groups. Furthermore, the geographical continuity
of human skin colour is not an isolated pattern of human phe-
notypical difference" (Zack, 2002, p. 43).
"Race," in Kant's view, is based upon an ahistorical prin-
ciple of reason (Idee) and moral law (Eze, 2003, p. 441). In
1761, Immanuel Kant wrote,
Montesquieu is correct in his judgement that the weak-
heartedness that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the
Negro also makes him fear many things other than death that the
European can withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns
himself if he is to be forced into slavery. The Indian women burn
themselves. The Carib commits suicide at the slightest
provocation. The Peruvian trembles in the face of an enemy, and
when he is led to death, he is ambivalent, as though it means
nothing. His awakened imagination, however, also makes him
dare to do something, but the heat of the moment is soon past
and timidity resumes its old place again. . . . The inhabitant of
the temperate parts of the world, above all the central part, has a
more beautiful body, works harder, is more jocular, more
controlled in his passion, more intelligent than any other race of
people in the world, that is why at all points in time these peoples
have educated the others and controlled them with weapons.
(Kant, 1997a, pp. 62-64)
What the above simply shows is the reaction of different
races when any of them was being forced into slavery. The
Negro slave from Guinea decided to drown himself because
he was being forced into slavery, while the Indian women
decided to burn themselves on the same account of slavery.
Other races also had their own reaction when they were
being forced into slavery. So the idea of all suicide as irratio-
nal is one way to understand the broader view of Kant's argu-
ment as ahistorical. Despite this background, I however think
that the actions of the individual (Kant's examples) show that
they were aware of what they will go through if they were
subjected to slavery. In my view, this can be used against
Nwosimiri 9
Kant's argument on human knowing, because reasoning is a
free gift to humanity. How we as humans and individuals use
it is up to us. Whether we make a wrong judgment or a right
judgment, what counts at the end is the fact that we made use
of it. In the above case, the different examples of people that
Kant mentioned could identify with the "I." That very act of
identification makes them a thinking thing. Their conscious-
ness had reached the objective existence, which in turn made
them to be more aware that it was better to die, than to be
enslaved and tortured to death in the hands of the Europeans.
According to Hill and Bernard (2001, p. 465), "people often
do terrible things from blind sentiments and impulse, not
because they did not think about the outcome of their actions,
but because they are merely taking means perceived as nec-
essary to achieve ends prompted by their non-rational incli-
nations" at that point in time. This is the reason why Hill and
Bernard argued that Kant was obviously aware of but
ignored. This also is a claim I concur with on the basis that as
humans, we must first have a concrete consciousness of who
we are and what we want to do. This is to say, we cannot
know or be conscious of something without participating in
that thing and being participated in by that thing.
Consciousness paves the way for reasoning. When one is
conscious of something, it creates room for thoughts about
that particular think before one's action follows. One's mind/
reasoning/thought has to work in a coherent way with one's
actions. The action of that Negro and that of the other people
that Kant used as an example better explains a reasoning that
coincides with their actions. Thus, in the face of slavery they
thought of what to do to escape slavery and this for me is
coherent reasoning in display.
Against Kant's idea of human classification, Appiah
asserts that the classification of human beings does not
reflect any deep facts about humans in general. In other
words, the concept of race does not reflect any deep facts
about human beings. Human beings as we know have differ-
ent purposes to achieve in life, so the classification of humans
does not tell us which races we should value, as "the num-
bers in the Dewey decimal system does not correspond with
qualities of utility or interest or literary merit" (Appiah,
1992, p. 38).
"The notion of race that was recovered would be of no
biological interest--the interesting biological generaliza-
tions are about genotypes, phenotypes, and their distribution
in geographical population" (Appiah, 1992, p. 37). Besides
the above biological classification or generalizations, the
notion of race would be of no biological interest because all
humans are linked with each other and there is no need to
classify people into different races based on human descent.
According to Appiah, if there arises any need for the classifi-
cation, "we could just as well classify people according to
whether or not they were redheaded, or redheaded and freck-
led, or redheaded, freckled, and broad-nosed too, but nobody
claims that this sort of classification is central to human biol-
ogy" (Appiah, 1992, p. 37). Appiah further argues that "the
appeal of race as a classificatory notion provides us with an
instance of a familiar pattern in the history of science"
(Appiah, 1992, p. 38). Scientists started the idea of classifi-
cation and categorization based on their folk theory of the
world. Gradually science developed and became the sole
tools for a deeper understanding of things around us. Thus,
"in early chemistry, colour and taste played an important role
in the classification of substances; in early natural history,
plant and animal species were identified largely by their
gross visible morphology" (Appiah, 1992, p. 38). Because of
the above and scientists' methods of discovery and organiza-
tion, classification becomes a special activity. "The benefit
we gain is that we are able to make generalization of greater
power and scope" (Appiah, 1992, p. 38), but the disadvan-
tage is that we seem to always classify things that do not
need to be classified.
Concluding on this discourse, Appiah states that
The truth is that there are no races: there is nothing in the world
that can do all we ask race to do for us. As we have seen, even
the biologist's notion has only limited uses, and the notion that
Du Bois required, and that underlies the more hateful racism of
modern era, refers to nothing in the world at all. The evil that is
done is done by the concept and by easy--yet impossible--
assumptions as to its applications.
To call it "biologizing" is not, however, to consign our concept
of race to biology. For what is present there is not our concept
but our word only. Even the biologist who believe in human
races use the term race, as they say, "without any social
implication."5 What exists "out there" in the world--
communities of meaning, shading variously into each other in
the rich structure of the social world--is the province not of
biological but of human sciences. (Appiah, 1992, p. 45)
It is important to underscore that the outlook of Appiah's
argument in defense of the concept of race lies on his idea
that race is an illusion and that the concept of race cannot do
anything for us. More so, the biological idea of race is of
limited use because what biologists seem to suggest about
genetic idea of race based on the idea of classification is dif-
ferent from the historical theory of evolution. Thus, Appiah
believes that race is relatively unimportant because it does
not explain the biological difference among human beings.
An unmistakable feature of the African continent is its
cultural and ideological plurality. We cannot subscribe to any
essentialist notion of African thought, except that, as mem-
bers of human race living on the African continent, we can
all account for an innate capacity to use our mental and ratio-
nal capacities. I believe that there are some questions which
have been accorded greater emphasis in African and those
that need more emphasis, depending on the particular era of
African history. The concept of race is one of these ques-
tions. The arrival of the colonizers in Africa marked the
interchange of modernity and tradition. Out of this conten-
tious union there are some questions, one of which is the
10 SAGE Open
underlying concern of the concept or race and African identi-
ties. It is to this regard that Chinua Achebe said,
It is, of course true that the African identity is still in the making.
There isn't a final identity that is African. But, at the same time,
there is an identity coming into existence. And it has a certain
context and a certain meaning. Because if somebody meets me,
say, in a shop in Cambridge, he says "Are you from Africa?"
Which means that African means something to some people.
Each of these tags a meaning, and a penalty and a responsibility.
(Quoted in Appiah, 1992, p. 173)6
According to Appiah (1992),
meaning is not always one we can be happy with, and identity is
one we must continue to reshape. And in thinking about how we
are to reshape it, we would do well to remember that the African
identity is, for its bearers, only one among many. (p. 177)
Masolo also gives a better explanation of African identity
using the word "return" in Césaire's book. According to
Masolo, the word "return," which appears in the title of
Césaire's poem, Return to My Native Land, is a term
which symbolizes many aspects of the struggle of the peoples of
African origin to control their own identity . . . a symbolic call to
all black peoples to rally together around the idea of common
origin and in a struggle to defend that unifying commonality . . .
--a uniting idea of common origin for all black peoples.
(Masolo, 1994, p. 2)
This commonality became their identity tag and a language
that expresses African's unification. This is exactly what the
nationalistic­ideological philosophers and the existence of
African philosophy have actually shown.
Conclusion
As a refutation of Hume's and Kant's ideas of the Negroes/
Blacks, the main aim of this article has been to show that the
works of nationalist­ideological philosophers are evidence
that Africans are not irrational or inferior to Whites. I started
with a brief explanation on the nationalist­ideological phi-
losophy. As I said earlier, my reason for choosing the nation-
alist­ideological philosophers and their thoughts and
writings is that these works actually helped to untie African
from the yolk of colonialism. The nationalist­ideological
philosophers are the ones that started the movement of
change. This trend is a viable alternative because the philo-
sophical ideology of these philosophers is an ardent call for
all Africans to return to their values. I explored the reasons
behind nationalist­ideological philosophy. I then proceeded
to discuss the nature of nationalist­ideological philosophy.
Following from that, I discussed the philosophical ideologies
of the proponents of the trend, one after the other. In the fol-
lowing section, I argued that the philosophical pride that
some African philosophers and the existence of African phi-
losophy have acquired has falsified Hume's and Kant's ideas
that Blacks are irrational and inferior to the Whites. I con-
cluded the article by explaining why I think the nationalist­
ideological philosophy is a refutation of the ideas of race of
Hume and Kant.

philosophy and ethics. His main concern in this paper is to explain
the works of the nationalist­ideological philosophers and to give a
