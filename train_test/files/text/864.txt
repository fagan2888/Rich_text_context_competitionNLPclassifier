DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 2, FEBRUARY 2000 187
Although GHb is widely accepted as a
useful index of mean blood glucose in
thetreatment of patientswith diabetes,
its use as a screening test for diabetes has
been controversial. Because GHb testing can
be performed at any time of day and with-
out special patient preparation, it is more
convenient for patients and health care
providers than oral glucose tolerance tests
(OGTTs) or even measuring fasting plasma
glucose. However, some reports have sug-
gested that GHb may not be a suitable
screening test because of low sensitivity
(1­8); others have suggested the opposite
(9­21). Although the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) recommends the use of
GHb as a baseline test before initiating ther-
apy (22), ADA does not currently recom-
mend the use of GHb for diabetes screening
or diagnosis (23).
Two recent developments have
prompted the reevaluation of GHb as a
screening test for diabetes. First, the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (NGSP), implemented in 1996,
standardizes GHb results among methods
and laboratories (24). Second, the Report
of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis
and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus,
published in 1997, included new criteria
for diabetes diagnosis that have been
adopted by ADA (25). The new criteria
lowered the fasting plasma glucose cutoff
for diabetes diagnosis from 7.8 mmol/l
(140 mg/dl) to 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl)
and emphasized the use of fasting plasma
glucose rather than the OGTT for diagnos-
ing diabetes. The Expert Committee also
recommended that all individuals aged
45 years and younger individuals at high
risk for developing diabetes be screened at
regular intervals.
Herein, we examine the sensitivity and
specificity of GHb for diabetes screening in
a large and representative U.S. population
by using the new ADA criteria of fasting
plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l as the cutoff
for diabetes diagnosis.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted from 1988
to 1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The survey included a
nationally representative sample of the U.S.
civilian noninstitutionalized population
with oversampling of non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans (26). A total of
23,258 subjects aged 20 years were eligi-
ble for the survey, of which 18,825 com-
pleted a household interview that included
questions to determine whether they had

Use of GHb (HbA
1c
) in Screening for
Undiagnosed Diabetes in the U.S.
Population
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- To evaluate the use of GHb as a screening test for undiagnosed diabetes (fast-
ing plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l) in a representative sample of the U.S. population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey included national samples of non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans aged 20 years. Of these subjects, 7,832 participated in a morning
examination session, of which 1,273 were excluded because of a previous diagnosis of diabetes,
missing data, or fasting time of 8 h before examination. Venous blood was obtained to mea-
sure fasting plasma glucose and GHb in the remaining 6,559 subjects. Receiver operating char-
acteristic curve analysis was used to examine the sensitivity and specificity of GHb for
detecting diabetes at increasing GHb cutoff levels.
RESULTS -- GHb demonstrated high sensitivity (83.4%) and specificity (84.4%) for detect-
ing undiagnosed diabetes at a GHb cutoff of 1 SD above the normal mean. Moderate sensitiv-
ity (63.2%) and very high specificity (97.4%) were evident at a GHb cutoff of 2 SD above the
normal mean. Sensitivity at this level ranged from 58.6% in the non-Hispanic white popula-
tion to 83.6% in the Mexican-American population; specificity ranged from 93.0% in the non-
Hispanic black population to 98.3% in the non-Hispanic white population.
CONCLUSIONS -- GHb is a highly specific and convenient alternative to fasting plasma
glucose for diabetes screening. A GHb value of 2 SD above the normal mean could identify a
high proportion of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes who are at risk for developing dia-
betes complications.

GHb for diabetes screening
previously been diagnosed with diabetes.
Of these subjects, 16,573 participated in a
physical examination that included mea-
surement of GHb and fasting plasma glu-
cose; approximately half (n = 7,832) were
assigned to and participated in a morning
examination session and were asked to fast
for at least 9 h before examination. Subjects
who were assigned to or participated in
afternoon or evening examinations (n =
8,741), subjects in the morning session
who reported a previous diagnosis of dia-
betes (n = 632), subjects who had fasted
8 h before their examination (n = 351),
and subjects who had data missing (n =
290) were excluded from analysis. No sta-
tistically significant differences were evi-
dent between individuals excluded from
the analysis and those included in the
analysis (27). Of the remaining individuals
(n = 6,559), 2,789 were non-Hispanic
white, 1,752 were non-Hispanic black,
1,751 were Mexican American, and 267
were from other racial or ethnic groups. Of
these subjects, 2,871 belonged to a subset
of individuals aged 40­74 years who were
given an OGTT in which plasma glucose
was measured at 2 h after administration of
a 75-g oral glucose load.
GHb was measured as HbA
1c
by using
an ion-exchange high-performance liquid
chromatography method (Bio-Rad Diamat;
Hercules, CA) interassay coefficient of varia-
tion 2%) (28). Fasting and 2-h plasma glu-
cose levels were measured by using a
hexokinase enzymaticmethod(RocheCobas
Mira, Indianapolis, IN) (28). Subjects were
classified as having normal fasting plasma
glucose( 6.1mmol/l),impaired fasting glu-
cose (6.1­6.9 mmol/l), or diabetes ( 7.0
mmol/l) based on the recommendations of
the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and
Classification of Diabetes Mellitus (25). The
weighted mean HbA
1c
for patients with nor-
mal fasting plasma glucose ( 6.1 mmol/l,
n = 5,694) was 5.17 ± 0.45% (mean ± SD).
Weexamined the sensitivityandspecificity of
HbA
1c
to classify subjects as having undiag-
nosed diabetes by using cutoffs of1, 2, 3, and
4 SD above the normal mean.
Statistical analysis was performed by
using SAS (Cary, NC) and SPSS (Chicago)
software packages. The NHANES III sam-
pling design involved unequal probabilities
of selection and planned oversampling of
blacks and Mexican Americans (26). For
this reason, the NHANES III Mobile Exam-
ination Center morning session final weight
was used in analyses so that estimateswould
reflect a representative U.S. population (29).
Logistical regression analysis was used to
model the probability that subjects would
be classified as having diabetes as a function
of their HbA
1c
value. Forthe analysis, ADA's
criteria for diagnosis of diabetes with fasting
plasma glucose were used as the "gold stan-
dard" (i.e., subjects with fasting plasma glu-
cose 7.0 mmol/l were classified as having
diabetes, whereas subjects with fasting
plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l were classified
as not having diabetes). The results were
summarized with receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) analysis to examine the
sensitivity and specificity of HbA
1c
for
detecting diabetes at increasing HbA
1c
cutoff
levels (30). Table 1 summarizes the classifi-
cation of subjects for the ROC analysis. Sen-
sitivity at each possible HbA
1c
cutoff level
was calculated as [TP/(TP FN)] 100,
where TP = true positive (diabetic fasting
plasma glucose and HbA
1c
cutoff level) and
FN = false negative (diabetic fasting plasma
glucose, cutoff level HbA
1c
). The sensitiv-
ity represents the percentage of those with
fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l who
are classified as positive according to HbA
1c
.
Specificity was calculated as [TN/(TN
FP)] 100, whereTN = truenegative(non-
diabetic fasting plasma glucose and cutoff
level HbA
1c
) and FP = false positive (nondi-
abetic fasting plasma glucose, cutoff level
HbA
1c
). The specificity represents the per-
centage of those with fasting plasma glucose
7.0 mmol/l who are classified as negative
according to the HbA
1c
. The ROC curve
plots the sensitivity against 1 minus the
specificity at all possible HbA
1c
cutoff levels.

1c
and fasting plasma glucose were linearly related, and the linear regression line had a correlation coef -
ficient of 0.74. The vertical lines are drawn at fasting plasma glucose levels of 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl)
and 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl). The horizontal line is drawn at an HbA
1c
level of 6.1% (2 SD above the
mean for subjects with a fasting plasma glucose level 6.1 mmol/l).
as estimated by the c statistic, the better the
predictive value of HbA
1c
based on thelogis-
tical regression model. An AUC value of
0.500 would indicate no predictive value,
whereas a value of 1.000 would indicate
perfect predictive value with no false posi-
tives or false negatives.
RESULTS -- Figure 1 is a plot of indi-
viduals according to their HbA
1c
and fasting
plasma glucose values. HbA
1c
and fasting
plasma glucose were linearly related, and
the linear regression line had a correlation
coefficient of 0.74. Figure 2 shows the ROC
plot representing the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of HbA
1c
in detecting undiagnosed
diabetes at each possible HbA
1c
cutoff level.
The analysis revealed a high predictive value
for HbA
1c
in detecting undiagnosed dia-
betes; the AUC was 0.900 (Fig. 2).
Table 2 shows the weighted sensitivity
and specificity of HbA
1c
for detecting undi-
agnosed diabetes at HbA
1c
cutoff levels of 1,
2, 3, and 4 SD above the mean HbA
1c
for
normal subjects (fasting plasma glucose
6.1 mmol/l). As the number of standard
deviations increased, sensitivity decreased,
and specificity increased. HbA
1c
demon-
strated high sensitivity (83.4%) and speci-
ficity (84.4%) for detecting undiagnosed
diabetes at an HbA
1c
cutoff of 1 SD above
the normal mean. Moderate sensitivity
(63.2%) and very high specificity (97.4%)
were evident at an HbA
1c
cutoff of 2 SD
above the normal mean.
Characteristics of subjects who were
above or below an HbA
1c
value of 6.1%
(2 SD above the normal mean) were
investigated further. A total of 265 sub-
jects had a diabetic fasting plasma glu-
cose value ( 7 mmol/l). Of these, 193
had an HbA
1c
level of 6.1%. Of the 72
subjects with an HbA
1c
level of 6.1%,
21 had fasting plasma glucose values
that were very close (7.0­7.2 mmol/l) to
nondiabetic values. Additionally, 24 of
46 subjects in this group for whom 2-h
plasma glucose results were available
showed nondiabetic ( 11.1 mmol/l or
200 mg/dl) 2-h plasma glucose val-
ues.
A total of 6,294 subjects had nondia-
betic fasting plasma glucose values ( 7.0
mmol/l). Most of these (n = 6,024) had an
HbA
1c
level of 6.1%. However, 270 sub-
jects had an HbA
1c
level of 6.1% ( 2 SD
above the normal mean), and 54 had an
HbA
1c
level of 6.5% ( 3 SD above the
normal mean).
Table 3 shows the sensitivity and
specificity of HbA
1c
at a cutoff value of
6.1% (2 SD above the normal mean) by
racial and ethnic group. The estimated sen-
sitivity was higher in the non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American populations
than in the non-Hispanic white population.
The estimated specificity was slightly
higher in the non-Hispanic white and Mex-
ican-American populations than in the
non-Hispanic black population.
The sensitivity of HbA
1c
6.1% for
detecting impaired fasting glucose was low
(13.4%), although the estimated mean
HbA
1c
was higher for those with impaired
fasting glucose compared with those with
normal fasting glucose (5.59 vs. 5.17%).
CONCLUSIONS -- We previously
studied the use of GHb as a screening test
in a Pima Indian population with a high
prevalence of type 2 diabetes and found
high sensitivity and specificity for detecting
diabetes compared with the OGTT (21). In
the present study, we demonstrate that
GHb is both sensitive and specific for
detecting undiagnosed diabetes as defined
by a fasting plasma glucose level 7.0
mmol/l (126 mg/dl) in a large and repre-
sentative U.S. population sample.
We found indications of some differ-
ences in the sensitivity and specificity of
GHb among ethnic groups. A higher preva-
lence of diabetes among the non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American populations
compared with the non-Hispanic white
population has been well described (27),
but further studies are needed both to con-
firm and explain why GHb has better sen-
sitivity as a screening test in these high-risk
populations.
The ADA Expert Committee recom-
mended that screening for diabetes be
accomplished primarily by measuring fast-
ing plasma glucose. However, fasting is
inconvenient for patients, and subjects do
not always fast properly, which can lead to
misdiagnosing diabetes (31). In contrast,
GHb can be measured at any time of the
day regardless of the length of fast or the
content of the previous meal. Moreover,

GHb can be analyzed with a small amount
of sample, as little as 5 µl of blood obtained
from a fingerstick (32). Blood can even be
collected on filter paper and sent to a central
laboratory for analysis (33) when screening
individuals who live in remote areas.
GHb is a more comprehensive mea-
sure of total glycemic exposure than fasting
plasma glucose in that it is a measure of
plasma glucose not only in the fasting state
but also in the postprandial state. Hence, it
may be a better predictor of glycemia-
related complications. GHb is highly cor-
related with the presence of diabetic
microvascular complications in prospec-
tive studies (20,25,34­37), and McCance
et al. (20) further demonstrated that GHb
is as effective a predictor of microvascular
complications as fasting plasma glucose.
The Expert Committee did not select GHb
as the screening or diagnostic method
because of "the many different methods for
the measurement of GHb" and because
"nationwide standardization of the GHb
test had just begun" (25). However, the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardiza-
tion Program has obviated these issues by
making standardization of GHb methods
widely available (24). The NGSP certifies
manufacturers' GHb testing methods as
traceable to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) reference.
Therefore, results from NGSP-certified
methods are comparable between methods
and laboratories, as demonstrated by
recent College of American Pathologists
survey data (38), and can be directly
related to DCCT-determined risks for the
development of microvascular complica-
tions. The ADA has recommended that
only NGSP-certified methods be used to
measure GHb (39), and most of the major
GHb assay methods currently in use are
certified by the NGSP (40).
In summary, GHb is a highly specific
and convenient method to use in screening
for undiagnosed diabetes. A GHb value of
2 SD above the normal mean could identify
a large proportion of individuals with undi-
agnosed diabetes who are at risk for devel-
oping diabetes complications.
