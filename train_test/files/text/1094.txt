Objective: To understand associations of punitive policies to the population preva-
lence of injection drug users and to HIV seroprevalence among injectors.
Design and methods: A lagged-cross-sectional analysis of metropolitan statistical area
data. Estimates of drug injectors per capita and of HIV seroprevalence among injectors
in 89 large US metropolitan areas were regressed on three measures of legal repres-
siveness (hard drug arrests per capita; police employees per capita; and corrections
expenditures per capita) controlling for other metropolitan area characteristics.
Results: No legal repressiveness measures were associated with injectors per capita; all
three measures of legal repressiveness were positively associated with HIV prevalence
among injectors.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that legal repressiveness may have little deterrent
effect on drug injection and may have a high cost in terms of HIV and perhaps other
diseases among injectors and their partners ­ and that alternative methods of main-
taining social order should be investigated. ß 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

Introduction
Becker [1], Wilson [2], and many other analysts argue that
punishment and stigmatization deter criminal behavior
by making it costly for the perpetrator. Politicians and
the mass media have highlighted crimes and drugs as
the cause of many social problems, and have thereby
stigmatized criminals and, in particular, drug users [3,4].
Perhaps as a consequence of these arguments and stigma-
inducing activities, there has been a great increase in
the USA in state and local law enforcement personnel
(from 770 000 in 1992 to 951 000 in 2002), expenditures
for incarceration (from US$ 100 per capita in 1991 to
US$ 184 per capita in 2001), and arrests and imprison-
ments in the USA in recent decades (jail and prison
inmates increased from 1.2 million in 1990 to 2.1 million
in 2001) [5]. Much of this repressive effort has focused on
the `War on Drugs'; arrests for drug possession in the
United States increased from 540 800 in 1982 to
1 235 700 in 2002 [6].
Punishment and stigmatization may have unanticipated
effects on public health in general and on drug-related
harm in particular. As injection is a more efficient means
of taking drugs than intranasal use, a number of resear-
chers have suggested that punishment and stigmatization
might increase the pressures on non-injecting heroin
users and perhaps cocaine users to take up injection drug

use (and for injectors to continue injecting) through
decreasing the supply of drugs or driving up their costs
[7,8]. Others have found that aggressive police tactics
and/or stigmatization may lead injection drug users
(IDUs) to engage in hurried injection behaviors, to share
syringes more often, and/or to inject in high-risk
environments [9­16] and, in addition, to impede the
creation or functioning of syringe exchange [17­20],
drug treatment or other programs to improve users'
health [21].
This study investigated whether three measures of legal
repressiveness in large US metropolitan areas were
associated with the population prevalence of injection
drug use and with HIV prevalence among IDUs.
Methods
`Sample' and its statistical implications
The sample was the 96 largest metropolitan statistical areas
(MSA) in the USA in 1993. MSAs, as defined by the US
Census Bureau, are contiguous counties that contain a
central city of 50 000 people or more and that form a
socio-economic unity as defined by commuting patterns
and social and economic integration within the
constituent counties [22,23]. The paper thus studies a
`population' rather than a sample, so there is no sampling
error (although there is measurement error). The relevance
of statistical inference is debatable. Some researchers
studying similar populations use `P-values' or `confidence
intervals' as heuristic devices to avoid over-interpreting
model parameters [24­29] (We refer here to `pseudo-
confidence intervals'.) Other analysts might view the
population as a random sample of `possible universes'; in
this interpretation `pseudo-confidence intervals' has a
probabilistic interpretation.
Missing values on the three measures of legal repressive-
ness reduced the number of MSA (N) to 89.
Variables
Dependent variables
As the derivations of both dependent variables (injectors per
capita and HIV prevalence among injectors) have been
described previously, they are described only briefly here.
Drug injectors per capita in the MSA population in 1998. This
was estimated in a three-step process [30]. The number of
persons who had injected drugs in the USA in 1998 was
first estimated by adjusting and averaging others' prior
estimates [31,32]. This number was then allocated to each
MSA using four multipliers (using data on drug injectors
among drug abuse treatment populations, HIV counsel-
ing and testing clients, and AIDS cases, and estimates of
numbers of injectors and HIV prevalence among them in
1993) [30]. These four estimated numbers of injectors in
each MSA were then averaged; and the mean divided by
the MSA population.
HIV prevalence. This was defined as the proportion of
IDUs who were HIV positive among IDUs in 95 MSAs
in 1998, and was estimated by taking the mean of
two estimates [33]. The first estimate was calculated by
modifying Centers for Disease Control (CDC) voluntary
HIV counseling and testing data to correct for their
inherent underestimation of prevalence. Research-based
data on HIV prevalence for 25 MSAs were used to
calculate regression equations to perform these adjust-
ments. The second estimate was based on methods
developed by Lieb et al. [34]. Briefly, the estimated total
number of HIV-positive IDUs (including those who
are also men who have had sex with men) living in
an MSA was designated as k (and estimated by adjusting
data on AIDS cases). The estimated numbers of IDUs (a)
[30] and the estimated HIV prevalence among IDUs (b)
were variables related by the function, k ¼ ab; thus,
b ¼ a/k.
Almost all of the independent variables precede the
dependent variables in time so that the temporal sequence
is correct. (This does not, of course, take account of
the high degree of autocorrelation over time in many of
these variables.)
Independent variables
The main independent variables were the three measures of
legal repressiveness. They are: (1) arrests for possession or
sale of heroin or cocaine (1994­1997), taken from US
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data; (2) police
employees per capita (1994­1997), taken from FBI data
[35,36]; and (3) `corrections' expenditures per capita
(1997), taken from United States Census Bureau data on
government finances [37].
Arrests for possession or sale of heroin or cocaine (1994­1997).
Arrest of drug users may be an indicator of pressures on
police; and the fear of arrest may encourage drug users to
become or remain drug injectors and also may lead
injectors to inject less safely [9,10,14­16].
Police employees per capita. This may reflect a public
willingness to spend money and person-power on
policing. It may also indicate more direct effects on
HIV risk; for example, Davis et al. [20] found that police
presence, as distinct from arrests, was associated with less
use of syringe exchanges in Philadelphia.
Correction expenditures per capita. These are an indicator of
public willingness to spend resources on local incarcera-
tion and probation systems as well as an indicator of the
number of people arrested and the average time they
spend in jail before and after trial, which would tend to
increase fear of arrest and thus to risk of using drugs by
injection in unsafe ways (as discussed above).

Consideration was given to using factor analysis as a data
reduction strategy, but the three variables had inter-
correlations that were too low for the resulting single
factor to be meaningful (it captured slightly less than 50%
of the variance; correlations were 0.08 between police
employees per capita and corrections expenditures per
capita; 0.19 between police employees per capita and
heroin and cocaine arrests per capita; and 0.36 between
heroin and cocaine arrests and corrections expenditures
per capita.).
Control variables
Based on a review of relevant literature, a number of
variables were included in the analyses as control variables
because they might affect the dependent variables at the
metropolitan area of analysis. These included the follow-
ing items.
Region. US regions differ politically and culturally, and
on mean values of both dependent variables and the
three legal repressiveness measures. In order to make our
categories for regions more homogeneous politically,
culturally and economically, US Census categories for
Region were adjusted by moving Maryland, Delaware
and Washington, DC, to the Northeast Region; Texas
to the West; and Oklahoma to the Midwest. Midwest
was treated as the reference category because it had
the lowest mean value on drug injectors per capita. (It
had the second lowest mean value, 4.85%, on HIV
prevalence, which was statistically indistinguishable
[P(t) ¼ 0.59] from the mean 4.56 HIV prevalence in
the West.)
Presence of laws against over-the-counter sales of syringes. These
laws were associated with higher levels of injectors per
capita, and with greater HIV prevalence and incidence
among IDUs, in 1993 [38].
Unemployment rate in 1990 [39]. A number of studies have
found that economic conditions are associated with rates
of substance use and/or HIV prevalence [38,40,41].
Proportion of the MSA population who are black. Many studies
have found that black injectors are more likely than
other injectors to be HIV infected and/or to have AIDS
[42­48]; and earlier research from this project shows that
higher percentages of black populations than of whites
in these metropolitan areas are injection drug users
[49].
For analyzing HIV prevalence, injection drug users per
10 000 population in 1993 [32] was also used as a control
variable. It was a predictor of HIV prevalence among
injectors in 1993 [38].
Statistical analysis
Since the unit of analysis in this study is the metropolitan
area, dependent variables are rates for a given metropo-
litan area. Correlation and linear regression are used to
estimate associations among variables. Standardized
coefficients (betas) are reported to facilitate comparisons
of magnitudes of association. Regression diagnostics in-
cluding collinearity diagnostics, tests of the assumptions
of the model and tests for outliers and influential points
were assessed. Sensitivity analyses assessed the effects of
metropolitan areas with particularly high or low values of
the dependent variables as well as possible measurement
error in the dependent variables. Statistical analyses were
done in SAS version 9 [50].
Results
Injectors per capita range from one-fifth of 1% to almost
2% of the population in these metropolitan areas
(Table 1). HIV prevalence among injectors also has
considerable range, from 2.4 to 27.4%.
In bivariate relationships, both per capita heroin and
cocaine arrests and corrections expenditures per capita are
associated with the number of injectors per capita
(Table 2). After controlling for region and other variables,
however, none of the three measures of legal repressive-
ness has a pseudo-P below 0.2.
All three measures of legal repressiveness are associated
with higher HIV prevalence in bivariate analysis and with
other potential predictors statistically controlled. Police
employees per capita has the strongest association
(beta ¼ 0.358) with HIV prevalence, such that a one
standard deviation increase in police employees per capita

predicted value of HIV prevalence (Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
The data used for the dependent variables were subject to
considerable potential error whose magnitude and
variance are not well-characterized. To assess the
sensitivity of results to such error, we re-ran the
regressions based on two different logics. First, we re-
ran them for each dependent variable after removing the
two metropolitan areas with the highest and the two with
the lowest values on that dependent variable. (Hence,
N ¼ 85 for each of these analyses.)
Second, each dependent variable had been created as the
mean of separate partial estimates ­ four separate esti-
mates of drug injectors per capita [30] and two separate
estimates for HIV prevalence [33]. We thus re-ran the
analyses separately using each of the separate partial
estimates in turn as the dependent variable.
Between analyses removing the extreme values and those
using the separate partial estimates, the sensitivity analyses
produced three separate regression equations for HIV
prevalence, each of which estimated the regression
coefficients for each of the three indicators of repres-
siveness, and five equations for injectors per capita. The
nine estimated parameters for HIV prevalence were all
positive in the three sensitivity regressions for that
dependent variable, with seven of them significantly so.
None of the 15 parameters in the five sensitivity
regressions for injectors per capita was significantly diffe-
rent from zero.
We then compared the parameter estimates for the new
equations with those in the original run, using t-tests and

treating the original value as fixed. Of the 24 compari-
sons, one was significant at P < 0.05, and another at
P < 0.10, which is approximately what would be
expected from a set of random numbers. Thus, the
models do not appear to be very sensitive to likely errors
in the dependent variables.
Discussion
Legal repressiveness is not independently associated with
higher rates of injectors in metropolitan populations but is
associated with higher HIV prevalence among injectors.
These findings are subject to a number of limitations.
First, causal mechanisms are hard to study at a single level
of analysis as both higher-level and lower-level variables
may affect observed relationships. Similarly, although
almost all independent variables precede the dependent
variables in time, all variables are subject to considerable
temporal autocorrelation. Thus, causal inference would
have been stronger if longitudinal data had been used.
Such analyses are planned for the relatively near future,
including further study of the possibly two-directional
relationships between legal repressiveness and injectors
per capita. `Police employees per capita' is not the same as
police on duty in drug-using areas or in drug squads,
which may or may not have attenuated the effects of this
variable. As police squads that exclusively target drug
activities have been found to have particularly deleterious
effects on HIV risk behaviors [10], future research should
study the effects of particular categories of police
personnel on drug injection and on HIV.
These data offer no support for deterrence theories that
hold that legal repressiveness reduces levels of injection
drug use since the multiple regression coefficients had
pseudo-P values above 0.2. In this, they parallel the
findings of Reinarman et al. [51] that legal repressiveness
is not associated with patterns of cannabis or other drug
use (among cannabis users) in a comparison of two cities
with different drug policies.
The main finding of this paper is that higher rates of three
measures of legal repressiveness are associated with higher
HIV prevalence among injectors. This may be because
fear of arrest and/or punishment leads drug injectors to
avoid using syringe exchanges [13,19,20,52], or to inject
hurriedly [9,10,16] or to inject in shooting galleries or
other multiperson injection settings [53] to escape
detection. Numerous studies have found that hurried
injection and injection in shooting galleries and similar
locations, as well as injecting while incarcerated [54,55],
are associated with riskier injection practices
[14,15,52,53]. The comparatively large magnitude of
the association between police employees per capita and
HIV prevalence suggests that the total size of police
departments may be an important factor in heightening
these risks. In addition, the stigmatization side of legal
repressiveness may create, among drug users, lowered self-
concepts and other psychological or social conditions
conducive of greater risk [56]; and may lead to public
opinion that makes it more difficult to set up, fund, or find
locations for syringe exchanges and drug treatment
facilities [21,57,58].
It is critical to note that although large numbers of police
employees and high expenditures on corrections may
generally be associated with high rates of HIV among
injectors, they do not always preclude implementation of
effective HIV prevention programs. Although New York
City is high on the measures of legal repressiveness, New
York State legalized and funded large-scale syringe
exchange programs carried out by non-profit organiz-
ations beginning in 1992. This was followed by an 80%
reduction in HIV incidence among IDUs in the city [59].
From our experience, we would suggest that the
development of co-operative working relationships
between public health authorities and law enforcement
authorities to promote HIV prevention programs for
IDUs was crucial. Although policy and legal changes
facilitated this co-operation, the existence of co-
operation at the street level was key to this success.
The implications of this paper are clear. In terms of
research, more study is needed to determine the sequelae
of legal repressiveness (including determining whether
the associations found in this paper are causal) and the
mechanisms through which these sequelae arise. In terms
of policy and practice, these findings suggest that legal
repressiveness may have little deterrent effect on drug
injection and may have a high cost in terms of HIV and
perhaps other diseases among injectors, their partners,
and the broader community, and that alternative methods
of maintaining social order should be investigated.
