Abstract
Only a handful of public health studies have investigated expectations of early death among adolescents. Associations have
been found between these expectations and risk behaviors in adolescence. However, these beliefs may not only predict
worse adolescent outcomes, but worse trajectories in health with ties to negative outcomes that endure into young
adulthood. The objectives of this study were to investigate perceived chances of living to age 35 (Perceived Survival
Expectations, PSE) as a predictor of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and substance use in young adulthood. We examined
the predictive capacity of PSE on future suicidal ideation/attempt after accounting for sociodemographics, depressive
symptoms, and history of suicide among family and friends to more fully assess its unique contribution to suicide risk. We
investigated the influence of PSE on legal and illegal substance use and varying levels of substance use. We utilized the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) initiated in 1994­95 among 20,745 adolescents in grades 7­
12 with follow-up interviews in 1996 (Wave II), 2001­02 (Wave III) and 2008 (Wave IV; ages 24­32). Compared to those who
were almost certain of living to age 35, perceiving a 50­50 or less chance of living to age 35 at Waves I or III predicted
suicide attempt and ideation as well as regular substance use (i.e., exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking; smoking $
a pack/day; and using illicit substances other than marijuana at least weekly) at Wave IV. Associations between PSE and
detrimental adult outcomes were particularly strong for those reporting persistently low PSE at both Waves I and III. Low
PSE at Wave I or Wave III was also related to a doubling and tripling, respectively, of death rates in young adulthood. Long-
term and wide-ranging ties between PSE and detrimental outcomes suggest these expectations may contribute to
identifying at-risk youth.

Introduction
Perceptions of immortality and invincibility have been offered as
explanations for heightened risk-taking among youth [1]. Howev-
er, fatalism and perceived vulnerability may also encourage
greater recklessness. Cross-sectional studies linked adolescent
expectations of early death to risk behaviors like suicide
ideation/act, impulsive sensation-seeking, drinking and driving,
and selling drugs [2,3]. Studies utilizing data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) identified
low perceived chances of living to age 35 (which we term
Perceived Survival Expectations, PSE) as a predictor of future
suicide attempt, fight-related injury, unsafe sexual activity, police
arrest, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis [4]­and
most recently to cigarette smoking [5]. The importance of low PSE
is underscored by their prevalence among youth. One in seven
adolescents at Wave I of Add Health reported perceiving a 50­50
chance or less of living to age 35 [4].
Low PSE may reflect an overall tendency to view the future
pessimistically, fatalistically and with resignation. Hopelessness has
been linked with violence involvement, substance use and early
sexual activity among adolescents [6]. As described above,
analogous associations have been found for low PSE [4].
Hopelessness may impair an individual's abilities to define
problems and to formulate and implement their solutions [7].
Recently, low PSE were linked to avoidance of problems and
acting without considering consequences [8]. Essential compo-
nents of hopelessness include the expectation that desired events
will not occur, negative events will occur, and nothing can be done
to change the course of these events. Beck's original 20-item true/
false hopelessness scale was composed of items such as ``My future
seems dark to me,'' and ``I might as well give up because I can't
make things better for myself'' [9]. There are current movements
to incorporate considerations of survival expectations more
directly into hopelessness theory. For instance, Bolland added
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e41905
the following item to his hopelessness scale: ``I don't expect to live
a very long life'' [6].
Suicide and Substance Use among Young Adults
Among those 25­34 years old, suicide represents the second
leading cause of death (12.3 suicide deaths per 100,000) [10]. One-
third of suicide attempts result in injuries that require medical
attention [11]. Suicidal behavior among youths is strongly related
to psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder,
antisocial behaviors, and substance use disorder [12]. Hopelessness
is also tied to suicidal behavior [13,14]. Other key risk factors for
suicide include family history of suicide and psychopathology,
stressful life events such as child abuse, violence exposure, and
social/economic disadvantage [12,15]. Structural factors related to
suicide include neighborhood poverty/economic deprivation [16].
Protective factors include family cohesion (i.e., mutual involve-
ment, shared interests, emotional support) and religiosity [17].
Suicide deaths are more prevalent among men but women
attempt suicide more often [18].
Additionally, substance use has substantial health costs.
Cigarette smoking is the largest individual cause of preventable
deaths and morbidity across the world [19]. Alcohol accounts for
approximately 3% of global deaths and 4% of disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) [20]. Illicit substance use is connected with
excess mortality, fatal and non-fatal injuries, motor-vehicle
accidents, violence and psychiatric disorders [7]. Substance use
peaks in young adulthood, reaching 72% by age 27. Daily
drinking, binge drinking and daily drunkenness are at their
maxima in young adulthood [21].
Identified risk factors for substance use are extensive and
include regulations and norms favorable to drug use, availability of
drugs, severe economic deprivation, psychiatric disorders, family
history of substance use, family conflict, low family attachment,
low school commitment, early peer rejection, social pressure,
alienation and rebelliousness [22]. Men have higher rates of
substance use and problem use than women [23,24]. Personality
traits hypothesized to be associated with substance use include
hopelessness, impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, and sensation-seeking
[7].
PSE as a Predictor of Young Adult Risk Behaviors
Previously, low PSE has been connected to a variety of adverse
health outcomes including fight-related injury, diagnosis of HIV/
AIDS, and police arrests [4]. In this study, we investigate
expectations of an early death as a predictor of young adult
suicidal behavior and substance use­two categories of risk
behaviors that exert large health burdens on this age group. We
hypothesize that PSE increases the likelihood of both types of
behaviors. People who perceive a severely bleak or limited future
may respond to challenges with fatalism and less persistence. They
may set fewer goals, seek less guidance, and develop or attempt
fewer solutions to their problems [25]. Low PSE in adolescence
may increase the risk for suicide later in life through the
development of cognitive schemas in which negative events are
seen as inevitable and desired events are seen as unattainable.
Individuals with low PSE may be more apt to believe that their
problems are insoluble and to view suicide as the only recourse. It
is also important to assess whether such associations persist even
after accounting for depressive symptoms, religiosity, and history
of suicide among family and friends along with other potentially
confounding factors. Additionally, perceptions of a bleak future
may encourage substance use by promoting a disregard of future
consequences or encourage substance use as a means to cope.
People who perceive poor life chances may act more recklessly
[2,3,4,8].
Recently, McDade et al. using Add Health data connected
lower PSE to higher daily number of cigarettes among current
smokers [5]. Another Add Health study found that adolescents
who reported low PSE at Waves I and II were more likely to
report past-year illicit substance use compared to those who had
high PSE at both waves, although effect measures bordered
statistical significance [8]. A third study found Wave I PSE was
unrelated to past-year illicit substance use at Waves II and III [4].
Nonetheless, marijuana, the most common illicit substance, was
not distinguished from other illicit drugs. Approximately three-
quarters of illicit drug users report marijuana use [26]. The health
effects of marijuana are also generally more benign than those of
other illicit drugs [27]. In addition, these studies did not examine
varying levels of use and they did not investigate alcohol use.
Previous studies have only examined past-year illicit substance use.
Study Aims and Hypotheses
The aim of this study was to examine associations between PSE
and future suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance use in
young adulthood after accounting for important confounding
factors that relate to low PSE and to the detrimental outcomes
under investigation. This study utilized data from Add Health to
test two hypotheses:
1. Low PSE at Waves I and III will be associated with increased
suicidal ideation and suicide attempt at Wave IV.
2. Low PSE at Waves I and III will be associated with increased
cigarette smoking, alcohol use, marijuana use and other illicit
substance use at Wave IV.
The efficiency of PSE cannot be over emphasized. PSE was
assessed with one survey question pertaining to respondents'
perceived chances of living to age 35, and Wave I occurred 13­14
years prior to Wave IV. If PSE is predictive of detrimental
outcomes at Wave IV even after adjusting for important individual
and contextual confounding factors, it merits consideration as
a tool to identify at-risk youth.
Methods
Study Population
This study utilized data from Add Health, a nationally
representative field study of 20,745 U.S. adolescents in grades 7
through 12 during the 1994­1995 school year. The Wave I
response rate was 79% (mean age 16) [28]. Three in-home follow-
up interviews of the cohort have been completed: Wave II in 1996
(88% of the eligible cohort at Wave I; mean age 16), Wave III in
2001­2002 (77%; mean age 22), and Wave IV in 2008 (80%;
mean age 28). By design, high school seniors at Wave I were not
re-interviewed at Wave II, but were included in Waves III and IV.
At Wave IV, 15,701 respondents aged 24 to 32 years were
interviewed. The analytic sample was restricted to respondents
with non-missing survey weights (N = 14,800 with Wave IV cross-
sectional weights and N = 12,288 with valid longitudinal weights
for analyses that use data from Waves I, III, IV).
Variable Coding/definitions
Variable definitions can be found in the Supplemental Materials
(Table S1). The main predictor of interest is Perceived Survival
Expectations (PSE). Respondents were asked at Waves I, II and III,
``What are your chances of living to age 35?'' Possible responses
were: ``almost no chance;'' ``some chance, but probably not;'' ``a
Early Death Expectations and Adult Outcomes
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e41905
50­50 chance;'' ``a good chance'' and ``almost certain.'' Consistent
with previous literature, we collapsed PSE equals ``50­50 chance''
with lower categories [4]. We also assessed whether more
moderate departures from certainty of living to age 35 (i.e.,
reporting ``a good chance'') were also related to adverse outcomes.
Wave IV outcomes. Outcomes under examination included
suicidal ideation and attempt as well as substance use at Wave IV.
Both suicidal ideation (assessed via the question, ``During the past 12
months, have you ever seriously thought about committing
suicide?'') and suicide attempt (assessed via the question, ``During
the past 12 months, how many times have you actually attempted
suicide?'') were coded dichotomously due to low prevalences of
both behaviors. All respondents were asked about the number of
suicide attempts regardless of their response to the question on
suicidal ideation. To investigate whether PSE is differentially
related to divergent levels of substance use, we coded substance use
with a series of polytomous variables­with the exception of
exceeding recommended daily limits for moderate drinking which was
defined as two or more drinks per day for women and three or
more drinks per day for men [29]. Cigarette smoking had the
following levels: A) none, B) less than daily smoking, C) daily
smoking but less than a pack a day, and D) at least a pack a day
[30]. Binge drinking was defined as 5/4 [men/women] or more
drinks in a row [31]. We also investigated marijuana use and use of
illicit substances other than marijuana. Frequency of the latter three
outcomes was examined with the following levels: none, monthly
or less, 2­3 days/month, at least weekly. This study contributes to
the literature by exploring PSE as a predictor of a variety of
substance use behaviors (i.e., cigarette smoking, binge drinking,
heavy daily drinking, marijuana use, and other illicit substance
use)­and at varying levels of use from occasional to regular use.
Covariates. The primary aim of this study is to study is to
assess PSE as a predictor of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and
substance use in young adulthood, independent of important
confounding factors. The following covariates were selected
a priori based upon the literature demonstrating their relationship
to lower PSE and greater engagement in risk behaviors [4,5,8,32]:
age (years), sex, foreign-birth, race/ethnicity, parental education,
family structure, childhood physical maltreatment, childhood
sexual abuse, 12-month family history of suicide, 12-month
history of suicide among friends, substance use, self-rated health,
religiosity, depressive symptoms and parental attachment/support
(Table S1). Indices were constructed for depressive symptoms,
religiosity and parental attachment/support. For each index,
scores were calculated by averaging across items composing the
index. We required valid responses for two-thirds of questions
composing the indices. Internal consistency of items composing
the indices was satisfactory with Cronbach's alphas approximately
0.70 or greater. For all variables, higher values indicate greater
risk.
Statistical Analyses
We first calculated prevalence estimates and 95% confidence
intervals for PSE, all covariates, and Wave IV outcomes. We then
evaluated associations between PSE and Wave IV outcomes. In
assessing PSE as a marker of negative health outcomes, we
examined both the predictive capacities of PSE measured at Wave
I when respondents were in grades 7­12th and PSE measured at
Wave III when respondents were 18­26 years old. Adults have
more developed risk perceptions compared to adolescents who
overestimate the probability of negative events [33]. Thus, low
PSE at Wave III may be less subject to crude risk perceptions
(compared to Wave I PSE) and may signal severe levels of
hopelessness. We also examined the outcomes of respondents who
reported persistently low PSE at Waves I and III in order to assess
whether this group is particularly vulnerable to detrimental
outcomes in young adulthood.
We investigated the potential effects of Wave I PSE on Wave IV
suicidal ideation and attempt (Study Aim 1) using log-binomial
regression models to calculate relative risks and including all
aforementioned covariates. We investigated the relationship
between Wave III PSE and Wave IV suicidal behavior controlling
for the full set of covariates with Wave III values where available
(i.e., family history of suicide, history of suicide among friends,
block group poverty, depressive symptoms, religiosity, parental
attachment/support, substance use and self-rated health).
Secondly, we investigated the potential impact of Wave I and
Wave III PSE on Wave IV substance use (Study Aim 2). For the
dichotomous outcome variable (i.e., exceeding daily limits for
moderate drinking), we utilized log-binomial regression models to
estimate relative risks. For polytomous outcome variables, we
utilized multinomial logistic regression because the Brant test
showed violations of the proportional odds assumption [34].
Models controlled for all-above specified covariates that were
included in models evaluating the relationship between PSE and
suicide with the exception of self-reported history of suicide among
family and friends­which had negligible impact on effect sizes but
would have reduced the analytic sample size (results not shown). In
order to investigate whether PSE has an enduring effect on
substance use in young adulthood beyond its effects on adolescent
substance use [4], we controlled for previous substance use and
compared with effect estimates without this adjustment.
We tested the statistical significance of sex-by-PSE interactions
in order to evaluate whether the effects of PSE differed for males
and females. Across all examined outcomes, these interactions
were non-significant at the 0.05 level, and thus not included in
final models. Among respondents with valid survey weights,
missing data for PSE and all Wave IV outcomes was ,1%.
Missing data for covariates were also low (generally ,2%). Wave
III parental attachment/support had the highest rate of missing-
ness (5%). The exclusion of individuals with missing data on PSE,
Wave IV outcomes, and covariates resulted in the exclusion of 6­
13% of respondents. All summary statistics were produced using
STATAH/SE 10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and
weighted to be representative of U.S. adolescents in grades 7­12
in the 1994­95 school year.

This analysis was exempt from further review by the Public
Health-Nursing IRB at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
At Wave I, 14% (95% CI: 13, 16) of adolescents in grades 7­12
reported low PSE (i.e., #50% chance of living to age 35) (Table 1).
However at Wave III, when all respondents were 18 years and
older, the proportion reporting low PSE reduced to 7% (95% CI:
7, 8). Approximately 2.3% (95% CI: 1.9, 2.9) of respondents
reported low PSE At Wave I and III (results not shown). At Wave
I, the Add Health population was approximately balanced
between males and females. Most respondents were white (65%)
with large populations of blacks (15%) and Hispanics (11%). About
6% (95% CI: 5, 9) were foreign-born (Table 1). Due to space
limitations, we present descriptive statistics for an abbreviated list
of covariates in Table 1. Descriptive statistics on all covariates are
displayed in Table S2.

At Wave IV, 7.2% of respondents had engaged in suicide
ideation in the past 12 months and 1.6% had attempted suicide
(Table 2). Approximately 1 in 4 were current daily smokers, of
whom about one-third (or 8% of the Add Health Wave IV
population) smoked a pack or more a day. While 12% reported
binge drinking at least weekly, fewer (2.3%) reported exceeding
recommended daily limits for moderate drinking (i.e., up to one
drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men)
[29]. Self-reported past-year marijuana use was relatively common
(23%) and higher than past-year use of other illicit substances
(11%).
PSE as a Predictor of Wave IV Suicidal Behavior
Low PSE at Waves I and III predicted greater risk of suicidal
behavior at Wave IV. Reporting that one had a 50­50 chance or
less of living to age 35 at Wave I or Wave III versus reporting that
one was ``almost certain'' of living to age 35 was associated with
a 29% and 44%, respectively, increase in risk of suicidal ideation
at Wave IV (Table 3). Low PSE at Waves I or III was additionally
related to approximately double the risk of suicide attempt at
Wave IV. Even stronger associations were observed for individuals
who reported persistently low PSE at Waves I and III. Compared
to those who reported high PSE at Waves I and III, individuals
who reported low PSE at both waves had twice the risk of suicidal
ideation (RR: 1.93) and more than three times the risk of suicide
attempt (RR: 3.39) at Wave IV (Table 3).
Substance use has been shown to increase the risk of suicidal
attempts [35]. Nonetheless, associations between PSE and Wave
IV suicidal behavior persisted even after controlling for concurrent
(Wave IV) substance use including marijuana use, other illicit
substance use, binge drinking, heavy drinking, and smoking
(results not shown). In multivariate analyses, Waves I/III de-
pressive symptoms, illicit drug use, history of suicide among family
or friends and experience of physical or sexual child maltreatment
were associated with increased risk of suicide ideation at Wave IV.
Waves I/III illicit drug use and history of suicide among family or
friends predicted suicide attempt at Wave IV (Table S3).
PSE as a Predictor of Wave IV Substance Use
Low PSE was associated with drinking, smoking, and illicit
substance use at Wave IV, but only at relatively high levels of use.
To conserve space, we only show a subset of relationships in
Tables 4 and 5. The uncondensed tables are available in Tables
S4, S5, S6, S7, S8. Associations between PSE and substance use
were moderately attenuated after controlling for previous sub-
stance use. For instance, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for Wave
I PSE #50% not controlling for previous substance use were 1.95,
1.79, and 1.68 for exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking,
smoking at least a pack a day, and using illicit substances other
than marijuana at least weekly, respectively. After controlling for
previous substance use the respective AORs were 1.74, 1.62, and
1.46. Individuals with low PSE at both Waves I and III were about
2 times as likely to exceed daily limits for moderate drinking, 2.5

However, low Wave I (AOR: 0.72) and III PSE (AOR: 0.73)
were related to lower binge drinking at a rate of monthly or less
(Table 5). In multivariate models, younger age, male sex, previous
substance use and lack of religiosity were related to higher
substance use at Wave IV. Blacks were less likely to report
exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking, binge drinking, and
illicit drug use (other than marijuana) than white, non-Hispanics.

Early Death Expectations and Adult Outcomes
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e41905
The patterning of relationships between Waves I/III depressive
symptoms and substance use at Wave IV was similar to that seen
for low PSE. For instance, higher depressive symptoms suggested
greater adjusted odds of smoking at least a pack a day and using
illicit substances other than marijuana at least monthly.
We examined Wave I and Wave III PSE as predictors of actual
mortality risk in young adulthood by assessing ties between PSE
and death occurring between Waves III and IV (n = 131)
(Figure 1). Individuals who reported Wave I PSE #50%
experienced death rates that were double those experienced by
individuals reporting ``almost certain'' (1% vs. 0.5%; crude OR:
1.88; 95% CI: 0.77, 4.56). Wave III PSE #50% was associated
with a more than tripling of the odds of death at Wave IV (1.7%
vs. 0.5%; crude OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.74, 7.90). While controlling
for age, sex, and race/ethnicity attenuated the relationship
between Wave III PSE and Wave IV death, suggestion of strong
relationship remained after adjustment (AOR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.39,
6.48).
Discussion
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
that adolescent expectations of early death can have long-lasting
associations with risk behaviors over a decade later, independent
of depressive symptoms and other important confounding in-
dividual and contextual factors. PSE #50% was linked to
increased suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in young adult-
hood, and these associations persist even after accounting for
depressive symptoms, history of suicide among family and friends,
and concurrent substance use in addition to demographic and
family characteristics. Thus, low PSE may uniquely contribute to
identifying at-risk youth beyond traditionally assessed risk factors.
Moreover, this study is also the first to explore ties between
PSE and varying levels of both legal and illegal substance use.
Detrimental associations between low PSE and increased
substance use were confined to heavy/regular use rather than
occasional or moderate substance use. Specifically, low PSE
predicted smoking at least a pack a day; consuming more than
the recommended daily limits for moderate drinking; and using
illicit substances other than marijuana at least weekly at Wave
IV. Furthermore, ties between PSE and adult substance use
endure even after controlling for previous substance use­
suggesting that PSE may continue to be related to future adult
risk behaviors above-and-beyond its association with adolescent
risk-taking.
Although Wave III PSE was closer in time to Wave IV
outcomes than Wave I PSE, the pattern and magnitude of
associations with Wave IV outcomes were similar for Wave I and
III PSE. However, only low Wave I PSE predicted exceeding the
daily limits for moderate drinking at Wave IV­highlighting the
importance of examining adolescent developmental factors on
adult outcomes [36]. Earlier life factors may be important to the
prediction of adult alcohol use given high rates of experimentation
and opportunity for the development of substance use disorders in
adolescence. For instance, 40% of adult alcoholics experience
symptoms of alcoholism between 15 and 19 [36].
Unexpectedly, in this study we found that low PSE at Wave I
were related to lower frequency of binge drinking. The complexity
of motivational factors underlying substance use may help explain
the patterning of associations. Episodic binge drinking among
young adults may occur with the expectation of positive affective
consequences of drinking. Indeed, social drinking motives (e.g.,
drinking to have fun with friends) are the most commonly
endorsed drinking motives [37]. These drinking motives may be
less prevalent among individuals with low PSE, leading to lower
rates of binge drinking. People with low PSE may be more socially
isolated. In a recent study, Duke and colleagues found that low
PSE at Waves I and II predicted lower odds of prosocial activities
(i.e., hanging out with friends, shopping, creative activities) and
civic engagement (i.e., volunteer/community service, political
activities, voting) at Wave III [8]. Alternatively, drinking to cope
with problems (e.g., avoid or escape from problems) often involves
drinking alone and is most related to the manifestation of drinking
problems and alcohol misuse [37,38,39]. Hence, PSE may predict
only a subset of substance use behaviors (i.e., heavy use rather than
recreational use). Nonetheless, substance use motives were not
assessed in Add Health, and warrant further investigation.

Study Findings in Context
Our results are consistent with nascent literature that links
anticipation of an early death among youth to a broad array of
detrimental outcomes including suicidal behavior, participation in
illegal activities, fight-related injury, and unsafe sexual activity
[2,3,4]. Nevertheless, these studies examined outcomes among
adolescents or individuals in their early twenties. This is the first
study to connect PSE with risk behaviors over a decade later­
important because it suggests that low PSE may have long-lasting
associations with harmful outcomes.
This study also breaks new ground in research examining PSE
and varying types of substance use. An Add Health study found
that adolescents who reported low PSE at Waves I and II were
more likely to report past-year illicit substance use at Wave III
compared to those with high PSE at both waves, although effect
measures fell short of statistical significance [8]. Additionally,
Borowsky et al. found that Wave I PSE was unrelated to past-year
illicit substance use at Waves II and III [4]. Previous Add Health
studies may have had difficulty detecting a relationship between
low PSE and illicit substance use because marijuana, the most
common illicit substance, was not differentiated from other
substances. In addition, level of substance use had only been
examined as any past-year use. We found that low PSE predicted
heavy/regular use of legal and illegal substances rather than low
levels of substance use. We also connected low PSE to Wave IV
death­ which contrasts with the results of an earlier study based on
Add Health data that reported a null relationship between low
Wave I PSE and Wave III death [4]. This earlier study may have
been limited by lower power given that only 96 respondents were
confirmed deceased by Wave III.
In addition to risk behaviors, low PSE has been related to lower
education attainment, personal earnings, physical activity, en-
gagement with the community, self-esteem and life satisfaction
[8,40]. The breadth of ties between low PSE and future outcomes
suggest that its relationship is not specific to one set of outcomes.
Rather low PSE is predictive of many different adverse outcomes.
In addition, the origins of low PSE are diverse­reflecting lived
experiences, exposures, and resources such as violence involve-
ment, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, adult and peer connection
as well as racial/minority status, foreign-birth, and low parental
socioeconomic status [4,32]. Thus potential modes of intervention
on low PSE are diverse.
At Wave I, close to a quarter of youth with parents receiving
public assistance reported low PSE compared to 13% of youth
whose parents did not receive public assistance [4]. Although an
individual's racial status, foreign-birth or family socioeconomic
status cannot be altered or easily changed, the higher prevalence of
low PSE among these groups suggest that designing interventions
which target the healthy youth development of at-risk groups may
narrow health inequities. These interventions may take the form of
mentoring programs that connect youth with professionals in their
prospective career of interest; college-readiness programs; tutoring
programs; after-school recreational programs; summer camp or
a variety of other programs that help keep youths engaged and
support them in the completion of their goals.
Two youth programs that have overwhelming success include
the Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP) and
BUILD. SMYSP organizes an annual, intensive summer residen-
tial program for low-income and minority high school students.
SMYSP participants attend lectures given by Stanford professors,
participate in anatomy labs and hospital internships, and go on
weekly outings with mentors. To date, 100% of SMYSP
participants have graduated high school; 84% have graduated
from 4-year colleges (five times the rate of other low-income youth
in California); and 47% have attended medical school or graduate
school [41]. Alternatively, BUILD is an educational non-profit
combating low high school graduation rates across urban
communities in the United States by ``using entrepreneurship to
excite and empower disengaged, low-income youth through high
school and college success.'' To date, 100% of their program
graduates have completed high school and been accepted to
college [42]. A meta-analysis of mentoring program suggests that
ongoing training of mentors, structured activities, involvement of
parents, and monitoring of program implementation increases
achievement of program goals [43].
Study Strengths and Limitations
Using nationally representative, longitudinal data, this study
found that anticipation of an early death was predictive of select
health risk behaviors 6­13 years later among young adults aged
24­32 years. Nonetheless, this study is subject to several
limitations. We were unable to assess the influence of numeracy
on the reporting of PSE [44]. Our ability to examine the
relationship between PSE and suicidal behavior was constrained
by the exclusion of people who completed suicide. Respondents
self-reported their substance use, which may be subject to under-
reporting. If under-reporting is related to actual substance use
(e.g., if heavier users under-report), this may attenuate observed
relationships between PSE and substance use. However, Add
Health used Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (CASI) on
sensitive questions pertaining to suicide and substance use, which
has been shown to increase reporting of drug use and violence
compared to a more standard self-administered questionnaire
[45]. Moreover, our study focused on the examination of prevalent
substance use behaviors (which are themselves associated with
high health costs) rather than the onset of substance use disorders
at Wave IV. It is possible that loss to follow-up may have biased
observed relationships although the distribution of demographic
characteristics was similar at Wave I and Wave IV, and survey
weights adjust for attrition across waves.
Study Implications
Future areas of research include delineation of how low PSE
relates to future outcomes. In particular, further understanding of
motivational factors for substance use that correlate with low PSE
is needed. Moreover, further research is needed on how to
successfully intervene on low PSE and related psychological factors
associated with worse health outcomes. Beliefs individuals have
about their futures may influence their decision-making. People
with fatalistic perceptions of the future may not see the point of
trying; they may be more reckless with themselves and others.
Anticipation of an early death is not a typical health survey
question. However, its demonstrated prevalence among adoles-
cents and its long-term ties to wide-ranging unfavorable outcomes
suggest it may contribute to identifying at-risk youth beyond
measures of depressive symptoms, individual and family socio-
demographics, and even previous risk behaviors. PSE may be
incorporated into health and counseling sessions with adolescents.
Positive adult connections and increases in self-esteem have been
linked with transitioning out of having expectations of an early
death [46]. Interventions may decrease hopelessness cognitions
and promote positive future orientations by contesting interpreta-
tions of events viewed through a pessimistic inferential style and
aiding in the development of problem-solving and coping abilities
[47]. Efforts to delay the onset of alcohol and drug use during
adolescence; reduce the quantity consumed; and otherwise alter its
pattern of use so as to attenuate its riskiness would lower the
burden of substance use and related outcomes [48]. The emerging
