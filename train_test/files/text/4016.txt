Introduction
There seems to be a consensus among those dealing with
spoken and written English discourse of L1 Arabic users that
the proper use of phrasal verbs is one of the most problematic
linguistic areas for Arab learners of English to master. This
notion was supported by Siyanova and Schmitt (2007) who
stated that one of the most challenging aspects of learning
English vocabulary by non-native speakers is developing
native-like proficiency of phrasal verbs in both spoken and
written English.
As a teacher of English for 7 years at Sohar University,
the first author has observerd this outstanding phenomenon
in the writing of Omani student-teachers of English. Those
students who are going to be teachers of English do not or
rarely use phrasal verbs in their writing, preferring their
equivalent single-word verbs even though the use of phrasal
verbs is more appropriate as they provide vibrancy to dis-
course as they "seem to be a lot more vivid and emphatic
than their single verb counterpart" (Hampe, 2002, p. 110).
This notion was supported by Chen (2007), who stated that
phrasal verbs are frequently used by native speakers of
English because of their "characteristics of flexibility, practi-
cability, adaptability and efficiency" (p. 350). To validate the
researcher's personal observation regarding Omani student-
teachers of English, this study will examine the types and
frequency of the phrasal verbs used by Omani
student-teachers.
Based on what has been stated above, the study sets out to
answer the following questions:
1. Do Omani learners of English use phrasal verbs in
their writing?
2. Do Omani learners of English use certain types of
phrasal verbs and refrain from using other types?
3. Do they use such verbs in the same frequency that
native speakers of English do?
4. Do these learners really avoid using phrasal verbs?
5. Are there any reasons why Omani learners of English
avoid using such verbs?
6. Are there any proposed methods that teachers of
English follow to encourage their students to use
various types of phrasal verbs in their written
discourse?
Phrasal Verbs
Phrasal verbs are intriguing linguistic phenomena as they are
on the interface between the domains of syntax and seman-
tics (Davies, 2009). They are commonly defined as linguistic
units that are engendered from the amalgamation of a verb
proper and a particle that can be an adverb, a preposition, or
both. The meaning of such combinations cannot always be
inferred from the meaning of the verb and the particle

Rarity or Non-Existence of Phrasal Verbs
in the Written Discourse of Omani
Student-Teachers of English

Abstract
This article mainly aims at examining the use of phrasal verbs in the written discourse of Omani student-teachers. The
participants of the study composed of three groups: first-year student-teachers, fourth-year student-teachers, and a group of
native speakers. Two production tests and one recognition test were presented to the participants to find out if they could
produce and recognize phrasal verbs, especially idiomatic ones. The results of the study showed that phrasal verbs were rare
or non-existent in Omani students' writing. Hence, the researchers identified implications and provided recommendations
through which Omani learners of English can be helped to use phrasal verbs efficiently in their communication.

independently. Aldahesh (2009) supports this definition stat-
ing that a phrasal verb is
a combination of two or three items (a verb + a preposition, a
verb + an adverb, or a verb + an adverb + a preposition) which
function as a single unit of meaning in the sense that its meaning
cannot be deduced from the total sum of the meanings of its
separate elements. (p. 1)
Consider the following example:
They did not get on with their mother.
The authors of this article intend to adopt the definition intro-
duced by Gardner and Davies (2007) who proposed a more
functional definition of phrasal verbs stating that two-word
items consisting of a lexical verb and an adverbial particle are
to be considered phrasal verbs. This definition adaptation is
based on the notion that in spite of the many attempts made
by grammarians and linguists to distinguish between phrasal
verbs, prepositional verbs, phrasal-prepositio-nal verbs, and
other multiword verb constructions, these attempts, the
authors believe, are of little instructional value for non-native
learners of English who struggle to master this linguistic area.
Phrasal verbs are commonly divided into three main cat-
egories: non-idiomatic, semi-idiomatic, and fully idiomatic
(Downing & Locke, 2006). Non-idiomatic phrasal verbs are
characterized by their ease of comprehension as the verb and
the particle keep their own meaning, for example,
The brothers carried out the food.
In semi-idiomatic phrasal verbs, the verb keeps its own
literal metaphoric meaning while the particle is utilized as an
aspectual marker of several kinds, for example,
The mother cried out for help.
The meaning of fully idiomatic phrasal verbs (the focus of
this study) is too difficult to derive by only examining their
constituents because of their inherent idiomaticity. For
example, the meaning of the phrasal verb "look + particle" in
the following sentences cannot be deciphered by simply
looking at the constituents:
I will go back to work if I can find somebody to look after my
children.
We have been looking for you everywhere.
Don't look down on them just because they haven't been as
successful as you.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
A committee was set up to look into the causes of the accident.
All we could do was look on as the house burned.
Would you please look up that word in a dictionary?
They have to look up to their parents.
In the above examples, the change of the particle that fol-
lows the verb "look" brings about the change in meaning.
These particles are perceived as adverbial particle because
"they differ from mainstream adverbs in having very little
semantic content" (Börjars & Burridge, 2010, p. 99).
Hence, what causes the difficulty for non-native speakers
of English to utilize idiomatic phrasal verbs is that the mean-
ing of the combination of the verb with the particle cannot
always be inferred from the literal meaning of the verb and
particle independently.
Phrasal verbs like most other English verbs could either
be transitive or intransitive, for example,
The man held up his angry wife.
My car broke down on the side of the road.
The object can also be situated between the verb and the
particle as in
He had wanted to beat this man up for making such an offer.
However, when the object is an unstressed pronoun, it is
predominantly positioned between the verb proper and the
particle as in
Can you put it off?
Intransitive phrasal verbs, whereby the verb is not fol-
lowed by a direct object, are commonly used as directives
and imperatives (Biber, Conrad, & Leech, 2002), for
example,
Come on Jack, let's hit the road and stand up straight.
Moreover, there is a phrasal prepositional verb that con-
sists of a verb (intransitive/transitive) + particle + preposi-
tion, such as "come up with" as in
The student came up with a plan.
Phrasal verbs are vital linguistic repertoire to acquire as
they are "the most productive patterns of the English lan-
guage" (Cubillo, 2002, p. 95) because of the perpetual com-
binations of verb + particle that increase overtime. This is, as
McArthur andAtkins (1974) put it, mainly due to the produc-
tive nature of these kinds of verbs which can emerge at any
time, in any situation, and within any context throughout the
English language. The main reason for such continuous cre-
ation of phrasal verbs, according to McCarthy and O'Dell
Rahman and Abid 3
(2004, p. 144), is due to two fundamental variables, social
change and the need to develop words to describe new phe-
nomena. To support their viewpoint, the writers mentioned
the following examples that have been recently used by
native speakers of English:
After a whole week of birthday celebrations, I feel totally partied
out!
He bigged up that new film, but when I went to see it I was really
disappointed.
They blessed out on music.
I don't really buy into all that homeopathic medicine stuff.
I'll text you back when my meeting finishes.
Sports promoters are trying to sex up cricket for the younger
generation.
Chill out! Life is too short to get so stressed.
The meanings of the above phrasal verbs are "have had
enough of parties," "praise very highly," "become or make
someone become totally happy," "complete in a set of ideas,"
"send a text message in reply," "make something seem more
exciting than it really is," "relax completely, or not allow
things to upset you" respectively.
Phrasal verbs are units that are claimed to be frequently
associated with informal discourse because of their collo-
quial distinctiveness which situates them "at the informal
end of the formal-informal continuum" (Waibel, 2007,
p. 31). McArthur (1992) labeled phrasal verbs as units that
"are often informal, emotive, and slangy, and may often con-
trast with Latinate verbs" (p. 774). Though the frequency of
phrasal verbs in Davies's (2008) the Corpus of Contemporary
American English (COCA) depicts the fact that these verb +
particle combinations are less frequent in academic writing
compared to spoken, fiction, magazine, and newspapers
(Figure 1), this does not make phrasal verbs rare in written
discourse. This is because the total number of phrasal verbs
in native speakers' diverse written forms (fiction, magazine,
newspaper, and academic) exceeds the number used in the
spoken discourse (Figure 2). The utilization of COCA by the
researchers is based on the notion that it provides us with
real-life language use of native speakers of English. COCA
has been used by many researchers due to its dynamic archi-
tecture and rich database. This, in turn, increases the reliabil-
ity of the results that researches, including the present one,
endeavor to reach.
The authors of this article believe that as phrasal verbs
play an indispensable role in communication, they are fre-
quently used by native speakers of English both in speaking
and writing. A number of recent empirical studies such as
Trebits (2008), Chen (2007), and Gardner and Davies (2007)
analyzed the writing of native speakers of English and after a
thorough analysis of these written texts, they found out that
phrasal verbs are frequently used in the written communica-
tion of native speakers of English. The authors of this article
have also arrived at the same conclusion. Though many
grammarians and linguists assert that phrasal verbs are
largely used in spoken language, none of the English written
texts the authors have gone through is characterized by the
non-existence of phrasal verbs.
Studies on Phrasal Verbs
There are several studies that examined the use of phrasal
verbs by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or English as
a Second Language (ESL) learners. For instance, Yoshitomi
(2006) explored the use of phrasal verbs by Japanese learners
of English. The researcher concluded that phrasal verbs are
used by native speakers more frequently than the EFL and
ESL Japanese learners did. Semantically transparent phrasal
verbs were used more often than semantically opaque phrasal
verbs. Furthermore, the results also showed that ESL learn-
ers differ from EFL learners in their tendency to employ
phrasal verbs in a native-like way. Uchida (2012) examined
the implementation of phrasal verbs by EFL Japanese learn-
ers. The results indicated that Japanese EFL learners tend to
employ semantically transparent phrasal verbs more than
semantically opaque ones. However, the frequency of phrasal
verbs tends to increase gradually with the increase of profi-
ciency levels.
It is fundamental to note that the majority of the studies
that examined phrasal verbs in the language of EFL and ESL
learners encountered the phenomenon of avoidance of these

multiword verbs. Schachter (1974) was the first linguist who
uncovered the strategy of avoidance manipulated by learners
when they find a structure difficult to use. Schachter stated,
"If a student finds a particular construction in the target lan-
guage difficult to comprehend, it is very likely that he will
try to avoid producing it" (p. 213). She further criticized
Error Analysis of being deficient in second language acquisi-
tion as it was unable to discover avoidance phenomenon. An
interpretation of the term avoidance was presented by
Kleinmann (1977) who supported Schachter stating that it is
a strategy usually resorted to by L2 learners when they per-
ceive that it is difficult to produce a specific target language
word or structure though they have already been exposed to
it. However, Schachter and his proponents did not highlight
the fact that the strategy of avoidance might be the result of
the learner's complete ignorance of the structure rather than
conscious avoidance. Studies that examined the avoidance of
phrasal verbs include Liao and Fukuya (2004) who studied
the phenomenon of avoidance in the discourse of Chinese
learners of English. The results of the study showed phrasal
verbs are predominantly avoided and both intermediate and
advanced-level learners produce less figurative phrasal
verbs. Kweon (2006) studied the use of phrasal verbs by
Korean EFL learners. The researcher concluded that the
avoidance behavior of Korean EFL learners is influenced by
"differences between first and second language, the inherent
semantic difficulty of phrasal verbs, and developmental
framework of interlanguage processes" (Kweon, 2006,
p. 175). The use of phrasal verbs by Iraqi undergraduate stu-
dents in the Department of English Studies in Kirkuk
University was studied by Mohammed (2010).The researcher
indicated that avoidance is a distinctive feature of the Iraqi
students' writings and it is determined by the level of the
phrasal verb complexity, that is, the less transparent the
phrasal verb is, the more it is avoided. Sara and
Mohammadreza (2013) examined the use of phrasal verbs by
Persian EFL learners. The results of the study indicated that
the participants avoid using phrasal verbs, and the level of
the semantic complexity of the phrasal verbs dictates the
occurrence of avoidance in the student's writings.
Kharitonova (2013) examined the use of phrasal verbs by
Russian and Norwegian learners of English. The results also
showed that avoidance does exist and that negative L1 trans-
fer also occurs whereby students employ phrasal verbs from
their mother tongue that have an erroneous meaning in
English.
Method
Participants
The sample of the study is composed of three groups. The
first group includes first-year students who join the English
Department at Sohar University after completing their foun-
dation year; the second group consists of fourth-year
students who have already finished their foundation year and
seven semesters. A group of native speakers of English who
teach at Sohar University in different departments composes
the third group. The purpose of choosing first- and fourth-
year students is to find out how far their knowledge of phrasal
verbs is different due to their different levels of proficiency.
Design of the Study
The study underwent four procedures that revolve around
two test types: recognition and production. The recognition
test (seeAppendixA) was devised to find out how far the two
groups of students are able to recognize the phrasal verbs
implemented by an English professional writer in a written
text. The text in which 17 phrasal verbs are used was given
to the two groups to underline all the phrasal verbs used by
the writer. A 1-hr period was given to the students to com-
plete the task.
On the production level of the test, the fourth-year stu-
dents and the native speakers of English were asked to write
an essay of about three hundred words on "A Day to
Remember" to find out how frequently they use phrasal
verbs in their written discourse. The participants were given
1 week to complete the task. It is fundamental to note that the
students were strongly encouraged to solely rely on them-
selves so that remedial aid will be provided to help them in
their writing. A comparison between the two groups' written
texts was subsequently conducted to find out the types and
frequency of phrasal verbs they used in their essays.
Moreover, a group of fourth-year students were asked to
choose the right phrasal verb from a group of phrasal verbs
given to them (see Appendix B) to find out if they could use
them properly after they had been exposed to them. A 2-hr
period was given to the students to complete the task.
It is crucial to mention that in the recognition as well as
production tests, explicit verbal instructions were given to
the participants as well as a summary of the instructions was
provided in each task to facilitate the participants' compre-
hension of the tasks presented to them.
Discussion of Results
After investigating the underlined phrasal verbs by the two
groups in the recognition test, the results are presented in
Table 1.
Table 1 shows that the second group performed much bet-
ter than the first group. While 159 phrasal verbs were recog-
nized by the first group, 285 phrasal verbs were recognized
by the second group. Moreover, some participants of both
groups underlined some constructions which are also com-
posed of verbs and prepositions thinking that they are phrasal
verbs, but they are not. It is obvious that the second group is
more proficient in English than the first group because of the
longer period that they have been studying English. These
results are in line with Sara and Mohammadreza's (2013)
Rahman and Abid 5
who emphasized that the frequency of phrasal verbs used by
the students is dictated by their proficiency levels.
Furthermore, Uchida (2012) indicated that the frequency of
phrasal verbs increases gradually with the increase of profi-
ciency levels. Figure 3 represents the results of the recogni-
tion test:
In the production test, the participants (fourth-year stu-
dents and native speakers) were asked to write a three-
paragraph essay on "A Day to Remember." The first-year
students were not asked to do this test because of their poor
performance in the recognition test compared with the
fourth-year students. Thus, the authors believe that focusing
on the fourth-year students will be sufficient to understand
their level of comprehension of phrasal verbs. After a thor-
ough analysis of the essays, the results are noted in Table 2.
Table 2 shows that both native speakers and the students
did not use many phrasal verbs in their writing. This is com-
patible with what was previously stated by many scholars that
phrasal verbs are used informally in spoken language.
However, when both groups' usage of types of phrasal verbs
was examined, students are more inclined to use non-
idiomatic phrasal verbs whereas native speakers tend to use
idiomatic ones. This phenomenon is supported by various
researchers. Yoshitomi (2006) also emphasized that non-native
learners of English tend to use semantically transparent phrasal
verbs rather than the semantically opaque phrasal verbs. To
understand this phenomenon, many texts written by profes-
sional writers were examined and, surprisingly, they show a
tendency to use as many idiomatic phrasal verbs as possible.
One of the writers (Alexander, 1964) wrote an essay that has
the same title "A Day to Remember." He used 17 idiomatic
phrasal verbs in his three short paragraph essay. This gives an
impression that using idiomatic phrasal verbs in writing by
professional writers is a feature of this type of writing.
To examine whether the differences between the two
groups' implementation of phrasal verbs is significant, a
two-tailed t test with two samples assuming unequal vari-
ances was conducted. The Table 3 represents the findings of
the t test.
The results of the t-test statistics, t = 4.53, df = 43, p < .05,
indicate a significant variation in the use of phrasal verbs by
native speakers and fourth-year students due to the fact that
the native speakers used more phrasal verbs than the students
did. To elucidate this phenomenon, the authors randomly
selected 15 essay papers written by the student participants
and examined their contents. The examination indicated that
students rarely use phrasal verbs to an extent that there are
some essays that have not a single phrasal verb. Moreover,
there are instances in which the phrasal verbs are grammati-
cally correctly used, but it is semantically inappropriate, for
example, "I put my step in a new house." Table 4 illustrates
the analysis.
After correcting all the answer sheets of the second part of
the production test (fill in the blanks), Table 5 is presented.
Again, Table 4 shows the poor performance of Level 4
students even though the list of phrasal verbs given to them
represents a list of the 50 most frequently used phrasal verbs
in native speakers' academic writing. The list, retrieved from
COCA, includes phrasal verbs given in Table 6.
A majority of students do not know how to use phrasal
verbs even when provided with a list of them. The poor per-
formance of the participants in this part of the test is expected

due to the fact that the non-existence of such verbs in the
learner's repertoire causes him/her to lack adequate strate-
gies to recognize and process them. This means that the
avoidance strategy adopted by these learners simply resulted
from their ignorance of this structure. Consequently, the phe-
nomenon of avoidance of phrasal verbs arrived at by a
number of researchers such as Sara and Mohammadreza
(2013), Kharitonova (2013), Mohammed (2010), Chen
(2007), Liao and Fukuya (2004) and Dagut and Laufer
(1985), the authors believe, is inapplicable to this study.
Pedagogical Implications
The lackluster performance of the participants in the three
types of the test indicates why those learners find it difficult
to use phrasal verbs in their written discourse. A cause of this
is likely the limited exposure of the students to English
phrasal verbs in the Omani school English syllabus that is
called "English For Me." English For Me, which is a set of
48 books, is made up of 2 course books and 2 workbooks for
each of the 12 school years. Hence, the researchers reviewed
all 48 books to examine the type and frequency of phrasal
verbs and they found out that only one exercise in Grade 8/B
page 23 deals with phrasal verbs under the title "Language
Focus" and is presented in Figure 4.
This is the only activity that focuses on the use of multi-
word verbs (phrasal verbs) during the 12 years in which stu-
dents study English. The designers of the program even
avoid using the term phrasal verbs in the exercise. Thus,
Omani learners of English can hardly be familiar with phrasal
verbs when using them in their spoken and written discourse.
The syllabus Omani students are exposed to is in no way suf-
ficient to help them use and acquire the various types of
phrasal verbs in their spoken and written English. In this
regard, many scholars like Gardner and Davies (2007),
Gilmore (2004), Nesselhauf (2003), and Biber, Conrad, and

Reppen (1998) criticized learners' syllabi that are not based
on research findings because the decisions about what to
include in those syllabi are usually based on the author's gut-
level impressions and anecdotal evidence of how speakers
and writers use the language.
Conclusions and Recommendations
This study examined the use of phrasal verbs in the written
discourse of Omani student-teachers. The analysis of the
results of the participant's performance clearly shows that
phrasal verbs pose problems even for advanced learners.
Nonetheless, the issue is especially evident in the Omani
student-teachers who learn English in a foreign language
learning setting where the class is the only opportunity for
the learners to study and practice English. The scarcity or
non-existence of phrasal verbs in the writing of these learn-
ers of English means that "about one third of the English
verb vocabulary" (Li et al., 2003, p. 513) is practically not a
part of the learners' repertoire. In addition, the learners'
Figure 4. The language focus exercise Grade 8/B text book.
8 SAGE Open
incapacity to use phrasal verbs means that these learners will
miss out on the growing number of phrasal verbs with new
combinations appearing every year (Villavicencio &
Copestake, 2002).
It seems evident that the students, unlike the natives, pre-
fer to use single-word verbs to phrasal verbs especially idi-
omatic ones though the use of the latter is more appropriate.
The result of this tendency is the absence or rarity of these
verbs in their writing. Moreover, though native speakers of
English do not show the inclination to frequently use these
verbs, they, unlike Omani learners of English who com-
monly use non-idiomatic ones, use idiomatic phrasal verbs
more than non-idiomatic ones.
The retrieved results lead to the recommendation that
phrasal verbs should be given special emphasis with the aim
of enabling the learners to achieve an effective and efficient
communication in the English-speaking community. This
can be achieved via modifying the syllabus to include the
manner in which the most common phrasal verbs are used by
native speakers in their everyday language. As phrasal verbs
are inevitable in native speakers' communication for their
flexibility, practicability, and efficiency, it is, therefore, rec-
ommended that the elements of any Omani syllabus should
be selected according to empirical corpus-based research
findings to help in compiling a selection of naturally occur-
ring language that can be very useful for teaching both spo-
ken and written English. Selecting items for a syllabus,
therefore, should not be in any way based on teachers' and
linguists' intuition however experienced they are.
As such, this study has shown the difficulty Arabic L1
users commonly face in using phrasal verbs in their English
written discourse, and how in particular their use of such
verbs is in need of attention. Further research needs to be
done into the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching
these verbs, especially idiomatic ones, as it is clear that cur-
rent product-based approaches are not equipping our stu-
dents with the ability to use them. In this regard, the writers
believe that the downward and upward approach recom-
mended by Chen (2007) appears very relevant. The down-
ward approach stresses the teaching of the components of
phrasal verbs which students are familiar with. This is a psy-
chologically strategic step by which learners feel that phrasal
verbs involve nothing difficult, hence, they will be more con-
fident to learn them. The upward approach is then applied via
introducing the phrasal verbs that are used in daily
communication.
Appendix A
Recognition Test
Read the following passage and underline all phrasal
verbs:
We have all experienced days when everything goes
wrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly every-
thing seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is
that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely
the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up
a chain of reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a
meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The
telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen
series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby
pulls the table-cloth off the table, smashing half your best
crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up
hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the
meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to
tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three
guests to dinner.
Things can go wrong on a big scale as a number of people
recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.
During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both
drivers began to argue. The woman immediately behind the
two cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into
panic and stopped her car. This made the driver following her
brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large
cake.As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through
the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying
through the air, a lorry-driver who was drawing up alongside
the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with
empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of
the vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry
argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the
police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. In
the meantime, the lorry-driver had to sweep up hundreds of
broken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefitted from all this
confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the
cake. It was just one of those days!
