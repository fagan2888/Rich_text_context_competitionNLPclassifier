CONTEXT: The prevalence of overweight (OW) among children in the United States has increased during the last three decades,
but prevalence measures fail to reveal the extent to which OW children exceed the OW threshold.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the amount by which OW children exceed the OW threshold. To examine the trend in this measure
over the last three decades using data with measured weights and heights.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data used for analysis are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) for persons between 2 and 19 y of age from 1971 to 2000. Anthropometric measures were obtained by trained
health technicians, and the sample sizes range from 4037 in 1999­2000 to 10 590 in 1988­1994.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The extent of OW is measured as the average amount by which each child's body mass index
(BMI) exceeds their age and gender-specific OW threshold. This measure is examined by sex, age group and race/ethnicity. The
OW threshold for those aged 2­19 y is defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific BMI for age growth charts.
RESULTS: The extent of child OW has been increasing faster than the prevalence of child OW for all classifications considered in
this paper, including the analysis by age, sex, race and ethnicity. The prevalence of OW for children aged 2­19 y increased by
182% between 1971­1971 and 1999­2000, while the extent of OW increased by 247% over the same time period.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike prevalence measures, the measure of the extent of child OW is sensitive to changes in the BMI
distribution of the overweight. This analysis reveals that not only have more children become OW in the last three decades, but
OW children have been getting heavier.

Introduction
Data from the 1999­2000 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that the overweight
(OW) prevalence in US children and adolescents has
continued to increase through the 1990s.1 OW prevalence
for children between the ages of 2 and 19 y was 10% in 1988­
1994 (age-adjusted to 2000 Census population estimates)
and this increased to 14.4% by 1999­2000. OW children face
increased risk of morbidity from coronary heart disease,
hypertension and diabetes mellitus;2­4 and children who are
OW are more likely to become OW adults.5,6 Owing to the
increasing prevalence of both child and adult OW, the
Surgeon General reports that being OW could soon overtake
tobacco usage as the primary cause of preventable death in
the United States.7,8
A child or adolescent is considered OW if their body mass
index (BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters) is at or above the 95th percentile
of the revised 2000 Center for Disease Control (CDC), sex-
specific BMI for age growth charts.9 The CDC growth charts
for children and adolescents are based on nationally
representative data obtained from five surveys conducted
between 1963 and 1994 (cycles II and III of the National
Health and Examination Survey and rounds I, II and III of
the NHANES).
Prevalence indices describe the proportion of OW children
in the population, but provide no information on the extent
to which they exceed the threshold. Research indicates that
the risks of health problems for adults associated with being
OW are increasing in BMI (or in other words, someone who
is 50% OW faces greater health risks than someone who is
10% OW).10­12 For example, the risk of heart failure increases
5% in adult men and 7% in adult women with a unit

associated with a 6% increase in the relative risks of total,
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke for men.12 As prevalence
indices censor all information about the distribution of BMI,
except whether it is above or below the OW cutoff, they
mask important information about the extent of the health
problem. While research has not directly shown that health
risks are also increasing in BMI for children and adolescents,
this paper assumes that the evidence for adults warrants
concern about the BMI distribution of overweight children.
The purpose of this paper is to describe a measure of OW
that provides information on both the prevalence and
extent (the extent to which BMI exceeds the OW threshold)
of child OW. This measure can help to establish whether
the prevalence of child OW sufficiently describes the
health problem or if there is more to be learned from a
measure that is sensitive to changes in the BMI distribution
of the OW.
Methods
The data used in this paper are from four rounds of the
NHANES, which is conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The NHANES samples are representative of the
US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, and observa-
tions were selected following a stratified, multistage design.
Measures of child overweight are estimated at four points in
time: 1971­1974 (NHANES I), 1976­1980 (NHANES II),
1988­1994 (NHANES III) and 1999­2000 (2-y cycle
NHANES). Anthropometric measures were obtained by
trained health technicians, and effective sample sizes of
children and adolescents between 2 and 19 y of age range
from 4037 in 1999­2000 to 10 590 in 1988­1994 (NHANES
III).
To measure the extent of child OW, this paper considers
the following index:
EOW ¼ ð1=nÞ
X
i
IðBMIi
! fi
Þ½ðBMIi
À fi
Þ=fi
 ð1Þ
where n is the sample size, i subscripts the child, f is the
cutoff point identifying who is overweight and I is an
indicator function that takes a value of 1 if the statement is
true and 0 otherwise. More specifically, the indicator
function will take a value of 1 if the child is OW and 0 if
the child's BMI is less than the 95th percentile of the sex-
specific BMI for age growth charts. This paper also examines
children and adolescents who are at risk of being OW, in
which case the 85th percentile is used as the threshold value
for fi
.
I refer to the term in square brackets, [(BMIi
-fi
)/fi
], as the
proportionate OW gap because it measures the amount by
which each OW child's BMI exceeds their OW threshold, and
this amount is expressed as a proportion of the threshold.
Examination of this term reveals that EOW treats BMI as a
continuous variable for the OW population. It embeds the
assumption that public health worsens as average BMI
increases in the OW population. This is in contrast to the
prevalence measure which views OW as a dichotomous
outcome, and is not sensitive to the extent to which the
EOW exceeds their threshold. Expressing excess BMI as a
proportion of the OW threshold is particularly important for
children since the threshold varies by age and sex. The
resulting measure, EOW, is the sum of the proportionate OW
gaps divided by the sample size, or the sample average value
of the proportionate OW gaps. (In the case where BMI is less
than the threshold, the indicator function is 0, and so too is
the product of the two terms.)
To illustrate this measure, consider, for example, an 8-y-
old boy with a BMI of 22. His OW threshold is approximately
20, and his proportionate OW gap is 10%. Consider now
another boy with a BMI of 22, but this one is 9 y old instead
of 8. This older boy has an OW threshold of about 21 and his
proportionate OW gap would be just under 5%. An
examination of the prevalence of child OW would register
both of these boys as OW, and both would contribute equally
to the prevalence measure. In contrast, the EOW measure
captures the fact that the 8-y-old boy is more OW than the 9-
y-old boy, and thereby provides a measure of the extent of
the OW problem. The EOW measure will increase when the
prevalence of OW increases, but unlike the prevalence
measure, it will also increase when those OW becomes
heavier on average.
The usefulness of this measure can further be illustrated by
considering an OW person who gains weight. This weight
gain has no effect on the OW prevalence, but the health of
this person has changed and this change is reflected through
an increase in EOW. In terms of describing the magnitude of
the public-health problem and in shaping public-health
policy, EOW provides important information. For example,
consider a hypothetical health policy that focused on
helping the extremely OW lose weight. If successful, this
policy would result in an improvement in public health,
which would be indicated by a lowering of EOW, but there
might very well be no change in the prevalence measure.
The average extent of OW for the entire population, EOW,
when combined with information about the prevalence of
OW, additionally provides insight into the extent of OW for
the OW population. The interpretation of the ratio of EOW
to prevalence can be seen by noting that the EOW measure is
the sample sum of the proportionate OW gaps divided by the
entire sample size, n. The OW prevalence measure can be
expressed as the number of OW in the sample, say nj
, divided
by the sample size n. Dividing EOW by the OW prevalence
results in the sum of the proportionate OW gaps divided by
nj
, the sample size of those who are OW. This ratio is then the
average proportionate amount by which the OW exceed
their BMI threshold.
For example, if this ratio is equal to 0.15 this means that,
on average, the OW are 15% percent in excess of their
thresholds. Increases in this measure indicate that the OW
are becoming increasingly OW on average. As a measure of
the public-health problem though (and in contrast to EOW),

this measure has the undesirable characteristic that it is not
monotonically increasing in BMI. For example, if a child's
BMI increases and moves from being classified as not OW to
OW, then EOW will increase. The average amount by which
the OW exceed their threshold may actually decline though,
because this new OW child will likely bring down the
average value of excess BMI of the OW. Nonetheless, when
combined with information about the prevalence and extent
of OW, this ratio readily conveys important information
about the BMI distribution of the OW population. It is useful
to note that an alternative method of treating BMI as a
continuous variable would be to plot out and compare shifts
in the BMI distribution over time. A comparison of NHANES
II and NHANES III illustrates that indeed the entire BMI
distribution appears to be shifted to the right between 1976
and 1994.13
Results
Tables 1­4 provide weighted estimates of EOW, the OW
prevalence, and the ratio of these two measures. The sample
weights reflect the unequal probability of selection resulting
from the sample design (including corrections for over-
sampling) and also correct for nonresponse. All standard
errors correct for the stratified and multistage nature of
the sample design. Estimates from NHANES I, II and III
are based on the NHANES pseudo-strata and pseudo-PSUs.14
In the case of the NHANES 1999­2000 cycle, no pseudo-
design variables are yet available in these files, so the
standard errors are derived following the method of
balanced repeated replication with Fay's adjustment para-
meter set to 0.8.15
Table 1 presents estimates of OW and at risk of being OW
for ages 2­19 y. At risk of OW is defined as having a BMI at or
above the 85th percentile of the sex-specific BMI for age
growth charts. The estimates are age-standardized by the
direct method to the 2000 population estimates to adjust for
the changing distribution of age over the decades. The
patterns of change for OW and at risk of OW are similar.
During the 1970s there was little change, with the OW
prevalence around 5% and the at-risk-of-OW prevalence at
15%. During the 1980s and 1990s both measures increased
dramatically. By 1999­2000, 14.4% of children and adoles-
cents were OW and 28.4% were at risk of being OW.
While this significant increase in both prevalence mea-
sures is alarming, the increase in the extent of OW was larger.
Between 1971­1974 and 1999­2000, the OW prevalence
increased by 182% while the extent of OW increased by
247%. The increasing extent of OW has resulted both
from the increasing prevalence and also from noting
that, in 1971­1974, OW children were on average 12% in
excess of their thresholds. By 1999­2000, OW children
were 14% in excess of their thresholds. The increasing
extent of OW indicates that the health risks associated
with excess adipose are likely even greater than that
indicated by the increased prevalence rates. More children
are becoming OW, and these OW children are getting
heavier on average.
The same phenomenon is occurring with at risk of OW.
The extent of this measure increased at more than twice the
pace of the increase in the prevalence rate. Again, this result
is driven by both the increasing at-risk-of-OW prevalence
and a mean shift in the BMI distribution of the at-risk
children. In 1971­1974, those children who were at risk of
being OW were on average 12% over their at-risk thresholds
(85th percentiles of the sex-specific BMI for age growth
charts). By 1999­2000, the at-risk children were on average
18% in excess of their thresholds. The fast-paced growth of

with the greatest increase in prevalence for those between
the ages of 6 and 11 y. For each age category, the extent of
OW increased at a rate faster than the increasing prevalence.
The increase in the average amount by which OW children
exceed their threshold was relatively small, increasing from 8
to 9% for ages 2­5 y and from 11 to 13% for ages 6­11 y. The
largest increase in this measure is for adolescents between
the ages of 12 and 19 y. In 1971­1974 (and 1976­1980), OW
adolescents were on average 13% in excess of their OW
thresholds, and by 1999­2000 this increased to 17%.
Breaking out adolescents by sex provides a further example
of the usefulness of examining the extent of OW. The change
in OW prevalence between 1971­1974 and 1999­2000 was
very similar for male and female adolescents. Both rates were
slightly higher than 6% in the early 1970s and both were
15.5% in 1999­2000, suggesting essentially no sex differ-
ences in adolescent OW. The measure of the extent of OW,
though, reveals that there have been important differences.
In the early 1970s, male adolescents had a lower extent of
OW than female. An implication of this is that in 1971­1974,
OW male adolescents were on average 11% in excess of their
OW threshold, while OW female adolescents were much
more OW on average (15% in excess of their thresholds). By
1999­2000, this sex difference vanished and OW adolescent
boys were slightly more OW than adolescent girls. This
relative change in the sex distribution of the extent of OW is
readily observed by noting that the growth rate of EOW for
adolescent boys was 293% compared to 165% for adolescent
girls between 1971­1974 and 1999­2000.
Table 4 provides a final example of the additional
information gained from the measure of the extent of OW.
An analysis of the prevalence of adolescent OW by race and
ethnicity indicates that non-Hispanic blacks have the high-
est prevalence (23.6%) with a rate that is just less than twice
the rate for non-Hispanic whites (12.7%). The measure of the
extent of OW for non-Hispanic blacks is more than 2.8 times
the measure of extent for non-Hispanic whites. These
measures reveal that OW non-Hispanic blacks are on average
23% in excess of their OW threshold, while this figure for
non-Hispanic whites is much lower at 15%. The OW
prevalence measure indicates that this health problem is
more pervasive for non-Hispanic blacks than for Hispanics
and non-Hispanic whites, and the measure of the extent
indicates that the health issues associated with being OW are
likely to be more severe for non-Hispanic blacks.
Conclusion
This paper examines children and considers a measure of
OW that is sensitive to both changes in the prevalence of

OW and also to changes in the BMI distribution of the OW.
This measure, EOW, is referred to as the extent of OW
because it measures the average amount by which the
population exceeds the OW threshold. While previous
research has shown that the prevalence of child OW has
increased between 1971­1974 and 1999­2000, the extent of
OW has been increasing at a faster rate. In other words, not
only has the proportion of OW children been increasing, but
it is also the case that OW children have been getting
steadily more OW. The extent of child OW has been
increasing faster than the prevalence of child OW for all
classifications considered in this paper, including the
analysis by age, sex, race and ethnicity.
Research indicates that health risks for adults are increas-
ing in BMI and therefore shifts in the BMI distribution of
OW adults have important health implications. The research
in this paper indicates that there have been large shifts in the
BMI distribution of OW children that the OW prevalence
does not fully reveal. This finding suggests that future
research into the health consequences of child and adoles-
cent OW would add useful insights by examining whether
health risks for children are increasing in BMI, as they are for
adults. If this is the case, then the implication of the results
in this paper is that the public-health problem of child OW is
even greater than that revealed by the increasing OW
prevalence rates.
