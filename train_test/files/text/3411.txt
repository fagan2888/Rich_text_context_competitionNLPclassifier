Special Issue - Traditional Wisdom
Introduction
The aim of this article is to present current theories on com-
munity-based ecotourism and tourism planning, as well as
try to connect them with the traditional wisdom of rural
communities.
The interests of the community within tourism develop-
ment have been a topic since the nineties of the 20th century.
After a wave of "advocacy tourism platforms" (Jafari, 1990),
in which only the positive economic effects of tourism devel-
opment were considered, major negative changes in social
and cultural elements of destination communities became
apparent. Attempts were made to mitigate these negative
changes through the inclusion of as much of each respective
community as possible into both planning and active partici-
pation in the tourism industry. Gradually, over the past 20
years, the importance of community has become a key factor
in tourism planning, which has led to coining the term "com-
munity-based tourism" (CBT) describing a concept of tour-
ism that is based on local human and natural resources,
"managed and owned by the community, for the community,
with the purpose of enabling visitors to increase their aware-
ness and learn about the community and local ways of life"
(The Thailand Community Based Institute, 2013). Such a
concept declares that the local community could be involved
in tourism in two primary ways--through profit distribution

The Importance of Documenting
and Including Traditional Wisdom in
Community-Based Ecotourism Planning:
A Case Study of the Nature Park
Ponjavica in the Village of Omoljica
(Serbia)
Vesna uki1 and Ivana Voli2
Abstract
This article accords to the theory of community-based tourism, which represents a concept that respects natural and
cultural resources of a particular community and encourages participation of its members in the process of tourist product
creation. The article operates in the planning phase and aims to give insights into the process of establishing the groundwork
for community-based tourism. The key element is documenting and illustrating everything that could be a part of what is
known as "traditional wisdom," namely, the skills and knowledge of traditional life practices. The methods of case study,
content analysis, and observation of the village of Omoljica, Serbia, were used. The positive aspect of this locality is reflected
in the existing short-term initiatives of organizations and individuals engaging in preserving traditional practices, but without
systematic, long-term planning and management of community-based tourism, these individual efforts to revalue traditional
life practices would stay unrecognizable and invisible for visitors and stakeholders. Thus, the main goal of this article is to
understand the relation between short-term bottom-up initiatives and long-term top-down strategic planning of specific
ecotourism destinations, one that would embrace the traditional ways of rural community life. The contribution of this study,
in addition to documenting and illustrating "traditional wisdom" of the specific rural community placed in the protected area
which encompasses a particular local social system, will be reflected in the creation of a set of guidelines for sustainable, rural,
community-based ecotourism as a soft-driver development of protected areas near big cities of the postsocialist countries.

and decision making. Both aspects are vital for community
well-being, though challenging to achieve.
In this article, we will examine the particular case study of
the Nature Park Ponjavica and the village Omoljica, which
falls within the territory of the administrative, industrial, cul-
tural center of the Southern Banat Province of Serbia and the
city of Pancevo. With this aim in mind, we address the spe-
cifics of a region that contains both natural and cultural
assets, and which is additionally situated within a postsocial-
ist society in transition that has its own characteristics regard-
ing the relations of culture and nature. Underdevelopment
and isolation from main economic centers has positively
contributed to the preserving of nature and traditional ways
of life in this community. This could be considered an advan-
tage, especially in the context of the contemporary urban
industrial crisis in the developed world. In addition, from a
planning and development perspective, the well-preserved
nature and traditional ways of life could be treated as an
opportunity for the better appreciation of repressed notional
concepts representing the polar opposite of the developed
world's dychotomy (a focus on interior culture, endogenous
development, rural communities); a rediscovering of values
within those concepts that are worth reviving, as well as
incorporating such concepts into contemporary development
strategies. The key question being raised in this article is,
"Could tourism be a soft-driver development, one that would
embrace the traditional ways of rural community life?" Main
goal of this article is to understand relation between bottom-
up initiatives of the civil sector and top-down strategic plan-
ning and management of specific ecotourism destinations
who decide to activate traditional ways of rural community
life for tourists and visitors.
For this case study, the Nature Park Ponjavica in the
Village of Omoljica (Serbia) has been chosen as a locality
that offers both natural and cultural resources, where old
practices are still actively employed, but rarely considered as
an asset that could be valued for future development. The
answer to the question raised in this article is complex and, at
this phase, rather unclear. This article attempts to establish
some key issues related to community-based ecotourism
planning, with special reference to the documenting of tradi-
tional practices that could be of value both in the contempo-
rary life of today's rural communities, as well as in
responsible, CBT development.
Theoretical Framework
This article is grounded on the theoretical concepts of com-
munity-based ecotourism, tourism planning, and postsocial-
ist transitional society, and how these concepts relate to
traditional wisdom based on sustainable land and water use
practices.
Community tourism development is a concept "proposed
in the context of sustainable development" (World Tourism
Organization [UNWTO], 2008, p. 2). Namely, it stems out of
the "adoptancy platform" which Jafari (1990) has recognized
as a third platform within which tourism as a social activity
has been operating. The first platform was the "advocacy
platform," related to the rapid tourism development of the
seventh decade of 20th century. Tourism was seen as a means
of economic progress for destinations and tourism operators,
without any stance regarding its development. After two
decades of tourism development, negative sociocultural and
ecological effects had been noticed (demonstration effect,
acculturation, pollution due to mass transportation, and
demands for tourist destination's adaptations for tourist's
needs). After this period of uncontrolled development, more
voices were risen against tourism (especially its environmen-
tal impacts), and more researchers in the tourism field were
addressing the negative consequences of tourism develop-
ment (Doxey, 1976; Murphy, 1983; Pearce, 1977, 1982;
Wall, 1982, 1997; Wallace, 1993). Jafari describes this sec-
ond platform as a "cautionary platform." Following these
two platforms, the third, more balanced "adaptancy plat-
form" occurred, which represented "an attempt to avoid the
extremes of the first two platforms with their contradictory
arguments by positing alternative tourism development
models" (UNWTO, 2008, p. 2). Arguments have been made
that "both ecotourism and community-based tourism grew
out of this `adaptancy platform'" (UNWTO, 2008, p. 2).
Such arguments appear to be applicable, since the first
"advocacy platform" was characterized by tourism develop-
ment without regard for the communities, their local charac-
teristics, and their traditions. On the contrary, the "cautionary
platform" prioritized raising awareness of the degrading,
negative effects that tourism can invoke. At this point in
time, we can use all of the advantages of each of the previous
scenarios--having insights into what effects uncontrolled
tourism development can bring about, while at the same time
being aware of the importance of developing appreciation of
traditional living practices of local communities.
We should bear in mind that the platforms mentioned
relate to the highly developed tourist environments of South
and Western Europe, Northern America, and South-East
Asia. In contrast, in the Balkans, there are communities that
are not yet "touristically" active, or industrially developed.
They stand somewhere "in between"--modernization and
traditional practices existing in a sort of vacuum of time and
space, not celebrated enough to be commercialized, yet not
completely neglected or abandoned. This position could be a
positive starting point, since there are decades of touristic
practices and theories which could be used as lessons in tour-
ism development, as we may be able to avoid past pratfalls
and adverse activities.
Community-Based Ecotourism
The renewed interest in the community as a basic unit of
tourism development, management, planning, and marketing
can be traced to the changing meaning of the concept of
uki and Voli 3
community (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2). Community in the
context of tourism planning and development is usually
defined from a geographical perspective as "a body of people
living in the same locality" (Wisansing, 2008). But we can-
not refer only to territory and geographic location when
describing community. Community encompasses "a particu-
lar local social system" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2) and "an
ideology, often hiding the power relations which inevitably
underlie communities" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 2). Urry
(1995) describes community existing when "there is `com-
munion,'" a particular kind of human association implying
personal ties, a sense of belonging and warmth" (p. 10). As
Murphy (1988) elegantly puts it:
Communities are groups of people residing in the same region
with common interests and identity and as such they represent a
bonding of people and place, which creates its own distinctive
character and force for survival in an increasingly impersonal
and big business world. (p. 96)
"Community" can embrace notions of spatial contiguity,
social interaction, reflexivity, notions of shared aspirations,
and values. It tends to be used implicitly in a consensual
sense, even when potential conflict and competition, particu-
larly in relation to the power relations involved in decision-
making processes, are the reality of place-based (and
non-place­based) social relations (Joppe, 1996; Pearce,
Moscardo, & Ross, 1996). "Communities" may not be geo-
graphically bounded or homogeneous entities, but can be
socially differentiated and diverse. Considerations of gender,
income, age, class/caste, origins, and other aspects of social
identity can be reflected in the holding of conflicting values
and resource priorities rather than the predominance of shared
interests and aspirations (Leach, Mearns, & Scoones, 1999).
We can say that today communities are key items when
we speak about tourism. There are host communities that are
"a basic reason for tourists to travel, to experience the way of
life and material products" (Richards & Hall, 2000, p. 1).
Community could be considered one of the central points of
a contemporary perspective on tourism and "the rights of
local communities must be integral to considerations of sus-
tainable development" (Howie, 2000).
In an effort to mitigate the tensions resulting from the
more negative impacts of uneven/unplanned development,
many researchers are suggesting that tourism-dominated/
interested communities should plan their evolution more sys-
tematically, thereby taking into account residents' attitudes
and perceptions about its growth at the outset (Beeton, 2006;
Haywood, 1988; Murphy, 1983, 1985; Okazaki, 2008; Reid,
Mair, & George, 2004; Richards & Hall, 2000; Simmons,
1994; Timothy, 1999). CBT is a
tourism that takes environmental, social and cultural
sustainability into account. It is managed and owned by the
community, for the community, with the purpose of enabling
visitors to increase their awareness and learn about the
community and local ways of life. (The Thailand Community
Based Institute, 2013)
Salazar emphasizes the importance of local initiatives that
should stipulate whether CBT becomes an acceptable model
for different stakeholders in particular local communities
(Salazar, 2012).
To establish a rational relationship between CBT and eco-
tourism, we must embrace an explanation of ecotourism as
"a sustainable form of natural resource-based tourism that
focuses primarily on experiencing and learning about nature
and which is ethically managed to be low-impact, non-con-
sumptive and locally oriented" (Fennel, 1999). UNEP and
the World Tourism Organization emphasized the characteris-
tics of ecotourism that are based on responsible project man-
agement. They include "an appreciation of indigenous
cultures prevailing in natural areas as part of the visitor expe-
rience, education and interpretation as part of the tourist
offerings, and the engagement of small visitor groups orga-
nized by small, specialized, and locally-owned businesses"
(World Wildlife Fund International, 2001). The terminology
of community-based ecotourism is relatively new, though the
concept has become familiar due to the theoretical develop-
ment of sustainable and CBT--it is the most responsible
tourism development for all the aspects of a community in
which it takes place--regarding at once nature, culture, and
socioeconomic status of a locale. As a concept, it "entails
people's commitment to responsibly use all available local
resources and to trigger development and prosperity through
local initiatives" (uki, Voli, Tisma, & Jelinci, 2014). If
we look more thoroughly, we can see that there is an overlap-
ping of CBT and ecotourism (low-impact, locally oriented,
presenting a local way of life). In addition, there are some
concepts that comprise ecotourism (indigenous cultures, nat-
ural areas, small visitor groups, specialized and locally
owned businesses) and that are easily adaptable to the con-
cept of CBT. For these reasons, we have chosen the term
community-based ecotourism as one of the theoretical back-
grounds for researching traditional wisdom and practices.
Tourism Policy and Planning With Special
Reference to CBT
Tourism policy and planning are two interconnected activi-
ties. Policy creation "is unique to each state and it should set
the regulations, rules, guidelines, directives and develop-
ment/promotion objectives, and strategies for long-term
tourism development" (Edgell, DelMastro Allen, Smith, &
Swanson, 2008, p. 32). Once policies are established, plans
are written to ensure that developments reflect overriding
policies (Sharpley & Telfer, 2008, p. 93). A more specific
definition linked to sustainability and planning is a "process
which aims to anticipate, regulate and monitor change to
4 SAGE Open
contribute to the wider sustainability of the destination, and
thereby enhance the tourist experience of the destination or
place" (Page & Connell, 2009, p. 477). Jamal and Getz claim
that "strategic planning of tourism destinations is a complex
task due to the interdependence of multiple stakeholders and
the fragmented control over a given destination's resources"
(Jamal & Getz, 1995). Usually, the governor's office and
administration, working together with the state legislature,
serve as the architects, budgeters, and planners for initiating,
implementing, and supporting a state's tourism program. But
there are many other stakeholders that are occasionally left
behind: "citizens, local governments, private businesses, and
economic, as well as environmental, social, and other groups
that should all be involved in the process" (Edgell et al.,
2008, p. 32). To achieve "continuous tourism planning that is
integrated with all other planning processes for social and
economic development, it must be modelled as an interactive
system" (Gunn, 1988).
Planning could occur at different scales--international,
national, regional, and community. All of them are important
for tourism, "but planning at the community level is vital if
any region wishes to deliver tourism experiences which
ensure both visitor satisfaction and ongoing benefits for the
residents of destination areas" (Simmons, 1994). There are
different aspects of tourism planning at the community level:
·
· the knowledge present within the community of their
own resources,
·
· an understanding of the nature of tourism and its
potential benefits/disadvantages,
·
· the participation of different stakeholders,
·
· environmental sensitivity,
·
· an awareness of power relations within the commu-
nity, and the potential economic and sociocultural
benefits.
In this article, we are prioritizing the first level of building
community capacity--knowledge about the resources and
the importance of traditional practices preservation and use
according to contemporary needs. After gaining knowledge
and an appreciation of the surroundings, the next logical step
should be the examining of information regarding the tourist
industry, along with all of its positive and negative aspects.
Where there is limited local knowledge of tourism, few, if
any, local leaders emerge, and external agents hold the bal-
ance of power over tourism development decisions. Under
these conditions, it is not surprising to find that tourism plan-
ning is not often conducted and that little effort is made to
coordinate the interests of local stakeholders (Moscardo,
2008, p. 10). On the contrary, planning the growth and devel-
opment of tourism where local participation is encouraged
by public agencies could lead to a conflict whereby a vocif-
erous minority influences decisions, while the silent majority
remains unheard, suggesting a passive but tacit acceptance
(Salazar, 2012).
One more very important thing is that
most of the planning literature dealing with tourism focuses on
what should be done in developing the industry at the expense of
providing an understanding of what is actually being pursued
and what can be done given a destination's local conditions.
(Timothy, 1999, p. 371)
As Moscardo (2008) explains, many existing tourism plan-
ning models are prescriptive and start with the assumption
that tourism should be developed. The option of not develop-
ing tourism is not considered and this omission is fundamen-
tally inconsistent with CBT (p. 6).
To avoid these potential conflicts, effective coordination
mechanisms and tourism plans should be created; otherwise,
it becomes increasingly difficult for destination communities
to get involved in either tourism development decisions or to
participate in tourism-related businesses. Moscardo argues
that more research and better information on different options
for involving communities in tourism through better coordi-
nation mechanisms, partnerships, and other cooperative ven-
tures would be useful in assisting communities in overcoming
these barriers (Moscardo, 2008, p. 10). In the process of
community tourism planning, the most important thing is to
start with the residents and their standpoints on tourism,
whether regarding their potential involvement or simply the
general development of tourism in their community. Our
impression is that before building capacities for tourism
development, community residents should be empowered
through knowledge about their own resources and through
the valuing of the residents themselves as an element of high
importance, which will in turn bring them closer to their
"true core values" (Anholt, 2010, p. 46).
Postsocial Transitional Society and
Tourism--Local Context
In this section, we examine the local context of the Balkans,
and more precisely North-Eastern Serbia, the Autonomous
Province of Vojvodina, the lower Danube basin, the
Municipality of Pancevo, the village Omoljica, and the
nature reserve Ponjavica. Serbian society could be described
as a "transitional society" that is faced with a change of
sociopolitical systems, while coming to terms with the con-
temporary global crisis of culture, economy, and ecological
disaster. This kind of situation effects the creation of new
development strategies. Together with an innovative cre-
ative economy and nature conservation, awareness about
cultural development is beginning to be raised. In defining
cultural development, endogenous development (based on
the internal resources of the specific country) and exoge-
nous development (induced or stimulated by external fac-
tors) refer to the processes of progress in all spheres of
human activity and life. Cultural development is thus con-
ceived as "a consequence of the mutual influence of
uki and Voli 5
different cultures, economic prosperity, technological
development, changes in the sociopolitical system, etc"
(Dragievi-Sesi & Stojkovi, 2011, p. 63).
An important aspect that must be mentioned when dis-
cussing traditional wisdom and life practices in the local con-
text mentioned above is that the practical public policy of the
former Yugoslavia was to impose a single model of social
behavior, much to the detriment of cultural diversity among
cities and villages (uki, 2012, pp. 207-228). Therefore,
traditional cultural forms, experiences, and values were at
times forgotten. Villages were overloaded with urban culture
and rural culture was moved to the city's museums, archives,
and libraries, all of which the rural population would barely
visit. In such a manner, the tangible and intangible cultural
heritage of a people is almost completely separated from that
same rural population whose generations were creating that
culture. However, the "cultural public" in contemporary
Serbia is not interested in the problems of the village, nor
does it recognize the diversity of cultural expressions and
identities of particular villages and towns (United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
[UNESCO], 2005), a wealth that should be saved from obliv-
ion, developed, promoted, and transmitted to future genera-
tions for its cultural value. On account of this neglect, there
has been a constant migration from villages to towns, so that
since the Second World War onwards, roughly 50% of the
rural population has left the villages; once home to 90% of
the population in the early fifties, the countryside now
accounts for about 40% of the total population of Serbia. In
such a situation, the local government and public cultural
institutions continue to perform their missions as in the time
of the dictatorial, centrist regime of the former Yugoslavia.
Currently, in the field of cultural policy, a concept of ter-
ritory driven cultural policy, which includes taking responsi-
bility for raising the quality of cultural life, is being developed
(Dragievi Sesi & Dragojevi, 2006). This kind of policy
implies turning to the internal resources of a very specific
location and cultural functionalism as a special model of cul-
tural policy action (Dragievi Sesi & Dragojevi, 2005, p.
21). It differs from cultural diffusionism in its inventiveness,
dynamism, dispersion, and involving of various local actors
who operate within public, private, and civil sectors. Focused
on the cultural life of local communities, not the elite culture
as the dominant model, it affirms different cultural models
that correspond to the diverse cultural needs of citizens.
Worthy of mention, the tourism-developed Western coun-
tries turning to local resources was a key issue during the 80s
of 20th century. In that time, Murphy (1988) explains that the
rise in community consciousness has been a growing awareness
of local heritage, both natural and cultural, which has created the
local way of life; such awareness has provided local roots to the
conservation movement and broadened its perspective from
concern over international landmarks, to more local issues, like
saving the downtown facades or local vistas.
In the same period Yugoslavia was a country with devel-
oped tourism (with tourism development based on Jafari's
"advocacy platform") with a tendency to develop more and
more tourist destinations (Baki, 1988). In the 90s, a civil
war occurred, leaving tourist actual and potential destina-
tions without any possibility for development. During the
first and second decades of the 21st century, some touristic
activities began to develop. Major planning documents had
been created (National tourism strategy of the Republic of
Serbia, and several destination master plans), and a high per-
centage of major public investments were directed toward
tourism development. In light of this context, we can regard
present-day Serbia as a country with underdeveloped tour-
ism that is planning for tourism to serve as one of its key
strategic economic activities. Despite these complications,
territorially driven cultural policy, as well as more jurisdic-
tion for local communities (municipalities), is opening up
possibilities for community-based activities, especially CBT
planning.
Research Method and Techniques
The article used the historical method to study and determine
the facts, analysis, and synthesis of the vertical development
of rural communities in whose territory is placed the pro-
tected natural park and its associated cultural heritage. Based
on studies of relevant theories and data on community-based
ecotourism and tourism planning gathered during theoretical
and empirical desk research, three methods of qualitative
analysis were used in this article--participant observation,
content analysis, and case study with narrative inquiry.
Observation is used as a qualitative field research, note-
taking method aimed at collecting data about the current
state of nature and culture in a specific rural community
placed in south-east of the Vojvodina province. The observa-
tion was carried out continuously in the period from 2012 to
2015 in the rural hinterland territory of the City of Pancevo,
which stands as the largest industrial and cultural center in
the region. The aim was to observe the extent to which natu-
ral and cultural heritage reflect the traditional wisdom of the
rural population, and to what extent is this heritage still intact
and usable in the everyday life of the community.
Content analysis is focused on documents related to pro-
tection and management of natural and cultural heritage,
with the purpose of studying the extent to which cultural,
tourism, educational, and other public policies encourage
development of CBT.
Finally, the case study was related to the area of both the
Ponjavica Nature Park and the Village of Omoljica, where
particular life practices and cultural heritage were analyzed
as traditional wisdom that could be a starting point for inter-
pretation through CBT. The first reason why this particular
location was chosen for in-depth research is that this Park is
one of 16 protected parks in Serbia, yet it remains virtually
unknown as a tourist destination, despite possessing
6 SAGE Open
considerable development resources. Another reason is that
we wanted to explore the extent of the development of the
awareness of the local people regarding the value of resources
embodying traditional wisdom. Methods used include narra-
tive inquiry and a number of interviews with representatives
of the local government, cultural institutions, civil organiza-
tions, and residents, all of which were conducted during the
period of observation, assuming that community-based eco-
tourism, as a form of alternative tourism, must embrace indi-
vidual initiatives within the community.
Results
Ponjavica Nature Park is located in the villages Omoljica and
Banatski Brestovac, which fall within the territorial jurisdic-
tion of town Pancevo, in the Vojvodina province of the
Republic of Serbia. In the document titled Proposal for the
Protection of the Ponjavica Nature Park, the Park is charac-
terized by
a variation of habitats in a natural and semi-natural condition
representing the last remains of the formerly large water and
swamp complex standing as part of the diluvial area of the
Danube river, as well as a refuge for many species whose
habitats were destroyed during water regulation. Ponjavica also
represents an ecological corridor connecting the torn remains of
the original, native vegetation along the flow of the Ponjavica
river with the ecological corridor of the Danube. (Provincial
Institute for Nature Protection, 2012)
Those characteristics mean that this park could be included
in the Ramsar "wetlands" (Stojanovi et al., 2011, p. 20), 10
of which exist in Serbia. From the standpoint of legislation in
the field of nature conservation in Serbia, Ponjavica was rec-
ognized in the aforementioned proposal as a protected area
with local significance, which until recently did not have an
international dimension (uki et al., 2014).
In accordance with the aim of this article, which addresses
and prioritizes the traditional wisdom of rural communities
and relies on community-based ecotourism and tourism
planning theories, we must examine the most significant
issues facing this geographical region. More precisely, it is a
village of Omoljica, founded in the 18th century. Today, it
has 6,518 inhabitants, the majority of whom are Serbs,
though in the past, there also lived Germans and Hungarians.
The village was founded in the 18th century, which is a
starting point for studying its development. Although this is
a rural area, its uniqueness lies in progressive development
and innovations, with special reference to local needs and the
surrounding nature. As a result of our previous research, we
have established that the territory of Omoljica village has
access to several cultural and historical elements which exist
and yet were not recognized in the Proposal for Protection.
Thus, their developmental role has not been considered so
far. Industrial­technical heritage that was identified as a part
of early industrialization is of great importance and could be
preserved and used as a valuable document of the past. For
the purpose of this article, we will mention the pump station
on the regional hydro system Nadela in Ivanovo, built in
1897. Regardless of the fact that it has been recommended
for conservation status as an example of industrial­technical
heritage worthy of preservation, it has not yet been included
in the conservation regime. Other example of industrial­
technical heritage are two machine mills dating from the
period between 1910 and 1930 that is considered as the
period of the greatest industrialization of the village. As
uki (2014) explained
they have been classified as entities of industrial-technical
heritage, representing a way of life and work of the village
population, which was primarily agricultural in the past, owing
to the exceptionally fertile soil of the diluvial area of the Danube.
(p. 54)
Along with the industrial-technical heritage, we should
mention a "miraculous" spring with healing water that was
used in the first half of the 20th century for treatment of dis-
eases. It could be considered as a part of traditional wisdom
that is fading since "numerous accounts regarding this cus-
tom and its associated beliefs failed to be recorded" (uki
et al., 2014). We strongly believe this is the time when proj-
ects of documenting customs and beliefs should be con-
ducted to reestablish the connection between past and current
generations.
Traditional wisdom, considered it its wider sense, is not
connected only to the industrial-heritage and medical beliefs.
The religious tradition, myths, and customs are also incorpo-
rated in tradition that had an impact on life practices. Some
religious artifacts, monuments, and rituals are still a part of
today's life. In Omoljica, there is one of the oldest Orthodox
Christian churches in Vojvodina, built in 1780. The church
continues to maintain an active role among the Orthodox
population in the village, by holding the liturgies on the main
traditional celebrations (Christmas, Easter). The days of the
patron saint of the village are celebrated here each year. This
unique custom is called "slava," and it is included in the
UNESCO's list of the intangible cultural heritage of Serbia.
It is a "celebration closely associated with the social and eco-
nomic development of local communities" (uki, 2014),
and as such it has always gathered the vast number of village
inhabitants that paid respect to the patron saint that provided
a village prosperity and welfare.
In the Pancevo district, vineyards were planted as early as
1718, and in the Omoljica region, there were once 200 ha of
vineyards. Today, while there is no more wine production,
there is an old vineyard cottage from 1920 that was used for
occasional stays related to this sort of use of agricultural land
and vineyard maintenance. Near to the cottage is an old
grapevine sort known as Dinka, which was typical of
Vojvodina in these earlier times.

In addition to wine growing, the whole way of life of the
rural population in the past was directly linked to the differ-
ent ways of utilizing the extremely fertile Banat soil. Other
traditional life practices are visible in Omoljica--residential
houses and economic facilities made of earth (examples
range from a Neolithic age pit to late 18th century represen-
tations to the traditional earthen architecture), industrial­
technical facilities (which today represent the cultural
heritage--mills, pumping station, vineyard cottages, etc.),
the culture of work that is primarily based on agriculture
(cereals, wine, industrial crops such as sunflower), the indus-
trial processing of agricultural products in the food industry
(flour, sugar, oil, wine, brandy, etc.), and the culture of dress-
ing (silk that was created by the silkworms reared on mul-
berry trees), customs, beliefs, and other forms of intangible
culture.
Current Initiatives
Tourism planning in Serbia is conducted as a top-down activ-
ity, where the government controls the framework for policy
and industry development. The region of Southern Banat and
Omoljica village is still not being planned as a tourist desti-
nation, as other localities are seen as priorities for this pur-
pose. On the contrary, local civil initiatives have been starting
their bottom-up activities for the preservation and promotion
of natural and cultural assets. In the recent time, the Ponjavica
Association of Environmentalists has been established to
plan and conduct ecotourism in the protected area of
Omoljica. The Association has developed a long-term inte-
grated management project (2012-2017) which is aimed at
creating a consistent and coherent concept of viable commu-
nity-based ecotourism in Omoljica (uki et al., 2014). This
management project comprises three different, yet connected
groups of activities that comprehensively approach ecotour-
ism development. Those are "research of natural and cultural
potentials, interpretation of heritage, functioning as a prepa-
ration of the destination for potential visitors, and promotion,
aimed at attracting visitors" (uki et al., 2014). The first
group of activities, research, was aimed at bringing out the
stories and narratives of the locals (intangible heritage), as a
development potential of the Omoljica village. Results that
came out of the research served as a platform for selection
and prioritizing the stories and narratives that can serve as a
base for CBT product creation. Those were promoted and
published on the website of the Association, in the form of
short stories with a goal of awareness raising of the local
population regarding its natural and cultural values, while, at
the same time, redefining the identity of the protected area,
creating a recognizable spirit of the place that could attract
local visitors (uki et al., 2014). The stories are structured
in such a way that each represents a particular topic from the
village life (barn, cinema, water, mulberry tree, Zisel, soil,
mill, Nadela, etc.), reconstructed from written sources or
from the memories of the local population. In addition to
being adaptable for guided tours, the stories and project aims
to motivate the local population to participate in the develop-
ment of ecotourism in the area of their village. This is par-
ticularly significant, "since the village school and library
have not been designed particularly as institutions of local
memory" (uki, 2014, p. 77), due to which locals are not
well-acquainted with their past, lacking an awareness of the
natural and cultural values of the village and its potential
attractiveness for domestic and international visitors. The
project has been continued through the creation of tourist
routes that include the most significant natural and cultural
localities in Omoljica village. They currently exist only as an
online map, with possibilities for walking, bicycle, and canoe
tours organizing.
Efforts of the Association are devoted to the tourist acti-
vation of Omoljica and Ponjavica, based on existing
resources. Thus far, the association's activities have been
manifested in efforts to set up a website intended for the local
population and visitors and to organize gastronomic and
sports-recreation events (the making of mulberry brandy in
the traditional manner, a photo safari by canoe, a contest in
the fish pot specialty making that is a part of the traditional
celebration of the village slava--Preobrazenje). In the period
to follow, the Association is planning to finish the restoration
of the vineyard cottage, which would increase lodging
capacities for visitors. The main problem that remains for all
of the activities--realized, as well as planned, is unsustain-
able funding. From the Association's cash flow analysis, we
can see that "all the funds invested to this point have been
acquired from sponsors and individual donations of the
Association founders" (uki et al., 2014). Because many
activities are still at a start-up level and they tend to activate
members of the local community, we argue there should be
more sources of funding, with additional financial help from
the municipality of Pancevo. The funding diversity would
unburden the individuals and assist accelerating sustainable
ecotourism product creation.
As a part of current initiatives, but dating back to 1970, we
can mention the "Zisel international film festival." It was
established on the presumption that "indigenous cultures pre-
vailing in natural areas are the basic characteristics of eco-
tourism" (uki et al., 2014), and since the establishment, it
has contributed to the international activity of Omoljica vil-
lage and its surrounding protected area. This manifestation
bears witness to the unique cultural relationship between the
inhabitants of Omoljica and their natural environment, dem-
onstrating the synergy of nature and culture using arts as its
means. At the same time, "it contributes towards establishing
and broadening the international perception of Omoljica from
the standpoint of filmmakers worldwide, who participate in
the competition of this festival with their films" (uki et al.,
2014). However, the local community still does not relate to
this event as a potential for tourism development. Since its
foundation in 1970, "Zisel has not been supported by the
town's tourist or cultural policy; it has neither stable sources
8 SAGE Open
of financing, nor promotional channels" (uki-Dojcinovi,
1992, pp. 193-194). The specificity of this festival is that it
was the only film village festival in the entire former
Yugoslavia and as such it attracted thousands of visitors and
tourists back then. In recent years, "it has been of interest pri-
marily only to filmmakers, whose films have been entered in
the competition, as well as only minor elements of the local
population" (uki et al., 2014). This situation caused an
activist reaction of a group of young inhabitants of Omoljica
which started the initiative for the International Volunteer Camp
Sunflower to be held immediately before the start of the festival,
so that local and international volunteers could have time to help
in the organization of the festival Zisel, as well as in its promotion
and cultural program. (uki et al., 2014, p. 76)
This activism reflects the core of the community-based eco-
tourism that should be initiated and developed by members of
the local community. Current initiatives of mostly young
people represent an affirmative circumstance. With more sta-
ble projects funding and more visitors coming to the munici-
pality, it could be a certain path to CBT development.
Discussion
Regarding the results of the desk and field research, some
insights have been made that could be useful to the further
development of community-based ecotourism that would
include and prioritize the traditional wisdom of the Omoljica
rural community.
First of all, it is a fact that tourism development, planned
as a top-down activity, leaves out small communities that
have some resources, yet not enough motivation to carry
out development activities. In the case of Nature Park
Ponjavica,
it is obvious that different levels of territorial jurisdiction are
present--on the one hand, there are state and provincial activities
reflected in legislative regulation and occasional funding and,
on the other hand, there are efforts of individual and small group
initiatives in the local community with a number of activities
financed by their personal means. (uki et al., 2014, p. 60)
The Municipality of Pancevo as local government does not
represent a significant role in the protection, management,
and funding. As a key stakeholder that is in charge of devel-
opment and funding issues, Municipality should position
itself as an active player in development of strategic activi-
ties and it should collaborate with the "Tamis Dunav" public
utility company that serves as a caretaker in charge of man-
aging the Ponjavica Nature Park. Currently, this company
lacks the planning processes and motivation that could define
priorities and measurable aims for future development, based on
which destination management, products, services, and
marketing could be developed to bring about positive economic,
social, cultural, and environmental impacts, as well as stimulate
offerings to visitors. (uki et al., 2014)
As opposed to the lack of activities on the side of the gov-
ernment and public institutions, private and civil sectors are
active in the fields of research, interpretation, and promotion
of the tourism resources. The existence of such initiatives is
important because they represent the actual strength, willing-
ness, and capacity of individuals associated in small groups
with the aim of encouraging CBT development. Yet, as we
have already concluded, most of these efforts are "short-
term" and ad hoc in nature, while there is only one legitimate
bottom-up integration management project, conducted by the
recentlyfoundedPonjavicaAssociationofEnvironmentalists"
(uki et al., 2014). In the longer run, individual civil and
private initiatives could not be sustainable without develop-
mental framework provided by the local government. Tourism
policy and planning should have a key role for such a frame-
work, assuming they are created with the respect to natural
and cultural resources and current individual initiatives.
Second, we would like to emphasize the importance of
documenting the village's past, the lack of which has caused
a discontinuity of remembrance. This means that the people
living nowadays in the village are not appropriately aware of
the local history and tradition, due to the aforementioned
Yugoslav practical cultural policy that segregated rural cul-
ture from the rural citizens, placing the artifacts of rural cul-
ture in museums located in cities and towns. This tendency,
which lasted over 50 years, has left its traces that are visible
in the cultural oblivion and identity loss of the rural popula-
tion. The only initiatives that are happening in Omoljica and
Ponjavica are the ones coming from individuals and private
civil associations. They are active in the field of investigat-
ing, research, and documenting cultural and natural assets.
They have, as a matter of necessity, taken over activities that
public institutions should be in charge of; the activities that
are of public importance. The initiative of the civil sector is
valuable, but it cannot handle nor replace the systematic and
coordinated work of public institutions in charge of docu-
menting and protecting cultural heritage. However, their ini-
tiative could serve as an impetus and starting point from
which the activities of the public institutions could expand.
Third, it is easily apparent that elements of the cultural tan-
gible heritage whose traces are documented remain visible in
the territory of the village (hydro system, mills, brickworks,
pumping station, vineyard cottage), while the intangible heri-
tage has begun to be illustrated in the stories of the inhabitants
and "slava"--the celebration of family saint patron's day as
an active traditional living practice, one which was inscribed
in November 2014 onto the UNESCO Representative List of
the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Humanity upon a pro-
posal from Serbia. All of these elements, together with the
natural surroundings, could serve as a resource base for tour-
ism planning. One positive circumstance is visible in the
expanding jurisdiction of the municipality for activities
uki and Voli 9
related to tourism. The key approaching challenge would be
how to systematically maintain and preserve current resources
while preparing local inhabitants and the municipality for
tourism development.Another significant challenge would be
the documenting and gathering of data needed for protected
area ecotourism planning.
In achieving these goals, educational and cultural heritage
institutions have a particularly significant role, but thus far
they have not shown appropriate levels of the awareness of
the value of rural cultural heritage, or its role in its safeguard-
ing, conveyance, and usage. Traditional forms of knowledge
and organization, which have contributed to sustainable
development in the past, can be learnt from and built upon
(Leach, 1998) through educational and cultural programs and
projects aimed at safeguarding, transferring, and promoting
traditional practices, representations, expressions, knowl-
edge, and skills--as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts,
and cultural spaces associated there with (according to the
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage,
UNESCO, 2003). On the contrary, in rural communities, in
which these two types of institutions are organizationally
separate, schools and libraries represent a complementary
institutional framework of potential partnership for sustain-
able development and planning of CBT. Their role is espe-
cially important because the CBT theory indicates that before
building capacities for tourism development, community
residents should be more informed and empowered through
knowledge about their own resources. Otherwise, it becomes
increasingly difficult for destination communities to get
involved in either tourism development decisions or to par-
ticipate in tourism-related businesses.
Conclusion
Based on the theoretical background and research, the key
issues related to documenting and including traditional wis-
dom in community-based ecotourism planning in Nature
Park Ponjavica are
·
· a discontinuity in traditional wisdom remembrance,
resulting in cultural oblivion,
·
· a lack of knowledge among the locals about the
resources in their community,
·
· the non-existence of plans for tourism development,
and
·
· a lack of interest from the administrative center (city
of Pancevo) regarding Omoljica and Ponjavica.
Traditional forms of knowledge and organization, which
have contributed to sustainable development in the past, can
be learnt from and built upon through educational and cul-
tural programs and projects aimed to safeguard, transfer, and
promote traditional wisdom--practices, representations and
expressions, knowledge, and skills--as well as the associated
instruments, objects, artifacts, and cultural spaces associated.
Relying on the CBT theory, research, and current insights
of the Omoljica and Ponjavica community, there are some
steps that would seem to be rational when approaching com-
munity-based ecotourism in this locale. First of all, awareness
raising and education about the local resources is the starting
point in reconnecting locals with their heritage. Traditional
forms of knowledge and organization, which have contrib-
uted to the sustainable use of local resources in the past,
should be learnt from and built upon through educational and
cultural programs and projects aimed to safeguard, transfer,
and promote traditional practices and wisdom. By raising
awareness, local inhabitants would gain a new perspective in
valuing their natural and cultural assets. After gaining new
perspectives about the values of their community, local inhab-
itants should be well informed and educated about tourism as
a possible economic activity. In addition, they should decide
whether they indeed want tourism to be developed in their
municipality. In obtaining this statement from local commu-
nity, we can be sure to avoid a prescriptive standpoint toward
local tourism development. If a positive approach toward
tourism has been established, the next step would be educa-
tion of community members and their subsequent inclusion in
the ecotourism development. By gradually developing tour-
ism, conflict can be prevented, which can occur when locals
do not feel the benefits of such development. Activities
involving the local community should include specific plan-
ning for tourism and should enhance the destination commu-
nity's abilities not only to implement the tourism plans but
also to retain control over the plans themselves. Parallel to the
processes of local community education and awareness rais-
ing, an infrastructure for the documentation and presentation
of traditional wisdom and heritage should be established.
Because the libraries in Serbia have been programmed as
"memory institutions," the establishment of a rural native
fund, or local history collection, could be the new system
solution for cultural policy based on the documentation of tra-
ditional preindustrialization wisdom. This would be a first
step toward the physical availability of rural heritage to the
local population and to visitors as well. The second step could
be horizontal multifunctional strategic partnerships among
schools, community centers, and other stakeholders in the
countryside and the city. These efforts would address the
diversification of cultural and educational programs to inter-
pret the value and importance of heritage to modern society
and thus render it emotionally and intellectually accessible to
different social groups in the towns and villages in Serbia. An
interpretation, as an integral part of the process of creating
narratives, could include educational programs for the devel-
opment of skills and abilities to create programs and projects
inspired by local heritages. In this way, the actors in the pub-
lic, private, and civil society sector could create geographical
and functional clusters, transferring competences, skills,
experience, contacts, and resources to each other. Finally, the
third step, which would encompass public activities and
their associated promotion, could encourage local people to
10 SAGE Open
participate in the creation of native funds through gifts and
legacies, as well as to engage in the use of collected materials
about the origin and development of the village. This would
increase the number of users of library services (or "native
fund" services), and allow these users to gain knowledge
about the history, economy, and culture of the total territory of
the municipality (both city as a centre and surrounding vil-
lages). These activities could develop an awareness that the
village as well as the city is contributing to the sustainable
development of the region.
These steps seem rational and easy to implement. Thus,
we have no negative presumptions on how it would reflect
on the particular local community of Omoljica. Theories of
territorially driven cultural policy and CBT are a good start-
ing point for the local community because the valuing of
local resources could bring people closer to their "true core
values." It is, however, possible that these "core values"
could turn out to be something other than expected, or not
taken into account, and that other elements could appear.
Either way, an effort starting with small steps should be initi-
ated, which could begin with gathering the local community
together so that they can begin to reflect on their surround-
ings, material and immaterial. Identifying and dealing with
what is at the community's disposal would be a starting point
for the mapping and evaluation of resources, seen and felt by
the locals themselves.
