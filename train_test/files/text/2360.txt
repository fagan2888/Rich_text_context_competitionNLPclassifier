Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of
body mass index (BMI) at earlier ages on risk of overweight/obesity at age
of 11 years.
Study Design: This is a longitudinal study of 907 children from birth to
age of 11 years. Predictors include BMI at earlier ages and outcome is
overweight/obesity status at age of 11 years. Analyses were adjusted for
covariates known to affect BMI.
Result: At 11 years, 17% were overweight and 25% were obese. Children
whose BMI was measured asX85th percentile once at preschool age had a
twofold risk for overweight/obesity at 11 years of age. Risk increased by 11-
fold if a child's BMI measured was noted more than once during this age.
During early elementary years, if a child's BMI was>85th percentile once,
risk for overweight/obesity at 11 years was fivefold and increased by
72-fold if noted more than two times. During late elementary years, if a
child's BMI was>85th percentile once, risk for overweight/obesity was
26-fold and increased by 351-fold if noted more than two times. Risk of
overweight/obesity at 11 years was noted with higher maternal prepregnancy
weight, higher birth weight, female gender and increased television viewing.
Conclusion: Children in higher BMI categories at young ages have a
higher risk of overweight/obesity at 11 years of age. Effect size was greater
for measurements taken closer to 11 years of age. Pediatricians need to
identify children at-risk for adolescent obesity and initiate counseling and
intervention at earlier ages.

Introduction
Obesity is recognized as a major cause of health problems in
childhood.1 Obesity persists from childhood to adolescence and into
adulthood.2,3 Among children in the United States, the prevalence
of obesity has increased from approximately 5% in 1963 to 1972 to
17% in 2003 to 2004.4
The health risk of overweight and obesity status in childhood is
that the body mass index (BMI) predicts cardiovascular changes in
adulthood,1,5,6 early onset of Type II diabetes,7,8 asthma,9
obstructive sleep apnea8 and psychological distress.10­12
Recommendations for the assessment, prevention and treatment of
child and adolescent overweight and obesity status have recently
been reviewed.1,13,14,15 It is imperative, therefore that obesity be
recognized as early as possible in childhood. However,
perinatologists and neonatologists are also interested in obesity
because there is an emerging hypothesis that obesity may be due to
maternal and fetal (developmental) nutrition, developmental
exposure to environmental chemicals or the interaction of
nutrition and environmental exposures during development.16,17
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development demonstrated that
children with a BMI of>85th percentile as well as a BMI in the high-
reference ranges are more likely than children with a BMI <50th
percentile to continue to gain weight and reach overweight status by
adolescence.18 The sample studied was drawn from middle class
families that were predominantly White. The objective of our study was
to estimate the predictive value of earlier levels of BMI on later risk of
overweight status (Xthe 85th percentile) and obesity (Xthe 95th
percentile) during early adolescence in an urban, low socioeconomic
status sample while controlling for variables that effect obesity and
overweight status. The multi-site longitudinal study evaluating the
effect of maternal lifestyle during pregnancy on childhood and
adolescent outcome (Maternal Lifestyle Study) offered an opportunity
to study risk for obesity in early childhood in this at-risk population.

Methods
The Maternal Lifestyle Study is performed at four sites
(Brown University, University of Miami, University of Tennessee at
Memphis and Wayne State University) in The Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Neonatal Research Network with additional support from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at each of the participating clinical
centers and informed consent was obtained before study initiation.
The recruitment and selection procedures have been described
previously.19 The children were born between May of 1993 and May
of 1995. The study groups consisted of 658 cocaine-exposed infants
(diagnosed by maternal self-report and meconium analysis of
cocaine metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy)
and 730 comparison group infants matched on race, gender and
gestational age. Confidentiality regarding maternal substance use
was assured through each center's National Institute on Drug
Abuse Certificate of Confidentiality. Children were evaluated on an
annual basis from birth to the 11 year visit (to 2006). At each
clinic visit, height was measured with the child standing without
shoes, feet together on a stadiometer. Weight was measured using a
2-Beam scale with children wearing light clothing (no shoes, no
outer clothing and no items that could add weight such as keys,
belts or watches). The BMI was determined separately for boys and
girls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
National Center for Health Statistics Growth charts designed for use
for children from 2 to 20 years of age.20
Statistical analyses
Children who were present for the 11 year visit and had at least two
previous visits at ages 1 through 11 years were included in the
study. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk for
overweight and obesity at 11 years were examined comparing the
frequency with which children did reach versus did not reach
specific BMI percentiles during the preschool year (2 to 4 years),
early elementary (5 to 7 years) and late elementary (8 to 10 years)
visit to the clinic. Logistic regression analysis controlled for
predefined perinatal, childhood and sociodemographic variables
known to affect BMI. The maternal variables included maternal
substance use, prepregnancy height and weight and race.4,21,22 The
infant variables included birth weight and gender.22 From the age
of 6 years, information on physical activity, including hours of
exercise, days of exercise in the past week and sport activities from
the child and parental interview were obtained using the Child
Health and Illness Profile. Information on the hours of watching
television (reflecting physical inactivity) was also obtained from the
interview of the child at 11 years. Information on diet was obtained
from a 3-day food diary using the Nutri-Pro Data System. The
sociodemographic variables included assessment of socioeconomic
status, education, annual income, occupation and whether the
family was living at the Federal Poverty Level.23,24 Only perinatal
and neonatal variables were used at birth, whereas variables
evaluating physical activity, inactivity, blood pressure and diet were
examined at the annual visits between 6 and 11 years of age.
Family history and parental blood pressure was available only at
the 11 year visit.
Two sets of logistic regression models were conducted. The first set
of models predicted whether children were overweight or obese at 11
years of age, based on whether they were 85th to 95th percentile
or>95th percentile for weight at earlier ages. Models were developed
separately for boys and girls. The second set of models predicted
overweight or obese at 11 years, based on BMI at earlier ages. These
analyses were conducted for the combined sample. The analyses
accounted for clustering of children at the site level using the SUDAAN
software (Research Triangle Institute 2008, Research Triangle Park,
NC, USA) for cluster-correlated data.
Results
The study sample included 907 children seen at the 11 year visit.
Approximately, 42% of the children were overweight or obese, 17%
of the entire group was overweight and 25% were obese (Table 1).
The clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 2.

At 11 years, the mean±s.d. for weight for the boys was 44±13 kg,
whereas that of the girls was 48±16 kg. The mean height for the
boys was 145±7 cm, whereas that of the girls was 148±8 cm.
The BMI for the boys was 21±5, whereas that of the girls was
22±6. Approximately, 14% of the boys were overweight and 24%
were obese at 11 years of age. Among the girls, 20% were
overweight and 26% were obese.
The logistic regression model predicting BMI greater than 85th
percentile based on prenatal, neonatal, 7 and 11 year factors is
shown in Table 2. Higher maternal prepregnancy weight, higher
birth weight and watching 3 h or more of television at 7 years of
age was associated with a higher risk of BMI>85th percentile at
11 years of age, whereas male gender and less than a high school
maternal education were associated with a lower odds of being
overweight or obese at 11 years of age.
The risk of being overweight or obese at 11 years of age, given
the number of times the BMI exceeded the 85th percentile or 50th
percentile during the preschool, early elementary or late
elementary years is shown in Table 3, following adjustment for
maternal, neonatal and childhood variables listed in the Table.
Children who wereX85th percentile at one time between 2 to 4
years of age had twice the risk for overweight status at 11 years.

If BMI was measured atX85th percentile for more than two times
during this age, the risk increased 11 times. Between 5 and 7 years
of age, if BMIX85th percentile was noted once, the risk for
becomingX85th percentile at 11 years was fivefold. The risk
increased by 72-fold if BMI was measuredX85th percentile for
more than two times. Between 8 and 10 years of age, if BMIX85th
percentile occurred once, the risk for overweight status at 11 years
was increased by 26-fold. The risk increased by 352-fold if BMI was
measuredX85th percentile for more than two times. After
controlling for covariates, being overweight at previous visits was
associated with increased odds of being overweight at 11 years.
Overweight status at 2 years was associated with odds ratio 4.5
(1.7 to 11.8) for overweight status at 11 years. Overweight status at
6, 8 and 10 years was associated with odds ratio of 26.8 (14.2 to
50.3), 86.7 (40.9 to 183.7) and 239.2 (12.1 to 560.5), respectively,
of becoming overweight at 11 years.
The relationship between being overweight or obese at 11 years
of age and BMI at earlier ages is demonstrated in Figure 1. For
each age, children were divided into 20 groups, based on their BMI
percentiles. The sample sizes across the categories ranged from a
low of 3% to a high of 20% of the sample. Logistic regression
models were computed to predict the probability of being overweight or
obese at 11 years of age for each of the 20 groups at earlier ages. As
noted in the figure, children in the higher BMI categories at younger
ages had consistently higher probability of being overweight or obese at
11 years of age. This relationship is strongest for the later ages as
illustrated by the steepness of the curves.
Discussion
In this longitudinal secondary analysis of preexisting data
involving 907 at-risk children aged 11 years we found an
alarmingly high rate (42%) of overweight and obesity. The effect
size was greater for BMI measurements taken closer to 11 years.
This effect persisted after controlling for perinatal, childhood and
sociodemographic variables that contribute to the risk of obesity
and overweight status.
In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study,
among 6- to 11-year-old children, the prevalence of obesity was
18.5%.4 In our study we found that 25% of our 11-year-old children
were obese. This high rate may reflect the predominately inner city,
low socioeconomic status of the children in our study.23,24 Our
finding that higher BMI was associated with a higher maternal
weight before pregnancy, higher birth weight, female gender and
more hours of watching television have been documented by other
investigators.1,22,25 In our study we found there was a trend that
participation in physical activity could be protective against overweight
status (P¼ 0.09), a finding noted by other investigators.1 We did find
a relationship between low maternal education and low child BMI.
Recently, van Rossem et al.26 evaluated 2954 Dutch children and
found that relative to children from mothers with the highest
educational level, mean BMI s.d. scores was lower at 2 years in
children with low, mid-low and mid-high educational level, and in the
mid-low group at 3 years. They conclude that the inverse relationship
between socioeconomic status and childhood overweight presumably
emerges after age 3 years.
We evaluated the affect of prenatal substance abuse on the
child's BMI at 11 years of age and did not find any relationship.
Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with a negative affect on
height, weight and head circumference, whereas cocaine exposure has
been associated with impaired growth in childhood.27,28,29 Smoking
during pregnancy has been associated with an increase BMI during
early childhood as well as adolescence.30,31
The findings of our study parallel those that of the Early
Childcare and Youth Development longitudinal study in which it is
was shown that children with a BMI>85th percentile are more
likely than children whose BMI <50th percentile to continue to
gain weight and reach overweight status by adolescence.18 However,
our study specifically focuses on high-risk urban, low
socioeconomic status children, including those whose mothers had
used cocaine, alcohol and tobacco during the pregnancy. Another
difference between our study and the Early Childcare Youth
Development Study is that our study included preterm infants and
our study measured growth at more time points. Lastly, in our
study we evaluated the affect of variables known to influence BMI
including maternal, child and sociodemographic variables.
The strengths of our study include the large number of children
who were evaluated, the prospective nature of the evaluation and
the assessment of confounding variables that effect BMI. The
drawback of the study is that we did not have assessments of skin
fold thickness, measurements of the waist-to-hip ratio or the waist-
to-height ratio at 11 years of age.32,33
The clinical implication of this study is that overweight and
obesity in adolescence is preceded by increasing BMI in the
preschool years. We emphasize that obesity in children is a huge
problem. An increase in the percentage of overweight status among

non-Hispanic Black adolescents has been noted by other
investigators.4 Our findings address this high-risk group because
our study population included a high percentage of Black children.
Parents and pediatricians need to recognize the early onset of
childhood obesity, and efforts to reduce overweight status needs to
be initiated in the preschool period. It is possible to prevent as well
as treat obesity.1 Our study highlights this association by
demonstrating a trend for increased physical activity to be
protective, whereas sedentary habits such as television watching
increased the risk of obesity. The perinatal period and the period of
adiposity rebound 16,17 have been identified as critical periods that
effect weight gain for pediatric patients: in our study we have
identified the preschool years also as a time when rapid weight
gain can affect adolescent obesity.
