How do Civic Associations Foster Political
Participation? The Role of Scope and
Intensity of Organizational Involvement
DOI 10.1515/npf-2016-0010
Abstract: This paper investigates factors associated with individuals' decisions
in engaging in various modes of political participation, including voting, formal
and informal political activities. Two aspects of civic association involvement
are highlighted: scope and intensity. Using data from the U.S. Citizenship,
Involvement, and Democracy Survey in 2006, we find that one's memberships
in civic associations only explain one's participation in formal political activ-
ities, but the intensity of involvement, measured by the number of activities one
performs at one's most active voluntary association, is positively associated with
both formal and informal participation modes. Neither the scope nor the inten-
sity explains voting behavior. The study suggests ways to promote the develop-
ment of civic associations and enhance democracy.
Keywords: political participation, civic associations
1 Introduction
Political participation is vital to democracy (Tocqueville 2002; Fung 2003; Verba
and Nie 1972; Verba, Schlozman, Brady 1995). Why people participate in political
life has thus been an important research question for generations of scholars.
Starting with the seminal works of Downs (1957) and Olson (1965), many scho-
lars have examined the causes of political participation. Downs (1957) adopts an
economic perspective, arguing that it is irrational to vote if the probability that a
single vote will make a difference to the outcome of the election is minuscule.
Building upon Downs' argument, Olson (1965) proposes that rational individuals

will not contribute time, money, or effort to public goods unless selective
incentives are provided. These ideas help establish a general framework for
the rational choice theory.
Following the rational choice theory, scholars have tried to empirically
examine the effects of various factors on political participation. They first
focus on the personal-level indicators, such as income, education, psychological
involvement, political efficacy, or party identification. The standard socioeco-
nomic model, or the resource model, developed by Verba and colleagues (e. g.,
Brady, Schlozman, and Verba 1999; Brady, Verba, and Schlozman 1995; Verba
et al. 1993; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995), is the most influential one.
It proposes that participation is primarily driven by individuals' resources
(i. e., time, money). High-status individuals are more likely to participate in
politics than low-status individuals (Milbrath 1965; Verba, Schlozman, and
Brady 1995). A second group of scholars focuses on the mobilization effect. It
asserts that participation is a response to contextual cues structured by the
individual's environment. Individuals participate in politics because they are
asked (through either institutional or informal channels) to do so (Kitts 2000;
Lim 2008). These two mechanisms are succinctly summarized in Brady, Verba,
and Schlozman (1995), in which they state that "they can't, they don't want to,"
or "nobody asked" can best explain the puzzle for political participation.
Another stream of research emphasizes the importance of "organizational
life." Scholars assert that civic associations are the training ground where citizens
learn meaningful democratic skills and foster civic virtues and collective efficacy
(Andrews et al. 2010; Berry, Portney, and Thomson 1993; Tocqueville 2002;
Putnam 2000; Schachter 2011; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). A number of
scholars have empirically tested the effects of civic associations on political
participation. Some focus on association memberships, arguing that the more
one is affiliated with civic associations, the more one is involved in political
activities (Lim 2008; Quintelier 2008; Wollebæk and Strømsnes 2007). Other
scholars "get into the organization" and focus on the activities one performs in
civic associations. They propose that the extent to which one is active in associa-
tional activities is more important than memberships in political participation
(Alexander et al. 2010; Sobieraj and White 2004). Somma (2010), for example,
finds that protest participation is positively associated with one's commitment of
time and money to civic organizations. Therefore, both membership and degree of
involvement seem important, but which one matters more is inconclusive.
To summarize, one's organizational life, along with one's socioeconomic
characteristics and network mobilization, are critical to political participation.
They have been studied by scholars from different disciplines. In addition, most
research treats political action as a single-dimension variable measured by
4 H. Li and J. Zhang
voting behavior or the number of political activities in which individuals engage.
However, political participation is not simply equated with voter turnout, nor is
it the simple aggregation of different activities. Rather, it is a multidimensional
concept that includes different forms of political action, such as formal or
informal participation (Newman and Bartels 2010).
This study contributes to the literature by distinguishing various modes of
political participation and by specifying the mechanisms under which civic
associations influence political participation. Specifically, we categorize political
participation into three modes: voting, formal, and informal participation. We
propose that these modes vary in their degree of institutionalization, the number
of people involved, the difficulty of acts, and the degree of policy influence. In
addition, we identify two aspects of associational life ­ the scope and the
intensity ­ and find that they relate to the various modes of political participa-
tion differently. The study proceeds this way. First, we review various streams of
literature and explain how civic associations are related to different modes of
political participation. Second, we use the data from the U.S. Citizenship,
Involvement, and Democracy Survey in 2006 to test a set of hypotheses.
Following that, findings are presented. We conclude the paper by summarizing
the main findings and the implications of the research.
2 Theory and Hypotheses
Political participation is defined as "those actions of private citizens by which
they seek to influence or to support government and politics" (Milbrath 1981,
198). Civic associations are organized and governed by private individuals in
their capacities as citizens who are concerned with public matters (Andrews
et al. 2010; Salamon and Anheier 1992). They depend on members' voluntary
efforts for management and operation. They often have a decentralized decision
making process during which members' collective voices can be heard. The
relationship between civic associations and political participation has long
been studied. In this paper, we first distinguish three types of political participa-
tion: voting, formal, and informal participation. How civic associations are
related to them is then presented.
2.1 Three Modes of Political Participation
Political participation not only includes voting but also encompasses various
forms of other political activities, such as volunteering for a political candidate

or campaign, contacting government officials, attending meetings of local gov-
ernment boards or councils, signing petitions, or engaging in protests or demon-
strations. These activities can be categorized into three types: voting, formal, and
informal participation. They differ in a variety of ways (See Table 1; Newman and
Bartels 2010; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). First, they vary in the degree
of institutionalization. Some political acts, such as voting, are highly institutio-
nalized; they operate within the well-established formal or legal channels. In
contrast, some political activities, such as informal, are loosely structured out-
side the formal institutional channels (McAdam 2010). Second, some participa-
tion forms are individualized, whereas others are group-based (Klandermans
2003; Pattie, Seyd, and Whiteley 2003). For example, voting is a highly indivi-
dualized political act, whereas formal and informal forms of participation may
be shaped by group interactions and social networks. Third, the three forms of
participation vary in terms of the "difficulty of the act" (Verba and Nie 1972),
with some requiring less time and effort to carry out and others more. For
example, voting requires less initiative, whereas formal or informal forms of
political acts, such as protesting or contacting officials, require more time,
money, and skills (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). In addition, the three
modes provide varying degree of information about citizens' preferences, inter-
ests, and needs, and they differ in their influence on public policy (Verba,
Schlozman, and Brady 1995; Walker 2008). Voting, for example, often conveys
ambiguous information about voters' preferences and provides an infrequent
and blunt instrument for political influence (Dalton 2008; Verba et al. 1993). In
other words, voting only occurs every several years, and waiting that long to
vote down the administration that one is dissatisfied with seems like political
inaction. Instead, some political acts, such as contacting government officials or
signing a petition, seem to be more direct means of expressing political concerns
and influencing policy makers (Dalton 2008; Norris 2002; Stolle, Hooghe, and
Micheletti 2005; Wuthnow 2002; Zukin et al. 2006).
Given the distinctions in the modes of political participation, it is likely that
factors associated with them vary. While existing research on political participa-
tion has mostly focused on individuals' socioeconomic status and network

relations, this study highlights the role of "organizational life" in political
participation. Below, we examine how civic associations influence political
participation. Specifically, we distinguish two aspects of civic participation,
scope and intensity, and relate them to different modes of political participation.
2.2 Civic Associations and Political Participation
Civic associations have long been considered critical to political participation.
More than a century ago, Tocqueville (2002) argued that civic associations do
not only empower individuals but also serve as a learning school for democracy.
Almond and Verba (1963) stressed on the importance of civic associations in
fostering a democratic political culture and in providing their members with an
increased sense of political efficacy. Civic associations may also function as
agents of mobilization through disseminating political information and encoura-
ging group discussions (Eliasoph 1998; Pollock 1982).
In examining the role of civic associations, most studies use the "member-
ship approach," which uses either binary variables to indicate whether one
belongs to certain associations, or a simple count of the number of organiza-
tional memberships one has (Somma 2010). While this measure focuses on the
scope of organizational involvement, it neglects the intensity of the involvement,
which is essential in fostering political participation (Wollebæk and Strømsnes
2007). Below we consider both aspects of organizational involvement and pro-
pose competing hypotheses.
2.2.1 The Scope of Organizational Involvement
Scholars argue that the scope of organizational involvement, which is measured
by the number of affiliations to which one belongs, is important in fostering
political participation (Hooghe 2003; Leighley 1996; Lim 2008; Mutz 2002; Paik
and Navarre-Jackson 2010; Paxton 2002 2007). They believe that multiple affilia-
tions in civic associations provide non-redundant information, cultivate shared
identification and trust, and convey a sense of cooperation and efficacy.
First, overlapping memberships indicate crosscutting ties, which function as
information systems, i. e., the bridging form of social capital that Burt (2000)
advocates. These bridging ties help disseminate knowledge about current issues
and how the association relates to them. A majority of civic associations now
send their members published newsletters, through which participants can be
informed about the goings-on in the association. Second, overlapping
How do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 7
memberships in several associations can cultivate a sense of identification and
trust, which can be transferred to several contexts and possibly to society as a
whole (Lim 2008; Park and Subramanian 2012; Wollebaek and Selle 2002).
Third, membership conveys a sense of the value of cooperation for common
purposes and of political efficacy (Paxton 2007). Therefore, it is likely that
individuals with more affiliations will participate more in politics. For example,
in a case study on an American civic association, Erickson and Nosanchuk
(1990) showed that associational involvement positively influences political
involvement by bringing participants into contact with politically active friends.
Wollebæk and Strømsnes (2007) found that multiple memberships have a very
strong effect on political engagement, because overlapping membership
between different organizations helps develop and disseminate social trust.
Similarly, Alexander et al. (2010)'s study revealed that people who associate
with a wider range of groups are more likely to be politically engaged than
those who are active within a small number of groups.
The effect of the scope of civic association on political participation may
vary across modes. Given that voting is a relatively individualized and anon-
ymous political act, it may not be affected by memberships. In contrast, formal
and informal modes of participation may be mobilized by overlapping networks.
Therefore, we hypothesize as follows,
H1 The number of affiliations in civic associations is positively associated with
formal mode of political participation.
H2 The number of affiliations in civic associations is positively associated with
informal mode of political participation.
2.2.2 The Intensity of Organizational Involvement
Contrary to the membership approach, scholars like Putnam (2000) and
Skocpol, Ganz, and Munson (2000) emphasized the benefits (e. g., social
capital, trust, norms) accrued from intense interactions within civic associa-
tions. Putnam (2000) believed that frequent face-to-face contact between
members helps foster societal trust and cooperative behavior which are essen-
tial to the vitality of American democracy. He claimed that social capital in the
United States is declining, because active voluntary associations are being
replaced by growing tertiary organizations (i. e., mailing list) in which mem-
bers do not interact personally. Skocpol, Ganz, and Munson (2000) took it one
step further and proposed that multi-tiered national federations consisting of
robust local chapters are key supports of classic American voluntarism
because they offer an institutional framework in which nationwide leadership
8 H. Li and J. Zhang
networks are sustained and career lines, resources, and incentives for member-
ship organizers are provided.
Individuals participate in civic associations by engaging in or even shaping
organizational activities, which include going to meetings where they take part
in decision making, planning or chairing a meeting, giving public speeches,
among others. Through participating in these activities, one may foster confi-
dence and efficacy, acquire democratic skills, inculcate civic virtues, and gain
political knowledge. Hence, those individuals who are more involved, or who
participate in more organizational activities, are considered "active members,"
and they are likely to engage more in politics because of their public-spirited-
ness and skills (Quintelier 2012; Somma 2010; Wollebæk and Strømsnes 2007;
Wollebaek and Selle 2002). As Berry, Portney, and Thomson (1993) eloquently
put, civic association "teaches people about the operations of governments,
affords them the opportunity to understand the potentials and limits of their
own personal influence, sharpens their cognitive skills and gives them the
experience necessary to develop self-confidence in their abilities" (p. 256).
Nonetheless, this effect may vary across different modes of political partici-
pation. As voting is a highly individualized and low-initiative political act, it
may not be affected much by the extent to which one engages in civic associa-
tions. The other two modes of political acts, including formal and informal
participation, may be fostered by one's intensity of involvement in civic associa-
tions. For example, through engaging in group discussions, one may have more
ideas of what constitutes effective political action and may act on it (Eliasoph
1998; Pollock 1982). Thus, the hypotheses are as follows,
H3 The depth of involvement in civic associations is positively associated with
formal mode of political participation.
H4 The depth of involvement in civic associations is positively associated with
informal mode of political participation.
3 Data and Method
3.1 Data Sources
To examine factors associated with different types of political participation, this
study uses data from the U.S. "Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy" (CID)
Survey, which was conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civil Society at
Georgetown University in 2006 (Howard, Gibson, and Stolle 2006). The survey
consisted of in-person interviews with a representative sample of 1,001
How do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 9
Americans whose age were 18 years old or over. The survey employed a clus-
tered sample design and achieved an overall response rate of 40 %. The CID
Survey covered a variety of questions, related to the participants' socioeconomic
status, political participation, voluntary associations, and personal networks.
Compared to the American Citizen Participation Study (Verba et al. 1990),1 which
is a widely-used dataset over the past two decades, the CID data provides
comparable level of details, but with updated information.
3.2 Dependent Variables
Three different modes of political participation are measured. The first is
binary, measuring one's participation in voting. The second set of dependent
variables measures different forms of political participation. It is derived from
a question that asked whether a respondent had participated in any of the
11 political activities in the year prior to 2006. Examples include contacting a
politician or a local government official, signing a petition, donating money to
a political organization or group, and participating in illegal protests. Based on
the characteristics of these activities, we categorize them into two distinct
modes of political participation ­ formal and informal. Formal participation
captures those activities that are more formal and institutionalized. The vari-
able consists of six items, including 1) contacting a politician or a local
government official; 2) working in a political party or action group; 3) working
for the campaign of a candidate for office; 4) working in another political
organization or association; 5) wearing or displaying a campaign badge/
sticker; and 6) donating money to a political organization or group. A higher
scale variable is created by summing the six items. Informal participation
involves those activities that are more informal and non-institutionalized.
This variable consists of five items, including 1) signing a petition; 2) taking
part in a lawful public demonstration; 3) boycotting a certain product;
4) deliberately buying certain products for political or ethical reasons; and
5) participating in illegal protests. The variable is calculated by summing the
above five items.
1 The American Citizen Participation Study (ACPS) is a survey of adults living in the United
States in 1989 and 1990. It was designed to examine political and nonpolitical civic participa-
tion. In the survey, respondents were asked to provide information on various topics, including
their interest in politics and their party identification, voting status, and activity in community
politics. Information on campaign activities and personal experiences with government pro-
grams and opinions on national and social problems was also collected.

3.3 Independent Variables
Two aspects of organizational involvement in civic associations are measured:
the scope and the intensity. The scope of organizational involvement is mea-
sured by the number of affiliations that one participates in any of the fifteen
civic associations, including 1) sports clubs, 2) cultural or hobby groups, 3) trade
unions, 4) business or professional organizations, 5) consumer or automobile
organizations, 6) human rights organizations, 7) religious organizations,
8) political parties, 9) neighborhood/homeowner associations, 10) veteran's
organizations, 11) ethnic or racial groups, 12) self-help groups, 13) organizations
for environmental protection, peace, or animal rights, 14) organizations for
science, education, or teachers and parents, and 15) organizations that provide
social services to the needy. The intensity of organizational involvement is a
scale ranging from 1 to 4 where 1 means one participates in one of the following
activities, including writing a letter, going to a meeting where one took part in
making decisions, planning or chairing a meeting, or giving a presentation or
speech in the organizations that one is most active at, and 4 means one
participates in all 4 activities.
3.4 Control Variables
The first set of control variables concerns one's socioeconomic status.
According to the standard socioeconomic model, which was first elucidated
by Verba and Nie (1972), political participation is primarily driven by one's
socioeconomic status and civic orientations. As high-status individuals are
better located in the social environments, they have more resources and
opportunities to enhance and cultivate participatory norms and civic skills.
Thus, compared to low-status individuals, those in a high socioeconomic
status are more likely to participate in politics.
Income and education are among the most important variables to measure
one's socioeconomic status. Education, because it enhances political interest
and civic skills, and income because of the monetary resources that it pro-
vides. Verba, Schlozman, and Brady (1995) and Kam and Palmer (2008), for
example, argue that education allows citizens to acquire necessary civic skills
to understand abstract political issues and communicate their concerns to
government officials and politicians. Therefore, people with higher income
and education may be more likely to use institutionalized channels, such as
voting and formal forms, to participate in politics. Given these options, they
may not choose to use informal means of participation.

Income is a categorical variable measuring a household's total annual net
income.2 It consists of eleven categories, with the lowest being less than
$15,000, and the highest $ 200,000 or more. Similarly, education is a catego-
rical variable. It covers 6 levels of educational attainment: 1) None, or grades
1­8, 2) High school incomplete ­ grades 9­11, 3) Business, technical, or voca-
tional school after high school, 4) Some college, no 4-year degree, 5) College
graduate, and 6) Post-graduate training, professional schooling after college.
It is expected that individuals with higher income and education are more likely
to engage in voting and formal mode of political participation.
The second set of control variables examines one's network mobilization.
The mobilization approach asserts that individuals are embedded in their social
networks where contextual cues and political opportunities may be supplied and
participation may be mobilized. Being asked to participate by one's political
party, groups of affiliation, family, friends, or others in the social networks,
makes one more likely to engage in political activities (e. g., Booth and Richard
1998; Brady, Schlozman, and Verba 1999; Bratton 1999; Huckfeldt and Sprague
1992; Kenny 1992; Knoke 1990). In the social movement literature, for example,
many studies have highlighted the positive association between recruitment and
the likelihood of one's engagement in protests, boycotts, or the like (Diani and
McAdam 2003; Fernandez and McAdam 1988; McAdam and Paulsen 1993;
Walker 2008). Therefore, mobilization allows people to live beyond personal
resource constraints and may narrow the participation gap between low and
high-status individuals (McClurg 2003).
Mobilization is a binary variable that captures whether an individual was
asked to vote, to contribute money to a political cause, or to engage in some other
type of political activity. It is coded as 1 if the individual was asked, 0 otherwise.
In addition, several other control variables, including age, gender, race,
party identification, political interests, and political efficacy, were considered.
Age is a subtraction of the year or birth from 2005, the year of the survey. It
ranges from 18 to 90. Gender is a binary variable in which 1 refers to male and 0
otherwise. The variable on race encompasses four dummy variables where
whites serve as the reference group. Party identification consists of two
2 According to the data coding handbook, the original question on the main income variable
has a great deal of missing data (including 95 refused, 29 don't know, 10 no answer). To correct
missing data problem, in the appendix of the released dataset, the author of the dataset,
Howard, Gibson and Stolle constructed a new variable ­ adjusted income ­ which is based
on imputations from a combination of homeownership, the interviewer's estimate of the
respondent's social class, the respondent's response to a question about "how you feel about
your household's income nowadays", and a follow-up question about whether the respondent's
income is "under $50,000 or $ 50,000 or more".
12 H. Li and J. Zhang
dummy variables where the independent serves as the reference group. The
variable on political interests measures how interested one is in politics, where
1 refers to she/he is not at all interested, 2 not very interested, 3 somewhat
interested, and 4 very interested. The last control variable, political efficacy, is
constructed from the question ­ "do you think that politicians care what people
like you think?" This is a 5-point scale variable, in which 1 refers to "hardly any
politics care what people like me think," and 5 means "most politicians care
what people like me think."
3.5 Analytic Techniques
As voting is a binary dependent variable, a logistic model is used. Given that
both formal and informal participation are count dependent variables and their
standard deviations are larger than their means, negative binomial regression
models are used (Cameron and Trivedi 2013; Long and Freese 2006). All the data
analysis is conducted using Stata 12.
4 Results
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the variables. On average, American
citizens participated in 2 out of 14 political activities in 2006. This echoes
Putnam (2000)'s argument regarding the decline of civic engagement.3
Compared to informal participation, citizens engage more in formal political
activities. Cross-tabulation results reveal that individual Americans who engage
in voting are also significantly more likely to participate in formal political
activities (chi-square = 81.07, p < 0.000). The results are similar in any other
two pairs of cross-tabulations. Thus, we suspect that the strong relationship
across different types of political participation is in large part due to the shared
individual- or organizational-level attributes (Jeong 2013).
3 In Bowling Alone, Putnam presented a series of evidence regarding the decline of civic
engagement: 1) voter turnout had declined by nearly a quarter from a relative high point in
the early 1960s to 1990; 2) membership in traditional women's groups had steadily declined;
3) the number of volunteers for civic organizations had significantly reduced; 4) the number of
Americans who report that "in the past year they have attended a public meeting on town or
school affairs" had fallen from 22 % in 1973 to 13 % in 1993; 5) the proportion of Americans who
reply that they "trust the government in Washington" only "some of the time" or "almost never"
had risen steadily from 30 % in 1966 to 75 % in 1992 (Putnam 2000, 65­78).
How do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 13
Table 3 displays the Pearson correlation coefficients for the variables described
above. The two independent variables are not highly correlated (r = 0.34), pro-
viding some confidence that they tap into different aspects of civic participation.
The correlation matrix also shows that the independent variables are all sig-
nificantly correlated with the three modes of political participation.
Table 4 presents three models with different modes of political participation
as the dependent variables. As the dependent variables for the first two models
are all count variables, the explanatory variables are thus the log of expected
counts. To facilitate interpretation, incidence rate ratio (IRR) is calculated. IRR
represents the estimated ratio for a one-unit increase in the independent vari-
ables, holding other variables constant in the model. The value of IRR is either
above or below 1. If IRR is above 1, the value from IRR minus 1 indicates the
extent to which the dependent variables increase with a one-unit change in the
independent variables, and vice versa.
Model 1 examines factors associated with formal mode of participation. On
average, holding constant other factors, with one additional increase in the
number of affiliations in civic associations, the expected log count of the
number of formal political acts increases by 0.058 (p < 0.05), supporting H1. In

other words, for each one-unit increase in the number of civic associations, the
expected number of political acts in which one engages increases by a factor of
1.059, or 5.9 %. Regarding the intensity of involvement, adjusting for other
factors, for each one-unit increase in the level of involvement in the voluntary
organization at which one is most active, the expected number of political acts
increases by 14.4 % (p < 0.001). H3 is supported. Thus, the intensity of involve-
ment matters more than the scope of memberships in formal participation.

Among the control variables, neither income nor education is statistically sig-
nificant. Compared to those who were not asked by their friends or relatives, the
expected number of formal political acts for those who were asked to participate
is 62.1 % higher (p < 0.001). This is consistent with the findings from social

who have a close relationship. This kind of embeddedness provides quality
information on politics, mutual trust, and certainty (McAdam and Paulsen
1993). In addition, holding constant other factors, compared to those who are
independent from both parties, the expected number of formal political acts for

those who consider themselves as more liberal is 90.7 % higher (p < 0.01), and
this number is 62.1 % higher for Republicans. Those who report being
more interested in politics engage more in formal political participation
(56.6 %, p < 0.001).
Model 2 examines factors associated with informal political participation.
Interestingly, the scope of memberships is not statistically significant anymore,
rejecting H2. The intensity of involvement remains significant, and the effect is
similar (16.4 %, p < 0.001) to that in formal political action. H4 is thus sup-
ported. Income is not statistically significant in predicting one's participation in
informal political activities, but education is negatively associated with infor-
mal political participation (p < 0.05). In other words, people with higher level of
education tend to engage in informal participation less. Furthermore, mobiliza-
tion remains significant. Adjusting for other factors, the expected number of
informal political acts for those who were asked to participate is 34.3 % higher
than for those who were not asked (p < 0.01). Political interest remains signifi-
cant (beta = 0.281, p < 0.001). The effect of age is consistent with what the
existing studies find. Controlling for other factors, one additional year of
increase in age decreases the expected count of informal political acts by
1.3 % (p < 0.001). This makes sense since younger people are usually more likely
to participate in demonstrations or illegal protests. Two of the race variables are
significant in this model. Holding constant other variables, compared to
Whites, the expected numbers of informal political acts for Blacks and
Hispanics are significantly lower by 34.8 % and 47.8 % (p < 0.01; p < 0.01),
respectively.
Model 3 examines factors associated with voting. Neither the scope nor the
intensity of organizational involvement matters. Education has a statistically
significant effect on voting. Controlling for other factors, one additional year
of education increases one's likelihood of participating in voting by 55.5 %
(p < 0.001). This effect is substantial, and it implies that more investment in
education will probably boost voting rate. Mobilization does not lead to higher
voter turnout. Age is statistically significant; one additional year of increase in
age increases one's likelihood of voting by 4.3 % (p < 0.001), adjusting for other
factors. Compared to Whites, Hispanics are statistically less likely to vote
(expected ratio = -65.6 %, p < 0.01). Republicans are much more likely (283 %)
to vote than independents, holding constant other factors. Consistent with the
negative binomial models, political interests is positively correlated with voting
(p < 0.05).
To summarize, the results show that memberships only explain one's
participation in the formal mode of political activities, and the intensity of
involvement, measured by the number of activities one performs at one's most
How do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 17
active voluntary association, is positively associated with both formal and
informal participation models. Neither the scope nor the intensity of organiza-
tional involvement explains voting behavior. This finding differs from Wollebæk
and Strømsnes (2007) and Alexander et al. (2010), both of which find that the
scope of organizational links has substantially strong explanatory power in
predicting political participation. Why is this so? Due to the unavailability of
data, we are unable to empirically examine this question. We suspect that the
difference in findings may be attributed to the distinct characteristics of various
modes of political participation. In particular, voting is more individualized
participation with minimal policy influence; thus civic associations are not
directly associated with voter turnout. Informal political activities are more
difficult to carry out and require more commitment. Active involvement in
civic associations helps foster political efficacy and "persuade" one to act;
simple affiliation may be unable to achieve this. Thus, membership is not
related to informal participation.
In addition, the socioeconomic status has more explanatory power in indi-
vidualized political activities, such as voting. While income is not significant in
all three models, education is highly significant in predicting voting and infor-
mal participation. Mobilization is positively associated with one's participation
in both formal and informal political activities, both of which require more time,
efforts, and resources to carry out. The requests from friends or relatives provide
an external stimulus to participation.
To further explore the effects of the intensity of involvement, we graphed the
expected number of political activities by intensity of involvement in civic
associations, adjusting for other factors, see Figure 1. The X-axis indicates the
number of activities one performs in the organization, and the Y-axis is the

predicted number of political activities. The two different patterns in the col-
umns indicate two different modes of political participation. We can see that as
one is more involved in civic associations, the number of political activities
increases across the two modes. But roughly, the increase is more substantial in
formal participation mode, suggesting that the effect of the intensity of involve-
ment is larger.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
Existing literature depicts the relationship between civic associations and
democracy from two perspectives (Torpe 2003). The first highlights the internal
democratic role of associations. Through participating in the internal life of
associations, one learns democratic norms and values, develops democratic
competences, and becomes more active in politics. The second focuses on the
external democratic role of associations, which are considered as intermediary
institutions between citizens and government. This paper joins the first perspec-
tive by examining how civic associations contribute to political participation.
Using the Citizenship, Involvement, and Democracy dataset, we showed that
participation in politics rises with participation in voluntary associations, even
when these associations are quite apolitical. Specifically, we disaggregated
political participation into three modes: formal, informal participation, and
voting. We then highlighted two aspects of involvement in civic associations:
the scope versus the intensity. The former argues that civic associations serve as
networks of bridging social ties through which novel information travel. The
more affiliations to which one belongs, the more exposed one is to social
influence, and thus, the more political activities one will participate in. In
contrast, the latter proposes that civic associations are socialization agents
through which the seeds for generalized social trust, identification, and cohe-
sion sprout. The more involved one is in the active associations, the more
political activities one will engage in. We found that the intensity argument is
supported in two types of political activities, including formal and informal
participation. However, the number of affiliations affects formal participation
but does not have a significant impact on informal participation. This is inter-
esting because it enriched our understanding on the longstanding debate
between bonding and bridging social capital (Burt 2000). Bonding ties are the
strong ties that exist within closed networks. They help disseminate information
among densely connected members within a certain group, reducing the cost of
obtaining information. They also help build and reinforce participants' identities
and cultivate collective norms. Knoke (1990), for example, examines the
How do Civic Associations Foster Political Participation? 19
networks of political action, arguing that when people discuss political matters
with their intimates very frequently, their interests and participation in national
campaigns and voting will be enhanced. In contrast, bridging ties are the weak
ties that exist between groups, creating "brokerage opportunities" and providing
non-redundant information (Burt 2000; Granovetter 1973). Our study found that
the intensity of organizational involvement matters more than the scope. Thus,
bonding social capital is more important in promoting political actions.
Furthermore, we found that the classic socioeconomic status model works
better in predicting individualized political activities, such as voting, whereas
mobilization has strong explanatory power in predicting both formal and infor-
mal political acts­those require more efforts and are more difficult to carry out.
This study contributes to the literature on political participation in three
ways. First, by identifying, conceptualizing, and unpacking political participa-
tion, it attempts to bring some conceptual order to a research area that has been
extensively explored in recent decades. Second, by incorporating these dimen-
sions in multivariate models, it disentangles the explanatory power of the often
discussed mechanisms in each type of political participation. Finally, by giving
special attention to organizational involvement and the mobilization effects, the
research highlights that compared to socioeconomic characteristics, associa-
tional life, especially one's depth of involvement in civic associations and social
network, have a more significant effect in political recruitment.
Our study carries important implications for policy makers and nonprofit
practitioners. Over the past two decades, the nonprofit sector has become
increasingly professionalized. Many small, local-based civic associations have
been replaced by large, membership-based associations in which members do
not have frequent interaction with each other and the organizations. The intense
face-to-face encounters and the benefits that these interactions generate seem to
have withered. However, it is these interactions that cultivate political interest,
efficacy, and participatory norms. Facilitating frequent interactions thus seems
critical. While the growth of nationwide, professionalized associations seems to
be an inevitable trend, establishing an institutional framework in which robust
local chapters are supported is a viable strategy. In particular, guidelines on
how to develop leadership, integrate resources, and engage members should be
provided to these local chapters. For nonprofit managers, more attention should
be paid to encourage citizens to involve actively in associational activities, such
as attending meetings, holding discussion sessions, or organizing activities. In
order to nurture the nonprofit sector, policy makers should focus their funds and
energies on building the capacity of local-based civic associations.
This study has limitations as well. The study only looks at one way of a
probably two-way relationship between voluntary and political participation.
20 H. Li and J. Zhang
Clearly, the two variables are interconnected and endogenous. That is, involve-
ment in voluntary organizations helps foster civic skills and democratic values
and thus can promote political participation, but in turn, political participation
may reinforce one's level of engagement in voluntary associations. As Diani
(2004) asserts, the process of movement participation is dynamic and diachronic
in the sense that memberships in voluntary organizations contribute to social
movement mobilization and this very participation also helps forge new bonds
among participants. Longitudinal data are required in order to address the
endogeneity problem. Nonetheless, we are cautious in establishing the link
between civic associations and political participation. When discussing the
role of civic associations, we confined our purview to involvements in organiza-
tions that do not take stands on public issues. This permits us to make the
assumption of causal priority for civic organizations. In addition, the dataset
used in this study was collected in 2006. Now that almost 10 years have passed,
it is possible that the participation landscape has changed greatly, and the
impact of the factors on political participation reported here may vary. Future
study should use a more up-to-date data set and examine how the mechanisms
shape various modes of political participation.
