The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services' (DHHS) Healthy People 2010 ini-
tiative has set a national goal of eliminating
blood lead (PbB) levels  10 µg/dL among
children 1­5 years of age by 2010 (DHHS
2000). PbB used to define unsafe levels of
exposure for children have decreased over
the past few decades as additional evidence
has demonstrated newly recognized adverse
health effects, even at relatively low expo-
sures [Canfield et al. 2003; Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) 1991;
Lanphear et al. 2005]. Childhood lead poi-
soning prevention efforts are sometimes called
a victory in light of the dramatic reductions
in population PbB. However, the magnitude
of ongoing exposures, the remaining large
stores of lead sources (particularly paint in
older housing), and the length of time it has
taken to address such exposures show that
much remains to be done if a true, lasting
victory is to be achieved (Jacobs et al. 2002;
Lanphear 2007; Levin et al. 2008). We pres-
ent new data on dust lead (PbD) loading and
childhood PbB from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999­2004 and examine their implications.
The most important source of lead expo-
sure for children today is from lead paint as it
deteriorates or is disturbed and subsequently
contaminates settled residential dust and soil
(Lanphear et al. 1998; Reissman et al. 2002).
Another important source of lead in dust
and soil is the estimated 5.9 million tons of
gasoline lead emitted from motor vehicles
before its removal in the mid-1980s (Mielke
1999). Normal hand-to-mouth activity
exposes young children to lead in the resi-
dential environment (Bornschein et al. 1987;
Lanphear et al. 1998). In 1999 and 2001,
respectively, the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) and the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
established a PbD standard for the home envi-
ronment of 40 µg/ft2, along with similar stan-
dards for windowsill PbD (250 µg/ft2) and
lead in soil [400 parts per million (ppm) in
play areas]. The previous guidance from U.S.
EPA was 100 µg/ft2 for floor PbD (U.S. EPA
1995). Prior studies have firmly established
the robust correlation of settled PbD on both
floors and windowsills with children's PbB
(Davies et al. 1990; Lanphear et al. 1998;
Wilson et al. 2007). However, analysis of
exposure pathways shows that floor PbD has a
direct effect on children's PbB, with sill PbD
having an indirect effect as mediated by floor
PbD (HUD 2004). Until recently, nationally
representative data for PbD and PbB (CDC
2005; Jacobs et al. 2002) were collected only
in separate surveys. But between 1999 and
2004, NHANES interviewers collected PbD
wipe samples and housing-related question-
naire data relevant to lead exposure from the
homes of children 1­5 years of age. Blood
samples from these children were collected at
NHANES mobile examination centers and
were analyzed for lead and other parameters.
We examined the relationship between PbB
in children and PbD on floors and window-
sills and estimated PbB across the range of
floor PbD in this nationally representative
cross-sectional sample of children 1­5 years
of age. This marks the first time that nation-
ally representative data on environmental and
biologic measurements for lead have been
obtained in a single integrated survey. A com-
panion article in this issue presents the predic-
tors of residential PbD (Gaitens et al 2009).
Methods
Study population. We analyzed data from
three waves of NHANES (1999­2000, 2001­
2002, 2003­2004). NHANES is a nation-
ally representative cross-sectional household
survey that uses a complex, stratified, multi
stage probability sampling design to track
the health of the noninstitutionalized civil-
ian U.S. population. It has been a primary
source of information about the national dis-
tribution of children's PbB. Details of the
NHANES protocol and all testing procedures
are available elsewhere (NCHS 2006a, 2006b,
2006c). Our data set included 2,155 children
12 to 60 months of age with measured PbB.
Only children living in housing built before
1978, when the United States banned the use
of lead in residential paint, were included in

Background: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected health, housing, and
environmental data in a single integrated national survey for the first time in the United States in
1999­2004.
Objectives: We aimed to determine how floor dust lead (PbD) loadings and other housing factors
influence childhood blood lead (PbB) levels and lead poisoning.
Methods: We analyzed data from the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), including 2,155 children 12­60 months of age with PbB and PbD measure-
ments. We used linear and logistic regression models to predict log-transformed PbB and the odds
that PbB was  5 and  10 µg/dL at a range of floor PbD.
Results: The population-weighted geometric mean (GM) PbB was 2.0 µg/dL (geometric standard
error = 1.0). Age of child, race/ethnicity, serum cotinine concentration, poverty-to-income ratio,
country of birth, year of building construction, floor PbD by floor surface and condition, windowsill
PbD, presence of deteriorated paint, home-apartment type, smoking in the home, and recent renova-
tion were significant predictors in either the linear model [the proportion of variability in the depen-
dent variable accounted for by the model (R2) = 40%] or logistic model for 10 µg/dL (R2 = 5%). At
floor PbD = 12 µg/ft2, the models predict that 4.6% of children living in homes constructed before
1978 have PbB  10 µg/dL, 27% have PbB  5 µg/dL, and the GM PbB is 3.9 µg/dL.
Conclusions: Lowering the floor PbD standard below the current standard of 40 µg/ft2 would
protect more children from elevated PbB.

the analysis of the influence of floor PbD on
children's PbB (n = 731).
Child, household, and housing character-
istics. NHANES interviewers collected data
on age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic
measures [family and household income and
poverty-to-income ratio (PIR)], and other
self-reported health data through a struc-
tured household interview. Participants
self-reported their race and ethnicity. In this
analysis, we used a composite race/ethnic-
ity variable: non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, Hispanic, or other race. These
variables, as well as the housing characteris-
tic variables, are described in the compan-
ion article. The PIR is the ratio of income
to the family's poverty threshold (Office of
Management and Budget 1978). PIR val-
ues < 1.00 are below the poverty threshold,
whereas PIR values of  1.00 indicate income
above the poverty level. Variables on smoking
behavior included the presence of smoking in
the home, number of smokers, and the num-
ber of cigarettes smoked in the home per day.
During their visit to the mobile examina-
tion center, NHANES participants provided
venous blood samples, which were analyzed
for PbB, serum cotinine, ferritin, iron, and
total iron binding capacity.
NHANES measured PbB using graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectro
photometry.
The laboratory detection limit (DL) was 0.3
µg/dL. Only 0.23% of the sample results were
below the DL. The DLs for cotinine were
0.05 ng/mL and 0.015 ng/mL for 1999­2000
and 2003­2004, respectively. For 2001­
2002, there was a mixture of these two DLs.
Twenty-six percent of the cotinine samples
were below the DL. For all NHANES labora-
tory measurements, results below the DL were
assigned the value of DL/

Statistical methods. Data were ana-
lyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0.0; RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC)
and SAS (SAS System for Windows, version
9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We used
a linear regression model to predict natural
log-transformed PbB and logistic regression
models to predict the probability that a child's
PbB exceeded either 5 or 10 µg/dL. The mod-
els adjusted the parameter estimates for the
clustering and unequal survey weights within
NHANES. The modeling employed Taylor
series expansion theory without degrees of
freedom adjustments. Backward elimina-
tion of insignificant independent variables
(p > 0.10) was followed by additional steps to
allow addition and/or removal of variables. To
provide an accurate prediction of children's
PbB without eliminating large fractions of the
study sample because of missing values, we fit
an intercept term for each variable that had a
missing value. The overall p-value is the type 3
F-test that captures the overall statistical
significance of each variable included in the
model. For categorical variables with missing
values, the missing level was not included in
this hypothesis test.
Because NHANES collected serum
cotinine only for children  3 years of age,
many more children had questionnaire-based
smoking data available than serum cotinine
measurements. Therefore, we gave question-
naire-based smoking variables priority over
measured serum cotinine levels.
Geometric mean (GM) PbB peaks
between 18 and 36 months of age and slowly
declines over the next few years, with the
rate of decline varying in different popula-
tions (Dietrich et al. 2001; Tong et al. 1996;
Wasserman et al. 1997). Based on the rela-
tionships between age and PbB observed in
these studies, we determined that a quartic
function of age of the child fit best.
Although most other analyses of the rela-
tionship between log PbB and log floor PbD
were based on a linear relationship, the rela-
tionship may not be linear across the relatively
low ranges observed in NHANES (Lanphear
et al. 1998; U.S. EPA 1998, 2001). To inves-
tigate this further, we analyzed other data sets:
the National Evaluation of the HUD Lead-
Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program
(the Evaluation) (Galke et al. 2001; HUD
2004); the Rochester Lead-in-Dust Study
(Rochester) (Lanphear et al. 1996a, 1996b);
and the HUD National Risk Assessment Study
(the RA Study) (Wilson et al. 2007). For each
of these data sets and NHANES, we predicted
log-PbB based on a cubic function of log floor
PbD for children < 6 years of age (Table 1).
The NHANES model accounted for clustering
and unequal survey weights.
We predicted PbB at different PbD levels
for children living in homes built before 1978
while controlling for other predictors of PbB
using the aforementioned linear and logis-
tic regression models and the population-
weighted averages of covariates (except floor
and sill PbD). For categorical variables, the
levels were weighted according to their pop-
ulation-weighted relative frequency distribu-
tion. For continuous covariate variables with
intercepts fit for missing values, the same
percent of missing values observed in the
population was assumed for the average risk
values. For windowsill PbD values, we used
a linear regression based on unweighted data
from homes built before 1978 (n = 601). The
correlation coefficient for the linear relation-
ship between natural log-transformed sill and
floor PbD is 0.38 (p < 0.001). The regression
equation is: ln(sill PbD) = 2.654+0.524 ×
ln(floor PbD) (r = 0.38, mean square error =
2.78; SE for the intercept and slope are 0.070
and 0.053, respectively).
The GM PbB and the probability that
PbB is  10 µg/dL and  5 µg/dL were pre-
dicted for floor PbD ranging from 0.25 to 40
µg/ft2 using the linear and logistic regression
models, respectively. Although exponentiation
of the predicted logarithm of the PbB may
slightly overestimate the expected GM PbB,
the large sample size minimizes the overesti-
mation (Teekens and Koerts 1972).
Results
Characteristics of the study population. PbB
data were available for 2,155 children 12­60
months of age. The population-weighted
GM PbB was 2.03 µg/dL. Eight percent
were  5 µg/dL, 1.71% were  10 µg/dL, and
0.33% were  15 µg/dL. Gaitens et al. (2009)
present the descriptive statistics for PbD and
additional housing variables. Here we present
descriptive statistics for variables found to be
significant (p < 0.10) in the PbB model (Tables
2 and 3). The weighted distribution shows that
approximately 57% of the sampled population
was non-Hispanic white, 15% was non-His-
panic black, and 24% was Hispanic. The vast
majority (97.43%) of the children were born
in the United States. Fifty-eight percent lived
in a single-family detached house, and almost
one-quarter lived in an apartment. Fifty-two
percent of the homes for which data on the
year of construction were available were built
before 1978. Approximately 6% of homes
were built before 1950 and had evidence of
deteriorated paint (i.e., peeling, flaking, or
chipping paint) inside. Ten percent of chil-
dren lived in pre-1978 homes where window,

PbB modeling results. Although the mod-
els to predict log-PbB based on a cubic func-
tion of log floor PbD indicated that the cubic
terms are not significant for two of the three
data sets (the HUD Evaluation and Rochester),
the quadratic terms were significant for all
four data sets (Table 1). Figure 1 presents the
predicted functions for the four data sets from
the 5th to 95th floor PbD percentiles for each
study except NHANES, which goes up to
the 99.5th percentile (24.2 µg/ft2). The figure
shows that the slope and curvature of the rela-
tionship between log floor PbD and log PbB
observed for the NHANES data are similar to
other studies.
Children's PbB is strongly predicted by
floor PbD and surface type and condition of
floor (Table 4), with higher PbB associated
with uncarpeted floors that were not smooth
and not cleanable. Differences in the effect of
PbD on PbB for uncarpeted smooth and clean-
able, low-pile carpet and high-pile carpet were
not significant, so these surfaces/conditions
were combined. Natural log-
transformed win-
dowsill PbD, PIR, and age were also significant
predictors of PbB.
Non-Hispanic black children had signifi-
cantly higher PbB than non-Hispanic whites
(p < 0.001). Country of birth was also a
significant predictor of PbB, with Mexican-
born associated with higher PbB (p = 0.003).
Children living in apartment buildings with
 10 units were found to have lower PbB than
children living in single-family detached or
attached dwellings (p = 0.005 and p = 0.022,
respectively). As expected, children living in
newer housing have significantly lower PbB
compared with children living in housing built
before 1940 (p < 0.001). Children living in
homes built before 1978 that had renovation
(within the preceding 12 months), which often
disturbs paint lead, had higher PbB (p = 0.045).
Children who resided in a home where
smoking occurred inside had significantly
higher PbB than children who lived in homes
with no smoking (p = 0.015). Even after con-
trolling for the presence of smoking in the
linear model, increasing log cotinine concen-
trations were associated with increasing PbB
(p = 0.002).
Table 5 presents the logistic regres-
sion results for predicting PbB  5 µg/dL
and  10 µg/dL. If a variable was significant
in one logistic regression model but not the
other model, the cells for the variable contain

that were significant in the linear regres-
sion model were also significant in the 5 µg/

logistic regression model identified fewer sig-
nificant predictors. The proportion of vari-
ability in the dependent variable accounted
for by the model (R2) for the 5 µg/dL and
10 µg/dL logistic models were much lower
than for the linear model (16% and 5% vs.

dL for non-Hispanic blacks were about twice
those of non-Hispanic whites [odd ratio (OR)
= 2.04 and 2.01, respectively]. The odds of a
PbB  5 µg/dL for children born in Mexico
were 11.69 times those of children born in
the United States. However, country of birth
was not a significant factor in predicting
PbB  10 µg/dL. The odds of having a PbB
 5 µg/dL were more than three times higher
for children living in pre-1950 housing with
renovation than for children living in other
homes (OR = 3.33). The odds of having a
PbB  10 µg/dL were more than three times
higher for children living in pre-1950 housing
with deteriorated paint inside than for chil-
dren living in other homes (OR = 3.53).
Floor PbD thresholds. Table 6 presents
the model predictions for average children
living in a pre-1978 home for a range of
floor PbD after controlling for the covariates
described above. At a floor PbD of 6 µg/ft2,
the models predict that 2.7% of children have
PbB  10 µg/dL and 16.5% have PbB  5 µg/
dL, and that the GM PbB is 3.4 µg/dL. When
floor PbD is 12 µg/ft2, the models predict
that 4.6% of children have PbB  10 µg/dL
and 26.8% have PbB  5 µg/dL, and that the
GM PbB is 3.9 µg/dL. The upper bound of
the 90% confidence interval (CI) for a predic-
tion approximates the 95% upper bound for
the prediction. For example, when floor PbD
is 12 µg/ft2, the 90% CI for the probability
that PbB is  10 µg/dL is between 2.7 and
7.9%. This means that we are approximately
95% confident that the probability that PbB
 10 µg/dL is < 7.9%. The information pre-
sented assumes that floor PbD is equal to the
specified value. If floor PbD is less than the
specified value, the predicted GM PbB and
probabilities would be lower than those in
Table 6.
Discussion
We found the GM PbB for children 12­60
months of age in the United States between
1999 and 2004 was 2 µg/dL and that 20 chil-
dren per 1,000 had PbB  10 µg/dL. A prior
study analyzing NHANES data collected
1994­1998 found that 63 children per 1,000
had PbB  10 µg/dL (Bernard and McGeehin
2003). Our findings show that 81 children
per thousand had PbB  5 µg/dL. Although
there is a clear and significant decline over
time in childhood lead exposure demonstrated
by these prevalence estimates from NHANES,
there is still an unacceptable number of

children who are poisoned each year.
Age, race/ethnicity, PIR, and year of
construction of housing all significantly pre-
dicted PbB of children, which is consistent
with other studies (CDC 2005; Pirkle et al.
1994). Prior studies also found that PbB is
typically higher in African-American children
than in white children (Lanphear et al. 1996a,
2002; Raymond et al. 2007) and is higher in
children living in poverty and in older homes
(CDC 2005).
Previous studies using NHANES data
have also documented the relationship
between exposure to tobacco smoke and PbB
(Bernard and McGeehin 2003; Mannino
et al. 2003). Similar to our finding that serum
cotinine was associated with PbB  10 µg/dL,
Mannino et al. (2003) found that high levels
of serum cotinine (a biomarker of exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke) for older

children 4­16 years of age was associated with
PbB  10 µg/dL.
Prior studies have not demonstrated that
children living in apartment buildings with
 10 units are more likely to have lower PbB
than children living in single-family detached
houses. Although apartment buildings with
 10 units tended to be of more recent con-
struction than single-family detached homes
and smaller apartment building (5%, 17%, and
78% constructed before 1940, respectively),
not all the effect of home-apartment type is
captured by the year of construction, because
both variables are significant in the model.
Although other studies suggest that lead haz-
ards are more likely to be found in rental units
than in owner-occupied properties (Jacobs
et al. 2002), it is possible that owners of large
apartment buildings may have more resources
available for scheduled maintenance programs,
which could help address lead hazards, com-
pared with owners of smaller apartment build-
ings and single-family detached homes.
Despite having a relatively small num-
ber of children who were born outside the
United States, our results indicate that
Mexican-born was a strong predictor of PbB.
A previous study examining the PbB of chil-
dren living along the U.S.­Mexico border
also found that children living in Mexico had
higher PbB than children living in the United
States. (Cowan et al. 2006). This finding
may reflect continued use of lead-containing
items imported from Mexico (e.g., pottery,
foods, folk medicine) by families that recently
resided there. Research has documented that
use of these items can result in elevated PbB
in children (CDC 1991).
Additionally, our study supports the asso-
ciation between PbB and renovation and floor
and sill PbD, as expected. Other studies have
shown that renovation activities can influence
floor PbD (Reissman et al. 2002) and that
floor PbD is a strong predictor of a child's
PbB (Davies et al. 1990; Lanphear et al. 1998;
Rabinowitz et al. 1985; Wilson et al. 2007).
The U.S. EPA (2008) recently promulgated a
regulation intended to control lead exposures
from renovation.
The rate of change in PbB with respect to
floor PbD levels observed in this most recent
NHANES analysis is similar to that found
in three other studies analyzed here: the
Evaluation, the RA Study, and the Rochester
Study (Table 1). These other data sets are
from higher-risk populations and therefore
have higher PbD and PbB levels. The simi-
larities in the PbB/PbD slope in the different
studies indicate that it is reasonable to use the
NHANES data to make inferences at higher
floor PbD and PbB.
The current federal floor PbD standard
of 40 µg/ft2 was established based on pre-
1995 data from the Rochester Lead-in-Dust
Study and a pooled analysis of 12 older epide-
miologic studies using slightly different meth-
ods (HUD 1999; Lanphear et al. 1998; U.S.
EPA 1998, 2001). The Rochester cohort and
most of the studies comprising the pooled
analysis were based on high-risk children and
housing. The pooled analysis estimated that
95.3% of children 6­36 months of age would
be protected from having a PbB  15 µg/
dL, using a floor PbD threshold of 40 µg/
ft2 and holding other sources of lead to their
respective national averages in the residen-
tial environment (Lanphear et al. 1998). In
the U.S. EPA analysis, the floor standard of
40 µg/ft2 was established jointly with stan-
dards for lead in windowsill dust, soil, and
interior paint to protect at least 95% of chil-
dren 12­30 months of age from developing a
PbB  10 µg/dL when the windowsill and soil
lead standards were also met (U.S. EPA 1998,
2001). Although the current 40 µg/ft2 stan-
dard was based on protecting children from
developing high PbB (i.e., PbB  10 µg/dL

or  15 µg/dL), the importance of preventing
lower childhood lead exposure is illustrated
by research that has demonstrated signifi-
cant lead-related IQ decrements in children
with PbB < 10 µg/dL (Canfield et al. 2003;
Lanphear et al. 2005).
A strength of our study is that we were
able to show the relationship of a range of
floor PbD levels on children's PbB while con-
trolling for other significant predictors in a
nationally representative sample of children.
PbD and PbB from 1999 to 2004 were much
lower than those observed in the earlier studies
of higher-risk populations that were the foun-
dation of the current floor PbD standard. In
fact, these new data made the logistic model
to predict PbB  10 µg/dL problematic,
because only 2% of PbB (n = 51 of 2,155)
were  10 µg/dL. Consequently, the percent
of variation (R2) explained by the predictors
in the 10 µg/dL logistic model was much
lower than that of the linear model (R2 = 5%
vs. R2 = 40%). We present the logistic regres-
sion model for 5 µg/dL because no other PbB
thresholds have regulatory significance, and
11% of children had PbB  5 µg/dL (237
of 2,155 children; R2 = 16%). Iqbal et al.
(2008) suggest that the threshold for elevated
PbB may be lowered from 10 to 5 µg/dL and
examines the impact of this reduction.
NHANES collected both health and
environmental data from a nationally repre-
sentative sample of children between 12 and
60 months of age; however, the NHANES
data are not necessarily representative of the
U.S. housing stock. Iqbal and collaborators
(2008) found that for NHANES 1999­2002,
a large number of children 1­5 years of age
in NHANES (16.3%) had missing PbB val-
ues. Non-Hispanic white children, homeown-
ers, and children from households with high
income levels and with health insurance had a
higher percentage of missing PbB values. This
may have inflated the estimates of GM PbB
and overestimated the prevalence of PbB  5
µg/dL and PbB  10 µg/dL.
In addition, NHANES collected only a
single floor PbD measurement in each house.
Although the single measurement was from
the room in which the children spent the
most time, the average of several floor dust
samples would likely provide a more precise
estimate of a child's total exposure.
In this article we examined PbB across
a range of floor PbD. An analysis of expo-
sure pathways found that floor PbD has a
direct effect on children's PbB, whereas sill
PbD has an indirect effect on children's PbB
as mediated by floor PbD (HUD 2004). In
the NHANES data analyzed in this article,
floor PbD is more predictive of PbB than
sill PbD (R2 = 19.4% for floors; R2 = 11.9%
for sills; R2 = 23.0% for floors and sills com-
bined). When floor PbD = 12 µg/ft2, we show
that 4.6% of children have PbB  10 µg/dL
(Table 6). Based on the logistic model for
10 µg/dL, when floor PbD = 12 µg/ft2, sill
PbD = 90 µg/ft2, and other covariates are at
their national averages, the model predicts
that 95% of children have PbB < 10 µg/dL.
If homes have floor PbD below 12 µg/ft2 and
sill PbD below 90 µg/ft2, less than 5% of chil-
dren would have PbB  10 µg/dL.
The national estimate of the GM floor
PbD in U.S. housing for 1998­2000 was
1.1 µg/ft2 (Jacobs et al. 2002). Furthermore,
data from high-risk houses in the HUD evalu-
ation study showed that PbD on floors contin-
ued to decline after the intervention, dropping
from a GM of 14 µg/ft2 immediately after
intervention to a GM of only 4.8 µg/ft2 6 years
after hazard control (Wilson et al. 2006).
Together, these data demonstrate that floor
PbD is well below the current federal standard
of  40 µg/ft2 for the vast majority of houses.
Historically, allowable PbD levels have
declined as research has progressed. In the
early 1990s, Maryland enacted a floor PbD
standard of  200 µg/ft2 (Code of Maryland
1988). U.S. EPA issued guidance in 1995
lowering the floor PbD level to  100 µg/ft2,
and in 1999­2001, HUD and U.S. EPA pro-
mulgated a floor PbD standard of  40 µg/ft2,
which has remained unchanged. Our find-
ings suggest that floor and windowsill PbD
should be kept as low as possible. Levels
of PbD on floors between 6 µg/ft2 and
12 µg/ft2 can be expected to protect most
children living in pre-1978 homes from hav-
ing PbB  10 µg/dL. Protection at lower PbB
would require lower PbD.
