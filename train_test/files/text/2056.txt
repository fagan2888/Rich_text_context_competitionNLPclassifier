Abstract
Mexican American children are disproportionately affected by obesity. Data on how the acculturation process influences
diet and body weight among adolescents are limited. We used the data from the 1999­2004 NHANES, restricting to 2286
Mexican American children between 12 and 19 y old. Acculturation was measured by generation status and language
preference. Diet was assessed using 24-h diet recall. Multiple linear, Tobit, logistic, and quantile regression models were
used. We found, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, health, dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary
behaviors compared to the first generation, second and third generations had greater odds of overweight and obesity.
Adolescents in the second generation had higher BMI Z-scores than adolescents in the first and third generations. Both
second and third generation adolescents consumed less fruit, whole fruit, vegetables, grains, and meats but more
sweetened beverages, whole grains, saturated fat, sodium, oil, and energy from discretionary foods. Higher language
acculturation was associated with poorer diet and greater body weight. Our findings suggest that Mexican American
adolescents face challenges in terms of poorer diet and excessive weight gain associated with their immigration
experience. J. Nutr. 142: 298­305, 2012.
Introduction
The prevalence of obesity among Mexican American adolescents is
higher and has been increasing more rapidly than among non-
Hispanic white adolescents in the past 3 decades (1­4). Mexico as a
country of origin is also experiencing an obesity epidemic (5). Thus,
foreign-born, Mexican American children may experience risk
factors for obesity in both their origin and destination countries.
The existing literature on associations between acculturation,
weight status, and diet intake mainly focus on adults. Foreign-
born Hispanic adults have a lower prevalence of obesity than U.
S.-born adults (6). Adults' risk of obesity increases with length of
residence in the U.S. (6­10) and obesity risk increases with each
subsequent generation (11). When language preference is used as
a proxy for acculturation, immigrant Hispanic women who are
fluent in English are at a greater risk of being obese than those
who are less fluent (12,13). Furthermore, highly acculturated
Hispanic adults reported consuming fewer servings of fruits and
vegetables compared to less acculturated Hispanics (14).
Although these associations found in adults provide insight
about possible associations among adolescents, investigating the
relationships among adolescents is important, because they may
undergo acculturation differently than adults. For example,
adolescents directly interact with their peers who may influence
their acculturation to the US. They may request desired foods
and their parents usually accommodate their preferences (15).
Limited and mixed findings are available about links between
acculturation and weight status among Hispanic adolescents.
Multiple review articles (16­18) have called for more studies on
the influence of acculturation on diet among children and
adolescents. To our knowledge, only four studies have assessed
influences of immigration status and the child's acculturation on
obesity (19­22), excluding studies using parental acculturation
measures (23­25). Higher age- and gender-adjusted prevalence
of overweight (BMI $ 85th percentile) was reported among
second- and third-generation compared to first-generation
Hispanic adolescents (19), but that study did not adjust for
SES7, which is known to be lower among immigrants (26).
Another study using the same data source but a different weight
measure found that acculturation measures were not related to
adolescent obesity (i.e., BMI $ 95th percentile) after adjusting
for SES and demographic characteristics (20). Both U.S.-born
and foreign-born boys who resided in the US for .10 y were
more likely to be overweight than foreign-born boys with a
shorter length of residence (21). Lastly, obesity prevalence was

Resources and Services Administration (R40MC17167, PI: J-H. Liu).

higher among non-English speaking adolescents, but the same
relationship was not observed when using the generation status.
After additional adjustment of SES and demographic factors, the
association became insignificant (22).
Mixed findings likely reflect differences in study populations,
acculturation measures, immigrant status, methods of assessing
height and weight, and confounding factors considered in the
analyses. Of the studies found, two included a limited number of
foreign-born children (i.e., ,350) (20,21) and one did not address
the nativity of children (21). One large study used height and
weight reported by parents, which are prone to measurement
error (22). Only one study considered the influences of diet and
physical activity as mediators of the association between accul-
turation and weight status (20). Therefore, utilizing a quality
nationally representative data set with a large sample of foreign-
born children, measured weight and height data, and broad range
of potential confounders and mediating factors relevant to obesity
may address the limitations of the past studies.
Our overall objective was to examine how the acculturation
process, measured by generation status and language use, is
associated with both diet and obesity among Mexican American
adolescents aged 12­19 y old. We also investigated whether the
association between acculturation and weight status is mediated
by dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors.
Data and Methods
Data were from NHANES, a cross-sectional national health survey with
a complex, stratified, multistage probability sampling design. NHANES
provides the nutrition and health status of the U.S. civilian and
noninstitutionalized population (27). Data for NHANES are collected
through in-home interviews (e.g., demographics, acculturation mea-
sures, and health interviews) and a physical examination conducted in
a mobile center (e.g., 24-h dietary interview, height and weight
measurements). The 1999­2004 NHANES oversampled Mexican Amer-
icans and obtained multiple measures of acculturation among Hispanic
participants who were 12 y old or older. We restricted our sample to
Mexican American adolescents 12­19 y of age (n = 2443) and excluded
75 respondents without any data on physical examination, 46 pregnant
respondents, and 36 respondents without height and weight data
(yielding n = 2286). This sample was used when generation status alone
was the measure of acculturation. When using language as the
acculturation measure, we excluded an additional 68 adolescents with
missing values for language (yielding n = 2218). The study was approved
by the institutional review board at the University of South Carolina.
Measures
Acculturation measures. Immigration represents physical relocation,
whereas acculturation represents the degree to which the immigrant
learns and adopts certain aspects of the dominant culture and/or retains
most or some aspects of their culture of origin after the relocation
(16,28). Detailed information about adolescents' acculturation level may
be difficult to obtain or simply unavailable (18). Therefore, many
researchers opt to use one or multiple proxies including the place of
birth, age of arrival, and language spoken in the host country.
Using information available in NHANES, we assessed acculturation
in two ways: generation status and language preference. Although the
two measures are correlated, the use of both enabled us check the
robustness of the associations of interest and make our findings com-
parable to the findings from studies using different measures. Gen-
erational status was determined by respondents' birthplace and their
parents' birthplace. Respondents were categorized into first generation if
the adolescent was not US born and at least one parent was also non-US
born; second generation if the adolescent was US born but at least one
parent was non-US born; and third generation if the adolescent and both
parents were US born (11,29). Only six U.S.-born adolescents who had
no information on two parents' nativity were coded in the category of
second generation.
NHANES used the validated 5-item Short Acculturation Scale for
Hispanics to assess language preferences (17,29,30). Respondents
indicated their preference for language used to read, think, speak at
home, as a child, and with friends, respectively, using a scale from 0 to 4,
where 0 = only Spanish, 1 = more Spanish than English, 2 = both equally,
3 = more English than Spanish, and 4 = only English. Their responses
were summed and further categorized as "minimal use of English" if the
total score was #5, "some use of English" if the score was between 6 and
19, and "only use of English" if the total score was 20.
Diet. NHANES collected diet data through a 1-d, 24-h dietary recall
interview. Using this information, we first created the 2005 HEI score of
the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which assesses
diet quality according to federal dietary guidance (31). The total HEI
score ranges from 1 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better quality
of diet. Second, we assessed dietary intake based on the consumption of
12 dietary constituents that were used to calculate the total HEI score.
These constituents represent all of the major food groups in MyPyramid
(total fruit, total vegetables, milk, meat, and beans) plus 8 additional
components (whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables, grains,
whole grains, oils, saturated fat, sodium, and energy from SoFAAS). We
also assessed consumption of sweetened beverages. All dietary variables
represented the actual amount of intake except saturated fat, which was
based on the percentage of the total daily energy intake from fat. We top-
coded responses for intake of sodium, total grains, total energy, and
servings of sweetened beverages; this affected 2­10 respondents.
Weight status. NHANES used digital scales and stadiometers to
measure height and weight for all respondents. BMI was calculated as
weight divided by the square of height (kg/m2). Using the gender-specific
BMI-for-age growth charts from the CDC, children whose BMI-for-age
and -gender was in the 95th percentile or greater were classified as obese
(32). We also examined age- and gender-specific BMI Z-score as a
continuous measure.
Covariates. To adjust for potential confounding effects, we considered
the following covariates: age, gender, parental education (,12, =12,
.12 y), health status (excellent, very good, #good), in-school status (in
school, in vacation, out of school), and poverty level (#130, 131­185,
186­250, and .250% of the federal poverty level). In addition to diet,
we also considered physical activity and sedentary behaviors as potential
mediators. A binary variable was created for respondents' self-report of
participation in vigorous leisure time physical activities lasting .10 min
in the past 30 d. Sedentary behavior, measured by the mean daily hours
sitting and watching television or using a computer in the past 30 d, was
dichotomized into ,4 and $4 h/d.
Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata for Mac 10.1
(StataCorp) using sampling weights that account for the complex
sampling design and nonresponse. P # 0.05 was accepted as significant.
Chi-square tests were used to assess whether adolescents at different
levels of acculturation differ by their categorical socio-demographic
characteristics. We used F-tests to compare continuous measures such as
respondents' age, BMI Z-scores, and dietary intake variables by
acculturation measures.
Linear regression models were used to examine associations between
acculturation measures with continuous dietary measures such as HEI
score, dietary components (total grains, meats and beans, saturated fat,
sodium, SoFAAS), and sweetened beverages. For the other seven dietary
components (total fruit, whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables,
whole grains, total dairy, and oil), a large number of respondents reported
consuming zero servings in their 24-h dietary recall. Tobit regression
models were used for these measures to account for censoring at zero
(33,34). When modeling diet, we ran both crude models with only
acculturation measures as the independent variables and adjusted models
that included age, gender, parental education, total energy intake, poverty
status, self-reported health status, in-school status, and survey years.
Weight status was modeled in two forms: continuous BMI Z-scores
and dichotomized obesity status (i.e., BMI $ 95th percentile). We used
linear regression models for continuous BMI Z-scores and logistic
regression model for obesity. We used an incremental modeling strategy

to examine the possible mediating effects of obesity-related behaviors
(such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors) (35). Model
1 adjusted for age, gender, height, and an interaction term between
height and age. In model 2, we further adjusted for parental education,
poverty status, self-reported health, in-school status, and survey year. In
model 3, we added total energy intake, all dietary component variables,
and sweetened beverage intake. In model 4, we further added respon-
dent's participation in vigorous leisure time physical activities and
sedentary behaviors.
To further examine how acculturation affects the distribution of the
BMI Z-score, we used quantile regression models with 10% increments
of BMI Z-scores and adjusted for all covariates listed above (36,37). Due
to software limitations, we could not account for the complex survey
design of NHANES in our quantile regression models. Nevertheless,
these models shed additional light by highlighting in which part of the
BMI distribution the impacts most occur (38).
Results
Study population. In our analytic sample, 27.9, 42.7, and
29.4% of adolescents were first, second, and third generation,
respectively (Table 1). The majority reported using some English
(62.6%), with 21.5% of the sample using only English and
15.9% using minimal English. The two acculturation measures
were correlated, but 13.5% of those first generation and 12.5%
of those in the third generation reported some use of English. On
average, respondents were 15.4 y old; those in the first
generation and those who spoke minimal English were older.
There were significantly more boys than girls, particularly in the
first generation and among those who reported minimal use of
English. Adolescents who were first generation or reported
minimal use of English were more likely to have parents with less
than a high school education, to live in low-income families, to
report being in "good, fair, or poor health," and to be out of
school. Adolescents in the third generation or who only used
English were more likely to report participating in vigorous
physical activities in the past 30 d. No significant difference in
screen time was observed across generational status or the short
acculturation scale.
Diet. Compared to first-generation adolescents, both second and
third generation children had lower HEI scores, indicating
poorer dietary quality overall (Table 2). Second and third
generation adolescents consumed significantly less total fruit,
whole fruit, total vegetables, dark green vegetables, and meats
and beans. Intake of whole grains, saturated fat, and sodium
were significantly greater for both second and third generation

than first-generation adolescents. The energy intake from
SoFAAS and the consumption of sweetened beverages were
higher for those in the third generation. Similar patterns were
found across the short acculturation scale (data not shown).
Table 3 presents the crude and adjusted coefficients for
dietary intake variables by generation status. In terms of overall
dietary quality, after adjusting for covariates, HEI scores were
lower among those in the second generation (23.2) and third
generation (25.6), respectively, compared to those in the first
generation. Adolescents in the second and third generation had
lower intake of total fruit, whole fruit, dark green vegetables,
total grains, and meats and beans than those in the first gen-
eration. Adolescents in the second and third generations also had
higher intake of whole grains and higher energy coming from
saturated fat or SoFAAS than those in the first generation.
Compared to the first generation, the third generation reported
lower intake of total vegetables and higher intake of total oil and
sweetened beverages, which were not shown with the second
generation. The third generation was significantly different from
the second generation in total fruit, whole fruit, dark green
vegetables, sodium intake, SoFAAS, and sweetened beverages.
Overall, as generation status increased, diet quality declined.
Similar patterns but greater differences in the dietary intake were
observed when using the acculturation measure based on the
short acculturation scales (data not shown).
Weight status. The second and third generation Mexican
American adolescents had significantly higher odds of being
obese than those in the first generation [adjusted OR for second
generation: 2.58 (95% CI = 2.04, 3.27); adjusted OR for third
generation: 1.98 (95% CI = 1.34, 2.95)] (Table 4). When using
the short acculturation scale, the association between accultur-
ation and obesity was stronger. That is, those who reported some
use of English or only used English had ;4 times higher odds of
being obese than those who reported minimal use of English.
The OR between the second and third generation were not
significantly different. Socio-demographic, health risk factors,
and dietary factors mediated the association between accultur-
ation measures and obesity. Adjustment of socio-demographic
and health factors changed the association most among the third
generation or those who only used English. Additional adjust-
ment of dietary intake led to ;10% change in the point estimate
among the second generation but not in the third generation and
among those who used some English or used only English. Further
adjustment of physical activity and sedentary behaviors did not
change the magnitude of the association.
With continuous BMI Z-scores as the outcome, adolescents
in the second generation or those who reported some use of
English had higher BMI Z-scores than other generational status
(i.e., first or third generation) or levels of acculturation (i.e.,
minimal use of English or only use English), respectively (Table
2). Adolescents in the second generation on average had higher
BMI Z-scores (0.32, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.44) than those in the first
generation after adjusting for socio-demographic and health risk
factors and dietary intake. This difference did not change with
further adjustment of physical activity and sedentary behavior
variables. Adolescents in the third generation on average had
similar BMI Z-scores as those in the first generation but lower
BMI Z-scores than those for the second generation. Similarly,
those who reported some use of English had higher BMI Z-
scores than those who used minimal English or only English in
their life (Table 4).
Results from quantile regression provided additional infor-
mation about the effects of acculturation measures on the whole
distribution of BMI Z-scores (Fig. 1). Compared to the first
generation, as BMI percentiles increased from the 50th to the
90th percentiles, the second generation on average had signif-
icantly higher BMI Z-scores (range: 0.35­0.46) and the third
generation also had higher BMI Z-scores (range: 0.18­0.38).
The change in BMI Z-scores was smaller across the distribution
in the third generation than that for the second generation. The
same findings were observed when we ran the analysis using the
short acculturation scale but the differences are smaller compared
to those observed using generation status (data not shown).

Discussion
Second and third generation Mexican American adolescents
reported poorer dietary quality than the first generation. The
second-generation adolescents consumed less fruit, dark green
vegetables, total grains, and meat and beans but more saturated
fat, sodium, and sweetened beverages than the first generation.
In some dietary variables, the third generation had a much
poorer diet than the second generation. Acculturated adoles-
cents had 2­4 times higher odds of being overweight and obese
than less acculturated adolescents (i.e., those in the first
generation or using minimal English). These differences per-
sisted even after adjusting for diet, physical activity, and
sedentary behaviors. A similar pattern was observed when we

used a validated acculturation scale based on language prefer-
ence. Our study demonstrates that higher acculturation is
associated with poorer diet and higher weight. These findings
are consistent with previous studies on weight status among
children and adults (7,10­12) and diet among adults (14,39).
Previous studies have not examined how the entire BMI
distribution might differ by acculturation status among adoles-
cents. We found that those in the second generation or those
reporting some use of English had higher BMI Z-scores than
those in the first and third generations. Higher acculturation has
a large impact at the higher end of BMI percentiles. What makes
those with the intermediate level of acculturation status stand
out? Although we cannot further examine our finding using the
NHANES cross-sectional data, this might reflect a parental
cohort effect. That is, those in the second generation or those
who reported some use of English might be influenced more by
the obesogenic environment in the US or they might adopt an
unhealthy diet more readily than the third generation or those
who speak only English. With a better SES, the highly accultur-
ated adolescents might prefer a thin body type and thus might
partially prevent excessive weight gain. The relationship with
BMI Z-score was particularly mediated by socio-demographic
factors for both second and third generations and those who
used only English. Dietary intake mediated the effects of
acculturation and BMI Z-score among those who used some
English. Additional analysis restricted to the second generation
found that those with foreign-born parents had lower total
energy intake (1.78 Mcal/d) than those with U.S.-born parents,
although no other differences in dietary components were
found. Thus, detailed information on the gender of the parents,
the timing of relocation of the parents, and parental accultur-
ation levels will be useful to better understand higher BMI
among those adolescents with intermediate levels of accultura-
tion. Future studies should also investigate possible differential
mechanisms by levels of acculturation.
Our study draws strength from examining obesity-related
risk behaviors such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary
behaviors among immigrant Mexican American adolescents

using nationally representative data as well as a large number of
foreign-born adolescents. We also used measured weight and
height data and analyzed weight status both as a categorical and
a continuous variable.
Our study has several possible limitations. First, because
dietary practices often have large day-to-day variability, esti-
mates based on a single 24-h recall are not fully reliable as a
measure of individuals' usual intake. Nevertheless, we found
large differences for diet in our adjusted models. Second, the
validated and commonly used acculturation measures have no
information on food, music, and childrearing preference,
ethnicity of neighborhoods, and cultural heritage and celebra-
tion. Immigration status itself is a proxy for the acculturation
process. More detailed information related to parental and
children's immigration experiences is needed to better under-
stand the mechanisms for the association among acculturation,
diet, and weight status. These include the timing of arrival,
maternal and paternal acculturation experiences, intergenera-
tional conflict, and family cohesion in parenting. Third, because
of the cross-sectional design, this study cannot address potential
parental cohort effects, i.e., parents who arrived during the same
period may share common characteristics. For example, par-
ents of those adolescents in the second or third generations or
who speak only English might have come to the US earlier than
those in the first generation and those who rarely used English.
Longitudinal studies are necessary to tease out this relationship.
An ideal longitudinal study design might identify Mexican
participants prior to migration (40), allowing baseline assess-
ment of demographics, weight, and lifestyle behaviors and
follow them into the US for up to 5­10 y postmigration, with
annual data collection on weight and lifestyle, including
indicators of acculturation. Finally, we recognize that Hispanics
living in the US are a heterogeneous group. Our findings should
not be directly generalized to other Hispanic immigrant groups,
although adolescents in these groups might experience similar
challenges as Mexican American adolescents.
Successful interventions to address obesity in adolescents that
would be applicable to Mexican American immigrants are
difficult to ascertain. A review of physical activity interventions,
not limited to Hispanic youth, concluded that BMI was not
affected by school-based interventions (41). Our findings on
dietary intake suggest that dietary behaviors are sensitive to
cultural changes that occur with migration, indicating that
dietary interventions may show promise, especially for the
second generation who had high risk of having higher weight
according to our study. Adolescent school-based interventions
targeting diet and activity report modest success with low-
income populations that include Hispanic children (42­44). Our
findings also suggest that policy and programmatic actions
should be in place to assist immigrants to protect traditional
dietary practices such as a high intake of fruit and vegetables and
eating bread while they assimilate to the American culture and
society. Future studies should continue to examine the barriers
that Mexican American adolescents encounter in maintaining
their native diet and identify strategies to address those barriers.
Our findings suggest that Mexican American adolescents in
the United States face challenges in terms of poorer diet and
excessive weight gain associated with this immigration experi-
ence. The American healthy eating and active living environ-
ments might be more "obesogenic" (45,46) than that of the
origin country. To effectively prevent weight gain among
Mexican American adolescents in this obesogenic environment
in the US, either changes to that environment or culturally
appropriate actions to cope with that environment are needed
for this population. It is also warranted to identify and
differentiate the cultural resources and structural factors that
explain how acculturation affects weight status. Considering the
well-established link among poor diet, obesity, and disease, and
the increased risk of adverse health outcomes observed in more
acculturated Hispanics, this work has important implications
for the development of culturally and generationally targeted
nutrition and weight prevention interventions.
