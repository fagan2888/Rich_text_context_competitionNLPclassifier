Objectives: To analyse the variability in health status within as well as between socioeconomic groups.
What is the range of individual variability in the health effects of socioeconomic status? Is the adverse effect
of lower socioeconomic status uniform across the entire distribution of health status?
Design: Nationally representative telephone survey of the US population in 1996.
Setting: 60 US metropolitan and rural areas.
Participants: 47 076 adult respondents to the community tracking study.
Main outcome measures: Self rated physical and mental health status, measured by the Short Form-12
instrument.
Results: There is considerable variability in self rated health within socioeconomic strata and that
variability increases in a step-wise fashion at each lower stratum of income. Most of the increased
variability is accounted for by changes in the middle and lower (10th, 25th, and 50th centiles) rather than
the upper (75th and 90th) portions of the distribution. A resilient subgroup of lower socioeconomic status
people seems to maintain excellent self rated health throughout life, while a more vulnerable lower
socioeconomic status group experiences rapid deterioration in health status as people reach middle age.
Conclusions: Within the population level social structuring of health there are differences in individual
resilience and vulnerability that are amenable to further exploration and potential modification.
There is an inverse gradient between socioeconomic status
(SES) and health across the spectrum of health condi-
tions, including diseases,1 risk factors,1 emotional dis-
tress,2 3 functional status,4 and mortality.527 Despite
improvements in public hygiene and medical care, health
disparities across socioeconomic levels have persisted and
evenwidened.8 Reducing health disparities has risen near the
top of the US public health agenda, as reflected in Healthy
People 2010.9
In the extensive literature on socioeconomic health
disparities, less attention has been paid to examining the
variability in health outcomes within social or economic
groups.10 The approach taken by most studies of SES and
health has been to compare health across levels of SES,
summarising the health experience within each SES stratum
by a single measure, such as mean or rate. This method
permits an overall comparison among SES strata, but
conceals the variability in outcomes within SES groups.
However, understanding the extent of this within group
variability in outcomes--and its sources--is an important
step in tackling health disparities, for two reasons. The first
issue, relevant to public health interventions, is assessing the
range of variation in individual vulnerability to the effects of
adverse socioeconomic conditions. Because of differences in
their genetics, psychosocial circumstances, and other factors,
individuals are likely to differ in their susceptibility to the
adverse effects of the SES gradient. The interaction of these
factors with SES may generate significant differences at both
extremes of susceptibility. A resilient subgroup of disadvan-
taged persons that maintains good health might have
important lessons to teach us about those who have
successfully weathered disadvantage and the factors that
explain their success. Conversely, especially vulnerable
subpopulations that suffer disproportionately from social
stresses may require special interventions. Thus, by focusing
on the heterogeneity within SES groups we can refine our
understanding of how individual factors interact with SES to
produce population outcomes.
The second reason to study heterogeneity in health
outcomes is to further our theoretical models of social
causation. An illustrative example of how understanding
variability can trigger theoretical insights is provided by
research on aging. A robust finding in aging research is that,
within the general pattern of age related declines in physical
functioning, variability in many physiological parameters
increases with age.11 To explain those patterns, current
theoretical explanations posit that aging results from the
accumulation over time of random (``stochastic'') damage to
structural and biochemical mechanisms for maintenance and
repair of physiological systems, eventually resulting in
failures of homeostasis.12 13 The damage derives from both
intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but its random progress means
that a population of aging people becomes more hetero-
geneous over time.
In a parallel way, a coherent theory of social causation
must account not only for observed social gradients but also
for patterns of heterogeneity within those gradients. For
example, suppose that within the known association between
education and overall health status, less educated groups
display less variability in health status than better educated
groups. From a psychosocial theory perspective,14 perhaps the
segregation of low income persons into relatively homo-
geneous adverse environments translates into exposure to a
relatively homogeneous set of psychosocial stressors, leading
to relatively homogenous health outcomes. An alternative
explanation might posit that the higher mortality rate in low
income populations truncates the bottom of their health dis-
tributions in population surveys, thereby reducing observable

heterogeneity. This last hypothesis would also predict that
low income populations' diminished variability would
become more evident in middle aged and older populations,
as the force of differential mortality grew.
On the other hand, suppose the opposite to be true, that
less educated groups display more variability in health status.
Again, psychosocial theory would postulate that greater
variability would emerge from exposure to more hetero-
geneous patterns of psychosocial stress. Another possibility is
that, given a range of individual susceptibility to the effects of
socioeconomic position, individual vulnerability functions as
an ``enabler'' of premature illness in unfavourable environ-
ments. This last scenario would predict that lower SES would
demonstrate a greater effect on lowering the floor of poor
health status outcomes (by sickening vulnerable people) than
on lowering the ceiling of best possible outcomes (because it
is harder to sicken resilient people).
In this study we explore the distribution of a functional
health status measure (the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form­12 (SF-12)) both within and across levels of socio-
economic status in order to understand the range of possible
outcomes associated with position in the SES spectrum. Is
there evidence that certain subpopulations within a given
SES stratum are more resilient or vulnerable than others? Is
the effect of lower SES on health status to lower the ceiling of
best possible outcomes? Or does lower SES pull down the
floor of worst possible outcomes? Or both? And what is the
net effect on overall variability in health status?
METHODS
Data source
This is a secondary analysis of data from the community
tracking study (CTS) that was administered to a stratified
random sample of the US population between July 1996 and
July 1997.15 Respondents completed an automated telephone
survey; provision was made to sample persons without
telephones by providing them with cellular telephones with
which to access the survey. Survey questions covered
demographics, health insurance, satisfaction with health
care, use of health services, and health status. The response
rate was 65%. Responses from persons between the ages of 18
and 74 (n = 47 076) were analysed for this study.
The CTS imputed missing data for certain variables using
sequential hot-deck imputation methods.16 Six per cent of the
health status data and about 1% of the income data used in
this study had been imputed. Complete data were available
for age.
Measures
The health status questions administered included the SF-12
questionnaire,17 a validated health status instrument with
two subscales covering mental and physical health status.
The overall SF-12 score and its subscales are all scaled to have
a mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 10. The Physical
Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental
Component Summary (MCS) subscales are the primary
outcomes examined for this study. The PCS is constructed
from SF-12 items covering physical limitations, role func-
tioning, pain, and general health status. The MCS is
constructed from items on social functioning, role limitations
attributable to emotional problems, and mental health
(psychological distress and psychological wellbeing.
Analysis
The survey population was divided into quintiles of family
income (cut off values: ,$12 000, $12 000­25 000, $25 001­
40 000, $40 001­60 000, and .$60 000) and six age groups
(18­24, 25­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­64, 65­74). For each cell of
the age by income matrix, we then calculated mean SF-12
PCS and MCS scores and the PCS and MCS scores corres-
ponding to the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th centiles of the
health status score distribution for that cell. Twenty four of
the 30 cells had over 1000 respondents; none had less than
400 respondents. All analyses applied person level weights
appropriate to derive estimates for the US population.
We evaluated the variability of physical and mental health
status within income strata in several ways. Firstly, we
created a series of box and whisker plots of the PCS and MCS
centile scores within the age by income cells. The centre line
of each box and whisker plot displays the median score; the
box's lower and upper ends display the 25th and 75th
centiles, respectively; the lower and upper whiskers closest to
the box display the 10th and 90th centiles, respectively; and
the whisker ends display the extreme values of the distribu-
tions (though outliers more than three box lengths from the
edge of the box have been trimmed). Secondly, to quantify
within group variation, we calculated the 90th­10th centile
range, by subtracting the 10th centile score in each cell from
the 90th centile score. As a further measure of within group
variation, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean
within each age by income cell.
We compared the between group variability in physical and
mental health status scores among income strata with two
approaches. To quantify between group variation by income,
we calculated the difference in health status centile scores
between the lowest and highest income quintiles. For
example, the 90th centile score among 18­24 year olds in
the lowest income quintile was subtracted from the 90th
centile score in the highest income quintile. The calculation
was repeated for the 75th, 50th, 25th, and 10th percentiles.
Secondly, a Levene's test18 for equality of variances was used
to evaluate the null hypothesis of equal variances for PCS or
MCS scores across income quintiles.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the sample sizes by age group and income
quintile. The mean SF-12 PCS score for the CTS sample was
50.0 with a standard deviation of 9.9. The mean MCS score
was 52.1 with a standard deviation of 9.6. PCS and MCS
scores displayed only a weak correlation (r = 0.069;
p,0.001).
Key points
N Numerous studies have reported the inverse gradient
between socioeconomic position and health.
N Less work has been done to understand the population
variability in health outcomes within socioeconomic
levels and the extent to which there is resilience or
vulnerability to the adverse effects of lower socio-
economic position.
N Lower income groups exhibit more variability in health
status than higher income groups. This increased
variability stems more from changes in the floor of
the health status distribution than from the ceiling. For
example, the best 25% of health status scores in lower
income quintiles are virtually identical to the best 25%
of scores in high income quintiles, while the middle and
lower segments of the health status distribution are
markedly shifted downwards in lower income persons,
beginning in early adulthood.
N Future research should explore the sources and
implications of this differential vulnerability to the
adverse effects of socioeconomic position.

Figures 1A and 1B display box and whisker plots for the
PCS and MCS scores by age and income quintile. Several
observations can be made from the box plots. Firstly, self
reported physical health status was positively related to
income and generally declined with age, although there was
an upward trend in mean PCS scores in the lowest income
quintiles between ages 55­64 and 65­74. Self reported mental
health status was also positively related to income, but in
contrast with physical health status, generally increased after
age 35.
The second observation is that within group variability in
physical and mental health status increases stepwise as
income level decreases. A measure of this variability, the
range between the 90th and 10th centiles within each age by
income group, is displayed in figures 2A and 2B. Variability in
both physical and mental health status in middle age (ages
35­44 and 45­54) in the lowest income quintile is twice that
in the highest income quintile. Making the same low-high
income comparisons using the standard deviation as an
alternate yardstick for variability yields differences of 63%­
75% in variability in middle age. A Levene's test evaluating
the null hypothesis of no statistical differences among the
five income specific variances within each age interval was
rejected at p,0.001 for both PCS and MCS scores.
The third observation from the box plots is that the greater
overall variability in lower income quintiles stems more from
variability in the lower centiles (floor) of health status scores
than from the upper centiles (ceiling). As elaborated in
figures 3A and 3B--which now focus on between group
variability--substantial differences in the 10th and 25th
centiles of PCS and MCS scores among income quintiles are
already apparent at age 18­24 and these changes are
magnified over the ensuing three decades. In contrast, the
90th and 75th centiles of PCS and MCS scores show little
change among income quintiles. In general, the maximal
differences between the lowest and highest quintiles are
observed in the 45­54 and 55­64 year old age groups and
decrease in the 65­74 year old group.
DISCUSSION
Considerable variability in age specific health status is
evident within SES groups. Although health status is strongly
related to socioeconomic status, a subgroup of lower income
persons of all ages demonstrates high health status scores.
The overall pattern displays a progressive elasticity of the
health status distribution with respect to income: the largest
effect of lower socioeconomic position is in lowering the floor
of worst possible outcomes, while having an intermediate
effect on the middle of the distribution, and only minimal
effect on lowering the ceiling of best possible outcomes. The
effect on the floor of the distribution is large (the 10th centile
of PCS or MCS in the lowest income group being 7­20 points
lower than the highest income group), impairing physical
health status to a degree greater than that observed with
major physical illness. For example, in the medical outcomes
study, the PCS score averaged 8.67 points lower in those with
serious physical illness than in those with minor medical
illness only.17
The degree of variability in health status is itself strongly
related to SES; at each lower level of income, variability
progressively increases. In middle aged persons the range of
health status encompassed by the 90th and 10th centiles in
the poorest quintile was twice that in the most affluent
quintile. The observed patterns are similar for both physical
and mental health status. The income differences in
variability peak in middle age.
Correctly interpreting these findings depends on under-
standing the sources of variability in health outcomes and
particularly why that variability might increase with lower
SES. We propose that a useful conceptual model might be a
``statistical mechanics of health.'' Statistical mechanics is the
branch of physics concerned with deriving the macroscopic
properties of physical systems from the aggregate probabil-
istic behaviour of large numbers of microscopic units such as
atoms and molecules. For example, although the motion of
any individual gas molecule is unpredictable, the law of large
numbers makes the overall distribution of air molecules in a
room very predictable. Applied to social epidemiology,
statistical mechanics can help us model how population
patterns of illness emerge from individual level events.
Although the health trajectory of any individual cannot be
predicted with certainty, large numbers of persons exposed to
gradients of risk-producing social and physical environments
generate the observed social gradients in morbidity and
mortality. Broad population level forces, social, economic,
and cultural, set the parameters of exposure (What kinds of
risks? At what frequency and intensity?) to risk producing
social and physical environments that determine overall
disease prevalence. The contribution of social epidemiology
has largely been to describe the relation between these
adverse social circumstances (for example, neighbourhood
environment, housing, diet, recreation, job control) and
health, with individual SES often serving as a proxy for a
set of socially stratified life circumstances.19
In the statistical mechanics of health, the societal struc-
turing of experience progressively exposes persons at each
lower level of SES to a higher probability of adverse circum-
stances,20 which in turn, through neurobiological21 22 and
other pathways results in premature morbidity and mortality.
But within those macro patterns, there is heterogeneity
within levels of SES that needs explanation, and we will
consider three possible sources of heterogeneity. The first
source possibility is that macro level social structuring could
be, by itself, the major determinant of within SES group
variability in health outcomes. Within any SES stratum,
significant differences in the political, social, cultural, and
economic characteristics of specific areas will produce
heterogeneity in outcomes. A key question, however, given
the empirical results of this study, is whether there is reason
to expect that heterogeneity in social environments should
increase as SES decreases. In fact, there is reason to expect
the opposite. Greater affluence offers choices to live up or

down the scale of living environments, depending on how
people choose to spend their money, whereas lower income
generally can buy entry into only a limited set of living
environments. The source of heterogeneity at lower income
levels is therefore more probably attributable other factors.
The second candidate source of variability is individual
characteristics. Unlike gas molecules, individuals obviously
differ in many important respects, and the variable health
trajectory of any individual at a given level of SES may arise
from individual differences in genetics,23 24 childhood develop-
ment, social support,25 and psychological traits such as sense of
control.26 (The distinction between macro and individual
factors is analogous to Geoffrey Rose's distinction between
the determinants of prevalence and the determinants of

incidence27). These individual susceptibility factors can either
buffer or exacerbate the effect of socioeconomic position, and
we hypothesise that the variability in health status outcomes
therefore emerges from the interaction between socioeco-
nomic standing and these individual level factors.
Socioeconomic position will have greater effect on health
outcomes in susceptible persons.
Presupposing that individual susceptibility factors are
evenly distributed by SES (as seems to be the case for
genetics,28 though highly structured caste societies may prove
an exception; see Bamshad et al29), the interaction between
SES and individual characteristics would be linear; if,
however, some individual susceptibility factors are also
socially structured into a gradient, as other studies demon-
strate,1 30 then a non-linear, multiplicative effect of SES on
health would be evident. The social epidemiology literature
suggests such a non-linear effect.
The third potential source of increased individual level
variability in health within lower socioeconomic groups is a
direct physiological effect suggested by the literature on
aging. Current theories of aging view it as process without a
genetically determined blueprint (because aging occurs after
reproduction and is therefore not subject to selection factors
for reproductive success), but rather attributable to the
cumulative effects over time of randomly occurring damage
to structural and biochemical maintenance systems.12 13 As
these maintenance systems fail, the organism becomes
susceptible to a broad range of physiological insults from
either environmental or internal sources. The observable
signature of failing homeostasis is the robust observation that
variability in many physiological parameters increases with
age.11
The parallels between susceptibility observed in aging
persons and those with lower socioeconomic status are
provocative, including vulnerability to a wide range of
pathophysiologically distinct morbidities and the way in
which lower SES groups tend to resemble higher SES groups
a decade or so older on many health indicators.31 A possible
mechanism linking adverse social circumstances and mor-
bidity is that lower SES persons' higher rate of exposure to
environmental and physiological stresses accelerates and/or
exploits the cumulative stochastic damage of aging.

The strengths of the study are that we analyse a large,
nationally representative sample of the US population, apply
a well validated measure of health status, the SF-12, and
examine a phenomenon that is usually ignored in the health
disparities literature--the variability in health outcomes
within socioeconomic strata.
At least five potential limitations apply to these results.
Firstly, we applied a cross sectional design to the inherently
longitudinal problem of age related declines in health status.
Although recent data demonstrate that within person
changes in population health status measured by the SF-36
are greater than those calculated from cross sectional data,32
we cannot verify from our data that individuals track
consistently at a given centile of the health status distribu-
tion. In fact, we hypothesise that a degree of artefact from the
cross sectional design is observable as the increase in physical
health status between ages 55­64 and 65­74 in the lowest
income quintile. Higher mortality rates among the less
affluent selectively cull out those with worse health status,
leaving a healthier low income group available for sampling.
This hypothesis could be tested with a longitudinal cohort.
Secondly, we used income as our sole stratifying variable
for SES, and income is sensitive to health status, raising the
potential for reverse causation, wherein poor health leads to
low income rather than vice versa. To assess this, we repeated
our analyses using education as the stratifying variable and
the patterns were unchanged.
Thirdly, it is possible that ceiling effects on the SF-12
obscured our ability to detect differences in health status at
the highest reaches of the health status scale. This concern is
lessened by the observation that the 90th centile scores on
the SF-12 PCS and MCS were still 10 points below the
maximum scores in the sample, but the scales may not
adequately differentiate between gradations of excellent
health. Fourthly, we examined only the association between
SES and self rated health--it is possible that other health
outcomes will not demonstrate the same pattern we have
described here. Fifthly, respondents' estimates of their

physical functioning are biased by factors unrelated to their
physical health, such as degree of neuroticism. Perhaps those
who score high on the SF-12 are predisposed to view life
through rose coloured lenses, no matter what their objective
level of functioning.33
In summary, we find that the best 25% of health status
scores in lower income quintiles are virtually identical to the
best 25% of scores in high income quintiles; it is the middle
and lower segments of the health status distribution that are
markedly shifted downwards in lower income persons,
beginning in early adulthood. There seems to be a resilient
subgroup of lower SES people whose self rated health
remains excellent throughout life, while vulnerable persons
of lower SES see a rapid deterioration in health status as they
reach middle age. The findings remind us that within the
``deterministic'' social structuring of health there are differ-
ences in individual resilience and vulnerability that are
amenable to further exploration and potential modification.
Understanding these individual-environment interactions--
the ``ecology'' of social causation--will deepen our under-
standing of social epidemiology.
