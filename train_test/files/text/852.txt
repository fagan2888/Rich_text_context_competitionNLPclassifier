This study examined effects of widowhood and marital harmony on health, health
service use, and health care costs. The Americans Changing Lives data set contains 694
subjects who remained married and 61 subjects who became widowed between 1986
and 1989. Estimated annual mean 1989 health costs, adjusting for 1986 costs, age, sex,
socioeconomic status, mental/physical health, 1989 health insurance, and selection
biases are: $2,384 for widowed, $1,498 for married subjects. Adjusted annual 1989
estimates are: $2,766 for those widowed after harmonious marriages; $2,100 for those
widowed after discordant marriages; $1,790 for spouses in discordant marriages; $1,228
for spouses in harmonious marriages. Harmonious marriages appear protective until
widowhood, after which higher health costs result.

Interactive Effects of Widowhood and
Marital Harmony on Health, Health
Service Use, and Health Care Costs1

Although 800,000 people become widowed each
year (Osterweis, Solomon, & Green, 1984), little is
known about the impact of widowhood on health
service use or health care costs. According to the
U.S. Census, 10,551,000 of the 13,546,000 (78%)
widowed individuals in 1996 were 65 years of age or
over (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1997). Given the
aging of the U.S. population, there will be a continu-
ing growth in the number and proportion of the pop-
ulation that is widowed.
Not only are the numbers of late-life widows and
widowers rising, but elderly Americans are consum-
ing an increasing amount of health care resources. In
1995, per capita health care expenditures for Ameri-
cans over 65 years of age were $7,038--nearly four
times that for people age 65 and under (Agency for
Health Care Policy and Research, 1997). As the eld-
erly population consumes a growing proportion of
national health care expenditures, there will be
mounting interest in determining the factors that con-
tribute to their use of health services. This study ex-
amined the extent to which widowhood, an event
most common in later life, contributes to an increase
in the use of health services, and the costs with
which they are associated.
Because bereavement poses a substantial risk for
mental and physical health impairments, it seems
reasonable to expect that widowhood might result in
increased health service use and health care costs.
The loss of a loved one has been found to heighten
the survivor's vulnerability to depressive symptoms
and episodes of major depression (Bruce, Kim, Leaf,
& Jacobs,1990; Clayton, 1974; Lund, Dimond, & Ca-
serta,1985). Bereavement also has been shown to be
a risk factor for impaired immune function (Bartrop,
Luckhurst, Lazarus, Kiloh, & Penny, 1977; Irwin,
Daniels, & Weiner, 1987; Schleifer, Keller, Cam-
erino, Thornton, & Stein, 1983), neuroendocrine
changes (Irwin et al., 1987; Kim & Jacobs, 1993),
sleep disruptions (McDermott et al., 1997), increased
use of substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and tran-
quilizers (Glass, Prigerson, Kasl, & Mendes de Leon,
1995; Maddison & Viola, 1968; Martin & Dean,
1993), suicidality (Bunch, 1972; Kaprio, Koskenvuo,
& Rita, 1987; MacMahon & Pugh, 1965), and mortal-
ity (Helsing & Szklo, 1981; Schaefer, Quesenberry, &
Wi, 1995; Jagger & Sutton, 1991). Because the grow-
ing number of widows and widowers with compro-
mised health have the potential to place considerable
demands on the health care system, it is important to

evaluate the increase in health costs that might be as-
sociated with widowhood.
In contrast with the wealth of information that has
emerged about the morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with widowhood, surprisingly little is known
about the effects of widowhood on health service uti-
lization and costs, and the limited number of studies
show mixed results. Parkes (1964) found widows to
consult their general practitioner more than three
times as frequently during the 6 months after be-
reavement than they had prior to bereavement. Clay-
ton (1974) and Wolinsky and Johnson (1992), how-
ever, concluded that becoming widowed did not
significantly influence patterns of physician or hospi-
tal utilization. Contrasting rates of health service use
among those bereaved 4 months with national aver-
ages, Mor, McHorney and Sherwood (1986) found
that physician visit rates were somewhat higher but
that hospitalization rates were lower among the be-
reaved in their study than age- and sex-adjusted na-
tional norms. We were unable to locate a single
study that estimated the health costs associated with
widowhood, much less one that prospectively exam-
ined the effects of widowhood on changes in health
care utilization and costs, while adjusting for impor-
tant confounding influences such as age, sex, health
insurance coverage, pre-loss mental and physical
health status, socioeconomic status, and health ser-
vice use.
While marital harmony has consistently demon-
strated positive effects on health and well-being (Bur-
man & Margolin, 1992; Ewart, Burnett, & Taylor,
1983; Goering, Lancee, & Freeman, 1992; Hibbard
& Pope, 1993; Medalie & Goldbourt, 1976; Ren,
1997; Waltz, Badura, Pfaff, & Schott, 1988; Wick-
rama, Conger, & Lorenz, 1995), results of studies that
have examined the influence of marital harmony on
adjustment to widowhood have been inconsistent.
There appear to be two schools of thought concern-
ing the type of relationship to the deceased that
portends the greatest problems with adjustment to
bereavement. Freud (1917/1957), and later Marris
(1958), proposed that ambivalent feelings toward the
deceased would result in a pathological form of grief
that Freud referred to as "obsessive reproaches"--a
form of self-denigration predicated on conflicting
feelings about the deceased. Similarly, Parkes and
Weiss (1983) found that widowed subjects who ret-
rospectively reported a high degree of conflict with
their spouses had considerably higher levels of anxi-
ety, depression, guilt, and yearning than those who
reported less conflict in their marriages.
By contrast, several studies suggest that marriages
with low degrees of conflict and high degrees of close-
ness, consensus, and support are predisposed to
more problematic bereavement reactions. Research
suggests that complicated, or what we now call
"traumatic," grief reactions are most strongly associ-
ated with marriages rated as close, supportive, and
security-increasing (Prigerson et al., 1997b; Priger-
son, Shear, Frank, Silberman, & Reynolds, 1997c;
van Doorn, Kasl, Beery, Jacobs, & Prigerson, 1998).
Because traumatic grief has been shown to predict
mental and physical health impairments as well as
adverse health behaviors (Prigerson et al., 1995a,
1995b, 1996, 1997a, 1999), it seems reasonable to
hypothesize that death in a marriage that was harmo-
nious might result in greater emotional and physical
distress for the surviving spouse, and that this would
translate into an increase in the widowed person's
use of health services. McHorney and Mor (1988)
demonstrated increased health care utilization among
the depressed bereaved (though no differences were
observed in service utilization between depressed
and nondepressed subjects who were not bereaved),
suggesting that the emotional distress associated with
widowhood may play a mediating role in increased
service use. Based on prior studies of traumatic grief,
we would expect that widowed individuals who had
harmonious marriages would be more emotionally
distressed than either people who were not widowed
or those widowed after discordant marriages, and
that this would result in poorer health, and increased
health service use and health costs.
The present study tests this hypothesis using data
from a two-wave, national probability sampling of
community-dwelling respondents--the Americans
Changing Lives (ACL) dataset (House et al., 1990).
The ACL survey provided a dataset that minimized
many of the methodological limitations common to
bereavement research (e.g., inadequate sampling,
low response rates, failure to include a representative
control group, retrospective assessments of pre-loss
information such as quality of the marriage, health
and health service use; Futterman, Gallagher, Thomp-
son, Lovett, & Gilewski, 1990; Gentry & Shulman,
1985; Lopata, 1981; Schlernitzauer, Bierhals, Houck,
Prigerson, & Reynolds, 1998; Stroebe & Stroebe,
1989). The longitudinal design allowed for a pro-
spective study of respondents who lost a spouse
between waves, provided a control group of married
respondents, as well as pre-loss assessments of func-
tioning and the quality of the marriage. Details of the
sample are in the following sections.
Methods
Study Group
Respondents participated in Americans Changing
Lives (ACL), a longitudinal study of productivity and
successful aging in the middle and later years of life.
The ACL surveyed a nationally representative sample
of people over the age of 25 living in the continental
United States. The Survey Research Center of the
University of Michigan conducted a baseline survey
in 1986 and a follow-up survey in 1989. The base-
line response rate yielded a sample of 3,617 respon-
dents who were interviewed in their homes. Three
years later, 2,867 respondents were reinterviewed,
representing 83% of the respondents at baseline who
were still living at the time of the follow-up inter-
view. Blacks and individuals aged 60 or over were
sampled at twice the rate of non-Blacks and persons
351
Vol. 40, No. 3, 2000
under age 60, respectively. Nonresponse did not vary
significantly by age, race, or other known respondent
characteristics (House et al., 1990). Further informa-
tion about the ACL study is provided elsewhere
(House et al., 1990).
The present report focuses only on those who
were married and living with their spouse, who had
not been widowed previously, and who were age 50
years or above at baseline (N  968). Of this group,
755 (78.0%) were retained in the analyses, 183
(18.9%) did not participate in the follow-up interview
[133 (13.7%) were living nonrespondents and 50
(5.2%) had died], 5 (0.5%) had changes in marital
status other than widowhood between waves, and 25
(2.6%) had missing data. Those meeting baseline in-
clusion criteria who did not participate in the follow-
up assessment (n  183) were significantly older,
more likely to be male, and of lower socioeconomic
status than those who were retained in the analyses
(n  755). They also had significantly higher levels of
depressive symptoms, worse functional health, more
chronic conditions, and lower life-satisfaction than
those retained in the analyses. In order to adjust for
these differences between analyzed subjects and
those lost to follow-up, a term that corrected for sam-
ple selection biases was included in each multivari-
ate model, using the procedure that has been de-
scribed by Heckman (1979). (See Analyses section.)
Measures
Marital Harmony.--The ACL contained a "marital
satisfaction and harmony" index composed of items
from scales constructed by Parkes and Weiss (1983)
and Pearlin and Schooler (1978). We modified this
scale to include baseline assessments of the degree of
marital satisfaction, love, and affection; frequency of
thoughts of separation/divorce, disagreements, feel-
ing upset by the marriage; extent of agreement with
statements that they would "feel lost without . . ." and
that "no one could replace" their spouse; frequency
with which the spouse pushed, slapped, or hit the re-
spondent. The refined measure, compared to the
ACL-provided marital quality index, fit better with
contemporary recommendations for such measures
(e.g., Sabatelli, 1988) because it contained "objective
characteristics of adjustment such as . . . absence of
conflict . . . combined with the . . . degree of satisfac-
tion with the relationship . . ." (Sabatelli, 1988; 894).
Internal consistency (Cronbach's ) for the refined
marital harmony measure was 0.67. A median-split
of the baseline score for marital harmony was used to
divide respondents into a marital harmony group (n 
366) and a marital discord group (n  389). The
statistical power afforded by a median-split was ad-
vantageous for analyses that examined the effects of a
Marital Harmony  Widowhood status interaction
term. It is worth noting that analyses employing a
continuous measure of marital harmony produced
similar effects on health costs to analyses employing
the marital harmonyÂ­marital discord dichotomy, as
will be reported below. We chose to present the re-
sults for the dichotomous measure of marital quality
rather than the continuous measure because they ap-
pear easier to interpret.
Health Service Utilization.--The ACL contained
self-reported assessments of the number of nights
spent in a hospital in the past 6 months, the number
of days spent in a nursing home over the past 6
months, the number of visits to a medical doctor, and
the number of visits to a psychiatrist over the past 3
months. Visits to a physician were doubled to reflect
use for a period consistent with that specified for the
number of nights spent in a hospital (i.e., 6 months).
"Outpatient" services refer to psychiatrist and other
medical visits; "inpatient" services refer to the num-
ber of days spent in a hospital and nursing home.
Health Costs.--Health care costs were estimated
by multiplying the number of units of each service
used by the estimated unit costs for each type of ser-
vice. Unit costs for 1989 were derived from national
data in the Statistical Abstracts of the U.S. (U.S. Bu-
reau of the Census, 1991). Based on these data, we
assigned $767 as the cost of a night spent in the hos-
pital, $100 as the cost for a day spent in a nursing
home, $130 as the cost for a visit to a physician, and
$97 for the cost of a visit to a psychiatrist. Total costs
were the summation of the costs for each self-
reported psychiatrist visit, other medical doctor visit,
nursing home day, and hospital night up to a maxi-
mum of 8 nights. The costs associated with hospital
stays were limited to 8 nights in order to eliminate
the influence of extreme outlying values on estimates
of mean inpatient costs. Only 19 of 694 (2.7%) of the
group who remained married and 2 of 61 (3.3%) of
the group who became widowed had hospital stays
of 8 or more nights at follow-up (2  0.1, df  1, NS).
Control Variables.--Age, sex, socioeconomic sta-
tus, life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of
chronic conditions, functional health status, health
service use and costs at baseline, and follow-up
health insurance coverage were included as control
variables because they were significantly associated
with widowhood, marital harmony, and/or follow-up
health service use/costs. We describe briefly the con-
trol variables that require definition.
Using information obtained on levels of income
and education, the ACL provided a 4-category mea-
sure of socioeconomic status (SES): low, lower-mid-
dle, upper-middle, and high SES. When used as a
control variable, the SES measure was dichotomized
to reflect whether or not the respondent was of low
SES. The dichotomous measure was deemed more
desirable because nearly one half of those who be-
came widowed (30 of 61) fell into the low SES group,
and only a few (3 of 61) fell into the high SES group.
Thus, the modified low versus not low SES measure
yielded a more even distribution across SES catego-
ries. Life-satisfaction was assessed using an index
comprising 4 Likert-scaled items that asked respon-
352 The Gerontologist
dents the extent to which they agreed with statements
about their happiness, satisfaction, and lack of re-
grets. Higher scores on this standardized index corre-
spond to lower levels of life-satisfaction. An 11-item
short form of the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to
assess severity of depressive symptoms. The short
form, developed by Kohut, Berkman, Evans, and Cor-
noni-Huntley (1993), had sound psychometric prop-
erties (e.g., Cronbach's  = .81). Standardized scores
were provided. The number of major chronic condi-
tions experienced in the last year included the num-
ber of the following 10 chronic conditions endorsed
by the respondent: arthritis/rheumatism, lung disease,
hypertension, heart attack or heart trouble, diabetes,
cancer/malignant tumor, foot problems, stroke, frac-
tures or broken bones, and urinary incontinence. An
index of functional health status was used to rate re-
spondents on a scale ranging from a score of 1, indi-
cating confinement to a bed or chair, to a score of 4,
indicating ability to do heavy housework without dif-
ficulty. Health insurance coverage at the 1989 as-
sessment was determined by an affirmative response
to a question asking whether or not the respondent
had health insurance at that time.
Analyses
First, between-group t tests for continuous mea-
sures and 2 statistics for categorical measures were
used to test for significant differences in baseline
characteristics between married respondents and
those who would become widowed. We then con-
ducted a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
to estimate the main effect of widowhood on health
status and health service use at follow-up. The AN-
COVAs that estimated the effects of widowhood on
1989 health status adjusted for age, sex, SES, life-sat-
isfaction, depressive symptoms, number of chronic
conditions, functional health status at baseline, fol-
low-up health insurance coverage, and a term that
corrected for sample selection biases using a tech-
nique proposed by Heckman (1979). The ANCOVAs
estimating the effect of widowhood on health service
use in 1989 adjusted for age, sex, SES, life-satisfac-
tion, depressive symptoms, number of chronic condi-
tions, functional health status, and health service use
at baseline, follow-up health insurance coverage,
and sample selection biases.
Next, we conducted a one-way ANCOVA to esti-
mate the main effects of becoming widowed versus
remaining married, and the main effects of marital
harmony versus marital discord, on 1989 health
costs. These ANCOVAs adjusted for age, sex, SES,
life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of
chronic conditions, functional health status, and
health care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-
ance coverage, and sample selection biases.
We then entered the interaction between marital
harmony and widowhood status into the ANCOVA
for 1989 health costs, adjusting for the main effects
of widowhood and marital harmony, age, sex, SES,
life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of
chronic conditions, functional health status, and
health care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-
ance coverage, and sample selection biases.
Results
Baseline Group Differences
In Table 1, baseline characteristics of the subse-
quently widowed group were compared with those
of the group that were to remain married. Despite the
restriction of the sample to only respondents who
were age 50 years or above, the widowed group still
emerged as significantly older than the married
group. Respondents who became widowed were also
more likely to be women, of lower SES at baseline,
and less likely to have health insurance coverage at
follow-up than respondents who remained married
through both baseline and follow-up assessments.
The Effects of Widowhood and Marital Harmony at
Follow-up
With respect to health status, the mean level of de-
pressive symptoms, number of chronic conditions,
and functional disability at follow-up all reflected
greater impairment for the widowed group compared
to the married group, controlling for age, sex, SES,
life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of
chronic conditions, functional health status at base-
line, follow-up health insurance coverage, and a term
that corrected for sample selection biases (Table 2).
With respect to health service use, the average
number of physician visits and days spent in a nurs-
ing home at follow-up were significantly higher for
the widowed group compared to the married group,
adjusting for all of the control variables just men-
tioned and health service use at baseline (see Table
2). However, the widowed group did not have signif-
icantly more visits to a psychiatrist or nights spent in
a hospital than did the married group at follow-up.
With respect to the effects of widowhood status on
health costs at follow-up (Table 3), the means for to-
tal health costs in 1989 were significantly higher for
respondents who became widowed between the
1986 and 1989 assessments than for those who re-
mained married during that interval (estimated annu-
ally: $2,384 vs $1,498, respectively; F  4.72, df 
1,742, p  .03), adjusting for the full set of control
variables mentioned above, but substituting baseline
health care costs for baseline health service use. The
widowed group had significantly higher adjusted
mean outpatient (i.e., psychiatric and other medical
visit) costs than those who remained married (esti-
mated annually: $1,156 vs $748, respectively; F 
5.73, df  1,742, p  .02). Although the annual ad-
justed mean inpatient costs at follow-up were 1.6
times higher for the widowed respondents than they
were for the married respondents, the difference in
inpatient costs between these two groups did not
reach a level of statistical significance (estimated an-
nually: $1,222 vs $744, respectively; F  1.85, df 
1,742, NS).
353
Vol. 40, No. 3, 2000
As for the direct effects of marital harmony on fol-
low-up health costs (Table 3), the adjusted mean total
costs were significantly lower for respondents with
high marital harmony, controlling for age, sex, SES,
life-satisfaction, depressive symptoms, number of
chronic conditions, functional health status, and
health care costs at baseline, follow-up health insur-
ance coverage, and sample selection biases (esti-
mated annually: $1,714 vs $2,168, respectively; F 
3.78, df  1,742; p  .05). More specifically, outpa-
tient costs were significantly lower for respondents
who scored high on marital harmony than they were
for those who scored low. In models that replaced
the marital harmony dummy variable with the con-
tinuous measure of marital harmony, a significant
positive effect of marital harmony on outpatient costs
was also found (F  4.43; df  1,742; p  .04). Inpa-
tient costs, however, were not significantly lower for
respondents who had harmonious marriages. Consis-
tent with these results, in models that substituted a

results also revealed no significant influence of mari-
tal harmony on inpatient costs.
Interactive Effects of Widowhood and Marital
Harmony on Health Care Costs
We then compared the means for health costs in
1989 among the four groups resulting from the inter-
action between the dichotomous marital status (mar-
ried/became widowed) and marital quality (harmony/
discord) variables, adjusting for the main effects of
marital status and marital quality, and the full set of
control variables (Table 4). In contrast with the signif-
icantly lower total health care costs in 1989 associ-
ated with having a harmonious marriage versus a dis-
cordant marriage (Table 3), respondents who became
widowed in the context of a harmonious marriage
had the highest average total costs in 1989 (annual
estimate: $2,766). Their total adjusted mean health
costs in 1989 were 32% higher than those for wid-
owed respondents who had discordant marriages
(annual estimate: $2,100).
Respondents with harmonious marriages who be-
came widowed had the highest average adjusted out-
patient costs in 1989 (annual estimate: $1,390). These
costs were 42% higher than the outpatient costs among
those widowed in the context of a discordant mar-
riage (annual estimate: $978). Although the average
health costs for inpatient care were highest among re-
spondents widowed following a harmonious marriage,
the differences in inpatient costs between the marital
statusÂ­marital harmony groups did not reach a level
of statistical significance.
Discussion
The aging of the U.S. population has made wid-
owhood an increasingly common part of American
life. Given a heightened interest in containing health
costs in recent years, there is a need to evaluate the
extent to which the growing numbers of widows and
widowers will experience health impairments, in-
creased health service use, and health care costs.
Likewise, there is a need to determine the factors that
may moderate the influence of widowhood on health
and expenditures for health care. The results of this
study indicate that widowhood is associated with a
substantial increase in health care costs. Further-
more, while marital harmony appears to be protec-
tive of health and to be associated with lower health

care costs among married respondents, the reverse
appears to be true among widowed respondents.
Widowed subjects who reported their marriage as
harmonious have the highest health care costs com-
pared to all of the other analyzed groups.
Before discussing the results in greater detail, sev-
eral methodological limitations of this study deserve
mention. First, a relatively small number of respon-
dents were widowed between the baseline and fol-
low-up assessments (n  61), indicating a need to
replicate the results found in this study in datasets
that contain a larger sample of widows and widow-
ers. The limited number of widowers, in particular,
made it difficult to stratify by sex, although sex was
entered as a control variable in each of the multivari-
ate models. The size of the widowed sample also in-
hibited our ability to divide the sample into more
narrowly defined age groups (e.g., the oldest-old,
middle-old, youngest-old). In an attempt to adjust for
the age bias in the effects of widowhood on health,
we included only respondents age 50 years and
above, and controlled for age by including it as a
model covariate. The limited number of widowed re-
spondents also made it difficult to compare the
health costs of widowed persons in lower socioeco-
nomic strata with those in upper socioeconomic
strata, although baseline (the only time SES was as-
sessed) low SES, follow-up health insurance cover-
age, and the sample selection correction allowed us
to adjust our estimates for financial disincentives that
might influence health costs for widowed versus mar-
ried respondents.
In addition, the available data did not allow for an
examination or comparison of health outcomes be-
tween recently widowed respondents and respon-
dents who had been widowed for longer periods of
time. Because only 4 of the 61 widowed subjects
were widowed within 3 months of the follow-up as-
sessment, we could not reliably estimate or compare
more immediate with longer term effects of widow-
hood on health. We did examine the 15 subjects
who reported being widowed in the 3 months prior
to the baseline assessment with 607 others who were
widowed longer than that duration at baseline. The
6-month mean total health costs, adjusted for age,
sex, and SES, were $1,652 among the recently wid-
owed group compared with $946 among those wid-
owed longer than 3 months at baseline (this differ-
ence was not statistically significant, probably due to
a lack of statistical power). These results suggest that,
compared to those widowed longer than 3 months,
health costs were higher at baseline for the more re-
cently widowed.
Despite the fact that over 90% of the widowed re-
spondents in this study were widowed beyond the
time of greatest health risk (i.e., the first few months
post-loss), we still find large effects of widowhood on
health and health costs among persons widowed any
time within a 3-year period. Furthermore, these ef-
fects of widowhood remain even after adjusting for a
comprehensive set of confounding influences. Sev-
eral studies (Parkes, 1964; Prigerson et al., 1997a;
Zisook, Shuchter, & Lyons, 1987) suggest that the
negative impact of widowhood on health is greatest
in the first 6 months post-loss. Consequently, if we
had compared a group of married respondents with a
group of widowed respondents who had all been
widowed 6 months or less, we might expect to find
even greater discrepancies between these groups
with respect to health impairments, health service
use, and health care costs. Additionally, while the in-
clusion of the Heckman sample selection correction
adjusted for the loss of many of the sickest subjects to
follow-up, the actual health costs accrued by sub-
jects who died between waves were not included in
the cost estimates. Given that the last year of life is
the most expensive, with 25%Â­35% of Medicare ex-
penditures going to enrollees who will die in that
year (Lubitz & Prihoda, 1984), omitting these costs
implies that costs probably would have been consid-
erably higher had we been able to account for the
services used by widowed subjects who themselves
died between baseline and follow-up.
Another limitation was that the health costs were a
direct function of the units of services used (i.e., costs 
quantity of services used  the average unit cost of
that service). Although it would have been preferable
to use the actual costs of health services each respon-
dent had used, information on individual costs was
not available. Nevertheless, we believe the value of
monetizing service use is that it provides a more intu-
itive understanding of the magnitude of the group dif-
ferences and the public health consequences associ-
ated with widowhood. Because it is not reasonable to
combine inpatient and outpatient units of service,
dollar figures also provide a uniform metric for pre-
senting costs of total service use.
Another limitation is that the assessments of health
service utilization were based on self-report data
rather than administrative data that document actual
service use. Studies suggest, however, that self-report
utilization data are reasonably accurate; if anything,
the tendency is for respondents to underreport ser-
vice use (Brown & Adams, 1992; National Center for
Health Statistics, 1965). For example, the National
Health Interview Survey (National Center for Health
Statistics, 1965) found the underreporting of informa-
tion about hospitalizations to be less than 10%. The
health cost estimates are also conservative because
they do not include the expense of medications, fees
for laboratory and other diagnostic services, disability
days, transportation, and the like.
In spite of the overall conservative nature of the
cost estimates, the costs found to be associated with
widowhood were sizable. If we multiply the differ-
ence in annual adjusted mean total health costs
found between the widowed group and the married
group (adjusted annual estimated difference: $886)
by the 800,000 newly widowed individuals in the
United States each year, the annual difference be-
tween these two groups would be $708,800,000 in
1989 dollars, or nearly $1 billion in 2000 dollars.
With the rising number of widowed persons, a more
complete accounting of health costs, growing rates of
356 The Gerontologist
health insurance coverage [particularly in light of the
Surgeon General's recommendation for expanded
coverage for mental health care (Pear, 1999)], and
rapidly rising health costs, the health expenses asso-
ciated with widowhood are likely to be markedly
higher in years to come.
Effects of Widowhood on Health Service Use and Costs
The results of this study demonstrate that widowed
respondents have a greater number of physician visits
and days spent in a nursing home than do married re-
spondents. Despite the higher levels of depressive
symptoms among the widowed group, widowed sub-
jects were not significantly more likely to visit a psy-
chiatrist or other mental health professional compared
to nonwidowed subjects at follow-up. Widowhood
appeared to have no significant influence on the
number of days spent in a hospital.
With respect to health costs, the widowed group
had significantly higher mean total costs than did the
married group. This result appears to be a function of
increases in physician visits rather than an increase in
hospital lengths of stay. Although no comparative fig-
ures exist for health care costs associated with wid-
owhood, prior studies have examined the influence
of widowhood on health service use. Our results are
consistent with studies that have found widowhood
to be associated with increased use of physician visits
(Parkes, 1964; Mor et al., 1986), and the absence of a
"widowhood" effect on hospital use (Clayton, 1974;
Mor et al., 1986; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992). The re-
sults of this study, together with prior research, indi-
cate that widowed individuals, at least within 3 years
following the spouse's death, are likely to have
higher health costs relative to married individuals,
primarily because of their greater number of physi-
cian visits.
Effects of Marital Quality on the Impact of Widowhood
Although a number of studies document the health
benefits of a satisfying, nonconflictive marriage (Bur-
man & Margolin, 1992; Ewart et al., 1983; Goering et
al., 1992; Hibbard & Pope, 1993; Medalie & Gold-
bourt, 1976; Ren, 1997; Waltz et al., 1988; Wick-
rama et al., 1995), little is known about the effects of
marital quality on health service utilization and
health costs. The results of this study appear to con-
firm these prior reports by extending them to demon-
strate the lower costs for physician visits associated
with marital harmony in contrast to marital discord.
Furthermore, because we controlled for potentially
confounding influences such as severity of depressive
symptoms and life-satisfaction (social support was
not found to have a significant confounding effect),
the influence of marital discord on higher physician
costs cannot be attributed to these other factors. Sim-
ilar to the effects of widowhood, marital harmony did
not significantly influence inpatient costs.
When the effects of marital harmony are examined
in interaction with the effects of widowhood, we find
that the quality of the relationship to the deceased
significantly influences the health costs of the surviv-
ing partner. Counter to those who have claimed that
widowed individuals who had conflictive marriages
are more adversely affected by the loss (Freud,
1917/1957; Marris, 1958; Parkes & Weiss, 1983), our
results suggest that widowed individuals who had
harmonious marriages are the group with the poorest
health, and that this translates into increased health
service utilization and health costs. These findings
concur with studies by Futterman and colleagues
(1990) and Vachon and colleagues (1982), that sug-
gest that individuals with good marital quality exhibit
greater dysfunction when they become widowed.
They are also in agreement with our studies of trau-
matic grief in which we have found marriages high in
marital quality to be associated with more severe
traumatic grief symptomatology (Prigerson et al.,
1997c; vanDoorn et al., 1998) which, in turn, has
been proven to be predictive of subsequent decline
in health as well as adverse health behaviors (Priger-
son et al., 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 1997b, 1999). Thus,
prior work demonstrating the connection between
positive marital quality and greater severity of trau-
matic grief symptoms suggests that the influence of
marital harmony on health, health service utilization,
and health care costs may be mediated through
symptoms of pathological, or complicated, grief. Be-
cause the ACL survey did not contain specific assess-
ments of traumatic grief symptomatology, we were
unable to test this hypothesis explicitly. Future re-
search is needed to test whether traumatic grief
symptomatology mediates the relationship between
being widowed after a harmonious marriage and
poor health. To the extent we are able to identify
and, ultimately, modify the effects that loss of a con-
genial marriage has on health (e.g., by ameliorating
traumatic grief symptoms), we may be able to reduce
the health costs associated with widowhood. Effica-
cious interventions would assist in reducing the bur-
den of spousal loss both for the individual survivor
and for society as a whole through the reduction of
demand on an already strained health care system.
