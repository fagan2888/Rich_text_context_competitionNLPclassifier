ABSTRACT
Whether the creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thresholds used to define chronic kidney
disease (CKD) identify metabolic abnormalities similarly in minority and nonminority populations is
unknown. We addressed this question among adult participants in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (n  15,837). GFR was estimated from serum creatinine
values and metabolic abnormalities were defined by 5th or 95th percentile values. After adjustment for
age, demographic characteristics, and GFR, black participants were significantly more likely than white
participants to have abnormal levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, phosphorus,
and uric acid. Hispanic subjects were significantly more likely to have abnormal levels of systolic blood
pressure, hemoglobin, bicarbonate, and phosphorus. Among participants with GFR  60 mL/min per
1.73 m2, black participants were significantly more likely to have abnormal levels of systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, hemoglobin, and uric acid; Hispanic subjects were significantly more likely to have
abnormal systolic blood pressure levels. Metabolic abnormalities were more common in minority
populations, and low GFR appeared to have a multiplicative effect. Defining CKD using a single GFR
threshold may be disadvantageous for minority populations because metabolic abnormalities are
present at higher levels of GFR.

Estimates indicate that approximately 19 million
adults in the United States have chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD),1 and recent public health initiatives
have focused on harmonizing case definitions and
early identification in the general population.2­4
Several community-based studies have shown a
graded association between GFR and the risk for
cardiovascular disease and death, providing further
support for the hypothesis that earlier detection of
CKD leads to public health improvement.1,5­9 Risk
factors for CKD include older age, hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and family history
of CKD.
Several national guidelines have recommended
the use of serum creatinine levels to measure GFR,
with 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 considered a watershed
value, in part because treatable renal abnormalities
become increasingly prevalent as GFR falls below
this level.2,10­12 At the level of public health policy,
demonstrating a GFR value below this threshold
before embarking on an exhaustive search for renal
complications would seem to be a rational use of
these guidelines. Surprisingly, it is unknown
whether such a two-stage strategy performs simi-
larly in minority and nonminority populations. In
particular, if GFR thresholds are to become the
gatekeeper to more intensive investigation and in-
tervention, then it would seem important to know
whether renal abnormalities develop at similar GFR
values among individuals of different races and eth-
nicities. Hence, the objectives of this national study

were to test the following hypotheses among the adult popula-
tion of the United States:
1. Overall prevalence of metabolic abnormalities varies by
race/ethnicity.
2. Prevalence of metabolic abnormalities varies by race/
ethnicity, independent of GFR level.
3. Prevalence of renal abnormalities varies by race/ethnicity
among individuals with GFR 60 ml per min per 1.73 m2.
RESULTS
Of the 15,837 study participants, 76.9% were white, 10.4%
were black, 5.1% were Hispanic, and 7.6% were of other race or
ethnicity (Table 1). The corresponding mean GFR values were
90.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for white individuals, 104.7 for black
individuals, 108.5 for Hispanic individuals, and 99.8 for others
(P  0.0001).
Table 2 shows comparisons of mean values of metabolic
and BP variables, by race and ethnicity, in the overall popula-
tion and in the subgroups defined by GFR category. In the
overall population, participants with GFR 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 had higher systolic BP (SBP), potassium, phosphorus,
and uric acid levels and lower hemoglobin levels than partici-
pants with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Compared with
white individuals, black individuals had higher SBP, diastolic
BP (DBP), phosphorus, and uric acid levels and lower potas-
sium and hemoglobin levels; Hispanic individuals had higher
phosphorus and lower SBP, DBP, and potassium levels. For-
mal testing showed statistically significant interactions be-
tween race and ethnicity and GFR for SBP, DBP, and uric acid.
Among individuals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, black
individuals had higher SBP, DBP, and uric acid levels and lower
hemoglobin levels; Hispanic individuals had higher SBP and
phosphorus levels and lower bicarbonate and calcium levels.
Table 3 is similar to Table 2, with adjustment for the char-
acteristics shown in Table 1. In the overall population, individ-
uals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 had higher SBP, DBP,
potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and uric acid levels and
lower hemoglobin and bicarbonate levels than individuals with
GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Compared with white individ-
uals, black individuals had higher SBP, DBP, and phosphorus
levels and lower potassium and hemoglobin levels; Hispanic
individuals had higher SBP and phosphorus levels and lower
potassium and hemoglobin levels. Formal testing showed a
statistically significant interaction between race and ethnicity
and GFR for DBP, bicarbonate, and uric acid. Among individ-
uals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, black individuals had
higher SBP, DBP, and uric acid levels and lower hemoglobin
levels; Hispanic individuals had higher SBP levels and lower
hemoglobin levels.
Table 4 shows unadjusted odds risk for laboratory and BP
variables 5th or 95th percentiles. In the overall population,
individuals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were more
likely to have abnormal levels of each variable studied except
calcium. Black individuals were more likely to have abnormal
levels of each variable except high potassium and low calcium,
and Hispanic individuals were more likely to have abnormal
levels of bicarbonate, phosphorus, and uric acid. Formal test-
ing showed a statistically significant interaction between race
and ethnicity and GFR for abnormal levels of SBP, DBP, potas-
sium, and uric acid. Among individuals with GFR 60 ml/min

per 1.73 m2, black individuals were more likely to have abnormal
SBP, DBP, hemoglobin, and uric acid levels; Hispanic individuals
were more likely to have abnormal SBP, DBP, bicarbonate, cal-
cium, and phosphorus levels.
With covariate adjustment (Table 5), individuals with GFR
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were more likely to have abnormal
levels of each variable studied except SBP, DBP, and calcium.
Black individuals were more likely to have abnormal SBP,
DBP, hemoglobin, and phosphorus levels, and Hispanic indi-
viduals were more likely to have abnormal SBP, hemoglobin,
bicarbonate, and phosphorus levels. Formal testing showed
statistically significant interactions between race and ethnicity
and GFR for abnormal levels of SBP, DBP, potassium, and uric
acid. Among individuals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
black individuals were more likely to have abnormal SBP, DBP,
hemoglobin, and uric acid levels; Hispanic individuals were
more likely to have abnormal SBP levels.
Among individuals with GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
adjusted odds ratios (OR) for abnormal levels of several vari-
ables were higher among participants from minority popula-
tions. Figure 1 shows adjusted OR of detecting these abnormal-
ities when different GFR thresholds (in 5-ml/min per 1.73 m2
increments) were used for case definition among black, His-
panic, and other-race participants, using a fixed threshold
value of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for white participants. With
this approach, none of the GFR thresholds led to statistical
neutrality for abnormal SBP, DBP, or hemoglobin levels. Statisti-
cal neutrality was achieved with GFR thresholds of 65, 80, and 65
ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively, for phosphorus, uric acid, and
the presence of one or more abnormalities among black, His-
panic, and other-race participants.

black and Hispanic adults than in white adults, an association
that was evident regardless of whether CKD was present. As
expected, the presence of CKD seemed to multiply prevalence
estimates, irrespective of race. In aggregate, these observations
seem to suggest that CKD management strategies based on
single GFR thresholds may be disadvantageous to populations
in which these complications are more prevalent, namely eth-
nic and racial minorities. In particular, the findings suggest
that GFR thresholds 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may be appro-
priate for detecting several metabolic abnormalities in minor-
ity populations.
It was been known for several years that the burden of ESRD
(requiring renal replacement therapy) differs substantially in
different racial and ethnic groups in the United States, with
much higher event rates among black individuals.13­17
Progress has been made in the arena of CKD, especially with
regard to interventions that slow the progression of important
causes, such as diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive ne-
phrosclerosis.18,19
We found that black individuals have a lower prevalence of
GFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, mirroring recent findings of the
Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (RE-
GARDS) study.20 People of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity now
form the largest single minority population in the United
States,21 and there is little reason to suspect that they should
have intrinsically lower risk for kidney disease; unfortunately,
very few studies have attempted to quantify the burden of CKD
in this population.
We found that, unlike several other variables, mean potas-
sium levels were lower in black individuals, when adjustment
was made for GFR. A substantial body of evidence suggests that
black individuals may be relatively potassium deficient com-
pared with white individuals. For example, urinary potassium
excretion seems to be lower on random diets22­25 and on diets

tionship between potassium deficiency and sodium retention,
intrinsic differences in potassium handling may contribute to
higher-than-expected prevalence of hypertension among
black individuals.28
Formal, gold-standard measurement of GFR was not a de-
sign feature of the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III). Therefore, it was not possible to
determine whether associations between serum creatinine and
true GFR values differ in community-dwelling adults of differ-
ent races and ethnicities and similar age and gender distribu-
tion. Similarly, it was not possible to determine whether com-
plications associated with declining GFR develop at different
GFR levels or whether the higher prevalence of GFR-associated
complications in minority groups with GFR 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 reflects a greater prevalence of these complications in
general, irrespective of GFR level. The data presented here tend
to support the latter hypothesis. For example, in this study,
compared with white participants, black participants had
higher adjusted OR for high BP and low hemoglobin levels,
regardless of whether GFR levels were 60 ml/min per 1.73
m2. For Hispanic participants, similar between-GFR category
parallels were seen for high BP, low hemoglobin, and high
phosphorus.
The limitations of our study should be pointed out. It was
cross-sectional, and longitudinal measures were not available.
Mirroring clinical reality, gold-standard measures of GFR,
such as those based on inulin or isotope clearance methods,
were not used. Limitations notwithstanding, we believe that
this study has useful features. The study design facilitates quan-
tification of the burden and the complications of CKD in a
nationally representative sample. Overall, this study suggests

that strategies in which detection of treatable renal abnormal-
ities are predicated on a single threshold of estimated GFR
might be disadvantageous to racial minorities. Research focus-
ing on efficient, equitable identification of covert kidney dis-
ease is urgently needed.
CONCISE METHODS
Design
NHANES III, conducted between 1988 and 1994, used stratified, mul-
tistage, probability sampling methods to assemble a nationwide prob-
ability sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United
States.29 Calibration factors can have an impact on creatinine-based
estimates of glomerular filtration, and NHANES III data have been
directly calibrated with reference standards. All NHANES III partici-
pants aged 20 yr or older were eligible for determination of hemato-
logic and biochemical profiles at the mobile examination center.
Measurements and Definitions
GFR.
Serum creatinine, measured at White Sands Research Center (Alam-
ogordo, NM) with the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction and a Hitachi
737 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), was recali-
brated to results obtained at the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH),
using the method of Coresh et al.30 Estimated GFR levels were derived
from the re-expressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
Study formula, namely, 175  (serum creatinine value)1.154 
age0.203  (0.742 for women)  (1.21 if black).12

Metabolic Abnormalities.
These were defined by the fifth or 95th percentiles of their respective
distributions in the overall population. The specific threshold values
were as follows: SBP 156.0 or DBP 90.7 mmHg, potassium 4.6
mmol/L, hemoglobin 118 g/L, bicarbonate 22.2 mmol/L, calcium
2.13 mmol/L, phosphorus 1.36 mmol/L, and uric acid 0.47
mmol/L.
Other Variables.
Self-reported diabetes was defined as an affirmative answer to the
question, "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes
or sugar diabetes?" Self-reported hypertension was defined as an af-
firmative answer to the question, "Have you ever been told by a doctor
or other health professional that you have hypertension, also called
high BP?"
Statistical Analyses
2 analysis and ANOVA were used for unadjusted comparisons of
baseline variables between racial/ethnic groups. Considered as con-
tinuous parameters, unadjusted and adjusted associations of meta-
bolic and BP variables were explored with ANOVA and multiple lin-
ear regression, respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic
regression analyses were used to explore the corresponding associa-
tions when abnormal values of metabolic and BP variables were con-
sidered as binary (yes/no) variables. National estimates of each pa-
rameter were adjusted for the sampling weights implicit in complex
survey designs, using SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) for complex sample surveys. SAS Ver-
sion 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for data assembly.
