OBJECTIVE -- To assess the prevalence of diabetes, distinguishing between elderly individ-
uals with diabetes diagnosed in middle age ("middle age­onset diabetes") from elderly individ-
uals with recently diagnosed diabetes ("elderly onset diabetes") and to assess the burden of
complications and control of cardiovascular risk factors in these groups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from 2,809 elderly indi-
viduals from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-
sectional nationally representative survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the
U.S.
RESULTS -- Among adults aged 65 years, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was
15.3%, representing 5.4 million individuals in the U.S. The prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes was 6.9% or 2.4 million individuals. Elderly individuals with middle age­onset
diabetes had a much greater burden of microvascular disease but have a similar burden of
macrovascular disease compared with individuals with elderly onset diabetes. Elderly indi-
viduals with middle age­onset diabetes had substantially worse glycemic control (propor-
tion of individuals with HbA1c
7%  59.9%) compared with either elderly onset (41.6%)
or nonelderly individuals with diabetes (55.3%). Individuals with elderly onset diabetes
were also less likely to be taking glucose-lowering medications.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this study, we documented a high prevalence of diabetes among
elderly individuals and high rate of poor glycemic control in this population. Individuals with
middle age­ and elderly onset diabetes appear to represent distinct groups with differing burdens
of disease and possibly differing treatment goals. Future studies of diabetes in elderly individuals
may need to consider stratification based on age of diagnosis.
Diabetes Care 29:2415­2419, 2006
The number of individuals aged 65
years in the U.S. is increasing mark-
edly. People aged 65 years repre-
sented 12% of the U.S. population in
2000 (35 million people), and this pro-
portion is expected to grow to almost 20%
by the year 2020 (55 million people)
(1). The aging U.S. population poses great
challenges to the health care system and
clinical practice. Diabetes and its related
problems of obesity, insulin resistance,
and impaired glucose tolerance are grow-
ing problems in the U.S. The cumulative
lifetime incidence of diabetes is estimated
to be 30% (2). Age is a known risk fac-
tor for diabetes, but the epidemiology of
the disease among elderly individuals has
not been adequately characterized.
The objective of this study was to as-
sess the prevalence of diabetes, distin-
guishing between elderly individuals with
diabetes diagnosed in middle age ("mid-
dle age­onset diabetes") from elderly
individuals with recently diagnosed dia-
betes ("elderly onset diabetes"). We hy-
pothesized that the burden of micro- and
macrovascular disease and treatment of
diabetes would differ between these two
groups. A secondary aim of this study was
to investigate whether management of
cardiovascular risk factors also differed
between these groups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- This study was based
on data from the 1999­2002 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), an ongoing cross-sectional
survey of the civilian, noninstitutional-
ized population of the U.S. Detailed
in-person interviews, physical examina-
tions, and serum samples were obtained
from 21,000 individuals in the 1999­
2002 survey. The eligible study sample
consisted of 3,765 individuals aged
40­64 years and 2,809 individuals aged
65 years who were not missing informa-
tion on diabetes status.
Assessment of diabetes
The NHANES standardized health exam-
inations in the mobile examination cen-
ters (MEC) included measurement of
height, weight, and blood pressure and
collection of blood samples by trained
personnel. Diagnosed diabetes was de-
fined as a self-reported physician diagno-
sis. Individuals reporting "borderline dia-
betes" were considered nondiabetic. Age
of diagnosis of diabetes was determined
from the question, "How old were you
when a doctor or health professional first
told you that you had diabetes or sugar
diabetes?" We defined individuals aged
65 years as elderly. Elderly individuals
with diabetes diagnosed in middle age
(aged 40­64 years) were classified as
having middle age­onset diabetes and el-
derly individuals with recently diagnosed
diabetes, i.e., diabetes diagnosed at age
65 years, were classified as having el-
derly onset diabetes. Undiagnosed diabe-
tes was defined as a fasting glucose 126
mg/dl in the subsample of individuals
without a diagnosis of diabetes who at-
tended the morning examination session
and were fasting 8 h.

Assessment of demographics, health
conditions, and cardiovascular risk
factors
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity
(categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, or all
other) and smoking status was based on
self-report during the questionnaire por-
tion of the survey. Smoking status was
determined using answers to the ques-
tions, "Have you smoked at least 100 cig-
arettes in your life?" and "Do you now
smoke cigarettes?" During the interview,
participants were also asked questions re-
garding their history of cardiovascular
disease. For the purposes of this study,
prevalent cardiovascular disease was de-
fined as a self-reported history of coro-
nary heart disease, a previous heart
attack, or a history of stroke. Retinopa-
thy was also determined by self-report
and was only assessed in individuals
who reported a physician diagnosis of
diabetes.
Subclinical peripheral artery disease
can be determined with high sensitivity
and specificity using the ankle-brachial
index (ABI) (3,4). Ankle-brachial index
measurements were obtained from
NHANES 1999­2002 participants aged
40 years during the MEC exam. We de-
fined peripheral arterial disease on the ba-
sis of an ABI measurement 0.90 in
either leg (5).
Peripheral neuropathy was deter-
mined via monofilament testing of foot
sensation and examinations for foot ab-
normalities and lesions by trained health
technicians during the MEC examination.
Peripheral neuropathy was defined as one
or more insensate areas in either foot.
Hypertension was defined as a mean
systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg , a
mean diastolic blood pressure of 90
mmHg, or a reporting of a physician di-
agnosis of high blood pressure. Mean
blood pressure comprised up to four
readings on two separate occasions. Hy-
pertensive individuals who reported
being prescribed medication for hyper-
tension were categorized as having
treated hypertension. Total cholesterol
was measured enzymatically (6). Hyper-
cholesterolemia was defined as a total
cholesterol level 240 mg/dl, self-reports
of a physician diagnosis of "high choles-
terol," or self-reports that a physician had
advised taking a cholesterol-lowering
medication. Individuals who reported
having been prescribed treatment for high
cholesterol were categorized as having
treated hypercholesterolemia. Detailed
information regarding data collection in
NHANES 1999­2002 is available else-
where (6).
Statistical analysis
The NHANES surveys are ongoing, com-
plex, multistage probability samples of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population of
the U.S. The NHANES 1999­2002 survey
oversampled elderly individuals, low-
income individuals, adolescents, Mexican
Americans, and non-Hispanic blacks to
provide more reliable estimates for these
population subgroups.
Analyses were performed using Stata
version 8.2 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX) svy commands to obtain unbiased es-
timates from the complex NHANES sam-
pling design. SEs for all estimates were
obtained using the Taylor series (linear-
ization) method (6).
RESULTS
Prevalence of diabetes in elderly
individuals
Among adults aged 65, the prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes was 15.3% (SE
0.8); when applied to the 2000 U.S. Cen-
sus population, this represents 5.4 mil-
lion individuals. The prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose
126 mg/dl) was 6.9% (SE 1.2), repre-
senting 2.4 million individuals. Among
elderly individuals with diagnosed diabe-
tes, 60.6% (SE 3.1) and 39.4% (SE 3.1)
had middle age­onset diabetes and el-
derly onset diabetes, respectively. Figure
1 displays the prevalence of undiagnosed
and diagnosed diabetes by age-group.
The distribution of self-reported age of di-
agnosis of diabetes among all participants
(all ages) with diagnosed diabetes in
NHANES 1999­2002 is shown in Fig. 2.
The peak of the distribution is between
ages 40 and 55, with a sharp decline after
age 65, which may partially reflect differ-
ences in screening practices among el-
derly individuals.
Demographic characteristics
The characteristics of elderly and noneld-
erly adults with and without diabetes in
the U.S population are displayed in Table
1. The mean age of elderly individuals
with middle age­onset diabetes was 72
compared with 77 among individuals
with elderly onset diabetes. African Amer-
icans were also disproportionately repre-
sented among the middle age­ onset
elderly diabetes group. Mean BMI and
waist circumference were similar among
individuals with middle age­onset and
elderly onset diabetes.
Treatment characteristics
As shown in Table 2, mean fasting glucose
was higher among elderly individuals
with middle age­onset diabetes com-
pared with elderly onset diabetes (172.4
vs. 132.3 mg/dl, P  0.001). Indeed, el-
derly individuals with middle age­onset
diabetes had higher fasting glucose values
than nonelderly (aged 40­64 years) dia-
betic individuals (mean fasting glucose 
148.9 mg/dl). Similar trends were ob-
served for glycemic control, as measured
by HbA1c
(A1C). Middle age­onset el-
derly diabetic subjects had substantially
worse glycemic control (proportion of in-
dividuals with A1C 7%  59.9%) com-
pared with either elderly onset diabetic
subjects (41.6%, P  0.005) or noneld-
erly diabetic subjects (55.3%).

Elderly-onset diabetic subjects were
also much less likely to be taking glucose-
lowering medications (insulin, oral med-
ications, or both) compared with elderly
individuals whose diabetes was diag-
nosed in middle age. Of middle age­
onset elderly diabetic subjects, 31.7%
were currently receiving insulin alone
compared with 6.9% of the elderly onset
diabetic subjects (P  0.0001). In a mul-
tivariable logistic regression model, these
differences in medication use were not ex-
plained by age, sex, race, education, cog-
nitive function, or measures of physical
functioning (analysis not shown).
Burden of micro- and macrovascular
disease
A history of stroke, coronary heart dis-
ease, and any cardiovascular disease were
similar among the middle age­ and el-
derly onset diabetic subjects aged 65
years. As might be expected, both of these
groups had a substantially higher burden
of cardiovascular disease compared with
nonelderly diabetic subjects; any form of
cardiovascular disease was more than
twice as common among elderly than
among nonelderly diabetic subjects. Pe-
ripheral arterial disease determined on
the basis of a low ABI was similar in the
two elderly diabetic groups but was sub-
stantially higher than the prevalence
among elderly individuals without diabe-
tes or with middle age­onset diabetes.
Whereas the prevalence of chronic kidney
disease and peripheral neuropathy were
similar among elderly individuals with
middle age­ and elderly onset diabetes,
the prevalence of retinopathy was sub-
stantially higher in the middle aged­
onset diabetic group (39.4 vs. 12.6%, P 
0.001). As will be discussed below, these
prevalence estimates probably reflect the
differential survival of the elderly individ-
uals in the middle age­ and elderly onset
diabetic groups. Nonetheless, because the
cut point of age 65 years to define elderly
individuals is essentially arbitrary, we
conducted sensitivity analyses to assess
the impact of this definition. Similar re-
sults were obtained using other cut points
between ages 60 and 70 years to define
individuals as elderly (data not shown).
Control of cardiovascular risk
factors
We also compared control of cardiovas-
cular risk factors (hypertension, choles-
terol, and smoking) across diabetes status
in the nonelderly and elderly populations.
Hypertension was extremely common
(80% prevalence) in elderly individuals
with middle age­ and elderly onset diabe-
tes; however, elderly individuals with
middle age­onset diabetes were more
likely to be treated than elderly onset di-
abetic subjects (71.7 vs. 59.3%, P 
0.001). High cholesterol and its control

followed a similar pattern, with a high
prevalence in both elderly individuals
with middle age­onset diabetes and indi-
viduals with elderly onset diabetes (55 vs.
45.4%, P  0.22). The prevalences of
treated hypercholesterolemia in these two
groups were 50.4 and 39.3%, respectively
(P  0.003). Although the prevalence of
hypertension and cholesterol treatment
differed, mean levels of these risk factors
were similar. In elderly individuals with
middle age­onset diabetes, mean systolic
blood pressure was 140.2 mmHg, and in
individuals with elderly onset diabetes it
was 140.6 mmHg (P  0.930). A similar
pattern was observed for mean choles-
terol levels, with mean total cholesterol
levels of 200.8 mg/dl in elderly individu-
als with middle age­onset diabetes and
197.0 mg/dl in individuals with elderly
onset diabetes (P  0.558). Smoking rates
in elderly onset and middle age­onset el-
derly diabetic subjects were similar (10.0
vs. 7.5%, P  0.22) but much lower than
those in nonelderly individuals, who had
a current smoking prevalence of 24% in
both the diabetic and nondiabetic groups.
CONCLUSIONS -- This study pro-
vides an overall picture of the character-
istics of individuals with middle age­
onset and elderly onset diabetes and the
burden of microvascular and macrovas-
cular disease and control of risk factors in
these groups. Our overarching conclu-
sion is that elderly individuals with mid-
dle age­ and elderly onset diabetes
represent distinct groups with differing
burdens of disease and possibly differing
treatment goals. Treatment of diabetes
differed considerably between these two
groups, and A1C levels were significantly
higher in individuals with middle age­
onset diabetes. Elderly individuals with
middle age­onset diabetes were more
likely to be treated for hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia than elderly onset
diabetic subjects; however, mean systolic
blood pressure values and mean total cho-
lesterol levels were similar in elderly indi-
viduals with middle age­ onset and
elderly onset diabetes, suggesting that el-
derly individuals may actually require less
treatment to remain in control of cardio-
vascular risk factors.
Previous studies of diabetes in elderly
individuals have not distinguished be-
tween individuals with diabetes who were
diagnosed at younger ages and those with
elderly onset diabetes. It has been stated
that "very few older people truly have new
onset diabetes" (7). Ostensibly, because
there are no clear screening recommenda-
tions for diabetes in elderly individuals
and because symptoms may be less recog-
nizable or lacking, detection of new-onset
diabetes in elderly individuals regardless
of its presence may be uncommon. None-
theless, because NHANES obtained fast-
ing glucose measurements from
participants, we were able to estimate the
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes
among elderly individuals. We found that
6.9% of elderly individuals had undiag-
nosed diabetes, representing 2.4 mil-
lion individuals in the U.S. population.
Few data on the actual incidence of new-
onset diabetes in elderly individuals exist,
and our understanding of the epidemiol-
ogy and natural history of this condition is
poor. The information presented here
suggests that the two groups are distinct
and speaks to the need to consider elderly
individuals with diabetes diagnosed in
middle age differently from individuals
with elderly onset diabetes.
The substantial difference in age be-
tween the middle age­onset and elderly
onset diabetic subjects (5 year differ-
ence) probably reflects a "survival effect"
in these cross-sectional data. That is,
those individuals with middle age­onset
diabetes are more likely to die at younger

ages compared with individuals with el-
derly onset diabetes who, by definition,
must be aged 65 years when diabetes is
diagnosed. This may also explain why the
burden of cardiovascular disease was sim-
ilar between the groups. By definition,
duration of diabetes also differed consid-
erably in the two groups, reflected in the
significantly higher prevalence of retinop-
athy in the middle age­onset diabetic
group. In this cross-sectional study, we
could not rigorously address how dura-
tion of diabetes contributed to the ob-
served differences. Indeed, we lacked
data on the timing of disease develop-
ment, and we could not characterize the
progression from impaired glucose toler-
ance to undiagnosed diabetes in this pop-
ulation. This is an inherent weakness in
these cross-sectional survey data. The
presence of a survival effect highlights the
need for prospective epidemiologic
studies to examine the natural history of
diabetes in the elderly population. Addi-
tionally, because self-reported informa-
tion was used for determination of a
history of cardiovascular disease and ret-
inopathy, we may have underestimated
the burden of these conditions in this
population.
Current clinical guidelines for the
treatment of hypertension (Seventh Re-
port of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC
7]) recommend explicitly that the same
principles outlined for the general care of
hypertension should be followed for
older individuals. Hypertension occurs in
more than two-thirds of elderly individu-
als, and multiple drugs are often needed
to achieve recommended blood pressure
goals. Nonetheless, these guidelines cau-
tion that orthostatic hypotension is a risk
in individuals with diabetes and in elderly
individuals, especially when multiple
medications are used. The American Dia-
betes Association and the American Geri-
atrics Society additionally recommend
that that blood pressure should be low-
ered gradually to avoid complications in
elderly hypertensive patients with diabe-
tes (8,9), but no specific recommenda-
tions have been made regarding during
what period of time blood pressure
should be lowered. Subgroup analyses of
clinical trial data of statin therapies sup-
port lipid control in elderly individuals at
high risk for cardiovascular disease (10­
13), but there are limited data specifically
for elderly patients with diabetes. Current
diabetes treatment guidelines recom-
mend aggressive lipid control in all pa-
tients with diabetes but do not make
specific recommendations for elderly
individuals.
Higher glycemic goals may also be ap-
propriate for individuals with severe or
frequent hypoglycemia, a common prob-
lem for elderly individuals. Citing the lack
of clinical trial data in elderly patients, the
American Diabetes Association recom-
mends that "less stringent treatment
goals" may be appropriate in elderly pa-
tients. The Merck Manual of Geriatrics (14)
recommends a glycemic goal of A1C
7% for all elderly patients but states that
"most elderly patients can be treated as
aggressively as younger patients, but
some require modifications based on
their life expectancy, functional status,
cognitive abilities, preferences, and mul-
tiple other factors."
In this study, we document a high
prevalence of diabetes in the elderly pop-
ulation and a high rate of poor glycemic
control regardless of age of diagnosis.
Data and rigorous studies of new-onset
diabetes in elderly subjects are needed to
characterize the natural history of diabe-
tes in the elderly population, and future
researchers on diabetes in elderly individ-
uals may need to consider stratification
based on age of diabetes diagnosis.
