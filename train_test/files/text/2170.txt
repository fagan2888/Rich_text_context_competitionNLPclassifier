Legal status and source of offenders' firearms in
states with the least stringent criteria for
gun ownership
Katherine A Vittes, Jon S Vernick, Daniel W Webster
ABSTRACT
Background Gun possession by high-risk individuals
presents a serious threat to public safety. U.S. federal
law establishes minimum criteria for legal purchase and
possession of firearms; many states have laws
disqualifying additional categories for illegal possession.
Methods We used data from a national survey of state
prison inmates to calculate: 1) the proportion of offenders,
incarcerated for crimes committed with firearms in 13
states with the least restrictive firearm purchase and
possession laws, who would have been prohibited if their
states had stricter gun laws; and 2) the source of gun
acquisition for offenders who were and were not legally
permitted to purchase and possess firearms.
Results Nearly three of ten gun offenders (73 of 253 or
28.9%) were legal gun possessors but would have been
prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms when
committing their most recent offense if their states had
stricter prohibitions. Offenders who were already prohibited
under current law acquired their gun from a licensed dealer,
where a background check is required, five times less often
than offenders who were not prohibited (3.9% vs. 19.9%;
c2¼13.31; p#0.001). Nearly all (96.1%) offenders who
were legally prohibited, acquired their gun from a supplier
not required to conduct a background check.
Conclusions Stricter gun ownership laws would have
made firearm possession illegal for many state prison
inmates who used a gun to commit a crime. Requiring all
gun sales to be subject to a background check would make
it more difficult for these offenders to obtain guns.
INTRODUCTION
Gun violence has long been one of the most
significant public safety and social problems in the
USA. In the USA, in 2008, gun violence resulted in
12 179 homicides and an estimated 56 626 assaul-
tive injuries serious enough to warrant a hospital
emergency room visit.1 Among high-income coun-
tries, the USA is unique in its extraordinarily high
rate of homicides. This disparity is most striking for
homicides committed with firearms where the US
rate is 20 times higher than other high-income
countries.2
Despite the magnitude of the problem, US gun
policy rarely considers appropriate criteria for
disqualifying someone from lawfully possessing
a firearm. Federal law disqualifies certain groups of
high-risk individuals from owning guns, including
felons, fugitives, unlawful users of or those
addicted to controlled substances, those who have
been `adjudicated as a mental defective' or
committed to a mental institution, individuals who
have been dishonourably discharged from the
armed forces, persons subject to certain domestic
violence restraining orders, persons less than the
age of 18 years (for handguns) and domestic
violence misdemeanants. Federal law does not set a
minimum age requirement for the legal possession
of long guns (ie, rifles and shotguns).3
Although the federal firearm prohibitions apply
minimum standards for all US states, many states
have enacted broader disqualifications for firearm
possession including: a minimum age of 21 for all
guns; convictions for some misdemeanour crimes
involving violence, firearms or drugs; multiple
convictions for alcohol-related offences; or convic-
tions for serious crimes committed as a juvenile.4
Research supports the underlying premise of
laws that widen exclusionary criteria for firearm
possession: that some groups have higher rates of
criminal offending than do those without a crim-
inal history or other indicia of risk.5e9 For example,
Wintemute and colleagues found that individuals
denied legal handgun purchase, as a result of a new
California law expanding firearm prohibitions to
include misdemeanants convicted of crimes of
violence, were less likely to commit a new crime of
violence than were demographically-matched Cali-
fornian misdemeanants who had been approved for
handgun sales during the years just prior to the
new restrictions.9 A study of homicide offenders in
Illinois found that 42% would have been prohibited
from possessing firearms as a result of a prior felony
conviction; however, convictions for misdemean-
ours as an adult or more serious crimes as a juvenile
were not reported.6
Under federal law, persons buying guns from
licensed gun dealers must undergo a criminal
history background check.10 But federal law and
the law of most states do not require firearm sellers
who are not licensed gun dealers to verify that
purchasers of firearms are legally qualified to
possess a firearm such as through a background
check.4 Understanding how those with and
without a criminal history acquire guns can also
inform policies intended to keep guns from
prohibited persons.
Prior research on firearm acquisition suggests
that incarcerated adults often obtain their guns
from casual sources such as from friends and family
members, and `off the street.'11e13 To our knowl-
edge, whether and to what extent the source varies
based on the legal status of the purchaser has not
been investigated.
Therefore, the goals of the current study are to:
(1) identify the proportion of state prison inmates

strict standards for firearm purchase and possession who would
have been prohibited from possessing firearms if laws in their
states had included additional exclusion criteria and (2) describe
how these inmates acquired their firearms.
METHODS
Data
This study used data from the most recent (2004) Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF), a nationally-
representative survey of state prison inmates administered by
the Bureau of the Census for the US Department of Justice.14
The 2004 SISCF consisted of computer-assisted personal inter-
views conducted between October 2003 and May 2004. Inmates
were asked about a broad range of topics including: demographic
characteristics; offences for which they were currently serving
time; prior criminal history; gun possession and use; prior drug
and alcohol use and treatment; and physical and mental health
status. In the 2004 survey, 14 499 inmates were interviewed. Of
those eligible to participate in the study, 89.1% participated.
Additional information about data collection and analysis
methodology for the SISCF is available from the University of
Michigan's Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research.15 Prior research using data from the SISCF include
studies on incarcerated women, veterans and parents.16e18 No
reported studies have used SISCF data on inmates who used
firearms in their most recent crimes.
Study sample
To focus on the potential effects of broadening state laws
regarding firearm restrictions, we limited our analysis to
offenders currently serving time for an offence committed with
a firearm in states that, as of 2004, did not have laws prohibiting
persons in the following five groups from purchasing or
possessing a firearm: (1) persons less than 21 years of age; (2)
persons convicted of a serious juvenile offence; (3) violent
misdemeanants; (4) drug misusers; and (5) alcohol abusers. To
identify states meeting these criteria, we consulted the Bureau of
Justice Statistics 2004 Survey of State Procedures Related to
Firearm Sales,19 supplemented by legal research to confirm some
state laws.
Because domestic violence misdemeanants are already
prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms under federal
law,20e22 we included states with laws that prohibited domestic
violence misdemeanants if the states did not also prohibit other
violent misdemeanants from purchasing or possessing firearms.
In addition, although federal law restricts firearm purchase or
possession for drug misusers, the law's definition of a drug
misuser does not provide objective criteria that can be imple-
mented via a background check, limiting its practical use.23 We
excluded states with separate legal restrictions on possession of
firearms by those convicted of serious offences, not technically
classified as felonies, when committed by a juvenile.
Nine statesdArkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Missis-
sippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Vermont and
Wyomingdlacked all five types of expanded firearm disqualifi-
cations. Four additional statesdGeorgia, Maine, New Mexico
and Wisconsindlacked these expanded disqualifications with
some exceptions. For example, New Mexico had a minimum age
law stating that handgun possession is unlawful by persons
<19-years-old24 and Wisconsin restricted individuals convicted
of a felony as a juvenile only if the offence occurred on or after
21 April 1994.25 We excluded a total of 12 cases meeting these
exceptions, because they were already prohibited from firearm
purchase and possession under state law. The final sample
consisted of 13 states, though there were no inmates meeting
our case definition in two states (New Hampshire, Wyoming;
see table 1).
Measures
To determine whether offenders had a firearm while committing
the crime for which they were currently incarcerated, SISCF
interviewers asked, `Did you use, carry or possess a weapon
when the (.offense.) occurred?' If the answer was `yes,' the
interviewer asked, `What kind of weapon was it?' Offenders
who said they used a firearm were included in our analyses.
Offenders who reported using a firearm in their current crime
were asked follow-up questions, including questions about the
type of gun(s) (eg, handgun, shotgun, rifle), how and where they
obtained the gun, whether they fired it, and their reasons for
having it.
SISCF interviewers also asked the offenders a series of ques-
tions about their prior arrests and convictions leading to
probation or incarceration. Those who had been convicted and
sentenced to probation or incarceration were asked about the
type of offence, length of sentence, and whether they were
sentenced as a juvenile or as an adult for up to 10 prior proba-
tions and 10 prior incarcerations. Offence information for
juvenile convictions leading to probation and no incarceration
was not collected in the SISCF.
To examine the potential for current and expanded disquali-
fications to curtail gun crime, we categorised offenders into the
following groups based on their prior criminal convictions: (1)
those who would have no firearm disqualification even under
stricter state laws (described below); (2) those who were
disqualified under current federal law; and (3) those who were
legal firearm possessors under current federal law, but who
would have been prohibited in states with stricter standards.
We further categorised offenders in the third groupdthose
who might be impacted if the laws in their states were
changeddbased on whether they fell into any of the following
categories: (1) age 18e20 years at incarceration for their current
offence if that offence involved a handgun; (2) less than age
21 years at incarceration for their current offence if that offence
involved a long gun; (3) committed a prior serious crime as
a juvenile (<18-years-old); (4) conviction for a violent or fire-
arms-related misdemeanour; (5) convictions for two or more drug-
related misdemeanours; and (6) convictions for two or more
alcohol-related misdemeanours. These laws were chosen because
each is in effect in at least some states.19 Violent and firearm-
related misdemeanours included convictions for a simple assault
or a weapons offence. Drug-related misdemeanours included
convictions for driving under the influence of drugs, possession
or use of marijuana and unspecified drug-related offences (but
did not include drug-related offences involving heroin, powder
cocaine or crack cocaine which are generally felonies). Alcohol-
related misdemeanours included DUI/DWI convictions or
convictions for public drunkenness.
Analysis
We first calculated the proportion of offenders who would have
been legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms if
their states had a variety of stricter laws. We then examined the
method and source of firearm acquisition for offenders and
calculated c2 statistics to identify any significant differences
between offenders who were currently prohibited versus
offenders who were not prohibited from purchasing and
possessing firearms.

RESULTS
The overall SISCF sample of 50 states included 14 499 inmates,
2046 of whom used a gun in the crime for which they were
incarcerated. The distribution of the total sample of gun users
was similar to the 13 states in our sample with regard to crime
type, type of gun, sex, education, marital status and employ-
ment status. Our 13-state sample had a somewhat higher
proportion of younger (age 14e17 years) and non-Hispanic
Black offenders than for all 50 states.
Sample characteristics
Our initial sample consisted of 281 offenders who were incar-
cerated for offences involving firearms from the 13 states with
the most lenient firearm restrictions (no stricter than existing
federal law). Due to missing or insufficiently specific informa-
tion about the nature of the prior convictions, 28 offenders were
excluded from the analyses for a final sample of 253. The
majority of the respondents came from Georgia, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi and New Mexico. Some of the more
populous US states (eg, California, New York, Texas) were
excluded from our analysis because they did not meet our legal
inclusion criteria.
Three-quarters (n¼190) of offenders committed their current
offence (ie, the offence for which they were serving time when
the interview occurred) in their state of residence. All offenders
were sentenced as adults and age at sentencing for the current
incarceration ranged from 14 to 55 years with a mean of
25 years. A majority of the offenders were male subjects, non-
Hispanic Black, had not completed high school, were employed
in the month before they were incarcerated and had never been
married (table 1).
Current offences
More than three-quarters (n¼199) of the offenders were serving
time for a violent offence at the time of the SISCF interview. In
all, 43% of these violent offenders were incarcerated for an
attempted or completed murder, or voluntary non-vehicular
manslaughter (table 1). The remainder of the sample was
incarcerated for property, drug or public order offences (all
involving firearms).
Although fewer than half (44.3%) of the offenders reported
that they fired a gun while committing the current crime, most
(83.4%) identified one or more other or additional reasons for
possessing the gun, including using the gun to scare the victim(s)
(42.7%), or for self-protection (32.4%).
Legal status for firearm possession prior to firearm offence
leading to current incarceration
Inmates were categorised into three mutually-exclusive groups
based on their actual or potential legal status for firearm
possession (table 2). In all, 31% (n¼78) of offenders would not

have been disqualified from firearm possession based on prior
convictions or minimum age even if their states had laws
prohibiting the legal purchase and possession of firearms by
persons <21-years-old, persons with a conviction for a serious
juvenile offence, violent misdemeanants, and drug and alcohol
misusers.
In the second group, 40% (n¼102) of offenders were already
prohibited from legal firearm possession under current state or
federal law and, thus, would be unaffected by the imple-
mentation of the stricter firearm prohibition standards we
considered.
The third group consists of 73 offenders (28.9%) who were
not prohibited under current standards, but would have been
prohibited if their states adopted stricter standards similar to
those already in place in a number of other states. Most of this
group (58.9% and 17.0% of all firearm offenders, n¼43) would
have been prohibited if their state had a law that raised the
minimum age to possess a handgun to 21 years. An additional 17
offenders would have been prohibited if their state passed a law
restricting possession to all firearms, including long-guns, for
persons <21 years. If persons convicted of a serious crime as
a juvenile were to become prohibited, it would have been illegal
for 13 offenders (5.1% of all firearm offenders) to purchase or
possess a firearm. Nine offenders (3.6% of all firearm offenders)
would also have been disqualified if their states had prohibited
persons convicted of a violent or firearms-related misdemeanour
from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Two offenders would
have been prohibited if states were to restrict firearm purchase
and possession for those with two or more drug-related misde-
meanours and one offender would be prohibited if the same
restriction were applied to alcohol-related misdemeanours.
How and where criminals obtained their firearms
About eight of every 10 offenders reported using a handgun (vs
rifle or shotgun) in the offence for which they were serving time.
Half of the offenders reported that they had bought the gun
used in the crime (table 3). The second most common method of
gun acquisitiondcited by fewer than one in five offendersdwas
borrowing or holding the gun for someone. Regardless of how
they obtained the gun, friends and family members were the
most common source (34.0%), followed by drug dealers or other
black market sources (30.4%). Only 13.4% got the gun directly
from a gun store or pawnshop where federal law requires
prospective firearm purchasers to pass a background check. It is
important to recognise, however, that table 3 represents only the
most recent acquisition of a specific gun: it does not indicate
whether the gun ever passed through a particular distribution
channel (eg, a gun show).
There were few differences between the groups of offenders
with regard to how and where they got the gun used in their
most recent offence. More than half (55.6%) of offenders for
whom firearm purchase and possession was legal under current
standards (adding the 45 inmates who would be legal even under
stricter standards with the 39 inmates who would be prohibited
only under stricter standards) bought or traded for the gun used
in their most recent crime compared with two-fifths (39.2%) of
offenders who were prohibited under current state or federal law
(c2¼6.56; p#0.01). Offenders who were prohibited from
purchasing and possessing a gun under current law acquired
their gun from a licensed dealer, where a background check
would be required, five times less often than offenders who were
not prohibited (3.9% vs 19.9%; c2¼13.31; p#0.001). Similarly,
nearly all (96.1%) offenders who were legally prohibited from
possessing a firearm acquired their gun from a supplier not
required to conduct a background check.
DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that 40% of offenders incarcerated for
committing crimes with a gun in the 13 US states with the least
strict standards for legal firearm purchase and possession were in
possession of the gun illegally. If these states had adopted more
restrictive standards like those in place in a number of other
states, an additional 29% of the persons incarcerated for
committing a crime with a firearm would have been legally
prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time of their current
offence. The vast majority of these individualsdnearly a quarter
of the entire sample of firearm offendersdwould have been
prohibited if the minimum legal age for possessing any type of
firearm was 21 years. An additional 9.9% would have been
legally prohibited from firearm possession as a result of convic-
tions for serious crimes as a juvenile or for misdemeanours
involving violence, firearms, drugs or alcohol.
Nearly one in five offenders was <18-years-old at the time
they were sentenced for the current offence; 41.9% were less
than age 21 when sentenced. An even greater proportion would

have fallen into the <18 group if we had data on offenders' age
at the time the offence occurred rather than age at incarceration.
These findings underscore the importance of minimum-age
restrictions for firearms possession and disqualifications for
serious offences committed as juveniles, even if the duration of
these disqualifications is limited.
It is also important to consider the political feasibility of any
new restrictions on access to firearms. In a 1998 survey, a large
majority of respondentsdincluding the majority of gun
ownersdfavoured laws that would restrict guns from various
categories of misdemeanants including assault and battery
without a lethal weapon or serious injury, driving under the
influence of alcohol, and carrying a concealed weapon without
a permit.26 Although public support was strong for a variety of
firearm laws, firearm restrictions based on criminal history may
be among the most politically feasible.23 27 Each firearm policy
considered in this study is currently law in at least some states.
Although setting appropriate standards for legal firearm
ownership is important, it is equally important to make sure that
databases used to screen gun purchasers and ascertain legal status
for gun possession are up-to-date so that prohibited individuals
can be identified. For example, juvenile convictions must be
recorded in an accessible database so that they are picked up in
background checks in order for prohibitions for serious offences
committed as a juvenile to be useful in restricting the legal
purchase and possession of firearms in this high-risk group.
Relatively few offenders purchased their guns directly from
licensed firearms dealers. Only 3.9% of individuals disqualified
based on current federal or state prohibitions and 3.8% who
were <21-years-old at the time of their incarceration obtained
their gun from a licensed firearms dealer. Presumably most, if not
all, of these prohibited individuals purchased their firearm prior
to becoming a prohibited person. Among individuals who
appeared to be legally qualified to purchase firearms, only one in
five (19.9%) obtained their firearm directly from a licensed
firearm dealer, perhaps to avoid having their firearms trans-
actions recorded and therefore traceable to the purchaser. Given
offenders' preferences for new firearms,13 28 it is noteworthy
how criminals avoid the regulated gun market of licensed sellers
and prefer the largely unregulated market involving unlicensed
sellers where new guns may be harder to obtain. The lack of
regulation of firearm sales by unlicensed sellers is likely to
significantly limit the government's ability to keep firearms
from prohibited individuals.28 Requiring all gun sales to be
subject to a background check, and holding sellers accountable
for failure to do so, are policies that could address this problem.29
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use data on gun
offenders' age and criminal histories to examine the potential
benefits of strengthening the criteria for legal firearm possession.
Nonetheless, it is subject to several limitations. The data used in
this analysis come from inmates' self-report. As such, they share
the limitations inherent to all self-report data (eg, recall and
social desirability bias). And although the data were drawn from
a nationally-representative survey of state prison inmates, they
are not necessarily representative of state prison populations. In
addition, the 13 states in our sample may not have the same
distribution of offenders as in all 50 states. For example, the five
states with the most offenders in our sample may be more
urban, on average, than the USA as a whole. We chose states for
inclusion in the sample based on their laws in 2004, the year the
SISCF survey took place. These laws may be different from the
laws that were in effect at the time the offenders were convicted
for their prior offences, though it is rare for laws prohibiting
certain persons from owning guns, based on criminal history, to
be repealed. Moreover, we were unable to determine whether the
guns used in the current crimes were obtained in the state in
which the crime was committed. This is particularly relevant for
considering criteria for firearm purchase rather than possession.
The numbers of offenders with prior misdemeanour convic-
tions are likely undercounted because we did not have status
information about juveniles sentenced to probation nor did we
have information about persons who were convicted but not
sentenced to probation or incarceration (eg, those sentenced
only to pay a fine). It is also possible (though unlikely) that
some of the offenders with a prior felony had their gun rights
reinstated. Finally, it is also important to remember that this is
a prison population. As such, our findings may not generalise to
offenders who avoid imprisonment.
However, our sample comes from a large national survey of
state prison inmates and contains extensive information on their
prior criminal history. In addition, we have focused on the
population that is most likely to be affected by the policy
changes we considered by including only offenders who used
a firearm in their current offence.

Our findings indicate that stricter gun ownership laws in
states with the lowest standards would have made firearm
possession illegal for many who used a gun to commit a crime.
We are uncertain about the degree to which stricter legal stan-
dards for firearm possession might deter criminal gun possession
and use. But, adding barriers for the acquisition of guns by
high-risk persons is an underused potential intervention.

What is already known on the subject
< Guns in the hands of high-risk individuals present a serious
threat to public safety.
< Among high-income countries, the USA is unique in its
extraordinarily high rate of firearm homicides.
< US federal law establishes minimum criteria for who may
legally purchase and possess firearms; state laws vary widely
in this regard.
What this study adds
< This study is the first to use data on incarcerated gun
offenders' age and criminal histories to examine the potential
benefits from strengthening the criteria for legal firearm
possession.
< Nearly three of every 10 gun offenders in the 13 US states
with the least stringent criteria for legal gun ownership would
have been prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm
when they committed their most recent offence if their states
had more restrictive laws in place.
< Offenders for whom access to firearms was legal under
current standards were five times more likely to have obtained
their gun from a gun store or pawnshop than were offenders
who were prohibited under current state or federal law.
