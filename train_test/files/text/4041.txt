Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, and it is
associated with a significant increase in morbidity and
mortality.1 Recent studies have demonstrated that atrial
sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation may increase atrial
fibrillation susceptibility.2,3 Chronic atrial pacing could
lead to sustained atrial fibrillation not only due to pacing-
induced electrical and structural remodeling,4­6 but also
due to autonomic nerve remodeling.7­10
It has been demonstrated that the renin­angiotensin
system (RAS) is involved in the initiation and maintenance
of atrial fibrillation.11 Angiotensin-(1­7) (Ang-(1­7)), as a
novel member of the RAS, was confirmed to counterbal-
ance the effects of Angiotensin II (Ang II).12,13 Our previ-
ous studies indicated that Ang-(1­7) could prevent atrial
electrical and structural remodeling in dogs with chronic
atrial tachycardia.14­16 The effects of Ang-(1­7) on atrial
sympathetic nerve remodeling are still unknown. The pur-
pose of this study was to investigate whether Ang-(1­7)
Angiotensin-(1­7) attenuates atrial
tachycardia-induced sympathetic
nerve remodeling

Abstract
Introduction: The effect of Angiotensin-(1­7) (Ang-(1­7)) on atrial autonomic remodeling is still unknown. We
hypothesized that Ang-(1­7) could inhibit sympathetic nerve remodeling in a canine model of chronic atrial tachycardia.
Materials and methods: Eighteen dogs were randomly assigned to sham group, pacing group and Ang-(1­7) group. Rapid
atrial pacing was maintained for 14 days in the pacing and Ang-(1­7) groups. Ang-(1­7) was administered intravenously
in the Ang-(1­7) group. The atrial effective refractory period and atrial fibrillation inducibility level were measured at
baseline and under sympathetic nerve stimulation after 14 days of measurement. The atrial sympathetic nerves labeled
with tyrosine hydroxylase were detected using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, and tyrosine hydroxylase
and nerve growth factor mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Pacing shortened the atrial effective refractory period and increased the atrial fibrillation inducibility level
at baseline and under sympathetic nerve stimulation. Ang-(1­7) treatment attenuated the shortening of the atrial
effective refractory period and the increase in the atrial fibrillation inducibility level. Immunohistochemistry and Western
blotting showed sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation in the pacing group, while Ang-(1­7) attenuated sympathetic nerve
proliferation. Ang-(1­7) alleviated the pacing-induced increases in tyrosine hydroxylase and nerve growth factor mRNA
expression levels.
Conclusion: Ang-(1­7) can attenuate pacing-induced atrial sympathetic hyperinnervation.

had a protective effect on sympathetic nerve remodeling in
chronic atrial tachycardia in dogs. We labeled the sympa-
thetic nerve with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as previously
reported.10
Materials and methods
Preparation of the canine model
All animal studies were approved by the experimental ani-
mal administration committee of Tianjin Medical
University and Tianjin Municipal Commission for
Experimental Animal Control. Eighteen mongrel dogs of
either sex weighing between 12 and 14 kg were included
in this study. All dogs were anesthetized with intravenous
pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) and ventilated with room
air. Under sterile conditions, a modified unipolar J-shaped
pacing lead (St. Jude Medical) was inserted through the
right jugular vein and the distal end of the lead was posi-
tioned in the right atrium, as described in a previous
study.14 Initial atrial capture was verified using an external
stimulator (ALC-V8, Shanghai Alcott Biotech CO. LTD,
and China). The proximal end of the pacing lead was then
connected to a programmable pacemaker (made in
Shanghai Fudan University, China), which was inserted
into a subcutaneous pocket in the neck. The dogs in the
pacing and Ang-(1­7) groups were paced at 500 beats/min
for a period of 14 days. The dogs in the sham group
received a pacemaker implant but did not undergo pacing.
During the pacing, Ang-(1­7) (6 g/kg per h) (Bachem
AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was given intravenously
through a jugular vein catheter by an ALZET® osmotic
pump (DURECT Corporation, Cupertino, CA, USA) con-
tinuously during pacing for 14 days. The surface electro-
cardiogram was verified to ensure continuous 1:1 atrial
capture every other day. Direct systolic blood pressure was
measured during anesthesia before and after 14 days' pac-
ing by a multichannel physiological recorder (TOP 2001,
Hongtong Inc., China).
Two weeks after the pacemaker implant, all dogs were
intubated and mechanically ventilated with room air.
Under sterile conditions, a median sternotomy was per-
formed. Six pairs of electrodes (diameter: 1.5 mm; dis-
tance between poles: 1.5 mm) were stitched onto the left
and right atrial epicardia. The corresponding sites were in
the high left atrium, low left atrium, and left atrial
appendage (HLA, LLA, and LAA, respectively), and in
the same sites of the right atrium (HRA, LRA, and RAA,
respectively).
Measurement of atrial effective refractory
period and atrial fibrillation inducibility
The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) at each site
was measured by programmed pacing from the
multi-channel electrophysiology recorder (TOP 2001,
Hongtong Inc., China). There were eight sequential stimuli
(S1-S1, cycle length 250 ms) followed by one premature
stimulus (S2) with a doubling pacing threshold. The S1­S2
interval progressively decreased by 10 ms and, subse-
quently, 2 ms near the refractory value to ensure accurate
recording. AERPs were the longest coupling interval that
failed to capture the atrium.
Atrial fibrillation was defined as P-wave disappearance
and rapid atrial activation with irregular ventricular
response and a duration of more than 1 s. Atrial fibrillation
was induced at the above six atrial sites with a 5-s continu-
ous burst stimulation, at 10 Hz with four thresholds and
0.5-ms duration pulses. The burst stimulation was repeated
three times at each site and was recorded whenever atrial
fibrillation was successfully induced. If the atrial fibrilla-
tion duration time was longer than 60 s, rapid atrial pacing
or electrical conversion was used to reverse atrial fibrilla-
tion to sinus rhythm, since a prolonged period of atrial
fibrillation may induce transient atrial remodeling, pro-
voke longer episodes of atrial fibrillation and affect subse-
quent measurements.
After basic electrophysiological examination, the
AERPs and atrial fibrillation inducibility level were meas-
ured under sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS). The
bilateral stellate ganglia were carefully isolated from the
surrounding tissue. Two insulated bipolar electrodes were
attached to the dorsal and ventral ansae of both stellate
ganglia, which were then stimulated continuously with
pulses of 5 V for a duration of 0.5 ms and a frequency of
10 Hz. The stimulus intensity was adjusted by the heart
rate (HR), such that a HR increase of at least 30% was
maintained when compared with the basal sinus rhythm
rate throughout the measurement of AERPs and atrial
fibrillation inducibility level.
Immunohistochemistry study
After completing the electrophysiological measurement,
the left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) tissues were imme-
diately cut off and washed with cold 0.9% sodium chlo-
ride, while part of the tissue was fixed in formaldehyde
and used in immunohistochemistry studies. The remaining
tissue was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored sep-
arately at -80°C for molecular biological studies.
Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the
density and distribution of the sympathetic nerves
(TH-positive) in the atria. Five-micrometer (µm) sections
were cut from paraffin blocks of the LA and RA free walls,
which were then stained with TH to label the sympathetic
nerves. In brief, six sections from the LA and the RA were
used to analyze the sympathetic nerve density per canine.
We determined the fibrosis area using a computer-assisted
image analysis system (Image-Pro Plus 7.0, Media
Cybernetics, USA). The labels of all slides were covered,
Shangguan et al. 3
so that the investigator who counted the nerves was blinded
to the dog identification at the time of the nerve count.
Each slide was examined under a microscope, and six
fields with the highest density of sympathetic nerves were
selected by the investigator. The computer automatically
detected the stained nerves in these fields by their brown
color, and automatically calculated the area occupied by
the nerves in the field. The nerve density was the nerve-
positive stained area divided by the total area examined
(µm2/mm2). The mean nerve density in these six selected
fields was used to represent the nerve density of that slide.
Western blotting
LA and RA tissues from each group were prepared for
Western blotting analysis. Protein was extracted with total
protein extraction buffer. An equal amount of protein was
loaded onto a 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) denatur-
ing polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis,
transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
(Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and incubated
with a specific primary antibody at 4°C overnight. The
membranes were then washed and subsequently incubated
with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence. Protein levels of TH were expressed
as a ratio against the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Antibody to TH (ab93291) was
purchased from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, UK) and anti-
rabbit IgG HRP conjugate (W4011) was purchased from
Promega, Inc. (Madison, USA).
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
One aliquot of each tissue sample was used to investigate
the mRNA expression of TH and nerve growth factor
(NGF). In brief, 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in 1 ml
of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA was then
extracted with chloroform, precipitated in isopropyl alco-
hol and subsequently dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-
treated water. The integrity of each sample was confirmed
by analysis on a denaturing agarose gel. The concentration
of total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically at a
wavelength of 260 nm, and the RNA was stored at -80°C
for later analysis. Specific oligonucleotide primer pairs
used for the amplification of GAPDH, TH and NGF were
designed according to the sequences obtained from
GeneBank. The primers specific (forward/reverse) for
each protein were: 5-GGCGTGAACCATGAGAAG TAT-
3/5-GTGGAAGCAGGGATGATGTT-3 (GAPDH), 5-
TTCCAGTGCACGC AGTACAT-3/5-CGAACTCCACT
GTGAACCA-3 (TH), and 5-ACAGGACTCA CAG
GAGCAAG-3/5-TCCAGTGCTTGGAGTCGAT-3
(NGF). A 200 ng quantity of total RNA was converted to
cDNA and subjected to reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercially available
kit (TaKaRa, China). PCR was performed using the SYBR-
GreenPCRkitasdescribedbythemanufacturer(TransGen,
Beijing, China). The PCR consisted of 44 cycles of 95°C
for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s. The relative
mRNA expression levels were normalized to the GAPDH
gene according to the 2-Ct method. All the PCR experi-
ments were carried out in triplicate within each experi-
ment, and the experiments were replicated at least three
times.
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical compari-
sons among groups were performed with one-way analy-
ses of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, if significant
effects were indicated by ANOVA, all significant data
were analyzed with a t-test to evaluate the differences
between individual mean values. The inducible rate of
atrial fibrillation was analyzed with the exact probability
test. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
HR and blood pressure
There was no significant difference in HR and systolic
blood pressure between the three groups at baseline
(p>0.05), and the HR and systolic blood pressure were not
changed by atrial pacing in any of the groups (p>0.05;
Table 1)
AERPs
Two weeks of chronic atrial pacing markedly shortened
the AERPs in the pacing group compared with the sham
group (p<0.05). The Ang-(1­7) treatment attenuated the
pacing-induced AERPs. Shortening at the sites of the
HRA, HLA and LLA reached statistical significance
(p<0.05). SNS did not change the AERPs in the sham
group (p>0.05), but significantly decreased the AERPs in
the pacing group. Ang-(1­7) attenuated the pacing-
induced AERPs. The AERP shortening under SNS, at the
sites of the HRA, LRA, HLA and LLA, reached statisti-
cal significance, as compared with the pacing group
(p<0.05; Table 2)
Inducible rate of atrial fibrillation
Compared with the sham group, the pacing group showed
a significantly elevated atrial fibrillation inducibility level
(p<0.05). The Ang-(1­7) treatment reduced the atrial
fibrillation inducibility level compared with that in the
pacing group (p<0.05), though it was still higher than that
in the sham group (p<0.05). SNS increased the atrial

fibrillation inducibility level only in the pacing group
(p<0.05) and not in the Ang-(1­7) group (p>0.05; Table 3).
Sympathetic nerve density
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the density of
TH-positive nerves in the RAand LAwere all significantly
increased in the pacing group compared with that in the
sham group (LA: 3032±463 vs. 1613±725; RA: 3621±752
vs. 1180±441, p<0.05). Ang-(1­7) attenuated the atrial
pacing-induced atrial sympathetic hyperinnervation (LA:
3032 ± 463 vs. 2156 ± 873; RA: 3621±752 vs. 2621±752,
p<0.05; Table 4 and Figure 1).
The expression of TH protein
Western blotting showed that the level of TH protein was
significantly increased in the pacing group compared
with that in the sham group (p<0.05). In the sham group,
the LA exhibited a higher level of TH protein, although
this increase was not significant (p>0.05). In the pacing
group, both the LA and RA TH protein levels were sig-
nificantly increased (p<0.05), with the increase in the RA
TH protein level being greater than the increase in the LA
TH protein level, and the absolute increase in values
reached statistical significance (RA vs. LA, p<0.05).
Ang-(1­7) treatment reduced both the LA and RA TH
protein levels compared with those in the pacing group
(p<0.05), though they were still higher than those in the
sham group (p<0.05; Figure 2).
mRNA levels of TH and NGF
RT-PCR showed that the TH and NGF mRNA levels were
significantly increased in the pacing group (p<0.05), and
that Ang-(1­7) treatment reduced the mRNA levels of TH

Discussion
Main findings
The main findings of the present study were that two
weeks of chronic atrial pacing induced atrial sympathetic
hyperinnervation, and that Ang-(1­7) attenuated the pac-
ing-induced atrial sympathetic hyperinnervation and had
protective effects on atrial sympathetic nerve remodeling.
Effects of Ang-(1­7) on AERPs and atrial
fibrillation
The electrophysiological changes in the chronic atrial tachy-
cardia canine model observed in this study were similar to
those reported in the previous studies. Ang-(1­7) modulates
ionic channels15 and prevents atrial tachycardia-induced
ionic remodeling.16 Ang-(1­7) has been shown to attenuate
the rapid atrial pacing-induced shortening of AERPs and
reduce the vulnerability of atrial fibrillation, thereby pre-
venting atrial electrical remodeling.17 Ang-(1­7) also pre-
vented atrial electrical remodeling induced by atrial pacing
through the Mas/PI3K/Akt/NO signaling pathway.17
Atrial fibrillation and atrial sympathetic nerve
remodeling
Sympathetic nerve sprouting and proliferation may increase
the atrial fibrillation inducibility level. In the present study,

sympathetic nerve sprouting and proliferation were found
in the pacing group, and SNS decreased the AERPs and
increased the atrial fibrillation inducibility level. Our find-
ings are consistent with those of previous studies that dem-
onstrated that cardiac sympathetic innervation plays a
critical role in the dynamics of atrial fibrillation initiation
and maintenance.10 The catecholamines released by the
proliferation sympathetic nerve endings were found to
increase the heterogeneity of the AERPs and elevate the
atrial fibrillation inducibility level.18,19 Sympathetic
hyperinnervation in the pulmonary vein provides a sub-
strate for the trigger of rapid focal sources, thereby induc-
ing some atrial fibrillation episodes.20 Heterogeneous
sympathetic innervation also facilitates sustained atrial
fibrillation.8 These findings indicate that sympathetic
hyperinnervation may play an important role in the genera-
tion and maintenance of atrial fibrillation.
RAS-induced atrial sympathetic
hyperinnervation
The RAS is widely distributed in the sympathetic nerve sys-
tem and throughout the central nervous system, the periph-
eral nerve ganglia and even sympathetic nerve endings.21­26
Activation of the RAS can directly affect the brain and sym-
pathetic nerve ganglia, thereby increasing sympathetic out-
flow and causing excessive sympathoexcitation.27­29 NGF is
the main factor that stimulates the growth of sympathetic
nerves,30 and the RAS stimulates the synthesis of NGF,31
thereby promoting the growth of sympathetic nerves and
resulting in sympathetic nerve hyperinnervation. In the pre-
sent study, significantly increased NGF mRNA expression
levels were observed. During atrial fibrillation, the RAS
has been shown to increase the mechanical stretch of atrial
myocardial cells, resulting in the increased growth of
sympathetic neurocytes.32 Thus, the RAS plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of sympathetic nerve sprouting and
hyperinnervation.
Ang-(1­7) attenuates sympathetic nerve
remodeling
Ang-(1­7) inhibits the RAS and attenuates sympathetic
nerve remodeling. Gironacci et al.33 demonstrated that
Ang-(1­7) significantly decreased potassium-induced
norepinephrine release in the hypothalamus by stimulat-
ing the Ang II receptor. Moreover, Ang-(1­7) was
reported to inhibit the evoked release of norepinephrine
from the hypothalamus.34 Byku35 also showed that Ang-
(1­7) modulates sympathetic neurotransmitter overflow
in a manner that might oppose the effects of Ang II on
sympathetic neurotransmission. Ang II receptor blockers
have been shown to inhibit the RAS and abolish the
stretch-induced increase in NGF expression, thereby pre-
venting stretch-induced neural growth.36 Furthermore,
Ang-(1­7) might abolish stretch-induced NGF expres-
sion and inhibit sympathetic nerve growth by counterbal-
ancing the effects of Ang II. In the present study, we
found that Ang-(1­7) inhibits the activity of the sympa-
thetic nerves and attenuates both SNS-induced shorten-
ing of the AERPs and the increased atrial fibrillation
inducibility level.
Our study showed, for the first time, that Ang-(1­7)
could significantly attenuate atrial sympathetic hyperin-
nervation in a chronic atrial paced canine atrial fibrillation
model. Electrical, structural and autonomic remodeling
are the three main atrial remodeling mechanisms that act
as the foundation of atrial fibrillation initiation and main-
tenance. Ang-(1­7) effectively suppresses all three of
those mechanisms and has been speculated to act as an

those in the sham group (p<0.05).

effective agent in the treatment of atrial fibrillation; how-
ever, further clinical studies are necessary to verify this
hypothesis.
Study limitations
Pentobarbital is known to prolong the AERP compared
with the state of non-anesthesia, which may affect the
atrial fibrillation inducibility level. We did not measure the
levels of Ang-(1­7), which might have influenced the out-
comes of this study. Unfortunately, we were unable to
obtain specific canine NGF antibodies that could be used
to measure the changes in NGF protein expression levels.
Conclusion
Ang-(1­7) significantly attenuated atrial sympathetic
hyperinnervation in a chronic atrial pacing-induced canine
atrial fibrillation model. These results might help to eluci-
date the relationship between the RAS and atrial
fibrillation.
