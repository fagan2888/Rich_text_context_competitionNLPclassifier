Research Question
In this paper, I calculate unemployment multipliers of expenditure and revenue-
side fiscal consolidation policies in the presence of sectoral heterogeneity, ie. in the
presence of family and non-family firms.
Many countries have experienced a rise in government debt since the recent crisis,
which increases the need for fiscal consolidation, while, unemployment has simulta-
neously reaching historically high levels. Fiscal consolidation also affects unemploy-
ment. Our knowledge of unemployment fiscal multipliers is not complete, however.
Concerning expenditure-side unemployment multipliers, evidence about both the
sign and the magnitude is mixed. Moreover, there are not yet any revenue-based
unemployment fiscal multipliers.
I develop a model, based on a standard New Keynesian framework with search
and matching frictions, as an innovation, with sectoral heterogeneity, ie. family
and non-family firms. The motivation for this is that family-owned firms employ a
significant share of the labor force, and these firms behave differently in the labor
market. For the purpose of illustration, the model is calibrated to match data of
those European countries where family firms are present more than average in the
labor market.
Contribution
Regarding the existing literature, my results are consistent with the suggestion
that a tightening of fiscal policy on the expenditure side increases unemployment.
Moreover, consistent with Ball et al. (2013), a cut in government consumption im-
plies a more pronounced effect on unemployment than tax-based adjustments (only
at peak though). But the relevant authors consider a narrative approach, which
means they are unable to compare tax policies, while my paper is the first to pro-
vide estimates of unemployment multipliers of different tax policies. Furthermore,
sectoral heterogeneity on the firm side might explain the gap between theoretical
and empirical multipliers reported, but unexplained by Monacelli et al. (2010).
Results
My model predicts that fiscal austerity raises unemployment. At peak, the largest
increase in unemployment is implied by a cut in government consumption. Never-
theless, a hike in employees' labor income tax, cumulatively, implies the same size
of increase in unemployment as the government consumption cut does. A higher
employer social security contribution is, however, less costly in terms of employment
than an increase of the same scale in employees' labor income tax hike. Both at
peak and cumulatively, unemployment reacts least when the budget is consolidated
by increasing the rate of value added tax. However, there are trade-offs a policy-
maker must face, as the increase in value added tax results in the largest decline in
consumption.
Sectoral heterogeneity seems to play a crucial role, unemployment multipliers
are very different with and without it. Multipliers of labor income tax policies
and government consumption multipliers are usually biased downwards, while the
consumption tax multipliers are often biased upwards, when homogeneous firms are
considered. Thus, ignoring sectoral heterogeneity might lead to incorrect policy
conclusions, although, according to my results, budget consolidation is always least
harmful for employment when it is implemented by increasing consumption tax
revenue.

Forschungsfrage
In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Multiplikatoren der Arbeitslosigkeit bei ausgaben-
und einnahmenseitigen fiskalischen Sparmaßnahmen berechnet. Dabei wird eine sek-

Seit der j¨

Forschungsbeitrag
Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung entsprechen der in der Fachliteratur vorge-

sich K¨

arker auf die Arbeitslosigkeit aus
als steuerbasierte Anpassungen (allerdings nur in der Spitzenwertbetrachtung). Ball

Das in dieser Arbeit entwickelte Modell legt den Schluss nahe, dass Haushaltsspar-

Abstract
I calculate unemployment multipliers of fiscal consolidation policies in a standard,
closed-economy New Keynesian framework with search and matching frictions, and,
as an innovation, in the presence of sectoral heterogeneity. Family and non-family
firms behave differently in the labor market and are differently managed. This
latter assumption is modeled by the inclusion of intangible capital in the family
sector. The model is calibrated to match European data on countries with a large
percentage of family firms in the labor force. I find that fiscal austerity raises
unemployment. Both at peak and cumulatively, unemployment reacts least when
the budget is consolidated by increasing the rate of value-added tax. At peak, the
highest increase in unemployment is induced by a cut in government consumption,
but, cumulatively, a hike in employees' labor income tax is just as costly in terms of
employment. There are trade-offs, however, which a policymaker must face, as the
value-added tax increase results in the steepest decline in consumption. Sectoral
heterogeneity is crucial; multipliers of labor income tax policies and government
consumption multipliers are usually biased downwards, while the consumption-tax
multipliers are often biased upwards. Thus, ignoring sectoral heterogeneity might
lead to incorrect policy conclusions.

1 Introduction
Since the onset of the recent crisis, many countries have experienced a rise in
government debt, thus making urgent fiscal consolidation. At the same time, un-
employment in many countries has risen to historic heights. We know that fiscal
consolidation further affects unemployment, but we do not know the precise mech-
anism behind this phenomenon. This is the question which I address in this paper.
In particular, I calculate unemployment fiscal multipliers that show the effects of
temporary fiscal austerity policies on the unemployment rate. My paper contributes
to the literature in two ways (Subsection 1.1). First, there is a debate on the sign
and the magnitude of expenditure-side unemployment fiscal multipliers. Second, as
yet there are no revenue-side unemployment fiscal multipliers. The intent is to fill
both of these gaps of the literature.
The multipliers are based on a standard closed-economy New-Keynesian model
with search and matching frictions, and as a innovation, with family and non-family
firms on the firm side. The motivation behind this sectoral heterogeneity is that
firms are not homogeneous, as the standard macroeconomic models often assume.
Empirical firm-level evidence from the corporate finance literature indicates that
family firms behave differently in the labor market than non-family firms do (Sub-
section 1.2).
1.1 Unemployment fiscal multiplier literature
Unemployment fiscal multipliers show changes in the unemployment rate after a
temporary fiscal policy shock. The literature focuses on the expenditure side of the
budget. Monacelli et al. (2010) find that an increase of 1 percent of GDP gov-
ernment consumption decreases unemployment by 0.6 percentage points at peak3,
but their theoretical multiplier is much lower, around 0.2 percentage points. Simi-
larly, Edelberg et al. (1999), Fatas-Mihov (2001), Gali et al. (2007), Forni-Gambetti
(2010) and Mayer et al. (2010) claim that loosening fiscal policy implies an increase
in hours or employment.4
In contrast, Bruckner-Pappa (2012) suggest that an increase in government con-
sumption raises unemployment.5 Their model, which includes price rigidity, labor
force participation, as well as short- and long-term unemployment reproduces their
empirical findings. Gomes (2009) claims that a shock to government consump-
tion - without the inclusion of government employment in the model6 - implies a
close-to-zero effect on unemployment. Moreover, Dallari (2014) finds that the im-
pact multipliers of a cut in government consumption might be positive or negative.7

4Edelberg et al. (1999), Fatas-Mihov (2001) and Gali et al. (2007) consider 1-leisure as equal
to hours or employment in their framework, without, however, explicitly modeling unemployment,
while Forni-Gambetti (2010) provide empirical evidence based on a structural, large dimensional,
dynamic factor model.

points in unemployment at peak by estimating structural VARs of several OECD countries.

Thus, there is a debate on both the magnitude and the sign of the unemployment
multiplier of government consumption.
Most papers concentrate solely on government consumption, although different
government expenditure items might imply different employment effects.8 Bermper-
oglou et al. (2013) find that a decrease of 1 percent of GDP in government con-
sumption, government investment and public vacancies increase unemployment by
0.8, 0.8 and 1.8 percentage points respectively, while a decrease of 1 percent of GDP
in public wages reduces unemployment by 0.1 percentage points.9 A New Keynesian
model with labor force participation, short- and long-term unemployment and public
employment provides similar theoretical responses. At the same time, Gomes (2009)
shows that an increase in public vacancies results in higher unemployment, while
an increase in public wages declines unemployment. Moreover, Pappa (2009) finds
that a positive shock to public employment decreases total employment in several
US federal states.10 Also, Dallari (2014) demonstrates that after cuts in government
investment, unemployment multipliers of different countries have different signs and
magnitudes.11
The aforementioned studies rely on aggregate government expenditure data. At
the same time, the narrative approach achieves identification using historical records
of the policy decision-making process. Both Guajardo et al. (2011) and Ball et al.
(2013) suggest that fiscal tightening increases unemployment.12 Hernandez de Cos-
Moral-Benito (2011) report similar results.13
While there is no consensus in the literature regarding the sign or the magni-
tude of expenditure-side unemployment fiscal multipliers, I am not aware of any
unemployment multipliers of tax policies.14 Although Ball et al. (2013) claim
8Some papers specifically focus on military spending, which is not discussed here, see e.g.
Rotemberg-Woodford (1992), Ramey-Shapiro (1998), Burnside et al. (2004) and Ramey (2009).

12Both papers use a sample of OECD countries. Guajardo et al. (2011) claim that, two years
after the shock, a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP implies a 0.3 percentage point increase
in unemployment, while Ball et al. (2013) find that fiscal consolidation implies an increase in
long-term unemployment of about 0.5 percentage points in the medium-term.
13Based on a panel of OECD countries.
14Other streams of literature study the effects of tax policies and tax shifts on employment.
While a consensus has not been reached, it is unusual for the expenditure side of the budget to be
compared to the revenue side of the budget. A detailed review is beyond the scope of my paper,
but I would like to note the following: i) Concerning the effects of labor taxation on (cost of)
employment, usually based on aggregate data and econometric methodologies, some researchers
find an effect (Alesina-Perotti, 1997, Blanchard-Wolfers, 2000), while others do not (Bean, 1994);
furthermore, others report mixed results (Daveri et al. (2000) claim that there is a significant effect
in Continental Europe only). ii) While a significant share of public finance literature highlights
the equivalence between consumption and labor income taxes (described e.g. in Auerbach (2006)),
others claim the opposite (Blumkin et al., 2012, Sumpson, 1986). iii) Regarding tax shifts, in
particular, microsimulations also show an ambiguous picture, Thomas-Picos-Sanchez (2012) claim
that a shift from social security contribution to consumption taxes only slightly increases hours,
which is not in line with Pestel-Sommer (2013). iv) As regards other effects (growth, efficiency,
inequality, reform implementation), see among others Auerbach (2006) or Pestel-Sommer (2013).

that spending-based adjustments have a more pronounced effect than tax-based
adjustments, because these authors adopt a narrative approach they are not able
to compare separate tax policies. Staehler-Thomas (2012) study the unemployment
response of, likewise revenue-based, fiscal policies, but they consider permanent
shocks with a focus on long-run effects.15 Moreover, Canova-Pappa (2007)16 and
Caldara-Kamps (2008)17 study a single tax shock only, without distinguishing be-
tween different tax policies.
1.2 Data and literature on family firms
Many macroeconomic models, all of them in the unemployment fiscal multiplier
literature, assume a representative homogeneous firm. In my paper, I make a distinc-
tion between family and non-family firms, as, according to the available firm-level
evidence documented in the corporate finance literature, these two types of firms
behave very differently in the labor market. This divergent labor market behav-
ior might be interesting from the point of view of the effects of fiscal policy on
unemployment.
A family firm is a firm that is owned and/or managed by a family. As Anderson-
Reeb (2003) specify, a family firm is a firm where the fraction of equity owned by a
(founding) family is above a threshold, or one in which family members sit on the
board of directors.
The share of family firms in the European labor force is remarkable, as Table 118
shows. Almost every second worker in Europe is employed by a family firm. Family
firms are more prevalent in some countries than in others, employing 54.6 and 35.2
percent of the labor force, respectively.19

19Regarding the number of firms, the share of family firms is even larger, see for example La
Porta et al. (1999) and Mandl (2008).
3
Table 2: Unemployment rate by share of family firms in the European labor force
In addition, the level of unemployment is, on average, lower in countries where
there are fewer family firms (Table 2), 5.0 percent compared to 8.1 percent other-
wise.20
Despite their remarkable labor market share, family firms have not attracted much
macroeconomic research attention.21 At the same time, many of their characteristics
are documented in the corporate finance literature, based on firm-level data.
First, family firms behave differently in the labor market, compared to non-family
firms. On the one hand, job security is stronger among family firms.22 Bassanini et
al. (2011) use matched employer-employee data of French companies, and find that
the dismissal rate of family firms is lower, and so is the subjective risk of dismissal
perceived by the workers. Also, family firms rely less on dismissal and more on
reducing hiring when they have to cut their number of employees.
Sraer-Thesmar (2007), using a French sample of stock exchange-listed companies,
point out that family firms pay lower wages, even after controlling for the skill
and age structure of the workers. Similarly, Bassanini et al. (2011) show that
family firms pay a lower wage on average than do non-family firms, and this is
due to differences in unoberserved characteristics of family and non-family owned
enterprises. Furthermore, when a firm becomes non-family owned, its wages drop.
20The author's calculation based on Eurostat data between 2000 and 2012, and Mandl (2008),
IEF (2009), IFB (2011), Bjuggren et al. (2011) and Lindow (2013).
21Regarding the macroeconomic relevance of family firms, I am aware of only a single paper,
Caselli-Gennaioli (2013), which treats this topic. Based on a simple growth model, these authors
claim a relationship between family management and the health of financial markets; that is, the
worse a financial market is functioning, the greater number of family-managed firms there will be.
This and the claim that family managers are less talented at running firms imply that the share of
family firms is important in explaining cross-country income differences. However, these researchers
do not talk about the labor market. Recently, Epstein-Shapiro (2014) studied labor market policies
in a model with small and large firms. However, they did not consider fiscal consolidation policies,
and they focused only on firm size, rather than including other firm characteristics.
22Furthermore, not only is the job security of family firms greater, but these firms are also less
likely to exit the market (Nunes et al., 2014).
4
Moreover, worker influence on wage setting is lower in family firms. Still, employees
of family firms, compared to their counterparts in the non-family sector, are more
loyal to their employers. Siebert et al. (2011) claim that this greater loyalty stems
from long-term employment.
Second, as Caselli-Gennaioli (2013) point out, "inter-generational transmission
of managerial responsibilities", ie. dynastic management, is crucial for family firms.
The current owner or manager ("the son") of the firm inherits managerial know-how
- related to customers, suppliers and other market operators - from the previous
owner or manager ("the father").
There is no consensus in the literature, however, as to whether family firms are
more or less productive than non-family firms. Bennedsen et al. (2007) claim that
family management has a negative impact on firm performance. However, Maury
(2006) and others, Anderson-Reeb (2003), Villalonga-Amit (2006) and King-Santor
(2007), find that the relationship between family management and firm performance
is not monotonic.
A general misunderstanding about family firms is that all of them are small.23 As
Mandl (2008) highlights, the family business sector is mainly dominated by small-
and medium-sized companies. However, some of the largest firms are also family
firms. Examples of these are Volkswagen, Metro or Bosch.24 Also, as IFERA (2003)
claims, not only is Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies of the world, a family
company, but further 35 percent of the 500 biggest US companies are family firms.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the size structure of European (family) firms.
Figure 1: Size structure of European (family) firms (Mandl, 2008, page 50)
23According to the Eurostat, a micro or small firm employs fewer than 50 people, a medium-sized
firm employs between 50 and 249 people, while a large enterprise has at least 250 employees.

5
When considering employment or turnover instead of number of firms, the domi-
nance of small firms among family firms is even lower. According to Mandl (2008),
the share of family firms with an annual turnover higher than EUR 50 million is
34 percent in Germany. Also, in Ireland 27.1 percent and in Finland 22 percent of
large firms are family firms. In the UK, the share of large firms in the family sector
is also notable, although it is lower (15.6 percent, IFB, 2011). In Italy, the average
number of employed people is 68 in the family sector and 305 in the non-family
sector, based on Navaretti et al. (2008).
Another common misperception is that family firms are not export-oriented. Ac-
cording to IFB (2011), in the UK, 19 percent of family firms sold exports last year,
while the relevant non-family value is a bit lower, 15 percent. Regarding Spain, both
the export propensities and the export intensities of family and non-family firms are
very similar (71.1 and 68.8, and 20.9 and 25.3 percents, respectively), as shown by
Merino et al. (2012). Similar conclusions can be drawn for Italy (Navaretti et al.,
2008 and Minetti et al., 2013).
1.3 Outline of the paper
Thus, our incomplete knowledge of unemployment fiscal multipliers motivates my
work in this paper. Concerning the expenditure side, the evidence is mixed about
both the sign and the magnitude. Moreover, there are not yet any unemloyment
multipliers of tax policies. This, together with the fact that family firms employ a
notable share of the labor force in Europe, and that these firms behave differently
than non-family firms in the labor market brought me to my present goal: to esti-
mate unemployment multipliers of expenditure and revenue-side fiscal consolidation
policies in the presence of sectoral heterogeneity, ie. in the presence of family and
non-family firms.
Specifically, I develop a model, based on a standard, closed-economy New Keyne-
sian framework with search and matching frictions, as an innovation, with sectoral
heterogeneity, ie. family and non-family firms. I concentrate on the different labor
market behavior of family firms, as well as introduce an intangible capital25 in the
family sector, which enables me to model the dynastic management of family firms.
The presence of the two sectors creates the possibility of sectoral movements due
to changes in relative sectoral prices and wages. For the purpose of illustration, the
model is calibrated to match data of those European countries where family firms
have an above-average presence in the labor market.
My model predicts that fiscal austerity raises unemployment. At peak, the highest
increase in unemployment is implied by a cut in government consumption. Neverthe-
less, an increase in employees' labor income tax, cumulatively, implies the same size
increase in unemployment as does the government consumption cut. A higher em-
ployer social security contribution is, however, less costly in terms employment than
an increase on the same scale in the tax on employees' labor income. Both at peak
and cumulatively, unemployment reacts least when the budget is consolidated by

are used interchangeably.

increasing the rate of value-added tax. Yet, a policymaker must manage trade-offs,
as the increase in value-added tax results in the steepest decline in consumption.
Sectoral heterogeneity seems to play a crucial role: unemployment fiscal multipli-
ers are very different with and without it. When homogeneous firms are considered,
multipliers of labor income tax policies and government consumption multipliers
are usually biased downwards, while consumption tax multipliers are often biased
upwards. Thus, ignoring sectoral heterogeneity might lead to incorrect policy con-
clusions, although, according to my results, budget consolidation is always least
harmful for employment when it is implemented by increasing consumption tax
revenue.
Regarding the existing literature, qualitatively, my results are in line with those of
authors who suggest that tightening fiscal policy on the expenditure side increases
unemployment. As regards the size of the unemployment multiplier of government
consumption, it is close to Monacelli et al. (2010). Moreover, my results are con-
sistent with Ball et al. (2013) who show that spending-based adjustments have a
more pronounced effect on unemployment than tax-based adjustments (only at peak,
however). But, as they use a narrative approach, they are not able to compare dif-
ferent tax policies (as I am). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper
to provide estimates of unemployment multipliers of tax policies. Finally, sectoral
heterogeneity on the firm side - alongside labor force participation and short- and
long-term unemployment, suggested by Bermperoglou et al. (2013) - might be an-
other explanation of the gap between theoretical and empirical multipliers reported,
but unexplained by Monacelli et al. (2010).
The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section describes the model,
while calibration is presented in Section 3. Results appear in Section 4. Section 5
concludes, while the Appendix provides more detail on impulse response functions
and the sensitivity of the results.
2 Modeling framework
My model builds on a standard, closed-economy dynamic stochastic general equi-
librium (DSGE) framework with price stickiness (Rotemberg, 1982) and search and
matching frictions (Gertler et al., 2008 and Staehler-Thomas, 2012).
As an innovation, there is sectoral heterogeneity on the firm side, ie. family and
non-family firms are distinguished. Family firms behave differently in the labor mar-
ket than non-family firms by providing greater job security, but lower wages and less
bargaining power to their employees. As well, dynastic management of family firms
is modeled by the inclusion of an intangible capital in the family sector, following
Danthine-Jin (2007).26 The presence of the two sectors creates the possibility of
sectoral movements due to changes in relative sectoral prices and wages.
26Other examples of intangible capital include McGrattan-Prescott (2000), Ai et al. (2013),
Gourio-Rudanko (2014) or McGrattan-Prescott (2014).

where h is the external habit parameter and C

There is unemployment due to search and matching frictions, which I will describe
in more detail later on. A member of the household might work in the intermediate
family sector (LF,t
) or in the intermediate non-family sector (LNF,t
). If the household
member is not employed in any of these sectors, he/she is unemployed. I define the
beginning of period unemployment by Ut
:
Ut
= 1 - LF,t-1
- LNF,t-1
Here, I normalise the total number of labor force to one, meaning I do not take into
account labor force participation decision. 28
When working in the family or in the non-family sector, the household receives
labor income, WF,t
and WNF,t
, respectively. These are sectoral real wages, expressed
in the economy-wide price level Pt
. Labor income is taxed in both sectors by LEE,t
,
which is the sum of personal labor income tax and the employees' social security
contribution. While the social security contribution is deducted, modeling retire-
ment is beyond the scope of this paper. When unemployed, the household member
receives WU
unemployment benefit, also expressed in the economy-wide price level.
Because the household owns the firms, the household receives the dividends. The
household owns and rents physical capital to intermediate family and non-family
firms, KF,t
and KNF,t
, so he/she receives rental rate of capital, RKF,t
and RKNF,t
,
respectively. The rental rates differ in the two sectors, and are also expressed in
terms of the economy-wide price level. The household can save either in a risk-free
government bond Bt
, after which he/she gets it-1
nominal interest rate, deflated by
t
quarterly inflation rate, or she can invest into physical capital. To avoid jumps,
investment is subject to an adjustment cost following Christiano et al. (2005):
KF,t
= (1 - F
)KF,t-1
+ IF,t
-

27See, for example, Gertler et al. (2008).
28A recent example of a model with labor force participation is Bermperoglou et al. (2013).
8
Here, IF,t
denotes investment into family physical capital, F
is the family depre-
ciation rate, and IF is the investment adjustment cost related to family physical
capital. Investment adjustment cost is zero in steady state.29
The household consumes an aggregate consumption bundle Ct
, which will be
described in more detail shortly, and after her consumption she pays value-added
tax C,t
, and a lump sum tax Tt
to close the model. For simplicity, I assume that
income related to bonds or physical capital renting are not taxed. 30
Thus, the period-by-period household budget constraint is
(1 - LEE,t
) (WF,t
LF,t
+ WNF,t
LNFt
) + WU
(1 - LF,t
- LNF,t

Here, PF,t
(PNF,t
) is the price level of the goods produced in the family (non-family)
sector. As the budget constraint is expressed in terms of the aggregate price level
Pt
, the relative sectoral prices are considered regarding sectoral investments (the
same is true of final firms' profits).
The household maximises its expected discounted lifetime utility subject to its
budget constraint and the two physical capital laws of motion with respect to Bt
,
Ct
, IF,t
, INF,t
, KF,t
and KNF,t
. The household takes wages and labor as given, as
these are determined in the labor market when bargaining with intermediate firms.

Because there is a value-added tax, the current and next period tax levels affect the
intertemporal consumption choice of the household.
The family physical capital and investment decisions of the household can be
expressed by two equations, a Tobin-Q and an arbitrage condition:31

29Similarly in the non-family sector.
30A counterexample is e.g. Staehler-Thomas (2012).
31Here, I describe the family sector, the non-family sector is similar.
9
QF,t
is the price level of family physical capital, which is related to the Lagrangian
multiplier of the relevant law of motion. A Tobin-Q of a standard, one-sector model
does not contain any relative prices. However, because there are two sectors here,
the relative sectoral prices appear in the Tobin-Q. Thus, in steady state, the price
level of family physical capital is equal to the relative price of family goods, instead
of 1 of the usual one-sector framework. Furthermore, the arbitrage condition is also
affected by the sectoral price level; in steady state the rental rate of capital is thus
not equal to the real interest rate net depreciation rate, but it is also affected by the
sectoral Tobin-Q.
Finally, It
aggregate investment is defined as follows:
It

 is the share of family-firm produced goods in the consumption basket, while  is

2.2 Intermediate good producing firms and wage bargaining
In each sector, there is a continuum of intermediate goods-producing firms, which
are perfectly competitive, ie. they take prices as given. They produce goods hiring
labor (as well as the employer social security contribution LER,t
) and renting phys-
ical capital from the household. Hiring labor requires posting vacancies, which is
costly, and so induces unemployment.
10
Also, intermediate firms bargain over wages with workers. Modeling the labor
market is similar to Gertler et al. (2008) and Staehler-Thomas (2012). Based on
empirical, firm-level evidence, family firms behave differently in the labor market
than non-family firms: i) their dismissal rate is lower, ii) their workers obtain a
lower wage (in steady state) and iii) their workers have less bargaining power in
wage setting. Moreover, family firms invest in family capital, which non-family
firms do not do. This capital, an intangible one in accordance with Danthine-Jin
(2007), represents the dynastic management of family firms. At this point, I will
describe the intermediate firms in detail.32
The sectoral production functions are
Y I
F,t
= AF,t
LF
F,t
K1-F -µ
F,t-1
Kµ
OF,t-1
Y I
NF,t
= ANF,t
LNF
NF,t
K1-NF
NF,t-1
These are, for simplicity's sake, Cobb-Douglas functions with constant returns to
scale.33 F
and NF
denote labor income shares in the two sectors, respectively.
AF,t
and ANF,t
are exogenous productivity levels, which are assumed to be equal in
the steady state:
^
AF,t
= AF
^
AF,t-1
+ AF,t
^
ANF,t
= ANF
^
ANF,t-1
+ ANF,t
In the family sector the family capital, which represents dynastic management,
is denoted by KOF,t-1
. Investment in family organisational capital follows a law of
motion:
KOF,t
= (1 - OF
)KOF,t-1
+ IOF,t
-
IOF
2
IOF,t
IOF,t-1
- 1
2
IOF,t
This is similar to the physical capital law of motion described above. Nevertheless,
parameter  appears, which represents the effectiveness of family organisational in-
vestment. In the baseline scenario, this parameter is set to 1. Family organisational
investment IOF,t
is intangible, so it is not part of the final output. This creates a
trade-off, namely, investment in family capital reduces goods sold today as well as
profit today, but it increases the next period's family organisational capital stock,
thus bringing about future production and profit.
Family firms post vacancies, vF
t
. The number of new hires (matches), mF
t
, depends
on the number of vacancies posted and the number of people searching for a job,
Us
t
. Searching can be described by a matching function:
mF
t
= F,m
(Us
t
)F (vF
t
)1-F
Here, F,m
is the matching efficiency, while F
denotes the matching elasticity.
32I focus on the family sector; the non-family sector, except for the organisational capital, is
parallel.
33Following the intangible capital literature, such as McGrattan-Prescott (2010) and McGrattan-
Prescott (2014), constant returns to scale mean constant returns to scale in all production inputs,
including the intangible capital.
11
Similarly to Staehler-Thomas (2012), but in contrast to Gertler et al. (2008) I
assume that the number of people searching for a job in period t equals the number
of people who are unemployed at the end of period t - 1 (Ut
) plus the number of
people losing their job at the beginning of period t:
Us
t
= Ut
+ (1 - F )LF,t-1
+ (1 - NF )LNF,t-1
Those who are fired can immediately start to search for a new job. Firing is ex-
ogenous: the sectoral dismissal rates are F and NF . Furthermore, everyone can
search for a job in any of the sectors, not only in the sector in which one was working
previously.
Those who find a job in period t start to work immediately. The same assumption
is made by Gertler et al. (2008) and Staehler-Thomas (2012), but Bermperoglou et
al. (2013) assume that those who find a job in period t start to work in period t + 1
only. Given the above functional forms and assumptions, the family labor law of
motion is
LF,t
= F LF,t-1
+ mF
t
Finally, family vacancy filling and job finding probabilities are defined as
qF
t
=
mF
t
vF
t
pF
t
=
mF
t
Us
t
Regarding vacancy posting, F and NF denote per-vacancy costs. Total vacancy
cost is linear in the number of vacancies posted. Also, this is the only cost in
my framework. In contrast, Staehler-Thomas (2012) consider a training cost as
well. Regarding the functional form, Gertler et al. (2008) do not use a linear
function. This is because they assume nominal wage rigidity, which requires a
quadratic function. I follow most of the literature when considering a linear function.
Hence, my framework is the closest to that of Bermperoglou et al. (2013).
Intermediate profits are

Because intermediate firms are perfectly competitive, the price of goods is equal to
the real marginal cost, MCF,t
and MCNF,t
in the two sectors, respectively. Profit
equals revenue net wages and rental rate of capital. Vacancy posting costs are
deducted, as well. Because there are two sectors and the profits are expressed in
the economy-wide price level Pt
, relative sectoral prices are taken into account when
calculating total vacancy posting costs. The last term in the family profit is related
to family organisational investment. Specifically, some part of family production,
IOF,t
, is not sold in the market, but it is used by the firm itself as investment
in organisational capital to enhance future production. Because the family firm
invests in organisational capital itself, the price of investment equals the price of
goods produced.

Demand for labor, however, differs from the standard one without labor market

Y I

tal:

MCF,t+1

Y I

In contrast to the family physical capital demand, rather than the current period's
production, the next period's production is relevant. This is because the firm decides
about the next period's organisational capital today, taking this period's organisa-
tional capital as given. Also, this is the reason that both the current period's and
also the next period's capital prices appear.
Similarly to physical capital, there is also a Tobin-Q for family organisational
capital:

, the effectiveness of family organisational investment has an impact on the price
of family organisational capital. In steady state, the price of family capital is equal
to MCF

, so the higher the effectiveness of organisational investment, the lower the
price of family organisational capital. Again, the price of family capital is related to
the price of production, as the family firm sacrifices its own goods to invest in this
inheritable special knowlegde.
Intermediate firms and workers bargain over gross wages; in period t they bargain
over wages paid in period t. Bargaining happens after matching is over. My frame-
work closely follows that of Staehler-Thomas (2012). Rearranging labor demand
gives the firm value:
FF,t
= MCF,t
F
Y I
F,t
LF,t
- (1 + LER,t
)WF,t
+ Et
t,t+1
F FF,t+1
The current firm value depends on the difference between the marginal revenue of
the firm net wage (affected by employer social security contribution), while it is also
related to next period's firm value, taking into account the dismissal rate of workers.
Worker value of working in the family sector at the end of period t is equal to
the wage received by the worker in period t (affected by employee labor income
tax rate) and the discounted worker value in period t + 1. This latter is a sum of
remaining employed in the family sector with probability F , plus the value of being
unemployed at the beginning of period t + 1 with probability of losing the job:
VF,t
= (1 - LEE,t
)WF,t
+ Et
t,t+1
F VF,t+1
+ (1 - F )UVb,t+1
The value of searching for a job at the begining of period t:
UVb,t

the unemployed person finds a job in the family sector, with
probability pNF

he/she finds a job in the non-family sector, while with probability 1-
pF

at the end of period t he/she is still unemployed. Those who are unemployed
at the end of period t receive unemployment benefits from the government, and can
search again in the next period:
UVe,t
= WU
+ Et
[t,t+1
UVb,t+1
]
Workers and intermediate firms bargain over the net surplus in the two sectors
separately, family bargaining means maximizing the following expression with re-
spect to the gross wage:
max (VF,t
(WF,t
) - UVe,t
)F FF,t
(WF,t
)1-F
where F
is the bargaining powers of workers in the family sector. Optimization
implies
F (1 - LEE,t

= (1 - F )(1 + LER,t
)(VF,t
- UVe,t
)
14
2.3 Final good producing firms
Similarly to Gertler et al. (2008), in each sector there is a continuum of (0, 1)
final goods-producing firms which set final goods prices. I present the family sector
only, as the non-family sector is parallel.
Final firm s in the family sector sells Y F
F,t
(s) amount of final goods at price PF,t
(s).
Total final output is a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator (Dixit-Stiglitz, 1977) of s  (0, 1)
final goods with family markup equal to F
F -1
:
Y F
F,t
=
1
0
Y F
F,t
(s) F -1

Then, optimization yields a demand function for each final good s:
Y F
F,t
(s) =

PF,t
(s)

while the total final good price is a function of s  (0, 1) final good prices:

PF,t
(s)1- F ds

1- F
As prices are sticky, firms must pay a quadratic cost when changing prices, follow-
ing Rotemberg (1982). This cost is zero in the steady state, but around the steady
state it varies depending on the ratio of the current price level to the previous pe-
riod's price level of final firm s. Thus, the profit of final firm s expressed in PF,t
price level is

. These Philips curves are similar to the
standard Philips curve, apart from the fact that they contain relative sectoral prices.
Substituting PF,t
= Pt
and PNF,t
= Pt
(ie. ^
PFPt
= 0 and ^
PFPt
= 0) into the
sectoral Philips-curves, one can immediately see that we get back the standard
Philips curve.
2.4 Monetary authority
The central bank sets the next period's interest rate based on the current period
inflation, following a simple Taylor rule:
^
it
= 
^
t
+ i
t
where 
is the weight on inflation in the Taylor rule and i
t
is an exogenous monetary
policy shock.
2.5 Government
The government collects taxes: labor income taxes (personal labor income tax
and social security contribution of employees, and social security contribution of
employers), a value-added tax and a lump-sum tax. For purposes of simplicity,
I assume that interest income of bond holdings and income on physical capital
renting are not taxed. Taxes finance government consumption expenditure Gt
and
unemployment benefit expenditure. Revenues and expenditures are
Revt
= (LEE,t
+ LER,t
) (WF,t
LF,t
+ WNF,t
LNF,t
) + C,t
Ct
+ Tt
Expt
= Gt
+ WU
(1 - LF,t
- LNF,t
)
Then, government deficit is defined as the difference between expenditures and
revenues. The government issues bonds to finance its deficit, which are bought by
the household.
DEFt
= Expt
- Revt
DEFt
= Bt
-
1 + it-1
t
Bt-1
In order to avoid an explosive solution, there is a lump-sum tax rule which depends
on the government debt-output ratio, following Bermperoglou et al. (2013):
Tt
= T(Tt-1
)T
Bt-1
Yt
B
Y
(1-T )B
exp( T,t
)
16
Here, T
is the autocorrelation parameter, B
is the debt rule parameter representing
the sensitivity of lump-sum taxes to the government debt-output ratio and T,t
is
the shock. If the government debt to output ratio goes up compared to its steady
state value, lump-sum tax increases.
Similarly to aggregate household consumption, aggregate government consump-
tion is also a composite of goods produced by family and non-family firms:
Gt
=  1
 G

F,t
+ (1 - )1
 G

NF,t

Demand functions follow
GF,t

For purposes of simplification, the share of family goods and the elasticity of substi-
tution between family and non-family goods is the same as for household consump-
tion, so the price levels are the same, too.
Finally, there is an exogenous shock process for each tax and expenditure item:
^
LEE,t

LEE,t-1
+ LEE,t
^
LER,t

^
LER,t-1

G,t
shock error terms.
2.6 Market clearing
In equilibrium all markets clear. Physical capital markets clear, ie. physical capi-
tal supplied by the household is equal to physical capital demanded by intermediate
firms. Similarly, labor markets clear.
Also, goods markets clear. Total final output is equal to total intermediate output:
Y F
F,t
= Y I
F,t
- IOF,t
Y F
NF,t
= Y I
NF,t
Concerning family goods, family organisational investment must be subtracted from
intermediate output, as it is not distributed, but used by the firm itself. This is in
line with Danthine-Jin (2007), who point out that, from an accounting point of
view, GDP does not contain intangible investment due to the fact that it is treated
as an expense. (This is true despite the fact that from an economical point of view
it is not an expense.)
17
Also, output in each sector equals demand in each sector. Final output of family
firms is equal to the sum of household and government consumption demand, and
for physical investment demand for family firm-produced goods, too, there is a
deadweight loss related to vacancy posting and price stickiness (non-family market
clearing is similar).

3 Calibration
For the purpose of illustration, the model is calibrated to match data of those
European countries with an above-average share of family firms in employment. The
share of family firms in the labor force is 56.4 percent (Table 1) and the share of
family firm produced goods in the household and government consumption basket
is 0.6 based on Mandl (2008). The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent, based on
Eurostat data between 2000 and 2012 (Table 2).
The discount rate  is set to 0.99, which is a standard value in the literature. The
steady-state quarterly rate of inflation is 0. Price markups are 10 percent in both
sectors, and all the quarterly depreciation rates are 2.5 percent, following standard
values in the literature. Family and non-family labor income shares are set to the
common value of 0.7. The price elasticity of demand is assumed to be 1.5.
Both productivity levels are normalised to 1. There is no consensus in the corpo-
rate finance literature as to whether family firms are more or less productive than
non-family firms34. For simplicity's sake, then, I consider the same levels, and after
which I check the sensitivity of the results with respect to this.
The effectiveness of family organisational investment is 1, which, following McGrattan-
Prescott (2010), assumes that the accumulation process of intangible capital is the
same as the usual accumulation process of physical capital. The sensitivity of the
results with respect to this parameter is also examined later on.
The steady-state ratio of household consumption to GDP is 59.1 percent, based
on Eurostat data of euro-area countries between 2000 and 2012.35 The steady-state
deficit to GDP ratio is 3 percent pursuant to the Maastrict Treaty. The steady-state
value of the effective value-added tax rate is 12.4 percent, following the OECD and
taking into account the great ratio of household consumption to GDP. Then, the
steady state effective labor income tax rate of employees is 28.8 percent (including

35When calculating this ratio, GDP was modified by net exports and government investment,
as my model is a closed economy and does not contain public investment.

personal labor income tax and social security contribution of employees), while the
employer social security contribution rate is 24.2 percent.36 These tax rates are
similar to those of Staehler-Thomas (2012).37
The gross steady-state replacement rate of unemployment benefit is 28 percent,
following the OECD.38 For this parameter, there is a wide range of values in the
literature. The implied value of Monacelli et al. (2010) is only slightly above 10
percent, but Christoffel et al. (2009) set this rate to 65 percent, while Esser et al.
(2009) suggest 50 percent. The most common value is around 0.3-0.4; usually, a
lower value is considered for the US than for the euro area.39
Dynastic management, modeled by an intangible capital, connotes firm knowledge
about customers, but also about suppliers. It is a latent variable that is difficult
to measure, and I am unaware of any empirical estimates. Gourio-Rudanko (2014)
claim that about 11 percent of employment is related to sales. They consider a
similar value to calibrate the weight of customer capital, an intangible capital, rep-
resenting the relationship between firms and customers. By assumption, I calibrate
the level of organisational to physical capital in the family sector to 11 percent, fol-
lowing Gourio-Rudanko (2014). I know that, by doing this, the relationship between
the firm and its suppliers is not captured, and that the importance of family capital
might therefore be even higher. Thus, I check the sensitivity of the results.
Also, I am unaware of any information concerning the ratio of sectoral price levels
either. Nevertheless, Bassanini et al. (2011) find that the family wage is 5 percent
lower than the non-family wage. Hence, I consider a similar gap between the sectoral
price levels. Sraer-Thesmar (2007) find a similar wage penalty, about 4.5 percent,
even though they did not consider non-listed companies as did Bassanini et al.
(2011).
Bassanini et al. (2011) is the sole paper that estimates dismissal rates. They
find that the dismissal rate of family firms is 0.16 percentage points lower than the
dismissal rate of non-family firms. Dismissal rates in the literature vary between 1.8
percent of Bermperoglou et al. (2013), which is close to the estimated separation
rates of Hobijn-Sahin (2007), and the 10.5 percent of Gertler et al. (2008), which is
similar to the 8-10 percent reported by Hall (1995). I set the non-family dismissal
rate to 6 percent, which is the middle point, following Staehler-Thomas (2012), and
the family dismissal rate to 5.84 percent, taking into account the above-described
finding of Bassanini et al. (2011).
36These effective tax rates are based on OECD data between 2000 and 2012.
37Other papers usually consider only a lump sum tax, apart from Bermperoglou et al. (2013).
38The gross replacement rate of unemployment benefit is also based on euro-area data between
2000 and 2012.
39It is not straightforward matter, however, how to compare the replacement rates, as some
models only contain a lump-sum tax. This means that there is no clear distinction between gross
and net wages and, thus, between gross and net unemployment benefit replacement rates.
19
Table 3: Steady state parameters

Bassanini et al. (2011) also show evidence that the bargaining power of workers,
ie. the importance of unions, is higher in the non-family sector, 0.807, compared
to the family sector, where it is only 0.495. Hosios (1990) claims that an efficient
solution requires that the bargaining power of workers is equal to the matching
elasticity in the matching function; therefore, I set the sectoral matching elasticities
accordingly. My non-family bargaining power is higher than the usual values of
0.3-0.5 found in the literature (Mortensen-Nagypal, 2007), apart from Gertler et
al. (2008) who estimate a value of slightly more than 0.9. Most papers, following
Hosios (1990), set the matching elasticity equal to the bargaining power of workers,
except Gertler et al. (2008) who calibrate the matching elasticity to 0.5. Moreover,
Christoffel et al. (2009) consider a somewhat higher matching elasticity than their
bargaining power of workers (0.6 and 0.5, respectively).
Similarly to the dismissal rates, there is a wide range of values found in the
literature regarding the ratios of vacancy costs to wages. Bruckner-Pappa (2012)
and Bermperoglou et al. (2013) use a value of 4.5 percent following Hagedorn-
Manovski (2008). But others, such as Christoffel et al. (2009) and Staehler-Thomas
(2012), consider higher values, around 6-7 percents, while the highest value is used
by Gertler et al. (2008), almost 9 percent. I calibrate these ratios to 7 percent in
both sectors, which is in the middle of the range in the literature.
My calibration implies that the job-finding rates are 22.4 and 17.8 percent in
the family and non-family sectors, respectively. This is in line with unemployment
duration in the euro area. According to the Eurostat, between 2000 and 2012 about
22.7 percent of unemployed people found a job within one to two months, while
about 37.5 percent found a job in less than five months. My values are also similar
to those of Christoffel et al. (2009) and Staehler-Thomas (2012). Nevertheless, the
values considered for the US are usually higher, 45 percent in Shimer (2005), and
83 percent in Bermperoglou et al. (2013) and in Bruckner-Pappa (2012).
As regards the job-filling probabilities, my values are lower than those in the
literature: 15.4 and 9.9 percent in the family and non-family sectors, respectively.
For the US, Bermperoglou et al. (2013) and Bruckner-Pappa (2012) consider 2
3
, while
for the euro area, Christoffel et al. (2012) and Staehler-Thomas (2012) use 0.7. The
reason for this is that in my model, unlike in others, the job-filling probability is
linearly and positively related to the vacancy cost.40 Thus, there is a trade-off in
setting both the vacancy cost and the job-filling probability close to values in the
literature. I calibrated my model such that the vacancy-posting cost is as similar
as possible to other values in the literature, at the cost of accepting lower job-filling
probability rates.
Finally, the implied share of total vacancy costs in GDP is 1.7 percent, while
the matching efficiencies are 0.186 and 0.159 in the family and non-family sectors,
respectively.
40See the first-order conditions with respect to the number of posted vacancies in Section 2.

Regarding the dynamic parameters, the relative risk aversion is 1.38 and the
external habit in consumption is 0.71, following Smets-Wouters (2007). Also, based
on Smets-Wouters (2007), the inflation weight in the Taylor rule is 2.04 and the
sectoral price rigidity is 66 percent.41 The debt sensitivity parameter in the lump
sum tax rule is set to 2 following Bermperoglou et al. (2013). Furthermore, based on
Christiano et al. (2005), all investment adjustment costs are 2.48. As an assumption,
all the shock autocorrelation parameters are 0.75.

After calibrating the model, it is loglinearised and solved by Dynare 4.4.2.
4 Results
4.1 Baseline results
Four stochastic fiscal austerity shocks are considered, all of them are 1 percent of
GDP size: i) a decrease in government consumption, ii) an increase in the rate of
value-added tax, iii) an increase in employees' labor income tax rate (personal labor
income tax and social security contribution) and iv) an increase in employer social
security contribution.
Table 5 shows the unemployment multipliers: i) at peak and ii) cumulatively. A
peak multiplier is the largest response after the shock, while the cumulative multi-
pliers are the sum of the multipliers in the first one, two and four years, respectively.
All multipliers are presented in percentage point deviations from the steady state.
Also, Figure 2 presents stochastic impulse response functions of the consumption
tax shock; those of other shocks are shown in Figures 3-5 of the Appendix.
41Because my model contains Rotemberg price rigidity, and not Calvo price rigidity, Lombardo-
Vestin (2007)'s approach is adopted for calculating the Rotemberg parameters in line with the
Calvo ones.
22
Table 5: Unemployment fiscal multipliers (in percentage points)
I can conclude that fiscal consolidation raises unemployment. At peak, the highest
increase, 0.52 percentage points, is implied by a cut in government consumption. At
peak, both labor income tax hikes induce a lower increase in unemployment than
a government consumption cut does, 0.12 and 0.07 percentage points, respectively.
The hike in value added tax is the least costly in terms of employment; at peak it
raises unemployment by only 0.02 percentage points.
Nevertheless, the cumulative multipliers show a somewhat different picture. On
the whole, during the four years, the cut in government consumption and the increase
in the employees' labor income tax cause the highest and almost the same level of
increase in unemployment: 0.48 and 0.51 percentage points, respectively. At the
same time, over a shorter time horizon, the government consumption multiplier
still exceeds any other multiplier. Again, an increase in the employer social security
contribution is less harmful for employment than an increase in the employees' labor
income tax. Cumulatively, also, consolidating the budget by increasing the value
added tax revenue is least costly in terms of employment.
Regarding the economic driving forces behind my results, the consumption tax
rate directly affects the price of consumption, so as demand goes down a higher
consumption tax rate implies a decline in consumption. Employment is less affected
as investment goes up, which means that total demand (output) does not signifi-
cantly change. As for the cut in government consumption, even though household
consumption and investment increase, total demand (output) considerably declines.
In spite of the lower wages, firms, therefore decrease employment owing to a lower
demand for labor. At the same time, concerning the labor income tax shocks, the
main driving force is related to wage bargaining. The increase in employees' labor
income tax implies a decline in worker values, which means being employed becomes
less favourable than the outside option (unemployment benefit). The increase in the
employer social security contribution rate has a negative effect on the firm values,
however. The fact that increasing the employees' labor income tax is more harmful
for employment than increasing the employer social security contribution highlights
the relatively more important role of worker values. Moreover, the greater the bar-
gaining power of workers, the more truth there is to this claim.
23
Figure 2: An increase in value added tax revenue equal to 1 percent of GDP
Thus, my results suggest that, if the aim of the government is to consolidate the
budget at the lowest price in terms of employment, an increase in value-added tax
should be implemented. Moreover, a cut in government consumption usually implies
a higher increase in unemployment than do labor income tax hikes, and an increase
in employees' labor income tax is more harmful for employment than increasing the
employers' social security contribution rate.
With regard to the existing literature, my qualitative results are in line with
studies that suggest that tightening fiscal policy on the expenditure side increases
unemployment. As regards the size of the unemployment multiplier of government
24
consumption, it is close to Monacelli et al. (2010). Further, my results are con-
sistent with Ball et al. (2013), who show that spending-based adjustments have
a more pronounced effect on unemployment than tax-based adjustments (only at
peak, however). Nonetheless, as they employ a narrative approach, they are unable
to compare different tax policies. Thus, another main contribution of this paper is
estimating, for the first time, the tax-side unemployment multipliers.
Nevertheless, unemployment is clearly not the sole concern of the government.
Regarding output, all policies, apart from the value-added tax policy, induce a de-
cline in output. The largest decline occurs after a cut in government consumption;
output goes down on impact by more than 0.4 percent. Also, not only the reaction
of GDP, but also that of household consumption is important. The only policy that
raises household consumption is a cut in government consumption (household con-
sumption goes up by more than 0.9 percent at peak). At the same time, household
consumption goes down considerably when the rate of value-added tax is increased
(at peak by 0.25 percent). Hence, there are trade-offs a policymaker must consider.
Combining policies might be a way to manage these trade-offs. Given the debate
on shifting the focus of taxation from labor income toward value-added taxes, I
have had a look at two combined policies, namely, an increase of 1 percent of GDP
in revenue from value-added tax, and the same size of decrease in the employees'
or employers' labor income tax revenue, keeping the budget deficit unchanged.42
These combined policies induce a 0.1 and a 0.05 percentage points decline in un-
employment, respectively at peak. At the same time, household consumption goes
down somewhat less than after an increase in value-added tax, and output goes up
compared to a decline following the hikes in labor income tax.
4.2 The role of sectoral heterogeneity
Sectoral heterogeneity on the firm side - besides labor force participation and
short- and long-term unemployment suggested by Bermperoglou et al. (2013) -
might be another way to explain the gap between theoretical and empirical multi-
pliers reported but unexplained by Monacelli et al. (2010). In this section, three
alternative scenarios are compared to the baseline scenario: i) the only sector is
the family sector, ii) the only sector is the non-family sector, iii) and a two-sectoral
framework without family capital; the model closest to the literature is the one with
only a non-family sector.
First, the volatility of unemployment is significantly lower in a one-sector model,
and also without the inclusion of organisational capital compared with the baseline
two-sector model.43 This is related to fact that, in a two-sector model, the presence
of the two sectors creates the possibility of sectoral movements due to changes in
relative sectoral prices and wages.
42Impulse responses are presented in Figures 6-7 of the Appendix.
43The volatility of unemployment is 2.9 if only family firms are considered, 3.3 if only non-family
firms are considered, and 4.3 if organisational capital is not considered, compared to the baseline
value of 8.7.
25
Table 6: Unemployment fiscal multipliers and sectoral heterogeneity (in percentage points)
26
Second, sectoral heterogeneity seems to play a crucial role (Table 6)44; unemploy-
ment multipliers are very different with and without it. When homogeneous firms
are considered, multipliers of labor income tax policies and government consumption
multipliers are usually biased downwards, while the consumption tax multipliers are
often biased upwards. Comparing the baseline multipliers to those of the alternative
scnearios, one can conclude that about half of the difference is due to the number
of sectors, and the other half is related to the inclusion of intangible capital.
4.3 Robustness with respect to parameter values
Tables 8 and 9 of the Appendix show multipliers with different parameter val-
ues. We can conclude that the sign of the multipliers is always robust, while their
magnitude is also highly robust. The main exception is the degree of price rigid-
ity, which significantly affects the magnitude of the government consumption and
the value-added tax multipliers. In some cases, multipliers are also sensitive to the
unemployment benefit replacement ratio and the dismissal rate.
There is no evidence in the literature as to whether family or non-family firms
set prices more often. At the same time, Goldberg-Hellerstein (2011) show that
small firms set prices more often than large firms, and Bach (2010) claims that
family firms are usually smaller than non-family firms. I consider therefore an
alternative scenario in which family firms set prices more often than do non-family
firms, while in the baseline scenario the sectoral price rigidities were equal. When
70 percent of family firms do not set prices compared to the baseline 66 percent,
the government consumption multiplier, at peak, goes up to 0.67 percentage points
(other multipliers do not change significantly). Concerning cumulative multipliers,
both the government consumption multiplier and the consumption tax multiplier
increase considerably. Still, the main policy conclusions remain the same. The
importance of the degree of price rigidity for unemployment fiscal multipliers was
also highlighted by Bruckner-Pappa (2012), stressing the role of the demand effect.45
Regarding the unemployment benefit replacement rate, there is a wide range of
values in the literature, which was summarised in Section 3. As already pointed out
by Gertler et al. (2008), this ratio is crucial for the impulse responses of a model
with search and matching frictions. When decreasing this rate, at peak, unemploy-
ment increases less after a cut in government consumption. This might be because
a lower replacement rate means a lower outside option, so that being unemployed
becomes relatively less attractive. Cumulatively, not only the government consump-
tion multiplier, but also the employees' labor income tax multipliers are affected,
albeit to a lesser extent. Similar findings hold for the dismissal rates.
44See also Figure 8 of the Appendix.
45Generally, Woodford (2011) points out that sticky prices imply a larger output government
expenditure multiplier.
27
5 Conclusion and discussion
The aim of this paper was to estimate unemployment multipliers of expenditure
and revenue-side fiscal austerity policies. My research contributes to the body of
knowledge as there is a debate on both the sign and the size of the unemployment
multipliers of government expenditure items. Moreover to the best of my knowledge,
this is the first paper to estimate unemployment multipliers of tax policies.
My model was based on a standard, closed-economy DSGE framework with sticky
prices and search and matching frictions, and as a novelty, on the firm side there was
a distinction between family and non-family firms. Sectoral heterogeneity has not yet
been taken into account in the unemployment fiscal multiplier literature, although
firms are obviously not homogeneous. Family firms employ a notable share of the
labor force in Europe, and the differently managed family and non-family firms
behave very differently in the labor market. The model was calibrated to match
data of European countries with a large percentage of family firms in employment,
while the characteristics of family firms were based on empirical, micro-level evidence
documented in the corporate finance literature.
My model predicts that fiscal austerity raises unemployment. At peak, the highest
increase in unemployment is implied by a cut in government consumption. Never-
theless, a hike in employees' labor income tax, cumulatively, implies the same size
of increase in unemployment as does the government consumption cut. A higher
employer social security contribution is less costly in terms employment than an
increase of the same size in employees' labor income tax, however. Both at peak
and cumulatively, unemployment reacts least when the budget is consolidated by
increasing the rate of value-added tax. Nonetheless, a policymaker will need to deal
with trade-offs, as the increase in value-added tax results in the highest decline in
consumption.
Sectoral heterogeneity seems to play a crucial role: unemployment fiscal multipli-
ers are very different with and without it. When homogeneous firms are considered,
multipliers of labor income tax policies and government consumption multipliers are
usually biased downwards, while the consumption tax multipliers are often biased
upwards. Ignoring sectoral heterogeneity might lead, then, to incorrect policy con-
clusions, although, according to my results budget consolidation is always the least
harmful for employment when done through increasing consumption tax revenue.
Regarding the existing literature, my results are qualitatively in line with those
who suggest that tightening fiscal policy on the expenditure side increases unem-
ployment. As regards the size of the unemployment multiplier of government con-
sumption, it is close to Monacelli et al. (2010). Furthermore, my results are con-
sistent with Ball et al. (2013), who show that spending-based adjustments have
a more pronounced effect on unemployment than tax-based adjustments (only at
peak, though). Because they use a narrative approach, however, they are unable to
compare different tax policies. Thus, another main contribution made by this paper
is estimating, for the first time, the tax-side unemployment multipliers. Finally, sec-
toral heterogeneity on the firm side - besides labor force participation and short- and
28
long-term unemployment suggested by Bermperoglou et al. (2013) - might be an-
other explanation of the gap between theoretical and empirical multipliers reported
but unexplained by Monacelli et al. (2010).
Does this mean that the government should consolidate the budget by increasing
the role of consumption taxation? This depends on the goals of the government,
and how each goal is weighted. Clearly, increasing the rate of value-added tax is
least costly in terms of employment, at any time-horizon considered. However, there
are trade-offs. In particular, household consumption declines considerably after this
policy is implemented, and, actually, this policy is the most harmful for household
consumption. Should the government care more about the number of unemployed
or about the amount of consumption of society as a whole? This raises further
questions. First, does inequality increase more when more people are unemployed,
or does inequality increase more when household consumption declines more? In-
equality is related to the progressivity of the tax system, which usually decreases
inequality, and while labor income taxation is often progressive, consumption taxa-
tion is always regressive. A drawback of my modeling framework is that - due to the
representative agent assumption - no inequality measure can be defined, leaving me
unable to answer these important questions. Second, do we think that, as time goes
by, it is more difficult to leave unemployment? If so, then the less time that passes
since losing a job, the higher the probability of finding another one. In this case,
a decline in consumption might be less harmful than an increase in unemployment
from a longer-term point of view.
Similarly, there are some other features that were beyond the scope of this paper.
First, although firms were not homogeneous in my model, workers were. Now, un-
employment is due to search and matching frictions only, but if skill heterogeneity
was present, a skill mismatch between workers and firms would be an additional
reason for unemployment. The inclusion of this channel would enlarge the role and
importance of education policies, too. Second, although social security contribu-
tions were deducted from gross wages, a detailed modeling of the social security
system was not the aim of this paper. This would require overlapping generations
in the framework, i.e. a distinction between young and old households. Such an
extension might be relevant, however, when studying the differences between the
impacts of employees' and employers' social security contribution hikes. Finally, a
significant part of output and employment is 'in the shadow' (Schneider et al., 2010
and Schneider, 2012), which cannot be directly influenced by the government. If
family firms tend to be more in the shadow (do they?), then they might be relatively
less affected by any government policy. This is another consideration in the design
of prudent governmental policies.
As I pointed out earlier, sectoral heterogeneity on the firm side has not been con-
sidered before in the unemployment fiscal multiplier literature. Did we find evidence
of its importance in this paper? I think we did, and we can conclude that sectoral
heterogeneity, and a distinction between family and non-family firms, in particu-
lar, has a crucial role concerning the magnitude of unemployment fiscal multipli-
ers. These multipliers are very different with and without sectoral heterogeneity.
Multipliers of labor income tax policies are usually biased downwards, while the
29
consumption tax multipliers are often biased upwards with a representative firm.
Ignoring sectoral heterogeneity might lead, then, to incorrect policy conclusions.
Here we are not concerned with determining the "best" fiscal austerity policy for
employment, which, according to my results, is always an increase in consumption
tax, but rather, with regard to the relative employment cost of the "second-best"
policies. The latter are clearly more harmful for employment, although they might
have other advantages (e.g. a smaller decline or an increase in household consump-
tion). And, as we discussed above, even though an increase in value-added tax is
least harmful for employment, a government might want to adopt a different policy
if it has, at least in part, different priorities. In such cases, it is very important to
know the precise cost of such a policy.
Concerning the role of family capital, which is one side of the sectoral heterogene-
ity story, we can conclude that, comparing our baseline multipliers to alternative
multipliers, about half of the difference between the one- and two-sectoral multipli-
ers was due to the sectoral heterogeneity itself (ie. the number of sectors). The other
half was attributable, however, to the inclusion of intangible capital in the family
sector, nonetheless, our main conclusions remain the same. The results should be
treated with a degree of caution, however, because dynastic management is a latent
variable that is difficult to measure.

functions. The solid line is the baseline model. The dotted line is a one-sector model
assuming that all firms are family firms, while the line with round markers is another
one-sector model where all firms are non-family firms. The line with squared markers
is a two-sector model without organisational capital in the family sector.46 Tables

i) the unemployment benefit replacement rate, ii) the bargaining power of workers
in the non-family sector, iii) the dismissal rate of workers in the family sector, iv)
family productivity level, v) effectiveness of family organisational investment and
vi) the level of price rigidity in the family sector.
