Introduction
In Ecuador, a new political party called the Living Well
Movement (Movimiento Vivir Bien) recently began contest-
ing elections in the province of Imbabura (La Hora, 2013).
The party grew in popularity due to its critique of President
Correa's `good living' (or `buen vivir') environmental pol-
icy, which has promoted ­ rather than hindered ­ mining
efforts in one of the world's most unique ecosystems: the
IntagValley,locatedintheheartoftheprovince(CODELCO
out of Intag, 2015). Ultimately, the party, which represents
poor subsistence farmers, ran in three mayoral contests in
February 2014, and won two of them, including that of
Cotacachi, Ecuador's third largest city. Subnational elec-
tions are often the entry point to politics for new parties
such as Living Well, which have specific local interests.
However, with both their electoral success and their mes-
sage, Living Well garnered the attention of national parties
as well as that of the national media (El Norte EC, 2013).
Currently, Ecuador does not have a nationwide party
focused exclusively on `green' issues (Eisenstadt and West
[no date]) but, with its success, Living Well is a contender
to fill that vacuum. Can we expect parties like Living Well
to also participate in national politics? More generally, to
what extent does the experience of a party in subnational
races predict its decision to enter national elections?
Investigating how geographic subunits structure national
political competition has captured the attention of scholars
at least since Schattschneider (1960) recognized the lure of
local politics for members of the US Congress. Although
there is a growing body of literature on party system nation-
alization, few investigations have focused on how nation-
alization occurs specifically in presidential systems

Abstract
Do parties' experiences in subnational elections predict when parties enter national competition and compete for
the presidency? Building upon the party nationalization literature, we argue that a party's presence in elections across
subnational units and its subsequent performance in these elections are determining factors for whether it enters the
presidential race. To conduct our analysis, we have assembled an original dataset on parties' presence and performance
in subnational elections and presidential entry in 17 countries in Europe and Latin America from 1990 to 2013. We
find that a party's presence and performance in subnational elections are significant predictors of its decision to run for
president, even when the party ran in the previous election and when the elections are concurrent. These findings have
important implications for understanding how subnational elections relate to national party systems and democratic
representation, more generally.

Stoll, 2008; Morgenstern et al., 2009), and even fewer have
focused on the influence of subnational elections in the
nationalization process (Harbers, 2010; Jones, 1995;
Moreno, 2003; Samuels, 2003). Furthermore, the studies
that do investigate the influence of subnational races exam-
ine how they affect national legislative politics rather than
presidential contests. Yet, both in theory and in practice,
subnational politics have the potential to be significant pre-
dictors of parties' presidential strategies. This article fills
this gap in the literature by explicitly theorizing and analyz-
ing the connection between parties' presence and perfor-
mance in subnational elections and their decision to enter
the presidential election.
To investigate the connection between subnational elec-
tions and the presidential race, we have assembled an origi-
nal dataset that includes electoral results for all parties in
the highest level of subnational races (governorships or
subnational legislative bodies) for 17 countries in Europe
and Latin America from 1990 to 2013. We then identify
whether those parties ran their own candidates for president
in the concurrent or subsequent presidential election. By
focusing on subnational elections at the level of the indi-
vidual party, we are able to explicitly model how parties'
subnational electoral presence and performance predict
their approach to one of the most significant national-level
elections ­ the presidency.
Subnational presence, performance,
and presidential elections
There are strong theoretical rationales for why subnational
elections should predict parties'decisions to enter the presi-
dential race. A party's subnational presence is the extent to
which it contests subnational elections within a country.
Some political parties have high presence in subnational
elections, competing for governorships or regional legisla-
tures in nearly every subnational unit. However, as the
Living Well example demonstrates, regional concerns can
drive both candidate and voter behavior in subnational
races. Candidates may form their own regionally-focused
party to address local concerns that have been neglected by
national parties. This is often in response to voters who
express preferences that are dominated by such local con-
cerns. Because subnational offices are the most appropriate
venue for affecting local policy, in addition to being the
most accessible for regional parties to win, we would
expect regional parties to be especially likely to emerge to
contest subnational elections. Empirically, this expectation
is demonstrated in our sample (see Figure 1).
However, elections can be considered to function as
`economies of scale' for political parties ­ the more elec-
tions in which a party becomes involved, even if they are
not at the same time, the less costly each election is because
parties will have already built up the necessary resources
and organizational strength to run a campaign. Given the
nationwide scale of the race, presidential elections tend to
require organizational presence across the country. In addi-
tion, presidential candidates benefit from having regional
bases of support among constituents who can contribute
valuable resources to the campaign ­ time, money, and,
most importantly, votes. A regional party that contests sub-
national elections in fewer than a quarter of a country's sub-
national units likely does not have the organizational
support or resources to finance a nationwide campaign
required to contest the presidency. However, as a party's
subnational presence increases, so too should its organiza-
tional capacity, which suggests that a more national pres-
ence is a good predictor that a party will contest the
presidency. This leads to our first hypothesis:
H1: Parties that have a larger presence in subnational
races ­ i.e. run for office in more of their country's sub-
national units ­ will be more likely to run a candidate for
president.
It is not, moreover, merely participating in subnational
elections that may predict when parties enter presidential
elections. Subnational performance, or the average vote
share that a party receives in elections for governor or
regional legislatures, should also affect a party's decision to
enter the presidential race. Similar to subnational presence,
greater subnational performance indicates that a party has
the organizational capacity and voter support needed to
launch a national campaign for the presidency. However,
there is another mechanism at work that connects subna-
tional performance with entry in presidential contests, and
that is the introduction of influential new members to the
political party. Indeed, research on individual parties has
illustrated how strong performance in subnational elections

may help predict a party's national political strategy. For
example, Samuels (2004) shows that the Brazilian Workers'
Party's success in state and municipal elections introduced
more moderates to the party, which ultimately led the party
to transition from being a radical niche party to a main-
stream political competitor that eventually won the presi-
dency. Other scholars have attributed the national-level
success of `New Left' parties in Latin America to their
achievement in subnational governments. In particular,
control of municipal governments gave left parties an
opportunity to solidify their organization and support bases,
gain experience, and establish reputations for administra-
tive competence that was crucial for their ability to launch
and win presidential contests across the region (Chávez and
Goldfrank, 2004; Levitsky and Roberts, 2012: 9).
In sum, greater subnational performance means that
there are new politicians joining the party label to compete
for governorships and regional legislatures and that they
are enjoying some success. Such success indicates that
these politicians are likely pragmatic ­ able to adjust their
political strategy to gain votes ­ and are also likely to be
more moderate ­ or at least appeal to the median voter
within their particular region. This influx of relatively pow-
erful new party members is likely to influence the party's
national electoral strategy towards increasing the party's
office-holding opportunities and towards engaging in polit-
ical competition for higher-level offices. Given these pos-
sible influences, we argue that, like subnational presence,
subnational performance is also a good predictor of when
parties enter the presidential race. This leads to our second
hypothesis:
H2: Parties that have greater performance in subnational
races ­ i.e. stronger bases of support and greater elec-
toral success across subnational units ­ will be more
likely to run a candidate for president.
Our argument focuses explicitly on how greater experi-
ence in subnational elections is a predictor of parties' deci-
sions to enter the presidential race. We argue that
subnational elections are strong predictors of presidential
entry even when parties compete for the presidency for
other reasons ­ either to gain office or earn credibility as
coalition-partners and policy advocates (West and Spoon,
2013) ­ and then supplement their presidential campaign
by competing for subnational office. Parties are more
likely to treat subnational elections as complements to the
presidential race under two conditions: 1) the party already
has strong organizational capacity across the subnational
units; and 2) the party believes that it can benefit from
expending valuable resources to compete for subnational
office. The first condition is met if the party competed for
the presidency in the previous election; it would then have
the nationwide capacity to launch a presidential campaign
regardless of its participation in subnational elections. The
second condition exists primarily if the presidential elec-
tion is concurrent with subnational elections. In concurrent
elections, entering subnational races does not necessarily
require the launching of separate campaigns as much as it
requires adding to the existing national campaign.
Furthermore, given the power of the coattails effect of
presidential elections in concurrent election cycles, parties
can expect to be more successful in subnational races when
they are simultaneously competing for the presidency
(Golder, 2006; Shugart 1995). Therefore, even under these
conditions, parties' subnational experience still serves as a
strong predictor of their presidential entry decisions.1 Our
third hypothesis is thus:
H3: Parties that have greater performance and presence
in subnational races will be more likely to run a candi-
date for president even when elections are concurrent
and the party previously contested the presidency.
Data and methods
To test our hypotheses on how subnational elections predict
presidential entry strategies, we compare party behavior in
17 countries in Europe and Latin America, of which 7 are in
Europe and 10 are in Latin America.2 All of these countries
have a directly elected president. The European countries
are semi-presidential (as defined by Elgie (1999)) and the
Latin American countries are presidential. Our original
dataset covers the period 1990­2013 and includes 57 sub-
national elections. The subnational units are those that have
been identified as having a significant level of both shared
and self-rule in the Regional Authority Index (RAI)
(Hooghe et al., 2008) for the countries included and by our
own assessment based on the RAI criteria (for the Latin
American cases), as well as whether they held subnational
elections. These subnational units vary from municipalities
(e.g. Finland), to counties (e.g. Romania and Croatia),
departments (e.g. Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay), regions
(e.g. France), and states (e.g. Austria, Brazil, and
Venezuela). If a country has subnational executive elec-
tions, we included those results, and if the country only has
elections to a subnational legislative body we included
those. Of the 57 elections, 34 are for subnational executives
and 23 are for subnational legislative bodies. Our unit of
analysis is the political party in the subnational election.
Our dataset includes all parties that ran in more than one
subnational unit, as well as parties that only ran in one sub-
national unit, but won the election in that unit. This results
in a total of 1036 party observations.
Similar to West and Spoon (2013), our dependent vari-
able is a binary variable indicating whether a party runs a
candidate in the concurrent or subsequent presidential elec-
tion, coded 1 if so and 0 if not. Because we are focused on
4 Research and Politics 
how participation in subnational elections influences presi-
dential entry, parties that do not compete in subnational
elections are not included in the dataset. In the coding of
our variable, we follow Spoon and West (2015) and define
running for president as cases where parties nominate one
of their own party leaders as a presidential candidate. We
did not consider parties joining a pre-electoral coalition to
support the candidate of another party as running a candi-
date for president.3 Of the 1036 party observations in our
dataset, 296 (28.6%) ran in a presidential election.
Our key independent variables relate to the party's pres-
ence and performance in the subnational elections either
preceding or at the same time as the presidential election.
First, we account for the presence of the party in subna-
tional elections by including a variable that measures the
percentage of subnational units in which the party ran.
Although the mean value for presence is 37.6%, nearly half
of our observations are less than or equal to 20%, and one-
fifth of our observations are greater than or equal to 80%.
Thus, nearly 70% of the parties in our dataset can either be
considered to be regional parties, which have concentrated
their subnational efforts, or large nationalized parties that
are contesting almost all subnational elections. The distri-
bution of the presence variable is illustrated in Figure 1.
Second, we measure the party's performance by using its
average vote share in each subnational election across all
subnational units.4 The mean value of performance is 6.5%.
To test our third hypothesis ­ that a party's subnational
presence and performance are predictors of running for
president regardless of election timing or running in the
previous presidential election ­ we include several interac-
tion terms. First, we interact both the presence and perfor-
mance variables with a dichotomous variable for whether
the subnational and presidential elections were concurrent.
When subnational elections are not all on the same date
(e.g. in Argentina and Austria), we code it as concurrent if
a majority of the elections are on the same date as the presi-
dential election and as non-concurrent if the majority of
elections are not. Second, we interact both variables with
the lagged dependent variable, which indicates whether a
party ran a candidate for president in the previous presiden-
tial election.
We also incorporate several control variables in our
analysis. First, we include a variable that measures the per-
centage of subnational elections won by a political party.
Second, we include a dichotomous variable that accounts
for whether the party ran in the most populous subnational
entity.5 We expect winning more subnational offices and
competing in the most populous unit to positively influ-
ence a party's likelihood of running a candidate for presi-
dent. Third, we control for the type of subnational election
with an executive variable, which is coded as 1 for an exec-
utive election and 0 for a legislative election. We posit that
running in a subnational executive election will provide
parties with the executive experience necessary to then
successfully contest the presidency. Among the countries
in our dataset, we have eight countries that have executive
elections and six that have legislative elections. Fourth, we
include a dichotomous variable for whether a state is fed-
eral. Following the argument that when parties gain access
to local office, especially when it is relatively powerful,
they may be less likely to expend resources in national
elections (Chhibber and Kollman, 1998, 2004; Harbers,
2010; Samuels, 2003), we posit that parties may be less
likely to run presidential candidates in federal systems.6
Fifth, we utilize a dichotomous variable to account for the
electoral rules used in the presidential election. Following
Amorim Neto and Cox (1997), Jones (1999, 2004), and
Golder (2006), we argue that parties are less likely to run
presidential candidates in plurality systems. Sixth, to
account for the consolidation of democratic institutions,
we include a democracy control. We posit that, when the
party system is more democratic, parties will be more
likely to enter the presidential race, given that competition
is more fair and open. To measure democracy, we use the
country's Freedom House (2015) scores for the year of the
subnational election. We add the political rights and civil
liberties scores and then take the inverse, so that higher
values indicate more democratic countries. Finally, we
include a time component by controlling for whether the
party ran in the previous presidential election by lagging
the dependent variable. See Appendix 1 for the descriptive
statistics of all of the variables included in our analysis.
To determine the probability of a party entering the pres-
idential race, we use a logistic model and cluster the stand-
ard errors by country­year. We use this technique because
the party-level observations in each country for a given
subnational election are not independent.
Results
Table 1 presents the results from our logistic regression
analysis. Model 1 demonstrates support for our first two
hypotheses. A party's presence across geographic subna-
tional units (H1) and its performance subnational elections
(H2) are significant predictors of its likelihood of running a
presidential candidate. Thus, parties that are more national-
ized, i.e. run in more subnational races, and that perform
better in subnational elections are also more likely to enter
the presidential race.
To show the substantive effect of our results, we simu-
late predicted probabilities. Figure 2 plots the probability
of entering the presidential race across the range of pres-
ence (Figure 2(a)) and the range of performance (Figure
2(b)). The dashed lines are the 95% confidence intervals
and the tick marks on the bottom of the figures indicate
the distribution of the presence and performance varia-
bles. Figure 2(a) demonstrates a strong relationship
between subnational presence and presidential entry
across the distribution of presence. The more subnational
Spoon and West 5
races a party contests, the more likely it is to run a presi-
dential candidate. Holding all variables at their means, a
party has a 22.5% probability of entering the presidential
race. For a more regional party that only contests 10% of
subnational races, the probability of entry drops to 12.7%.
Conversely, for a party that contests 80% of subnational
races, the probability of entry is 45.3%. Figure 2(b) shows
that there is only a statistically significant relationship for
performance when parties on average earn below about
30% vote share in subnational elections. Thus, as a party's
subnational performance increases to 30%, so does its
probability of running a candidate. Above 30%, the rela-
tionship is no longer statistically significant. Increasing
average vote share to one standard deviation above the
mean ­ 17.7% ­ the likelihood of entry increases to 27.0%.
All probabilities are significant at p = .05. Thus, these
findings show that presence, or the degree to which a
party is nationalized, is a more robust predictor of a par-
ty's probability of running for president across the full
distribution of the variable.
Returning to the example of Ecuador's Living Well
Movement, our results suggest that for the party to contest
the presidency, it must first expand beyond the borders of
Imbabura. In February 2014, the party ran in municipal
elections in only 1 of Ecuador's 24 provinces (4.2%).
Should it choose to continue to contest provincial elections
in the next two years, based on our analysis, it has around a
17% likelihood of fielding a candidate for president if it
focuses only on the single province of Imbabura. Running
in four additional provinces (20.8% of provinces) increases
the likelihood of entering the race to around 20%. Based on
our results, the party will need to contest roughly 75% of
provincial elections (18 provinces) to increase its probabil-
ity of running a presidential candidate to about 40%.
In Hypothesis 3, we argued that a party's subnational
presence and performance are strong predictors of run-
ning for president regardless of election timing or running
in the previous presidential election. The results of Models
2 and 3 support this argument. In Model 2, although the
coefficients for the interaction terms between presence
and performance and concurrent elections are negative,
they are not statistically significant. Similarly, in Model 3,
the coefficients for the interaction terms between presence
and performance and previously running a presidential
candidate are negative, but they are also not statistically
significant. These findings suggest that a party's subna-
tional electoral choices do reflect its decision to enter the
presidential race, and that neither timing of the election
nor previously entering the presidential race appear to
condition this predictive relationship.
Several of our control variables also have a significant
relationship with the likelihood of running a presidential
candidate. First, contesting the election in the most popu-
lous subnational district has a positive and significant rela-
tionship with presidential entry. Given the media attention
and notoriety that both parties and candidates gain by con-
testing subnational races in a country's most populous dis-
trict, this finding may be attributed to the fact that
subnational elections help parties build significant resources
that can be readily transferred to the presidential campaign.
Second, running for executive office at the subnational
level also positively relates to presidential entry. Competing

for governorships may give parties the experience, credibil-
ity, and notoriety necessary for constructing a bid for the
higher-level executive office of the presidency. Third, con-
sistent with West and Spoon (2013) Now added to the bib-
liography, we find that electing the president through a
plurality system increases a party's likelihood of running.
Finally, as expected, running a presidential candidate in the
previous election also strongly predicts entry.
Conclusions
Do the `races at the bottom' predict parties' presidential
entry strategies? Through our analysis of the relationship
between subnational and presidential elections, we find that
a party's decision of whether to run a candidate in the presi-
dential election is predicted by its behavior at the subna-
tional level. Specifically, we find that a party's subnational
electoral presence across districts strongly predicts its
probability of entering the presidential race. Performance
across subnational units also predicts the party's likelihood
of presidential entry, but its predictive power is limited to
smaller parties. Importantly, neither the timing of the elec-
tion nor contesting the previous presidential election condi-
tion how a party's subnational presence or electoral success
predicts its decision to run a presidential candidate. Thus,
our findings lend support to our argument that it is the
degree of a party's nationalization that predicts whether it
will enter the presidential race.
We do, however, acknowledge that through our analy-
sis, we are only able to determine that party nationaliza-
tion predicts presidential entry. We suspect that the
features of subnational electoral participation that we
highlight above ­ e.g. national organizational presence
and the entrance of influential new party members ­ may
cause parties like Ecuador's Living Well, which originate
at the subnational level, to enter the presidential race.
However, because entry in the presidential race is not
randomly assigned and we are unable to control for all
confounding causal factors (such as party ideology, lead-
ership appeal, etc.), we cannot clearly establish a causal
relationship between subnational presence and perfor-
mance and presidential strategy. Future research should
seek to establish the causal relationship between subna-
tional electoral behavior and running presidential candi-
dates by using an approach similar to that of Dinas and
Foos (2013), who use the discontinuities generated by the
5% electoral threshold rule in Germany to determine how
subnational elections affect performance in national
elections.
Unpacking how parties incorporate subnational politics
into their national electoral strategies has several implica-
tions for understanding representative democracy in presi-
dential systems. First, our project is a first step toward
demonstrating the national political consequences of par-
ties'subnational decisions and performance. Though extant
research has shown that subnational elections influence
national legislative party systems (Moreno, 2003; Samuels,
2003), we demonstrate that subnational elections also help
shape presidential elections by predicting when subnation-
ally-competitive and successful parties enter the presiden-
tial race. Using an original cross-national dataset, we show
that when parties gain experience at the subnational level,
they are also more likely to participate in the presidential
race, which also corresponds with an increased size of the
national party system. Second, our project shows how
regionally focused parties may influence national politics.
By predicting when small parties, like Ecuador's Living
Well, enter the presidential race, we find that contesting
subnational elections may provide marginalized popula-
tions and minority groups with greater opportunity in
national politics, in addition to enhancing their chances to
influence regional politics.

Notes
1. Importantly, our argument is that presence and performance
are always strong predictors of presidential entry, regardless
of the causal mechanism at work (whether parties enter sub-
national elections first and then decide to run for president,
or simply supplement their presidential campaign with sub-
national candidates).
2. The countries included in the analysis are Argentina, Austria,
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Ecuador, Finland,
France, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Slovakia,
Uruguay, and Venezuela.
3. We recognize that many parties will coordinate with other
parties and run a joint candidate in the presidential elec-
tions (see Spoon and West, 2015); however, due to space
constraints, we have chosen to focus in this article only on
whether a party runs on its own in the presidential elections.
4. It is important to note that this variable measures the aver-
age vote share of the party across all subnational districts.
This means that if a party did very well in a few districts,
but only ran in a few districts, then the party's average vote
share could be quite low. Therefore, this variable does not
indicate the extent to which a party is nationalized by con-
ventional definitions of nationalization (Morgenstern et al.,
2009). We thus control for the percentage of subnational
elections won by a party to account for the influence of
regional success.
5. We also considered examining whether a party ran in the
subnational unit that contains the capital city or the separate
capital district; however, where there were executive elec-
tions, not all of these entities elected a governor.
6. We also recognize that the relationship between federalism,
subnational elections, and the presidency is complex (see
West and Spoon, 2013). We examine this further in a subse-
quent project.
