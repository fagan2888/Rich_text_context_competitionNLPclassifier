Abstract. Visual illusions constitute an interesting perceptual phenomenon, but they also have an
aesthetic and affective dimension. We hypothesized that the illusive nature itself causes the increased
aesthetic and affective valence of illusions compared with their non-illusory counterparts. We created
pairs of stimuli. One qualified as a standard visual illusion whereas the other one did not, although
they were matched in as many perceptual dimensions as possible. The phenomenal quality of being
an illusion had significant effects on "Aesthetic Experience" (fascinating, irresistible, exceptional,
etc), "Evaluation" (pleasant, cheerful, clear, bright, etc), "Arousal" (interesting, imaginative, complex,
diverse, etc), and "Regularity" (balanced, coherent, clear, realistic, etc). A subsequent multiple
regression analysis suggested that Arousal was a better predictor of Aesthetic Experience than
Evaluation. The findings of this study demonstrate that illusion is a phenomenal quality of the percept
which has measurable aesthetic and affective valence.
Keywords: visual illusions, collative aspects of illusion, aesthetic experience, subjective judgment of a form, a-ha
experience.
1 Introduction
The intriguing properties of visual illusions have attracted attention from ancient thinkers, philosophers,
art impressionists, op artists, and contemporary artistic illusionists (Wade 2005). Psychologists
have been searching for cognitive principles or rules of illusory effects because illusions have been
considered relevant for testing perceptual theories. Furthermore, people often become fascinated or
moved by various visual illusory effects, and it seems that such a visual experience is both perceptually
and emotionally rewarding. This observation might be supported by the popularity of trompe l'oeil or
illusion art.
For centuries the study of visual or aesthetic preference has focused on stimulus properties such as
symmetry, proportion, or complexity, which were regarded as determinants of preference that tended
to yield agreement across individuals. However, recent approaches to visual aesthetics have argued
against those classic ideas and have suggested a "knowledge-based" view of aesthetic preference,
stressing the importance of subjective evaluative processes and semantic associations with visual
stimuli. Furthermore, these studies have argued that cognitive and evaluative processes are intertwined
in Aesthetic Experience (Martindale and Moore 1988; Nadal et al 2008; Silvia 2005a; Reber et al
2004; Vessel and Rubin 2010; see also Wagemans [2011] for further discussion).
In recent studies cognitive factors, such as meaning, novelty, or semantic interpretability, have
been regarded as more essential than perceptual factors in determining visual preference. This new
approach to aesthetics advocates that proximal determinants of preferences are internal factors that
reflect subjective and therefore inherently individual evaluations (Vessel and Rubin 2010). These
evaluative meanings attributed or projected to the external world are referred to as "subjective,"
"connotative," or "implicit." It is commonly opposed to denotative meaning, referred to as "objective,"
"referential," or "explicit" (objective properties such as angular, light, and wooden) (Jankovi in press).
Given this, we would argue that aesthetic processes do not necessarily involve evaluative processes
113

of artistic works alone, but can also be related to any object in the environment with which we are
interacting. Berlyne (1971, 1974b; also see Moles 1968) defined aesthetic stimuli as those possessing
greater qualitative diversity than everyday stimuli, incorporating syntactic (ie, stylistic) as well as
semantic (ie, subject matter) information. Others (Zeki 2002) argued that ambiguity is a highly prized
characteristic of great art because it offers an observer the option of choosing from many alternatives.
Exactly like artworks, visual illusions can also be discussed in terms of ambiguity and qualitative
diversity. This leads us to propose that visual illusions possess aesthetic attributes common to any
other aesthetic object.
In the 1970s, Berlyne suggested that stimulus attributes such as novelty, complexity, surprisingness,
and incongruity (conflict) play a major role in aesthetic responses (Berlyne 1971; Cupchik and Berlyne
1979). In addition, observers need to understand or resolve ambiguity. Silvia (2005a) claimed that
once observers understand the meaning of an observed object, their emotional interest becomes high,
which elicits a strong Aesthetic Experience. Russell and Milne (1997; Russell 2003) have empirically
proven that people enjoy modern art more if they grasp its meaning. Paintings accompanied by brief
descriptions were judged as easier to understand and also more enjoyable and interesting. In addition,
Biederman and Vessel (2006) argued that the key concept for understanding human preference is the
subject's ability to understand the stimuli. Their findings indicate that repeated exposure to stimuli
leads to increased pleasure (see Carbon 2011 for more discussion). This is related to the "click" of
comprehension (Biederman and Vessel 2006), often accompanied by an "A-ha" experience (see Van
de Cruys and Wagemans 2011 for more discussion). In this study, we first examined the Aesthetic
Experience and evaluative meaning of visual illusions (referred to as "implicit features" of visual
illusions) by using dynamic stimuli that enable observers to discern the included illusions.
1.1
Importance of "surprisingness" and "incongruity" in the aesthetic study of visual
illusions
There was, in fact, a precursor in the area of the experimental aesthetics of visual illusions. Noguchi's
(2003) study addressed aesthetic preference regarding several geometrical illusions, including the
Oppel­Kundt grid and concentric circles, Helmholtz radials, the Delboeuf illusion, the Morinaga­
Noguchi illusion, the Ehrenstein figure, or the Kanizsa­Noguchi square. His study revealed a strong
correlation between affective and perceptual judgments. Strong affective preference occurred with
strong effects of illusion; thus, Noguchi suggested that aesthetic as well as perceptual processes should
be investigated. Furthermore, most of the stimuli Noguchi and his colleagues used (Noguchi 2003;
Yoshino et al 2009) were so simple that they were unlikely to be affected by additional meanings or
learned contexts.
In contrast, in the present study, we first selected much richer types of geometrical illusions as
well as other related illusory phenomena, such as ambiguous figures (eg, Rubin's vase profile or
duck-rabbit) and impossible figures (eg, Penrose's triangle or M C Escher's drawings of impossible
buildings), as we assumed that certain properties of miscellaneous illusory effects could be closely
related to Berlyne's (1965) concept of surprisingness and incongruity (conflict). As mentioned before,
these stimulus attributes considered by Berlyne are important aesthetic properties of objects that play
a major role in aesthetic responses. He defined surprisingness as a certain degree of uncertainty that
exists when any number of alternative events occurs. Informational theory expresses uncertainty
as a sum across alternatives, and its maximum is reached when a large number of alternatives are
equally likely. For example, in understanding ambiguous figures, creative processes of a lower order
are initiated. Observers need to consider only a limited number of alternative meanings that could
be attributed. Most observers primarily see only one, although additional explanation and guidance
would reveal other possible meanings. Other good examples would be the tasks of discovering a
hidden meaning or a hidden figure within complex surroundings, eg, Dalmatians among rocks and
similar ambiguous images.
The second aesthetic property suggested by Berlyne (1965) is "incongruity (conflict)," which
refers to received information differing from existing information, such as expectancy violation, or
perceiving incongruent parts within a complete object (see Silvia 2006 for more discussion). For
example, impossible figures are paradoxical, and the paradox is between what we see and what we
know to be possible (Kanizsa 1979). It is also about the contradiction created between different parts of
the same image, which creates a perceptual paradox resulting in a psychological sense of astonishment
(Pinna 2007) and fascination. The perceptual paradox arises from the conflict between the local and
Aesthetic valence of visual illusions 114
global distribution of elements, for example, where parts of a figure or scene are possible but their
combination is impossible.
In other examples of illusions, such as the Optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion or the Rotating Snakes
illusion (Kitaoka 2005; Kitaoka and Ashida 2003), we experience a conflict between what we see and
what is objectively there, described as an expectancy violation. For example, although the Rotating
Snakes illusion is a static image, most observers perceive illusory movement. When viewing illusion
printed on paper, one remarks the conflict is even higher than on a PC display. That is, on first seeing an
illusory figure, most novice viewers do not expect to watch a scene that is not veridical, ie, which does
not correspond to what is objectively there. Certain illusory figures are perceived as illusory only when
their actual physical properties are revealed. In a striking variant of the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet
effect (Cornsweet 1970; Purves et al 1999), most observers perceive and believe that the upper gray
surface is darker than the lower one, although the brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. This
impression is created by the gradient region around the border between the two gray surfaces. If we
can cover this region, it would be easy to see that actually both surfaces are the same in luminance.
A surprising moment of the discovery of what is illusory in an observed scene (ie, when the "A-ha"
experience is derived) sparks fascination, and thus the excitement of the moment of discovery may be
followed by an Aesthetic Experience. This reasoning is highly compatible with a view on the pleasure
of art as derived from a predictive coding account (see Van de Cruys and Wagemans 2011). Thus, we
hypothesized that our stimuli that showed how the illusion can be disambiguated or those showing
gradual transformation starting from weak-or-no illusory figures to fully illusory figures should be
regarded as more interesting and more fascinating than the visual patterns with no illusory effect or
with "unnoticed" illusion.
1.2
Study of subjective judgment of a form (SJF12) and Aesthetic Experience (AE3)
In the early 1970s, Daniel Berlyne initiated numerous studies in which semantic differential scales
were used to investigate the judgments of paintings (Berlyne 1971; Berlyne and Ogilvie 1974; Cupchik
1974), photographs (Libby et al 1973), and miscellaneous visual patterns (Berlyne 1974c; Berlyne et
al 1974; Ertel 1973; Evans and Day 1971). Factor analyses of elementary judgments in these studies
showed great similarity among the extracted factors. The most commonly extracted factors can be
classified in three groups: (1) Evaluation or Hedonic tone (good­bad, pleasant­unpleasant, etc), (2)
Potency or Arousal (strong­weak, interesting­uninteresting, etc), and (3) Activity or Uncertainty
(active­passive, complex­simple, etc). Similar factors extracted from studies by Tucker (1955) and
Osgood et al (1957, 1975) suggest that the elementary implicit features converge into three more
general categories, irrespective of the object of judgment (paintings or non-artistic visual patterns).
Markovi and Jankovi (2001) focused on the latent structure of the subjective or evaluative
meaning. They analyzed whether the numerous evaluative attributes that we find in natural language
could converge to a smaller number of latent dimensions that might indicate the underlying mental
structures responsible for a great variety of the evaluative attributes by which we assess our
surroundings (see also Augustin et al 2011, for a similar approach). This approach was based on the
lexical hypothesis that relative frequency of the attributes in the language corpus indicates their relative
importance in the relevance of their usage for evaluating objects around us. In a similar manner,
subsequent studies analyzed the latent structure of visual stimuli's subjective, evaluative meaning--ie,
the subjective judgments of artistic and non-artistic pictorial content. Through the use of a production
task, a set of descriptors of the subjective experience of visual patterns was obtained. Participants were
asked to list the attributes that expressed their impression of (imagined) visual patterns. In summary, a
set of 65 descriptors was selected. All were given in the form of adjectives, and this form was used to
construct a set of bipolar 7-point scales. In the main experiment, participants rated 16 abstract visual
stimuli on the 65 descriptors. The stimuli were constructed and selected to cover a wide spectrum of
visual Gestalten (from simple geometric figures to abstract artistic drawings). In the factor analysis
(the principal component method plus Promax rotation), the following three factors were obtained:
Evaluation (pleasant, cheerful, serene, clear, etc), Arousal (interesting, imaginative, diverse, complex,
etc), and Regularity (harmonious, coherent, definite, realistic, etc; see Table 1). These factors formed
the instrument that measured subjective judgment of a form on 12 scales, hereinafter referred to as
SJF12.

A similar procedure was used to specify the structure of the aesthetic and emotional domains of
viewers' experience of paintings. Twenty-four paintings used in Markovi and Radonji (2008) were
selected as stimuli for their study. First, 100 paintings were randomly selected from a larger set of 200
figural and 200 semi-figural paintings (50 from each category). Next, participants in a preliminary
study were asked to select 24 paintings to cover the widest possible spectrum of different styles
and motifs (themes). In the main experiment, participants rated the 24 paintings on 31 descriptors
(7-point bipolar scales). The factor analysis revealed two general factors: the bipolar factor, Affective
Tone (descriptors on the positive pole: lovely, charming, cheerful, etc; descriptors on the negative
pole: scary, disgusting, hateful, etc), and Aesthetic Experience (descriptors: exceptional, fascinating,
irresistible, etc). The three most loaded scales with the obtained factor constituted the instrument for
measuring Aesthetic Experience, hereinafter referred to as AE3. The scales ranged from 1 to 7, where
number 1 was equivalent to the assessment of a stimulus as "slightly fascinating" and 7 was equivalent
to the assessment of the stimulus as "extremely fascinating."
In our study, we chose to test illusion patterns using both instruments SJF12 and AE3 assuming
that Aesthetic Experience and implicit features of illusions are conceptually different aspects that
may govern visual preference of illusory patterns. Given the results of the study of the implicit and
explicit features of paintings (Markovi and Radonji 2008), we expected the Aesthetic Experience
of visual illusions to correlate positively with Arousal and Evaluation. Observation time was also
measured. Previous studies demonstrated significant correlation between the observation time and
collative variables (complexity, novelty, etc; Berlyne and Lewis 1963; Berlyne and Lawrence 1964;
Berlyne 1971, 1974b, 1958), as with Silvia's construct of coping potential check (ability to understand
the object or a scene; Silvia 2005b). If our hypothesis is correct, significant correlations between
observation time and Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience should be obtained,
in addition to longer observation times for illusory stimuli compared with stimuli with reduced-or-no
illusory effect.

2.1
Methods
2.1.1 Participants
Thirty-one high school students (18 female and 13 male; mean age 17.0 years old), who visited
the Petnica Science Center, participated in this experiment. We avoided university students from
the psychology department because they might have substantial knowledge about the visual illusions
used in this study.
2.1.2
Stimuli
We produced dynamic stimuli, which showed gradual transformation starting from weak-or-no
illusory figures to fully illusory figures. Our general idea was to show the process of how the illusion
emerges or how the illusion can be revealed. Figures with reduced-or-no illusory effect looked much
similar to illusory figures in the number of elements and visual appearance; however, those patterns
either generated weak illusory effect or could give an illusion once observers became aware of it.
There were 15 pairs of images. For each pair, one was an illusory image and the other was an image

with reduced-or-no illusory effect. The illusory images included the Anderson illusion (Anderson
2005; Figure 1a), the Angel columns figure­ground reversible figure (see http://www.psy.ritsumei.
ac.jp/~akitaoka/illnews14e.html; Figure 1b), the enhanced Cornsweet effect (Cornsweet 1970; Purves
et al 1999; Figure 1c), the frog­horse figure (19th-century art work, USA; Figure 1d), the Necker cube
(Necker 1832; Figure 1e), the shadow ball illusion (Kersten et al 1991; Figure 1f), the modification of
the Münsterberg checkerboard figure, the Café Wall illusion (Fraser 1908; Gregory and Heard 1979;
Figure 2a), the Penrose triangle (Penrose and Penrose 1958; Figure 2b), the Pinna illusion (Pinna and
Brelstaff 2000; Figure 2c), the Rotating Snakes illusion (Kitaoka 2005; Figure 2d), the Breathing
Square illusion (Shiffrar and Pavel 1991; Figure 3a), the Kanizsa Square illusion (Kanizsa 1955,
1976; Figure 3b), the Luckiesh pattern (Luckiesh 1922; Figure 3c), the Marilyn­Einstein hybrid image
(Oliva 2007; Oliva et al 2006; Figure 3d), and the Sound Wave illusion (Kitaoka 1996; Figure 3e).
First, we describe the stimuli that were perceived as illusory once their actual physical properties
were revealed to observers and how original illusory patterns were modified for that purpose. This
group includes the six stimuli and the actual animations as shown in Figure 1.
1. For example, when seeing the Anderson illusion for the first time (Figure 1a), most
novice viewers would not perceive it as an illusory figure, as they would not believe that
the chess pieces of the two images are of the same luminance. The upper chess figures
are usually seen as dark objects behind a light cloud, and the lower chess figures as light
objects behind a dark cloud. This image could be noticed or perceived as illusory once
observers saw both chess sets being physically identical in luminance. For that reason,
the black background in the lower image was slowly unveiled, revealing the bright
background of the upper image, and then turned back to the original black background
(click on figure to view animation). In this way, observers were supposed to become
aware that the chess figures in the upper image were of the same luminance as those in
the lower image. One movie sequence was 8 s long and was played in a loop until the
observers pressed the button to move to the next trial.
2. The Angel columns image (Figure 1b) shows silhouettes of persons standing between
columns, but it is primarily seen as columns in front of the light background because
the columns appear to be realistic objects. In order to demonstrate how the figure and
the background can reverse, black masks emerged from the right and left borders of the
image until the image was covered such that only two white background tiles remained.
We assumed that by blacking out the columns in this manner, the observers would
experience a perceptual flip from the foreground figure to that of the background region,
thereby redirecting their focus from the columns to the human figures. One movie
sequence was 6 s long and was played in a loop until the participants pressed the button
to move to the next trial.
3. When seeing the enhanced Cornsweet effect (Figure 1c), most novice viewers believe
that the upper surface is darker than the lower one, although the brightness of both
surfaces is exactly the same. However, if the region containing the sharp border between
the two gray surfaces and the gradient around the border is hidden under the black mask,
it becomes evident that the brightness of both surfaces is the same. At first, we showed a
dark rectangle passing behind the gray surfaces, in which case the rectangle did not cover
the key region and hence observers should perceive the brightness of the surfaces as
being different. In the next scene, the dark rectangle passed in front of the gray surfaces
blacking out the key region when the observers were supposed to see that the brightness
of both surfaces was the same. In both stimuli, one cycle was 6 s long and played in a
loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
4. The frog­horse figure (Figure 1d) is an example of an ambiguous figure in which
observers tend to see a frog in the left of the image and a horse on the right. In order to
make observers discern this ambiguity, we made a dynamic stimulus in which the left
"frog" was continuously rotated counterclockwise through 90° to make it identical to the
right "horse". In this way, observes could experience a flip between two very different
alternative percepts. Each rotation sequence was 7 s long and was repeated until the
participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
5. The Necker cube (Figure 1e) is an ambiguous line drawing showing a cube in which
observers perceive a cube flipping between two perspectives. In the first scene (Figure 1e),
119
119 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A
a rod passed in front of the cuboid in oblique perspective. We expected that observers
would not see reversals in perspective because their attention should be focused on the
fast-moving rod. In the next scene, one rod moved rightward along the cuboid of one
perspective while the other rod moved downward along the cuboid of the alternative
perspective. This movie was expected to make participants understand how the cube
could change its perspective by changing the sides of the cube appearing behind the rod.
The movie was looped in 4 s cycles.
6. The Shadow Ball illusion (Figure 1f) demonstrates how the motion of the "shadowless"
ball is perceived ambiguously: It can be perceived as either rolling diagonally across the

patterns are shown in the second column, and they were presented subsequently: (a) Modification of

floor or as rising diagonally along the same depth plane. It is believed that our visual
system cannot decide between the two simplest possibilities for the movement of the
ball. The trajectory of the ball without a shadow is consistent with a ball rising on the
same depth plane as well as a ball receding into the distance against a level surface. A
shadow is a strong cue for both the ball's trajectory and its depth. Thus, in the first scene
presented to participants a gray ball without a shadow moved along a diagonal trajectory.
The participants were supposed to perceive it as either rolling diagonally across the floor
or as rising diagonally along the same depth plane. The movie sequence was 10 s long
and was played in a loop. In the following scene, we added the diagonal and "zig-zag"
moving shadow, which should have made the ball appear to roll diagonally across the
floor in the first case or to bounce along the floor in the second case. Participants who
saw this series of stimuli were supposed to understand that the ball's perceived motion
depends on the shadow's motion. One movie sequence was 10 s long and was played in
a loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
In the second group of stimuli, each pair contained one figure with reduced illusory effect and one
figure with the highest possible intensity of illusory effect. This group includes the four stimuli shown
in Figure 2.
1. A modification of the Münsterberg checkerboard figure (Figure 2a) has the checkerboard
pattern with horizontal borders isoluminant with the light regions. When the position of
the dark and light tiles deviates from the standard checkerboard pattern, the alternate
horizontal lines appear to be slightly tilted in opposite directions. The strongest effect
(c)
(d)

121
121 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A
occurs when the rows of the tiles are separated by a thin line of mortar and its luminance
is between the luminance of the dark and light tiles. This was demonstrated by Gregory
and Heard (1979) as the Café Wall illusion. In the first scene presented to our participants,
mortar lines between rows were of the same luminance as the light tiles. Alternate
rows were moving horizontally in the same direction at a constant speed. Observers
were supposed to perceive the mortar lines being slightly tilted when the position of
the dark and light tiles deviated from the usual checkerboard pattern. However, in the
following scene, we changed the mortar lines' luminance to gray. Participants should
have experienced a strong tilt illusion. One cycle was 5 s long and was played in a loop
until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
2. The Penrose triangle (Figure 2b) is a tribar that appears to be a solid object made of three
straight beams of a square cross section that meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices
of the triangle they form. Parts of the triangle are not ambiguous, but they are drawn
in incompatible perspectives and thus cannot be realized by any three-dimensional
object in ordinary Euclidean space. In such ambiguous figures, there is a perceptual
conflict between the local and global distribution of the elements. In order to create
"disambiguous" figures, we needed to resolve the local­global perceptual conflict. The
first scene presented to the participants had a triangle split into three pieces shaped like
the letter V, and we called it a "disambiguous" figure because the two tiles of each letter
V are drawn in a possible perspective. In the following scene the three V-shaped pieces
were joined at the ends to form a triangle, but in this case, the triangle they formed had
sides drawn in incompatible perspectives. We used dynamic demonstration to show how
the illusion can emerge and to allow time for participants to discern how the ambiguity
arose. One cycle was 6 s long and was played in a loop until the participants pressed the
button to move to the next trial.
3. The Pinna illusion (Figure 2c) has the parallelograms delineated by two white and two
black edges, each of which are grouped by proximity in three concentric rings. All the
parallelograms have the same width, length, and orientation in relation to the center of
their circular arrangements. When the observers' heads are slowly moved toward the
figure with the gaze fixed at the center, the inner ring of the parallelograms appears
to rotate counterclockwise while the outer ring clockwise. The direction of rotation is
reversed when the observers move away from the figure. In the first scene presented to
the participants, the rings of the parallelograms expanded and contracted physically as if
the observers were moving their heads toward and away, respectively, from the figure. We
added shorter parallelogram diagonal lines, which were supposed to even out the local
distribution of elements in all rings, and therefore, participants should have perceived a
weak illusory effect (Fermüller and Malm 2004). While expanding, the inner ring of the
parallelograms should have appeared to rotate slightly in the counterclockwise direction
and the outer ring slightly in the clockwise direction. The perceived direction of rotation
should have been reversed when the image contracted. In the following scene, instead of
the short lines, we added longer diagonal lines to the middle ring squares, which were
supposed to enhance the illusory effect caused by the uneven distribution of elements
(Fermüller and Malm 2004). In both stimuli, one cycle was 5 s long and was played in a
loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
4. The Rotating Snakes illusion (Figure 2d) is a static image that appears to move slowly
and "spontaneously." The strongest illusory effect is seen in the radial circular pattern.
To reduce the strength of the Rotating Snakes illusion, we rearranged its constituent
elements into a columnar pattern, as it gives weak or no illusory motion. Participants
were presented first with a columnar pattern and then with a circular radial pattern.
In the third group of stimuli, each pair contained one non-illusory figure and one illusory figure. This
group includes the five stimuli shown in Figure 3.
1. The Breathing square illusion (Figure 3a) has a red square rotating at a constant speed
around an imaginary y-axis. The rotating red square is partially hidden by four blue
squares (occluders). What is commonly perceived is that the red square appears to grow
and shrink as it turns, but in fact its size does not change. This illusion depends on the
size of the occluders, and thus in the first scene presented to the participants, the width of
Aesthetic valence of visual illusions 122
the cross arms formed by the blue occluders was 50% to 60% of the length of the side of
the rotating square. What most observers were supposed to see was the square rotating
but not changing in size. In the next scene we changed the size of the occluders, forming
a cross of small arm width. When the red square rotated, most observers were supposed
to perceive the square changing in size so that it appeared to "breathe"--contract and
expand. After a few seconds, occluders began to contract, and once the occluders were
small enough (the same size as that in the first scene), the illusion disappeared. In both
stimuli, one cycle was 8 s long and played in a loop until participants pressed the button
to move to the next trial.
2. The Kanizsa square (Figure 3b) image has four black Pac-Men facing inward that create
an impression of the white illusory square superimposed on the four black circles. If four
Pac-Men are randomly placed on a white canvas, most observers should not perceive
anything else besides those four Pac-Men. Thus, to show how the illusion arises, the
four randomly placed Pac-Men were put in rotation until they were facing inward to
form the illusory square, although none was drawn. The illusory square was supposed to
disappear once the Pac-Men began rotating backward to return to their initial position.
One cycle was 6 s long and played in a loop until participants pressed the button to move
to the next trial.
3. The Luckiesh pattern (Figure 3c) is an optical illusion that demonstrates how bounding
objects such as circles can appear distorted in the presence of radiating lines. The first
dynamic stimulus presented to the participants showed a circle passing through the
vertical parallel lines in which case the circle should not appear distorted. In the next
scene the circle passed through the set of radiating lines that made the circle appear
distorted. Observers who saw these dynamic stimuli series were supposed to understand
that the circle would appear distorted only in the presence of the radiating lines but not
in the presence of the vertical parallel lines. In both stimuli, one movie sequence was
17 s long and played in a loop until the participants pressed the button to move to the
next trial.
4. Combining a low-spatial-frequency and a high-spatial-frequency image yields a hybrid
image that can be interpreted differently depending on the viewing distance. We used the
Marilyn­Einstein hybrid image (Figure 3d), which is a combination of the low-spatial-
frequency Marilyn Monroe image and the high-spatial-frequency Albert Einstein image.
When seeing it close up, most observers can recognize the face of Albert Einstein, but
if they step back, the image of Marilyn Monroe becomes clear. In the scene presented
first to the participants, we used high spatial frequency images of Marilyn and Albert
whose interpretation does not depend on the viewing distance (size of the image on the
screen--large vs thumbnail size is irrelevant). In the following scene we presented a
large size hybrid image of Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe, and most observers were
supposed to see only the image of Albert Einstein. To reveal the presence of the low-
spatial-frequency image of Marilyn Monroe, after a few seconds, the hybrid image
shrank to thumbnail size when the thumbnail image of Marilyn Monroe appeared
below and most observers were supposed to see notable resemblance in these pictures.
In both stimuli, one "zoom in zoom out" sequence was 5 s long and played in a loop until
the participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.
5. The Sound Wave illusion (Figure 3e) has the checkerboard pattern as the basic image.
The rows of dark and light tiles are separated by a thin line of mortar. The mortar lines
do not appear to be distorted or tilted in a typical checkerboard pattern; however, if
small white squares are added in the corners of the larger black squares, the vertical or
horizontal mortar lines appear distorted. Using animation, we gradually added the small
white squares to the larger black squares of the checkerboard pattern and then in the same
fashion gradually removed them. In this way, observers were supposed to understand
that the mortar lines appear distorted only when small white squares are present in the
corners of the larger black squares. One cycle was 8 s long and played in a loop until
participants pressed the button to move to the next trial.

Procedure
Subjects were individually tested. Participants sat approximately 50 cm away from the computer
screen. Each participant was presented with all experimental trials. Thirty stimuli were presented
one at a time in 15 pairs of trials. For each pair, one was an illusory image while the other was an
image with reduced-or-no illusory effect. The presentation of the no-or-weak illusory stimulus always
preceded that of the illusory stimulus (Figure 3). Subjects were given the task to look at the object or
the scene as long as they wanted or needed to until the image became boring. Their observation time
was measured. They were instructed to observe each scene carefully, paying attention to changes.
In each trial, participants indicated their judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience
(choosing the value on the SJF12 and AE3 scales) for the image shown in that particular trial. The
presentation time was individual because subjects decided how long they wanted or needed to see each
scene. When they were ready, they pushed the forward button, and the next trial began. There was no
interstimulus interval. Pairs of stimuli were randomized in order to neutralize the possible effect of

sequence and practice. In addition, the order of the scales was randomized for each participant and
each stimulus.
3 Results and discussion
For Evaluation scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.67, SD 1.18) was
higher than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 4.29, SD 1.04)(F(1,30) =
23.41, p < 0.01). For Arousal scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 5.20,
SD 1.29) was higher than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 3.95, SD 1.39)
(F(1,30) = 151.06, p < 0.01). For Regularity scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli
(Mean 4.61, SD 1.14) was lower than that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 4.73,
SD 1.09), but this difference was not statistically significant (F(1,30) = 2.45, ns). Finally, the pooled
average of Aesthetic Experience scores for the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.08, SD 1.61) was higher than
that of the stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 2.92, SD 1.42) (F(1,30) = 96.79, p < 0.01).
These results revealed that illusory stimuli were judged significantly higher than stimuli with reduced-
or-no illusory effects for Arousal, Evaluation, and Aesthetic Experience, but not for Regularity.
In addition, the results revealed a significant effect of "stimuli" on judgments of Evaluation
(F(14,30) = 6.46, p < 0.01), Arousal (F(14,30) = 13.03, p < 0.01), Regularity (F(14,30) = 8.83,
p < 0.01), and Aesthetic Experience (F(14,30) = 9.85, p < 0.01). There was also a significant
interaction between "illusion" and "stimuli" for judgments of Evaluation (F(14,420) = 2.41, p < 0.01),
Arousal (F(14,420) = 12.78, p < 0.01), Regularity (F(14,420) = 5.18, p < 0.01), and Aesthetic
Experience (F(14,420) = 6.89, p < 0.01).
Figure 4. The lower sequence of images shows the stimulus presented first, and the upper sequence of
images shows the subsequent stimulus. The lower sequence of images shows the enhanced Cornsweet
effect, in which the upper gray surface is commonly perceived as darker than the lower one, although
the brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. Novice viewers do not see this illusion until it is
demonstrated that the brightness of both surfaces is exactly the same. Thus, by covering the gradient
region containing the border between the two gray surfaces (upper sequence of images), observers are
supposed to see that the brightness of both surfaces was the same.
Aesthetic valence of visual illusions 126
For Evaluation scores (Figure 5), certain stimuli got relatively high average ratings; for example,
the Penrose triangle, Rotating Snakes figures, Necker cube, Kanizsa square, and the Sound Wave
illusion. The Cornsweet effect figure was rated significantly lower than all other illusions used in
this study. Furthermore, for Arousal scores (Figure 6), the Cornsweet effect figure, together with the
Kanizsa square and the Luckiesh pattern, received statistically lower average ratings than the Rotating
Snakes figure, Penrose triangle, frog­horse figure, Café Wall, Anderson, and Sound Wave illusions.
Similarly, for Regularity scores (Figure 7), the Luckiesh pattern, Cornsweet effect figure, and Necker
cube figure received lower ratings than theAngel columns,Anderson illusion, frog­horse, and Kanizsa
square figures. Finally, the Penrose triangle, Rotating snakes pattern, frog­horse figure, Café Wall, and
Sound Wave illusion received statistically higher aesthetic scores compared to the Luckiesh pattern,
Cornsweet effect figure, and Kanizsa square (Figure 8). The Necker cube was rated significantly lower
than the Penrose triangle, Rotating snakes pattern, and frog­horse figure.
Interestingly enough, the largest differences between illusory and reduced-or-no illusory patterns
were obtained forArousal andAesthetic Experience scores of the Necker cube and Sound Wave stimuli.
Relatively large differences between illusory and reduced-or-no illusory patterns were also obtained for
the Marilyn­Einstein hybrid image, Shadow ball illusion, Breathing square, Kanizsa square, Luckiesh
pattern, and Café Wall stimulus pairs. However, certain partial differences for Arousal and Aesthetic
Experience scores were not significant; for example, the frog­horse stimulus pair, Penrose triangle
stimulus pair, Pinna illusion stimulus pair, and Rotating Snakes stimulus pair. Partial differences
between aesthetic scores of illusory patterns and patterns with reduced-or-no illusory effects were
significant except for the Rotating Snakes stimulus pair (Figure 8).

Correlation and regression analysis between SJF12 and AE3
Previous studies of Aesthetic Experience and implicit features of paintings (Markovi and Radonji
2008; Markovi 2010) demonstrated significant correlation betweenAesthetic Experience and judgments
of implicit features of paintings. Our results agreed with these studies because significant Pearson's
correlation coefficients between Evaluation and Aesthetic Experience (r(28) = 0.70, p < 0.01) and
between Arousal and Aesthetic Experience (r(28) = 0.97, p < 0.01) were obtained. For the correlation
and regression analysis, we calculated the mean rating score for each stimulus (15 illusory and 15 with
reduced-or-no illusory effect) on Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience. Multiple
regression analysis of the data matrix consisting of SJF12 and AE3 dimensions in columns and stimuli
in rows (4 x 30) showed that the SJF12 factors were good predictors of AE3: r2 = 0.96, F(3,26) =
224.92, p < 0.001. Arousal (b = 0.88, t(26) = 17.69, p < 0.001) and Evaluation (b = 0.12, t(26) = 2.57,
p < 0.05) significantly predicted Aesthetic Experience scores (Figure 9), whereas Regularity was not
found to be a significant predictor of Aesthetic Experience (t(26) = 0.74, p > 0.05). Beta coefficients
implied that Arousal might be a better predictor than Evaluation, but in order to determine whether
Arousal was a significantly better predictor than Evaluation, we used an additional test. First, we
examined multicolinearity between Arousal and Evaluation because the correlation between them was
0.61. If there was multicolinearity, we could not argue their independent contributions to the regression
model. Colinearity statistics indicated that the tolerance for Evaluation was 0.567 and for Arousal was
0.571, which was much higher than 0.02 (a lower boundary that would suggest multicolinearity).
Furthermore, the average VIF value was 1.53, which was lower than 10 (an upper boundary). Thus,
we found no problem of multicolinearity and could proceed with testing which of the two independent
variables would better predict aesthetic responses. We used a test proposed by Meng et al (1992), a
simple extension of Dunn and Clark's (1969) work, which uses Fisher's Z transformation and includes
the test and confidence interval for comparing two correlated correlations. The Z test value was 5.86
when comparing the correlation between Arousal and Aesthetic Experience (r
1
= 0.976) with the
correlation between Evaluation and Aesthetic Experience (r
2
= 0.712). The 95% confidence interval
was 1.32+/-0.43, (0.89, 1.75), two-tailed p < 0.01. Thus, we may conclude that Arousal predicts
Aesthetic Experience responses significantly better than Evaluation.

3.1.1
Observation time for the illusory and non-illusory stimuli; Correlation with
SJF12 and AE3
Previous studies demonstrated significant correlation between observation time and
collative variables: complexity and novelty (Berlyne and Lewis 1963; Berlyne and
Lawrence 1964; Berlyne 1958, 1971, 1974c), as with Silvia's construct of coping potential
check (ability to understand an object or a scene) (Silvia 2005b). We expected significant
correlations between observation time and Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic
Experience, in addition to longer observation time for illusory stimuli compared to stimuli
with reduced-or-no illusory effect. Some of these expectations were confirmed by the
results of this study, but others were not. The pooled average of the observation time for
illusory stimuli (Mean 21.69 s, SD 17.58 s) was significantly longer than the observation
time for stimuli with reduced-or-no illusory effect (Mean 12.79 s, SD 11.89 s) (F (1,30) =
57.87, p < 0.001), which suggests that subjects spent more time viewing illusory stimuli.
In addition, there was a significant main effect of "stimuli" (F(14,30) = 9.39, p < 0.001)
and significant interaction between "stimuli" and "illusion" (F(14,30) = 3.78, p < 0.001),
showing no significant differences in observation time between certain illusory patterns
and patterns with reduced-or-no illusory effect for the frog­horse stimulus pair, Café Wall
stimulus pair, Penrose triangle stimulus pair, Rotating Snakes stimulus pair, and Kanizsa
square stimulus pair (Table 2).
We found non-significant positive correlations between observation time and
Arousal (r(28) = 0.36, p > 0.05 ), as well as with Aesthetic Experience (r(28) = 0.32, p
> 0.05). In addition, regression analyses showed that none of the SJF12 factors or AE3
were significant predictors of observation time: r2 = 0.20 F(4,25) = 1.61, p > 0.05 (Table
3). Future studies could test these tendencies on a greater number of illusion examples.
Other physiological measures that may reflect affective changes should also be taken into
account, eg, the psychogalvanic reflex or heart rate.
To summarize, we can say that some of our hypothesis were confirmed: the stimuli that enabled
observers to discern the included illusions (which showed how the illusion can be disambiguated or
showing gradual transformation starting from reduced-or-no illusory figures to fully illusory figures)
were regarded as more interesting and more fascinating than the visual patterns with reduced-or-no
illusory effect. In other words, we would argue that the illusive nature itself, if revealed to observers,
increases the aesthetic and affective valence of visual patterns. This is most evident with the stimuli
which are rather simple in shape or with fewer details like the Necker cube and Kanizsa square.
The large differences in aesthetic scores obtained between illusory and their non-illusory counterparts
speak in favor of this idea. In order to test the generalizability of this finding and to try to establish a
better experimental control, we conducted the second experiment.

Aesthetic Experience was a criterion variable.

4 Experiment 2
In Experiment 1, reduced-or-no illusory stimuli always preceded illusory stimuli, suggesting a
possibility that this fixed order might have affected the results. To examine whether the order of
presentation has an effect on aesthetic and affective scores, Experiment 2 compared the order when
non-illusory stimuli were followed by illusory stimuli with its reversed order when illusory stimuli
were followed by non-illusory stimuli.
Non-illusory and illusory patterns were matched in as many perceptual features as possible: the
number of elements, visual appearance, and the presence or duration of the motion, hence the notable
difference was whether or not illusion was included and discerned. We selected a few pairs of stimuli
that showed remarkable differences in Experiment 1, such as the Necker cube or Kanizsa square, to
obtain better control stimuli and to test generalizability of the findings of Experiment 1. In this respect,
we asked university students to participate in this experiment, rather than to merely replicate the first
experiment.
4.1
Methods
4.1.1 Participants
Students of the Ritsumeikan University from the psychology and history departments (4 females and
17 males; mean age 25.6 years old) participated.
4.1.2
Stimuli
We chose to develop further the four stimulus pairs used in the first experiment, which had yielded the
largest differences between reduced-or-no illusory and illusory figures: The Kanisza square stimulus
pair, the Café Wall stimulus pair, the Necker cube stimulus pair, and the Sound Wave stimulus pair.
131
131 Stevanov  J, Markovi S, Kitaoka A
As the fifth stimulus pair, we added the modification of the optimized Fraser­Wilcox illusion type IIa
(Kitaoka 2008a, 2008b) as a variation of the Rotating Snakes pattern. In the first experiment, only the
Rotating Snakes stimulus pair received no significant differences in Aesthetic Experience scores. The
version we used in the present study is rather novel to participants, which is one of the reasons why
we did not include the Rotating Snakes illusion as many participants may have been familiar with it.
Figures with no illusory effect looked as similar to the illusory figures as possible in the number of
elements and visual appearance but without illusory effect (Figure 10). In the first experiment, we used
several stimulus pairs in which the reduced-or-no illusory figure was stationary and the illusory figure
was dynamic. One may argue that the motion might have increased aesthetic scores; thus, all stimuli
used in the present study were dynamic (ie, no stationary images were used).
1. For example, in the first experiment, the modification of the Kanizsa square was a
stationary image with the four Pac-Men randomly placed on a white canvas, hence
no illusory square could be observed. In the second experiment, we made dynamic
modification of the same image. Those four Pac-Men rotated simultaneously until they
were aligned outward and for the illusory stimulus, the Pac-Men rotated simultaneously
until they were facing inward (Figure 10a). In this way the possible motion effect could
be controlled.
2. The Café Wall illusion (Figure 10b) was a bit modified for the second experiment. For
the non-illusory stimulus instead of using the mortar lines that are isoluminant with
the light tiles, we followed Gregory's definition of the Café Wall illusion (Gregory and
Heard 1979) and used the light and dark gray tiles separated by a thin line of mortar
whose luminance wasn't between the luminance of the dark and light tiles ie they were
black. For the illusory stimulus, the luminance of the mortar lines was exactly between
the luminance of the dark and light tiles. Alternate rows were moving horizontally in the
same direction at a constant speed. The version we created for the second experiment is
not the typical version of the Café Wall illusion, thus participants should not be familiar
with it.
3. For the modification of the Necker cube illusion (Figure 10c) we used a grayscale rod
that moved along the horizontal and vertical trajectories in front of the cuboid in oblique
perspective. In the first experiment, the rod was of a different color in illusory and non-
illusory stimulus; thus we wanted to make them as similar as possible. For the illusory
stimulus, one rod moved rightward along and through the cuboid of one perspective,
and the other rod moved downward along and through the cuboid of the alternative
perspective. This movie was expected to make participants understand how the cube
could change its perspective by changing which cube side appeared behind the rod.
4. The non-illusory modification of the Sound Wave illusion pattern was created by adding
small white squares in the center of the larger black squares. In this way, the horizontal
and vertical mortar lines did not appear to be distorted or tilted but the non-illusory and
illusory stimulus were matched in visual appearance and presence of the motion. In
dynamic version of the Sound Wave illusion small white squares are added in the corners
of the larger black squares, hence the vertical or horizontal mortar lines should appear
distorted (Figure 10d). The area of those small white squares was subtracted from that of
the larger white squares placed in the center of the non-illusory pattern. Observers were
supposed to understand that the mortar lines appear distorted only when the small white
squares are present in the corners of the larger black squares.
5. The optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II pattern has an array of four regions of
different luminance in the systematic order "black," "dark grey (blue)," "white," and
"light grey" (yellow), which evokes the perception of a slow rotational illusory motion.
If the color sequence between adjacent units is reversed, most observers do not perceive
any rotational movement (Kuriki et al 2008). Thus, for the reduced-or-non illusory
stimulus (Figure 10e), we created circular patterns with units of colors in the following
order: blue, black, blue, white, yellow, black, yellow, white or blue, white, blue, black,
yellow, white, yellow, black. Using a video transition that fades out one scene while
fading in the next, after a few seconds, two adjacent blue units switched places with the
two adjacent yellow units. Black and white units kept their positions. For the illusory
stimulus the color sequence reversed between adjacent yellow and blue units to create the

Procedure
The procedure was very similar to Experiment 1. Subjects were individually tested. Participants
sat approximately 70-cm away from the computer screen. Each participant was presented with all
experimental trials. Ten stimuli were presented one at a time in five pairs of trials. For each pair, one
was an illusory image and the other was a non-illusory image. One group of the participants was
presented with the non-illusory stimulus followed by the presentation of the illusory stimulus. Another
group of participants had the illusory followed by non-illusory stimulus. In each trial, participants
indicated their judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience (choosing the value on the SJF
12 and AE3 scales) for the image shown in that particular trial.
5 Results and discussion
The mean rating scores for Evaluation, Arousal, Regularity, and Aesthetic Experience are shown in
Figures 11­14. Results revealed that there was no significant effect of presentation order for each score
(all F < 1). There were also no significant interactions between "illusion" and "stimuli" for each score.
These results exclude the possibility that testing order might have played a part in Experiment 1.
For Evaluation scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.96, SD 1.12) was
higher than that of the non-illusory stimuli (Mean 4.51, SD 1.02) (F(1,19) = 20.78, p < 0.01). For
Arousal scores, the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 5.18, SD 1.23) was higher than
that of the non-illusory ones (Mean 3.92, SD 1.51) (F(1,19) = 60.18, p < 0.01). For Regularity scores,
the pooled average rating of the illusory stimuli (Mean 4.58, SD 1.13) was higher than that of the
stimuli without illusory effect (Mean 4.40, SD 1.02), but this difference was not statistically significant
(F(1,19) < 1). Finally, the pooled average of Aesthetic Experience scores for the illusory stimuli (Mean
4.56, SD 1.54) was higher than that of the non-illusory stimuli (Mean 3.22, SD 1.38) (F(1,19) =
39.35, p < 0.01). These results revealed that illusory stimuli were judged significantly higher than

Figure 10 (continued).
Aesthetic valence of visual illusions 134
non-illusory stimuli for Arousal, Evaluation, and Aesthetic Experience, but not for Regularity. These
results are entirely consistent with those of Experiment 1.
Furthermore, the results revealed a significant effect of "stimuli" on judgments of Arousal
(F(4,19) = 6.67, p < 0.01), Regularity (F(4,19) = 5.35, p < 0.01), and Aesthetic Experience (F(4,19) =
3.4, p < 0.01). There was also a significant interaction between "illusion" and "stimuli" for judgments
of Arousal (F(4,76) = 9.05, p < 0.01), Regularity (F(4,420) = 4.71, p < 0.01), and Aesthetic Experience
(F(4,76) = 6.75, p < 0.01).
Furthermore, partial differences for Arousal scores between illusory and non-illusory patterns
were not significant for the Kanizsa square stimulus pair and optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II
stimulus pair. Interestingly enough, partial differences between aesthetic scores of illusory and non-
illusory patterns were significant except for the optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion type II stimulus,
which confirms the results of Experiment 1.
Similarly, large differences between illusory and non-illusory patterns were obtained for the
Arousal and Aesthetic Experience scores of the Necker cube and Sound wave figures, which is in line
with the results of Experiment 1. Furthermore, the Kanizsa square and the Necker cube received overall
lower ratings on Arousal and Aesthetic Experience than the Café Wall, Sound Wave, or optimized
Fraser Wilcox illusion, although they showed significantly higher scores on Regularity than the Sound
Wave or optimized Fraser Wilcox illusion. These results also agree with those of Experiment 1.
6 General discussion
In this study we obtained judgments of implicit features and Aesthetic Experience for pairs of stimuli,
an illusory pattern and its reduced-or-no illusory counterpart. The results suggest that illusory patterns
(1) are more arousing, ie, they were judged as more interesting, imaginative, complex, diverse, etc;
(2) have higher hedonic tone, ie, they were scored as more pleasant, cheerful, bright, clear, etc; and
(3) possess aesthetic qualities, ie, they were judged as more fascinating, exceptional, irresistible,
etc. However, variations in illusion strength did not affect cognitive clarity (definite, realistic, etc)
or aesthetic balance (harmonious, coherent, etc). The stimuli we examined were designed to enable
observers to discern the included illusions. Two stimuli sets were matched in as many perceptual
features as possible, but the notable difference was whether or not illusion was included and discerned.

Aesthetic valence of visual illusions 136
Once the illusion was revealed to observers, it increased the aesthetic and affective valence of the
visual patterns. This was the most evident with the stimuli which are rather simple in shape or with
fewer details like the Necker cube and Kanizsa square. As visual patterns, they received relatively
low overall ratings on Arousal and Aesthetic Experience as compared with the more complex richly
detailed visual patterns like the Rotating Snakes, Café Wall, frog-horse, or Marilyn­Einstein hybrid
image. It agrees with the notion that the complexity­simplicity dimension of visual patterns affects
aesthetic responses. However, the differences in Arousal and Aesthetic scores between illusory and
their non-illusory counterparts were among the largest. In other words, the presence of illusion created
a robust effect on Arousal and Aesthetic judgments.
One possible explanation of this finding is that stimulus properties are actually less important for
aesthetic assessment of visual illusions than the ease of discerning the included illusion (ie, the ease
of deriving an "A-ha" experience). Furthermore, this strongly agrees with the idea that objects which
possess "high conceptual fluency due to meaningfulness" are processed more efficiently (achieving
awareness of illusory effect) with less cognitive resources and therefore preferred over objects whose
processing requires more of the cognitive resources (see Winkielman et al 2003; Reber et al 2004, for
further discussion). In this respect, the understanding of the meaning of an object is weighted more
heavily than stimulus factors in determining visual preference of the illusory patterns. We suggest that
the Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions might reflect an interaction between assessments of the
illusory effect (how fascinating it might be) and efficiency of cognitive processing in observers (how
easy it was to understand it).
One surprising result of this study is that variations in strength of the motion illusion effect,
such as in Rotating Snakes figures, did not affect judgments of Aesthetic Experience. Both figures
with strong and weak motion illusion obtained overall high aesthetic scores. It might be possible that
certain illusions do not have an effect on Aesthetic Experience judgments, but we also recognize the
possibility that the weak illusory figures possess such abundant colorfulness and richness in details to
equal the aesthetic contribution from the illusion.
Other findings of the present study suggest that Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions is closer
to Curiosity (ie, preferring unusual and interesting contents) than to Hedonic tone (pleasantness), as
results indicated that Arousal is a better predictor of Aesthetic Experience than Evaluation. In defining

what is interesting, the theories generally agree. Most theories proposed Berlyne's family of collative
variables (novelty, complexity, surprisingness, incongruity, etc) or similar concepts like information
conflict (Nuannlly 1981) and information gaps (Loewenstein 1994). Cupchik and Gebotys (1990)
found that the underlying dimension of interest reflected the perception of novelty and meaningfulness,
while that of enjoyment reflected the perception of emotional warmth.As mentioned earlier, we argued
that visual illusions can be related to the concepts of "surprisingness" and "incongruity", which were
expected to play an important role in aesthetic assessment of visual patterns. The results of this study
agree well with our theoretical assumptions (see also Van der Cruys and Wagemans 2011).
Previous studies (Noguchi 2003; Yoshino et al 2009) found that strong affective preference
occurred with strong effect of illusion; however, most of the stimuli Noguchi and his colleagues used
were simple geometrical illusions. In this study we tried to cover a much wider range of illusory
patterns and to offer a better understanding of the implicit features and aesthetic properties of the
illusory figures. Moreover, we tried to isolate and capture the contribution of the illusion in assessment
of the visual patterns as a phenomenal quality that has measurable aesthetic and affective valence.
Having in mind all constraints of the present study, we may say that it provides a useful framework for
studying the Aesthetic Experience of visual illusions. Future studies could, using a variety of visual
stimuli (both artistic and non-artistic, eg, visual illusions), identify those invariants that bind together
diverse types of artistic and non-artistic aesthetic objects, scenes, and events.
