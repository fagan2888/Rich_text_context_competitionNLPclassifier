Objectives. This study examined whether psychological adjustment to widowhood is affected by three aspects of
marital quality--warmth, conflict, and instrumental dependence--assessed prior to the loss.
Methods. The Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) is a prospective study of a two-stage area probability sam-
ple of 1,532 married individuals aged 65 and older. The CLOC includes baseline data on marital quality and mental
health and data on grief, anxiety, and depression collected 6, 18, and 48 months after spousal loss.
Results. Widowhood was associated with elevated anxiety among those who were highly dependent on their spouses
and lower levels of anxiety among those who were not dependent on their spouses. Levels of yearning were lower for
widowed persons whose relationships were conflicted at baseline and higher for those reporting high levels of marital
closeness and dependence on their spouses. Women who relied on their husbands for instrumental support had signifi-
cantly higher levels of yearning than men who depended on their wives.
Discussion. The findings contradict the widespread belief that grief is more severe if the marriage was conflicted and
suggest a more complex relationship between bereavement and characteristics of the marriage.
IDOWHOOD is characterized as one of the most dis-
tressing of all life events (Holmes & Rahe, 1967).
Because the modern nuclear family is expected to be so-
cially and economically autonomous, spouses may have few
alternative sources of social, emotional, or instrumental sup-
port (Lopata, 1973; Volkart & Michael, 1957). Consequently,
when a spouse dies, the survivor must not only adjust to the
loss of a close relationship, but also manage the daily deci-
sions and responsibilities that were once shared by both
spouses (Carey, 1979­80; Wortman, Kessler, & Umberson,
1992). In this study we examined whether psychological ad-
justment to widowhood is affected by three dimensions of the
marital relationship (warmth­closeness, conflict, and instru-
mental dependence, assessed at baseline) in a representative
community sample of widows and matched controls. Using
data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) sur-
vey, we addressed three questions: (a) Does the effect of wid-
owhood on depression and anxiety differ as a function of the
quality of the marriage? (b) How does marital quality before
spousal death influence grief? and (c) Do the effects observed
under (a) and (b) vary by gender?
Theoretical Issues
Despite widespread belief that widowhood is the most
stressful of all life events (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), most
studies concur that only 15­30% experience clinically sig-
nificant depression in the year following their spouse's
death (Jacobs, Hansen, Berkman, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1989;
Lund et al., 1985­86; Stroebe, Stroebe, & Hanson, 1993;
Wortman & Silver, 1989; Zisook & Schucter, 1991). Three
explanations are generally offered for the inconsistent link
between widowhood and adjustment. First, the mental health
effects of widowhood attenuate over time, and studies that
focus on relatively long time horizons may underestimate
the short-term emotional consequences (Bruce, Kim, Leaf,
& Jacobs, 1990; Ferraro, 1984; Futterman, Gallagher, Thomp-
son, Lovett, & Gilewski, 1990; Lund, Caserta, Dimond, &
Shapper, 1989; Mendes de Leon, Kasl, & Jacobs, 1994). Sec-
ond, different aspects of mental health may follow different
trajectories (Jacobs et al., 1987­88, p. 48), and analyses that
focus only on a broad grief scale or a global measure of
mental health, such as depression, may mask patterns among
more specific symptoms such as anxiety (Prigerson et al.,
1996; Zisook, Schucter, & Lyons, 1987) or yearning, a pre-
occupation with and pining for the deceased (Archer, 1999,
p. 24; Bowlby, 1980). To address these concerns, we focused
on three indicators of psychological well being: depression,
anxiety, and yearning, assessed 6 months after the loss.
A third explanation for the relatively weak relationship be-
tween widowhood and psychological adjustment is that emo-
tional responses to loss vary widely on the basis of personal
resources, contextual factors, and personality. Personal re-
sources such as education (Lopata, 1975), income (Arens,
1982), good health (Norris & Murrell, 1987), and social sup-
W

port (Krause, 1986; Lepore, Silver, Wortman, & Wayment,
1996; Norris & Murrell, 1990) may protect against severe de-
pression, anxiety, or grief. Contextual factors, such as the type
or duration of illness experienced by spouse prior to death,
may also account for variation in widowed adults' psycholog-
ical adjustment (George & Gwyther, 1984; Norris & Murrell,
1987; Parkes & Weiss, 1983; Vachon et al., 1982). Personality
factors, such as an insecure attachment style or a tendency to
ruminate, also may make some particularly vulnerable to grief
(Fraley & Shaver, 1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, Parker, & Larson,
1994; Van Doorn, Kasl, Beery, Jacobs, & Priegerson, 1998).
A fourth factor--the quality and nature of one's mar-
riage--also may influence psychological reactions to wid-
owhood. The loss of marriages providing the highest levels
of warmth and support may be most distressing to survivors.
The link between relationship closeness and grief is a cen-
tral theme of attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980). Attach-
ment theory holds that when a close emotional bond is sev-
ered--whether through death or separation--the grief process
follows (Bowlby, 1980). The grief process may involve
feelings of sorrow or sadness and anxiety, as well as yearn-
ing for the deceased (Parkes, 1985).
Bowlby's (1980) formulation of the grief process has two
important implications for the study of adjustment to wid-
owhood. First, the model suggests that all losses should not
be equally distressing; the dissolution of emotionally and
socially significant ties may elicit the strongest psychologi-
cal reactions. A second implication of attachment theory is
that individuals display a series of diverse reactions to loss,
including depression, anxiety (or "active distress"), or yearn-
ing for the deceased--an emotional reaction unique to loss.
We examined whether three emotional responses to spousal
death (depression, anxiety, and yearning) were influenced
by three aspects of the marital relationship (closeness, con-
flict, and instrumental dependence).
Marital Quality and Bereavement
The proposition that relationship quality is linked to dif-
ferent grief reactions can be traced back to psychoanalytic
theory. Psychoanalytic theories of grief hold that the loss of
a conflicted relationship is associated with prolonged or
"pathological" grief (Abraham, 1924/1927; Freud, 1917/
1959). Survivors who had ambivalent or difficult relation-
ships with their spouses are believed to have both anger to-
ward and a strong attachment to the deceased. These con-
flicting feelings make it difficult for survivors to let go of
their lost loved one, yet survivors simultaneously are angry
at the deceased for abandoning them (Freud, 1917/1959).
This argument is supported by Parkes and Weiss (1983),
who obtained retrospective assessments of marital quality
among a sample of bereaved adults. Widowed persons who
reported high levels of marital conflict showed relatively lit-
tle distress and higher levels of social participation 6 weeks
after their spouse's death. Yet by 13 months after the death,
those reporting highly conflicted marriages were signifi-
cantly less likely to have returned to effective functioning
and after 24­48 months had higher levels of anxiety, guilt,
and depression than did the low-conflict group.
An important methodological issue weakens the conclu-
sion of Parkes and Weiss (1983), however. Retrospective
assessments of marital relationships were obtained after the
spouse died and thus may be biased positively (Futterman et
al., 1990) or negatively (Hirschfield et al., 1989). Widowed
persons often display a bias toward selective positive recall
when describing their deceased spouses and may "purify"
the memory of the deceased (Lopata, 1973; Parkes &
Weiss, 1983). Conversely, those who are most depressed af-
ter the loss may offer the most negative retrospective ac-
counts of their marriages (Bonanno, Notarius, Gunzerath,
Keltner, & Horowitz, 1998). Depressed individuals evaluate
themselves and their relationships more negatively than do
nondepressed persons (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale,
1978; Beck, 1967; Hirschfield et al., 1989) and are more
likely to recall negative information about past experiences
(Teasdale, Taylor, & Fogarty, 1980).
An important longitudinal study of life transitions poses
an alternative to the psychoanalytic theory of prolonged grief:
Wheaton (1990) countered that exiting a stressful role may
enhance well-being. Although traditional theories of stress
posit that all life transitions (such as spousal deaths or job
losses) are stressful (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), Wheaton
(1990) argued that the impact of an event varies according
to the context in which the transition occurs. Specifically, in
Wheaton's (1990) analysis, bereaved spouses who reported
marital problems at a baseline interview went on to experi-
ence significantly lower levels of distress at follow-up,
compared with those reporting fewer marital problems. We
have built upon the work of Wheaton (1990) in two ways;
we had a larger sample of widowed adults and considered
three distinct aspects of the marital relationship: closeness,
conflict, and instrumental dependence (i.e., reliance on
one's spouse for performing daily tasks). Although the loss
of warm, nonconflictual relationships may be linked to ele-
vated grief and depression, the loss of a marriage providing
high levels of instrumental support may be linked to ele-
vated anxiety among widowed persons. If families are ar-
ranged so that one's spouse is the primary--or only--help-
mate, then the loss of this source of instrumental support
may be distressing (Lopata, 1973; Volkart & Michael,
1957). Drawing from the research and theory discussed thus
far, we proposed the following hypothesis regarding the
mental health of widowed persons and matched controls:
H1: The effect of widowhood on both depression and
anxiety will increase as levels of marital warmth and
instrumental dependence increase and will decrease
as levels of marital conflict increase. That is, the psy-
chological toll of widowhood will be most severe for
those who experienced low levels of conflict, high
levels of warmth, and high levels of instrumental de-
pendence in their marriages at baseline.
We posited the following hypothesis regarding variation in
yearning, a core component of grief, among a sample of
widowed persons only:
H2: Yearning (at 6-month follow-up) will be nega-
tively associated with conflict and positively associ-
ated with warmth­closeness and instrumental depen-
dence (at baseline).
MARITAL QUALITY AND GRIEF IN THE WIDOWED S199
We also explored whether these patterns differ for hus-
bands and wives. The protective effects of marriage are
stronger for men than for women (see Waite, 1995, for a re-
view). Wives are more likely than husbands to have alter-
nate sources of emotional and social support (Antonucci,
1990; Bock & Webber, 1972; Fischer & Phillips, 1982;
Powers & Bultena, 1976; Stroebe & Stroebe, 1983; Stroebe,
Stroebe, & Schut 1997). Women also provide more emo-
tional support to their spouses than do men (Gove, 1973;
Lee, 1988). Men who are in particularly warm and loving
relationships may be more inclined to depend exclusively
on their spouses for support, whereas men in conflicted rela-
tionships may be forced to seek other sources of emotional
intimacy and social support. Thus, high levels of closeness
and low levels of conflict may be stronger predictors of
poor adjustment among widowers than among widows.
Instrumental dependence might also have different ef-
fects on widows' and widowers' adjustment. In current co-
horts of older adults, men receive substantially more instru-
mental advantages from marriage than do women, generally
in the form of household tasks (Hartman, 1981; Miller &
Garrison, 1982). After his wife dies, a widower may be par-
ticularly ill equipped to handle the daily tasks of maintain-
ing a household (Berardo, 1970). Yet widowers also have
two distinct advantages not typically available to widows:
greater economic resources and a larger pool of potential
spousal replacements (Lopata, 1973). Over the life course,
men earn substantially more than women and thus may have
the resources to purchase homemaking services (see Bian-
chi, 1995, for a review). Moreover, because of men's mor-
tality disadvantage, women aged 65 and older outnumber
men aged 65 and older by roughly 1.5 to 1 (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1996). Widowers may easily find companions
to assist with the household tasks previously performed by
their wives (Bengston, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990). Thus,
we hypothesized that:
H3: Marital warmth­closeness will be a stronger pos-
itive predictor of yearning, anxiety, and depression
among men (relative to women).
H4: Conflict will be a stronger negative predictor of
yearning, anxiety, and depression among men (rela-
tive to women).
H5A: Instrumental dependence for male-typed tasks
will be a stronger positive predictor of yearning, anx-
iety, and depression among women (relative to men).
H5B: Instrumental dependence for female-typed tasks
will be a stronger positive predictor of yearning, anx-
iety, and depression among men (relative to women).
Other Influences on Marital Quality and Adjustment to
Spousal Loss
Our analysis included indicators of three other potential
influences on bereavement. First, we controlled mental health
prior to loss to help distinguish one's affective state before
the death and change in affective state that occurred follow-
ing the death (Jacobs, 1993; Zisook & Schucter, 1991). Al-
though most studies have examined prior depression as the
sole indicator of prior mental health, we also considered
anxiety at baseline. Second, the extent to which a presumed
stressor, such as widowhood, affects the individual is linked
to his or her other resources and vulnerabilities. Consequently,
we included controls for socioeconomic status (education,
income, and home ownership) at baseline. Finally, we con-
trolled both spouse's and respondent's physical health at base-
line, because physical health may influence marital quality
at baseline and mental health at 6-month follow-up (Booth
& Johnson, 1994; Wickrama, Lorenz, & Conger, 1997).
METHODS
Sample
The Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study is a
prospective study of a two-stage area probability sample of
1,532 married individuals from the Detroit Standard Metro-
politan Statistical Area (SMSA). To be eligible for the
study, respondents had to be English-speaking members of
a married couple in which the husband was aged 65 or
older. All sample members were not institutionalized and
were capable of participating in a 2-hour interview. Approx-
imately 65% of those contacted for an interview partici-
pated, which is consistent with the response rate from other
Detroit area studies. Baseline face-to-face interviews were
conducted from June 1987 through April 1988.
CLOC researchers monitored spousal loss by reading the
daily obituaries in three Detroit-area newspapers and by us-
ing monthly death record tapes provided by the State of
Michigan. The National Death Index (NDI) was used to
confirm deaths and obtain causes of death. Of the 319 re-
spondents who lost a spouse during the study, 86% (n 
276) participated in at least one of the three follow-up inter-
views, which were conducted 6 months (Wave 1), 18
months (Wave 2), and 48 months (Wave 3) after the death.
The primary reasons for nonresponse were refusal to partic-
ipate (38%) and ill health or death at follow-up (42%). Con-
trols from the original sample of 1,545 were selected to
match the widowed persons along the dimensions of age,
race, and sex. The matched controls were reinterviewed at
the three follow-up interviews at roughly the same time as
their corresponding widowed persons.
We used two analytic samples in this study. The first in-
cluded 290 persons (75 men and 215 women) who were in-
terviewed at the 6-month follow-up and comprised 203 wid-
owed persons and 87 matched controls. (Controls were not
available for all bereaved subjects at the 6-month follow-up
because funding for the control sample was cut from the
proposed budget and was reinstated halfway through the
data collection for the 6-month follow-up). The second sam-
ple included the 203 bereaved persons (53 men and 150
women) interviewed at the 6-month followup, or roughly
64% of the 319 respondents who lost a spouse.
Measures
Dependent variables.--In the first part of the analysis,
which contrasted the widowed and matched controls, we fo-
cused on two dimensions of mental health at the 6-month
S200 CARR ET AL.
follow-up: depression and anxiety. Depression (  .83)
was assessed with a subset of 9 negative items from the 20-
item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D)
scale (Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked to indicate
how often they experienced each of nine symptoms in the
week prior to interview. Response categories were "hardly
ever," "some of the time," or "most of the time." The nine
symptoms were (a) "I felt depressed"; (b) "I felt that every-
thing I did was an effort"; (c) "My sleep was restless"; (d) "I
felt lonely"; (e) "People were unfriendly"; (f) "I did not feel
like eating. My appetite was poor"; (g) "I felt sad"; (h) "I felt
that people disliked me"; and (i) "I could not `get going.'"
Anxiety (  .86) was assessed with 10 items from the
Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (Derogatis & Cleary, 1977).
Respondents were asked to indicate how often they experi-
enced each of 10 symptoms in the week prior to interview.
Response categories were "not at all," "a little bit," "moder-
ately," "quite a bit," and "extremely." Symptoms included
(a) "nervousness or shakiness"; (b) "trembling"; (c) "feeling
suddenly scared for no reason"; (d) "feeling fearful"; (e)
"heart pounding or racing"; (f) "feeling tense and keyed
up"; (g) "spells of terror and panic"; (h) "feeling so restless
you couldn't sit still"; (i) "feeling that something bad is go-
ing to happen to you"; and (j) "thoughts and images of a
frightening nature." For ease of interpretation, depression
and anxiety scores were standardized and thus had a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
In the second part of the analysis we focused on widowed
persons only and examined the correlates of yearning, con-
sidered a "core" symptom of grief (Bowlby, 1980; Parkes,
1985). Attachment theory holds that the essential dimension
of grief that distinguishes bereavement from other forms of
emotional distress is the act of pining for the lost person.
Yearning reflects an intermittent, recurrent, and obtrusive
wish or need to recover the person who has died. Yearning
(  .75) was assessed with four questions: "In the last
month (a) have you found yourself longing to have your
spouse with you; (b) have you had painful waves of missing
your spouse; (c) have you experienced feelings of intense
pain or grief over the loss of your spouse; and (d) have you
experienced feelings of grief, loneliness, or missing your
spouse?" Response categories were "no, never"; "yes, but
rarely"; "yes, sometimes"; and "yes, often." Items were
drawn from widely used grief scales including the Bereave-
ment Index (Jacobs, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1986), Present Feel-
ings About Loss (Singh & Raphael, 1981), and Texas Re-
vised Inventory of Grief (Zisook, DeVaul, & Click, 1982).
Independent variables.--Widowhood was a dummy vari-
able set equal to 1 indicating those who were widowed be-
tween the baseline interview and the 6-month follow-up.
Three dimensions of the marital relationship were consid-
ered: warmth­closeness, instrumental dependence (for both
male- and female-typed tasks), and conflict. These three di-
mensions were chosen because they capture two of the most
important functions of marriage for older adults: intimacy
and interdependence (Atchley, 1985). A fourth dimension,
emotional dependence, was considered, but it was not sig-
nificantly related to psychological adjustment in the multi-
variate analysis and was thus dropped from the study.
Questions assessing each of the marital domains were
drawn from a modified version of the Dyadic Adjustment
Scale (Spanier, 1976). Respondents were asked to assess the
frequency with which they experienced a given condition
(response categories were "almost always," "often," some-
times," "rarely," and "never") or how true a given statement
was in characterizing their marital relationship (response
categories were "very true," "somewhat true," "a little true,"
and "not at all true"). Total scores equalled the scale-spe-
cific average (standardized) across items. Italicized items
(see next paragraph) were reverse-coded.
Warmth­closeness (  .88) was assessed with a seven-
item scale with the following questions: (a) "How much
does your spouse make you feel loved and cared for"; (b)
"How much is your spouse willing to listen when you need
to talk about your worries and problems?"; (c) "There are
some serious difficulties in our marriage"; (d) "Thinking
about your marriage as a whole, how often do you feel
happy about it?"; (e) "Taking all things together, how satis-
fied are you with your marriage?"; (f) "How often do you
feel bothered or upset by your marriage?"; (g) "My spouse
doesn't treat me as well as I deserve to be treated."
Conflict (alpha  .64) was assessed with a two-item scale
comprising the items (a) "How often would you say you and
your spouse typically have unpleasant disagreements and
conflicts?" and (b) "In some marriages there are times when
you feel very close, but other times when you can get more
upset with that person than with anyone else. How much
does this sound like the relationship you have with your
spouse?"
Instrumental dependence was measured with the follow-
ing questions. "Husbands and wives often depend on one
another to handle different responsibilities. At the present
time, how much do you depend on your spouse to handle or
help with: (a) home maintenance and minor repairs; (b)
keeping up with checking and savings accounts and paying
bills; (c) making major financial and legal decisions; and (d)
preparing meals and doing general housework and laundry."
Response categories were "a lot," "some," "a little," and
"not at all." Factor analyses yielded one three-item subscale
(  .54), which tapped male-typed tasks (Items 1­3), and a
single-item measure that tapped female-typed tasks (Item 4).
Confounding factors.--Spousal health at baseline was
assessed with the question "Has your [spouse] had a serious
illness, injury, surgery, or accident in the past 12 months?"
Depression and anxiety at baseline were measured exactly
the same way as the 6-month follow-up measures (Deroga-
tis & Cleary, 1977; Radloff, 1977). Respondents' physical
health at baseline was assessed with the question "How sat-
isfied are you with your health?" Responses were "com-
pletely satisfied," "very satisfied," "somewhat satisfied," "not
very satisfied," and "not at all satisfied." A dummy variable
was set equal to 1 for those who said they were "not very
satisfied" or "not at all satisfied" with their health.
Other potential predictors of psychological adjustment to
loss, including race, marital duration, social support from
friends, social support from relatives, religiosity, self-esteem,
and provision of care to spouse prior to death, were included
in preliminary analyses but were dropped because they were
MARITAL QUALITY AND GRIEF IN THE WIDOWED S201
not significant predictors of the psychological adjustment ( p 
.05) and because inclusion of these variables did not alter
the effects of marital quality on psychological adjustment.
Control variables.--Control variables included: age, sex
(where 1  "female"), home ownership at baseline (a di-
chotomous variable where 1  "owns home"), total house-
hold income at baseline (natural log of income), and educa-
tion (a continuous measure ranging from 3 to 17 years of
completed schooling). The total household income variable
was originally measured by asking respondents to indicate
which of 10 income categories most accurately character-
ized their economic status. A continuous measure of income
was derived by taking the midpoint of each of the 10 in-
come categories. The natural log of income was used in this
analysis because the respondents' income distribution was
heavily skewed toward the lower income categories.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Descriptive statistics and t tests comparing means for the
widowed and matched controls are presented in Table 1.
Zero-order correlations among the dependent variables, mari-
tal quality indicators, and baseline mental health measures
are displayed in Table 2. Table 1 shows that widowed per-
sons had significantly higher depression levels at the 6-month
follow-up, yet they did not differ from matched controls in
terms of anxiety. The spouses of widowed persons were sig-
nificantly more likely to have had a serious illness at base-
line, and widowed persons reported significantly lower levels
of dependence on their spouses for male- and female-typed
instrumental tasks at baseline. Widowed persons and con-
trols did not differ significantly in terms of marital warmth
or conflict. The widowed also had slightly lower incomes
and were less likely to own their own homes. These differ-
ences likely reflect effects of the spouse's declining health
before death.
The zero-order correlations displayed in Table 2 were
largely as expected. Depression and anxiety were positively
and significantly correlated, although this relationship was
stronger at the 6-month follow-up (.626) than at baseline
(.477). Among the marital quality indicators, conflict and
warmth were strongly and negatively correlated (.587),
although conflict was not significantly related to instrumen-
tal dependence. Baseline depression and anxiety were sig-
nificantly correlated with only two dimensions of baseline
marital quality: warmth and conflict. Yearning at the 6-month
follow-up was significantly correlated with concurrent de-
pression (.492) and anxiety (.238), yet these values suggest
that the three dimensions of mental health are conceptually
and statistically distinct.
Influence of Marital Quality on Mental Health of the
Widowed and Nonwidowed
Our main objective in this analysis was to explore
whether the mental health consequences of widowhood
(i.e., depression and anxiety at a 6-month follow-up) were
related to marital quality, assessed at baseline. Table 3 pre-
sents ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models for the
total sample (i.e., both widows and matched controls).
Model 1 showed the effect of widowhood on depression,
and Model 2 estimated the effect of widowhood on anxiety,
before controlling marital quality. Models 1 and 2 revealed
that widowhood was associated with poorer psychological
well being (net of demographic and contextual factors). Be-
fore marital quality was controlled, widowhood was associ-
ated with a .729 standard deviation increase in depression
and a .116 standard deviation increase in anxiety scores.
The effect of widowhood on depression did not change ap-
preciably after marital quality variables were added to the
model as moderators. However, the effect of widowhood on
anxiety was no longer significant when instrumental depen-
dence was incorporated into the analysis, suggesting that the
anxiety may be due to the loss of practical assistance with
daily demands.
We then expanded each model to include two-way inter-
actions between widowhood status and each of the marital
quality indicators. A significant interaction term suggests
that the consequences of widowhood vary on the basis of

marital quality. Of the eight two-way interaction terms, only
one was statistically significant at the p  .05 level: Instru-
mental dependence for male-typed tasks moderated the ef-
fect of widowhood on anxiety (see Model 3). We added a
three-way interaction term to Model 3 to assess whether the
widowhood status by instrumental dependence effect dif-
fered for men and women; the three-way interaction was not
statistically significant at the p  .05 level. The statistically
significant interaction effect (net of independent variables
presented in Table 3, with all independent variables set
equal to sample mean) is plotted in Figure 1.
Model 3 and Figure 1 show that widowhood was associ-
ated with higher levels of anxiety among those who re-
ported average or higher levels of dependence on their
spouse for performing male-typed instrumental tasks. Wid-
owhood was actually associated with slightly lower levels
of anxiety (compared with controls) among those who had
low levels of dependence on their spouse at baseline.
Influence of Marital Quality on Bereavement
Next, we assessed whether yearning for one's spouse (at
the 6-month follow-up) was affected by the quality of one's
marriage, assessed at baseline. Table 4 presents OLS regres-
sion models estimating the effects of marital quality on wid-
owed persons' yearning. Model 1 was the baseline model,
which included demographic, health, and control variables

but no marital quality indicators. Model 2 incorporated mar-
ital warmth­closeness; Model 3 adjusted for marital con-
flict; Model 4 assessed the influence of instrumental depen-
dence, and Model 5 included the baseline model plus all
marital quality indicators. Marital quality played an impor-
tant role in explaining variability in widowed persons'
yearning. Although Model 1 accounted for only 3% of the
variance in yearning, the inclusion of individual marital
quality items increased the adjusted R2 to anywhere from 6
to 8%, depending on the specific marital domain. The final
model, which included the three measures of marital qual-
ity, explained 12% of the variance in yearning.
As hypothesized, adjustment to widowhood was most
difficult for those who experienced the highest levels of
emotional warmth and instrumental dependence in their
marriages. Each standard deviation increase in warmth­
closeness was associated with a .28 standard deviation in-
crease in levels of widowed persons' yearning (p  .001).
Those who suffered conflicted marriages evidenced lower
levels of yearning; each standard deviation increase in the
level of conflict in one's marriage decreased yearning levels
by .17 standard deviation units (p  .01). To assess the
claim that the loss of a conflicted relationship is associated
with delayed grief (Freud, 1917/1959), we also estimated
Model 3 for yearning at Wave 2 (18-month follow-up) and
Wave 3 (48-month follow-up). In these additional models
(data not shown), the effects of baseline marital conflict on
Wave 2 and Wave 3 yearning were virtually identical to the
effects found for Wave 1 yearning, suggesting that those in
conflicted marriages did not experience delayed yearning;
rather, they experienced better adjustment in both the long
and the short term following widowhood.
Interestingly, dependence on one's spouse for performing
male-typed tasks increased yearning significantly ( 
.270, p  .01), yet reliance on one's spouse for performing
female-typed tasks was not significantly linked to yearning.
However, as might be expected, this pattern varied by gen-
der. Model 4 was expanded to include interaction terms for
both types of instrumental dependence by sex; the model
adjusted R2 increased from .064 to .089, and results showed
that dependence on one's spouse for performing male-typed
tasks influenced yearning differently for men and women.
Each standard deviation increase in instrumental depen-
dence for male-typed tasks was associated with a .214 de-
crease in men's yearning but a .385 increase in women's
yearning. The interaction term (net of all other independent
variables, with values of all independent variables set equal
to sample mean) is plotted in Figure 2. None of the other
marital quality indicators interacted significantly with sex.

We estimated a final model (Model 5) to assess the ef-
fects of the four marital quality indicators simultaneously.
Although the coefficients and levels of statistical signifi-
cance declined somewhat when all four marital quality indi-
cators were controlled, the results nonetheless revealed im-
portant linkages between marital quality and yearning. The
effects of warmth and conflict each declined by 40 and
30%, respectively, whereas the effect of dependence on
spouse for male-typed tasks decreased by 8%. However,
given the relatively small sample size (n  203) and a
strong correlation between warmth and conflict (r  .587;
see Table 2), it is notable that the instrumental dependence
(for male-typed tasks) indicator was still significant at the p 
.01 level, and the warmth and conflict indicators ap-
proached statistical significance (p  .10). The strength of
these findings is noteworthy, given that potential sources of
marital conflict and closeness, including spousal health, so-
cioeconomic indicators, and baseline indicators of negative
affect (i.e., anxiety and depression levels), were controlled.
Few other variables were significant predictors of yearn-
ing. Anxiety at baseline was associated with elevated levels
of yearning at the 6-month follow-up, although baseline de-
pression was unrelated to Wave 1 yearning. Interestingly,
greater economic resources at baseline were positively asso-
ciated with yearning. Those who owned their own home at
baseline had significantly higher levels of yearning. Perhaps
those who did not own a home experienced greater levels of
social integration with neighbors in an apartment complex
or retirement community. It is unlikely that homeowners at
baseline experienced the loss of their home or relocation
following their spouse's death; only 5% of homeowners at
baseline were no longer homeowners at Wave 1. Moreover,
household income at baseline was positively associated
with yearning. This finding is surprising given the vast
amount of research documenting an inverse relationship be-
tween socioeconomic status and diverse indicators of nega-
tive mental health (Dohrenwend, Levav, & Shrout, 1992). It
is possible that those with the lowest income at baseline ex-
perienced the smallest relative declines in their standard of
living following the loss of their spouse (see Holden &
Smock, 1991, for a review), and thus may not have had to
cope with the combined loss of both spouse and economic
status simultaneously.
DISCUSSION
In this study we expanded upon prior research in four
ways. First, we used prospective data to examine the effects
of marital quality (at baseline) on mental health at a 6-month
follow-up; thus, assessments of marital quality were not af-
fected by positive (Futterman et al., 1990; Lopata, 1975) or
negative (Abramson et al., 1978; Hirschfield et al., 1989)
recall bias. Second, we considered three conceptually and
statistically distinct aspects of the marital relationship:
closeness, conflict, and instrumental dependence. Third, we
focused on both men and women and assessed whether the
link between marital quality and psychological adjustment
differed significantly for the two sexes. Finally, we included
widowed persons and a control group to address an impor-
tant issue previously neglected in studies of widowhood:
Does the effect of widowhood on psychological adjustment
vary on the basis of the nature of the marital relationship?
We found that widowhood is a significant predictor of
depression and that this large and significant effect does not
decline when marital quality indicators are incorporated
into the analysis. In contrast, the effect of widowhood on
anxiety is no longer statistically significant when levels of
instrumental dependence are considered. This finding high-
lights the importance of considering the unique pathways
through which loss influences both "passive depression"
and "active distress." Although the loss of one's partner, re-
gardless of relationship quality, may be associated with ele-
vated sadness and depression, anxiety may instead be a re-
action to the loss of a partner when accompanied by major
changes in daily responsibilities and burdens.
Our analyses showed that the effect of widowhood on
anxiety levels varies by how much one depended on one's
spouse for performing male-typed tasks, such as home re-
pair and financial management. Compared with the married
controls, widowed persons who reported high levels of de-
pendence on their spouse had significantly higher levels of
anxiety at follow-up. This is not surprising; those who were
not dependent on their spouses presumably are better able to
care for themselves and maintain their households success-
fully following the loss of their spouse. In contrast, among
married controls, lack of dependence on one's spouse may
signify an uncooperative marriage. Because spouse's health
at baseline is controlled, low levels of dependence on one's
spouse are not attributable to poor spousal health.
Yearning, considered a core component of grief, is signif-
icantly and strongly affected by marital quality. Consistent
with attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980), our findings sug-
gest that all losses are not equal; adjustment to widowhood
is most difficult for those experiencing high levels of
warmth and instrumental dependence and low levels of con-
flict in their marriages. Our findings support Wheaton's
(1990) assertion that role histories must be considered when
researchers are examining life transitions. Although classic
studies of stressful life events implicitly assume that all life
events can overtax individuals' coping resources and leave
them emotionally vulnerable (Holmes & Rahe, 1967), our
findings suggest that the impact of a stressor depends on the
context surrounding the event.
Although studies of divorce demonstrate that those exit-
ing troubled marriages are less susceptible to depression
(Aseltine & Kessler, 1993; Kitson & Sussman, 1982), we
know of no other prospective studies linking marital con-
flict to adjustment following widowhood. Moreover, pre-
liminary analyses of the CLOC follow-up data reveal that
this relationship holds when yearning is assessed at 18 and
48 months following the loss. Our findings do not support
Freud's (1917/1959) claim that the loss of a conflicted rela-
tionship leads to delayed grief. However, our analyses did
not focus on extreme levels of grief, nor on long-term hori-
zons (beyond 4 years); further analyses are needed to under-
stand linkages between marital conflict and delayed grief.
Although we expected to find that conflict and closeness
would have larger effects on men's adjustment, given that
marriage has greater protective effects for men (Waite,
1995), we instead found no significant gender difference.
MARITAL QUALITY AND GRIEF IN THE WIDOWED S205
We found support for our hypothesis that dependence on a
spouse for male-typed tasks would be a stronger predictor
of anxiety for women, although we did not find dependence
on one's spouse for female-typed tasks to affect widows and
widowers differently. In fact, dependence on one's spouse
for performing homemaking tasks was not a significant pre-
dictor of yearning.
These findings tell an interesting story about gender, de-
pendence, and socialization in current cohorts of older
adults. Current cohorts of older widowers may not need the
same amount of informal support as do widows, because of
early socialization experiences (Stevens, 1995). The devel-
opment of personal attributes such as independence and
self-reliance may have been imbued in young men, but not
young women, of the CLOC cohort. Future generations of
older women, who have higher levels of education, more
years of work experience, and more egalitarian divisions of
labor in their families (Bianchi, 1995), may be less suscepti-
ble to dependence on their husbands for home repair and fi-
nancial management tasks. Under such a scenario, gender
differences in widows' and widowers' anxiety levels might
be expected to decline among future cohorts of elderly.
Yet, at the same time, our findings suggest that adapta-
tion to spousal loss may become more difficult in future co-
horts. The members of the CLOC sample belong to a cohort
who experienced relatively low levels of divorce and sepa-
ration, given both the social stigma accompanying divorce
and the dearth of opportunities for women to provide for
themselves economically in earlier decades (Cherlin, 1981;
Holden & Smock, 1991). Thus, men and women of this co-
hort may have remained in marriages that provided rela-
tively low levels of warmth and relatively high levels of
conflict. If current cohorts of married couples are more
likely to dissolve dissatisfying marriages, then those who
remain married until late life may have higher levels of mar-
ital satisfaction and thus may suffer more following the loss
of these close relationships.
Future research on the linkages between marital quality
and adjustment to loss should consider whether both spouses
share similar assessments of the marriage at baseline and
whether psychological adjustment to loss differs on the ba-
sis of whose report of the marriage is being considered. Pre-
liminary analyses of the CLOC data reveal quite low corre-
lations between respondents' and spouses' assessments of
marital quality (most are less than .3), with the exception of
marital conflict. Spouses' assessments of marital conflict are
highly correlated (.473), and (the deceased) spouses' base-
line reports of marital conflict are a significant negative pre-
dictor of their survivors' adjustment to loss. In contrast, sur-
vivors' psychological adjustment is not affected by their
spouses' reports of dependence or warmth, suggesting that
it is a person's own perceptions and feelings about his or her
spouse that are related to bereavement.
Our findings are potentially important to the sociological
study of life transitions. If all life transitions--especially
highly anticipated ones such as widowhood in old age--are
viewed as distressing (e.g., Holmes & Rahe, 1967), then
rigid normative expectations for the expression of emotion
may be imposed on the individual (Averill, 1968). Wid-
owed persons' failure to comply with normative expres-
sions of grief, such as yearning for a deceased spouse, are
socially (and subtly) sanctioned: A denial of grief may "en-
tail a rejection of the original assumption that the relation-
ship was meaningful and close. The other alternative would
be to consider the lack of response as a sign of actual or po-
tential pathology" (Averill, 1968, p. 732). By considering
one's role history prior to spousal death, variations in be-
reavement may be better understood.
Our findings also have important implications for practi-
tioners. Our data help identify a population at particularly
high risk for anxiety--wives who were highly dependent on
their spouses for performing instrumental tasks. The provi-
sion of instrumental assistance and practical support with
daily activities and chores may help to alleviate their anxi-
ety. Our results further suggest that not all bereaved persons
experience similar levels of depression, anxiety, and yearn-
ing following the loss of a spouse. To the contrary, psycho-
logical adjustment to widowhood varies considerably on the
basis of the nature of one's marriage. Because the grief pro-
cess varies in timing, intensity, and difficulty from one per-
son to the next, what helps one person cope with grief may
not be helpful to another. Thus, interventions should be tai-
lored to the bereaved person's circumstances and needs.
