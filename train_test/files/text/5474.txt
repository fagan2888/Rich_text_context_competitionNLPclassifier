Musculoskeletal pain from osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent
concern for older adults (Bellamy & Buchanan, 1986; Zhang
& Jordan, 2008). Pain is a primary reason for the majority of
people living with OA to seek treatment (Donovan & Blake,
1992; M. Morgan & Watkins, 1988). According to the work
of Sanders, Donovan, and Dieppe (2002) on the social sig-
nificance of OA, "issues of identity and biography are cen-
tral to the meanings ascribed to illness and aging" (p. 247).
Intervention is often sought for OA once symptoms are "per-
ceived to interfere with life," indicating a need to gain a
deeper understanding about how OA pain affects the lives of
people (Campbell et al., 2001).
Because regular physical activity decreases OA pain over
time, it is included in clinical practice treatment guidelines
(Conaghan, Dickson, & Grant, 2008; Richmond et al., 2010).
However, therapeutic exercise for OA can acutely increase
pain (Badley & Papageorgiou, 1989; Farrell, Gibson,
McMeeken, & Helme, 2000; Focht, Ewing, & Gauvin,
2002). Therefore, people with OA must decide whether to
begin or continue exercise when activity-related pain is
expected or occurs. Confusion about the meaning of activity-
related pain can be a barrier to effective treatment (Clarke,
Moreton, das Nair, Walsh, & Lincoln, 2014); people with OA
frequently report fear and avoidance of activity when they
believe that exercise will further damage their joints or activ-
ity is to blame for their condition (Hendry, Williams,
Markland, Wilkinson, & Maddison, 2006; Thorstensson,
Roos, Petersson, & Arvidsson, 2006).
Recent work has highlighted the underlying complexities
associated with characterizing the relationship between pain,
fear, and activity avoidance. For example, McCracken and
Samuel (2007) reported that some patients with chronic pain
report both high levels of physical activity and high levels of
activityavoidancedependinguponthesituation.Furthermore,
work by Kindermans and colleagues (2011) described two
types of avoidance patterns and three types of persistence
patterns of physical activity in people with chronic pain. The
need to individualize self-management programs has been
emphasized in the literature, due to a growing recognition
that both the ability and desire for activity do not necessarily
remain consistent throughout the life course (Moore,
Richardson, Sim, Bernard, & Jordan, 2014; Ong, Jinks, &
Morden, 2011). Based on these complicated findings, greater
clarification of the contextual and individual factors that
influence activity behavior is needed.
Research has only recently begun to consider the role of
social and other contextual factors in the decisions of patients
with chronic pain to persist in therapeutic exercise. For
example, Mackichan, Adamson, and Gooberman-Hill (2013)
highlighted the importance of issues such as the patient's

Osteoarthritis and Social Embarrassment:
Risk, Pain, and Avoidance

Abstract
Musculoskeletal pain from osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent concern for older adults. Despite recommendations from
providers to be physically active, some people with OA fear physical activity and must decide whether it is safe or harmful
to undertake physical activity. In this article, we examined the narratives of 10 people living with OA knee pain and the
roles that pain and embarrassment played in their activity-related behavior. When asked about their physical activity, 6 of
the 10 participants reported some type of embarrassment-related experience. Responses fell into two key categories: (a)
embarrassment-related experience from engaging in activity or (b) embarrassment-related experience from avoiding activity.
These categories contained subgroups of those seeking to avoid embarrassment and those seeking to avoid pain. Response
clusters helped to contextualize the activity behavior of people with knee OA pain as it relates to social identity by providing
examples of individuals resisting life disruption.

own explanations for his or her activity avoidance in contrast
to the fear avoidance models commonly used to explain
changes in the activity levels of older adults. Also, Torres's
(2013) research team suggested that "persistence" with a
physical activity exists to "avoid" social disapproval. In
addition, Graham, Kremer, and Wheeler (2008) described
how people with chronic diseases such as arthritis believe
that physical activity facilitates maintenance of their
identity.
The existing literature on identity and personhood can
also provide guidance on the role social factors play in cases
of chronic pain. For example, social identity or personhood
is "bestowed by society" and has to be "earned by achieving
and maintaining expected social roles and ideals" (Luborsky,
1994, p. 240). Physical disabilities and impairments can con-
tribute to the "diminishment of identity as a social person"
(Armstrong & Fitzgerald, 1996, p. 274). Current research on
embarrassment, identity, and pain indicates that medical con-
ditions, which hinder function, occupation, independent liv-
ing, and physical appearance, can diminish an individual's
sense of self (Hill, Dziedzic, & Ong, 2010; Kaptein et al.,
2013; Keysor, Sparling, & Riegger-Krugh, 1998; M. Morgan
& Watkins, 1988).
Social identity may be affected by contextual factors,
such as expectations (Moore et al., 2014). Older adult
patients as well as their health care providers expected
increased pain with aging, and may not interpret the OA
joint pain and stiffness as something requiring medical
intervention (Grime, Richardson, & Ong, 2010; Hendry et
al., 2006). These beliefs may negatively affect their pain
management and motivation for full engagement in activity
(Davis, Hiemenz, & White, 2002). Cultural and genera-
tional expectations that go unmet or unrealized can lead to
the "experience of inner chaos and disruption" (Becker,
1994, p. 383). Disruption related to chronic pain has been
shown to challenge the way people define themselves and
change their health-related decision making (Fenwick,
Chaboyer, & St John, 2012). Discrepancies between ideal-
ized and other "versions" of oneself can be a source of dis-
tress among people living with chronic pain and may offer
insights into the motivations behind pain-related behavior
(Huijnen et al., 2011). Similar insights may be gained from
a clearer understanding of how individuals define the con-
cept of risk, especially as it relates to health-related behav-
ior (Zinn, 2005).
Embarrassment is the feeling of self-consciousness,
inadequacy, shame, and awkwardness in social situations or
in public. Little is known about how embarrassment may
influence physical activity patterns in the context of pain,
life disruption, and threats to personhood. To address this,
we examined the narratives of 10 people living with OA
knee pain as part of a larger ongoing mixed-methods proj-
ect. This article focuses on the role that social pressure and
embarrassment played in their activity-related decision
making.
Method
This study was part of an ongoing mixed-methods research
project, which was approved by our university Institutional
Review Board to discover and document the relationships
among OA knee pain, physical activity, and emotions. The
mean age of the participants (N = 10) was 60 (SD = 10.40
years), and 70% of the sample were women, as is appropri-
ate given the increased likelihood and severity of OA in
women (O'Connor, 2007). Ninety percent of the sample
described themselves as Caucasian. We used the following
inclusion criteria: (a) 40 years old or older, (b) community
dwelling, (c) self-reported physician diagnosis of unilateral
or bilateral knee OA, (d) unilateral or bilateral knee pain
that increases with ascending and/or descending stairs, (e)
recommended to begin an exercise program by a health care
provider, (f) on a stable medication regime for 6 weeks, and
(g) able to provide a physician clearance to participate in
lower extremity resistance training. The exclusion criteria
are the following: (a) unstable medical conditions, (b) hip or
knee arthroplasty, (c) inability to independently transfer
with or without assistive device, (d) wheelchair dependence,
(e) body mass index  35, (f) <18 of 22 on telephone version
of Mini-Mental State Examination (Roccaforte, Burke,
Bayer, & Wengel, 1992), (g) regular participation in a lower
extremity resistance training program within the last year,
(h) lower extremity intra-articular injections in the previous
6 months, and (i) regular substance abuse within the previ-
ous 6 months.
Volunteers who met the above-mentioned inclusion crite-
ria completed three lab visits, which lasted about 2 hr each.
At the initial visit, participants provided informed consent
and completed questionnaires about demographics, health
history, and self-care behaviors, including medications and
overall physical activity. After the questionnaires were com-
pleted (during first visit), participants were invited to describe
experiences that explained or supported their responses to
the questionnaires via interview. The second and third lab
visits were held with 1 month in between, participants'
height, weight, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) were mea-
sured again and they were asked to repeat the questionnaires
about their self-care behavior, physical activity, and knee
pain. In addition, they were asked to recall their knee pain
from previous sessions. Furthermore, they completed five
physical activities with activity-specific assessments of
expected, actual, and recalled pain, harm, fear, and the prob-
ability that they would repeat the activity if it had been rec-
ommended by a health care provider.
The data described here were based on interviews by
trained research assistants to explore participants' decision-
making process for appraising the safety of activity-related
knee pain. These interviews were conducted during the first
lab visit and were digitally recorded for subsequent tran-
scription. An investigator (first author) inductively analyzed
the interview transcripts to identify and code themes using a
Kabel et al. 3
grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006) or constant comparative
method. This thematic analysis produced the key findings
upon which our study results were based.
Results
When asked questions about living with OA knee pain, par-
ticularly issues of physical activity, and emotions such as
fear, frustration, and embarrassment, 6 of the 10 participants
self-identified as having some type of embarrassment-related
experience, usually general embarrassment and frustration
over their physical limitations due to the OA pain. When
explicitly asked about embarrassment, responses fell into
two basic categories: (a) embarrassment-related experience
from engaging in activity or (b) embarrassment-related expe-
rience from avoiding activity. Within these two categories
were nested subgroups of those seeking to avoid embarrass-
ment and those seeking to avoid pain. The term risk is used
throughout the "Results" section. In these instances, risk
means the chance of exposing oneself to an unfortunate or
unwelcome outcome (e.g., the risk of social exclusion or the
risk of acute physical pain).
Risk Pain and Embarrassment
When asked about OA knee pain and embarrassment, one
participant shared that she continued to be physically
active in her community, although she was concerned that
others perceived her as being far older than her chrono-
logical age. For her, embarrassment came while " . . . get-
ting up and down in a restaurant or in church . . . it's like
I'm 80 years old instead of 52." Another woman recalled
feeling embarrassment when she attempted to hike on a
vacation with friends in the American Pacific Northwest
but dropped out: "We were with . . . six other people, close
friends that we've known for years, and I really couldn't
keep going."
Risk Pain, Avoid Embarrassment
Participants also gave examples of persisting with a pain-
ful activity and risking intensifying the pain because of
social pressure or the desire to avoid embarrassment and
disapproval, self-imposed or otherwise. Comments such
as "Well, I was walking with a couple that came to visit
and I was really in pain and I just kept going . . . I didn't
want to cop out." Similarly, this example from a yoga
enthusiast:
I was doing yoga last night and there was this awkward position
and uh I sort of was reluctant and I had a feeling it was something
I shouldn't be doing but I kind of wanted to fit in and I still did
it, and uh I mean it wasn't a traumatic injury, but I was a little bit
sore and just tender and fairly immediately knew that I had
probably made a mistake.
Avoid Pain, Risk Embarrassment
Two participants, who were both hikers, reported limiting
effects of OA knee pain and risking embarrassment to avoid/
end pain. The first example comes from a participant who
avoided pain by slowing down while hiking, and as a result,
could not keep up with her companions. She continued the
hike but did not feel comfortable pushing herself to keep
pace with her family: "I couldn't keep up with everyone else
and felt like I was dragging them behind or they felt like they
were with an old woman." A second hiking example came
from a participant who accompanied friends to a local hiking
attraction, only to discover her knee was not up to it:
. . . I only walked until we got to the first set of stairs and then I
just stuck around and waited for the rest of the crew to come
back so, I wasn't even going to try and attempt all those stairs. I
knew I would never make it.
Avoid Pain and Embarrassment
A grandmother shared fears and concerns regarding drop-
ping or falling on her grandchildren due to both hand and
knee pain. She wished to avoid the pain and embarrassment
and in this case, possibly harming loved ones, by avoiding
this very meaningful activity: "I'd hate to fall on one of those
babies or drop one of them . . . . " One male participant
expressed embarrassment due to his wish that he " . . . could
play (basketball) better . . . I wish I could make the cuts and
jump and you know, rebound." He described sitting out and
just shooting hoops rather than playing basketball with his
friends. He engaged in modified activity, not playing as
aggressively as he wanted to, to avoid pain but did not opt
out of the activity completely.
Discussion
This study focused on embarrassment in the context of life
disruption, physical activity, and personhood in people with
knee OA. This socially contextualized approach informs our
perspective of the intersections of identity, risk, and pain.
Participants were explicitly asked about embarrassment and
knee OA, and 6 out of our 10 participants reported some type
of embarrassment-related experience. They shared that they
risked embarrassment by avoiding activity to the disappoint-
ment of themselves or their peers, or they risked embarrass-
ment by engaging in modified or uncompleted activity. These
participants encountered situations where their OA knee pain
threatened to disrupt their sense of self and sense of person-
hood by interfering with or preventing the pursuits and activ-
ities they found meaningful. The participant narratives
provided a context to better understand the role of embar-
rassment within the complex patterns of pain-related physi-
cal activity. The subgroups of responses, which vary by risk
and avoidance of pain and physical activity, helped to
4 SAGE Open
illuminate the influence of embarrassment within the physi-
cal activity avoidance and persistence phenomena.
The participants revealed both individually as well as
socially relevant experiences and frustration [an individual
orientation] and embarrassment [a social orientation] over
the OA knee pain, particularly regarding the physical limita-
tions accompanying the pain. For example, the woman who
attempted to hike, but was forced to sit idle, as well as the
participant who was concerned about looking "old" in church
each risked both pain and embarrassment by attempting to
engage in meaningful activities. They had to adjust their
expectations of their abilities and themselves. These adjust-
ments described by our participants reflected the findings of
Hill et al. (2010) on hand OA and identity, Morgan's (2006)
study on hip pain and mobility challenges, and a study on
chronic pain management barriers by Davis et al. (2002).
Participants in these studies reported embarrassment, disap-
pointment about looking "old," self-perceived threats to dig-
nity and social identity due to pain, compromised mobility,
and dependence on adaptive devices (Davis et al., 2002; Hill
et al., 2010; R. Morgan, 2006). Interestingly, however, some
of the individuals in our study (e.g., one of the hikers and the
church-goer) did not opt out of physical activities, indicating
a reluctance to count themselves out of meaningful pursuits.
This reluctance hints at a larger tension between the abilities
of the idealized version of themselves and their actual physi-
cal capacities, as well as the desire to maintain social
participation.
Participants who reported persisting with a painful activ-
ity for fear of embarrassment or disapproval mirrored the
persistent chronic pain patients described by quantitative
investigations in the literature (e.g., Kindermans et al., 2011;
Torres et al., 2013). Multiple, co-existing interpretations of
how chronic pain may disrupt the life course and yet be con-
sidered a normal or expected part of the aging process have
been documented in previous studies (Sanders et al., 2002).
For instance, the behavior of the yoga enthusiast who " . . .
had a feeling it was something I shouldn't be doing but I kind
of wanted to fit in . . . " represented a pattern of activity that
exemplifies the need for context when attempting to interpret
pain-related behavior. Specifically, embarrassment, fear of
disapproval, or social exclusion was a motivating factor for
activity in specific instances.
Physical impairments can result in " . . . an individual's
identity as a complete person [being called] into question"
(Luborsky, 1994, p. 239). When researching the context of
activity level changes among older adults, Mackichan et al.
(2013) discovered facets of pain-related behavior that could
not be explained by the existing fear avoidance model. The
fear of losing autonomy and independence influenced the
activity level of older adults with chronic pain, often causing
them to limit activity and social connectivity in what has
been described as "paradoxically result[ing] from a desire to
preserve function" (Mackichan et al., 2013, p. 7). Also, the
use of assistive or adaptive mobility devices to help them
remain active may be an affront to their dignity and a cause
for embarrassment (Morgan, 2006). In fact, participants with
chronic pain reported avoidance of meaningful activity once
it became clear that they needed an adaptive device to con-
tinue with the activity (Davis et al., 2002). The self-discrep-
ancies between ideal and actual abilities described by
Huijnen et al. (2011) fall in line with this notion. For exam-
ple, OA pain may have interfered with participants' deeply
held notions of their ideal selves, threatening to alter the
identities they would like to continue promoting or the face
they would like to continue presenting to the world (Fenwick
et al., 2012; Luborsky, 1994).
The pattern of avoiding pain and risking embarrassment
was exemplified by our two hiking enthusiasts, who each
reported feeling socially uncomfortable because of the limit-
ing effects of OA knee pain and the compromises they had to
make in terms of activity level. One of them discovered too
late that her knee was not up to hiking and chose to risk
embarrassment or disapproval from their peers by limiting
activity. The second participant avoided pain by slowing
down, and as a result, could not keep up with companion hik-
ers. She continued on with the hike but did not feel comfort-
able pushing herself to keep pace with her family. Both
hikers in these examples appeared to be in the process of
readjusting life course expectations but experienced frustra-
tion over the need to do so, in contrast to a study by Davis et
al. (2002) who reported older adults expected pain and
increased mobility challenges as a normal part of aging.
These examples also illustrated the value of activities, such
as hiking, that transcended the physical health-related advan-
tages associated with them. In addition, they demonstrate the
distress caused by the threat of losing these abilities (Keysor
et al., 1998). Hiking was meaningful and beneficial for these
participants and echoed other studies where restrictions on
favored physical activities " . . . were a source of distress and
signaled a loss to their identity" (Kaptein et al., 2013, p.
1074). The woman who had to cut back on holding grand-
children for fear her knees would give out expressed a sense
of dissatisfaction in the lifestyle compromises OA pain
required her to make. It is possible that her compromises
regarding meaningful activities, such as holding grandchil-
dren, indicate discrepancies between the culturally and gen-
erationally engrained life course expectations and the current
reality regarding her abilities (Becker, 1994). Her decisions
on how to manage these compromises and uncertainties
reflect the notion of "biographical embeddedness of health
and illness" (Zinn, 2005, p. 2).
The man who had to modify his sport-related activity, par-
ticularly basketball, indicated that making these adjustments
to his game was about more than just avoiding getting injured
or "overdoing it" on the basketball court. He was frustrated
by the things he could once do so easily, much like the par-
ticipants in existing studies on physical activity, identity, and
arthritis (Kaptein et al., 2013). His modified persistence may
have been an attempt to minimize the discrepancy between
Kabel et al. 5
his actual and ideal abilities, as well as maintain engagement
within his social group, allowing him to feel more connected
to the "ideal" version of himself. These results resembled
Huijnen and colleagues' (2011) work on self-discrepancy
and activity-related behavior. The authors reported that peo-
ple with chronic pain who feel closer to the "ideal" versions
of themselves are more likely to exhibit an activity pattern of
persistence.
It is noteworthy that we found no example of a participant
discussing risking pain and avoiding embarrassment by
avoiding activity. On the surface, it would seem reasonable
that one could not risk pain by avoiding physical activity.
However, a paradox of inactivity exists (Mackichan et al.,
2013) in that some people with knee OA report knowing that
remaining active is important for pain control. Therefore,
some people with OA are knowingly risking pain by avoid-
ing physical activity. These examples shed light on need for
a holistic approach to the context and complexity required
when managing chronic conditions (Morden, Jinks, & Ong,
2012). This is especially relevant when considering pain-
related avoidance and persistence behavior to expand our
current understanding of how embarrassment can influence
physical activity in people living with OA.
The small sample size and the fact that participant narra-
tives were not accompanied by observations of physical
activity outside of the research setting are limitations to these
findings. Further research is required to determine whether
or not multiple patterns of activity engagement and avoid-
ance co-exist within one individual, as has been indicated in
other studies (Kindermans et al., 2011; Mackichan et al.,
2013; McCracken & Samuel, 2007). Comprehensive knowl-
edge of these patterns of activity engagement, avoidance,
and self-management are necessary for more effective indi-
vidualized recommendations and clinical advice (Grime et
al., 2010). Knowledge of patient expectations for activity
throughout the life course (Moore et al., 2014) is necessary
to help patients identify when OA pain prevents them from
being the person they want to be.
