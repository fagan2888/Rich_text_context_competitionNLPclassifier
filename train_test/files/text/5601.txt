Introduction
The insertion and deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE: NM 000789.2)
gene is the first genetic variant associated with human
physical performance and is in strong linkage disequilib-
rium with genetic factors that influence serum ACE con-
centrations. The I allele has been associated with certain
aspects of endurance performance and functionally asso-
ciated with reduced ACE serum levels and activity.1,2 The
ACE gene, which consists of 26 exons, is 44,770 bp in
size and is located on chromosome 17q23.3. The I allele
of the ACE polymorphism (rs4646994) contains an Alu
repeat sequence that is absent from the D allele, resulting
in II, ID, and DD genotypes.3 The D allele has been shown
to be associated with higher levels of circulatory ACE
enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Despite being an
intronic variation, it accounts for approximately half of
the observed variance in plasma levels of the ACE pro-
tein.4 The role of ACE polymorphism has been investi-
gated as a risk factor for several diseases. Worldwide
estimates indicate that 9.6% of men and 18% of women of
60 years of age have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA).

Abstract
Introduction: Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) insertion and deletion (I/D) polymorphism has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). In recent years, numerous genetic factors have been identified and implicated
in OA. In this Asian Indian population-based study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between ACE (I28005D) gene
polymorphism and primary OA. We performed a case-control association study to identify and explore the correlation
between clinically, radiologically diagnosed individuals with primary knee OA and the ACE I/D polymorphism.
Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from 200 samples, including 100 OA cases and 100 healthy volunteers. DNA was
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using I and D allele-specific primers. PCR products were assessed via UV
visualization of products electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels.
Results: The groups differed significantly in genotype distributions (p < 0.05). The primary knee OA group showed a
considerably higher incidence of the DD genotype and the D allele compared to the control group (OR = 2.14, 95% CI:
1.10­4.15, p = 0.02 and OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.39­3.10, p = 0.0003).
Conclusion: The ACE gene polymorphism I28005D was found to be associated with primary knee OA in Asian Indian
populations. This is the first study in India to report that the ACE gene polymorphism is a risk factor for early onset
primary knee OA.

OA is a multifactorial disease and is the most common
form of arthritis with a clear genetic component, affecting
40% of individuals across age groups; it is also one of the
most common disabling diseases worldwide.5 It is charac-
terized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage in the
synovial joints and changes in the adjacent bone.6 OA is a
polygenic disease and its pathogenesis is influenced by
several environmental factors such as ageing, hormones,
mechanical factors, and lifestyle. Results of family-based
and candidate gene studies have demonstrated that a
genetic component is implicated in its pathophysiology.7
ACE is a candidate gene for the development of OA, and it
is known to play an important role in several inflammatory
and immune-related disorders. ACE polymorphisms have
been shown to be related to rheumatic and autoimmune
diseases in particular.8,9 Based on these prior studies, we
hypothesized that studies of ACE in OA patients could be
used for determining the risk factors involved in the patho-
genesis of this disease. To improve our understanding of
the importance ofACE in the pathology of OA, we directly
investigated the I28005D polymorphism of the ACE gene
in OA patients from an Asian Indian population.
Materials and methods
Ethics
Ethical approval (KHL No. e374/07) for this research
was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee,
Hyderabad, India.
Assortment of subjects
Our study included 100 cases aged 25­65 years from the
Department of Orthopedics, Kamineni Hospitals,
Hyderabad, India who were clinically and radiologically
diagnosed with primary knee OA based on the criteria that
they should have KL grade 0­4,10 and 100 age- and gen-
der-matched healthy controls with no history of OA or any
complications of metabolic disorders.
Collection of blood
Two milliliters of venous blood was collected in EDTA
vacutainers from each subject (n = 200). Personal and fam-
ily histories were taken simultaneously using a well-
designed proforma.
Genotyping of polymorphism
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples using a
salting-out technique. For DNA extraction, EDTA (300
µL) was added to the blood, and further dissolved in 50 µL
of tris-EDTA buffer.11 The quality of the isolated genomic
DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA, and USA). The oligonucleotide
sequences of the PCR primers for the I28005D alleles
were selected from our previous studies, which had been
performed in the same population.11,12 Genotyping for the
ACE (rs4646994; I28005D) gene was accomplished by
direct PCR, and successful amplification was confirmed
by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. PCR reactions
were performed in a thermal cycler, with initial denatura-
tion at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 amplification
cycles, each of which consisted of denaturation at 95°C for
30 s, 59°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at
72°C for 5 min. Detection of a large band (490 bp) indi-
cated that the allele contained the 287-bp Alu sequence;
detection of a 190-bp band indicated the short allele, which
does not contain the Alu sequence. Individuals with both
the large and the short fragments, i.e. 490/190 bp, were
identified as heterozygotes (Figure 1). Genotype frag-
ments were imaged using a gel documentation system
(Kamineni Life Sciences, Moula Ali, Hyderabad, India).
Statistical analysis
Associations between genotype and OA were examined
by odds ratio analysis, with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) and chi-square analysis, using the software OpenEpi.
The allele frequencies of the ACE gene were tested to
determine whether they were in Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE). Allelic frequencies were calculated accord-
ing to the number of different alleles observed and the

total number of alleles examined. Clinical data are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (M ± SD). Data
were also analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). An
independent sample t-test was used to test the cases and
controls. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the sub-
jects included in this case-control study, with (n = 100) and
without (n = 100) OA. The groups did not differ signifi-
cantly in gene or age composition (p = 0.88 and p = 0.87,
respectively); however, they did differ significantly in
weight (p = 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.01).
Twenty-eight percent of patients had a positive family
history.
Association study
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) I28005D, located
in the intron 16 region of the ACE gene, showed a signifi-
cant association with OA. In both the control and OA
groups, the ACE alleles were found to be in HWE. Table 2
shows the distribution of the ACE gene I28005D geno-
types in OA cases and controls. In controls, the genotype
distribution was 32% (I/I), 46% (I/D), and 22% (D/D),
whereas in OA patients, the distribution was 18% (I/I),
38% (I/D), and 44% (D/D). Significant variation was
observed in the distribution of the D allele (OR = 2.08,
95% CI: 1.39­3.10, p = 0.0003) and the DD genotype (OR
= 2.14, 95% CI: 1.10­4.15, p = 0.02) in the patient group
compared to the control subjects. The D allele was signifi-
cantly associated with the disease according to the domi-
nant (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.10­4.15, p = 0.02) and
recessive models of inheritance (OR = 2.78, 95% CI:
1.50­5.15, p = 0.001). BMI is one of the co-variants for
OA, and the obese population is more prone to the disease
(Figure 2(a)). Hence, the study group was categorized as
normal (18.5­24.9 BMI), overweight (25­29.9 BMI), or
obese (>30 BMI) based on BMI. The prevalence of the D
allele was higher in OA cases compared to controls, as
shown in Table 3 (Figure 2(b)).
Both overweight and obese individuals with the D allele
were more prone to OA. The controls did not show any
association between BMI and genotype (Figure 3(a) and
(b)). Neither allele nor genotype showed an association
between the ACE I28005D polymorphism and OA, as
shown in Table 4 (see also Figure 3(c)).
Other confounding factors, such as hypertension, type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and thyroid dysregulation were
also investigated, and it was found that hypertensive indi-
viduals are more prone to OA.
Discussion
Severe OA is a cause of social, economic, and personal
burden, and is the main cause of an increasing need for
knee joint replacement. Susceptibility to complex dis-
eases, such as OA, is often associated with genetic poly-
morphisms.AcomprehensivestudyofCUMAGAS-OSTEO

identified 66 variants, two of which, GDF5 (rs143383) and
LRCH1 (rs912428), were associated with OA.13 Recently
it has been shown that the renin­angiotensin system (RAS)
is directly involved in bone metabolism, and ACE inhibi-
tors have been shown to have beneficial effects, attributed
to a reduced level of angiotensin II and suppressed stimu-
lation of the angiotensin II signaling pathway.14 The RAS
is primarily involved in the regulation of blood pressure
and serum electrolytes. The biological mechanism of ACE
has been shown to involve a metalloenzyme that converts
angiotensin I to a potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II,
and inactivates bradykinin, which is a vasodilator of the
kallikrein­kinin system and has major implications in
inflammatory processes including OA.8 The RAS has been
shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several dis-
eases, including fibrosis in the heart, kidney, lung, and
liver during chronic inflammation, through regulation of
cell growth, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
assess the association of polymorphisms of the ACE gene
I28005D with OA in an Asian Indian population. In the
present study, primary knee OA was found to be signifi-
cantly associated with the DD genotypic and D allelic dis-
tributions compared to controls (2.78, 95% CI: 1.50­5.15,
p = 0.001 and 2.08, 95% CI: 1.39­3.10, p = 0.0003). Our
study shows that individuals with the D allele or the DD
genotype have a more than twofold increased risk of devel-
oping OA. Thus, the I28005D polymorphism was found to

be a biomarker for increased risk of OA and a risk allele
among Asian Indians.
Several earlier studies conducted in Asian Indian popu-
lations found an association between ACE polymorphisms
and certain diseases. We have previously reported an asso-
ciation of ACE polymorphism with T2DM with neuropa-
thy and gestational diabetes.11,12 Narne et al. showed that it
is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myo-
cardial infarction (MI),15 Ganesan et al. showed an asso-
ciation with CAD and T2DM,16 and Reddy et al. showed a
significant association between MI and the DD genotype
in our population.17
Because weight and BMI primarily affect the knee joint,
we categorized the OA cases into normal, overweight, and
1286 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
obese groups, based on BMI. It was observed that 68% of
OA cases were obese and 26% were overweight. Obese
individuals showed a 26-fold increased risk for develop-
ment of OA compared to controls with normal body weight
(26.44, 95% CI: 10.10­69.20, p < 0.0001), and overweight
individuals showed a 12-fold increased risk for developing
OA (12.13, 95% CI: 4.35­33.78, p < 0.0001). It is well
established that weight gain is a risk factor for knee OA;
however, a recent study byApold et al. using a large sample
size has indicated that the impact of weight gain is strongest
in the younger age group and that this association weakens
in the older age group.18 Because 53% of the age-matched
controls were also obese, it is evident that factors other than
weight are also important in primary OA.
We attempted to determine the combined association of
BMI and ACE ID polymorphism in OA. Our data indi-
cated that the D allele potentiates the effect of BMI in both
overweight and obese patients. We observed that >80% of
overweight and obese patients possessed the D allele,
whereas all patients with a normal BMI possessed the del-
eterious allele. An ANOVA showed a significant associa-
tion (p < 0.0001) between BMI and genotype.
Our results are consistent with results reported by
Hong et al.,9 Inanir et al.,8 and Bayram et al.,19 who
showed that the DD genotype and the D allele are risk
factors for OA in Korean and Turkish populations.
However, a study on the same Turkish population by
Bayram et al. did not find a significant association
between OA and ACE polymorphism in patients with
synovial fluid.20 A study by Shehab et al. also failed to
show an association between the ACE gene and OA in a
Kuwaiti population.21 Our present study was limited by
our small sample size, and we were not able to measure
the ACE levels; however, this study reports a significant
association between polymorphism of the ACE gene
I28005D and OA. In conclusion, angiotensin I converting
enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism is associated with
primary knee OA in Asian Indian populations.
