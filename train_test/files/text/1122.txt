Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms
in a Population-Based Sample of Young Adults

Context: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
has been associated with increased risk of smoking, and
some studies have suggested that inattentive symptoms
specifically may underlie this risk. Few studies, how-
ever, have examined ADHD symptoms in nonclinical
samples to determine the extent to which the number of
symptoms--independentofthefulldiagnosis--conferrisk
for smoking-related outcomes.
Objective: To evaluate the relation between smoking-
related variables and the number of retrospectively re-
ported ADHD inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive
symptoms in a population-based sample of young adults.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The study popu-
lation consists of 15 197 eligible participants from wave
III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, a nationally representative sample of adoles-
cents followed from 1995 to 2002.
Main Outcome Measures: Logistic regression was used
to examine the relation between self-reported ADHD
symptoms and the lifetime likelihood of being a regular
smoker, defined by having smoked at least 1 cigarette a
day for 30 days. For individuals reporting regular smok-
ing, we also examined the extent to which ADHD symp-
toms predicted age at onset of regular smoking and num-
ber of cigarettes smoked.
Results: A linear relation was identified between the
number of self-reported inattentive and hyperactive/
impulsive symptoms and smoking outcome measures
(P.001 for each symptom domain). Controlling for
demographic and conduct disorder symptoms, each re-
ported inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symp-
tom significantly increased the likelihood of ever regu-
lar smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.08-1.14 and OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-
1.19, respectively). For those reporting lifetime regular
smoking, reported symptoms decreased the estimated age
at onset and increased the number of cigarettes smoked.
Conclusions: Self-reported ADHD symptoms were found
to be associated with adult smoking outcome variables
in this nationally representative sample, providing fur-
ther evidence of a likely link between ADHD symptoms
and risk for tobacco use.

CLINICAL SAMPLES OF INDI-
viduals with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) smoke at
rates significantly higher
than the general population and/or non-
diagnosed controls among both adults
(41%-42% vs 26% for ADHD and non-
ADHD, respectively)1,2 and adolescents
(19%-46% vs 10%-24% for ADHD and
non-ADHD, respectively).2-6 Moreover,
these studies have shown that individu-
als with ADHD report earlier initiation of
smoking than their nondiagnosed peers
and are more likely to progress from ini-
tiation to regular smoking.4-6 Adult smok-
ers with ADHD also report more diffi-
culty quitting than individuals in the
general population.1
A number of studies have reported that
theco-occurrenceofADHDandsubstance
use disorders in general can be accounted
foralmostcompletelybythepresenceofco-
morbidconductdisorder(CD).7-9 Attention-
deficit/hyperactivitydisorder,however,has
been shown to be an independent risk fac-
torfortobaccousespecificallyinclinicaland
high-risksamples,evenaftercontrollingfor
comorbid CD.3,5 Moreover, there is some
evidence that specific problems with inat-
tention and related deficits in executive
functioning significantly predict smoking,
even after controlling for conduct prob-
lems.5,10,11 Further, the risk for smoking has
been shown to be more strongly associ-
ated with the number of reported inatten-
tive (IN) symptoms than by the diagnosis
of ADHD itself.11

The relationship between smoking and inattention is
also supported by studies using non-ADHD samples. In
a group of smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation pro-
gram, ADHD-IN symptoms were significantly associ-
ated with smoking motivation factors including smok-
ing for stimulation.12 Data from a large community sample
of adolescents also showed that problems with atten-
tion differentially predicted smoking status.13
To date, studies examining the relationship between
ADHD symptoms and smoking have focused primarily
on clinical or high-risk samples. Data from several larger
community samples as well as laboratory studies in hu-
mans and nonhumans have also suggested that nicotine
self-administration (ie, smoking) may be related to its
augmenting effects on attention and executive function-
ing.14,15 Given the demonstrated association between in-
attention and smoking across diverse samples and in-
laboratory experiments, the objective of the present study
was to examine the link between self-reported ADHD
symptoms and smoking status in a large population-
based sample of young adults while controlling for the
confounding effects of CD symptoms, sex, indicators of
socioeconomic status (parental education and receipt of
public assistance), and ethnicity. We examined data from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) to accomplish this goal.16,17
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
The study population was drawn from 20 747 adolescents from
Add Health, a nationally representative study of adolescents.
The longitudinal cohort includes 15 197 eligible respondents
who participated in in-home surveys on 3 separate occasions
(April to December, 1995; April to August, 1996; and August
2001 to August 2002). The mean (SD) age of survey partici-
pants on the 3 waves of data collection was 15.65 (1.75) years,
16.22 (1.64) years, and 22.96 (1.77) years. By design, the
Add Health survey included a sample stratified by region, ur-
banicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size to garner a nation-
ally representative sample. Precise details regarding the de-
sign and data collection have been described elsewhere.16,17
SAMPLE
For the present study, poststratification weights were unavail-
able for 875 participants and the subpopulation of women who
were pregnant (n=379) were further excluded because it was
believed that women who were pregnant may alter their smok-
ing behaviors. Information regarding CD symptoms and ADHD
symptoms was collected during waves I and III, respectively.
The final analysis sample included 13 852 adolescents (49.5%
male, 50.5% female; 62.9% white, 37.1% nonwhite) with com-
plete data on items assessing ADHD and tobacco use.
MEASURES
Participants were separated into 2 groups based on their self-
reported smoking status during wave III. Those reporting hav-
ing ever smoked at least 1 cigarette every day for 30 days were
classified as "ever-regular smokers" (n=5344, 38.6%). All other
individuals were classified as "never-regular smokers" (n=8506,
61.4%). The never-regular smoker group was composed of in-
dividuals who had never tried smoking, had only taken 1 or 2
puffs, who had taken puffs but never smoked an entire ciga-
rette, or who had smoked an entire cigarette but never smoked
regularly. We chose this classification since the primary aim
of the study was to determine whether ADHD symptoms in-
creased the lifetime risk for regular smoking, regardless of cur-
rent smoking status. Smoking behavior has been assessed in a
similar manner in other epidemiological studies and has been
shown to have acceptable reliability and validity among chil-
dren and adolescents.13,18-20
To further assess the relation between ADHD symptoms
and smoking behaviors, 2 additional variables were exam-
ined: (1) self-reported age at onset of regular smoking (5-26
years); and for current regular smokers, (2) the number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day in the last 30 days (1-100 cigarettes).
In wave III, participants were asked to retrospectively re-
port ADHD symptoms experienced between the ages of 5 and
12 years. Respondents were asked to report the frequency of a
symptom using a 4-point Likert scale: never or rarely, some-
times, often, very often. One item asked in the retrospective
ADHD section of wave III ("You were spiteful or vindictive")
is not a DSM-IV ADHD symptom and was excluded from analy-
ses; while 1 DSM-IV impulsivity symptom ("Often interrupts
or intrudes on others") was not included in the retrospective
ADHD section. Thus, our analyses included responses to 9 IN
and 8 hyperactive/impulsive (HI) symptoms.
A symptom was considered present if it was experienced "of-
ten" or "very often." This approach to dichotomizing symptoms
has been used in other community-based studies of ADHD symp-
tomatology and is considered clinical convention.21 For our pri-
mary analyses, the total number of symptoms reported (0-9 for
IN; 0-8 for HI) was used as a measure of ADHD severity to assess
therelationbetweensymptomsandbothsmokingstatusandother
smoking outcomes (eg, age at onset of regular smoking, number
of cigarettes smoked per day). For descriptive and bivariate analy-
ses, individuals were classified into 1 of 4 groups based on the
numberofreportedsymptoms:(1)6ormoreINsymptoms,fewer
than 6 HI symptoms; (2) 6 or more HI symptoms, fewer than 6
INsymptoms;(3)6ormoreINsymptomsand6ormoreHIsymp-
toms; and (4) fewer than 6 HI and fewer than 6 IN symptoms.
The 6-symptom cutoff was chosen to be consistent with DSM-IV
ADHDcriteriarequiringthepresenceof6ormoresymptomsfrom
either the IN or HI symptom domains.
Internal consistency of the ADHD items specifically from
the Add Health data set was found to be adequate (Cronbach
=.86). Moreover, parents of individuals reporting 6 or more
symptoms on either or both IN and HI scales were more likely
to indicate learning or other behavioral problems at wave I; and
these individuals were also more likely to report taking medi-
cation for ADHD at wave III (2=7.96-99.83; P=.005-.001).
Since CD has been shown in previous studies to be an im-
portant mediator of the risk between ADHD and substance use,22
we included a measure of CD symptoms in multivariate analy-
ses. This variable consisted of responses to 13 questions that
corresponded to DSM-IV symptom criteria for CD that have been
used in previous studies with the Add Health database to char-
acterize CD23 and was shown in our analysis to have adequate
internal consistency (Cronbach =.67).
Factors related to socioeconomic status have also been shown
to be associated with the development of smoking24 and thus,
we controlled for parental report of the highest education level
of either themselves or their spouse and whether the family of
the participant was receiving public assistance at wave I.

for control of survey design effects of individuals clustered in
sampling units of school and stratification of geographic re-
gion. Poststratification weights were applied to allow the re-
sults to be comparable to young adults in the United States popu-
lation. Initial bivariate analyses were conducted to examine the
relationship between risk factors and smoking status. This was
followed by a multiple logistic regression analysis in which the
relationship between ADHD and smoking was examined with
other risk factors in the model.
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
The weighted percentages of respondents reporting 6 or
more IN symptoms (2.71%), 6 or more HI symptoms
(2.95%), or 6 or more of both IN and HI symptoms
(2.51%) are consistent with other known prevalence es-
timates for ADHD in the general population and in pre-
viousstudiesofADHDsymptomsandsmoking.13,26,27 Simi-
larly, the reported rates of lifetime regular smoking
(42.57%)1 are consistent with prevalence data from other
sources.28 Mean (SE) age of the respondents at wave III
of data collection was 21.94 (0.02). Mean (SE) number
of CD symptoms reported from wave I was 0.90 (0.01).
With regard to factors related to socioeconomic status,
11.3% parents had less than a high school degree,
26.7% had completed high school or an equivalent de-
gree, 30.5% had completed an associates degree or some
college, 31.6% had completed college or higher, and 8.9%
of families were recipients of public assistance at wave I.
BIVARIATE ANALYSES
Reporting higher numbers of CD symptoms, being Cau-
casian, and reporting 6 or more IN and/or HI symptoms
were all significantly associated with higher likelihood
of ever regular smoking (Table 1). Since one of the pri-
mary aims of the present study was to examine the in-
cremental contribution of ADHD symptoms, even at lev-
els below traditional clinical thresholds, we analyzed the
rates of ever regular smoking as a function of total num-
ber of retrospectively reported symptoms. There was a
strong relationship between the number of symptoms and
smoking status for both IN and HI symptom domains
(Figure 1).
The odds ratios (ORs) for self-reported ADHD symp-
toms as predictors of ever regular smoking were signifi-
cant (Table 2). Overall, each additional symptom re-
ported increased the odds of being an ever regular smoker
by 14% and 20% for IN and HI symptoms, respectively.

A test of trend for each symptom indicated a significant
linear trend (P.001 for both HI and IN). A test for a
quadratic trend was also examined and found not to be
significant (P=.12 for hyperactivity and P=.07 for inat-
tention). Thus, the changes in individual ORs for each
additional reported symptom were generally positive and
linear for both symptom domains.
MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Relations between the number of self-reported ADHD
symptoms and ever regular smoking after controlling
for other potentially important predictor variables were
examined using multiple logistic regression. The addi-
tion of demographic variables (Table 3) (age, race,
sex, and parental education, receipt of public assistance
[model 2]) and CD symptoms (model 3) resulted in de-
creased ORs for both HI (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.19)
and IN symptoms (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.14),
though both remained significant. In model 4, both
symptom domains were included, which again de-
creased the OR for both domains although to a substan-
tially larger extent for IN (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98-1.06)
compared with HI (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.19). Con-
sistent with these ORs, comparisons of log likelihood
ratios indicated greater improvement in fit by adding HI
to a model already including IN (2 [1]=99.30,
P.001) than by adding IN to a model already includ-
ing HI (2 [1]=2.14, P=.17).
To assess ORs for more clinically relevant variables, the
samemodelsmentionedearlierwerecalculatedusingsymp-
tom cutoff variables as predictors. After accounting for all
other variables (including the other symptom category),
the odds of becoming a lifetime regular smoker were 1.23
and 2.13 times greater than for those individuals with 6
or more IN and HI symptoms, respectively. Individuals re-
porting 6 or more IN and 6 or more HI symptoms were
2.28 times more likely to become regular smokers.
IMPACT OF SELF-REPORTED ADHD SYMPTOMS
ON OTHER SMOKING OUTCOMES
To further explore the association between retrospec-
tively reported ADHD symptoms and smoking status, we
conducted 2 additional analyses of regular smokers. In-
attention and HI symptoms were both significantly as-
sociated with age at onset of regular smoking (=-0.12,
SE=0.02, P.001; and =-0.11, SE=0.02, P.001, re-
spectively). Among lifetime regular smokers, the esti-
mated age at onset of regular smoking was 16.67 and 16.73
years in individuals reporting zero IN and HI symp-
toms, respectively (Figure 2). By contrast, individuals
reporting the highest number of symptoms for the IN and
HI symptom domains began smoking at ages 15.44 and
15.48 years, respectively.
Further, among current regular smokers, the number
of self-reported IN and HI ADHD symptoms were posi-
tively associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per
day in the past 30 days, (=0.64, SE=0.11, P.001; and
=0.63,SE=0.11,P.001,respectively)(Figure 3).Regu-
lar smokers with 0 IN and HI symptoms smoked an esti-
mated 10.71 and 10.62 cigarettes per day while smokers

13.18 and 13.97 cigarettes per day, respectively.

COMMENT
In the present analyses, we observed significant rela-
tions between the number of reported retrospective ADHD
symptoms and lifetime regular cigarette smoking in a
sample of young adults, controlling for demographic vari-
ables and CD symptoms. These relations among ADHD
symptoms and smoking behavior were largely linear with
each additional symptom typically conferring addi-
tional risk of regular smoking. Hyperactivity/impul-
sivity symptoms were found to be a better predictor of
lifetime regular smoking than IN symptoms. Among regu-
lar smokers, more ADHD symptoms were also associ-
ated with earlier regular smoking and with greater ciga-
rette consumption--again in a largely linear manner. The
present findings are consistent with previous reports link-
ing ADHD symptoms to smoking.5,10,11,13 However, con-
trary to previous studies which have reported a stronger
link between IN symptoms and smoking, our data sug-
gest that HI symptoms confer greater risk for ever regu-
lar smoking. Several methodological features of our study
may account for this difference. First, the average age of
respondents in the present sample (21.94 years) was con-
siderably higher than other studies (eg, 10th grade high
school students13). Since the present sample was older,
the opportunity to initiate and maintain smoking behav-
iors would necessarily be higher in this group. More-
over, the relation among ADHD symptoms and smok-
ing might change over time. Future studies will be needed
to examine this hypothesis.
Second, the primary smoking outcome measure in the
current study was based on a history of lifetime regular
use defined as smoking at least 1 cigarette per day for 30
days. In other studies, the primary smoking outcome vari-
ables were generally defined on the basis of much more
infrequent use (eg, ever tried at least 1 puff of a ciga-
rette13). As such, the use of a more stringent smoking out-
come measure may have resulted in differential associa-
tions with HI and IN symptoms. The current study has
several important strengths. First, the results reported here
are based on a large epidemiological sample and were ana-
lyzed using population-based statistical approaches. As
such, these findings extend those from community and
clinical samples and are highly generalizable. A second
strength is that the incremental influence of individual
ADHD symptoms was examined while also controlling for
the effects of other variables known to be associated with
smoking (eg, socioeconomic status, CD symptoms). The
results, therefore, allow for a more accurate view of the
association among these important variables.
One limitation of the present study was the use of ret-
rospectively reported ADHD symptoms as a primary in-
dependent variable. The nature of the Add Health sur-
vey was such that individuals were asked to report on
symptoms occurring approximately 10 years before the
time of report. The use of retrospective report is com-
mon in clinical practice when working with adults with
ADHD and data exist that support the reliability and va-
lidity of these self-reports29-32 (also J. N. Epstein, PhD,
and S.H.K., unpublished data, 2005). We also demon-
strated adequate reliability and validity of this approach
in the present sample. A second limitation of this study
was that none of the models tested controlled for comor-
bid non-nicotine substance use disorders, which are also
highly related to smoking. As such, it is possible that the
relationship between ADHD symptoms and smoking
could be confounded by concurrent substance use. Given
the prevalence rates reported for smoking in our study
however, this possibility seems unlikely.
The results of this investigation suggest that the num-
ber of HI symptoms are strongly associated with the like-
lihood of regular smoking, even in individuals report-
ing subclinical ADHD symptom levels. By contrast, IN
symptoms are not significantly associated with lifetime
regular smoking when all variables including HI symp-
toms are controlled. Thus, the findings extend existing
research suggesting a possible link between ADHD symp-
toms and smoking risk. Further work is necessary, how-
ever, to more precisely characterize the nature of the re-
lationship between ADHD symptoms and smoking. For
example, it will be important in future studies to deter-
mine whether specific ADHD symptoms or symptom clus-
ters are more strongly associated with smoking risk.
These findings also suggest that self-reported ADHD
symptoms are associated with age at onset of regular smok-
ing. Given the established link among earlier age at on-
set of smoking and risk for subsequent nicotine depen-
dence and other drug use problems,33-35 these data are of
high clinical and public health significance. The nature
of the present study does not allow for any conclusions
to be drawn regarding potential mechanisms that might
account for the relation between ADHD symptoms and
smoking. However, regulation of dopamine and seroto-
nin have been linked with both smoking onset and de-
pendence as well as with ADHD symptomatalogy.36,37 Sub-
sequent experimental research will be needed to further
examine the relationship between smoking and ADHD
symptoms and possible underlying mechanisms. How-
ever, the robustness of the reported association empha-
sizes the need for subsequent experimental research to
examine these relations.
