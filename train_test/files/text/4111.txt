Abstract
Objectives: To determine the typical corneal changes in pure microphthalmia using a corneal
topography system and identify characteristics that may assist in early diagnosis.
Methods: Patients with pure microphthalmia and healthy control subjects underwent corneal
topography analysis (Orbscan IIZÕ Corneal Topography System; Bausch and Lomb, Bridgewater,
NJ, USA) to determine degree of corneal astigmatism (mean A), simulation of corneal astigmatism
(sim A), mean keratometry (mean K), simulated keratometry (sim K), irregularities in the 3 - and 5-
mm zone, and mean thickness of nine distinct corneal regions.
Results: Patients with pure microphthalmia (n ¼ 12) had significantly higher mean K, sim K, mean
A, sim A, 3.0 mm irregularity and 5.0 mm irregularity, and exhibited significantly more false
keratoconus than controls (n ¼ 12). There was a significant between-group difference in the
morphology of the anterior corneal surface and the central curvature of the cornea.
Conclusions: Changes in corneal morphology observed in this study could be useful in borderline
situations to confirm the diagnosis of pure microphthalmia.

Introduction
Pure microphthalmia is a rare congenital
abnormality in which the volume of the
eyeball is much smaller than normal but
there are no other significant eye malforma-
tions or systemic abnormalities. It is usually
bilateral, and is caused by termination of
eyeball development after closure of the
embryonic fissure. The condition is occa-
sionally sporadic, and can be either auto-
somal dominant or recessive. The main
clinical manifestations are microcornea,1
shortened axial length,2 narrow palpebral
fissure3 and thickened scleral wall,4,5 with
complications including glaucoma, uveal
effusion, exudative detachment of the
retina and intraocular haemorrhage being
common.
The majority of research into pure micro-
phthalmia has concentrated on the retina,
with the result that pathological changes to
the cornea are not well understood. The
aims of the present study were to determine
the typical corneal changes of pure micro-
phthalmia using a corneal topography
system, and identify characteristics that
may assist in early diagnosis.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective case­control study
recruited patients with pure microphthalmia
who attended the Department of
Ophthalmology, First Affiliated Hospital
of Nanchang University, Nanchang,
Jiangxi Province, China or Department of
Ophthalmology, Third Affiliated Hospital
of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi
Province, China, between October 2011 and
June 2014. Exclusion criteria were: factors
influencing refractive errors (including ker-
atoconus, corneal laser surgery, trauma,
etc); history of contact lens use; familial
keratoconus; chronic keratitis and conjunc-
tivitis; atopic disease; other systemic disease.
Patients with secondary glaucoma were
required to maintain normal intraocular
pressure, a transparent cornea (determined
via corneal endothelial mirror), a normal
ratio of hexagonal cells to corneal endothe-
lial cells and normal cell densities.
The control group comprised healthy age
and sex-matched volunteers recruited from
individuals undergoing routine health
screening at the First Affiliated Hospital of
Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi
Province, China with uncorrected visual
acuity score > 1.0, no history of trauma, no
contact lens use, no refractive surgery, and
normal eye development.
The study was approved by the ethics
committees of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi
Province and the Third Hospital of
Nanchang City, Nanchang, Jiangxi
Province, China, and was performed in
accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki for research involving human sub-
jects. All participants provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Diagnosis
All participants gave a detailed disease
history and underwent slit-lamp examin-
ation, inspection shadow optometry, auto-
matic refraction meter examination and
corneal topography. Ocular axial length
was measured with A-mode ultrasonic diag-
nostic equipment, with the mean of five
repeated measurements used for analysis.
Corneal topography
All participants underwent corneal topog-
raphy analysis using the Orbscan IIZÕ
Corneal Topography System (Bausch and
Lomb, Bridgewater, NJ, USA). With the
participant seated, the lower jaw was lifted
and the head restrained with the eyes
looking at the front lamp. The eyes were
kept open with light focusing at the centre of
Hu et al. 835
the pupil for 2 s, and corneal images were
exported to a computer system. Images
included a colour-code chart, anterior and
posterior corneal surface elevation maps,
a corneal surface gravity map and refractive
corneal thickness figures. A total of nine
corneal regions were identified, analysed
and read.
Study parameters included central thin-
nest corneal depth, degree of corneal astig-
matism (mean A), simulation of corneal
astigmatism (sim A), mean keratometry
(mean K), simulated keratometry (sim K),
irregularities in the 3 - and 5-mm zones, and
the mean thickness of nine distinct corneal
regions (2 mm diameter circles, 3 mm from
the optical axis; one at the central cornea
and eight in the periphery). Corneal topog-
raphy was classified based on anterior cor-
neal surface refraction (round, oval,
symmetrical bowknot, asymmetric bowknot
and irregular), corneal surface elevation
maps (symmetrical crest, asymmetric ridge,
incomplete crest, island, and unclassified)
and corneal thickness maps (circular, oval,
eccentric circular and eccentric oval).
Each eye was examined three times and
the best corneal topography images were
analysed. When the image of the central
cornea was unclear due to dry eye, eye
movement, poor eye fixation or blinking,
the examination was repeated until a distinct
image was obtained. Binocular images were
used for statistical analyses.
Statistical analyses
The sample size for the study was set to 12
based on the equation n ¼ 15.6R þ 1.6 with
80% confidence. Data were presented as
mean Æ SD (range). Between-group differ-
ences in sex were analysed using contingency
tables. Data regarding age, axial length,
dioptre, corneal refractive power and cor-
neal topography parameters were compared
using one-way analysis of variance or
Student's t-test. Function and sensitivity
indices were determined using discriminant
analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-
values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study recruited 12 patients with pure
microphthalmia (4 male/8 female; mean age
22.0 Æ 2.3 years; age range 6­44 years) and
12 control subjects (5 male/7 female; mean
age 21.6 Æ 2.8; age range 6­44 years). There
were no statistically significant between-
group differences in age or sex.
Data regarding optical characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Patients with pure micro-
phthalmia had significantly shorter axial
length and corneal diameter, and signifi-
cantly higher refractive power than control
subjects (P < 0.05 for each comparison;
Table 1).
Corneal topography data are shown in
Table 2. Patients with pure microphthalmia
had significantly higher mean K, sim K,
mean A, sim A, 3.0 mm irregularity and
5.0 mm irregularity than control subjects
(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 2). In
addition, significantly more eyes in the
patient group exhibited false keratoconus
compared with eyes in the control group
(P < 0.05; Table 2). There was a significant
between-group difference in the morphology
of the anterior corneal surface (P < 0.05;
Table 2). The central curvature of the cornea
was significantly greater in patients than
controls (P < 0.05; Table 2).
Data regarding corneal thickness are
given in Table 3. In the patient group, the
cornea was significantly thinner at the cen-
tral region and significantly thicker at all
other locations compared with the control
group (P < 0.05; Table 3).

Discussion
Pure microphthalmia is a rare congenital eye
disease characterised by small eye volume
(60% of normal sagittal diameter, vertical
diameter 14­17 mm, axial length < 20 mm,
corneal diameter < 10 mm). The prognosis is
poor, and patients are prone to secondary
glaucoma, uveal effusion and other fundus
diseases. Pathological examination of the
eye reveals abnormalities in the arrangement
of scleral collagen fibres together with
glycosaminoglycan deposition,6 leading to
the formation of a thickened and imperme-
able sclera.7 This results in obstructed vortex
venous backflow and subsequent chronic
choroidal effusion, ciliary body,choroidal
detachment and nonporous retinal detach-
ment.8 The size of the anterior segment of
the eye in is normal patients with pure
microphthalmia, but the volume ratio of
the crystalline lens is significantly increased.3
In addition, choroidal detachment can push
the lens iris diaphragm forwards so that it
bulges and impinges on the anterior cham-
ber, leading to secondary angle closure
glaucoma.9 Shortening of the posterior seg-
ment can lead to subtle retinal folds, chor-
oidal folds, uveal effusion syndrome and
pigmentary retinopathy.10 Diagnosis of pure
microphthalmia depends largely on clinical
presentation and associated ocular imaging,
including type A or B ultrasonography and
ultrasound biomicroscopy.
Patients with pure microphthalmia exhib-
ited a shortened eye axis, smaller corneal
diameter and high central corneal curvature,
as well as significantly higher mean K, sim
K, mean A and sim A compared with
control subjects in the present study. In
addition, 75% of eyes from patients pure
microphthalmia exhibited false keratoco-
nus. Changes in corneal shape and thickness
may prove useful for a greater understand-
ing of pure microphthalmia.
The shape of the central cornea is import-
ant for understanding its refractive index.
Thickness measurements at nine corneal
locations determined that 75% of eyes in
our patient group were in a state of false
keratoconus. In patients, the central and
temporal corneal areas were the thinnest,
while the thickest areas were in the nasal and
superior regions. This may be due to
glycosaminoglycan depositions in the scleral
and corneal fibres resulting in abnormal
collagen or elastic fibres, or damage and
thickening of the sclera and cornea. Since
central corneal thickness may affect intrao-
cular pressure,11 its measurement could
help with correct diagnosis of early glau-
coma in patients with progressive pure
microphthalmia.
The present study has several limitations,
including its small sample size and bias
associated with the single-centre design.
In conclusion, we describe changes in
corneal morphology that could be useful in
borderline situations to confirm the diagno-
sis of pure microphthalmia.
