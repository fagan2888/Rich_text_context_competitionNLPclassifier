phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency and the role
of the AÀ variant in a
Saudi population
Khalid Khalaf Alharbi and Imran Ali Khan
Abstract
Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency among Saudi men, and to establish the frequency of the two mutations/polymorphisms
associated with the G6PD AÀ mutation ­ G to A at nucleotide 202 (G202A) and A to G at
nucleotide 376 (A376G) ­ in those found to have G6PD deficiency.
Methods: Blood samples were obtained from healthy male Saudi donors and screened for G6PD
deficiency using a Fuorescent spot test. Samples from subjects shown to be G6PD deficient and
controls were then analysed for the presence of the G202A and A376G mutations on exons 4 and
5, respectively, of the G6PD gene using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment
length polymorphism.
Result: A total of 2100 male subjects were screened; of these, 100 (4.76%) were shown to be
G6PD deficient. The G6PD AÀ mutation (presence of both G202A and A376G) was observed in
two (2%) of the 100 subjects with G6PD deficiency. There was no significant difference in the
frequency of this mutation between those with G6PD deficiency and controls.
Conclusion: The G6PD AÀ mutation (G202A and A376G) does not appear to have a role in
G6PD deficiency in a Saudi population.

phosphate and reduced glutathione. G6PD
deficiency is caused by mutations in the X-
linked gene, G6PD. Over 400 mutations have
been reported, most of which are single amino
acid substitutions.1 The resulting protein
variants have different levels of enzyme activ-
ity and are associated with a variety of
biochemical and clinical phenotypes, resulting
from an increased vulnerability of erythro-
cytes to oxidative damage. Clinically these
may present as acute haemolytic anaemia,
chronic haemolytic anaemia or neonatal
hyperbilirubinaemia; alternatively, patients
may be asymptomatic.2 The most common
clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice
and acute haemolytic anaemia, both of which
are usually triggered by an exogenous agent.1
Most G6PD mutations occur sporadic-
ally, although the two most common forms,
G6PD Mediterranean and G6PD AÀ, occur
with increased frequency in certain popula-
tions.3 The polymorphic G6PD variants in
each population have a characteristic pro-
file.4 For example, in African populations
the G6PD AÀ variant (G to A at nucleotide
202 and A to G at nucleotide 376) is almost
exclusively the cause of G6PD deficiency,
whereas the G6PD Mediterranean variant
(C to T at nucleotide 563) is the predomin-
ant form in the Mediterranean and Middle
East regions, and in areas of India.5 A
number of additional `silent' polymorph-
isms that do not affect the amino acid
sequence of G6PD have been detected
using DNA sequencing of the G6PD gene.6
Studying the haplotypes created by combin-
ations of these polymorphisms may be
useful in identifying the origin of various
mutations.
In the present study, the prevalence of
G6PD deficiency was investigated in Saudi
men. The frequency of the two polymorph-
isms associated with the G6PD AÀ mutation
­ G to A at nucleotide 202 (G202A; resulting
in an amino acid change from valine to
methionine at position 68) and A to G at
nucleotide 376 (A376G; resulting in an
amino acid change from asparagine to
aspartate at position 126) ­ was determined
in those found to have G6PD deficiency.
Subjects and methods
Study population
Blood samples were obtained from healthy
male Saudi donors from the Central
Blood Bank, Taif, Dallah Driving
School, and the blood bank of King
Abdulaziz Specialist Hospital, Taif,
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the period
between July 2011 and August 2012.
Methodology is described below.
All samples were tested at the
Department of Clinical Laboratory
Sciences, College of Applied Medical
Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh,
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Written
informed consent was obtained from each
study participant and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee,
Ministry of Health, Taif, Saudi Arabia.
Screening for G6PD deficiency
A 6-ml venous blood sample was collected
from each subject in an ethylenediaminete-
tra-acetic acid anticoagulated tube and pro-
cessed within 24 h of collection. From this,
4 ml was used to screen for G6PD deficiency
using a Fuorescent spot test (Boehringer
Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
G6PD deficiency was confirmed using a
G6PD determination and quantitative test.7
In subjects shown to be G6PD deficient
and in control samples (which were selected
randomly from subjects who had a negative
result on the fluorescent spot test, no family
history of G6PD deficiency and no history
of blood disease), the remaining 2 -ml blood
sample was analysed for the presence of the
G202A and A376G mutations in the G6PD
gene. All samples were stored at À80C until
analysis.

DNA extraction; detection of gene
mutations
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral
blood samples using a DNA extraction kit
(Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
Extracted DNA was then dissolved in TE
buffer at a concentration of $100 ng DNA/
ml buffer (pH 7.0­7.9) and stored at À80C
until further analysis.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fol-
lowed by restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (RFLP) was carried out, to screen
for the G202A mutation on exon 4 and the
A376G mutation on exon 5 of the G6PD
gene. PCR was performed using 110-ng
samples of DNA, 2ÂPCR Master Mix
reagents (Norgen Biotek) and specific pri-
mers as used by Al-Jaouni et al.8 (Table 1).
Primers were synthesized by BioServe
Biotechnologies, Hyderabad, India.
Thermal cycling (Applied Biosystems,
Burlington, Ontario, Canada) involved pre-
liminary denaturation at 95C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
95C for 30 s, annealing at 60C for 30 s and
elongation at 72C for 45 s, followed by a
final elongation step at 72C for 5 min for
the G202A mutation; and preliminary
denaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30 s,
annealing at 62C for 30 s and elongation at
72C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation
step at 72C for 5 min for the A376G
mutation.
For RFLP, 10 U of the restriction
enzymes NlaIII and FokI (New England
BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were incu-
bated with 15 ml of PCR products for
2 h. Digestion products were separated
using 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis,
stained with ethidium bromide, and
quantified using ultraviolet transillumin-
ation. PCR equipment was supplied
by Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA.

Statistical analyses
Subjects' clinical characteristics were
expressed as the mean Æ SD. Allele frequen-
cies of G202A and A376G were evaluated
and compared using the 2-test and odds
ratios. A P-value <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. The Yates' correc-
tion was applied to the genotype analyses
using OpenEpi software (www.opene-
pi.com). All other statistical analyses were
performed using IBM SPSSÕ software, ver-
sion 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
A total of 2100 male subjects were screened;
of these, 100 (4.76%) were shown to have
G6PD deficiency. Blood samples from these
subjects and 100 controls (selected randomly
from the 2000 remaining samples) were used
for molecular analysis for the presence of the
G202A and A376G mutations. The age
range was 17­50 years (mean Æ SD
43 Æ 10.05 years) for those with G6PD
deficiency and 16­52 years (mean Æ SD
32.07 Æ 9.89 years) for controls; this differ-
ence was not statistically significant.
Genotype distributions and allele fre-
quencies in those with G6PD deficiency
and controls are given in Table 2. For the
G202A mutation, there were no statistically
significant differences in the genotype distri-
bution and allele frequencies between those
with G6PD deficiency and controls. The GA
genotype was completely absent in both
groups. The overall frequency of the
G202A mutation was 2% among those
with G6PD deficiency; this mutation was
absent in the controls.
For the A376G mutation, there were no
statistically significant differences in geno-
type distribution between the groups, but
the frequency of the G allele was signifi-
cantly higher in those with G6PD deficiency
than in controls (P ¼ 0.04). The AG geno-
type was completely absent in both groups.
The overall frequency of the A376G muta-
tion was 6% among those with G6PD
deficiency and 2% in controls.

The frequency of the G6PD A­ mutation,
in which both G202A and A376G are pre-
sent, was 2% in those with G6PD deficiency
and 0% in controls; however, this difference
was not statistically significant.
Discussion
Deficiency of G6PD is one of the most
common genetic disorders and is the most
frequently occurring enzymopathic red
blood-cell disorder, affecting more than
400 million people worldwide.9 This dis-
order has been reported in populations from
nearly all geographical locations; however, it
occurs most frequently in areas where
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic.
Prevalence estimates are highest in Africa,
Asia, the Mediterranean region and the
Middle East.9 Saudi Arabia is a large coun-
try, with $16.5 million people living in an
area of 2 149 690 km, and research has
reported the frequency of G6PD deficiency
among Saudi populations in different
regions of the country.10
Alabdulaali et al.11 reported a frequency
of G6PD deficiency of 1.13% in blood
donors in the capital city Riyadh, and the
rate was found to be 1.91% in the rural city
of Al-Kharj.12 In studies in the major cities
Najran, Riyadh and Bisha,13 Al-Ula13,14 and
Makkah,15 G6PD deficiency ranged in fre-
quency from 3.5 to 6.7%. The frequencies in
Jaizan, Al Hafouf and Khaiber,13 and in Al-
Baha16 and Al Qunfoda17 have been
reported to be 11.6­18%. The highest per-
centages of G6PD deficiency were reported
by Al-Ali18 in Al-Qatif (45.9%) and Al-
Hassa (36.5%). In the present study of 2100
Saudi males, 4.76% were shown to have
G6PD deficiency, which is low compared
with some other regions.
Muzaffer10 estimated the prevalence of
G6PD deficiency in neonates in Yanbu, in
the western part of Saudi Arabia, to be
$2%. This is similar to the 2% prevalence
reported by Niazi et al.19 from a cord-blood
screening programme conducted in 1992 in
Saudi Arabia, but lower than prevalences
reported by al-Nuaim et al.20 in the Riyadh
area and by Nasserullah et al.21 in the Qatif
and Al Hasa area.
Most of the mutations found in the
coding region of the G6PD gene are single
base substitutions, leading to an amino acid
replacement.22 Gari et al.23 studied the
frequency of G6PD mutations on exons 6
and 7 in Jeddah, in the west of Saudi Arabia,
and reported the presence of two mutations
on exon 6 ­ G6PD Mediterranean and
G6PD Sibari. The G6PD Mediterranean
mutation is a single C to T transition at
nucleotide 563 (C563T), previously demon-
strated in Mediterranean Middle East popu-
lations.24 In the study by Gari et al.,23 51.1%
of those found to have G6PD deficiency had
the G6PD Mediterranean mutation.
However, other studies in the United Arab
Emirates,25 Oman,26 Kuwait27 and eastern
Saudi Arabia28 report higher frequencies for
the G6PD Mediterranean mutation (ranging
between 71.4% and 84%). As with other
coding sequence polymorphisms, linkage
disequilibrium has been shown to exist
between the Mediterranean C563T mutation
and a silent C to T transition at nucleotide
1311 in Europe5 and the Middle East,25 but
not in Italy5 or India.29 The G6PD Sibari
mutation, which is an A to G transition at
nucleotide 634, was only seen in 2.1% of
those with G6PD deficiency in the study by
Gari et al.23 The presence of this polymorph-
ism in a western Saudi population suggests
that there is considerable genetic heterogen-
eity in this region. A study by Al-Jaouni
et al.8 in the same region investigated poly-
morphisms in 42 adults and 68 neonates
with G6PD deficiency; G6PD Mediterranean
was seen in 89.1%, G6PD Aures (T to C at
nucleotide 143) in 10.0% and G6PD
Chatham (G to A at nucleotide 1003) in
0.9%. None of the subjects showed the G6PD
AÀ mutation.8 A study by Warsy and El-
Hazmi30 identified the G6PD AÀ mutationin
Alharbi and Khan 1165
those with G6PD deficiency in various sev-
eral provinces in Saudi Arabia; the central
province had the lowest frequency (0.74% in
men and 0.09% in women).
Previously we reported that angiotensin-
converting enzyme gene polymorphism was
associated with G6PD deficiency;7 however,
specific G6PD polymorphisms were not
investigated in this earlier study.
In the present study, 2100 Saudi males
were screened for G6PD deficiency, of
whom 100 (4.76%) were found to be
G6PD deficient. On molecular characteriza-
tion, 6% of those with G6PD deficiency had
the A376G mutation and 2% had the
G202A mutation, giving an overall fre-
quency of the G6PD AÀ mutation of 2%.
However, this was not statistically signifi-
cantly different compared with the fre-
quency of this mutation in controls.
The findings of the present study were
limited by the small sample size.
In conclusion, the G6PD AÀ variant was
shown to occur at a low rate in a Saudi male
population and does not appear to be a
major cause of G6PD deficiency in this
region. These findings need to be confirmed
by larger studies with more extensive
molecular genetic characterization.
