Introduction
Aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death
among the elderly.1 Risk factors include dementia,
dehydration, reduced swallowing function, and the
requirement for sputum suctioning due to poor self-
drainage.1 One factor that determines self-drainage
ability and airway clearance is cough intensity.2
Diminished cough intensity is considered to increase
the risk of atelectasis and pneumonia,3,4 An indica-
tor of voluntary cough intensity is cough peak flow
(CPF), the measurement of which has been shown
to be both reliable4 and reproducible.5
A voluntary cough consists of deep inspiration,
compression following closure of the glottis, and
rapid expiration following opening of the glottis.
These procedures are closely related to respira-
tory function indicators.2 However, the effects of
sex on CPF is unknown, although there are
known anatomical differences in the larynx
between men and women.6 Furthermore, men
and women are known to exhibit different pre-
dominant breathing patterns (abdominal breath-
ing in men versus thoracic breathing in women).7
In addition, although respiratory function and
respiratory muscle strength are reported to decline
with age,8 reports on the relationship between age
and CPF are inconsistent.4,5 Maintenance and
improvement of CPF are known to be important
for preserving self-drainage ability. Consequently,
determining the factors affecting CPF in men and
women and elucidating the relationship between
Voluntary cough intensity and its influencing
factors differ by sex in community-dwelling
adults

Abstract
Background: Cough peak flow (CPF) is widely used for measuring voluntary cough intensity.
However, the respective factors that affect CPF are not known. The aim of this study was to
determine the factors affecting CPF by sex in community-dwelling adults.
Method: We recruited participants using posters exhibited at a public gymnasium.
Participation was voluntary, and all participants provided informed consent. Nonsmoking
community residents (102 males, 49.6 ± 20.2 years of age; 101 females, 51.4 ± 18.4 years
of age) participated in this study. The main outcome measures were sex differences in CPF,
respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength, thorax extension, and grip strength. Factors
affecting CPF by sex were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.
Results: All parameters were higher in men than in women. CPF was affected by thorax
expansion at the tenth rib, inspiratory muscle strength and forced expiration in 1 s in men, and
thorax expansion at the tenth rib, inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory muscle power in
women. A weak negative correlation was observed between CPF and age (p = -0.24, p < 0.05)
in women.
Conclusions: The factors affecting CPF differed by sex in community-dwelling adults.

CPF and age are considered important for thera-
peutic intervention aimed at maintaining and
improving voluntary cough intensity.
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine
the respective factors that affect CPF in men and
women separately and to determine the relation-
ship between CPF and age.
Methods
Participants
A total of 203 nonsmoking community-dwelling
adults (102 men, age: 49.6 ± 20.2 years; 101
women, age: 51.4 ± 18.4 years) were recruited
using posters displayed at a community sports
facility. Participation was voluntary, and all par-
ticipants provided informed consent. Participants
with respiratory illness or missing data were
excluded from analysis (Table 1). Sample size was
determined using a power analysis program for sta-
tistical tests (G*Power 3.1.9.2, Heinrich-Heine-
University Dusseldorf University, Dusseldorf);
given an alpha of 0.05, a desired power of 0.95,
and an effect size of 0.35, the desired sample size
was 55. However, to perform multiple regression
analysis, we need more than 90 samples for both
sexes because we require approximately 10 times
the number of explanatory variables to be input.9
Measurements of CPF, height, body weight, res-
piratory function, respiratory muscle strength,
thoracic excursion, and grip strength were rand-
omized. All measurements, besides height and
body weight, were performed with the partici-
pants sitting upright, the soles of their feet touch-
ing the floor, and their heads and necks in a
neutral position.
Cough peak flow measurement
To measure CPF, a face mask was attached to a
peak flow meter (Assess Peak Flow Meter
HS710012, Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA,
USA).4,5 Peak flow was measured during peak
voluntary coughing from maximal inspiratory
level in the face mask. All participants were
instructed to cough with maximal effort. Three
measurements were performed, with the highest
value adopted for analysis.
Respiratory function measurement
Respiratory function tests were conducted with an
electronic spirometer (SpiroShift SP-470, Fukuda
Denshi, Tokyo, Japan). The following parameters
were measured: peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital
capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
), inspiratory
reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume
(ERV), and inspiratory capacity (IC).
Respiratory muscle strength measurement
Respiratory muscle strength was ascertained by
measuring maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP)
as an indicator of inspiratory muscle strength and
maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) as an indi-
cator of expiratory muscle strength.10 As with res-
piratory function tests, measurements were
conducted with an electronic spirometer (Spiro
Shift SP-470, Fukuda Denshi), to which a nose
clip was attached and a mouthpiece was affixed.
Thoracic excursion measurement
Thoracic excursion was measured with a thoracic
excursion measurement device (T.K.K. 3345,
Takei Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd., Niigata,
Japan). After 30 s of quiet breathing, participants
were verbally instructed to perform maximum
inspiration and maximal expiration. The differ-
ence in thoracic circumference between maxi-
mum inspiration and maximum expiration was
defined as thoracic excursion. Measurements
were taken at the axilla, the xiphoid process, and
the tenth rib level.

Grip strength measurement
Grip strength, an indicator of general muscle
strength,11 was measured with a baseline hydrau-
lic hand dynamometer (W50175 Baseline hydrau-
lic hand dynamometer, Nihon 3B Scientific, Inc,
Niigata, Japan). Participants gripped the
dynamometer with a neutral wrist position while
seated upright with the shoulders in a neutral
position and the knees flexed at 90°. During
measurement, the participants were encouraged
to exert maximum grip strength. Measurements
were performed twice for both hands, with the
highest value adopted for analysis.
Statistical processing
Men and women have been reported to exhibit
anatomical differences in the larynx and to have
different breathing patterns7; therefore, we ana-
lyzed men and women separately. Fifteen male
participants demonstrated a ceiling effect in CPF
measurement and were therefore excluded. Thus,
for analysis, we ultimately incorporated 87 men
(age: 50.1 ± 19.8 years) and 101 women (age:
51.4 ± 18.4 years). For all items, after perform-
ing normality tests using the Smirnov-Grubbs
outlier test, measured values were compared
between men and women. Items demonstrating
normality were analyzed with Welch's t test, while
items not demonstrating normality were analyzed
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.12
Stepwise multiple regression analyses for factors
affecting CPF were performed separately for men
and women. Instances where predictive formulas
using height and body weight are represented
with formulas using other variables, such as res-
piratory function8 and respiratory muscle
strength,9 involve covariance.13 In this study,
CPF was used as the dependent variable in multi-
ple regression analysis, and the explanatory vari-
ables were PEF; VC; FVC; FEV1
; IRV; ERV; IC;
MIP; MEP; and thoracic excursion, as measured
at the axilla, the xiphoid process, and the tenth
rib, as well as grip strength. Age, height, and
weight were excluded as explanatory variables
because these were involved in the formulas for
calculating other variables.
The relationships between age and MIP, MEP,
and CPF were analyzed using Pearson's rank
correlation coefficient. Statistical analysis was
performed using Excel Statistics 2015 (Social
Information Service Co., Ltd., Nishi-Shinjuku,
Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo) with the level of statistical
significance set at p < 0.05.
Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the Niigata University
of Health and Welfare Institutional Review Board
(17520 ­ 140811). Participants received a verbal
explanation of the study, and written informed
consent was obtained.
Results
All items demonstrated a normal distribution,
except for body weight in women. Men demon-
strated significantly higher values than women for
all items, except for age (Table 2).
Correlation between age and maximum
inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory
pressure, and cough peak flow
We found no significant correlation between MIP
and age in women (r = -0.08, p = 0.43) or in
men (r = -0.15, p = 0.15). Additionally, we
found no significant correlation between MEP
and age in women (r = 0.15, p = 0.14) or in men
(r = 0.04, p = 0.72). Although no significant cor-
relation between CPF and age was observed in
men, a significant, although weak, negative cor-
relation was observed between CPF and age in
women (r = -0.24, p < 0.05; Figures 1 and 2).
Factors affecting cough peak flow
Thoracic excursion at the tenth rib, MIP, and FEV1
were adopted as factors affecting CPF in men,
while thoracic excursion at the tenth rib, IRV, and
MEP were adopted for women (Table 3). The fol-
lowing regression equations were obtained.

Discussion
This study is the first to examine factors affecting
CPF and the relationship between CPF and age

adults, separately. Men were found to demon-
strate significantly higher values than women on
all measurement items except for age. In terms of
factors affecting CPF, thoracic excursion at the
tenth rib was adopted for both men and women,
MIP and FEV1
were adopted for men only, while
IRV and MEP were adopted for women only;
thus, the factors affecting CPF were found to dif-
fer between men and women. A significant,
although weak, relationship between CPF and
age was observed only in women.
In comparisons of measurement items between
men and women, men demonstrated significantly
greater height and body weight than women.
Height and body weight affect respiratory function
and respiratory muscle strength;10 this may explain
why men demonstrated significantly higher values
for respiratory function and respiratory muscle
strength than did women. Furthermore, the sig-
nificantly greater height and body weight in men
than in women may also be the reason for the
larger cross-sectional muscle area and greater mus-
cle force in men than in women. Additionally, the
fact that thoracic excursion expands and contracts
the thorax by the action of the respiratory muscles
may be why men, with their larger cross-sectional
muscle area and greater muscle force, demon-
strated significantly higher values for thoracic
excursion than did women.

Based on their functions, respiratory muscles are
divided into inspiratory muscles and expiratory
muscles. When inspiratory muscles contract, the
diaphragm descends towards the abdomen, while
the anterior chest expands longitudinally and then
horizontally as the ribs are lowered, thus expanding
the lungs.14 Contraction of expiratory muscles
increases abdominal pressure, which is considered
to aid expiration.15 Since it is useful to determine
and treat the problematic procedures in cough-
ing,16 we examined the factors affecting CPF from
the perspective of kinematics. The methods used to
measure maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax)
and maximum expiratory pressure (PEmax) were
based on guidelines of the American Thoracic
Society. We believe that one of the reasons that our
observed values were smaller than previous reports
is due to the geographic origin of our study sample.
Chen and Kuo17 established that Asian people have
lower muscle strength than European people.
The single factor affecting CPF in both men and
women was thoracic excursion at the tenth rib.
The diaphragm, which is the main inspiratory
muscle, and the transverse abdominal muscle, the
internal abdominal oblique muscle, and the exter-
nal abdominal oblique muscle, which are the
main expiratory muscles, are attached at the tenth
rib. During inspiration, excursion of the tenth rib
results in extension of the attached transverse
abdominal muscle, abdominal oblique muscles,
and rectus abdominis. This extension, in turn,
increases the tension of these muscles, which is
considered to reflect larger inspired volumes dur-
ing the first phase of cough and increase the mus-
cle force exerted during expiration.
However, other factors affecting CPF differed
between men and women. MIP and FEV1
were
influential in men, while IRV and MEP played a
role in women. Men tend to exhibit abdominal
breathing7 and are thus considered to exert dia-
phragm strength easily. During deep inspiration in
coughing, the diaphragm functions intensely and
expands the thorax, thereby triggering inspiratory
action,14 which may explain the role of MIP.
Diaphragm function is also correlated with inspir-
atory muscle strength and increases the inspired
volume during inspiration.14 Inspiration early dur-
ing the coughing process is necessary for increas-
ing total lung capacity, and a high lung capacity
improves the expiratory flow rate.7 Therefore, it is
plausible that the tendency of men to exhibit
abdominal breathing permits rapid reduction of
intrathoracic volume and complete expiration of
ERV, which explains the role of FEV1
.
For women, who predominantly exhibit thoracic
breathing,7 deep inspiration by primarily using
the strength of the diaphragm is difficult; thus, it
is plausible that deep inspiration in women also
uses the activity of the intercostal muscles. The
fact that the intercostal muscles exhibit inspira-
tory action and increase inspiratory volume15
may explain the role of IRV in affecting CPF.
Furthermore, rapid expiration using the abdomi-
nal muscles may be difficult for women, whose
abdominal muscles exhibit less action during
expiration than do those of men.7 The internal
intercostal muscles exhibit not only inspiratory
action, but also forced expiratory action.15 During
voluntary coughing, these muscles are mobilized,
thereby increasing intra-abdominal pressure and

reinforcing compression following closure of the
glottis. The fact that contraction of the internal
intercostal muscles lowers the ribs and reduces
the intrathoracic volume15 may explain the role of
MEP in modulation of CPF in women.
Based on the above, although both men and
women are affected by deep inspiration and
strong expiration during coughing, sex differ-
ences were observed in the factors affecting vol-
untary coughing. The results of the present
study indicate that during deep inspiration, men
demonstrate the effect of strength, whereas
women demonstrate the effect of volume; while
during strong expiration, men demonstrate the
effect of force, whereas women demonstrate the
effect of strength. These results suggest that for
maintaining and improving CPF, which is
important for preserving self-drainage ability,
more detailed individual therapeutic interven-
tions are possible for coughing in men and
women, respectively.
In terms of the relationship between CPF and
age, a weak negative correlation was observed
among women only. Women demonstrate greater
age-related morphological changes and greater
vertebral deformation associated with reduced
bone density than do men, as well as age-related
kyphosis of the spine and expanded thoracic
anteroposterior diameter. Expansion of the tho-
racic anteroposterior diameter, which puts the
diaphragm in an extended position and leads to
diminished respiratory muscle strength,8 is thus
likely to affect CPF. This effect of expansion of
the thoracic anteroposterior diameter may be
why women demonstrate a significant weak neg-
ative correlation between CPF and age. Another
possible reason that may explain the relationship
between CPF and age in women is age-related
decline of MEP. MEP is generated from expira-
tory muscles, and muscle strength declines with
age.4 Although we did not observe any age-
related decline in MEP, any changes in MEP
might be reflected in the relationship between
CPF and age.
The present study has some limitations. First, the
participants were healthy individuals recruited at a
community athletic facility, thus, the results of
this study may not be directly applicable to elderly
individuals or patients with respiratory illness.
Although it will be necessary to verify our results
in the elderly and in patients with respiratory
diseases in the future, the findings obtained in this
study can be referred to in developing strategies
for improving coughing ability. Second, we did
not measure the intrathoracic pressure and
abdominal pressure based on the limited time to
measure in the gymnasium. Cough is reported to
be related to both intrathoracic pressure and intra-
peritoneal pressure.3,5,6 Because there are many
influences on cough, future research will be neces-
sary to clarify our results. Third, CPF was the pri-
mary parameter of interest in this study, and the
exclusion of all those with the strongest CPF lim-
its the ability to generalize this study's results.
Inclusion of those participants' data could have
altered the relationships found with the associated
factors. Finally, although Smith and colleagues18
demonstrated that operating volume is a determi-
nant of CPF, we were unable to control the oper-
ating volume among the participants.
Despite these limitations, the present study can
be used to compare such participants with healthy
participants. The present study could also be
used to aid in maintaining, improving, and pre-
venting decline in voluntary cough intensity.
Because the present study is a cross-sectional
study, changes in CPF should be tracked longitu-
dinally in the future in order to determine the
effect of age on CPF.
