Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures
Abstract
Background: limited information on the prevalence of osteoporosis and VFxs in men in high-risk populations is available.
The choice of reference values for dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is debated. We evaluated the prevalence of osteopor-
osis and vertebral deformities in a population-based sample of men.
Methods: bone mineral density (BMD) was measured and vertebral deformities assessed using DXA and VFx assessment
(VFA), respectively, in a random sample of 600 Danish men aged 60­74 years. Osteoporosis was defined as a T-score of
-2.5 or less.
Results: the study population was comparable with the background population with regard to age, body mass index and co-
morbidity. Osteoporosis was diagnosed in less than 1% of the participants at inclusion. Using Danish and NHANES III ref-
erence data, 10.2 and 11.5% of the study population had osteoporosis, respectively. In all, 6.3% participants had at least one
VFx. BMD was significantly lower in participants with vertebral deformities, but only 24% of these cases had osteoporosis.
Conclusions: osteoporosis and VFxs are prevalent in men aged 60­74 years. Although the majority of deformities were
present in individuals without osteoporosis, BMD was lower in patients with VFxs at all sites investigated. Male osteoporosis
was markedly underdiagnosed.
Keywords: men, osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, population based, elderly
Introduction
Osteoporosis is a leading cause of fractures in men [1]. The
lifetime risk of fractures in men older than 50 years has
been estimated to be 20% [2]. The worldwide distribution
of fractures is uneven as the prevalence of osteoporotic
fractures is higher in Scandinavian countries [3]. Since
osteoporotic fractures decrease quality of life [4] and in-
crease mortality [5], data on the epidemiology of osteopor-
osis are important for the planning of preventive efforts.
Population-based information on the prevalence of osteo-
porosis and vertebral fracture (VFx) in men from high-risk
populations is, however, limited.
Bone mineral density (BMD) and VFxs are predictive of
future VFx as well as non-spine fractures independently of
other risk factors in men [6]. The lifetime risk of a clinical VFx
has been estimated to be 8.6% in Swedish men [2]. Because
only 25­33% of VFxs are diagnosed clinically [7], this fracture
type is commonly a missed opportunity for treatment.
In a large prospective study on VFxs in men, 87% of
the incident VFxs occurred in participants with T-scores >
-2.5 [6]. This questions the use of DXA to detect indivi-
duals at high risk of prevalent and future VFxs.
VFx assessment (VFA) is based on lateral images
obtained from a bone densitometer, and the method allows
for evaluation of prevalent fractures without the radiation
dose of conventional radiography [8]. Although fractures
observed by use of VFA predict future spine fractures in
women independently of age and BMI [9], information on
the ability of VFA to detect incident fractures is limited.
Nevertheless, low radiation exposure, the possibility of
combining DXA and an assessment of VFx and the high
sensitivity of VFA to detect moderate and severe fractures
suggest that the method is useful as an addition to assess-
ment of BMD [10].
The aims of the present study were to evaluate the
prevalence of osteoporosis as defined by a T-score of less
than or equal to -2.5 at the total hip, femoral neck or
lumbar spine in a population-based sample of elderly men,
to determine the prevalence of VFxs using VFA and the
impact of applying Danish reference values as opposed to
NHANESIII values.
Subjects and methods
Subjects
Participants in the study were recruited from a random
sample of the background population issued by the Danish
Civil Registration System. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the
inclusion. First, 4,975 men aged 60­74 years received a
questionnaire by mail. A second letter was issued to non-
respondents. Second, a subgroup of 1845 participants was
drawn as an age-stratified randomised sample (15 strata,
123 individuals in each) from the group of participants
who completed the questionnaire. These participants were
asked to take part in further study procedures, which was
accepted by 946. Telephone interviews were conducted in
864 of these respondents. Five respondents died, 106
declined further participation and another 56 were pre-
vented from attending the clinic due to current illnesses.
In all, 697 of the 803 eligible respondents agreed to take
part in a clinical assessment, and inclusion of the study par-
ticipants was completed once 600 had attended clinical
evaluation.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
Participants received written and oral information prior to
giving written consent. The study was performed in accord-
ance with the Helsinki declaration.

Body composition and bone mineral density
Body weight was measured in light clothing (SECA,
Germany) to the nearest 0.1 kg, while height was deter-
mined to the nearest 0.1 cm (Harpenden, Holtain, UK).
BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared
(kg/m2). BMD of the total hip, femoral neck and lumbar
spine were measured by use of dual X-ray absorptiometry
(H4500, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). T-scores were
calculated on the basis of a Danish male reference popula-
tion [11] [mean (SD): spine: 1.073 (0.125)], femoral neck
[0.948 (0.138)], total hip [1.078 (0.140)] and a combination
of Hologic reference values for the spine [1.084 (0.111)]
and NHANES III values for the hip regions [femoral
neck: 0.930 (0.136), total hip: 1.040 (0.144)].
Irrespective of reference material, osteoporosis was
defined (as in post-menopausal women) as a T-score at
total hip, femoral neck or the lumbar spine of equivalent to
or less than -2.5.
VFx assessment
The same densitometer was used for VFA on
postero-anterior and lateral (dual energy) images of the
spine (T4-L4). As described by Rea et al. [12], the cranial

Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures
and caudal endplates were marked by 6 points at the anter-
ior, middle and posterior part of the vertebrae. The
McCloskey algorithm [9] was used for the classification of
fractures. Although primarily validated in radiographs, the
algorithm has been shown to be operational in DXA as
well [9]. A vertebral fracture was defined by (i) a 3 SD
reduction in the ratio of vertebral heights compared
with reference values, either the anterior-posterior,
middle-posterior or between adjacent posterior ratios or
(ii) a 3 SD reduction in the posterior height as predicted
on the basis of the adjacent vertebrae [11]. Kappa values
for intra- and inter-observer agreement were 0.9 and
0.8, respectively.
Statistical methods
Results are presented as mean (SD) or median (25­75%
percentiles). The study population was compared with
the non-respondents using Pearson's Chi-square test or
Student's t-test.
Osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic as well as VFx and
non-VFx participants were compared by the use of
Chi-square test, Student's t-test or Mann­Whitney's U test.
The ability of osteoporosis to detect VFxs was evaluated by
calculation of the area under the curve, and kappa statistics
was used to evaluate the level of agreement between the
VFA interpretations.
All computations were performed using STATA v10
(STATA, College Station, TX, USA), and P-values less than
5% were considered significant.
This study was supported by the World-Anti Doping
Agency, Danish Ministry of Culture and Institute of Clinical
Research, University of Southern Denmark.
Results
The study population and those not included in the study
were comparable with regard to BMI and self-reported
chronic illnesses, though smoking and pulmonary disease
were observed less frequently among respondents, and a
higher proportion of the study population reported that
they were living with a partner, participating in sports or
had a higher education (Table 1). In all, two participants
reported a diagnosis of osteoporosis at inclusion.
BMD was assessed in 585 participants corresponding to
98% of the study population (not technically possible in
15). Using Danish or NHANES III and Hologic
(NHANES III for hip BMD, Hologic for the spine) refer-
ence values resulted in a prevalence of osteoporosis in the
study population of 10.2, and 11.5%, respectively (Table 2).
Osteoporosis was more common in the total hip and
femoral neck when Danish reference values were used (4.4
versus 0.5% and 5.8 versus 4.1%, both P < 0.01), whereas
the Danish reference values resulted in a lower prevalence
of osteoporosis in the lumbar spine (4.6 versus 8.0%,
P < 0.01) (Table 2).
VFA could be performed in 94% of the participants
while evaluation of the remaining scans was impossible due
to severe arthritis and scoliosis in 1.2% and poor quality of
the scans in the remaining cases. Vertebral bodies were less
frequently visible in the upper part of the spine. Thus,
T6-L4 and T8-L4 were visible in 48 and 95%, respectively
(Table 3). In all, 35 (6.3%) participants had at least one
VFx comprising a total of 42 fractures consisting of 26
thoracic and 16 lumbar fractures. One participant had three
fractures and five had two fractures. The fractures were
most prevalent in the thoracolumbar junction and mid-
thoracic spine (see the Supplementary data available in Age
and Ageing online, Appendix S1). In all, 14.8­15.7% had

osteoporosis and/or VFx depending on reference values
used (Table 2).
Participants with osteoporosis as defined by Danish ref-
erence values were of similar age as non-osteoporotic
(Table 3). In men aged 60­64, 65­69 and 70­74 years, the
prevalence of osteoporosis was 6.6, 12.1 and 11.5%, re-
spectively (P = 0.06). BMI was lower in men with osteopor-
osis, intake of alcohol was lower and smoking more
prevalent (Table 4).
Individuals with VFxs had lower BMD at all sites
(Table 3). In men aged 60­64, 65­69 and 70­74 years, the
prevalence of VFxs was 2.8, 9.1 and 5.9%, respectively
(NS).
The proportion of individuals with a family history of
osteoporosis or hip fracture or a sedentary lifestyle was
comparable in osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic as well as
vertebral and non-VFx participants (Table 3).
Data on VFA and BMD was available in 92% of the
participants. Twenty-four per cent of those with a VFx had
osteoporosis, whereas 1.5% had osteoporosis and a VFx.
The diagnostic utility of BMD measurements for detec-
tion of co-existing VFxs was independent of the reference
values used (area under the curve: 0.571 and 0.566, respect-
ively). The sensitivity of DXA using Danish and
NHANESIII reference values and a T-score of -2.5 to
detect the presence of a concomitant VFx was the same
(24%), whereas the specificity was 91 and 90%, respectively.
Positive and negative predictive values for BMD using
Danish reference values were 14 and 95% and the corre-
sponding results for NHANESIII were 13 and 95%.
Discussion
This study provided for the first time observational data on
the prevalence of osteoporosis as determined by DXA on a
random sample of elderly Danish men. On the basis of
local reference values [11], 10% of men aged 60­74 years
had osteoporosis. Using NHANES III hip and Hologic
lumbar spine reference values provided clinically similar
estimates of osteoporosis in the study population. In con-
trast, there appeared to be substantial differences in the
prevalence of osteoporosis if only one region was evaluated,
which may be explained by differences in genetics and the
distribution of lifestyle factors.
Based on normal Danish values for BMD, the preva-
lence of osteoporosis in Danish men has previously been
estimated to be 17.7% in those aged more than 50 years
[13]. Our observations are not in accordance with these
results, which is probably due to the limited range of age
covered in our study. BMD has been shown to decrease and
the prevalence of VFxs as depicted on radiographs increase
with age in men [7, 19], therefore, the age of the participants
is likely to have considerable impact on the prevalence of
both osteoporosis and VFxs. Our data do not support such
age-related differences, but this may be due to the limited
number of participants, the relative low prevalence of VFxs
or selection bias, e.g. lower prevalence of smoking and pul-
monary disease among those included in the study.
Six per cent of our participants had a VFx on the basis
of VFA, and most of the VFxs were observed in the thor-
acic spine, which is in accordance with previous studies
[14]. The prevalence of fractures in our study was lower
than the 12% observed in the 50­79-year-old European
men [15] and 32% seen in US men of a mean age of 69
years. In contrast, the result is higher compared with a
Finnish study [16], showing a prevalence of 2.8% in men
aged 75+ years. These differences are likely explained by
the method used for the evaluation of fractures, differences
in the diagnostic cut-off and in the recruitment of study
participants.

Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures
We cannot account for the mechanism causing the
observed fractures. Previous studies reported that the ma-
jority of VFxs are due to low-energy trauma or of
unknown origin, whereas only 18­26% of the fractures
were caused by high-energy trauma [6, 17]. The lower levels
of BMD observed in study participants with a VFx indicate
that these fractures are associated with bone health and not
merely due to high-energy trauma. Even if the latter was
the case, high-energy trauma fractures have been associated
with increased risk of further fractures [6], suggesting that
the observed fractures confer significant risk of future
fractures.
The prevalence of VFxs was 10­13% in the US MrOS,
which included community-dwelling men of significantly
higher age than those in our study [18]. Information on in-
cident VFxs is limited. In the US MrOS, the incidence was
shown to be 2.2/1,000 person-years. Osteoporosis was sig-
nificantly more prevalent in those experiencing a VFx (13
versus 2%), but the majority of fractures occurred in indivi-
duals without osteoporosis [6].
Owing to the cross-sectional design of our study, we
were unable to interpret the sensitivity of osteoporosis as
defined by a T-score equal to or less than -2.5 to identify
future VFxs. Using DXA for detection of concomitant VFx
in the study population resulted in a sensitivity of 24%. In
the Rotterdam study [19], the sensitivity of DXA, i.e. osteo-
porosis as defined on the basis of DXA, to identify
persons who would experience an incident non-VFx was
estimated to be 44 and 21% in women and men, respect-
ively. These results suggest that T-score alone provides an
inadequate evaluation of fracture risk.
VFA rather than X-ray was used to detect VFxs in the
present study. Compared with radiographs, VFA appears to
be less reliable in detecting grade 1 fractures in the upper
thoracic spine; however, conventional X-ray evaluations are
also less precise in this region [20]. We used the McCloskey
algorithm for the evaluation of the VFA. This algorithm
has been shown to predict incident fractures as identified
by radiographs in both men and women [21, 22]. This algo-
rithm has also been applied to VFA and results in women
showed that the McCloskey algorithm was able to predict
incident fractures independent of several factors including
BMD [9]. Although fractures are less common in men,
there are no indications suggesting that the method is in-
appropriate in men.
Our results on VFA may have been influenced by pro-
blems of detecting grade I fractures, and it is likely that
radiographs would have allowed evaluation of a larger pro-
portion of vertebrae. Although most fractures occur
between T7 and L3 [23], our estimate of the prevalence of
VFx's is probably conservative. The present study is also
weakened by the infrequency of osteoporosis in the study
population due to the age of the study population, and the
results may only be valid to Danish men aged 60­74 years.
Our study has some strengths. The use of a population-
based sample of men limited the risk of selection bias.
Acquisition of data by questionnaire in non-participants
allowed us to demonstrate that the study population with
the exception of certain lifestyle and social factors was
comparable with the general population of age- and sex-
matched men. Nevertheless, we believe the result provide a
reasonable estimate of osteoporosis in elderly, Danish men.
Currently, the International Society of Clinical
Densitometry currently recommends the use of VFA in men
with a low T-score and one of several risk factors [24]. Our
data suggest that VFA should be used in all men evaluated
with DXA.
In conclusion, very few reported osteoporosis at inclu-
sion but 10% had osteoporosis and 6% had at least one
VFx. There was no overall substantial difference between
results derived from using Danish and NHANES-III refer-
ence values but there were significant differences with
regard to the prevalence of osteoporosis in specific regions.
Our data demonstrate that VFA adds important informa-
tion on bone status not captured by T-scores derived from
DXA.
Key points
· Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures common in elderly
men.
· Osteoporosis markedly underdiagnosed in men.
· No overall difference in the prevalence of osteoporosis
between Danish and NHANESIII reference values.
