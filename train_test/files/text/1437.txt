Background. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection causes permanent disabilities in more than 5500
children each year in the United States. The likelihood of congenital infection and disability is highest for infants
whose mothers were CMV seronegative before conception and who acquire infection during pregnancy.
Methods. To provide a current, nationally representative estimate of the seroprevalence of CMV in the United
States and to investigate trends in CMV infection, serum samples from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004 were tested for CMV-specific immunoglobulin G antibody, and results
were compared with those from NHANES III (1988­1994). Individuals aged 6­49 years (21,639 for NHANES III
and 15,310 for NHANES 1999­2004) were included.
Results. For NHANES 1999­2004, the overall age-adjusted CMV seroprevalence was 50.4%. CMV seroprev-
alence was higher among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children compared with non-Hispanic white
children and increased more quickly in subsequent age groups. CMV seropositivity was independently associated
with older age, female sex, foreign birthplace, low household income, high household crowding, and low household
education. Compared with NHANES 1988­1994, the overall age-adjusted CMV seroprevalence for NHANES 1999­
2004 was not significantly different.
Conclusions. Many women of reproductive age in the United States are still at risk of primary CMV infection
during pregnancy. There is an urgent need for vaccine development and other interventions to prevent and treat
congenital CMV. The substantial disparities in CMV risk among seronegative women suggest that prevention
strategies should include an emphasis on reaching racial or ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic
status.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the Herpesvir-
idae family, is endemic throughout the world [1]. Most
CMV infections are mild or asymptomatic; however,
CMV can cause serious disease in immunocompro-
mised individuals and fetuses. Among newborns, CMV
is the leading cause of congenital infection in the de-
veloped world [2]. Each year, of an estimated 28,000

children born with congenital CMV infection in the
United States, 150 die, and 15500 have permanent
disabilities, such as hearing loss, intellectual disability,
psychomotor delay, speech and language disabilities,
behavioral disorders, visual impairment, and cerebral
palsy [3, 4].
CMV is acquired through contact with CMV-infected
body fluids of individuals with symptomatic or asymp-
tomatic CMV infection [1, 5, 6]. Congenital CMV in-
fection is the result of intrauterine transmission of
CMV infection from mother to fetus. A fetus is at high-
est risk of CMV infection when a mother has a primary
(ie, first) infection during pregnancy [7, 8]. Compared
with a maternal nonprimary infection (ie, reinfection
or reactivation), a maternal primary infection is more
likely to transmit CMV from mother to fetus (1% vs
32%) and is also more likely to result in severe, long-
term sequelae in children born with congenital CMV

infection [6, 8, 9]. Women who are CMV seropositive before
pregnancy are 69% less likely to give birth to a CMV-infected
newborn [10].
The best way to assess the prevalence of CMV infection is
through seroprevalence studies of CMV-specific immunoglob-
ulin (Ig) G antibody. A previous nationally representative se-
roprevalence study of CMV infection in the United States,
which used data from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) III (1988­1994), indicated that
large proportions of women of reproductive age are susceptible
to primary infection during pregnancy [11].
The purpose of this study was to provide current estimates
of CMV seroprevalence in the United States and to investigate
trends in CMV infection by comparing seroprevalence data from
NHANES III (1988­1994) with data from NHANES 1999­2004.
National seroprevalences, particularly among women of repro-
ductive age, are important for establishing accurate estimates of
the risk of congenital CMV infection, for quantifying the po-
tential target population for a CMV vaccine, and for identifying
risk groups that should be a high priority to receive behavioral
interventions and/or vaccine once one becomes available [12,
13]. National trends in CMV infection have not been examined
previously and can provide insight into the rate of change in
CMV seroprevalence during the past decade as a function of
socioeconomic and demographic factors.
METHODS
Survey sample and design. NHANES is a series of cross-
sectional surveys conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) [14]. Data are collected through household in-
terviews, physical examinations, and blood sampling [14]. To
select a nationally representative sample, NHANES uses a com-
plex multistage probability cluster sample design, discussed in
greater detail elsewhere [15]. This study was approved by the
institutional review board of the CDC, and participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Since 1999,
NHANES has been administered as a continuous annual sur-
vey released in 2-year increments. The NHANES 1999­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004 data sets were combined to form
NHANES 1999­2004. NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004
oversampled certain population groups to increase the reliabil-
ity and precision of estimates for each of the groups [14, 16].
Individuals included in this study were those aged 6­49 years
who were interviewed and examined, consented to be a part of
additional testing, had serum samples available for testing, and
had a nonequivocal CMV test result. The final study sample
included 21,639 individuals for NHANES III and 15,310 indi-
viduals for NHANES 1999­2004. Serum sample availability was
fairly uniform across variable categories except for the 6- to 11-
year-old age group, in which greater percentages of persons were
without available serum specimens. To address the impact of
missing CMV data on the generalizability of the study results,
we created adjusted weights by multiplying the original NCHS
weights by the weighted proportion of available serum samples
for that participant's sex, age, and race/ethnicity [11]. Seroprev-
alence analyses using the adjusted weights produced only slightly
different point estimates that were within 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) of estimates computed with the original NCHS
weights; therefore, NCHS weights were used for all subsequent
analyses.
Serologic testing. Laboratory methods for detecting CMV
IgG antibody in serum from NHANES 1999­2004 followed the
same procedures used previously for testing NHANES III sam-
ples [11]. To maximize testing sensitivity, specificity,andthrough-
put, serum samples were screened for CMV-specific IgG antibody
with the SeraQuest enzyme immunoassay (Quest International)
and the Triturus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay robot
(Grifols USA). Then serum samples with reactivities within a
narrow range of the SeraQuest assay cutoff were tested using
the VIDAS test (bioMe
´rieux Vitek). Discrepant results between
the SeraQuest and VIDAS tests were resolved with an immu-
nofluorescence assay (Bion Enterprises). All testing was con-
ducted by laboratory personnel at the CDC.
Measures. Variables of interest included sex, age (6­11, 12­
19, 20­29, 30­39, and 40­49 years), race or ethnicity (non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American), birthplace
(born in the 50 states, born in Mexico, born elsewhere), house-
hold income level (ratio of household income to the family's
appropriate poverty threshold: low [1.300], middle [1.301­
3.500], or high [3.501]), insurance status (covered or not cov-
ered by health insurance), household education level (less than
high school, high school diploma including Graduate Educa-
tional Development diploma, or more than high school), and
household crowding index (low [!0.5 person per room], average
[0.5­1 person per room], or high [11 person per room]). In-
dividuals not fitting into 1 of the 3 race/ethnicity groups were
classified as "other" in 1999­2004 univariate results but were
excluded from 1999­2004 multivariate analyses and comparisons
between results from 1988­1994 and 1999­2004. Household in-
come level was based on the poverty income ratio variable, which
is the ratio of household income to the family's appropriate
poverty threshold [17]. For the 1999­2004 analyses, household
education level represented the highest education level of the
household reference person or the reference person's spouse, if
applicable. For comparison with 1988­1994 data, only the ref-
erence person's education level was used to be consistent with
the NHANES III household education variable definition.
Statistical analysis. SUDAAN software, version 10.0 (RTI
International), was used for statistical analyses. All prevalence
estimates were weighted to represent the civilian, noninstitu-

tionalized US population and to account for the unequal prob-
ability of sampling and nonresponse to the household interview
and physical examination. To reduce potential confounding by
age, age-adjusted estimates were computed using the direct
method to the 2000 US Census population [18].
For analyses of the 1999­2004 data, demographic factors
were first evaluated with adjustment for age using a general
linear contrast procedure. Next, logistic regression models
were used to assess the association between CMV seropositivity
and the demographic factors while adjusting for multiple co-
variates. The final logistic model included age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, household income level, birthplace (country of origin),
household education, crowding index, and an age by sex in-
teraction, age by race/ethnicity interaction, and race/ethnicity
by sex interaction. The Satterthwaite adjusted F test was used
to assess the statistical significance of variables and interac-
tions in the model. Model fit was evaluated using the Hosmer-
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit Satterthwaite-adjusted F test. Indi-
viduals with missing data on the variables in the multivariate
models were excluded.

Figure 1. Predictive margins (multivariate adjusted cytomegalovirus [CMV] seroprevalences) in the United States, National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004, stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The circles representing the female and male prevalences are
distinguished by the female (&) and male (() icons. To better distinguish between females and males, the circles representing the prevalences in
the 6­11-year-old age groups are plotted slightly above and below their true values; true prevalences are shown in the text next to the circles.
Because of interactions, logistic models were created for each
age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroup, as well as for combined
subgroups for sex and race/ethnicity (eg, non-Hispanic white
females) and sex and age (eg, 6- to 11-year-old girls). To aid
the interpretation of odds ratios (ORs), predictive margins were
computed using the PREDMARG statement in SUDAAN. Pre-
dictive margins are akin to adjusted seroprevalences; the pre-
dictive margin for a group represents the average predicted
response if all individuals in the sample had been in that group,
while controlling for all other covariates [19, 20]. The 95% CIs
of predictive margins were based on the actual degrees of free-
dom for each level of each variable.
Methods to compare the 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 data
were similar to those used for analyses of the 1999­2004 data,
except that a variable representing survey year (1 for NHANES
1998­1994 and 2 for NHANES 1999­2004) was forced into the
model. The final logistic model included age, sex, race/ethnic-
ity, household income level, birthplace, household education,
crowding index, and an age by sex, age by race/ethnicity, age
by household income level, race/ethnicity by sex, and age by
race/ethnicity by sex interaction. Because of numerous inter-
actions with age, logistic models were performed for each age
group. Additional stratifications were performed because of a
significant 3-way interaction among age, race/ethnicity, and sex.
RESULTS
NHANES 1999­2004. The overall age-adjusted seropreva-
lence of CMV infection for individuals 6­49 years old was
50.4% (Table 1). In age-adjusted analyses, CMV seropositivity
was significantly associated with female sex, non-Hispanic black
race and Mexican American ethnicity, older age, foreign birth-
place, low household income level, lack of insurance, low
household education, and high crowding index (Table 1).
For both females and males, multivariate-adjusted CMV se-
roprevalences were higher for non-Hispanic blacks and Mex-
ican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites (Table 2
and Figure 1). Overall CMV seroprevalences were higher for
non-Hispanic black and Mexican American 6­11-year-olds
(45.7% and 61.7%, respectively) compared with non-Hispanic
white children of the same age group (29.0%). Compared with
the 6­11-year age group, CMV seroprevalences for the 12­19-
year and 20­29-year age groups were significantly higher for
non-Hispanic blacks (OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2­2.1] and 4.1 [95%

[95% CI, 1.2­2.2] and 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1­4.9], respectively),
whereas CMV prevalences were not significantly higher by age
group among non-Hispanic whites until the 30­39-year age
group (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9­3.7). Among non-Hispanic blacks,
a strong association with CMV seropositivity (OR, 21.3; 95%
CI, 11.7­38.9) occurred in the 30­39-year age category (com-
pared with 6­11-year-olds). Examination of estimates by sex
and race indicated that this was due to a strong association for
women (OR, 26.0; 95% CI, 13.8­49.2) rather than men (OR,
3.6; 95% CI, 2.2­6.1) (Figure 2); CMV seroprevalences were
76.6% and 94.6% for non-Hispanic black women aged 20­29
years and 30­39 years, respectively, whereas seroprevalences
were 62.4% and 74.5% for non-Hispanic black men of the
corresponding age groups (Figure 1).
Household education level was significantly associated with
CMV seropositivity for females of all 3 race/ethnicities and non-
Hispanic black males (Figure 2). Those with an education level

of less than high school had higher CMV prevalences than those
with an education level of more than high school (57.8% vs
42.3% for non-Hispanic white females, 81.5% vs 72.7% for
non-Hispanic black females, 83.4% vs 73.9% for Mexican
American females, and 66.3% vs 58.6% for non-Hispanic black
males). Household crowding was significantly associated with
CMV seropositivity only for Mexican American females (69.4%
for the low crowding group, 78.6% for the average crowding
group, and 83.6% for the high crowding group) and for 1 of
the group comparisons for non-Hispanic white females (48.3%
for the average crowding group and 42.1% for the low crowding
group). Nevertheless, for all sex and racial or ethnic groups,
the ORs were greater than 1 and increased as the level of crowd-
ing increased (Figure 2). Low household income level was sig-
nificantly associated with CMV seropositivity for all race and
sex groups except non-Hispanic black males (Figure 2). Con-
versely, non-Hispanic black males were the only race-sex group
for which not having insurance was a significant risk factor for
CMV seropositivity (Figure 2). Mexican Americans born in
Mexico had higher CMV prevalences compared with those born
in the United States (OR for females, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.3­6.2; OR
for males, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.7­5.0). For non-Hispanic whites and
non-Hispanic blacks, sample sizes for the "other" birthplace
category were too small to make any inferences about an as-
sociation with CMV seropositivity.
Comparison of 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 data. The over-
all age-adjusted seroprevalence of CMV did not change sig-
nificantly from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004 (50.8% and 50.4%,
respectively) (Table 1). After stratifying by sex and race/eth-
nicity, there were a handful of statistically significant changes
in CMV seroprevalence among certain levels of age and house-
hold income, but no consistent patterns were observed. For
non-Hispanic whites, no significant differences were observed
for females; for males, the multivariate-adjusted CMV sero-
prevalences among 40­49-year-olds decreased between 1988­
1994 and 1999­2004 (from 49.9% to 40.3%). For non-Hispanic
black females, statistically significant increases occurred among
6­11-year-olds (from 38.6% to 48.7%) and 30­39-year-olds
(from 81.8% to 90.3%), and a decrease occurred among 40­
49-year-olds (from 94.4% to 88.5%) (Figure 3). For non-His-
panic black males, an increase in multivariate-adjusted CMV
seroprevalence was observed among 12­19-year-olds (from
43.4% to 52.7%); also, as with non-Hispanic black females, a
decrease occurred at the 40­49-year age level (from 86.3% to
69.8%) (Figure 3). For Mexican Americans, the only significant
difference between 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 was an increase
in age-adjusted CMV seroprevalence among males and females
within the middle household income level (from 70.9% to
75.2%).
DISCUSSION
CMV seroprevalence across most age, sex, and racial/ethnic
groups in the United States showed few changes between
1988­1994 and 1999­2004. Given this relative lack of tempo-
ral trends, differences in CMV seroprevalence by age approxi-
mate seroconversion rates among persons moving from one
age group to the next. Thus, we can conclude that among
the substantial proportion of US women who are CMV sero-
negative as they enter their reproductive years, many experience
1446 · CID 2010:50 (1 June) · Bate et al
seroconversion. For example, of the 45% of non-Hispanic
black women who are CMV seronegative during their teen
years, nearly all (8 of 9) seroconvert by the time they are in
their 30s. Approximately one-half of CMV-seronegative Mex-
ican American women and one-fourth of CMV-seronegative
non-Hispanic white women also seroconvert during the same
period. This means that many women are at risk of experiencing
a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, which is associated
with a higher risk of congenital infection [8] and permanent
damage to the child [21].
Such risk highlights the urgent need for interventions, such
as a vaccine, which can reduce the likelihood of adverse out-
comes, such as maternal infection, congenital infection, or
childhood disability. Although no licensed vaccines are cur-
rently available, a number are in various stages of develop-
ment, including a gB subunit vaccine that showed efficacy in
a recent phase 2 trial [22]. Several target populations have been
proposed for future vaccines, including women of reproductive
age [22], preadolescents [23], and children [24]. Our study
shows that all of these groups contain large proportions of
CMV-seronegative individuals who could be protected from
CMV infection by vaccination.
Sex, race or ethnicity, country of origin, and factors asso-
ciated with low socioeconomic status, such as crowding and
low household income, were all independently associated with
and substantially affected CMV seropositivity. These multiple
associations are not surprising, given the multiple ways that
CMV can be transmitted. The main transmission routes for
CMV infection are breast-feeding [5, 25], close contact with
young children [26­31], and intimate contact with adults (ie,
kissing or sexual intercourse) [27, 32, 33]. The chance of be-
coming infected depends primarily on 2 factors: the frequency
of these contacts and the likelihood that any given contact will
be with a person who is shedding CMV in their bodily fluids.
These factors differ for each of the main transmission routes
and change during a lifetime, making it difficult to precisely
explain what drives CMV seroprevalence results and what ac-
counts for racial or ethnic differences. For instance, possible
explanations include breast-feeding rates, household demo-
graphic factors and child care arrangements, and sexual be-
haviors and networks, all of which differ substantially by race
or ethnicity [34­39]. However, there is no clear correlation be-
tween these racial/ethnic variations in exposure to prominent
CMV transmission modes and the likelihood of being CMV
seropositive. Thus, although this study is useful for identifying
at-risk populations, it is less able to assess the relative impor-
tance of different modes of CMV transmission.
The major strengths of this study are that it was nationally
representative, reported a current estimate of CMV seroprev-
alence in the United States, and assessed time trends in the US
population as a whole. The major limitation was its cross-
sectional design (both NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004
were cross-sectional samples), which does not allow for the
definitive detection of a birth cohort effect. However, com-
parison of data between 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 indicated
that with the exception of some minor changes in CMV se-
roprevalences in the oldest age group, CMV seroprevalences
were relatively constant between individuals of the same age
who were born 10 years apart, suggesting that any birth cohort
effect was minimal and that incidence has not changed sub-
stantially in the recent past. Also, a cross-sectional design does
not reveal when seropositive individuals became infected with
CMV. Furthermore, the time-dependent variables, such as
crowding or household income level, were measured at only
one point in time (ie, the time of the NHANES survey). Thus,
it was impossible to determine whether the exposures of inter-
est occurred at a time that was relevant to the CMV infection.
In summary, many women of reproductive age in the United
States are still at risk of primary CMV infection during preg-
nancy. As a result, there is an urgent need for vaccine devel-
opment and other clinical and public health interventions that
can benefit children and their families. The substantial dispar-
ities in CMV risk among seronegative women suggest that pre-
vention strategies should include an emphasis on reaching racial
or ethnic minorities and women of low socioeconomic status.
