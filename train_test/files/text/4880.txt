ABSTRACT
OLs (oligodendrocytes) are the myelinating cells of the CNS
(central nervous system), wrapping axons in conductive
sheathes to ensure effective transmission of neural signals.
The regulation of OL development, from precursor to
mature myelinating cell, is controlled by a variety of
inhibitory and inductive signalling factors. The dorsal spinal
cord contains signals that inhibit OL development, possibly
to prevent premature and ectopic precursor differentiation.
The Wnt and BMP (bone morphogenic protein) signalling
pathways have been identified as dorsal spinal cord signals
with overlapping temporal activity, and both have similar
inhibitory effects on OL differentiation. Both these
pathways feature prominently in many developmental
processes and demyelinating events after injury, and they
are known to interact in complex inductive, inhibitive and
synergistic manners in many developing systems. The
interaction between BMP and Wnt signalling in OL
development, however, has not been extensively explored.
In the present study, we examine the relationship between
the canonical Wnt and BMP pathways. We use pharmaco-
logical and genetic paradigms to show that both Wnt3a
and BMP4 will inhibit OL differentiation in vitro. We also
show that when the canonical BMP signalling pathway is
blocked, neither Wnt3a nor BMP4 have inhibitory effects
on OL differentiation. In contrast, abrogating the Wnt
signalling pathway does not alter the actions of BMP4
treatment. Our results indicate that the BMP signalling
pathway is necessary for the canonical Wnt signal-
ling pathway to exert its effects on OL development, but
not vice versa, suggesting that Wnt signals upstream of
BMP.

INTRODUCTION
Myelin is an essential physiological structure, allowing for the
rapid and effective transmission of neural signals. Impaired
myelination, prevalent in disorders such as multiple sclerosis,
severely hampers the ability of neurons to communicate,
resulting in functional deficits and axonal degeneration (Trapp
et al., 1998; Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003; Edgar and Garbern, 2004).
Factors involved in regulating myelination during development
are often also involved in demyelinating disorders, and
understanding their actions is crucial to designing treatments
or therapies (Setoguchi et al., 2001; Armstrong et al., 2002; Liu
et al., 2008b; Zhang et al., 2009; Cate et al., 2010).
OLs (oligodendrocytes) are the myelinating cells of the CNS
(central nervous system). OLs are generated through a series
of specific developmental stages (Pringle and Richardson,
1993; Ono et al., 1995), during which they are exposed to a
range of signalling factors that can be inductive or inhibi-
tory, extracellular or intracellular (Miller, 2002). OPCs (OL
precursor cells) originate in ventricular zones at E12.5
(embryonic day 12.5) in the rodent CNS and migrate dorsally
and radially, expressing markers such as A2B5, NG2 and
PDGFr-a (platelet-derived growth factor receptor a). Once
differentiation begins, OPCs progress to immature OLs,
generating processes and expressing GalC (galactocerebro-
side). After contacting neurons, OPCs begin to extend
processes, express myelin proteins, including PLP (proteolipid
protein), MBP (myelin basic protein) and CNP (29,39 cyclic

nucleotide 39-phosphodiesterase), then ensheathe axons in
protein and lipid heavy myelin (Grinspan, 2002; Miller, 2002).
While the signals that influence this development are
beginning to be characterized, the extent of their interactions
remains to be fully explored.
Initially, signals in the ventral spinal cord, especially Shh
(sonic hedgehog), induce expression of transcription factors
essential for OL specification and development, including
Olig1 and Olig2 (Lu et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2000; Zhou and
Anderson, 2002). In contrast, signals emanating from the roof
plate in the dorsal spinal cord can inhibit this development
(Wada et al., 2000), possibly to control the exact times when
these cells reach and myelinate dorsal regions. There are,
however, dorsal populations of OPCs whose generation is
Shh independent, although their overall contributions ap-
pear to be limited and their distinct functions are unknown
(Cai et al., 2005; Kasai et al., 2005; Vallstedt et al., 2005;
Kessaris et al., 2006). Two families of dorsal signalling factors,
the BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins) and the Wnts, have
been shown to exert inhibitory effects on OPC differentiation.
BMPs are members of the TGFb (transforming growth
factor b) signalling family, and they have many roles in the
developing nervous system involving embryonic patterning,
cell proliferation, specification, differentiation and apoptosis
(Liem et al., 1995, 2000; Mehler et al., 1997; Wine-Lee et al.,
2004; See and Grinspan, 2009 for review). Of the Wnt and
BMP families, BMP has been more extensively investigated
with regard to OL development, exerting time- and stage-
specific effects. BMPs drastically inhibit OPC differentiation
into mature OLs, instead promoting astrogliogenesis
(Grinspan et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2004; Samanta and
Kessler, 2004; See et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2007).
The Wnts are another family of dorsal-secreted factors
involved in many of the same roles as BMPs in the nervous
system, including embryonic patterning, cell specification,
proliferation, migration and differentiation (Dorsky et al.,
1998; Coyle-Rink et al., 2002; Braun et al., 2003; Hirabayashi
et al., 2004; Karim et al., 2004; Kalani et al., 2008; Ulloa and
Marti, 2010 for review). Recent studies have investigated the
influence of canonical Wnt signalling on OL development,
both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the Wnts and BMPs
have similar effects. In spinal cord explants and OPC cultures,
ectopic Wnt3a application inhibits the differentiation of OPCs
into mature cells (Shimizu et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008; Fancy
et al., 2009; Feigenson et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009). Mutant
mice in which Wnt signalling is constitutively activated in
cells of OL lineage display an early developmental decrease
in mature OLs. This effect diminishes as the mice age,
however, suggesting that the importance of Wnt signalling
may vary over the course of OL development (Fancy et al.,
2009; Feigenson et al., 2009).
The interaction of BMPs and Wnts is well documented in a
variety of different systems, their expression is spatially and
temporally similar, and they are functionally involved in many
of the same processes. Their relationship, however, varies
based on tissue and developmental timeline: depending on
context, they can directly or indirectly be inductive,
antagonistic or synergistic (Soshnikova et al., 2003; Guo
and Wang, 2009; Itasaki and Hoppler, 2010 for review). There
is evidence that Wnt signalling prevents oligodendroglial
specification at the neural stem cell stage by up-regulating
BMPs through neurogenesis (Kasai et al., 2005), but how
these two pathways may interact in OL development has not
been explored in detail. An understanding of the interaction
of these pathways is an important avenue for developing
treatments and therapies for demyelinating events. It is well
documented that BMPs are up-regulated in CNS injury and
models of demyelinating disease (Setoguchi et al., 2001,
2004; See and Grinspan, 2009; Cate et al., 2010; Jablonska
et al., 2010), and can play roles in preventing remyelination.
In parallel, several recent studies have also found that
members and effectors of the Wnt family are up-regulated in
similar paradigms, and may have similar inhibitory effects on
recovery (Liu et al., 2008b; Fancy et al., 2009; Miyashita et al.,
2009; White et al., 2010).
Because Wnts and BMPs have similar sites of origin and
effects on OLs during development and demyelinating events,
we hypothesized that these two signalling factors mutually
regulate OL development. To explore this interaction, we have
employed effectors and antagonists of both canonical Wnt
and BMP signalling on both mutant and normal OPC cultures.
We find that while both BMP4 and Wnt3a inhibit the
differentiation of OPCs, when the BMP pathway is blocked ­
by either chemical or genetic means ­ the effects of both
Wnt3a and BMP4 are abrogated. In contrast, the effect of
BMP4 on OPC differentiation is not altered when the
canonical Wnt signalling pathway is blocked. Our results
indicate that the BMP pathway is necessary for canonical
Wnt signalling to inhibit OPC differentiation.
EXPERIMENTAL
Cell culture generation and treatment
All experiments were performed in accordance with the
guidelines set forth by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To generate
purified OPC cultures from newborn Sprague­Dawley rats or
mixed background mice, forebrain cells were harvested and
seeded on 100 mm Petri dishes in serum containing medium
as previously described (See et al., 2004; Feigenson et al.,
2009). After 24 h, cultures were switched to serum-free
growth medium containing Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)
with B27 supplement (1:50 Life technologies), 10 ng/ml basic
fibroblast growth factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
U.S.A.), 2 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (R & D), and 1
ng/ml neurotrophin-3 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, U.S.A.).
Rat cultures were purified 6­8 days after plating by
immunopanning as previously described (Grinspan et al.,
K. Feigenson and others

2000). Cells were successively seeded on to two sets of dishes
coated with Ran-2 antibody to bind type-1 astrocytes,
meningeal cells and microglia. Cells were then put on dishes
plated with A2B5 antibody (undiluted, hybridoma supernat-
ant, ATCC, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.; Eisenbarth et al., 1979) to
bind the OPCs. When cells reached confluency, they were
sub-cultured in polylysine-coated flasks, 12 mm polylysine-
coated coverslips, 100 mm polylysine-coated Petri dishes or
50 mm polylysine-coated Petri dishes. Cells could be passaged
3­4 times. Cultures were considered purified if they
contained fewer than 5% astrocytes.
To culture mouse OPCs, cells were harvested from the
forebrains of individual animals using the same methods and
media as previously described. Individual mouse brains were
cultured singularly until genotypes were identified by PCR of
tail DNA. At this stage, identically genotyped cultures were
combined. OPCs were purified using a gentle modified
washdown procedure as previously described (Feigenson
et al., 2009). Briefly, 4 ml of Hanks-buffered salt solution
without Mg+ and Ca+ was drawn into a Pasteur pipette, and
then forcefully released on the cell monolayer at an angle.
OPCs would detach, leaving any astrocytes adherent to the
plate. OPCs and the Hanks medium were then drawn up into
the pipette and the procedure could be repeated several times
until enough cells were collected. The detached OPCs were
collected in Hanks medium, triturated several times with the
Pasteur pipette and centrifuged at 100 g for 5 min. The pellet
was then plated on to a polylysine-coated flask. Cultures were
considered purified if they contained fewer than 5%
astrocytes.
When OPCs were differentiated into mature OLs, growth
medium was removed, and cell cultures were fed with
DM (differentiation medium), consisting of 50% DMEM
(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and 50% Ham's F12,
with 50 mg/ml transferrin, 5 mg/ml putresine, 3 ng/ml
progesterone, 2.5 ng/ml selenium, 12.5 mg/ml insulin, 0.4
mg/ml T4, 0.3% glucose, 2 mM glutamine and 10 ng/ml biotin.
Cells were allowed to differentiate for 3 days to examine
markers of immature OLs or 5 days to look at markers of
mature OLs. Treatment conditions involved the application of
signalling factors to some cultures; these were 50 ng/ml
Wnt3a (R & D), 50 or 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R & D), 100 ng/ml Dkk-
1 (Dikkopf-1) (R & D) and 500 ng/ml Noggin (R & D).
Immunofluorescence
Immunostaining and preparation of coverslip-plated cells were
performed as previously described (Grinspan and Franceschini,
1995; Feigenson et al., 2009). Antibody pairs used to detect
surface antibodies were anti-A2B5 with goat anti-mouse IgM
and anti-galactocerebroside (RmAb GalC, undiluted, hybri-
doma supernatant; Ranscht et al., 1982) with goat-anti-mouse
IgG3. The antibody pairs used to detect internal antibodies
were GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and Olig2. Anti-GFAP
(undiluted, hybridoma supernatant, gift of Dr Virginia Lee,
University of Pennsylvania) was paired with goat anti-rat IgG.
To label Olig2 (1:500, Millipore, paired with goat anti-rabbit
IgG), cells were blocked for 10 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 after
fixing with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. To label TCF4 (TCF7L2,
1:100, Millipore, paired with goat anti-mouse IgG; Ye et al.,
2009), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked
for 30 min in block containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% BSA and
20% FCS (fetal calf serum). For all cell counts, positively
labelled cells and DAPI+ (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) cells
were counted in ten fields in each of two coverslips from each
of at least three separate in vitro preparations, using a Leica
DM6000B fluorescence microscope at 663 magnification.
Approx. 3000 cells were counted per experimental data point
(1000 cells per condition per n).
Western-blot analysis
Rat cells were collected for Western-blot analysis as
previously described (Feigenson et al., 2009). Cells were
treated with 50 ng/ml BMP4 or Wnt3a and collected after 30
min, 3 or 48 h. Membranes were incubated with BMP4
antibody (1:500, R & D), HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-
conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:1000), or
with Phosphorylated-Smad (1:3000, Cell Signaling) followed
by HRP-conjugated anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (1:1000)
and imaged using ECLH reagents (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ,
U.S.A.) and hyperfilm (Amersham). Blots were stripped and
reprobed with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase; 1:2,500, Chemicon International) as a loading
control for protein quantification. Secondary antibodies were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories.
Generation of mutant mice
The Bmpr1 DKO (BMPR1 double-knockout) mice were
generated as previously described (Wine-Lee et al., 2004;
See et al., 2007). Lines include a classical BMPr1a KO (Mishina
et al., 1995), a BMPR1a conditional KO mouse (Ahn et al.,
2001; Mishina et al., 2002), a BMPR1b classical KO mouse
(gift from Dr Karen Lyons, UCLA; Yi et al., 2000) and a Bcre-32
transgenic mouse. The generation of these mice has been
previously described (Wine-Lee et al., 2004; See et al., 2007).
Normal littermates have one functional allele of both BMPR1
receptors and do not exhibit any phenotype. All mice were
killed at P1 and OPC cultures were successfully harvested. b-
Cat-null (b-catenin loss-of-function mutant) mice were
made available by crossing b-cateninfloxedexon326/floxedexon326
mice (made available by Dr Walter Birchmeier, Max Delbruck
Centrum, Germany) with Cnp-Cre mice, obtained from
Dr Klaus Nave, Max Planck Institute, Germany. Generation
of b-cateninfloxedexon326/floxedexon326 mice has been described
previously (Huelsken et al., 2001), as has the generation of Cnp-
Cre mice (Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003). Offspring were established
by mating b-cateninfloxedexon326/floxedexon326; +/+ mice with
b-cateninfloxedexon326/+; CNP/+ mice. b-catenin loss of func-
tion mice had the genotype b-cateninfloxedexon326/floxedexon326;
CNP/+.

Real-time PCR
OPC cultures were grown on 50 mm dishes and harvested at
6 or 48 h post-treatment with 50 ng/ml Wnt3a or 50 ng/ml
BMP4, with or without 500 ng/ml Noggin. Cells were
extracted with TRIzolH (Molecular Research Center,
Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.). cDNA was reverse transcribed from
2 to 5 mg RNA per treatment group using Superscript III First
Strand Synthesis Kit for RT­PCR (reverse transcription­PCR;
Invitrogen no. 18080044). Primers used were GAPDH, MBP
and ID2 (IDT Technologies). QPCR was performed using SYBR
Green (Applied Biosystems) with the MXPro 3000P.
Quantification was determined using the SYBR Green with
the Dissociation Curve method, as per the protocol of the
manufacturer. Threshold values of fluorescence, Ct
values,
were calculated at least three times per cycle, and values re-
lative to control conditions were used to determine treatment
differences. Samples were measured in triplicate for each
experiment.
Image acquisition
All images were acquired using a Leica DM6000B fluorescence
microscope. All images were mounted using Vectashield
(Vector). Images were acquired with a Leica DFC360 Fx
camera, using Leica Application Suite 2.1.0 software. Images
were evenly enhanced using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe
Systems, Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.).
RESULTS
Wnt and BMP inhibit OL differentiation
To observe the effects of Wnt and BMP on OL development in
vitro, we established primary cultures of OPCs from mouse or
rat brain and purified them to remove astrocytes and other
non-OL lineage cells. Cells were grown to confluency on
coverslips or dishes, subsequently growth factors were
removed and DM was added with or without BMP4 (50 ng/
ml) or Wnt3a (50 ng/ml). We selected BMP4 because, of all
the BMP signalling effectors, it is the most intimately
involved and most abundant during OL development (Ara et
al., 2008). We chose 50 ng/ml BMP4 because it had the
maximal effect in our previous studies (Grinspan et al., 2000;
See et al., 2004). We selected Wnt3a as an effector of
canonical Wnt signalling based on its location in developing
dorsal spinal cord and its effects on OPCs from previous
studies (Shimizu et al., 2005; Feigenson et al., 2009). A
dose2response curve showed that 50 ng/ml Wnt3a most
effectively inhibited OPCs from differentiating (K. Feigenson
and J.B. Grinspan, results not shown). After 3 days in DM, the
treated samples were processed for IHC (immunohistochem-
istry), and labelled with antibodies directed against GalC, a
marker of early differentiation, and A2B5, which labels OPCs.
In control conditions, 26% of rat cells expressed GalC, and
67% were labelled with A2B5, as observed in previous studies
(Feigenson et al., 2009). The overlap in labelling between
A2B5 and GalC is temporary and the A2B5 labelling will
slowly disappear as the OLs mature (Crang et al., 2004;
Feigenson et al., 2009). In contrast, GalC labelling was almost
completely absent in BMP4 treatment conditions, while
A2B5 labelling was unchanged. Wnt3a treatment reduced
GalC labelling by 33% (P,0.05), in keeping with the 30­40%
decrease we have observed previously, and also did not
significantly affect the amount of cells being labelled with
A2B5 or alter their morphology (Figures 1A and 1C).
To observe the effects of BMP4 and Wnt3a on the number
of astrocytes in culture, we also immunolabelled cells with
antibodies directed against GFAP. Control cultures and
cultures treated with Wnt3a contained fewer than 5%
astrocytes, while in BMP4-treated cultures the number
of astrocytes increased 6.5-fold (P,0.05, Figures 1B and
1D). We have previously shown that neither signalling factor
had any significant impact on the amount of cells undergoing
apoptosis, proliferation or differentiation into neurons
(Grinspan et al., 2000; Feigenson et al., 2009). These results
indicate that BMP4 can completely inhibit OPC differenti-
ation and induce astrogliogenesis, while Wnt3a can partially
inhibit OPC differentiation without having an impact on
astrocyte cell fate.
A BMP inhibitor blocks the effects of both BMP4
and Wnt3a signalling but a Wnt inhibitor blocks
only Wnt3a signalling
To determine whether there is a relationship between the
Wnt and BMP signalling pathways, pharmacological inhibi-
tors of canonical Wnt signalling were added concurrently
with BMP4 and pharmacological inhibitors of BMP signalling
were added concurrently with Wnt3a. Noggin (500 ng/ml), an
inhibitor of canonical BMP signalling, was added to confluent
cell cultures along with DM, 50 ng/ml BMP4 or 50 ng/ml
Wnt3a. Noggin treatment alone did not alter the number of
GalC+ cells relative to control conditions (Figure 2A).
Although OPCs secrete both BMP and noggin, the secreted
noggin normally limits the endogenous effects of BMP
(Kondo and Raff, 2004). Noggin added with BMP4 completely
blocked the effect of BMP4 and the number of GalC+ cells
was not significantly different from the untreated control
condition (Figure 2A). Similarly, when noggin was added
along with Wnt3a, the number of GalC+ cells was the same as
in the untreated control condition, indicating that blocking
the BMP signalling pathway blocks the inhibitory actions of
BMP4 and Wnt3a on OPC differentiation in vitro (Figure 2A).
To determine whether blocking the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway could block BMP signalling, we treated
OPC cultures with Dkk-1, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt
signalling. Dkk-1 treatment (100 ng/ml) alone did not alter
the number of GalC+ cells relative to control conditions.
When used concurrently with Wnt3a, however, Dkk-1 blocked

Figure 1 BMP4 and Wnt3a treatment inhibit OL differentiation
Cultures of rat OPCs were grown to confluence, switched to DM, alone or with BMP4 or Wnt3a, and then immunostained for GalC,
GFAP and A2B5. (A) After 3 days in DM, many control OPCs expressed GalC and A2B5. BMP4-treated OPCs expressed A2B5 at
comparable levels to controls conditions, but almost no cells expressed GalC (P,0.01). Wnt3a-treated cells had comparable levels of
A2B5 expressing cells relative to control conditions, but a 33% reduction in the number of cells expressing GalC (P,0.05).
(B) Control cultures had occasional labelling of GFAP+ cells, whereas 6.5 times as many cells in the BMP4 treatment condition were
positively labelled with GFAP antibody (P,0.01). Wnt3a treatment did not noticeably change the number of GFAP+ cells relative to
control conditions. (C, D) Bar graphs quantify the number of cells labelled with specific antibodies, measured relative to control
conditions, n59. Images shown were taken at 620 magnification.

the inhibitory effect of Wnt3a. In contrast, BMP4 completely
inhibited GalC expression in cells even when treated
concurrently with Dkk-1 (Figure 2B), indicating that blocking
the canonical Wnt signalling pathway does not block the
BMP signalling pathway in vitro. These results suggest that
BMP4 does not signal upstream of the canonical Wnt
pathway, and that the BMP pathway is not dependent on
the Wnt signalling pathway.
Genetic ablation of the BMP signalling pathway
blocks the effects of BMP4 and Wnt3a
We next used a genetic model to help determine the
relationship between BMP4 and Wnt3a and confirm our
pharmacological results. We obtained Bmpr1 DKO mice in
which both BMPR1A and BMPR1B have been functionally
inactivated in the neural tube by E10.5 using the Bcre-32
transgenic allele. These mice have been characterized
previously (Wine-Lee et al., 2004; See et al., 2007). OPCs
cultured from the animals are able to differentiate, do not
translocate Smad (a downstream effector of BMP signalling)
to the nucleus, and do not respond to BMP treatment
(See et al., 2007). We generated cultures from these DKO
(double-knockout) animals as well as from single KOs
(knockouts; Bmpr1b KO, Bmpr1a KO) and normal littermates.
We then treated these cultures with DM alone or DM
containing BMP4 or Wnt3a.
BMP4 completely eliminated GalC expression in normal
mouse OPC cultures after 3 days in DM, and Wnt3a reduced
the number of GalC+ cells by 41%. The number of A2B5+
cells did not vary from control conditions, replicating our
previous findings in control cultures. These results were
further replicated in OPC cultures from Bmpr1a KO and
Bmpr1b KO mice (Figure 3A). In the Bmpr1 DKO OPC cultures
that were untreated or treated with BMP4, the cells
differentiated to the extent of the normal cells, as we have
previously shown (See et al., 2007). This indicates that the
OPCs from animals without BMP signalling are able to
differentiate normally but do not respond to BMP4. Similarly,
when the Bmpr1 DKO OPC cultures were treated with Wnt3a,
the number of GalC+ cells was not significantly different
Figure 2 Pharmacological inhibition of the BMP pathway blocks the
effects of Wnt3a and BMP4 on OL differentiation
OPC cultures were placed in DM for 3 days, alone or with BMP4 or Wnt3.
Noggin or DKK-1 was added to similarly treated cells. (A) BMP4 treatment
eliminated GalC expression (P,0.01), but the addition of noggin concurrently
with BMP4 rescued this effect. Similarly, Wnt3a treatment reduced the
number of GalC+ cells by 39% relative to controls (P,0.05), but concurrent
noggin treatment rescued this effect (n57). (B) Dkk-1 addition abrogated the
effect of Wnt3a on the number of GalC+ cells (P,0.01), and did not alter the
BMP4 mediated elimination of GalC expressing cells (P,0.05, n53).
Figure 3 OPCs from mice lacking the BMP type I receptor do not respond
to BMP4 or Wnt3a treatment
OPC cultures were generated from Bmpr1 DKO, Bmpr1a KO, Bmpr1b KO, and
normal mice, grown, and placed in DM. (A) Three days after DM treatment,
OPCs from all three types of mutant mice exhibited similar numbers of GalC+
cells relative to controls. BMP4 treatment almost completely eliminated
GalC+ cells in Bmpr1a KO, Bmpr1b KO, and normal mouse OPCs (P,0.01), but
not in OPC cultures from Bmpr1 DKO mice. Similarly, Wnt3a expression
decreased GalC+ cells in cultures from Bmpr1a KO, Bmpr1b KO and normal
mice (P,0.05), but not in those from Bmpr1 DKO mice. (B) OPC cultures
generated from b-Cat-null mice and normal littermates were treated with
BMP4 or Wnt3a. BMP4 almost completely reduced the number of GalC+ cells in
both types of cultures (P,0.01). Wnt3a reduced the number of GalC+ cells by
57% in control cultures, but this effect was not observed in the mutant
cultures (P,0.05, n53).

from control conditions or Bmpr1 DKO cells treated with
BMP4 (Figure 3A). These results indicate that when the BMP
signalling pathway is completely abrogated, the canonical
Wnt signalling pathway is similarly prevented from exerting
an inhibitory effect on OPC differentiation. Further, when
either Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b is individually deleted, the other
type I receptor can compensate to maintain the integrity of
the BMP signalling pathway and allow it to influence OL
development. Our combined pharmacological and genetic
results suggest that we can successfully block the effects of
Wnt3a on OL differentiation by abrogating the BMP
signalling pathway via two independent methods.
Genetic inhibition of the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway blocks the effect of Wnt3a,
but not that of BMP4, on OL differentiation
To observe the effectiveness of canonical Wnt signalling and
canonical BMP signalling on OL development when the Wnt
signalling pathway has been effectively eliminated, we
employed mutant mice with a conditional KO of the nuclear
effector of canonical Wnt signalling, b-catenin [b-Cat-null
(b-catenin loss of function mutant mice)]. Mice expressing a
CNP-Cre transgene have been described previously (Lappe-
Siefke et al., 2003; Feigenson et al., 2009). These mice are
bred to a line of mice containing floxed sites surrounding
exons 3­6 on the b-catenin gene (Huelsken et al., 2001).
Upon Cre-mediated recombination, these exons are excised
from the transcribed product and no functional b-catenin
protein is produced. Wnt signalling is normally activated
when b-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it can
activate TCF (T-cell factor)/LEF-1 (lymphoid enhancer factor-
1) transcription factors. In these mutant mice, the Wnt
signalling pathway is inhibited in all cells of OL lineage by
preventing active b-catenin from being produced.
Mice were viable at P1 and OPC cultures were generated
from mutants and normal littermates as previously described.
Cultures were treated with DM with or without BMP4 or
Wnt3a. Treatment with Wnt3a did not change the number of
GalC+ cells relative to DM in the b-Cat-null OPC cultures,
indicating that canonical Wnt signalling was effectively
eliminated from OPCs (Figure 3B). In contrast, BMP4
completely eliminated the expression of GalC in treated cells.
These results indicate that blocking the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway prevents the inhibitory effect of Wnt3a
on OL development, but not that of BMP4, and that the BMP
signalling pathway is not upstream of the Wnt signalling
pathway or dependent on the Wnt signalling pathway in this
system.
Wnt3a does not up-regulate the canonical BMP
signalling pathway
To identify if Wnt signalling directly increases the BMP
ligand, we treated cultured OPC cultures with Wnt3a and
looked for changes in BMP4 protein by Western-blot analysis.
Wnt3a treatment did not result in an increase in BMP4
protein after 30 min or 3 h, when compared with untreated
conditions or BMP4-positive control conditions (Figure 4A).
Later time points at 2 and 5 days post-treatment also showed
no sign of BMP4 up-regulation (results not shown). To see if
Wnt3a could up-regulate the canonical BMP signalling
pathway independently from increasing the amount of BMP
ligand, we treated cultured OPCs with BMP4 and Wnt3a and
looked for increases of phosphorylated-Smad 1/5/8. When
cultures were treated with BMP4, there were clear increases
in phosphorylated-Smad levels observed by Western blots by
30 min post-treatment (Figure 4B). In contrast, Wnt3a did
not noticeably increase Smad levels after the same amount of
time. Longer time points, up to 48 h, also did not show
increased levels of phosphorylated-Smad (results not shown).
These results indicate that Wnt3a does not directly up-
regulate canonical BMP signalling.
BMP4 and Wnt3a do not decrease OPC
differentiation in a combinatorial manner
To determine whether the effects of BMP4 and Wnt3a were
additive, we simultaneously treated OPCs with DM containing
50 ng/ml Wnt3a and 10 ng/ml BMP4, both of which
separately reduce the number of GalC+ cells by approx.
40% relative to control conditions. We also treated cells with
each growth factor individually and with 50 ng/ml BMP4 as a
Figure 4 Wnt3a does not directly up-regulate the canonical BMP
signalling pathway
Rat cells were treated with Wnt3a or BMP4, cells were harvested for protein
at 30 min and 3 h post treatment, and Western blots were performed. (A) At
both time points, BMP4 bands are visible in the positive control conditions, as
compared with untreated and Wnt3a-treated conditions. (B) At both time
points, phosphorylated-Smad bands are visible in BMP4-treated conditions
but not in untreated or Wnt3a-treated conditions. GAPDH was used as a
loading control for both analyses.

positive control. If BMP and Wnt signalling reduce the
percentage of GalC+ cells independently, we could expect to
see additional decreases in the number of mature OLs with
combined treatment. There were no significant decreases in
GalC expression, however, in the combined treatment
condition when compared with conditions when either 10
ng/ml BMP4 or 50 ng/ml Wnt3a were added separately
(Figure 5).
To determine what could restrict the effect of Wnt3a to a
subset of cells, we labelled OPC cultures with antibody to
TCF4, the downstream transcriptional effector of canonical
Wnt signalling. Nuclear TCF4 labelling was observed in 46.7%
of cultured OPCs (Figure 6), suggesting that it is the nuclear
expression of TCF4 that facilitates the effects of Wnt3a on OL
differentiation. Taken together, these results are consistent
with the interpretation that the same downstream pathway
is used by both signalling factors to inhibit OL maturation.
It is also consistent with our data that Wnt only affects a
subset of TCF4 expressing cells that are targeted in parallel by
BMP4.
Wnt3a and BMP4 increase expression of Id2
mRNA
We used QPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) to determine
what downstream effectors are influenced by both Wnt and
BMP treatment. OPC cultures were obtained from normal rats
as previously described. Cells were grown on 50 mm dishes
and treated with Wnt3a or BMP4 for 6 and 48 h. We observed
a decrease in Mbp transcripts at 48 h after treatment with
Wnt3a and BMP4, mirroring our IHC results (Figure 7A).
When assaying for Id2 mRNA, however, both Wnt3a and
BMP4 significantly increased transcript levels (Figure 7B). IDs
(inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins) are known inhibitors of
differentiation, and previous studies have revealed that they
are targets of BMP and Wnt signalling (Samanta and Kessler,
2004; Ye et al., 2009). These results indicate that Wnt3a and
BMP4 can target the same effectors of OL differentiation.
Wnt3a and BMP4 reduce levels of nuclear Olig2
in OPCs
ID2 prevents the nuclear localization of Olig2 after
stimulation with BMP4, thus inhibiting BMP signalling
(Samanta and Kessler, 2004). We used IHC to examine the
localization of Olig2 after treatment with either BMP4 or
Wnt3a. After 2 days of treatment, we observed a significant
decrease in the total number of cells in which Olig2 was
clearly visible co-localized with cell nuclei in both BMP4- and
Wnt3a-treated cultures. There was a 55% reduction in Olig2
and DAPI co-labelling in BMP4-treated cultures and a 19%
reduction in Wnt3a-treated cultures relative to controls
(Figures 8A and 8B). These results further indicate that
BMP4 and Wnt3a are targeting common factors in OPC
differentiation.
Figure 5 Collective treatment with BMP4 and Wnt3a does not inhibit
precursor differentiation greater than individual treatment with BMP4 or
Wnt3a
Rat OPCs were cultured and then placed in DM with 50 ng/ml BMP4, 10 ng/ml
BMP4, 50 ng/ml Wnt3a or 50 ng/ml Wnt3a and 10 ng/ml BMP4. After 3
days, 50 ng/ml BMP4 decreased GalC+ cells by 92% relative to control
conditions (P,0.05), 10 ng/ml BMP4 decreased OPC differentiation by 35%
(P,0.05), 50 ng/ml Wnt3a decreased OPC differentiation by 38% (P,0.05) and
50 ng/ml Wnt3a combined with 10 ng/ml BMP4 decreased OPC differentiation
by 44% (P,0.05). The difference between the combined addition of BMP4 and
Wnt3a was not significantly different from the application of either treatment
factor individually (n53).

DISCUSSION
We have analysed the relationship between canonical Wnt and
BMP signalling in OL development, and our results indicate
that both pathways rely on a fully functional BMP signalling
pathway. In primary rodent OPC cultures, BMP4 by itself
almost completely eliminates OPC differentiation and signifi-
cantly increases the number of astrocytes. Wnt3a by itself
decreases OPC differentiation by 30­40% without a corres-
ponding increase in astrocyte generation. Blocking the BMP
signalling pathway with pharmacological or genetic tech-
niques at different points on the BMP pathway prevents the
effects of both BMP4 and Wnt3a. In contrast, blocking the ca-
nonical Wnt signalling pathway was able to counter the effect
of Wnt3a on OPC differentiation, but not that of BMP4.
To address why Wnt3a only partially inhibits OL differ-
entiation, in comparison with the complete inhibitory activity
of BMP4, we examined downstream expression of Wnt
effectors. We observed that 46.7% of OPCs in culture express
TCF4, which corresponds to the decrease in differentiation
after Wnt3a treatment. This suggests two possibilities: TCF4
is expressed only in a subset of OPCs or TCF4 is only
transiently expressed in all OPCs and 46.7% of these cells
expressed TCF4 at the time of treatment. Both possibilities
indicate that the nuclear expression of TCF4 appears to
control the ability of Wnt3a to affect OL differentiation. This
is consistent with the conclusions drawn by Fancy et al.
(2009) concerning TCF4 expression in vivo.
To find at what level BMP4 and Wnt3a may be inhibiting
OPC differentiation, we performed QPCR and assayed for Id2
transcript levels. Both BMP4 and Wnt3a consistently re-
duced transcript levels of Mbp, complementing our IHC
results, and also increased levels of Id2, in keeping with earlier
studies (Samanta and Kessler, 2004; Ye et al., 2009). IDs are
actively involved in preventing OPC differentiation and OL
myelination, largely by preventing nuclear localization of Olig
proteins to keep the timing of differentiation precise and
regulated (Kondo and Raff, 2000; Wang et al., 2001; Samanta
and Kessler, 2004; Gokhan et al., 2005; Marin-Husstege et al.,
2006; Cheng et al., 2007). We found that both Wnt3a and
BMP4 reduced the number of cells co-labelled with Olig2 in
the nucleus, indicating that both factors were actively
preventing the nuclear activity and differentiating capabil-
ities of Olig2, possibly via ID2 induction. There was a larger
effect of BMP4 treatment on both Olig2 and ID2 treatment
when compared with Wnt3a treatment, consistent with our
differentiation results.
The BMP and Wnt pathways have many contextually and
temporally dependent interactions throughout development
(Itasaki and Hoppler, 2010). In the developing spinal cord,
overexpression of either signalling factor alone induces a dor-
salized phenotype, whereas their removal produces ventralized
phenotypes, indicating that both signals may have func-
tionally similar, interacting or redundant effects (Nguyen et al.,
2000; Muroyama et al., 2002; Timmer et al., 2002; Zechner
et al., 2007; Alvarez-Medina et al., 2008). In some developmental
systems, the BMP pathway up-regulates or acts upstream of
Wnt signalling, such as in neural crest delamination (Burstyn-
Cohen et al., 2004), keratinocyte development (Yang et al., 2006)
and dorsal/ventral patterning (Zechner et al., 2007). Conversely,
Figure 7 BMP4 and Wnt3a regulate Id2 and Mbp transcript levels
Rat OPCs were cultured and treated with Wnt3a or BMP4 and assayed for
QPCR. (A) After treatment for 48 h, levels of Mbp mRNA were calculated
compared with untreated control OPCs. DM-treated cells had a 7-fold
increase in Mbp expression over that of untreated cells and BMP4-treated
cells (P,0.05). This expression was also 2.33-fold more than that of Wnt3a-
treated cells (P,0.05, n54). (B) After treatment for 6 h, levels of Id2 mRNA
were calculated compared with untreated control OPCs. BMP4 and Wnt3a
treatment increased Id2 transcript expression 4.7- and 2.2-fold, respectively
(P,0.05, n57).

Mouse OPCs were cultured, placed in DM, and treated with Wnt3a or BMP4.
(A) Two days after treatment, cells were labelled for Olig2 and A2B5. (B) Bar
graphs quantify the number of Olig2+ cells in each condition relative to
control. BMP4 decreased the number of nuclei co-labelled with Olig2 by 55%
(P,0.01, n55). Wnt3a decreased the number of nuclei co-labelled with Olig2
by 19% (P,0.05, n55). Images shown were taken at 640 magnification.

Wnt signalling can act upstream or up-regulate the BMP
pathway, such as during neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis
(Kasai et al., 2005), limb mesenchyme development (Hill et al.,
2006) and tooth development (Liu et al., 2008a). The down-
stream effectors of both signalling pathways can also interact in
synergistic manners to regulate transcription (Labbe et al., 2000;
Nishita et al., 2000; Letamendia et al., 2001; Theil et al., 2002;
Hussein et al., 2003), and canonical Wnt signalling can prolong
the activity of the BMP pathway (Fuentealba et al., 2007). In
other contexts, Wnt and BMP signalling can be directly
antagonistic, such as in neuroepithelial cell development
(Ille et al., 2007), aspects of neural development (Gomez-
Skarmeta et al., 2001), muscle positioning (Bonafede et al., 2006)
and osteoblast development (Kamiya et al., 2008a, 2008b;
Honda et al., 2010). In some systems, such as during aspects of
limb bud and apical ectodermal ridge formation, the BMP and
Wnt pathways can complexly regulate each other through
parallel signalling and feedback systems (Soshnikova et al., 2003;
Villacorte et al., 2010).
Our results clearly demonstrate that the BMP pathway is
essential for the Wnt pathway to inhibit OPC differentiation,
as eliminating BMP signalling effectively blocks the effects of
Wnt3a. This is not just a result of the BMP antagonist
simultaneously blocking Wnt signalling, because genetic
removal of BMP receptors also prevented Wnt3a from
inhibiting differentiation.
There are three potential mechanisms through which the
BMP and Wnt pathways could interact. The most direct
identifiable interaction would be through the canonical Wnt
signalling pathway up-regulating phosphorylated-Smad, the
major effector of canonical BMP signalling. However, we did
not detect increases in phosphorylated-Smad levels on Wnt3a
treatment, although we were able to consistently detect
phosphorylated-Smad increases after standard BMP4 treat-
ment. It is possible that Wnt signalling may directly activate
the BMP signalling pathway at levels below detection in
Smad assays. We also did not detect up-regulation of BMP
protein after Wnt3a treatment using Western-blot analysis.
The second interaction could involve activation of non-
canonical BMP pathways, including kinase mTOR (mammalian
target of rapamycin)/FRAP via STAT3 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription), activated mitogen kinases and LIM
kinase (Chen and Panchision, 2007 for review). In other
systems, such as multipotent neural precursor cells, BMP4
activates both canonical and non-canonical pathways for
separate effects (Rajan et al., 2003). It is possible that Wnts
and BMPs interact through one of the non-canonical routes.
The possibility of signalling through multiple, alternative
pathways could also explain why both BMP4 and Wnt3a
treatment inhibit OPC differentiation and maintain similar
levels of A2B5+ cells, despite only BMP4 directly increasing
the number of astrocytes.
Finally, If Wnt signalling does not up-regulate BMP signalling,
downstream mechanisms could be evoked. Some common
transcriptional targets of both pathways have Smad and TCF/
LEF-binding sites in close proximity, indicating that the two
pathways have synergistic activity among their downstream
effectors, including Emx2 (Theil et al., 2002), Msx2 (Willert et al.,
2002; Hussein et al., 2003), c-myc (Hu and Rosenblum, 2005)
and Xtwin (Labbe et al., 2000; Nishita et al., 2000; Letamendia
et al., 2001). The BMP and Wnt signalling pathways may also
interact during epigenetic regulation of OL differentiation.
Recent studies have shown that HDACs (histone deacetylases)
compete with activated b-catenin to bind with TCF4. Bound to
b-catenin, TCF4 acts as a transcriptional repressor of OL
differentiation by up-regulating factors such as ID2/4. Bound
to HDACs, TCF4 acts as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting the
activity of ID2/4 and up-regulating myelin-promoting genes
such as Mbp (Marin-Husstege et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2005; He
et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2009). Our experiments indicate that
canonical Wnt signalling depends on the BMP pathway to
inhibit OL development; it is possible that the TCF transcriptional
complex requires inherent Smad elements or other downstream
effectors of BMP signalling to interact with IDs or other
inhibitory elements. The transcriptional activity of the Wnt
signalling pathway may then rely on endogenous BMP func-
tioning, and will therefore be inhibited when BMP signalling is
abrogated.
Understanding what signals regulate the timing mechanisms
of OL maturation will facilitate the development of therapies for
myelin disorders. BMP up-regulation has been well documented
in many types of CNS disease and demyelinating paradigms (See
and Grinspan, 2009). Furthermore, several recent studies
demonstrate that Wnt signalling is active during white matter
injury as well, including aspects of axonal regeneration (Liu
et al., 2008b; Miyashita et al., 2009), NG2+ cell proliferation
(Orre et al., 2009; White et al., 2010) and remyelination (Fancy
et al., 2009). BMPs and Wnts interact in many intricate ways
during development, and it is likely that they have similar
interactions during CNS injury and recovery. It is, therefore,
important to understand how these pathways function inde-
pendently and in relationship to one another. We have shown
that the BMP pathway is a competence factor for canonical Wnt
signalling to inhibit OPC differentiation in cell culture
paradigms. Further experiments should investigate this inter-
action during remyelination events and in CNS injury models.
