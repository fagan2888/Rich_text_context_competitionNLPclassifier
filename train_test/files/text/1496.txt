Hypertension is a well established independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although substantial mortal-
ity from the long-term sequelae of hypertension can be pre-
vented through existing antihypertensive drug therapy and
blood pressure (BP) control, almost 22% of US adults are still
unaware of their hypertension, and 32% of the hypertensive
population are not on treatment.1 As mortality from hyper-
tension has increased over the past 10 years, and >70 million
Americans are living with hypertension currently,2 it is of great
interest to examine the relationship between hypertension
treatment and control with cardiovascular outcomes and total
mortality in the general hypertensive population.
A number of effective antihypertensive drugs, including
diuretics, -blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor
blockers are currently available for hypertension therapy.3
Meta-analyses of the multiple randomized clinical trials have
shown that lowering BP by any drugs compared with placebo
reduces CVD morbidity and mortality; all classes of drugs
reduce total and CVD mortality equally; and different classes
of drugs provide differing degrees of protection from CVD
morbidities.4­7 However morbidity and mortality trials have
been the target of growing dissatisfaction and criticism in the
past few years.8,9 Because most trials have been carried out on
selected groups of high-risk hypertensive patients with obvi-
ous differences in their cardiovascular risk profile as opposed
to the general hypertensive population, the documented effects
of hypertension treatment and control in a particular clinical
trial may have less general validity than what is often assumed.
Thus, population-based observational studies offer an alterna-
tive approach to evaluate outcomes in hypertension treatment
and control.
In the present study, we use the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and mortality
follow-up through 2006 to examine the association of hyper-
tension treatment and control status with health outcomes in

Association of Hypertension Treatment and Control
With All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality
Among US Adults With Hypertension
Qiuping Gu1, Charles F. Dillon1,Vicki L. Burt1 and Richard F. Gillum1
Background
Clinical trials have provided convincing evidence that blood pressure
(BP) lowering treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) and total mortality.The objective of this study was to examine
the association of hypertension treatment, control, and BP indexes
with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among US adults with
hypertension.
Methods
Persons aged 18 years from theThird National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) were identified as hypertensives
based on a BP 140/90mmHg or current treatment for hypertension.
Vital status in 2006 was ascertained by passive follow-up using the
National Death Index. Cox regression models were used to assess
correlates of survival.
Results
At baseline, 52% of hypertensive adults reported currently taking
prescription medicine for high BP and 38% of treated persons had BP
controlled. Compared to treated controlled hypertensives, treated
uncontrolled hypertensives had a 1.57-fold (95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.28­1.91) and 1.74-fold (95% CI 1.36­2.22) risk of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality; untreated hypertensives had a 1.34-fold
(95% CI 1.12­1.62) and 1.37-fold (95% CI 1.04­1.81) risk of all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.The association persisted
after further excluding persons with pre-existing hypertension
comorbidities. Mortality risk was linearly increased with systolic BP
(SBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MBP), whereas
diastolic BP (DBP) was not a significant predictor of cardiovascular
mortality overall. No significant associations were observed between
drug classes and mortality risk.
Conclusions
This study indicates that uncontrolled and untreated hypertension
was associated with increased risk of total and cardiovascular
mortality among the general hypertensive population.

terms of all-cause and CVD mortality among US adults with
hypertension. We also evaluate the relationship of systolic BP
(SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial
pressure (MBP), and specific antihypertensive treatment regi-
mens with the risk of total and CVD mortality.
Methods
Study design and subjects. The NHANES III was a nation-
ally representative health survey conducted between1988 and
1994. The survey used a multistage, stratified probability clus-
ter design to select a representative sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population. Detailed descriptions of the
survey plan, sampling, operation, response, and analytic guide-
lines have been specified elsewhere.10 The NHANES III proto-
col was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics
institutional review board and written informed consent for
data collection was obtained from all survey participants.
The personal interviews and physical examination of
NHANES III participants provided baseline data for this study.
The NHANES III­linked mortality file through 2006 was
created to permit longitudinal study of NHANES III partici-
pants. Mortality status was based on the result of a probabil-
istic matching between NHANES III participants and the US
National Death Index. Details about the probabilistic match-
ing methodology are available elsewhere.11
The overall NHANES III response rate for the interview
and health examination was 78%. Among 17,250 participants
(18 years) who had BP measurements, 5,128 hypertensive per-
sons were identified on the basis of a mean SBP 140mmHg,
or a mean DBP 90mmHg, or self-reported current use of a
prescribed medicine for high BP. After further exclusion of
pregnant women, and those missing data on prescription med-
ication, loss to follow-up, or lack of information on cause of
death, a total of 5,086 hypertensive subjects remained available
to form the final analytical sample.
Measurements. BP was measured with participants aged 5 years
in the sitting position after 5 min of rest by a trained health inter-
viewer at home and by a physician at the mobile examination
center. Appropriate cuff sizes were used for participants based on
manufacturer's recommendations. A mean SBP and a mean DBP
for each individual from up to six measurements (three on each
occasion) were used to define hypertension and classify BP cat-
egories. PP was calculated as the difference between a mean SBP
and a mean DBP. MAP was calculated as a mean DBP plus one-
third of PP value. BP indexes were expressed as each 10mmHg
increment in SBP, PP, and MAP, or each 5mmHg increment in
DBP. Based on BP questionnaire and BP examination data, we
further defined three hypertension categories. Treated control-
led hypertensives were subjects who reported currently taking
prescribed medicine for hypertension and had SBP <140mmHg
and DBP <90mmHg (SBP <130mmHg and DBP <80mmHg if
diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) coexisted3). Treated
uncontrolled hypertensives were subjects who reported cur-
rently taking prescribed medicine for hypertension and had SBP
140mmHg or DBP 90mmHg (SBP 130mmHg or DBP
80mmHg if diabetes or CKD coexisted). The remaining hyper-
tensive persons were classified as untreated hypertensives.
Detailed prescription medication use information was col-
lected through the household interview. Antihypertensive
agents reported by survey participants were identified and
grouped into five drug classes including diuretics, -blockers,
calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, and other antihypertensive agents (
1
-blockers,
central 
2
agonists, direct vasodilators, and other centrally
acting drugs).3 Angiotensin receptor blockers were not avail-
able before the 1995. Persons taking an antihypertensive
medication with only one active ingredient were considered
as receiving monotherapy. Those taking more than one active
ingredient (either in one combination pill or in more than one
different single pills) were classified as receiving polytherapy.
The interview questionnaires also provided data on age,
gender, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, leisure time physi-
cal activities, a history of medically diagnosed hypertension,
high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, heart attack, or heart failure.
Height and weight were measured with a standard protocol
and used to compute body mass index (kg/m2). Persons with
a body mass index 30 were classified as obese. Serum choles-
terol, creatinine and urine albumin, and creatinine were meas-
ured according to standard methods.12 Hypercholesterolemia
was defined as serum total cholesterol 240 mg/dl or a self-
report of currently taking a prescription drug for lowering
cholesterol. Serum creatinine values were corrected according
to the recommended guideline.12 Glomerular filtration rate
was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease
equation, 175 × standardized Scr
-1.154 × age-0.203 × 1.210 (if
black) × 0.742 (if female).13 CKD was defined as either an esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate below 60ml/min/1.73m2 or
urinary albumin >200mg/g creatinine.3
We merged NHANES III baseline data with the NHANES
III­linked mortality file through 31 December 2006.
Underlying causes of death were classified according to the
International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, and
codes I00 to I78 were considered as CVD causes of death.14
Persons who survived were administratively censored at 31
December 2006. Persons who died of non-CVD causes were
considered censored at the date of death for CVD mortality
analysis. Follow-up time for each person was calculated as the
difference between the NHANES III examination date and the
last known date alive or censored from the NHANES III mor-
tality study.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (RTI, Research
Triangle Park, NC).15 Sample weights were used to account
for differential probabilities of selection and the complex
sample design and to obtain estimates representative of the
noninstitutionalized US hypertensive population. Variance
estimates were computed using the Taylor series linearization
approximation approach.16 Statistical differences between
hypertension treatment and control status for baseline charac-
teristics of the study cohort were tested univariately at the 0.05

level using a t statistic with a Bonferroni adjustment for three
comparisons ( = 0.05/3). Cox proportional hazard models
were used to assess the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality
associated with hypertension treatment and control status
using treated controlled hypertensives as the reference group
because a previous study indicated that the relative risk of CVD
mortality for treated controlled hypertensives (1.15, 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 0.73­1.82) was not different from those
without hypertension in the US general population.17 Validity
of the proportional hazard assumption for each variable was
assessed by adding to the model a time-dependent corre-
sponding variable.18 As the proportional hazard assumption
was violated across age and gender, we fit models separately
for age and gender in addition to the hypertensive samples.
Examining the interaction of covariates with hypertension
treatment and control categories in predicting all-cause and
CVD death did not indicate any significant modifiers beside
age and diabetes. To eliminate potential bias due to pre-exist-
ing illness, we further fit model by exclusion of hypertensive
individuals with diabetes, CKD, heart attack, heart failure, or
stroke at baseline.
Results
At baseline, 52% of hypertensive persons reported taking
prescribed medicine for hypertension, 38% of treated hyper-
tensives achieved the therapeutic goals, and 77% of untreated
hypertensives were undiagnosed or unaware of their hyperten-
sion (data not shown). Table 1 shows distributions of demo-
graphic characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and BP
levels by hypertension treatment and control status. Compared
with treated controlled hypertensives, treated uncontrolled
hypertensives were older, had higher BP values and higher
prevalence of comorbidities; untreated hypertensives were
more likely to be men and Mexican American, had higher

BP values but lower prevalence of hypercholesterolemia. The
demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, and BP values were
also different between the treated uncontrolled and untreated
hypertensive groups.
During 58,130 person-years of follow-up (mean 11.4 years,
maximum 18.1 years), there were a total of 2,521 deaths from
all causes and 1,223 deaths from CVD, respectively. The
patterns of hazard ratio variations using the fully adjusted
model are similar to those using the partially adjusted model
(Table 2). In the fully adjusted model, relative to treated
controlled hypertension, treated uncontrolled hypertension
was associated with a 57 and 74% increased risk of all-cause
and CVD mortality, and untreated hypertension was associ-
ated with a 34 and 37% increased risk of all-cause and CVD
mortality, respectively. The age and gender stratified analyses
showed similar patterns, whereas the difference in CVD mor-
tality between untreated and treated controlled hypertension
did not reach statistical significant. However, after further
exclusion of those with major comorbidities at baseline (dia-
betes, CKD, heart attack, heart failure, or stroke), untreated
hypertensives had a 71% (95% CI 1.12­2.60) increased
risk of CVD mortality compared with treated controlled
hypertensives.
The individual contributions of SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP in
predicting mortality are shown in Table 3. Both all-cause and
CVD-related mortality risk progressively increased with each
10mmHg increment in SBP, PP, or MAP, in the overall analy-
sis and in most subgroup analyses. These associations per-
sisted even after the exclusion of pre-existing comorbidities.
However, PP was not a significant predictor for the younger
hypertensive population (fully adjusted model), and MAP
was not a significant predictor of all-cause death among men.

DBP was only a significant predictor of all-cause mortality
for the younger hypertensive population and among women.
Considering the joint effect of SBP and DBP, multivariable
adjusted hazard ratios of CVD mortality were 3.83, 2.88,
2.39, and 1.98 for hypertensive subjects with either one of
SBP/DBP values 160/100, 140­159/90­99, 130­139/85­89,
and 120­129/80­84mmHg, respectively, compared to those
with SBP <120mmHg and DBP <80mmHg (Ptrend
< 0.01,
data not shown).
The relationships of different antihypertensive drug classes
with all-cause and CVD mortality are shown in Table 4. In
the partially adjusted model, hypertensive persons receiv-
ing monotherapy with a calcium channel blocker had a

significantly greater risk of all-cause mortality compared
to those receiving monotherapy with a diuretic. However,
the hazard ratio reduced to a nonsignificant 1.14 (95% CI
0.90­1.46) in the fully adjusted model. Among hyperten-
sive persons receiving polytherapy, no statistically signifi-
cant associations were observed between drug classes of any
two-drug combinations and either all-cause or CVD-caused
mortality. Furthermore, exclusion of hypertensive individu-
als with pre-existing illnesses did not show any significant

Discussion
The primary findings from this large, nationally representative,
population-based study indicate that both all-cause mortality
and mortality from CVD were associated with hypertension
treatment and control status. Specifically, relative to treated
controlled hypertensives, treated uncontrolled hypertensives
had a 57 and 74% greater risk of all-cause and CVD mortality
and untreated hypertensives had a 34 and 37% greater risk of
all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively. The association per-
sisted and was significant after excluding subjects with hyper-
tension comorbidities at baseline.
Large randomized clinical trials have provided strong evi-
dence that BP-lowering treatment reduces the risk of over-
all mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure,
and CKD.3­7 However, some population-based studies have
shown an increased risk of CVD mortality among treated
hypertensive persons compared with untreated hypertensive
persons.19,20 It would be more appropriate to use treated con-
trolled hypertensive persons as the reference group to evaluate
the risk of health outcomes associated with hypertension treat-
ment and control status. Our findings emphasize the important
role of BP control with antihypertensive treatment in reducing
the risk of total and CVD mortality. Compared to clinical tri-
als, the treated controlled rate was substantially lower in the
US hypertensive population. Only 38% of treated persons had
BP levels at therapeutic goals defined as SBP <140mmHg and
DBP <90mmHg (SBP <130mmHg and DBP <80mmHg if
diabetes or CKD coexisted) in the NHANES 1988­1994.
The current BP control rates remain poor in the US hyper-
tensive population especially in the older persons and those
with coexisting medical conditions.21,22 Untreated hyper-
tension presents another Public Health challenge as it affects
a large proportion of the general hypertensive population.
In our study, >75% of untreated hypertensive persons did not
have pre-existing diabetes, CKD, heart attack, heart failure, or
stroke. However, they are still at greater risk of all-cause and
CVD mortality, mainly due to higher BP values compared with
their treated controlled counterparts.
The relationship between BP and cardiovascular risk has
long been recognized from large randomized clinical tri-
als and epidemiological studies. However, there has been an
ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of various
components of BP in predicting CVD.23,24 Our findings sup-
port the prevailing belief that SBP is the most consistent and
significant predictor of CVD death.25,26 The importance of
other BP parameters in predicting CVD mortality may depend
on the study population. For example, the Framingham heart
study showed that PP was superior to SBP or DBP in predict-
ing coronary heart disease risk in normotensive and untreated
hypertensive middle-aged and elderly adults.27 However, PP
and MAP are not routinely used in clinical practice. Taking
into account both SBP and DBP levels, hypertensive persons
with SBP/DBP 120/80mmHg had almost 2.0-fold increased
risk of CVD death compare to those with SBP <120mmHg
and DBP <80mmHg.
The relative impact of different drug treatment regimens
on cardiovascular events and mortality is another controver-
sial issue.28­30 Results from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-
Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial indicated that
diuretics were equal or superior to other antihypertensive agents
in preventing one or more major forms of CVD.31,32 In 2003,
two meta-analyses of multiple randomized controlled trials
both came to the conclusion that all classes of 
antihypertensive

agents reduced all-cause and CVD-related mortality equally.4,5
The largest meta-analysis of randomized trials published in
2009 further confirms the benefit of cardiovascular protection
with the five major classes of BP-lowering drugs.33 In contrast,
the Women's Health Initiative Observation Study found that
women receiving monotherapy with calcium channel blockers,
compared to those receiving monotherapy with diuretics, were
more likely to experience CVD mortality.34 Tardif et al. reported
an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor­based treatment
strategy associated with reduced mortality from all-cause, CVD,
and coronary heart disease compared with a calcium channel
blocker­based strategy among hypertensives.35 The differences
between observational studies and clinical trials of mortality in
relation to antihypertensive drug classes might be partially due
to different risk profiles of hypertensive persons at baseline. In
addition, the difference might be due to the fact that in observa-
tional studies, current antihypertensive medication use is often
the result of past successes or failures with other drug treatment
regimens. The findings of our US hypertensive population data
are comparable with the results of previously reported clinical
trials and support the notion that control BP is more important
than the type of drug selection.
The major strength of this study is the use of the NHANES
data to provide population-based estimates of the associa-
tion of hypertension treatment, control, and BP parameters
with CVD mortality and premature death. The method of
BP measurement in our study is fully consistent with the
national standards. An average of six BP readings obtained on
two separate occasions were used to define hypertension and
classify BP categories. However, several limitations should be
taken into consideration when interpreting our findings. First,
the cross-sectional design of our observational study and the
passive mortality data linkage approach limited our ability to
update exposure and covariate status. BP readings here are just
being taken as one point in time (the baseline), and may not
be entirely representative of BP ranges that prevailed over the
hypertensive person's lifetime. Also, the total length of duration
of hypertension could not be controlled. Assuming it is likely
that untreated, or uncontrolled hypertensive persons may
become treated, or controlled during the follow-up period, the
hazard ratio for mortality for untreated or uncontrolled hyper-
tension is probably underestimated in the present study, and in
general our hazard ratio estimates are biased toward the null.
Second, possible bias arising from missing data in multivari-
able adjusted analyses can not be ruled out. Excluded hyper-
tensive subjects were more likely to be non-Hispanic blacks,
less likely to be former smokers, had a higher proportion of
sedentary lifestyles, and a lower proportion of diabetes than
those included in the fully adjusted model. However, these
differences should have little impact on hazard ratio estimates
considering the fact that excluded data are equally distributed
in terms of age, gender, hypertension treatment and control
status, BP levels, drug classes, monotherapy or polytherapy,
all-cause mortality, and CVD deaths.
Although it is well established that hypertension is a strong,
independent risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease,
the impact of hypertension treatment, control, and of specific
BP indexes on the total and CVD mortality are less completely
addressed in the general hypertensive population. Using the
NHANES III and mortality follow-up data, our study found
that compared to the treated controlled hypertensive popula-
tion, both the treated uncontrolled and untreated hypertensive
populations had an increased risk of both all-cause and CVD
mortality, especially among those without comorbidities. SBP
was the best independent predictor of all-cause and CVD mor-
tality. This highlights the importance of achieving the SBP treat-
ment goals as recommended by current national guidelines.
We believe that our findings may have significant implications
for both Public Health and clinical intervention programs to
reduce excess mortality risk through hypertensive treatment
and control among the high-risk hypertensive population.
