Introduction
This article aims to investigate the language used by public
employment officers when they explain how they assist
female immigrants in the process of entering the Swedish
labor market. It takes its point of departure from current
debates about immigration and the challenges that the 21st
century faces as a result of increased movement of human
capital across national borders. An expected shortage of
labor in the European market due to a decreasing population
poses a challenge for politicians, who have to negotiate
between a growing demand for an influx of non-European
labor and a promise to their voters to limit immigration. The
difficulty faced by immigrants in entering the Swedish labor
market is a well-known problem among politicians, and the
effort to come to terms with the issue has long been on the
political agenda. Thus, despite policymakers' concern about
diversity and a relatively well-developed framework for inte-
grating immigrants into Sweden, immigrants continue to
experience discrimination in the labor market. This is evi-
dent from studies showing not only that immigrants have
higher unemployment rates and lower incomes than native
Swedes but also that they are overrepresented in low-skilled
and low-status jobs (De los Reyes &Wingborg, 2002; Rydgren,
2004 SCB - Statistiska Centralbyrån, [Statistics Sweden];
SCB, 2009). Figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics
show that the income of all immigrant groups is significantly
lower than that of native Swedes, and this hits immigrants
from Africa and Asia the hardest as these groups are also the
most exposed to unemployment. In 2008, the unemployment
rate within these groups was 31.0% and 22.5%, respectively
(SCB, 2009). It is noteworthy that their level of education is
often higher than that of other immigrant groups as well as
higher than that of native Swedes. Studies further show that
highly educated immigrants often get stuck in low-skilled
jobs that do not match their qualifications, and that those
who get jobs within their professions earn lower incomes
than members of the native-born population with similar
training. Immigrants who obtain employment are often found
in poorly paid jobs that seldom correspond to their education
or earlier experience (Rydgren, 2004). According to De los
Reyes and Wingborg's (2002) study, immigrants are particu-
larly overrepresented among manual workers, cleaners,

The Darker Side of Integration Policy:
A Study of Public Employment Officers'
Discursive Construction of Female
Immigrants' Employability
Agneta Moulettes1
Abstract
Despite its remarkable receptivity to immigrants entering the country, Sweden has one of the worst track records in Europe
in terms of employing immigrants. However, although there are various studies devoted to integration issues, little scholarly
attention has been directed toward public employment officers and their role as professional mediators in the integration
process. By investigating the language used by public employment officers when they explain how they assist female immigrants
in the process of entering the Swedish labor market, this study attempts to add to our knowledge of these officers and their
role. It uses ideas from postcolonial theory and critical discourse analysis to show (a) how public employment officers make
use of prevailing discourses to transform female immigrants from passive welfare beneficiaries into active and responsible
job seekers, (b) how prevailing discourses contribute to the reproduction of culture and gender differences reminiscent of
colonial discourses, and (c) how unequal power relations may favor the segregation of mainstream and alternative cultures.

restaurant assistants, and health care assistants. Furthermore,
Bakshi, Hatlevall, and Melchert (2009) call attention to the
fact that only 20% of newly arrived immigrants receive pro-
fessional support from the Public Employment Service
Agency (PESA; Arbetsförmedlingen). Their study further
shows that the number of male immigrants who are given the
opportunity to participate in work-supportive activities is
higher than the number of female immigrants who are given
such an opportunity. Besides the Swedish studies mentioned
above, a number of international studies draw attention to the
fact that immigrants are still subjected to both explicit and
implicit prejudice in the labor market (e.g., Dietz, 2010;
Dovidio & Esses, 2001; Esses, Dietz, & Bhardwaj, 2006;
Hakak, Holzinger, & Zikic, 2010; Hosoda & Stone-Romero,
2010; Jackson, Kendrick, Tony, & Bryant, 2001; Petersen &
Dietz, 2008). Esses, Dovidio, Jackson, andArmstrong (2001)
argue, for instance, that even if the economies of nations are
more interrelated and interdependent today, prejudice toward
minority groups within the country as well as toward immi-
grants from other countries still characterizes the attitude of
many individuals.
Although the integration of immigrants is fairly well doc-
umented in the literature, the main interest has so far been
focused on the existence of discriminatory practices among
employers and on unemployed immigrants' feelings about
being excluded from the labor market. In spite of the appar-
ently large amount of interest in integration issues, little
scholarly attention has been directed toward public employ-
ment officers and their role as professional mediators in the
integration process. Given the figures referred to above and
the fact that Sweden has one of the worst track records in
Europe in terms of employing immigrants (Sanandaji, 2012),
I contend that public employment officers' role in the inte-
gration process deserves scholarly attention.
This article takes an interest in culture and gender dis-
courses and the language used by public employment offi-
cers when describing how they help female immigrants to
enter the labor market. The focus here on public employment
officers is mainly due to the fact that unemployed job seekers
have to register at their local employment agency to receive
economic support from the government. This means that
public employment officers are deeply involved in the
employment process. Also, because the study focuses on a
marginalized group, in terms of both nationality and sex, I
am especially interested in how the power of prevailing dis-
courses on culture and gender is reflected in public employ-
ment officers' discursive accounts with respect to this group.
Thus, we seek to show (a) how public employment officers
make use of prevailing discourses to transform female immi-
grants from passive welfare beneficiaries into active and
responsible job seekers, (b) how prevailing discourses con-
tribute to the reproduction of culture and gender differences
reminiscent of colonial discourses, and (c) how unequal
power relations may favor the segregation of mainstream and
alternative cultures. For this purpose, we are drawing on
Phillips, Lawrence, and Hardy's (2004) and Bové's (1995)
definition of discourse as a collection of meaningful texts (in
this case, spoken words) that are embedded in powerful insti-
tutions and practices. To achieve our aim, we will use a con-
versation technique and analyze the language used by public
employment officers when they describe their encounters
with female immigrants. Conversation technique refers to
the use of open interviews resembling conversations rather
than traditional interviews that follow a strict interview
guide. We will use ideas from postcolonial theory and critical
discourse analysis (CDA), as we see them as a potentially
insightful lens for bringing to the surface representations of
colonial imprints that may be hidden in the discursive
accounts. Furthermore, an interpretative method will be used
in the analyses and the presentation of the study.
The article begins by introducing some theoretical discus-
sions that we find relevant to our study. Following an expla-
nation of the research design, findings from the study will be
presented and discussed.
Looking at Culture and Gender
Through the Postcolonial Lens
The conceptualization of culture and gender differences
finds its roots in the colonial discourse and its dichotomized
and hierarchical ordering of the Western and the non-West-
ern worlds (Fougère & Moulettes, 2012b; Jack & Westwood,
2006, 2009). As postcolonial scholars (Mignolo, 2011; Said,
1978) remind us, the colonial system favored colonizers over
colonized, males over females, and European patriarchy over
other forms of gender construction. Succeeding in the colo-
nial conquest and its endeavor to achieve modernity and
capitalism required a strategy imposing a social order that
made the Europeans masters of the universe. The concept of
coloniality and questions of colonialism and racism were
highlighted by the Latin Americans Mariategui in the 1930s
and O'Gorman in the 1950s (Mignolo, 2011), but it was Said
(1978) who made Westerners aware of the way these ideas
have influenced our perception of the world. Said's ground-
breaking book, Orientalism, informs us that colonialism was
one of the most profound and significant experiences that
shaped Europeans' perception not only of Orientals but also,
and perhaps mainly, of themselves--as well as Orientals'
perceptions of themselves (Fougère & Moulettes, 2012a). As
argued by Said, the imperialist powers needed to create the
Orient as an "Other," to define themselves as the center. To
achieve success in this endeavor required a colonial strategy
that systematically led colonized people to understand them-
selves as the inferior and backward Other. From a postcolo-
nial or post-Occidental (a concept coined by Mignolo)
perspective, it is not the fear of difference per se but rather
the fear of the superiority that the others may possess and of
the threat this may pose to our image of cultural identity that
causes ethnocentrism and the exclusion of those we perceive
as different. Positioning culture as both resemblance and
Moulettes 3
menace, Bhabha (1994) argues that "the colonial mimicry is
the desire for a reformed, recognizable Other, as a subject of
a difference that is almost the same, but not quite" (p. 86).
From this standpoint, therefore, the notion of a homogeneous
culture needs to be continuously repeated to be kept alive.
The construction of social labels is thus not just a way to
make existence easier to comprehend but a way to fix peo-
ple--a fixation that, in spite of an expressed desire among
the colonialists to mold the others into a common pattern and
the latter's effort to become integrated, will keep them apart.
As Fanon (1967) suggests, this is a culture that is "fixed in its
colonial status . . . both present and mummified" (p. 44), and
as such, it determines minorities' place in society.
The strategy that was applied also favored men's posi-
tion in society by attributing to them characteristics associ-
ated with power, while undermining women's position by
presenting them as disregarded adjuncts to males (A.
Prasad, 2006; Said, 1978). The legacy of colonialism and
its representation of men as rational, active, assertive, mod-
ern, and normal, while women are characterized as emo-
tional, passive, irresolute, backward, superstitious, and
abnormal, is still present today (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). It is,
as Lugones (2000) points out, "what lies in the intersection
of gender/class/race as central constructs of the capitalist
world system of power" (p. 746). The continuous repetition
of culture and gender differences has imposed a way of
thinking about the world and the way we should live our
lives. Like national culture, gender has traditionally been
perceived as essentialistic and constituted as a homoge-
neous group identity (Collison & Hearn, 1996; Mohanty,
2003; Moulettes, 2007; A. Prasad, 2003). Hence, just as the
inhabitants of a country are assumed to be bound together
by the notion of shared culture, men, and likewise women,
are assumed to be bound together by a sociological notion
of "sameness." As a result, we see both culture and gender
dichotomies operating normatively within an organization
(Lugones, 2000) and thus contributing to the
reproduction of gendered and cultural inequality outside
the organization.
One reason why the stress on culture and gender has
become so important in contemporary society may be peo-
ple's enhanced vigilance in the effort to keep the discourse of
cultural difference and the classification of people by race,
ethnicity, geographic origin, gender, and the like alive in
times of increased migration and external pressure and
uncertainty. Although professionals may be convinced that
they treat everybody the same, it is plausible that their sub-
jective notions and pressure from the environment to keep
the image of cultural and gendered homogeneity alive may
affect their mind-set and actions. To judge from Meyer and
Rowan's (1977) findings, organizations are likely to mirror
the myths and values of their institutional environment, and
irrespective of whether they wish to conform to these myths
and values or not, people consequently contribute to the
reproduction of the dominant discourse.
According to P. Prasad (1997), organizations are places
where colonial imprints are put into practice in the sense that
they contribute to the shaping of organizational values and
actions. They are also, as scholars such as Gherardi (1994)
and Pullen and Rhodes (2012) inform us, powerful places for
the (re)construction of gender. However, because the continu-
ous repetition has transformed them into taken-for-granted
features, it is a process that generally takes place unnoticed.
Like our stereotyped images of culture, gender too passes, as
Pullen and Knights (2007) point out, "as unnoticed, denied or
disavowed, partly because it is `done' routinely, repeatedly
and unknowingly and with a degree of automaticity that con-
ceals its precariousness and performativity" (p. 505). Keeping
this in mind, I ask to what extent these notions may influence
public employment officers and how much they are contribut-
ing to power asymmetries between them and those they are
supposed to assist in finding jobs. We further ask what atti-
tudes they present when describing their encounters with
female immigrants and to what extent colonial imprints are
discursively reproduced in their accounts. One way to inves-
tigate this is to combine postcolonial ideas with a discourse
analytic technique and scrutinize the language used by public
employment officers when they describe how they assist
female immigrants to find jobs.
Discourse and Performativity
Any presentation of discourse should perhaps start by paying
homage to de Saussure (1967), who introduced the idea that
the relationship between structure (langue) and practice
(parole) is arbitrary; to Derrida (1967), who claimed that it is
as a result of logocentrism that texts can be seen to be struc-
tured around binary oppositions; to Lacan (1966), who
claimed that the idea of a true and whole self is a myth; and
to Foucault (1963, 1977), who argued that the social world
and the relations of power that characterize it are determined
by discursive formations. Besides having been important
sources of inspiration to postcolonial scholars (e.g., Bhabha,
1994; Said, 1978; Spivak, 1988a, 1988b; Young, 2000,
2001), they have also influenced scholars such as Fairclough
(1989), Grant, Keenoy, and Oswick (1998), Laclau and
Mouffe (1985), Phillips et al. (2004), Potter and Wetherell
(1987), Van Dijk (1997), and Wodak (1989, 1997), who in
turn have contributed to the expansion of discourse across
disciplines and to the development of CDA. Broadly under-
stood as talk and texts embedded in powerful institutions and
practices, CDA takes an interest in the exploration and delin-
eation of power relations in society. In practice, this approach
to discourse generally combines discourse analytic tech-
niques with a critical perspective to interrogate social phe-
nomena (Ainsworth & Hardy, 2004).
There is, thus, a long tradition of critical research in the
social sciences and humanities, but the view of what "criti-
cal" means and how it is justified in different traditions var-
ies. Referred to as "ideology critique," one of the versions of
4 SAGE Open
critical discourse analysis targets the presumption, dissimu-
lation, or manipulation of knowledge that shapes people's
mind-set (Stenner & Marshall, 1995; Van Dijk, 1997).
Scholars within this tradition argue that power relations in
society are accompanied by a hegemonic language that sys-
tematically masks the world and claim that the aim of the
critique is, therefore, to subvert power by showing the reality
behind the ideology and what it really stands for (Winther
Jørgensen & Phillips, 1999). For example, although people
may say one thing, the continuous repetition of taken-for-
granted assumptions often makes them act in a completely
different way. Hence, the researcher's role is to unveil the
ideology so that people can see what is hidden behind it and
get the chance to change the prevailing discourses. By and
large, this view corresponds to Foucault's (1963, 1977)
understanding of power as both productive and oppressive.
Contrary to Van Dijk's (1993, 1997) emphasis on power as
an exclusively oppressive force, Foucault explains power
both as a discursively constructed subject position that peo-
ple occupy and perform and as the object of various dis-
courses that attempt to control and normalize people.
Drawing on Bentham's design of a model prison, Foucault
(1997) argues that all modern institutional forms mimic the
patterns of a panopticon's way of organized surveillance and
claims that the establishment of rules and judgments around
the idea of norms "has become one of the great instruments
of power" (p. 184). Rather than forcing people to follow the
rules, according to Foucault, applying impersonal surveil-
lance that produces subjects who act as if they are being con-
stantly watched and thus discipline their own behavior so as
to achieve normality has become a more successful means of
control in modern society.
In this article, we lean on the above approach to CDA, as
I use CDA to challenge mainstream research and its essen-
tialistic, monolithic, and static assumption regarding both
culture and gender. We are particularly interested in how
power asymmetries contribute to the reproduction of taken-
for-granted assumptions reminiscent of colonial culture and
gender discourses. Said (1978) explains that language itself
is a highly organized and encoded system, which uses many
devices to express, indicate, and exchange messages and
information. Questioning whether there can be a true repre-
sentation of anything, he concludes that "we must be pre-
pared to accept the fact that a representation is eo ipso
implicated, intertwined, embedded, interwoven with a great
many other things besides the `truth,' which is itself a repre-
sentation" (Said, 1978, p. 272).
Rather than viewing culture and gender identities as
essentialistic, monolithic, and static, we agree with the idea
that they are talked into being and performed according to
prevailing discourses. As Perryman (2006) reminds us, the
term performativity was coined by Lyotard (1984), who, in
"The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge,"
argued that postmodern society is obsessed with efficiency
and effectiveness, and that this efficiency is increasingly
"measured according to an input/output ratio" (p. 88). Since
then, the idea of performativity has been used by a number of
scholars who take an interest in the connection between
structures, institutions, and practice (Cameron, 1995;
González, 2004; Lee, 2015; Perryman, 2006). For example,
in her theory of performativity, Butler (1990) argues that
gender identities do not simply exist; they are talked into
being over time and are performed according to the dis-
courses that existed prior to one's performance of them. The
idea that performativity is about performing the normal
within a particular discourse is, as pointed out by Cameron
(1995), equally valid for any fixed and substantive social
label. The continuous striving for normality is also the reason
why cultural and gender differences always need to be
repeated to be kept alive (Bhabha, 1994).
Drawing on this insight, I argue that employment officers
are socialized into prevailing discourses and influenced by
mechanisms that impose efficiency (Lyotard, 1984) and nor-
mality (Foucault, 1977). It is plausible to assume that they
will perform in accordance with prevailing discourses and, in
their effort to obtain efficiency, will attempt to transform
unemployed people into subjects who secure current dis-
courses, while excluding those deviating from normality.
And as this often takes place routinely and unknowingly
(Pullen & Knights, 2007), it is likely to favor power asym-
metries and the reproduction of prejudice about "Others."
This may occur when values and behavior patterns are
imposed on a person and/or when a person is reminded that
he or she does not belong. A classic example of the latter is
provided when a person with a foreign-sounding name, who
looks different or speaks with an accent, is asked where he or
she comes from and, hence, is presumed to be a foreigner.
Other examples occur when it is presumed that he or she will
not behave according to the prevailing norms or when it is
presumed that he or she lacks sufficient skills to perform effi-
ciently. The latter may occur due to differences in working
methods or when inadequate language skills are taken for
granted to hinder immigrants' work performance.
In this article, I will scrutinize the impact of power asym-
metries in the relationship between employment officers and
unemployed female immigrants. I will pay particular attention
to (a) how public employment officers make use of prevailing
discourses to transform female immigrants from passive wel-
fare beneficiaries into active and responsible job seekers, (b)
how prevailing discourses contribute to the reproduction of
culture and gender differences reminiscent of colonial dis-
courses, and (c) how unequal power relations may favor the
segregation of mainstream and alternative cultures. These
issues are interrelated, in the sense that they all contribute to
power asymmetries related to the neocolonial discourse.
Methodological Considerations and
Research Technique
Using the transcripts of our interviews, I sought to go beneath
the surface meaning in the participants'accounts and uncover
the meanings hidden within them (A. Prasad & Mir, 2002). I
Moulettes 5
used a convenience sampling as I was interested in the rich-
ness and nuances of the participants' accounts rather than
figures, objective facts, and general patterns (Broadbridge,
2009). Given the limited number of participants, my study
does not allow me to make any generalizations in the tradi-
tional sense. Nevertheless, as Denzin and Lincoln (2000)
argue, neither an individual nor a case is just an individual or
a case. The study of the particular is the study of the general,
and the longer, more detailed, and more intensive the tran-
scripts, the fewer the participants who are needed to saturate
the empirical material (Rudestam & Newton, 2007).
The sample included 12 in-depth interviews with public
employment officers in five PESA branches in the southern
part of Sweden. The participants consisted of eight women
and four men with different educational and career back-
grounds (e.g., they included a former teacher, a lawyer, a for-
mer journalist, and several sociologists). They had worked
for between 1 and 25 years at the PESA. As it was important
to the research that the participants should feel comfortable,
I let them choose the location for the interview. In most
cases, the choice fell on their office, while a coffee shop in
town and the home environment were chosen by some of the
participants. The interviews lasted between 1 hr and 3 hr and
were transcribed word for word.
As the research was exploratory in nature, I wanted the
interviews to be respondent-driven rather than interview-
driven. The interviews were performed, therefore, as conver-
sations instead of conventional interviews based on structural
questionnaires, which meant that I had prepared only some
broad questions that covered the main purpose of our
research. It further meant that I had some general themes to
guide the interviews, but I kept them as open as possible to
allow respondents to answer as freely as they wished. The
interview technique I chose provided an opportunity for the
interviewees to reflect on the areas they found to be most
pertinent to the professional/client relationship. This meant
that in some instances, questions were initiated by the
researcher, while in other instances, they were asked as natu-
ral follow-ups to the preceding conversation. The chosen
approach allowed for flexibility without a loss of focus on
the most salient points and enabled the collection of multi-
layered information without the superimposition of a rigid
structure by the researchers (Broadbridge, 2009). All meth-
ods have their advantages and disadvantages, and a research
method based on a seemingly loose protocol is no exception.
Its major disadvantage is that there is no guarantee that it will
provide a cohesive pattern, as the interviewees are allowed to
speak freely and tell their own stories. However, this can be
seen as one of the advantages, as it may provide information
that would not be discovered in traditional interviews where
structured or semistructured questionnaires are used. Put
bluntly, the stories that people provide may unveil attitudes
that would otherwise remain hidden.
The interview accounts analyzed in this study have been
selected from a larger study of public and private labor
market intermediaries' work in assisting immigrants to enter
the Swedish labor market. One reason for focusing on female
immigrants was that one of the questions asked in the larger
study of the integration of immigrants was related to Bakshi
et al.'s (2009) earlier study, which showed that female immi-
grants receive less assistance from the public agency than do
men. Another reason was that the interviewees in the larger
study often referred to female immigrants when they
explained how they helped immigrants to find jobs.
Aselection of material for an analysis is a sine qua non for
any study, because for obvious reasons, it is neither useful
nor even possible to include everything that is transcribed
from interviews. As I wanted to draw attention to what is
often silenced and suppressed due to the scholarly effort to
obtain neutrality, I decided to interpret the accounts through
a postcolonial lens. It was thus important to select accounts
that contained material relevant to the aim of the article and
to include statements about female immigrants. As a conse-
quence of this process, the article does not provide a full pic-
ture of employment officers' perception of unemployed
immigrants. This means that the positive attitudes toward
immigration expressed by two of the interviewees, a man in
his 50s and a woman in her 30s, are not included in the analy-
sis. Both of these interviewees defended immigrants' rights
and emphasized the economic, social, and cultural benefits
of immigration. They also expressed concerns about some of
their colleagues' as well as employers' negative attitudes
toward immigrants.
The interviews were transcribed in Swedish and later
organized into themes such as background and earlier experi-
ences, administration, receiving job seekers, and assisting
immigrants. The last-mentioned theme was divided into sub-
themes such as vocational guidance, vocational training,
work practice, attitudes toward immigrants, and statements
about female immigrants. In a second phase, a selection of
interview accounts that were considered especially interest-
ing for this article was translated into English. Due to the
translation from Swedish to English, the excerpts do not
always render the exact words or expressions used. However,
an effort was made to keep the translation as close as possi-
ble to the original texts.
The Swedish Public Employment
Service Agency
The first step toward the creation of a public employment
agency was taken in 1940 with the establishment of the Labor
Market Commission. The aim was to help people earn their
living during World War II. Over time, the commission's
activities continually developed to reflect changes in the labor
market and society. A major change came in the early 1990s,
when public sector reforms became a priority and market
solutions were introduced within the PESA. Due to the influ-
ence of the neoliberal ideas that began to flourish in Europe in
the 1970s, new public management was implemented by the
6 SAGE Open
right-wing government of Sweden in the early 1990s as a
way to come to terms with a bureaucracy that was considered
by politicians to have grown out of proportion (Green-
Pedersen, 2002).
A significant change in employment officers' work rou-
tines came with technological developments and the intro-
duction of a standardized coding system aiming at facilitating
labor market control. This meant that the officers' conditions
of work changed, in the sense that they now had to spend
more time at the computer producing statistics for the author-
ities. To make the system more efficient, new routines, such
as individual activation plans and work applications reports,
have recently been introduced. The former are executed by
the employment officer at the first meeting with a client,
while the latter, which aims at showing the unemployed per-
sons' active search for a job, is produced on a regular basis
by the unemployed persons themselves.
Another significant change came in 1993, when the
employment agency's monopoly expired and private labor
market agencies were established Svensk för fattnings sam-
ling (SFS), 1993 [Swedish Code of Statutes]. However,
although competition from private labor agencies is growing
steadily, job seekers are still obliged to visit the PESA on a
regular basis to obtain their unemployment allowance.
Today, the public employment service consists of 320 local
branches of the PESA and approximately 350 private
employment service agencies, of which 165 are operating as
coaching consultancies. The consultancies are financially
supported by the government but receive their clients from
the PESA.
Transforming Clients From Passive
Welfare Beneficiaries Into Active and
Responsible Job Seekers
One of the reasons behind the implementation of market-
based reforms was the desire to provide cheaper and more
efficient services (Green-Pedersen, 2002). Besides the fact
that officers have more clients to take care of, their adminis-
trative workload has also increased. Maria, a young employ-
ment officer, who had been at the agency for some years,
explained,
I have one hour to prepare this [action plan] before I meet them
[the clients]. "Welcome to Sweden. I have 20 questions that I
need to ask you," dah, dah, dah . . . and that's it. "I have written
an action plan for you; here you are. This is our agreement.
Thank you and goodbye."
Judging from Maria's account, it appears that she is not
satisfied with the current situation, as she now has to spend
more time at the computer, entering statistical data and pre-
paring action plans, than in assisting her clients to find jobs.
Reflecting on how her work has changed, Maria explained,
There used to be those who literally took the immigrants by the
hand and helped them getting to the right place. "If you are
unsure how to get to L., I can come with you." One might think
that it would be easy for them to get there by themselves,
maybe--if they have come all the way from Beirut . . . .
Even if it was not part of their job description, some of her
colleagues used to help immigrants who, they considered,
needed special attention, to find their way to "the right
place," which could be anything from a local authority office
to an educational institution or a potential workplace. This
kind of help was now considered too time-consuming and
costly and had therefore been abandoned. The abandonment
of this kind of assistance may partly be explained by the gov-
ernment's effort to get rid of the image of Sweden as a
bureaucratic nanny state (Green-Pedersen, 2002). However,
Maria's statement also demonstrates that the officers' free-
dom to act has been cut down and that they now are more
careful to perform according to the rules. An enhanced anxi-
ety among employment officers about being monitored was
also demonstrated in the interview with Marta, who, although
she was promised anonymity, was careful about her answers
and, in response to several of the questions, claimed she did
not have the necessary statistics to answer them. Besides
demonstrating the existence of power asymmetries between
employment officers and their supervisors, the officers'
apparently enhanced caution may be seen as an indicator of
panoptic performativity (Foucault, 1977).
Supportive Activities for Those Who Deserve
Them
The idea of the active society is that exclusion from the labor
market can be avoided through social and cultural investment
(Caswell, Marston, & Elm Larsen, 2010). In Sweden, this
idea manifests itself in a push for cultural and social invest-
ment to counteract the exclusion of marginalized groups from
the labor market. At the time of the study, some of the staff
members at one of the employment offices I visited were
working on the guidelines for a new integration policy for
newly arrived immigrants, which was going to be imple-
mented later that year. Martin, an employment agency man-
ager, and one of the people responsible for this task, speaks as
a representative for the professional core when he explains
the politicians' intention in implementing the reform:
Within this new reform that we are preparing . . . there's a very
important economic "incentive," that is, you can no longer take
advantage of the Social Services Act and say that we have this
family that needs money. Every adult has to apply for financial
support and participate in activities to get it. This means that
[for] the family or the woman . . . or whoever takes the ultimate
decision in the family that someone shouldn't work but stay
home and take care of the household and the children, it will hit
them financially.
Moulettes 7
What Martin describes is a reform that encourages a pol-
icy where welfare benefits are associated with economic
sanctions. Hence, the reform is intended to encourage all
adult family members to register at the employment office,
but it is particularly intended to put pressure on female immi-
grants to leave their lives as housewives and register as job
seekers. The idea that female immigrants often stay at home
to take care of their families is a view that most employment
officers share; they also believe it to be the main reason why
female immigrants receive less support from the PESA than
male immigrants do. According to employment officers'
statements, female immigrants' absence from working life
for an extended period of time is also believed to make their
later entry into the labor market more difficult. Philip, an
employment officer specializing in coaching, was one of
those who made the connection between child care and the
difficulty of finding employment on later entry to the labor
market:
I believe that [the difficulty] is because female immigrants stay
home and take care of their children. They stay away from
working life 10 years before they register. They take care of their
families. That's not common among Swedish women. Female
immigrants who have stayed home and taken care of their
children are very far from the labor market.
When Cesar was asked whether women are equally sup-
ported (i.e., to the same extent as men), he replied,
Yes, all clients are equally supported. We support them as much
as we can. We even offer a coach who can assist them in finding
a position as a trainee. But as a trainee you have to show that you
deserve the job. So what happens if you stay home for a couple
of days? [The mothers get a] call from the day care center and
well . . . there are women . . . I have heard them; [the preschool
teachers] call them and say their child has got a cold and [the
mothers] stop (ha-ha) and say, "I'm on my way."
Judging by Cesar's statement, one possible explanation
for the higher unemployment rate among female immigrants
seems to be that they cannot be trusted to give their time to
their jobs while they invest so much time in their children.
This seems to be what Cesar is suggesting when he explains
that these women will leave their job when they get a "call
from the day care center" telling them that "their child has
got a cold." Apparently, a job-seeking mother should not pri-
oritize her children. It would be intriguing to ask what a
Swedish parent (man or woman) would do in this situation.
Besides the fact that Cesar's conclusion is simplistic and
biased, it reproduces an image of female immigrants as a
homogeneous group of child producers who cannot be
trusted in employment as long as they give priority to their
children. In this respect, Cesar seems to believe that all
women coming from outside the Western world can be cate-
gorized as one homogeneous group of unreliable female
immigrants. Cesar's statement that "as a trainee you have to
show that you deserve the job" indicates that the help offered
is not guided by a genuine concern for clients' needs but
rather conditioned by a counter performance. In this particu-
lar case, the counter performance consists of showing that
one has proven to be worthy of a job. Unemployed female
immigrants, thus, seem to correspond to what Caswell et al.
(2010) refer to as "at risk" clients, over whom officials, as
professionals, have the power to generate consequences
(Jenkins, 2000) if clients are not willing to adjust to the pre-
vailing conditions and act as responsible job seekers. Besides
demonstrating the existence of power asymmetries between
agency officers and the unemployed, Cesar's statement indi-
cates that the officers, as professionals, feel they are being
put under enhanced pressure to normalize female immi-
grants, so as to make them seem more employable.
Correction of Cultural Flaws to Maintain the
Notion of Cultural Superiority
The interview accounts further reveal how the officials guide
their clients to make them more attractive in entering the
labor market. An important feature of this work is to con-
vince the immigrants of the importance of adjusting to
Swedish culture. The view that cultural differences are flaws
that need to be corrected is illustrated in the following
account provided by Karin:
Well, take the teaching profession, for example, where you have
different school systems in different countries and where you
have different views on teaching methods and we have our view.
I had this problem with a woman from the Balkans once. There
were quite a few people from the Balkans who . . . it was more
about teaching methods and things like that. All the children are
forced to write with their right hand. Such a teaching method
does not work in the Swedish school. . . . But then I sit here as a
wicked person when I tell this woman who has this education
and who has worked for many years at home, "You have to
reconsider. You have to take a supplementary course." . . . If you
are a craftsman you can work as a trainee in a company and a
competent supervisor can make an evaluation and say, "Yes, he
knows this and this, but he seems to use other methods than the
ones we are used to and needs to learn how we work."
Karin highlights the differences between countries with
regard to teaching methods and ways of working. In doing
so, she implies that other educational systems do not match
the Swedish standard and that immigrants therefore need to
take supplementary courses. She is unwavering in her belief
that the supervisor is "competent," and she uses the example
of different teaching methods to exclude a client from a pro-
fession. She implicitly suggests that all members of a spe-
cific group need further education to live up to Swedish
standards, rather than acknowledging that the Swedish sys-
tem may benefit from incoming knowledge and practices. By
doing so, she reproduces a notion of logocentrism (Derrida,
1967), which by its emphasis on ethnocentrism favors the
8 SAGE Open
image of a Westernized center. The example given above
indicates that help has become an instrument of training
(Gronemeyer, 2010), in which the participants' cultural
adjustment is an important component. For the sake of eco-
nomic development, it is apparently not the needs of the indi-
viduals that are prioritized, but society's need for cultural
homogeneity. It may seem a bit strange, though, that some-
thing that seems so trivial should require so much further
education. However, the search for differences even in the
most trivial things may be seen as a strategy to keep the
image of cultural differences alive (Bhabha, 1994). Because
there were other interviewees who provided similar exam-
ples (e.g., that painters in Sweden learn to paint vertically,
while painters in some other countries learn to paint horizon-
tally), one may wonder whether the emphasis on further edu-
cation is just used as a pretext or whether it is grounded on
the presumption that the educational system in other coun-
tries never lives up to the Swedish standard.
"A Good Performance" Needs Appropriate
Clothing?
Implicit in the deficit discourse, one can discern the impor-
tance of making immigrants break with their past to become
integrated into Swedish society. The call for adjustment
reflects a fear of difference or a fear of the possible superior-
ity that the others might possess and what it might do to cul-
tural identity (e.g., Appadurai, 2006; Bhabha, 1994; Said,
1978). What is frightening today seems to be the influence of
non-Western cultures, and not least Islam and women dressed
in veils. For example, while referring to a Muslim woman
who had refused to remove her headscarf when offered a
position as a trainee in a restaurant, Lisa, a career adviser,
shared her own opinion of the political debate about the
burka:
. . . to get a job I do think that you actually may need to take off
your headscarf. For example, there was this discussion about the
burka in preschool and in this case I do think that you should
take it off when you are at work . . . so that you are able to do a
good job. Then, in your private life, you can wear it if you like.
Lisa's description conveys a value judgment about
Muslim women's style of dress, ultimately explaining that
she feels the implementation of a restriction is necessary for
a client to get a job. It is unclear, however, what kind of
headscarf or other covering she is referring to in this state-
ment and whether she makes a distinction between different
kinds of coverings or not. Nevertheless, she considers them
inappropriate clothing during working hours. She does not
clarify what she means by "doing a good job," and in what
way a headscarf may be in conflict with a professional role
and how it may hinder work performance. Yet her observa-
tion implies that wearing any piece of unconventional cloth-
ing is unsuitable and might have consequences for the
employer. What is interesting about statements such as these
is the frequency with which the "headscarf issue" surfaces
whenever integration is discussed, but not in terms of the
actual way in which it can cause a problem in a Swedish
workplace. It is also surprising that Lisa refers to the wearing
of a burka in preschools, considering that the number of
women wearing the burka is strictly limited in Sweden and
thus the use of this covering in schools does not seem to con-
stitute a real problem. Whatever Lisa's general intention may
be, the statement reflects the impact of the social disadvan-
tage that the headscarf is causing to the women who wear it
and the anti-Muslim sentiments that have become a frequent
feature in the Western world including Sweden. The state-
ment also indicates that there is a link between the fear of
difference (Appadurai, 2006; Bhabha, 1994) and what it may
mean for our supposed cultural identity. The discursive prac-
tice of marginalizing those considered different demonstrates
power inequality and the supremacy given to one's own
culture.
Exercise of Power in the Name of Civilization
Muslim culture is clearly regarded with suspicion, but this
extends to any unfamiliar culture, behavior, and custom. An
example of suspicion of unfamiliar behavior is provided by
Eva, who admits to being provoked when a woman arrives at
a scheduled meeting accompanied by her husband:
I have worked with many women . . . women who come from
other cultures, where their husbands come along and insist in
joining the discussion because they have this feudal culture. In
those cases . . . I don't think it's OK. We have to follow human
rights. We have to follow the democratic principles and so forth.
. . . But it's difficult because these women have to straighten
their backs. I can say, "No, I don't accept" [that they bring their
husbands along to the meeting] and book a new appointment.
The example demonstrates how Eva makes use of her
power as a professional to correct female immigrants' behav-
ior to make them adjust to what is presumably the expected
behavior in Swedish culture. It further demonstrates how the
reproduction of colonial imprints is used in practice. Judging
from Eva's statement, the type of behavior she describes is
simply not acceptable in a modern and democratic society.
According to her, couples such as the one she describes come
from a "feudal culture" that does not respect "human rights"
and "democratic principles." So now when they live in
Sweden, these women have to learn how to "straighten their
backs," by which Eva presumably means that they have to
become more independent. She assumes these women are
oppressed, that is, that their husbands prevent them from
interacting with society on their own terms, while instead
they may be bringing their husbands along for mental support
or because they feel insecure about their Swedish language
skills. Eva's use of words such as "feudal," "human rights,"
Moulettes 9
and "democracy" disclose her view of her clients'cultures as
backward and undemocratic and, hence, an assumption that
all women in these countries are oppressed by their hus-
bands. If in fact this is her assumption, it could be argued that
these women are regarded as supplemental not only by their
husbands but also by the employment officers.
Besides expressing a stereotypical and depreciatory view
of both men and women from "other cultures," Eva's state-
ment seems to be grounded in a fear that stems from views
similar to those Lisa expressed about Muslim women who
wear a headscarf. In essence, this line of thought corresponds
to Jackson et al.'s (2001) suggestion that threat is the closest
culturally universal link to prejudice and racism and the way
in which people behave toward outgroups. The statements
quoted above illustrate how power is exercised by the use of
words derived from the language of the dominant cultural
discourse. Rather than taking a serious interest in diversity,
the statements point at the importance of protecting the
notion of cultural homogeneity. Besides supporting
Meyerson's (2003) argument that people take advantage of
the language of the dominant culture, the statements show
that people also act in accordance with dominant ideas within
the institutional environment. This way of positioning domi-
nance over female immigrants is clearly reminiscent of colo-
nialism and its idea that failure to achieve a particular level
of civilization must be corrected for development to take
place.
Conclusion
What we have been concerned with in this article is how pub-
lic employment officers discursively describe how they
assist female immigrants in finding jobs. I have argued that
the transfer to a neoliberal society has affected public
employment officers' working conditions and that they have
been equipped with tools aiming at facilitating a transforma-
tion of clients from passive welfare beneficiaries into active
job seekers. The aims set out in this article were to show (a)
how public employment officers make use of prevailing dis-
courses to transform female immigrants from passive wel-
fare beneficiaries into active and responsible job seekers, (b)
how prevailing discourses contribute to the reproduction of
culture and gender differences reminiscent of colonial dis-
courses, and (c) how unequal power relations may favor the
segregation of mainstream and alternative cultures.
The findings of the study indicate that employment offi-
cers are working under increased pressure owing to a grow-
ing number of clients and changes in working routines.
Society's enhanced striving for efficiency probably puts
pressure on employment officers, as they, in their role as civil
servants, have to follow political directives as well as meet
employers' requirements for a supply of appropriately com-
petent workers. Furthermore, it is likely that the high unem-
ployment rate among immigrants and the fact that
employment officers have now been made responsible for
making the immigrants employable have put even more
pressure on them.
The findings further demonstrate that some employment
officers blame immigrants' difficulty in finding jobs on their
lack of education and cultural adjustment. This is manifested
in the officers' discursive accounts and their performance as
cultural role models, for example, when advising Muslim
women to take off their headscarves in work-related situa-
tions and when implicitly telling a female immigrant to
become independent by adjourning a meeting because the
female is accompanied by her husband. Taking into account
that one of the ideas behind the implementation of new pub-
lic management was to make public organizations more effi-
cient by measuring employees' performances, it may seem
natural to the officers to put the blame on immigrants'lack of
cultural adjustment, because although the placement of
immigrants is beyond the officers'control, they may fear that
the difficulty in integrating immigrants into the labor market
will have a negative effect on the officers' performance mea-
sures. This may be one explanation of the fact that female
immigrants are being presented as liabilities, who need to be
corrected to fit a supposedly necessary cultural mold. This
may explain why the higher unemployment rate among
female immigrants is blamed on a lack of education and cul-
tural adjustment.
However, employment officers' discursive accounts seem
paradoxical, as, on one hand, they lay stress on individuals'
need to take responsibility for finding a job, and, on the other,
they perceive of themselves as responsible for presenting
employable job seekers to the labor market. The policy of
blame implicit in employment officers'emphasis on a lack of
education and cultural adjustment seems in this respect to
support Eskelinen, Olesen, and Caswell's (2010) suggestion
that it is the employability of the clients rather than their situ-
ation that is the focus of employment officers' attention. It
also seems to support Esses et al.'s (2006) finding that cur-
rent activation policies seek to mold unemployed people to
fit them into changed conditions on the labor market. This in
turn indicates that employment officers act under the influ-
ence of the dominant discourses and favor the "work should
be rewarded" strategy set out by governments to reward the
working population and thereby tone down the "nanny state"
image (Green-Pedersen, 2002). Considering, however, that
the number of unemployed in Sweden at present amounts to
approximately 380,000 people (8% of the able-bodied popu-
lation) while the available vacancies are estimated at approx-
imately 70,000 (SCB, 2014), this might be perceived as a
rather demoralizing strategy by the unemployed, who,
despite their desires and efforts, remain outside the labor
market.
The findings further demonstrate how prejudices about
female immigrants are being reproduced in employment offi-
cers' discursive accounts. It demonstrates how female immi-
grantsarebeingdiscursivelylinkedtogetherasahomogeneous
group of non-Western, perpetually pregnant housewives with
10 SAGE Open
little education. The findings further demonstrate that cate-
gorizing immigrants as "the others" and ascribing stereotypi-
cal qualities to them supports Meyer and Rowan's (1977)
argument that people seek conformity and rely on myth and
institutional values. The depreciatory views of female immi-
grants that some of the employment officers express indicate
that these officials, besides being constrained in a profes-
sional role, are constrained by taken-for-granted assumptions
about immigrants and their background. The findings dem-
onstrate how stereotyped and prejudiced images reminiscent
of colonial discourse are put into discursive practice through
routines and tacit repetitions, thereby reinforcing the contin-
uance of inequality and marginalization (P. Prasad, 1997;
Pullen & Knights, 2007). They also reveal how people unre-
flectively lean on dominant discourses of differences charac-
terized by ethnocentrism and cultural singularities (e.g.,
Hofstede, 2001), and how prejudices about female immi-
grants are normalized through the continuous reproduction
of cultural hierarchy and patriarchy (Lugones, 2000; Said,
1978). Judging by the examples provided by the employment
officers, it is evident that the immigrants find themselves in
an inferior position that they have no or little power to
change. Their future in the labor market is in that sense very
much in the hands of the employment officers.
Furthermore, the continuous reproduction of dominant
discourses means that competing discourses are excluded
and that the concept of diversity is narrowed down to super-
ficial, essentialistic, dichotomized, and hierarchically
ordered categories of culture and gender. What is ignored in
the dominant discourses is that culture, independent of time
and space, may travel across borders and transform itself into
hybrid forms; that people have different histories and experi-
ence culture differently; and that countries are therefore
characterized by cultural fragmentation (Bhabha, 1994;
DiMaggio, 1997) rather than by fixed and homogeneous
entities. The desire to make unemployed immigrants adjust
to the norms points at the fact that the integration of immi-
grants follows the process of hegemony, privileging self
while neglecting values and behavior systems that deviate
from the norm. In response to the question on the effects of
unequal power relations, it could thus be argued that unequal
power relations between employment officers and immi-
grants favor the segregation of mainstream and alternative
cultures.
One conclusion that can be drawn from the findings of the
study is that integration is hard to achieve as long as immi-
grants are objectified and treated as "the others," and no sin-
cere effort is made to recognize them as individuals or to
admit our own bias and the fact that we may be blinded by
ethnocentrism and Western epistemology. From this perspec-
tive, discrimination awareness training among employment
officers may be one way to confront the privileging of self at
the expense of others and their value systems. Bearing in
mind that research addressing discrimination against immi-
grants in the labor market to date has been fairly limited in
Sweden, more research on this issue is needed. Because cat-
egorizations are always accompanied by human judgments,
there is a risk that those considered too difficult to help will
be unfairly classified in the coding system used at the
employment agency's offices. This leads me to the proposi-
tion that more research should be carried out in connection
with the relationship between the classification system and
discrimination against immigrants.
However, as the blame placed on unemployed immi-
grants' lack of cultural adjustments may be a symptom of a
dysfunctional system, this is probably not enough. What we
propose is research focusing on structural changes and the
transformation of work and its consequences for immigrants'
employability. Studies of immigrants and their experiences
could help address potential problems embedded in the cur-
rent system. For example, instead of evaluating employment
officers' performances based on measurements connected to
job placement rates, evaluations could be carried out through
a survey of immigrants enrolled at the employment agency.
Also, considering that immigrants' voices are seldom heard,
audit studies focusing on their experiences of the employ-
ment agency and their interactions with employment officers
could contribute to a further deepening of insights into
employment officers' role in the integration process. What
we suggest is studies investigating immigrants' opinions of
the employment agency and the help they receive from the
employment officers. What difficulties do they come across
in their encounter with the PESA? Would their chances of
finding a job be improved if more time was spent on assisting
them to find a job rather than on administration? This leads
to the question of whether there are alternative and more effi-
cient ways to organize the employment agency's offices and
employment officers' work tasks. Another area of investiga-
tion should focus on the ways in which immigrants resist the
employment agency. How do unemployed immigrants
express their exclusion from the labor market? How do they
resist employment officers' advice? Also, in consideration of
technological advances such as computerization, robotiza-
tion, and outsourcing, it could be worthwhile to investigate
the transformation of work and its future consequences for
those who are the most affected by unemployment, for exam-
ple, immigrants and women. Will further technological
advances make it easier or harder for immigrants to enter the
labor market?
Finally, with new public management having been in
practice for three decades, it has become more and more
obvious that it has not been the success that politicians had
hoped for. With regard to labor market policies and the inte-
gration of immigrants, the question is whether it is not time
to reevaluate the efficiency of the market-based reforms. A
recent survey (Holmberg & Sommerstein, 2013) of Swedes'
confidence in public institutions showed, for instance, that
the PESA ranked as the least successful performer. One of
the factors contributing to this crisis of confidence may be
the fact that the implementation of market-based reforms has
Moulettes 11
left the employment officers with too much power to steer
and control the unemployed and too little power for the latter
to decide on their own lives. Perhaps this is an indicator that
the time has come to take Denhardt and Denhardt's (2006)
suggestion into consideration and implement a more service-
minded model based on negotiations, dialogue, and responsi-
bility that is shared between the PESA and the unemployed
job seekers.
