Introduction
Obesity ­ an excessive accumulation of body fat ­ is the
most prevalent, chronic medical condition across the
world.1 It poses a great threat to renal health and is an inde-
pendent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases,2 as well as
influencing the functions of the endocrine system.3
Moreover, central obesity is particularly associated with an
increase of general mortality.4 It is well documented that
obesity is a multifactorial disorder involving the interaction
of genetic and environmental factors.5 To date, a few puta-
tive major genes for human obesity have been identified, it
is speculated that a number of minor genes involved in the
process of adipogenesis or in the regulation of adipocyte
metabolism may also result in susceptibility to obesity.6
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in
adipocyte growth and function and the ACE-processed
angiotensin II inhibits adipocyte differentiation.7 A poly-
morphism has been identified in intron 16 in which a 287
base-pair alu sequence was found to be present (insertion
or I) or absent (deletion or D) in the population.8
A meta-analysis by Xi et al.9 showed that ACE I/D gene
polymorphism was closely associated with susceptibility to
metabolic syndrome, a disorder closely associated with
central obesity. In addition, an association of body mass
index (BMI) with ACE I/D gene polymorphism was
obtained in a Tunisian population.10 In this sense, it is rea-
sonable to postulate that ACE I/D gene polymorphism may

Abstract
Background and objective: The association between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D)
gene polymorphism and the risk of overweight/obesity remains controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate
the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity susceptibility.
Method: All eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases
through April 2013 according to a predefined criteria.
Results: Fourteen case-control studies including 3371 cases and 4490 controls were recruited for the analysis of the
association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity susceptibility. A significant association was
observed between DD genotype and overweight/obesity risk in overall populations and Africans (p=0.014 and 0.010,
respectively). D allele was associated with the risk of overweight/ obesity in Africans (p=0.026). However, II genotype
might not be a protective factor against overweight/obesity risk in overall populations, Africans, Caucasians and Asians.
Conclusions: DD genotype is a risk factor for the overweight/obesity susceptibility in overall populations, particularly
in Africans. D allele is a risk factor for the overweight/obesity susceptibility in Africans. Further larger studies are needed
to confirm our findings.

be associated with susceptibility to overweight/obesity.
However, a number of investigations regarding the associa-
tion between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/
obesity risk have generated mixed results in human stud-
ies.5,8,10-21 The contribution of ACE I/D gene polymorphism
to the onset of overweight/
obesity is still unclear. Meta-
analysis of the association betweenACE I/D gene polymor-
phism and overweight/obesity risk is rare. Thus, we
performed this meta-analysis to investigate the association
between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight /
obesity susceptibility with the aim of providing a much
more reliable finding on the significance of this issue.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
We searched the published literature through April 2013 for
related studies that investigated the association between
ACE I/D gene polymorphism and the risk of overweight/
obesity using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases.
The search in PubMed or Embase was limited to English
language. The followings were search terms: (1) over-
weight, obesity, and central obesity; and (2) angiotensin-
converting enzyme, insertion/deletion, ACE I/D, and gene
polymorphism. We also reviewed the reference lists of
retrieved articles and reviews. If multiple publications of
the same subjects occurred, we recruited the study with the
most complete analysis.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: (1) case-control study; (2) the outcome
of interest was overweight/obesity; (3) at least two com-
parison groups (overweight/obesity group vs. control
group). Exclusion criteria: (1) case reports, editorials and
reviews; (2) relationship between other genes and over-
weight/obesity risk; (3) multiple publications of the same
data; and (4) study of the role of ACE I/D in diseases.
Data extraction and synthesis
Characteristics for each study were extracted and data were
recorded as follows: first author's surname, year of publica-
tion, ethnicity of study population, number of cases and
controls for ACE I/D genotype. Frequencies of D allele
were computed for case and control groups from the cor-
responding genotype distribution. Two authors indepen-
dently conducted the data extraction and synthesis, with
any disagreements resolved by discussion.
Statistical analysis
Odds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of the association
between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obe-
sity risk across studies. Heterogeneity of ORs among stud-
ies was tested by using the Q statistic (significance level at
p<0.05). The I2 statistic, a quantitative measure of incon-
sistency across studies, was also calculated. The pooled
ORs were computed using either fixed-effects model or, in
the presence of heterogeneity, random-effects model.
Moreover, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also com-
puted. In order to avoid excessive comparisons, the OR was
calculated using three methods: method 1, allele compari-
son (D allele vs. I allele); method 2, comparing DD
homozygous with the other two combinations (DD vs.
DI+II); and method 3, comparing II genotype with the other
two combinations (II vs. DI+DD). A chi-square test using a
web-based program was used to determine whether geno-
type distribution of the control population reported con-
formed to Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (HWE
significance level at p<0.05). A sensitivity analysis was
conducted when studies with controls did not conform to
HWE, or HWE was not available due to the lack of data.
Potential publication bias was assessed by Begg's test and
Egger's test (p<0.05 was considered significant) when the
number of the studies included was more than 10. All anal-
yses were conducted using STATA version 12.0 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX); p<0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant, except where otherwise specified.
Results
Study characteristics
We initially extracted 526 unique references from the
PubMed (424), Embase (76) and Cochrane databases (26).
Of these, 512 publications were excluded according to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen articles were
included in our analysis for the association between
ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity risk
(Figure 1). Seven5,8,12,14,15,17,19 studies were conducted in
Asians, five11,13,16,20,21 in Caucasians, and two10,18 inAfricans
(oneinContinentalAfricans10 andoneinAfro-Caribbeans18).
All papers were published in English. The extracted data
were recorded as follows: first author's surname, publica-
tion year and the number of cases and controls (Table 1).
These 14 studies included 3371 cases and 4490 controls.
The average frequency of the D allele was 57.38% in
Caucasian patients and 55.38% in controls. For Asians, the
average frequency of the D allele was 58.99% in the case
group and 46.82% for controls. For Africans, the average
frequency of the D allele was 64.84% in the case group and
57.68% for controls. The ratio of cases/controls for average
frequency of the D allele in Asians was higher compared
with that in Africans and Caucasians (Asians: cases/ con-
trols=1.26; Africans: cases/ controls=1.12; Caucasians:
cases/ controls=1.04).
Association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism
with overweight/obesity risk
In this meta-analysis, a significant association between DD
genotype and overweight /obesity risk was observed in
Mao and Huang 689
overall populations (p=0.014; Figure 2; Table 2), whereas
D allele was not associated with the risk of overweight/obe-
sity (p=0.132; Table 2). In the subgroup analysis, DD
genotype/D allele was associated with susceptibility to
overweight/obesity in Africans (DD genotype: p=0.01, D
allele=0.026; Figures 3 and 4; Table 2). Moreover, DD
genotype/D allele was not associated with the risk of over-
weight/obesity in Caucasians and Asians (Table 2). II geno-
type might not be a protective factor against overweight/
obesity risk in overall populations, Africans, Caucasians
and Asians (Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis
Two studies5,16 in which detailed numbers of DD, DI or II
genotypes in the control groups were not available were
excluded; the genotype distributions of the control groups
in the remaining studies were all in HWE. Therefore, we
included 12 studies8,10-15,17-21 in the sensitivity analysis.
For overall populations, similar results were found in the
sensitivity analysis compared with those in the non-
sensitivity analysis. DD genotype was significantly associ-
ated with overweight/obesity risk in overall populations.
For Africans, the results from sensitivity analysis were
similar to those from the non-sensitivity analysis.
Significant associations were observed between DD
genotype/D allele and the risk of overweight/obesity in
Africans. Moreover, for Caucasians and Asians, the results
from sensitivity analysis were similar to those from the
non-sensitivity analysis. II genotype might not play a pro-
tective role against overweight/obesity risk in overall popu-
lations, Africans, Caucasians and Asians, which were
similar to those from the non-sensitivity analysis (Table 2).
Evaluation of publication bias
There was no significant publication bias for overall popu-
lations (D vs. I: Begg p=0.360, Egger p=0.182; DD vs.
DI+II: Begg p=0.855, Egger p=0.535; II vs. DI+DD: Begg
p=1.000, Egger p=0.724).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess
the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and
overweight/obesity risk. We observed that the DD genotype
was associated with the development of overweight/obesity
in overall populations, and the results from the sensitivity

analysis were similar to those from the non-sensitivity anal-
ysis. No publication bias for overall populations was
observed. All these indicated the results for overall popula-
tions were robust.
Ethnic differences might affect the association between
ACE I/D gene polymorphism and overweight/obesity risk.
In our study, the ratio of cases/controls for average fre-
quency of the D allele was 1.26, 1.12 and 1.04 in Asians,

Africans and Caucasians, respectively. Of note, the ratio in
Asians was the highest, whereas no significant association
between D allele/DD genotype and overweight/obesity risk
was observed in Asians. This was mainly because of the
study by Yang et al.,5 in which the HWE was not available;
the ratio would be 1.00 if this study was excluded. In
Africans, we found that the D allele and DD genotype were
associated with susceptibility to overweight/obesity, and

the results from the sensitivity analysis were similar to
those from the non-sensitivity analysis. However, there
were only two studies included for the meta-analysis in
Africans, which made it difficult to draw a robust conclu-
sion for Africans. More studies in Africans are needed for a
robust result. We also found that II genotype seemed not to
play a protective role against the risk of overweight/ obe-
sity in overall populations, Africans, Caucasians and
Asians.
Several factors may account for our findings regarding
the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and
overweight/obesity risk. First, the renin­angiotensin sys-
tem (RAS) has been hypothesized to inhibit adipogenesis,22
which limits the storage capacity of adipose tissues and
allows ectopic lipid storage that results in lipotoxicity. ACE
is expressed in adipose tissue, which indicates that ACE
may be involved in adipocyte growth and metabolism
resulting in the regulation of obesity-related traits.23
Angiotensin II, the major effector of RAS, inhibits adipo-
cyte differentiation and promotes myocytic lipid deposi-
tion.24 Moreover, angiotensin receptor blockers activate
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma
activity and adiponectin secretion.25 Second, ACE I/D gene
polymorphism may be a major determinant of serum ACE
levels.26 Serum ACE levels are markedly higher in the DD
genotype than those in the DI or in II genotype; the number
of the D allele corresponds to increasing concentrations of
serum ACE,27 consistent with our results that the DD geno-
type was associated with overweight/obesity risk in overall
populations and Africans, and the D allele was associated
with the susceptibility to overweight/obesity in Africans.
Third, as many genes and polymorphisms contribute to
RAS activity, the interaction between ACE I/D gene poly-
morphism and other functional sequence variants might
affect the results.28 Finally, comorbidities, gender, and
ethnic background may affect the results. For example, one
study by Settin et al.8 showed that there was no marked
association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and non-
complicated overweight/obesity risk, and two studies5,20
demonstrated that the association between ACE I/D gene
polymorphism and overweight/obesity risk was gender
dependent. All these prove at least the existence of other
factors affecting the role of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in
the onset of overweight/obesity, which offers an insight
into investigating the association between ACE I/D gene
polymorphism and overweight/obesity risk in different
populations.
There have been a number of meta-analyses and studies
reporting the association between ACE I/D gene polymor-
phism and the risk of obesity-related diseases. A meta-
analysis by Xi et al.9 reported that the D allele was
associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome. A meta-
analysis by Li29 showed that the D allele was linked with
essential hypertension in the whole Chinese population. A
meta-analysis by Niu et al.30 showed that the D allele was
associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. One study
by Celik et al.31 showed that the DD genotype was associ-
ated with an increased insulin resistance in women with
polycystic ovary syndrome. A study by You et al.32 showed
that the D allele was closely associated with reduced high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A study by Passaro
et al.33 showed that a gene interaction existed between
PPAR-2 and ACE I/D polymorphism on BMI and fat
mass. These previous findings strongly suggest that ACE
I/D gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of disor-
ders related to overweight/obesity.
In our meta-analysis, we found that DD genotype was
associated with the risk of overweight/obesity in overall pop-
ulations and Africans. The D allele was correlated with over-
weight/obesity risk in Africans. However, these findings

should be interpreted with caution; first, heterogeneities
across studies included might affect the results of our meta-
analysis, although a random-effects model had been con-
ducted. Second, the variable study designs and small sample
size limited the statistical power. Third, although the defini-
tion of overweight/obesity in the majority of included studies
is >25kg/m2, some studies13,15,16 also used waist circumfer-
ence and serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol or low-
density lipoprotein as standards of overweight/obesity. The
relationship between these factors and genotype and pheno-
type merits attention. For example, Passaro et al.33 reported
that ACE DD subjects had a higher BMI and fat mass. Min
et al.34 reported that ACE II genotype was associated with a
higher blood pressure. Kotaska et al.35 reported that the ACE
D allele was the most frequent genetic variant in risk groups
of dyslipidemic patients. Borzyszkowska et al.36 reported
that ACE DD genotype carriers had higher total cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Meta-regression analysis was
unavailable due to the limited data. More association studies
should be performed in the future. Finally, the interaction
between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and other loci
involved in the development of overweight/obesity might be
present.
In conclusion, DD genotype is a risk factor for suscepti-
bility to overweight/ obesity in overall populations and
Africans. The D allele is a risk factor for susceptibility to
overweight/obesity in Africans. The II genotype might not
be a protective factor against the overweight/obesity risk in
overall populations, Africans, Caucasians and Asians.
However, more case-control studies are needed to elucidate
the role ofACE I/D gene polymorphism in overweight/obe-
sity risk in different populations.
