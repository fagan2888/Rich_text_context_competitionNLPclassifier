Abstract: Although there is general consensus that growth in the prison population should be
reversed, there is little agreement on how to achieve this goal. In this paper, I apply classic
demographic methods to answer questions that assess the strategies, complexities, and realities
of routes to zero and negative prison population growth. Modified admissions policies have had the
greatest impact on halting growth, whereas decreasing the length of sentences has had only a modest,
short-term influence on the prison population size. As state and federal policy-makers consider
reducing sentences for selective classes of nonviolent offenders, it is important that they have a holistic
understanding of the implications of such policies. Traditionally, this type of modification has been
coupled with more punitive policies for violent offenders, a pattern that reinforces the appearance of
having "tough on crime" policies. Model estimates show that such strategies countervail the overall
goal of decreasing the size of the prison population. Regardless of underlying reasons to halt growth
of the prison populations, integration of the formal demography enable a means to assess the short-
and long-term consequences of current and future policy.

1. Introduction
Incarceration has been the primary mode of punishment used in the United States. Yet since the
2008 economic crisis, the conversation has shifted to decreasing the size of the U.S. prison population
via legislation. Ironically, both political parties had a hand in creating this state of mass incarceration.
Both parties pushed policies to get "tough on crime" and wage the "War on Drugs"; beginning with
Lyndon Johnson, each president has made crime a campaign issue, one they promised to tackle.
A major shift is at last occurring, and there is widespread agreement that there is a need for change.
While Democrats and Republicans agree that something must change, their stances differ, and the most
effective way(s) to address the problems associated with mass incarceration remain unclear. As stated
in the New York Times:
The debate over how to reverse this [problem] breaks down among those who favor
broad changes to sentences, including the reduction of mandatory minimum sentences,
those who want to address early release and services behind bars, and those who favor
a blended approach (Steinhauer 2015).
While one party argues to eliminate incarceration for some crimes and replace it with fines, warnings,
drug treatment, etc., the other argues for more effective rehabilitation programs inside the prison walls,
such as opportunities for inmates to advance their education. In this paper, I argue: (1) a methodological
examination of punishment informed by population dynamics is necessary to understand how and
why the U.S. leads the world in the size of its prison population, which will help illuminate the
complexity of the punishment problem; (2) formal demography provides unique tools to evaluate the

costs and effectiveness of policies proposed or in current use to slow, stop, and lower the size of the
prison population.
1.1. The Case for Demography
Since the 2008 economic crisis, there has been a growing bipartisan trend to look for ways to
decrease the size of the U.S. prison population without sacrificing the quality of criminal justice.
The current overpopulation of the nation's prisons and jails is forcing states to seek ways to slow,
stop, or reduce the number of people behind bars. Generally, there are four fronts for categorizing
current efforts to reduce the U.S. prison population (Porter 2015). First, many states have focused
on sentencing reforms, often through the reclassification of offenses from a felony to a misdemeanor
for some nonviolent crimes. Second, some states reroute those found guilty of low-level offenses
from prison to rehabilitation programs, probation, community service, or some other alternative to
incarceration. A third option has been to decriminalize certain offenses, rendering the associated
punishments to fines. Finally, some efforts have gone towards addressing the consequences of
having a criminal record in the hopes of reducing rates of recidivism such as "ban the box" efforts
in some cities, which make it illegal for employers to ask about criminal records on job applications.
Each of these four approaches are more or less time-bound with different consequences for the
size, composition, and overall cost of imprisonment. We can think of them in terms of their focus:
sentencing, alternatives to incarceration, decriminalization, and reducing reentry. However, if the
goal is to reduce the U.S. prison population in the long-run, it means moving beyond study of the
web of social problems created by current practices (Braman 2004; Bushway 2004; Patterson 2013;
Patterson and Wildeman 2015; Travis et al. 2014; Visher and Travis 2003; Western 2002). It requires
making population informed policies and legislation that integrate the complex population dynamics
that characterize prison populations.
Demography, which is the study of how and why populations change, provides tools and
techniques to assist in formulating viable plans. For example, a similar question has circulated for
centuries regarding the world's exploding population. Population changes are brought about by
births, deaths, and migration. While changes in a population's mortality tend to take time, women
can control their fertility and decide what number of children they bear. China is one example where
knowledge of how populations grow helped to stabilize the size of the population. In the mid-twentieth
century, rapid population growth occurred in China because the death rate declined while fertility
rates remained the same, which resulted in a 60 percent population increase in just 20 years
(Hesketh et al. 2005). In 1979, China's State Family Planning Bureau used demographic techniques
including population projections and momentum to retard the population growth. Other nations
have turned to demography to address other population issues. For instance, many West European
countries have encouraged immigration from their former colonies to offset negative population
growth (Lutz and Scherbov 2002).
As of 2015, the U.S. had the world's highest number of people incarcerated (International Centre
for Prison Studies 2017). Just as demography has shed light on country-level population dynamics,
it also can offer insights into how various policies affect prison populations. In this paper, I explore
the routes states could follow to reduce the United States' massive prison population and rates of
incarceration. Employing demography to advance understanding of the growth and decline of the
country's prison population adds a meaningful dimension to the assessment and implementation of
policies. Using admission and release data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, I apply two classic
demographic questions to the prison population: Given a set of policies, how long will it take to reach
zero population growth? What strategies will provide the shortest route to zero or negative growth?
1.2. Strategies to Zero Prison Population Growth
The demography literature establishes that even if a population holds its mortality schedule
constant (age-specific death rates), altering the fertility schedule (age-specific fertility rates) will
Soc. Sci. 2017, 6, 60 3 of 13
have a significant impact on the future size of the population (Demeny 1988; Pritchett 1994).
Analogously, adjusting prison entrance rates should have an effect on the size of the prison
population, yet few studies have incorporated knowledge about both entrance and exit dynamics.
(Austin and Krisberg 1985) utilized national data to show that despite the projected national trend
of the prison population leveling out, the population would continue to rise, due to momentum.
Their paper established three options to curb the predicted growth in the prison population: change
the entrance schedule (number of admissions each year), change the release schedule, or expand prison
capacity. Their analyses suggested that policy reforms at that time were encouraging growth in the
prison population, thereby making the third option, prison expansion, inevitable. Using Minnesota
as an example, Knapp and Anderson (1981) proposed a similar use of simulations to determine the
impact of policies, which resulted in similar conclusions.
These previous works have certainly been instrumental in developing a dialogue around how
to address the growth of the U.S. prison population. Scholars and policymakers have continued
the conversation, which has surfaced a series of questions: How should we model the prison
population? What is the relationship between incarceration and sentencing policies? How do we create
effective policies that do not compromise public safety? What is the route to zero (or negative) prison
population growth?
Recent work has focused on the causes of massive growth in the U.S. prison population and
proposed ways to deal with the issue. However, some make recommendations based on policies of
the past, which may fall short due to changes in the overall context of the U.S. (Austin 2010) reminds
us that we were once a nation with a rather stable rate of crime and incarceration. In fact, the current
crime rate is approximately the same as it was in 1969, when the prison population experienced its
last decline (Travis et al. 2014). Austin proposes returning to the sentencing regime that was in place
at that turning point. Taking a historical view, other things going on at that time--for example, the
civil rights movement and its opposition to Jim Crow laws--might lead one to think that today's
incarceration rates should be even lower. Returning to the earlier sentencing regime is a reasonable
goal, but, navigating the path to reach that goal might be difficult. Tonry (2014) provided a ten-step
blueprint for moving beyond our current state of mass incarceration. Each step involves amending or
ending policies related to sentencing practices that some argue have led us to the current situation.
This could be part of the solution, but other studies show that we cannot move past mass incarceration
if our main punitive instrument is incarceration.
Other work has established that prison admissions matter (Pfaff 2008; Pfaff 2011; Raphael 2009)
and, along with current policy initiatives, stresses the need for change in both admissions and
sentencing policies. Similarly, this paper considers changes that impact admissions and/or exits
via sentencing, but also provides a nuanced understanding of how long it takes to see changes
in the prison population after implementation and the monetary costs associated with the change.
Most importantly, in this paper I demonstrate the power cohort-component population projections
bring to thinking through and understanding the impact of policy changes. A strength of this method
is that it integrates knowledge of past and current policies and the resulting population structure of
such policies. This enables one to not only ascertain if new policies will meet the goals of slowing or
decreasing the prison population, but it also distinguishes how long the momentum of past policies
will influence the growth. Finally, most current initiatives focus on the non-violent inmate population;
however inmates sentenced for violent crimes must be considered even if the policies focus only on
some non-violent offenses. Therefore, I demonstrate how demographic tools integrate this critical
information to create population informed approaches to the path of zero, or even negative, growth in
the prison population.
1.3. Examples of Recent Policy Reforms
Before describing the modeling procedures I used in this paper, it makes sense to provide more
detail about some of the recent reforms states have proposed and/or implemented to address the size
Soc. Sci. 2017, 6, 60 4 of 13
and growth of their prison populations. I specifically turn to a report published by The Sentencing
Project, "The State of Sentencing 2014: Developments in Policy and Practice," which provides timely
examples (Porter 2015). Most reforms affecting adults can be grouped into four categories:
(1) Reducing the length of sentence and/or reclassification (from felony to misdemeanor) for some
nonviolent crimes. Many states have made changes to sentencing practices. Six offenses were
reclassified in California, including shoplifting, from a felony to a misdemeanor. Other states,
including New Hampshire and Tennessee, now offer additional opportunities for inmates to
reduce the time served for certain offenses.
(2) Rerouting people who commit low-level offenses and/or violate their probation or parole from
prison to rehabilitation, probation, community service, or other alternatives to incarceration.
In Missouri, for example, people who commit misdemeanors classified at the lowest level are no
longer subject to incarceration.
(3) Decriminalizing certain offenses. For example, Alaska and Oregon have decriminalized the
possession of some quantity of marijuana for recreational purposes. In Maryland and the District
of Columbia, the penalty for possessing a limited amount of marijuana has been reduced to a fine.
(4) Addressing the consequences of having a criminal record, such as ineligibility for some types
of financial aid and/or government assistance, difficulty finding legitimate employment,
and difficulty finding appropriate housing. Several states--Delaware, Illinois, Nebraska, and New
Jersey--and the District of Columbia have implemented "ban the box" policies to help end
employment discrimination against people with a criminal record. In 2014, California and
Missouri made great strides toward successful reintegration by removing restrictions on
former inmates with a drug felony record, thus enabling them to receive financial aid and
public assistance.
Each of these four broad approaches has different short- and long-term implications for the size,
composition, and cost of the nation's prison population. Based on the population and the policy
literature reviewed above, the strategies with the most promise are those that include policies that
reduce the number of new admissions and/or recidivism. Each strategy above tackles at least one of
the fronts except the first strategy, which focuses on reducing the sentence length. In the next section,
I describe the demographic tools necessary to assess the potential benefits and deficiencies of each of
the strategies.
2. Data and Methodology
The prison population, like any population, can grow, decline, or remain the same size.
A population that is growing or declining at a constant rate, r, is known as a stable population.
When r = 0, it is a special case of the stable population, known as the stationary population. A stationary
population meets three conditions: (1) it has a growth rate of zero; (2) it has the same number of yearly
admissions and releases; (3) the rate of net migration is zero. Such characteristics occur when the
same admissions rates and release rates have been in place for a sufficient amount of time. Because
it takes time for the momentum of past policies to no longer influence the characteristics of the total
population, implementation of policies that keep the yearly admissions the same and adhere to the
same release schedule do not typically yield a stationary population immediately. For example, we can
put into practice a set of policies such that all new admissions adhere to conditions that characterize
a stationary population. However, the size of the current prison population is the result of years of
admissions under a variety of policies. Thus, the total prison population is a combination of the current
and past regimes. Until the inmates from the former regime exit, they will influence the underlying
structure and release schedule of the prison population.

2.1. Data
In this paper, I utilized national-level data from 2004 to demonstrate the capacity for states and
agencies to make informed sentencing decisions. Although a notable amount of time has passed since
2004, the timing of the data used in this paper is not relevant to its purpose--i.e., to show the short-
and long-term consequences of policy reforms--or to the results. Correctional data from any time in
the era of mass incarceration can be used to demonstrate the challenges and possibilities of different
policies. Estimates from this data reflect a time when the incarceration population had not yet peaked;
in comparison to current trends, the resulting simulations should roughly mirror changes for persons
incarcerated for non-violent offenses and are conservative of the changes for persons incarcerated
for violent offenses. Further, this year is prior to the economic crisis that prompted discussions and
legislation with the goal of lowering the prison population.
Several steps were needed to move from the raw data to determine the short- and long-term
consequences of policy changes. The first step was to calculate the 2004 duration-specific release rates,
where the numerator was the number of releases and the denominator an estimate of person-years
lived (or rather prison-years lived), for a duration category. The numerator for each duration-specific
release rate came from National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) release files, which provide
comprehensive records of releases from state correctional facilities for 2004 that include information
such as age, sex, education, race, state, ethnicity, length of stay, and the offense that led to incarceration.
These data are not comprehensive at the national level, as they are limited to the states that choose to
report in any given year. For this analysis, I used data from 33 states that reported release information
during the 2004 calendar year.1
The denominator of the duration-specific release rates required an estimate of prison years lived
for each duration category; here, the mid-year population in 2004 was used as the estimate of prison
years lived. I initially chose this year because it is the year of the last Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, which was the only way to estimate the denominator for the duration-specific
release rates until recently. However, beginning with the 2005 data, the NCRP added a file that
provides year-end counts of the correctional populations by state. Combining the year-end counts
with the admissions and release files allowed an estimate to be made of the mid-year population for
2004 by duration, thereby allowing the computation of the duration-specific release rates. Although
the data available eliminated the use of Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities, performing
this analysis using the year 2004 still provides the same insights because it represents the era of mass
incarceration, and the majority of states had not experienced a decline in their prison population.
2.2. The Cohort Component Method and Simulating the Impact of Policies
I used the cohort-component method to determine the implications of policies on the future
prison population (for more details, see (Preston et al. 2001)). This approach uses a discrete-time
model and incorporates the current duration distribution and release schedule of the prison population
in its projections (i.e., the influence of the past sentencing regimes). The projections are calculated
at the duration level to incorporate the difference in the rates of release from prison by duration.
This piece is important because the release rates are not uniform. Rather, the release rates are high
initially. The release rates decline as the duration of stay increases because longer stays indicate the
commission of more serious crimes, which are typically accompanied by harsher sentencing. For the
prison population, an interval length of six months was sufficient to incorporate differences in release
rates from prison by duration of stay. In sum, use of the cohort component projection allows integration

Virginia, and Wisconsin.
Soc. Sci. 2017, 6, 60 6 of 13
of the underlying structure of the prison population and the release schedule. In addition, this method
enables one the ability to impose changes to the future growth in admissions and release schedules
without ignoring the past and current underlying structure of the prison population.
The simulation of changes resulting from policy involved several parameters: the number of
annual admissions, the growth rate of admissions, the duration-specific release rates, and current
prison population disaggregated by duration. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics that pertain
to state-specific admissions allowed calculation of the admissions growth rate, where nine years of
data were used to provide a reliable estimate. In addition to knowledge of the current conditions,
I used hypothetical parameters to reflect some of the current strategies for slowing and lowering the
size of the prison population. The cohort component projections provided a comparison between the
volume of the prison population if conditions remained the same and the if there was an immediate
change in the sentencing, number of admissions, and/or growth rate of admissions that lasted for fifty
years. Thus, the projected population combines the sentencing regimes of the past and the population
produced by the new policies to depict the influence of newly imposed conditions. Below I provide
the main steps necessary to produce the needed output (for more information on this method, please
see (Preston et al. 2001).
2.3. Input Variables
Current Population. This is the current population of the correctional population stratified by
type of crime (violent vs. non-violent) and organized by the duration of time served for current stay.
The length of the interval for each duration category is six months. For example, the first interval is
zero to five months (where five months is considered the time up to the beginning of the sixth month),
the second is 6 to 11 months, and so forth.
Current Duration-Specific Release Rates. The current duration-specific release rates requires
partitioning the releases and current population by violent vs. non-violent. The number of releases
in each duration category forms the numerator of the duration-specific release rate and excludes
releases categorized as deaths, escapes, and transfers. The denominator makes use of the midyear
population partitioned by type of offense and the appropriate duration category. The current
duration-specific release rates are the quotients of the duration-specific releases and duration-specific
mid-year population.
Current Growth Rate. The instantaneous growth rate, r, can be expressed as:
lim
t
 N(t)
N(t)t
=
d N(t)
dt
N(t)
=
d ln[N(t]
dt
(1)
Through a series of equations, we can derive the following as an expression of the mean annualized
growth rate:
r[0, T] =
ln N(T)
N(0)
T
(2)
In other words, the mean annualized growth rate used was the natural log of the quotient of the
number of admissions in 2009 and the number of admissions in 2000 divided by the length of the
interval, which was nine years. In the middle of the nine-year period is the point of interest in this
analysis to capture an overall steady rate.
Only three states exhibited negative growth rates during the nine year period: New Jersey,
New York, and Kansas between 2000 and 2009 (based on authors calculations of data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics). All other states experienced positive growth rates, with growth rates as high as
0.06 (West Virginia), accompanied by a standard error of 0.027. Rhode Island had the highest level
of standard error at 0.263, and a growth rate of 0.033. The range of growth rates and standard errors
indicate the erratic nature of prison growth and reflect variations in state policies.
Soc. Sci. 2017, 6, 60 7 of 13
Changes. The last input variables allow changes to the growth rate in admissions, the initial
number of admissions for the projections, and the sentencing via changes in the duration-specific
release rates. The changes stay in place for 50 years.
2.4. Cohort-Component Mechanics
To determine the short and long term consequences of changes, at least two population processes
had to occur. The current population continued to be subjected to the duration-specific release rates,
and the incoming populations were subjected to the parameters detailed above. The summing of
the two populations provided the total population. For most of the scenarios, changes were made
to people committing non-violent offenses. To advance the populations, several calculations were
necessary. The most important calculation was the survival ratio, based on the nLx column of the life
table. Here, the subscript n indicates the length of the interval and the subscript, x, indicates the starting
duration of the interval. Thus, we could change this to more accurately reflect the partitioning of the
prison population by changing the n to a six. In the human population, this column tells us the total
number of years contributed by people the age category depicted by the subscripts. The summation
of this column divided by the radix of the life table (the number of people in the synthetic cohort)
provides us life expectancy at birth, or the average number of years a newborn could expect to live
if he/she was subjected to the current mortality schedule. In the prison population, the analogous
measure to life expectancy is the mean length of stay.
The survivor ratio is the ratio of people who survive from one duration category to the next.
The survivor ratio can be expressed, 6Lx/6Lx-6. Projecting the population forward, then, is simply
the product of the population in duration x-6 and the survivorship ratio. The calculation is slightly
different for the first duration interval, zero to five. Here, we utilize the number of admissions,
b, (which can change yearly by some growth rate) and 6L0. The population size for that category can be
expressed as b*(6L0/(0.5*l0)), where, l0, is the radix of the life table. Thus, for each of the simulations,
there is an underlying assumption of a fixed growth rate in admissions and release schedule. Further,
the release schedule of the current population remains in place for the population already imprisoned.
Only new admissions are subjected to the changes. It would be relatively easy to insert variance into
the growth rate in admissions and/or the change in the release schedule. However, this was not done
for the sake of ease in understanding the short and long-term changes to the overall prison population
by potential alterations to criminal policy.
2.5. Estimating the Costs of Zero Prison Population Growth
In this paper, I made use of other formal demographic concepts, primarily prison years lived,
to estimate the costs of each of the policies explored. Most of the strategies required some time for
zero prison population growth to occur. I estimated the costs once zero growth occurred, which is
simply taking the total population at zero growth and multiplying it by the costs for each inmate.
I also estimated the costs from the implementation of the policy through zero growth. Here is where
the concept of prison years lived is especially helpful. The size of the prison population changes over
time. Between two points in time, there are people who enter, people who leave, and people who
are there the entire time. The estimation of prison-years lived allows one to take the entries and exits
into account, such that people who enter or leave prison half-way through the year only contribute to
the costs for half of that year (and any additional time from prior years). The product of the cost per
year to house a person in a state correctional facility and the person-years lived in prison yielded the
total cost of each intervention from implementation through zero population growth. The costs of the
different policy interventions were compared to the cost if all parameters remained the same.

3. Results
3.1. Modeling Changes for Individuals Incarcerated for Nonviolent Offenses
Most policy initiatives directed at changing the prison population have focused on people
found guilty of nonviolent offenses. The actions taken range from diversion programs to changes in
sentencing structure. I demonstrate the implications of each of the four policy shifts discussed above
and model how they affect the overall prison size over time. In other words, I model what one might
expect to see, given the approaches laid out in the prior section. Let us first consider four possible
changes in sentencing the nonviolent inmate population:
(1) Examine the impact of lowering the average sentence by 20%. This translates into changing the
length of sentence for people who commit nonviolent crimes.
(2) Examine what happens if zero growth in admissions is achieved. This means admissions would
be the same from year to year. Policy changes such as using alternatives to incarceration for
some offenses might lead to this result. For example, if the year to year variation in admissions
resulted from drug offenses, rerouting this group to drug courts where the penalties consisted of
probation and/or some type of rehabilitation and life skills workshops would make the number
of admissions to prison stationary year to year.
(3) Implement an immediate 25% decrease in admissions and then hold that level constant. One way
to achieve this is to decriminalize the possession/use of marijuana, within reason, and to provide
alternatives to incarceration for some other nonviolent offenses.
(4) Observe the results of a constant yearly decline in admissions. This could be achieved by reducing
the barriers to former inmates' reintegration into society. Many argue that these barriers are
responsible for the high recidivism in the U.S. The prior section provided examples of how states
are trying to ameliorate the impact of having a criminal record.
Figure 1 displays the size of the nonviolent population that results from implementing the four
changes delimited above. The graph shows each of these changes, as well as what happens when
the current regime remains constant, which is represented by the solid black line. The line with the
circle-dash pattern represents the change resulting from reducing the length of sentences; it shows
an initial decline, soon followed by growth. The policies with some promise are those that make changes
in admissions policies. The line made of dashes shows what happens when there is zero growth in
admissions. The line with the dash-dot sequence shows what happens when there is an immediate
decline in admissions, followed by no growth in admissions. The last line, the square-dash pattern,
shows a constant rate of decline in admissions.

We also must also consider people incarcerated for violent offenses. Figure 2 shows what
happens when people who are in correctional facilities because of violent crimes are included. Given
that we typically do not see policy changes that reduce the population of violent offenders, Figure 2
presents a population projection that allows the current sentencing and growth patterns for violent
offenders to continue. It shows that, even if zero and negative growth can be achieved for one portion
of the prison population, it will not result in zero or negative growth overall. This is because, although
people incarcerated for committing nonviolent crimes make up a higher percentage of prison

population, it will not result in zero or negative growth overall. This is because, although people
incarcerated for committing nonviolent crimes make up a higher percentage of prison admissions and
releases, their very short stay makes their presence less influential. That is, those who are incarcerated
longer maintain the size of the population.

Ultimately, we cannot escape the policies of the past, an idea known as population momentum.
The sentencing practices of the past influence the size of the current prison population, and
immediate change is not possible unless there is something to counteract the momentum. Based on
this first exercise, which examined the impact of four changes to the current sentencing regime,
several implications are possible. Policy changes for nonviolent offenses have little effect because of
the low mean length of stay for these crimes. Compensating for less punishment for nonviolent
offenses by giving harsher sentences for violent offenses increases growth of the prison population.
Policymakers must consider the momentum of past policies, particularly the longer sentences
attached to violent crimes.
3.2. The Costs of Momentum
Reaching and maintaining zero population growth is heavily dependent on the movements of
people charged with and sanctioned for violent offenses. Although public safety certainly cannot be
ignored, this population is not part of this discussion of changes, unless a change involves more
punitive policies. However, there is no reason to increase the current level of punishment for people
committing violent crimes; I argue, rather, that the only way to sustain a lack of growth or negative
growth in the prison population is to implement policies that continue to lower the rate of violent
crimes committed. Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same
policies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of
admissions for violent offenders remains constant over time.

Ultimately, we cannot escape the policies of the past, an idea known as population momentum.
The sentencing practices of the past influence the size of the current prison population, and immediate
change is not possible unless there is something to counteract the momentum. Based on this first
exercise, which examined the impact of four changes to the current sentencing regime, several
implications are possible. Policy changes for nonviolent offenses have little effect because of the
low mean length of stay for these crimes. Compensating for less punishment for nonviolent
offenses by giving harsher sentences for violent offenses increases growth of the prison population.
Policymakers must consider the momentum of past policies, particularly the longer sentences attached
to violent crimes.
3.2. The Costs of Momentum
Reaching and maintaining zero population growth is heavily dependent on the movements of
people charged with and sanctioned for violent offenses. Although public safety certainly cannot
be ignored, this population is not part of this discussion of changes, unless a change involves more
punitive policies. However, there is no reason to increase the current level of punishment for people
committing violent crimes; I argue, rather, that the only way to sustain a lack of growth or negative
growth in the prison population is to implement policies that continue to lower the rate of violent
crimes committed. Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same
policies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of admissions
for violent offenders remains constant over time.

punitive policies. However, there is no reason to increase the current level of punishment for people
committing violent crimes; I argue, rather, that the only way to sustain a lack of growth or negative
growth in the prison population is to implement policies that continue to lower the rate of violent
crimes committed. Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same
policies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of
admissions for violent offenders remains constant over time.

The three policies that showed potential to lower the prison population by making changes
on entry side to people committing non-violent offenses are the same policies that have potential
to bring about zero and negative growth in state prison populations. Remember that each of the
policies requires no increase in violent admissions from year to year. The first requires zero growth
in admissions for both violent and nonviolent offenses. The second requires either that the level of
admissions declines gradually over time, or that there is negative growth in the nonviolent offender
population. The third requires an immediate 25% decrease in the level of nonviolent admissions,
followed by zero growth in year-to-year admissions. Nonviolent admissions would remain at that
level for the foreseeable future. Thus there could be zero and negative growth in the prison population.
These findings demonstrate the need to integrate population dynamics when considering new
prison policies. Policymakers therefore need an accessible tool that allows them to evaluate the short-
and long-term consequences of policies.2 This tool would enable them to gauge how long it takes to
reach zero growth and the financial cost of getting there. In other words, another issue to tackle is the
length of time it will take for past policies either to die out or be offset by new policies.
In 2012, approximately 1.5 million people were incarcerated in state correctional facilities. Based on
the models, I provide the number of years until zero or negative growth can be achieved in this
population, and estimate the additional cost of supporting the prison population in the year it reaches
zero or negative growth. Table 1 displays the results of this exercise, assuming it costs around $30,000
a year to house an inmate. Without any changes in the current sentencing regime and admissions
schedule at the 30-year mark, the cost would be up to $73.8 billion, or about $30 billion more than
current costs of running prisons. Although the sentencing change does not achieve zero growth,
costs for this scenario at the 30-year mark would be far less than if nothing were done. With zero
admissions growth, the additional cost is far less, but still costly at $4.7 billion. The next situation,
a decrease in the admission of nonviolent offenders, actually takes a relatively short time, although it,
of course, depends on the rate of decline. In 2.5 years, the population reaches zero growth and the
additional costs, given the ultimate population size, decreases to approximately $960 million.

Source: Author's calculations based on data from Bureau of Justice Statistics. a Each estimate assumes that violent
admissions are constant from year to year. The additional costs assume that each inmate costs $30,000 per year.
b "Additional costs" only looks at the additional costs in the final population for each year. For the two final options,
where zero growth will not occur, the costs at 30 years was used. c "Total costs" calculates the cumulative costs
(adds costs each year) from now to the time it takes to reach zero growth. For the two final options, where zero
growth will not occur, the costs at 30 years was used.
Thus far I have only discussed the change in yearly costs at zero growth. This is important, but it
is also important to consider what it would cost to get to zero growth. Implementing policies will
slow growth, but growth will continue nonetheless, and the total cost to get to zero growth differs
substantially, depending on the intervention. Estimating the total cost depends on the number of
person-years lived in state correctional facilities. In other words, it takes into account the yearly cost
(at $30,000 per person) as the population grows. For the two options that will never result in zero
growth--decreasing sentence lengths and making no changes--the total costs at the 30-year mark are
$1.5 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively. The total cost if there is no growth in nonviolent admissions
is $1.42 trillion, and the negative growth in nonviolent admissions that will take 2.5 years comes in at
$75.6 billion. No matter what approach a state chooses, the era of mass incarceration will continue,
and will continue, and will be costly, for some time to come.
The last situation, an immediate decrease in nonviolent admissions and no growth in both violent
and nonviolent admissions for the foreseeable future, would result in immediate negative growth.
Could this happen? Remember, policies that decrease imprisonment for non-violent crimes are typically
accompanied policies that call for an increase in the punishment for violent crimes. Furthermore,
for negative growth to occur, there must be decrease over time in violent admissions. It will probably
take a number of states much more time to reach negative growth because, while achieving zero or
negative growth would be great, it would not be at all good to compromise public safety to do so.
In 2015, fewer than half of violent crimes reported were cleared by arrest or exceptional means
(Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016), which conveys that at least 50% of violent crimes committed
and reported that year had no resolution. It also means that, if all people who commit violent crimes
were caught and punished, admissions for these crimes would rise considerably. We also know
that many crimes go unreported. Thus, if we were able to increase reporting and clear a higher
percentage of violent crimes, we would certainly expect to see growth in admissions for both violent
and nonviolent crimes. These are two positive goals that should not be compromised by efforts to
achieve negative growth.
4. Discussion
The U.S. currently leads the world's nations in the absolute number of people incarcerated
(International Centre for Prison Studies 2017). The decades of depending on incarceration as the
main form of punishment have forced congressional action and led to greater transparency about the
mistakes and transgressions that put the country in such a precarious position. Although conversations
Soc. Sci. 2017, 6, 60 12 of 13
on this issue were certainly going on long before the 2008 economic crisis, the current national dialogue
on ending mass incarceration is unprecedented. Accordingly, politicians are now being pushed to
address how they will reduce the percentage of their budget spent on the criminal justice system.
However, awareness alone cannot solve the U.S. punishment problem. The U.S. justice system is
intricate and composed of different units. In addition to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which manages
the federal prison system, each state makes its own prison policies and faces different obstacles.
California, for example, enacted legislation in 2011 that dictated that the prison population must
be less than 137.5% of the intended capacity (Golaszewski 2011). California has shown a decline in
incarceration for several years now. Most credit this to the 2011 realignment legislation, which diverts
a large class of lower-level nonviolent offenders and parole violators to county jails, rather than state
correctional facilities. While this helps lower the prison population, it potentially shifts additional
burdens to the jail systems in terms of financial costs and overcrowding in jails (Kubrin and Seron 2016;
Verma 2016).
Most state prison populations continue to grow, despite efforts to lower the size and costs of
mass imprisonment. Several states have opted for less punitive measures for nonviolent offenders,
sometimes replacing prison with options such as community-based programs, fines, tickets, probation,
or even much shorter sentences. Still we must ask, can such strategies meet and maintain the policies'
intended goals?
For centuries, demographers explored ways to encourage and discourage fertility rates that
achieve the golden standard we call a stationary population. This is what China sought to do to avoid
population explosion, and this is one of the central ideas explored in this paper as a means to reduce
the size of the U.S. prison population. While China did meet its intended goal, it was left with many
unintended consequences. As such, careful and dynamic action must be taken to understand the
current prison situation, including the expected costs of prisons and how those costs can be alleviated
without sacrificing public safety. For example, we must also consider how to reduce the cascading
consequences that currently seem to ensure that people who are "marked" (Pager 2003) with a criminal
record will eventually return to prison.
The findings of this paper demonstrated that policies related solely to the sentencing regime
will do little, if anything, to lower the prison population. Policies that reduced admissions via
decriminalization of crimes or rerouting people to alternatives that did not leave the mark of a criminal
record showed the most promise. Additionally, removing legislation that inhibits former inmates'
ability to integrate into society could be helpful. However, all of this must be considered alongside
the United States' low clearance rate for crime in general and the current size of the violent offender
population. If long-term reduction in the size of the prison population is the goal, the U.S. must attend
to strategies to prevent violent crimes and consider reforming the current punishments associated
with their commission.
