Purpose: Black and White middle-aged adults
typically are in a pivot position of providing support
to generations above and below. Racial differences
in support to each generation in the family remain
unclear, however. Different factors may account for
racial differences in support of grown children versus
aging parents. Design and Methods: Middle-
aged adults (aged 40­60 years; 35%, n = 216 Black
and 65%, n = 397 White) rated social support they
provided each aging parent and grown child. Partici-
pants reported background characteristics represent-
ing their resources and measures of needs for each
family member. Interviews also assessed beliefs about
obligation to support parents and grown children and
rewards from helping. Results: Multilevel models
revealed White middle-aged adults provided more
support to grown children than Black middle-aged
adults. Demands from offspring, beliefs about sup-
port, and rewards from helping explained these
racial differences. Black middle-aged adults provided
more support to parents than White middle-aged
adults. Beliefs about support and feelings of
personal reward from providing support explained
this difference but resources and demands did
not. Implications: Racial differences varied by
generation (parent or offspring). The prolonged tran-
sitions common for White young adults explained
racial differences in support of offspring. Middle-
aged adults may treat support of parents as more dis-
cretionary, with cultural ideas about obligation and
personal rewards guiding behaviors.

In Western countries, middle-aged adults typi-
cally are often in a pivot position of providing sup-
port to generations above and below (Attias-Donfut
& Wolff, 2000; Fingerman et al., 2010; Grundy &
Henretta, 2006). Prior research addresses racial dif-
ferences in the support middle-aged adults and
aging parents exchange in Black and White families
(e.g., Laditka & Laditka, 2001; Silverstein & Waite,
1993; Suitor, Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007) but has
rarely considered grown children in these support
exchanges (e.g., White-Means & Rubin, 2008).
Here, we examined racial differences in support
middle-aged adults provide younger and older
generations (i.e., to each grown child and to each
aging parent). We extend the literature regarding
racial disparities in family support (Chatters,
Taylor, Lincoln, & Schroepfer, 2002; Stack, 1974),
by considering factors that evoke support to
family members in each generation.
Conceptual Framework: Resources and Demands,
Beliefs and Rewards
Elsewhere, we have proposed a theoretical
model integrating structural factors and
intrapsychic factors to explain family support

(Fingerman & Birditt, in press). This model builds
on contingency theory, which predicts that indi-
viduals will respond to family members' urgent
needs (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Schoeni, 1997).
We have extended the theory to consider a vari-
ety of perceived needs: (1) emerging crises, (2)
ongoing problems, (3) everyday needs, and (4)
support for future success. Our prior research
suggests that middle-aged adults respond to this
full range of needs but provide different types of
support (i.e., financial vs. advice) in reaction to
different needs (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, &
Zarit, 2009). Each generation may experience
different types of needs, and these distinctions, in
turn, may translate into different patterns of
racial differences in support to grown children as
opposed to aging parents.
Our model also included a distinct facet of con-
tingency theory, namely constraints on resources.
The amount of support an individual provides
family members is limited by resources (e.g.,
income, time) and combined demands for those
resources (family members' needs; Grundy &
Henretta, 2006). By considering multiple family
members, we examine how individuals of different
races make decisions about trade-offs in helping
each family member.
Finally, intrapsychic factors such as cultural
ideas about obligations and feelings about family
also motivate provision of support (Silverstein,
Gans, & Yang, 2006). Elsewhere, researchers have
debated whether structural factors versus cultural
factors explain racial differences in family support
(Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004). But cultural factors
(e.g., beliefs about obligation, appraisals of rewards
or stress) may lead to different reactions to struc-
tural limits (i.e., whether people choose to expand
resources or reduce support; Fingerman & Birditt,
in press). Here, we apply this model to examine
racial differences in support to each generation.
Support to Grown Children
In American families, the flow of intergenera-
tional support is typically downstream; parents
provide more support to their grown children than
the reverse (Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson, 2005;
Shapiro, 2004). Yet, the majority of studies of sup-
port to grown children have relied on White sam-
ples. As such, we do not have a full portrait of
the range of support that Black families provide
grown children or how that compares with White
families.
The limited research on racial differences in
support of grown children has focused mainly on
economic exchanges and has found that parents in
Black families provide less help to children than in
White families (Berry, 2006; Lee & Aytac, 1998).
Resources may partially explain these findings:
Black adults typically have less wealth and poorer
health than White adults (Swartz, 2009), which
accounts for lower parental financial transfers
(Berry, 2006).
The nature of demands from grown children
may also differ for Black and White middle-aged
parents. Black young adults are more likely to suf-
fer crises (e.g., crime, unemployment; Furstenberg,
2010), but these crises may be transient and
not affect all offspring in the family (Birditt,
Fingerman, & Zarit, 2010). By contrast, well-off
young adults experience prolonged transitions to
adulthood, marked by statuses (e.g., student) that
necessitate persistent support (Arnett, 2000). In
comparison to Black young adults, if White young
adults undergo prolonged transitions and occupy
such statuses, they may receive greater financial
and practical support.
Cultural beliefs also may contribute to racial
disparities in support of grown children. The
nature and implications of these beliefs for
support of grown children are not clear, however.
Researchers have documented that Black Americans
endorse strong filial obligation to support aging
parents (Becker, Beyene, Newsom, & Mayen,
2003; Burr & Mutchler, 1999; Dilworth-Anderson
et al., 2005), but researchers have not assessed
beliefs about obligation to support grown chil-
dren. White adults may experience a stronger sense
of obligation to assist grown offspring due to their
prolonged transitions to adulthood (Furstenberg,
2010).
Furthermore, rewards from providing support
may favor material and practical support of grown
children in White families. Research suggests peo-
ple sometimes help because it makes them feel good
(Dovidio, Piliavin, Schroeder, & Penner, 2006).
Parents, in particular, may derive a sense of reward
from supporting grown children to reach personal
goals (Fingerman et al., 2009; Ryff, Lee, Essex, &
Schmutte, 1994). If White young adults have
greater opportunity to seek fulfillment of personal
goals, White parents may experience a greater
sense of reward in supporting them to do so.
Intrapsychic factors also may play a role in the
types of support individuals of different races
offer family members (Becker et al., 2003). Studies
Vol. 51, No. 4, 2011 443
examining practical and financial support by race
have tended to aggregate kin support across family
members, and findings are inconsistent (Sarkisian &
Gerstel, 2004; Suitor et al, 2007; White-Means &
Rubin, 2008). In this study, we speculated that due
to their greater resources, White parents may offer
more money and time to their grown children
(Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004), whereas Black par-
ents may offer nontangible support reflecting both
their resources and cultural beliefs. Due to wide-
spread racism, Black parents may seek to provide
their children with advice to overcome discrimina-
tion. Researchers have noted strong norms of fam-
ily solidarity in Black families (Hill, 1999; Suitor
et al., 2007), which may foster exchanges of emo-
tional support. Thus, Black parents may provide
less overall support to grown children than White
parents but may provide certain types of support
(advice and emotional support) more often.
Support to Elderly Parents
Although contradictory evidence exists, Black
Americans seem to provide more support to aging
parents than White Americans do (Dilworth-
Anderson et al., 2005; Taylor, 2000). As with sup-
port to grown children, resources and demands
might help explain this disparity. Black middle-
aged adults may have fewer resources than White
middle-aged adults, yet their parents may have
greater needs than White parents. These needs may
be different than those of offspring, as Black par-
ents are more likely to suffer disability due to fac-
tors such as lower socioeconomic status (SES) and
discrimination in health care (Kelley-Moore &
Ferraro, 2004).
Cultural beliefs also play a role in support of
parents. Compared with White Americans, Black
Americans endorse more positive beliefs regarding
assistance to aging parents (Burr & Mutchler,
1999). Black women experience less burden when
caring for disabled parents compared with White
women (Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2005). Black
adults also derive self-fulfillment and find it more
rewarding to help their parents than White adults
do (White, Townsend, & Stephens, 2000).
Although Black Americans typically have stron-
ger norms regarding family than White Americans
(Burr & Mutchler, 1999), these norms may differ
by generation. Benjamin (2000) documented
cohort differences in Black American's beliefs
about family and neighborhood cohesion, show-
ing older generations may feel stronger norms of
reciprocity toward one another than the youngest
generation alive today. Thus, we expected Black
middle-aged adults to report greater support of
aging parents in response to such feelings of inter-
generational cohesion, sense of obligation, and
reward from helping parents.
Other Factors Associated With Support
We included covariates that might explain racial
differences in support. For example, Laditka and
Laditka (2001) documented the role of gender (as
well as race) in support; Black women gave more
support to aging parents than White women or
men of either race. Family structures may play a
role in support, with parents providing less to each
child in larger families (Davey, Janke, & Savla,
2005). Black parents tend to have a greater num-
ber of children than White parents (Dye, 2008).
Likewise, marital status may play a role in paren-
tal support. Black women are likely to be single,
and the matrilineal family structure may evoke fil-
ial support (Taylor, 2000). Conversely, step family
ties involve fewer support exchanges (Coleman,
Ganong, & Rothrauff, 2006) and Black adults are
less likely to have step family ties.
Methods
Sample
The sample included Black (n = 216; 108 men
and 108 women) and White (n = 397; 184 men
and 213 women) adults ages 40­60. Criteria for
the study included having at least one child aged
older than 18 years and at least one living parent.
National data suggest 49.6% of White adults and
46.3% of Black adults aged 40­60 years have a
living parent and a grown child (Sweet & Bumpass,
1996).
Participants resided in the Philadelphia Primary
Metropolitan Statistical Area (including urban,
suburban, and rural areas; Pennsylvania State
Data Center, 2001). Recruitment occurred via
telephone lists purchased from Genesys Corpora-
tion and random digit dialing in regional area
codes. Genesys Corporation derived lists from the
white pages, automobile registration, driver's
licenses, voter registrations, birth records, con-
sumer surveys, coupon redemption information,
direct mail, books and merchandize, and other
proprietary data sources. Participants who had
a listed address received a prenotification letter
informing them of the study, followed by a
The Gerontologist

phone call. Participants who did not have a listed
address were recruited directly by telephone.
Screening interviews identified eligible partici-
pants. Of 845 potential eligible participants who
completed the screening, 634 (75%) were inter-
viewed. Of these participants, 20 individuals
identified as Asian American, Native American,
or multiracial (not including African American)
and were not included in the current study. One
participant celebrated his 61st birthday between
the screening and the interview, and his data were
excluded.
By oversampling in high-density ethnic minority
neighborhoods, we recruited a high proportion of
African American participants. Data were col-
lected from January through August 2008. In com-
parisontothegeneralpopulationinthePhiladelphia
area, participants of both races were better edu-
cated and somewhat more likely to be married or
employed. Black and White subsamples had com-
parable income and rates of disability to the gen-
eral population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008; see
Table 1).
We examined racial differences in background
variables. Compared with White participants,
Black participants had fewer years of education
t = 3.09, p < .05, lower income t = 5.22, p < .001,
rated their health more poorly t = 5.00, p < .001,
had more children t = -3.56, p < .01, were less
likely to be married c2 = 96.66, p < .001, and had
a greater likelihood of having a disability c2 =
21.35, p < .001. Black offspring were older t =
-8.47, p < .001, had fewer years of education
t = 5.52, p < .001, were rated in poorer health
t = 8.33, p < .001, more likely to be a stepchild of
participant c2 = 6.07, p < .05, and less likely to
reside with the participant c2 = 10.40, p < .01 than
with White offspring. Black parents were younger
t = 3.44, p < .001, had fewer years of education
t = 4.17, p < .001, more children t = -4.34, p < .001,
were less likely to be married c2 = 123.34,
p < .001, and more likely to reside with the par-
ticipant c2 = 20.53, p < .001.
Procedures
Computer Assisted Telephone Interview soft-
ware allowed random order of administration of
sections of the survey pertaining to parents and
offspring. Participants reported on each child older
than age 18 years (n = 669 for Black participants
and n = 1,056 for White participants) and each
parent (n = 432 for Black participants and n = 794
for White participants).

Measures
Background Variables and Resources.--
Participant characteristics and resources. Partici-
pants reported their age, gender, and marital status
(0 = not married, 1 = married). We assessed
resources as health and SES. Subjective health was
rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excel-
lent). We included two indicators of SES: educa-
tion (i.e., years of education) and household income
in2007,1(lessthan$10,000),2($10,001­$25,000),
3 ($25,001­$40,000), 4 ($40,001­75,000), 5
($75,001­$100,000), and 6 (more than $100,000)
(McGarry & Schoeni, 1997).
Parent and offspring characteristics. Partici-
pants reported age, gender, and background in-
formation for each grown child (664 daughters
and 720 sons) and living parent (543 mothers
and 325 fathers; see Table 1). They also indicat-
ed marital status, whether the parent or grown
child resided with them and how they were re-
lated (i.e., biological/adopted or step family
tie).
Support Exchanges.--We used the multidi-
mensional Intergenerational Support Scale (ISS;
Fingerman et al, 2009) to assess tangible and
nontangible support to each parent and each
grown child. The scale assesses frequency of
emotional, practical, companionship, advice,
financial support, and lending an attentive ear to
the other, using a scale from 1 (less than once a
year or not at all) to 8 (daily). Consistent with
prior studies, we computed the mean of the six
items for each child and each parent. Coefficient
alphas were high (a = .87 White parents to
a = .90 Black offspring). Table 2 presents descriptive
information for each type of support to parents
and offspring.
Explanatory Variables: Needs.--We included
measures that serve as proxy variables for parental
and offspring needs, which by extension represent
demands for support within the family.
Problems. As one measure of need, participants
completed the Life Problems Scale (Fingerman
et al., 2009). Participants reported whether each
child or parent had experienced the following
problems in the past two years: severe health prob-
lem or injury, emotional or psychological problem,
victim of a crime, alcohol or drug problem, finan-
cial issues or unemployment, problems with the
law, divorce or serious relationship problem, and
widowed. We created a sum score of problems for
each family member.
Student status. Student status is associated
with increased parental support (Lee & Aytac,
1998). We measured this variable dichotomously
(1 = student, 0 = not student).
Disability. Participants completed five items
from the Community Disability Scale for each par-
ent (Bassett & Folstein, 1991). Participants indi-
cated 35% of Black and 30% of White parents
had at least one functional disability. Disability
among children was minimal and thus not included
in analyses.

Explanatory Variables: Beliefs and Rewards.--
We included measures that assess intrapsychic fac-
tors, such as participants' beliefs about support
and appraisals of rewards from providing support.
Cultural beliefs about obligation to family. Par-
ticipants completed a measure of filial obligation
to support parents, adapted from prior research
(Silverstein et al., 2006). Participants indicated
how often adults should provide each of the six
types of support in the ISS to their parents (e.g.,
financial, emotional, practical) from 1 (never) to 5
(always), a = .79 for Black participants and a = .80
for White participants.
Participants also completed a parallel measure
regarding obligation to support grown children
developed for this study, a =.72 for Black partici-
pants and a =.74 for White participants.
Rewards from providing support. Participants
indicated how rewarding they find it to help each
child and each parent, rated 1 (not at all) to 5
(a great deal).
Analytic Strategy.--We tested models of racial
differences in support to each generation. We
hypothesized that the pattern of racial differences
would vary for each generation, and different
needs would evoke support for aging parents and
grown children. Thus, we estimated models sepa-
rately for support of parents and offspring. The
dependent variable was frequency of support to
each parent or grown child.
Because participants reported on multiple chil-
dren and one or two parents, we used the PROC
Mixed procedure in SAS (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &
Wolfinger, 1996) to estimate multilevel models,
accounting for the nested data (i.e., parents and
children nested within participants). The indepen-
dent variable was race (1 = Black, 0 = White). First,
we estimated models including race as a predictor
with covariates. We then included variables assess-
ing resources and demands, followed by a model
including cultural beliefs and personal rewards
from helping to ascertain whether these variables
accounted for racial differences. To compare mod-
els, we estimated a model fit statistic by calculating
the difference between the -2 log likelihood coef-
ficients from each model. We examined this differ-
ence on a chi-square distribution, with the change
in the number of parameters as the degrees of free-
dom (Singer & Willett, 2003). Post hoc tests
addressed support of both generations. We also
considered different groupings of variables to
assure stability of findings.
Results
Racial Differences in Support to Offspring
First, we tested racial differences in support of
offspring and explanations for such differences. In
these multilevel models, support provided to the
average grown child was the outcome and race
was the predictor variable. We included partici-
pant and offspring gender and marital status, step
relationship versus biological relationship, and
offspring coresidence with participant as control
variables. As can be seen in Table 3, with race as
the sole predictor, Black participants reported that
they gave less to the average grown child than
White participants did.
The next model examined resources and
demands on support. Resources included middle-
aged participants' income, education, and health.
Demands included offspring's student status, age
(younger age as a proxy for needs), and offspring
problems or crises. When these variables were
included, the effect of race was reduced and became
nonsignificant (see Table 3). Offspring who were
students, who suffered a greater number of prob-
lems, or who were younger received more support.
As can be seen in Table 3, the model including
demands and resources was a better fit than that
with only race as a predictor.
Next, we examined cultural beliefs about obli-
gation and rewards from helping, also including
resources and demands and covariates in the
model. Participants' obligation to help and rewards
from helping were associated with more support.
Again, we compared -2 log likelihood coefficients,
and this model was a better fit.
Note that across models, some covariates were
significantly associated with support. Mothers
reported giving more to grown children than did
fathers. Daughters and children who coresided
with parents received more support; married chil-
dren and stepchildren received less support.
We also asked whether racial differences in sup-
port were limited to specific types of support using
separate multilevel models with each of type of
support (e.g., emotional, advice) as the outcomes
and p < .01 significance level to account for multi-
ple comparisons. These models each showed a
consistent significant racial difference with White
parents giving more support in the initial model,
Vol. 51, No. 4, 2011 447
except for advice. The analysis for advice showed
no significant racial difference in the absence of
control variables, resources and demands, or
beliefs and personal rewards. Racial differences
for all other types of support became nonsignifi-
cant when we entered resources and demands in
the models.
Racial Differences in Support to Aging Parents
The analytic strategy regarding racial differ-
ences in support to aging parents was similar to
that for support to grown children. For control
variables, we included participant's and parents'
gender, participant's and parents' marital status,
step relationship to parent, and whether the parent
coresides with the participant. Because number of
living parents (one or two) correlated highly with
parental marital status (r = .66), we did not include
number of living parents as a covariate.
As can be seen in Table 4, with race as the sole
predictor, Black participants reported that they
gave more to the average parent than White par-
ticipants did. We then estimated a model including
resources and demands. For parents, we defined
demands as parental disability, problems in the
past year, and age (with older age as a proxy for
needs). As can be seen in Table 4, the effect for
race remained significant, although a greater num-
ber of parental problems and older parental age
also were significantly associated with more sup-
port. The model with demands and resources was
a better fit than that with race as the sole predictor.
Finally, we included filial obligation to help par-
ents and rewards from helping the parent. As can
be seen in Table 4, the effect for race was no longer
significant with these variables. Participants'
greater obligation to assist parents and finding it
rewarding to help the parent were associated with
more support.
Again, covariates were associated with support.
Middle-aged women of both races provided more
support to parents. Mothers as well as parents
who coresided with the participant received more
support. Married parents received less support
than parents who were not married (i.e., widowed,
divorced, or single parents).

Next, we asked whether racial differences are
limited to specific types of support. We conducted
separate multilevel models for each of the type of
support (e.g., emotional, advice), adjusting signifi-
cance level to p < .01 to account for multiple com-
parisons. There was no significant racial difference
in frequency with which middle-aged adults listen
to their parents talk about daily events, but all
other types of support showed a significant differ-
ence, with Black adults giving more frequent sup-
port to their parents.
Post Hoc Tests
We conducted analyses to assess stability in
findings and to answer remaining questions. First,
we considered whether greater support of one gen-
eration undermines support available for the other
generation. Specifically, we asked whether (1)
racial disparities in support to offspring stemmed
from greater support Black participants provide
their parents and (2) racial disparities in support of
parents stemmed from greater support White par-
ticipants provide offspring.
We estimated a multilevel model with support
to the average offspring as the outcome, including
total support to parents (i.e., sum of support to
each parent) as a family level variable and control
variables. The model was identical to that pre-
sented in Table 3 (model with control variables),
with total support to parents also included as a
variable. Racial differences remained, with White
participants still reporting more support to
the average grown child, B = -0.44, t = -3.84,
p < .001.
We also estimated a multilevel model with sup-
port to the average parent as the outcome and
including total support to offspring (i.e., sum of
support to all offspring) and control variables.
This model was the same as that presented in Table
4, with the addition of total support to offspring in
the model. Again, racial differences in support of
parents remained, with Black parents reporting
greater support to the average parent, B = 0.55,
t =4.64, p < .001.
Finally, some control variables could be consid-
ered demands rather than covariates (i.e., number
of children in family, coresiding with participant).
We examined those variables in equations with
resources and demands, excluding other control
variables, and the pattern of findings was the same.

Discussion
This study extends research regarding intergen-
erational family support in several respects: (1) by
comparing racial differences in middle-aged adults'
support to parents and to grown children in the
same family, (2) by examining racial differences in
support to multiple parents and offspring, and (3)
by comparing explanatory factors (i.e., resources
and demands and cultural beliefs) in observed
racial differences for each generation. The findings
suggest racial patterns in support differ by genera-
tion (i.e., whether the support is given to parents
or children), which has implications for how inter-
ventions for providing support to families assisting
elders are designed.
The results supported our model that family
support is accounted for by resources and demands
(family members' needs) and intrapsychic factors
(cultural beliefs about support and rewards of pro-
viding everyday support; Fingerman & Birditt, in
press). These findings are consistent with literature
showing racial disparities are generated by multi-
ple factors and pathways (e.g., Schulz et al., 2000).
These principles operated in this study to explain
racial differences in support, but the factors that
evoke support differed for each generation. Indeed,
findings supporting different sides of the debate
regarding explanations for racial differences in
family support (e.g., Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004)
may partially stem from a focus in the literature on
only two generations in any study. When we con-
sidered support to parents and offspring in the
same family, however, explanations for racial dif-
ferences varied depending on the generation receiv-
ing support.
Racial differences involving middle-aged adults'
greater support to grown offspring were explained
by differences in everyday demands that offspring
face. The prolonged transition to adulthood (rep-
resented by student status, younger age, and lack
of marital partner) was associated with greater
support to offspring. These findings suggest soci-
etal structures that offer greater opportunity to
White young adults may explain the observed
racial differences in support. Under similar oppor-
tunity structures, that is, when we controlled for
statuses such as being a student, Black, and White
parents offered comparable support to offspring.
By contrast, health crises were more evident for
parents but did not explain the racial difference of
greater support that Black middle-aged adults pro-
vided their parents. Black middle-aged adults'
greater support of parents remained evident even
when we accounted for resources and demands.
Only when we included obligation and rewards of
helping did the racial differences disappear. These
findings are consistent with a well-documented
Black American history of support of elderly par-
ents (Burr & Mutchler, 1999; Dilworth-Anderson
et al., 2005). Middle-aged Blacks, on average, gave
more support to parents and that difference was
explained by their stronger endorsement of cul-
tural beliefs about support of parents, as well as
personal rewards in providing support.
The findings also provide insights into the pri-
macy of different aspects of our model of support.
Our initial model presumed that resources and
demands place structural parameters on support.
But findings in this study suggest intrapsychic fac-
tors (beliefs and rewards) may be of equal or
greater importance in support of older genera-
tions. Our findings suggest middle-aged adults of
both races provide for their children if they have
the resources to do so and perceive their children
to be in need. By contrast, support of parents may
be viewed as more discretionary by White middle-
aged adults and thus varied more as a function of
beliefs and feelings.
It is possible that unmeasured support to other
family members played a role in exchange patterns
as well. This study incorporated a greater number
of family members than prior studies by assessing
support to each living parent and to each grown
child, but we did not include support to siblings or
to in-laws. White middle-aged adults were more
likely to be married than Black middle-aged adults.
Thus, support to in-laws may help explain the
lower support White middle-aged adults provided
their own parents.
Likewise, it is notable that when we examined
each type of support separately, we found no racial
difference with regard to parental advice to grown
children. The nature of that advice might differ,
however, and warrants follow-up. For example,
we did not assess support to deal with discrimina-
tion or support to foster racial pride, but Black
parents offer such support to their children grow-
ing up (Ceballo & McLoyd, 2002; Garcia Coll et
al., 1996) and may continue to do so for their
young adult offspring.
Implications for Practice
These findings on intergenerational exchanges
suggest challenges and opportunities for intervention
The Gerontologist

when families are confronted with extensive
demands in caring for an aging adult or in other
family crises. For Black families, interventions
could build on the strong feelings of filial obliga-
tion, though in doing so, it will be important to
monitor if individuals might be taking on more
responsibilities than they can manage. Finally,
other studies suggest that Black families might
draw on other support partners in the church or
broader community (Uehara, 1994; Walls & Zarit,
1991).
The findings regarding Black families also have
policy implications. In Black families, middle-aged
adults derive rewards from helping their parents
(White et al., 2000), and policies that support the
middle-aged adult's ability to support their own
parents are likely to be most useful. In principle,
U.S. public policy supports home care, but services
and financial supports are inconsistently available
and not well coordinated with medical care.
Expansion of programs such as paid leave or finan-
cial incentives to give family care may be of greater
benefit to Black families, facilitating their willing-
ness to serve as full-time or part-time caregivers.
Yet, efforts must be made to assure that Black
caregivers to do not suffer burn out or over burden
from these tasks. A meta-analysis of studies of
caregivers revealed that Black caregivers suffered
less depression than caregivers of other races or
ethnicity, but poorer health (Pinquart & Sorensen,
2005). Thus, policy and practice should support
rewarding aspects of caregiving in Black families
while attending to the physical costs such care may
entail.
For White families, resources that could be used
for care of parents may be limited if the middle-
aged parent is also providing assistance to grown
children (Fingerman et al., 2010; Grundy &
Henretta, 2006). Of course, grown children could
potentially be a resource in caregiving, but findings
in the current study suggest demands of a pro-
longed transition to adulthood may direct limited
resources away from grandparents. It is also
important for gerontologists to recognize that
needs of the younger generation are not secondary
to those of the aged parents, but rather take a dif-
ferent form (i.e., everyday needs vs. emerging
physical crises). Clinicians who work with such
families may need to help these middle-aged adults
balance their limited resources rather than feeling
pressured to expand those resources to cover all
family members' needs (Grundy & Henretta,
2006).
Limitations and Future Directions
The study also has several limitations. Partici-
pants were all from one region, the Philadelphia
Metropolitan Area. The National Survey of Black
Americans revealed regional and urban/rural dif-
ferences, with Black families in the South showing
different patterns than urban Black families in the
North (Taylor, 2000). As such, findings may be
limited in generalizability to northern urban areas.
In addition, the study relied on cross-sectional
data. It is not clear whether racial disparities in
provision of support to parents may alter as par-
ents' health continues to decline. Indeed, racial dis-
parities may be even greater when parents require
intensive hands on care due to White middle-aged
adults' greater willingness to place a parent in a
nursing home (Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2005).
The study also failed to include forms of sup-
port that may be evident in Black families but not
in White families. For example, we did not mea-
sure spiritual support or ways in which middle-
aged adults may help support parent's or offspring's
religious involvement. Religion plays a large role
in Black family life (Dilworth-Anderson, Boswell,
& Cohen, 2007; Hill, 1999).
Moreover, we also note that the influence of
social structural factors (e.g., material resources) is
not truly distinct from cultural beliefs (e.g., sense
of obligation; see Sarkisian & Gerstel, 2004). For
example, Black adults endorse intergenerational
coresidence more than White adults do (Berry,
2006; Burr & Mutchler, 1999), but Black adults
also face housing discrimination and difficulties
obtaining mortgages that may contribute to these
beliefs.
Furthermore, families in any given racial group
are heterogeneous (Taylor, 2000). Consideration
of racial differences here provided insight into how
structures (resources and demands) and intrapsy-
chic factors (cultural beliefs and feelings of reward)
may contribute to exchanges, but these structures
and intrapsychic factors also vary within races.
In sum, Black and White middle-aged adults pro-
vided support to generations above and below. Fam-
ily support appears to vary by race, but this study
suggests racial differences differ depending on the
generation receiving support (grown child or par-
ent). White middle-aged adults provided greater sup-
port to their grown offspring, but Black middle-aged
adults provided greater support to parents. Demands
from offspring explained racial disparities in support
of grown offspring. By contrast, racial differences in
Vol. 51, No. 4, 2011 451
support to parents were not explained by resources
and demands but rather by beliefs and rewards from
helping. As such, gerontologists should consider
generation, resources and demands, and intrapsy-
chic factors such as beliefs and feelings about sup-
port to understand racial differences in support.
