on Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Adolescents
Kenn B. Daratha, PhD; Ruth C. Bindler, RNC, PhD
Objectives: To examine selected clinical characteris-
tics for cohorts of similar adolescents over 4 survey pe-
riods from 1999-2006, to examine changes in rates of ado-
lescents who exceed cutoff points for individual
components of metabolic syndrome (MetS), to describe
sex differences in individual components of MetS, to de-
scribe changes in MetS prevalence from 1999-2006 using
4 common MetS definitions, and to describe sex differ-
ences in MetS prevalence from 1999-2006.
Design: Cross-sectional, US representational National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999-
2006.
Setting: Mobile examination centers conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Participants: For 1999-2000, 613 adolescents (aged
12-19 years); for 2001-2002, 892 adolescents; for 2003-
2004, 857 adolescents; and for 2005-2006, 814 adoles-
cents. Exclusions were pregnancy, taking insulin or dia-
betic pills, and incomplete measurements.
Main Outcome Measures: Fasting plasma glucose level,
triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood
pressures.
Results: Increases in fasting plasma glucose and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreases in dia-
stolic blood pressure were observed. Rates of adoles-
cents exceeding cutoff points for fasting plasma glucose
levels have increased. Compared with girls, adolescent
boys had higher rates exceeding cutoff points for fasting
plasma glucose and high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol levels. Adolescent girls had higher rates exceeding
cutoff points for waist circumference. The prevalence of
MetS among adolescents has not changed. No sex dif-
ferences in MetS prevalence were observed.
Conclusions: Some criteria for MetS have remained stable
(triglyceride level and systolic blood pressure) and one
has improved for boys (high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol level), but waist circumference has increased in girls
and the rate of an elevated fasting plasma glucose level
has nearly doubled for both boys and girls. Adolescent
MetS prevalence has remained stable from 1999-2006.

to 60% had MetS depending on the definition used.16 In
another study of 1205 children aged 4 to 16 years with obe-
sity, MetS was found in 6% to 39% depending on the defi-
nition of the syndrome.17 An increase in the syndrome was
describedfrom1988-2000.18 Ina10-yearlongitudinalstudy,
3.5% of black girls and 2.3% of white girls developed MetS,
and central adiposity was most strongly associated with
emergence of the syndrome.19 Two studies examined col-
lective MetS criteria, identifying an increase in MetS among
US adolescents from 4.2% to 6.4% between 1988 and
2000.7,8 The application of the various criteria for MetS in
adolescence leads to different prevalence rates.14,20,21 The
Pediatric Metabolic Syndrome Working Group is study-
ing traditional pediatric MetS criteria as well as the useful-
ness of adding criteria such as levels of adiponectin and in-
flammatory biomarkers.22
Questions remain about variation of individual com-
ponents of MetS in adolescents over time, what changes
have occurred in the prevalence of MetS, and what cut-
off points should be applied.23,24 However, the rapid in-
crease in adolescents' overweight over the last 3 de-
cades, the emergence of type 2 diabetes in this age group,
and data that show longitudinal tracking of cardiovas-
cular risk factors from childhood to adulthood suggest
that translation of MetS work to adolescence is needed.25,26
The purposes of our study were as follows: (1) to ex-
amine selected clinical characteristics for cohorts of simi-
lar adolescents over 4 survey periods from 1999-2006;
(2) to examine changes in rates of adolescents who ex-
ceed cutoff points for individual components of MetS;
(3) to describe sex differences in individual compo-
nents of MetS; (4) to describe changes in MetS preva-
lence from 1999-2006 using 4 common MetS defini-
tions; and (5) to describe sex differences in MetS
prevalence from 1999-2006.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Study samples were drawn from the NHANES 1999-2000, 2001-
2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006. The NHANES samples the
civilian noninstitutionalized US population using a complex
multistage design. Our sample (n=3176) was drawn from par-
ticipants in the survey who were aged 12 to 19 years, were not
taking insulin or diabetic pills, were not pregnant, completed
physical examinations, and fasted for at least 8 hours prior to
blood testing. Waist circumference, BP, and serum levels for
fasting plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), and triglycerides were recorded for all of the partici-
pants in this sample. Parents or guardians provided consent,
and research participants younger than 18 years provided as-
sent. Human subject approval was obtained by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
PROTOCOLS AND DEFINITIONS
Fasting blood samples were obtained by venipuncture at mo-
bile examination centers and transported in recommended meth-
ods to laboratories for analysis. Triglycerides and HDL-C were
processed enzymatically in a series of coupled reactions by the
Johns Hopkins University Lipid Analytic Laboratory. Levels of
HDL-C showed an average increase of 3.0 mg/dL (to convert
to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) in the last 2 survey
periods compared with the first 2 survey periods. It is most likely
that a change in methods was responsible for the increase in
HDL-C values.27 Accordingly, in this study each research par-
ticipant's HDL-C value for 2003-2006 was lowered by 3.0 mg/
dL. The fasting plasma glucose level was determined by the Col-
laborative Studies Clinical Laboratory using the Roche/
Hitachi 911 instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). (See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm for fur-
ther details about the measurement and laboratory proce-
dures.) For this study, dichotomous variables were derived for
healthy and unhealthy values for each cut point including tri-
glyceride (110 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0113]), fasting plasma glucose (110 mg/dL and 100
mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]),
and HDL-C (40 mg/dL and 35 mg/dL) levels.
Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint be-
tween the bottom of the rib cage and above the top of the iliac
crest during minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Waist
circumference greater than or equal to the 90th percentile for
age and sex provided the cutoff for the dichotomous variable
of abdominal obesity.28
Measurements of BP were completed during the physical
examination following a standardized protocol, including mea-
surement on the right arm with a cuff bladder two-thirds of the
arm circumference and 1 inch above the antecubital fossa. Up
to 4 BP measurements were collected and the mean of all but
the first reading was calculated. A systolic or diastolic BP mean
greater than or equal to the 90th percentile based on age, sex,
and stature using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute guidelines29 provided the cutoff for the dichotomous vari-
able of hypertension. Metabolic syndrome was defined as par-
ticipants having 3 or more of 5 criteria (elevated triglyceride
levels, low HDL-C levels, elevated fasting plasma glucose lev-
els, elevated abdominal obesity, and hypertension).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sampling weights based on fasting participants were used to
complete a complex sampling analysis. Estimated mean per-
centages and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as well as na-
tional estimates of the prevalence of MetS and each compo-
nent of the syndrome were calculated. Temporal and sex
differences in MetS and each component were compared using
complex sampling t tests and 2 test for proportions. Statisti-
cal significance of =.05 was established a priori.
RESULTS
Adolescent respondents over 4 survey periods showed
similar demographic characteristics and clinical charac-
teristics (Table 1). The average age of respondents over
the 4 survey periods was 15.45 years (95% CI, 15.33-
15.56 years), and 47.9% (95% CI, 45.4%-50.4%) were fe-
male. Triglyceride levels remained stable (t1399
=0.845;
P=.40) from 1999-2000 (mean, 87.09 mg/dL; 95% CI,
81.73-92.44 mg/dL) to 2005-2006 (mean, 90.59 mg/dL;
95% CI, 84.46-96.73 mg/dL). The average waist circum-
ference did not change (t1399
=0.881; P=.38) from 1999-
2000 (mean, 80.52 cm; 95% CI, 78.71-82.34 cm) to 2005-
2006 (mean, 81.58 cm; 95% CI, 80.08-83.09 cm). The
systolic BP remained stable (t1399
=0.101; P=.92) from
1999-2000 (mean, 110.18 mm Hg; 95% CI, 108.88-
111.48 mm Hg) to 2005-2006 (mean, 110.10 mm Hg;
95% CI, 109.10-111.09 mm Hg).

Some clinical characteristics changed from 1999-2000
to 2005-2006 (Table 1). Fasting plasma glucose levels in-
creased significantly (t1399
=4.827; P.001) from 1999-
2000 (mean, 90.41 mg/dL; 95% CI, 89.56-91.26 mg/dL)
to 2005-2006 (mean, 93.12 mg/dL; 95% CI, 92.42-93.81
mg/dL). The HDL-C levels averaged 48.02 mg/dL (95% CI,
46.71-49.34 mg/dL) in 1999-2000 and increased
(t1399
=2.274; P=.02) to an average of 50.06 mg/dL (95%
CI, 48.90-51.21 mg/dL) in 2005-2006. The diastolic BP de-
creased (t1399
=6.019; P.001) from 1999-2000 (mean,
65.50 mm Hg; 95% CI, 64.25-66.74 mm Hg) to 2005-
2006 (mean, 60.28 mm Hg; 95% CI, 59.12-61.43 mm Hg).
Most rates of adolescents exceeding cutoff points for in-
dividual components defining MetS did not change over
the 4 survey periods (Table 2). In 1999-2000, 8.3% (95%
CI,5.6%-12.2%)ofresearchparticipantshadBPgreaterthan
or equal to the 90th percentile. In 2005-2006, 8.8% (95%
CI,6.3%-12.1%)ofresearchparticipantshadBPgreaterthan
or equal to the 90th percentile (2=0.09; P=.84). In 1999-
2000, 23.0% (95% CI, 18.0%-28.8%) of research partici-
pantshadtriglyceridelevelsof110mg/dLorhigher.In2005-
2006,24.2%(95%CI,20.2%-28.7%)ofresearchparticipants
had triglyceride levels of 110 mg/dL or higher (2=0.30;
P=.72). In 1999-2000, 22.3% (95% CI, 17.5%-27.9%) of
research participants had HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or
lower. In 2005-2006, 23.5% (95% CI, 19.6%-27.9%) of re-
search participants had HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or lower
(2=0.28; P=.72). Finally, in 1999-2000, 15.5% (95% CI,
11.5%-20.4%) of research participants had a waist circum-
ference greater than or equal to the 90th percentile for age
and sex. In 2005-2006, 17.7% (95% CI, 14.3%-21.6%) of

Rates of adolescents exceeding cutoff points for fast-
ing plasma glucose levels changed over the 4 survey pe-
riods. When setting a cutoff point at 110 mg/dL, 0.7%
(95% CI, 0.2%-2.6%) of research participants in 1999-
2000 exceeded this level. In 2005-2006, 0.9% (95% CI,
0.4%-2.0%) of research participants had fasting plasma
glucose levels of 110 mg/dL or higher (2=0.26; P=.69).
However, when the cutoff point for the fasting plasma
glucose level was set at 100 mg/dL, 8.9% (95% CI, 6.0%-
12.9%) of research participants in 1999-2000 exceeded
this level. By 2005-2006, 18.4% (95% CI, 14.9%-22.5%)
of research participants had fasting plasma glucose lev-
els of 100 mg/dL or higher (2=24.59; P=.001).
Sex differences were observed in the rates of adoles-
cents exceeding cutoff points for individual compo-
nents of MetS. No differences in rates were detected in
2005-2006 for BP or triglyceride levels. However, boys
had higher rates (25.5%; 95% CI, 20.0%-31.9%) of fast-
ing plasma glucose levels of 100 mg/dL or higher com-
pared with girls (10.6%; 95% CI, 7.0%-15.5%) (2=30.24;
P.001). Boys had higher rates (27.8%; 95% CI, 22.2%-
34.2%) of HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or lower compared
with girls (18.7%; 95% CI, 13.8%-24.9%) (2=9.33;
P=.03). Finally, girls had higher rates (22.1%; 95% CI,
16.9%-28.4%) of waist circumference exceeding the 90th
percentile considering age and sex compared with boys
(13.7%; 95% CI, 9.8%-18.7%) (2=9.91; P=.02).
The prevalence of MetS did not change from 1999-
2000 to 2005-2006 (Table 3). We analyzed the preva-
lence of MetS with the 4 most common sets of criteria used
to define this syndrome in adolescence. Definition 1 (waist
circumference 90th percentile; BP 90th percentile; tri-
glyceride level 110 mg/dL; HDL-C level 40 mg/dL; and

and 7.2% (95% CI, 5.0%-10.2%) in 2005-2006 (2=0.08;
P=.85). Definition 2 (waist circumference 90th percen-
tile; BP 90th percentile; triglyceride level 110 mg/dL;
HDL-C level 40 mg/dL; and fasting plasma glucose level
100 mg/dL) resulted in a MetS prevalence of 8.6% (95%
CI, 5.7%-12.7%) in 1999-2000 and 10.6% (95% CI, 7.9%-

The prevalence of MetS has historically been higher for
adolescent boys compared with adolescent girls (Table 3).

prevalence of MetS among adolescent girls in 1999-2000
ranged from 2.1% (95% CI, 0.7%-6.2%) to 5.0% (95% CI,
2.2%-11.0%) depending on the criteria used.
For the survey period of 2005-2006, no significant sex
differences were reported for any set of criteria used to de-

COMMENT
This study examined selected clinical characteristics for
cohorts of similar adolescents over 4 survey periods from
1999-2006; examined changes in rates of adolescents ex-
ceeding cutoff points for individual components of MetS;
described sex differences in individual components of
MetS; described changes in MetS prevalence from 1999-
2006 using 4 common MetS definitions; and described
sex differences in MetS prevalence from 1999-2006. We
found increases in fasting plasma glucose and HDL-C lev-
els and decreases in diastolic BP when comparing the
2005-2006 cohort with the 1999-2000 cohort. Rates of
adolescents exceeding cutoff points for fasting plasma glu-
cose levels have increased. Compared with girls, adoles-
cent boys had higher rates exceeding cutoff points for fast-
ing plasma glucose and HDL-C levels. Adolescent girls
had higher rates exceeding cutoff points for waist cir-
cumference. The prevalence of MetS among adolescents
did not change from 1999-2006 regardless of the MetS
definition used. Finally, although boys have had histori-
cally higher prevalence rates of MetS compared with girls,
by 2005-2006 no sex differences were observed.
Specifically, girls are showing an alarming increase in
waistcircumference.Waistcircumference,ameasureofab-
dominal adiposity, has been associated with incidence of
cardiovascular disease in adults. In children and adoles-
cents, waist circumference has been identified as a predic-
tor of insulin resistance.30 In conjunction with body mass
index, waist circumference predicts coronary artery dis-
ease risk factors.31 Children with increased waist circum-
ference at age 8 years were 4 times as likely to have car-
diovascular risk factor clustering during adolescence than
those with smaller waist circumference.32 The increase in
prevalence of elevated waist circumference (90th per-
centile) in girls from 15.9% in the 1999-2000 data to 22.1%
inthe2005-2006dataiscauseforconcern.Cliniciansshould
measure body mass index and waist circumference and
should evaluate results using standardized growth grids.33
Elevations of central adiposity measures are reason to per-
form comprehensive screening for other health risks and
to apply appropriate interventions for lifestyle behaviors
such as diet and activity.
Rates of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels nearly
doubled from 1999-2006 for both boys and girls when
using 100 mg/dL as the cutoff value. The difference in
the prevalence of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels
using 2 different cutoffs is intriguing. Fasting plasma glu-
cose level, as any other criterion, can be viewed as a con-
tinuous variable rather than as a dichotomous variable.
It has been noted that we are lacking large prospective
studies that can determine the best cutoff for fasting
plasma glucose levels.23 At the very least, it seems logi-
cal to apply the cutoff of 100 mg/dL (rather than 110
mg/dL) for adolescents because the lower level is pres-
ently recommended for adults. When doing so, the re-
sults are startling. The prevalence of elevated fasting
plasma glucose levels increased from 0.7% to 8.9% in
1999-2000, from 2.4% to 13.1% in 2001-2002, from 0.9%
to 10.5% in 2003-2004, and from 0.9% to 18.4% in 2005-
2006 when using 100 mg/dL instead of 110 mg/dL. It is
also striking that when using 100 mg/dL for the cutoff,
boys showed an increase in the prevalence of elevated
levels from 12.5% in 1999-2000 to 25.5% in 2005-2006,
and girls showed an increase from 4.9% in 1999-2000
to 10.6% in 2005-2006. The reason for this increase in
elevated fasting plasma glucose levels is not clear but sug-
gests that adolescents are at higher risk for development
of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
The improvement in HDL-C levels in boys is encour-
aging. Even after adjustments accounting for increases
in HDL-C levels among NHANES samples in 2003-
2006, rates of adolescent boys exceeding the cutoff have
improved. The increasing levels of HDL-C have helped
to stabilize MetS rates and offset the increasing fasting
plasma glucose levels. Similar to fasting plasma glucose
levels, the more stringent HDL-C level of 40 mg/dL (rather
than 35 mg/dL) is helpful to the clinician. For example,
in 2005-2006 data, only 9.4% of boys and 7.7% of girls
had HDL-C levels of 35 mg/dL or lower, whereas 27.8%
of boys and 18.7% of girls had levels of 40 mg/dL or lower.
Sex differences do exist in the rates of individual MetS
components. In all of the 4 survey periods, higher rates
of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels were observed
in boys compared with girls. In the most recent survey
period (2005-2006), higher rates of central adiposity were
observed for girls compared with boys.
When examining the criteria collectively, the preva-
lence of MetS in adolescence was unchanged from the
survey periods of 1999-2000 through 2005-2006 regard-
less of the individual criteria used to define MetS. His-
torical sex differences were found in the rates of MetS,
with boys having significantly higher rates of MetS com-
pared with girls in 3 survey periods, whereas there were
no sex differences in the rates of MetS in 2005-2006.
Findings from the survey period of 1999-2000 fall
within prevalence rates for MetS previously re-
ported.14,15 Different inclusion and exclusion criteria in
the analyses by Cook et al,7 Duncan et al,8 and de Fer-
ranti et al9 explain their differences in subject numbers
and specific results. In some studies, adolescents who were
missing MetS criteria measurements were included; in
other cases, no exclusion was made for pregnancy or glu-
cose-altering medication use; in 1 case, a 6-hour fast rather
than an 8-hour fast enabled subject inclusion; and fi-
nally, in some studies a mean of all BP measurements taken
rather than the mean of all but the first (as recom-
mended by NHANES) was calculated.
Limitations of this study include those of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention sample itself, such as
sampling and laboratory errors. For example, sample
weighting for calculation of population totals are based on
US Census Bureau data. On the other hand, the stratified
probability sample of the NHANES data enables research-
ers to extrapolate the data to the entire population of US
adolescents. Levels of HDL-C were higher in the last 2 sur-
vey periods compared with the first 2 survey periods. It is

most likely that a change in methods was responsible for
the increase in HDL-C levels.27 Other covariates may ex-
plain some of the increased HDL-C levels but are unlikely
to account for most of the mean increases in HDL-C lev-
els. Further investigations are necessary to attempt to ex-
plain the increased HDL-C levels and provide further guid-
anceontheinterpretationofHDL-ClevelsfortheNHANES
1999-2006.27 Cross-sectional data such as NHANES pro-
vide a snapshot in time but do not aid in tracking specific
individuals for MetS over an extended period. An addi-
tional limitation is that subjects themselves provided the
information regarding medication use that led to study ex-
clusion.AuniversallimitationoftheworkonMetSforado-
lescents is that the definitions, criteria, and cutoffs are not
agreed on by consensus. However, this work contributes
to the understanding of individual criteria and cutoffs, the
elucidation of sex differences in specific criteria, and the
reporting of MetS prevalence over time.
Criteria for MetS individually and collectively can be
used to examine historical epidemiological trends and to
evaluate individual adolescents as part of a comprehen-
sive health care approach.
