Introduction
Business as Usual
A key change agent role is to help clients understand the sys-
tems to which they belong to help them improve some
aspects of individual, process, and/or organizational perfor-
mance. A major challenge is how to facilitate this under-
standing.Atypical strategy is to collect data and then provide
some kind of interpretation as to its meaning and significance
for the client organization. Every change agent knows that
while it is easy to interpret data, it is much more difficult to
get the client to own the interpretation and to act on it. This
is due, in part, because the author of the data (system agents)
and the reader (the change agent) live in different worlds and
come to different conclusions about the underlying meaning
of a set of data.
A Better Way
This is where PathMAP® comes into play. PathMAP® is an
interpretation strategy by which the authors of the data and
the reader of the data share a common language about what
the data mean because they are both members of the same
system for a brief time. PathMAP® is a process for engaging
agents within a system in the process of data interpretation.
What follows is a case study describing how this was done.
The purposes of the case study are to
·
· Introduce readers to PathMAP®.
·
· Show how it can be used to engage diverse groups in
interpreting survey data.
·
· Demonstrate that the results of a PathMAP® are an
increased understanding of the variables that influ-
ence system dynamics, an increased appreciation of
how they interact, and an increased understanding of
how to change the system.
PathMAP® enables the change agent to get an accurate
picture of the current state of an organization, as seen by sys-
tem agents, by identifying the key issues facing the organiza-
tion, understanding their interrelationship, and using this
knowledge to create meaningful action plans, plans that make
deep and intuitive sense to the organization's members. The
system influence mapping process of PathMAP® is
·
· Fast--It enables you to rapidly identify and address
the actual root cause of an issue and create a sustain-
able action plan in less time than traditional methods.

Engaging Employees in Interpreting
Survey Results: Using PathMAP® as a Tool
to Drive Understanding and Change
Keith Owen1, Norvell Northcutt2, and A. Steven Dietz3
Abstract
A key change agent role is to help clients understand the systems to which they belong to improve performance. A major
challenge is how to facilitate this understanding. Typically, the change agent collects the data and provides an interpretation
about its significance for the client organization. This approach, however, often meets with resistance. What is needed is
an approach that engages the author of the data in its interpretation and this article introduces just such an approach--
PathMAP®. A case study is used to introduce PathMAP® and show how it can be used to engage system agents in a rigorous
process of data interpretation leading to an increased understanding of the variables that influence system dynamics and of
how to engage the system in change. This article will demonstrate how PathMAP® enables change agents to get an accurate
picture of the current state of an organization by identifying the key issues facing the organization and their interrelationship,
and using this knowledge to create meaningful action plans that make deep and intuitive sense to organization's members.

Context of the Case Study
Background
The system depicted in this study is a large organization that
had been relatively unchanged for decades. Following a
series of financial setbacks, there was a mandate for creating
a more effective transparent, employee-oriented organiza-
tional culture. This mandate led to large-scale changes in the
organization and its leadership. A number of initiatives were
undertaken to transform the organization including one to
realign the organization around a new set of values. Senior
leadership team felt it was appropriate to survey the organi-
zation to find out what employees felt and to gather their
opinions on how things were working.
To accomplish this, a census survey was undertaken to
benchmark the current organization and identify indicators
to track goal-oriented progress. To design the employee sur-
vey, a series of employee interviews were conducted, the
analysis of which enabled the research team to identify a
number of variables for assessment, including confidence in
senior leadership, degree of transparency, valuing employ-
ees, empowerment and participation, relationship with
supervisor, teamwork, and measures of satisfaction and com-
mitment. Items to assess each of these variables were devel-
oped and the resulting survey was then administered to
employees via the Internet. Two weeks after data were col-
lected, a preliminary report was provided to senior manage-
ment and following this presentation, interactive feedback
sessions were commenced.
Findings of the Survey
Quantitative analysis of the survey data revealed a number of
interesting yet contradictory findings. First, employees indi-
cated they were highly committed to the organization, were
proud to be a part of it, and wanted to remain employees for
the foreseeable future. However, survey results also indi-
cated a number of potentially threatening issues held by
employees:
·
· There was little confidence in senior management.
·
· There was little trust for those in leadership roles.
·
· It was perceived the organization did not genuinely
care for or value its employees.
·
· There was very little openness.
·
· HR systems were rated unfavorably, especially related
to pay and compensation, performance management,
and due process.
While employees reported they were highly committed to
the organization, they also felt as if they were not valued by
the organization. In short, employees felt victimized and
underappreciated. Because the data were so unfavorable in
most respects, the research team used PathMAP® as a means
of engaging employees in a nonthreatening, open environ-
ment for the purpose of interpreting the data. To better under-
stand why PathMAP® was used as it serves as a great tool
for clarifying the underlying causes of these issues. Following
is a brief discussion of the theories underlying PathMAP®.
Organizations as Phenomenological
Systems
PathMAP® is a systems approach to a kind of qualitative
research called "grounded theory" which has three major
characteristics:
·
· It is a phenomenological approach, meaning that it
represents a phenomenon from the perspective of
those experiencing the phenomenon (the emic view-
point), rather than from some external or imposed per-
spective (the etic viewpoint). In this particular case,
the employees of the organization were asked to
become active participants in the interpretation of
their own survey data, in contrast to the more tradi-
tional approach of the external observer or researcher
who conducted the survey determining the meaning
of the data.
·
· PathMAP® representation is based on systems theory,
which means that phenomena as perceived by a par-
ticular constituency are represented as systems. These
phenomenological systems, like all systems, have two
components:
|
|
Elements: a group of closely related constructs
that can be given a single name.
|
|
Relationships Among Elements: the perceived pat-
terns of influence or causation.
·
· Consequently, the phenomenon can be represented as
a system map that shows how the various elements of
the system are connected, in the minds of a constitu-
ency, in a pattern of influence. This representation
creates a number of different interpretive possibilities,
the most important of which are as follows:
|
|
An understanding of the relative "importance" of
the system elements, depending on their place-
ment within the system map and how they are
interconnected to other elements.
|
|
An opportunity to ask "what if" questions that can
lead directly to implications and suggestions for
improvement. These questions are of four kinds:
·
· Prospective: We can describe the existing states of the
drivers of the system (elements that determine the
Owen et al. 3
states of all or most of the other elements of the sys-
tem) and determine the likely effects on the outcomes
(elements whose states are largely determined by
other elements within the system).
·
· Retrospective: We can describe a hypothetical desir-
able set of outcomes and "work backwards" through
the system map to determine what set of precondi-
tions the system must obtain to reach the desirable
state.
·
· Internal dynamics: We can examine the internal
dynamics of the system, typically in terms of the
effects of feedback loops (recursive cycles of influ-
ence among a set of elements in which a change in the
state of one element creates a cycle, usually self-rein-
forcing), to better understand, for example, how
changes in one element may "rebound" throughout
the entire system in often surprising ways.
·
· External dynamics: We can examine the effects of
hypothetical elements external to the system; for
example, "At what juncture in the system or what
would be the resulting internal dynamics if a class-
action lawsuit were filed by the customers of the
organization?"
Furthermore, PathMAP® is a process by which a constit-
uency (a group of people who are similar in distance from
and power over a situation and therefore may be presumed to
have a relatively homogeneous understanding of the situa-
tion) defines their own collective understanding of a phe-
nomenon as a system consisting of clusters of meaning and
relationships among those clusters.
Four major theoretical streams of thought inform the
PathMAP® research process (Northcutt & McCoy, 2004):
·
· Grounded Theory. The purpose of grounded theory
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967) is essentially the classical
empirical task of inferring patterns or regularities (a
theory) from a mass of observations. The theory thus
induced is not a grand metanarrative that makes
claims about how humans make meaning regardless
of context, but is more modest in its goals in that it is
fairly highly constrained by the contextual limits of
the observations themselves.
·
· Phenomenology. Phenomenology is usually attributed
to Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), but also has a sig-
nificant intellectual provenance going back to
Emmanual Kant (1724-1804), who first argued that
the structure of the mind (consciousness) determined
to a significant degree the nature of reality itself.
Husserl, following Kant's lead, advocated that the
proper focus of philosophy ought to be phenomeno-
logical in the Kantian sense, which led to a major
movement in psychology that emphasizes the subjec-
tive experience, rather than the experience as inter-
preted or understood by an external observer.
·
· Systems Theory. The "father" of systems theory is
generally recognized to be Karl Ludwig von
Bertalanffy (1969). PathMAP®, while not subscrib-
ing to many of the implications of von Bertalanffy's
theorizing about biological systems, is certainly one
example of many applications of his ideas to social
systems in that PathMAP® represents social phenom-
ena as systems consisting of elements and relation-
ships among these elements; furthermore, these
relationships are neither random nor willy-nilly, but
are systemic, meaning that they follow a consistent
internal logic or structure.
·
· Hermeneutics. The classical hermeneutical model that
was refined into its highest form by the Scholastics of
the high Middle Ages provides the intellectual foun-
dation for the entire PathMAP® research process
(Dietz, 2010). The tripartite hermeneutical model of
author­text­reader is used as a metaphor and a guide
for the research process itself.
PathMAP® and Hermeneutics
While the concepts implied by systems theory and phenom-
enology are widely familiar, the appearance of "hermeneu-
tics," traditionally reserved for religious texts, may be a
surprise. We use the term in its wider sense of interpreting
any text at all, whether the "text" be a book, an interview, or
a set of observations. In other words, all human activity that
involves symbolic exchange is grist for the hermeneutic mill.
HowdoesthishermeneuticalprocessapplytoPathMAP®?
Taking the word text literally, the hermeneutical model,
which is a three element system consisting of the text, the
author, and the reader, raises the following issues or
questions.
·
· What is the intent of the author; or alternatively, is the
intent of the author even a legitimate concern?
·
· Does the text "speak for itself"?
·
· What, if anything, does the reader bring to the herme-
neutical task? Is the reader simply a mechanical
"recorder" of the text, in which case all readers would
be expected to derive the same meaning from the
same text? Or is the meaning of the text entirely
dependent on the reader's subjective reaction to it?
Furthermore, as the reader has no immediate access to
the writer's consciousness or intent, what part does
authorial intent play in the model?
These questions have been debated for decades and no
doubt will continue to be points of contention. Different
"schools" of literary criticism and of social "science" inquiry
clearly tend to privilege one apex of the hermeneutical tri-
angle over another (Figure 1). This article is not the place for
a detailed examination of how different disciplines of social
inquiry privilege either the author, the text, or the reader, but
4 SAGE Open
it is important to understand how PathMAP® uses the her-
meneutical model as a metaphor, and how PathMAP® rec-
ognizes that each of the three apexes should be emphasized
or privileged, depending on the stage of development of the
research study.
First, the "author" is not the researcher; rather, the author
is the person or group that the researcher is "studying"; that
is, the researcher's job is to understand the meaning of a phe-
nomenon in the terms of the "subjects" of the study. As the
researcher has no direct access to the consciousness of the
subjects, she or he must depend on some kind of "text,"
whether the text comprises interviews, focus groups, sur-
veys, or any of the variety of ways that social researchers
"gather data."
The researcher is the hermeneutical reader; the "subjects
of the study" are the authors, and the text is whatever means
the researcher uses to make inferences about the meaning of
the phenomenon to the subjects. Once understood in this
way, a conclusion seems to emerge quickly: It is not a matter
of choosing which of the three apexes to privilege; rather, an
effective research methodology must privilege the appropri-
ate element at the appropriate stage of the research project
in such a way as to achieve some kind of balance. PathMAP®
achieves this balance in the following way:
·
· Research Design. The earliest phase of research, that
of deciding just what will be the subject of inquiry,
must of necessity privilege the "reader" (the
researcher). It is the researcher who decides to con-
duct the project and process being used in the first
place.
·
· Data "Collection" or Observation. This phase, if the
purpose of the study is to represent the emic dimen-
sion of a phenomenon, must of necessity privilege the
author (the subjects).
·
· Analysis or Data Aggregation. This stage should priv-
ilege the "text" (the data). This objective accom-
plished by making a clear distinction between analysis
and interpretation, a distinction that is made clear by
ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, analysis
is deductive and rule- or algorithm-driven.
·
· Interpretation privileges first the reader--after all, it is
the obligation of the researcher to tell an audience
what she or he thinks the study means--and then the
"author," in that the subjects can and should be brought
back into the study to help create and interpret what
their own mind map means--a participatory praxis.
PathMAP® is structured to recursively privilege each of
the three apexes of the hermeneutical triangle in a systematic
way under the assumption that doing so will provide the
most credible and robust description and interpretation of the
phenomenon. Indeed, the application of PathMAP® method-
ology to the organization is an example of how robust the
methodology is.
Overview of the PathMAP® Process
Figure 2 shows the structure of a typical PathMAP® study. A
short discussion of the steps in this diagram is given, fol-
lowed by a description of how the process was adapted for
the present study.
PathMAP® studies begin with a focus group in which the
group brainstorms their reactions to an issue statement or
some general stimulus (in the case of the organization, this
was the results of the employee survey). The results of the
brainstorming session are invariably a large number of
thoughts. Members of the group, with the researchers acting
as neutral facilitators, engage in three kinds of "coding" or
synthesis/analysis of the data represented by the cards:
·
· "Open" coding which results in a categorization of the
author's thoughts. The major point here is that the
authors are creating their own categories, rather than a
set of categories being imposed by a third party.
·
· "Axial" coding (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), the purpose
of which is to clarify and to define the range of mean-
ing for each of the elements.
·
· "Theoretical" coding, after all affinities are identified,
the facilitator queries the author group about their per-
ception of the influences among all affinities. This is
worthy of note because (a) this level of coding is typi-
cally missing from many qualitative studies, (b) theo-
retical codes are the source material for transforming
a simple laundry list of affinities into a true system,
and (c) once again, the judgments of relationships are
made by the authors, not the reader.
In a more robust PathMAP® study, the list of system ele-
ments provides the structure for an interview protocol in
which individual members of the constituency are inter-
viewed to provide more in-depth understanding of the phe-
nomenon (represented in the right-hand track of Figure 2).
The present study used only the focus group track. After the
focus group has completed the element production and an

analysis of relationships among all possible pairwise ele-
ments, PathMAP® provides a formal set of protocols or
algorithms that are used to analyze the system relationships.
These protocols are strictly deductive and the implication is
that once a set of theoretical codes has been produced, differ-
ent researchers will produce the same system. By separating
analysis from interpretation, IQA eliminates a common
source of confusion in qualitative studies. The final product
of a PathMAP® study is a system map. The map represents
the elements and their relationships as a coherent system,
starting with drivers and ending with outcomes from which
conclusions and implications are drawn.
Using the PathMAP® Approach
Feedback sessions were designed such that the participants
in each group were relatively homogeneous with respect to
status.
Process
Data presentation. The data presented below reflect the out-
put from eight PathMAP® group sessions. Each group had
12 to 15 participants and each session was run according to a
prearranged script. First, the facilitator welcomed partici-
pants and discussed the aims and ground rules for the ses-
sion. The rules included, confidentiality of the discussion, no
talking during brainstorming and clustering, and freedom to
move the cards at will. These rules were strictly reinforced
during the feedback sessions. Second, a summary of the
group and the overall survey data were presented. This pre-
sentation highlighted the 10 most and least favorably rated
items for the location as well as the scores for each factor
measured by the survey. If a given location had any score
that was significantly higher or lower than the overall score
for that factor and/or item, these scores were highlighted and
discussed. This was done to show that some of the results
were specific to a given location and some were more sys-
temic in nature.
Issue identification.After answering any questions about the
data, participants were asked to silently think about the fol-
lowing question: "What are the issues that produced the sur-
vey results we have just presented?" The group then engaged
in a silent brainstorming process during which they wrote
their thoughts and feelings on post-it note cards, one thought/

feeling per card. These cards were collected and posted by
the facilitator on a large white board. Each group generated
an average of 15 cards per participant. For this study, these
cards provided the narrative for understanding the meaning
and effectiveness of each element.
Clustering and naming.Following the brainstorm, partici-
pants silently clustered the issue cards into affinities, groups
of cards believed to have the same underlying meaning. Par-
ticipants could move cards about ad libitum until there was
agreement regarding the particular group into which a given
card was placed. Once all the cards were clustered, each
cluster was discussed. This discussion was led by a volunteer
from the group. The result of this discussion provided each
group of cards (an element) with a unique label. The label
captured the underlying meaning of each element.
Establishing the relationships among elements.After the nam-
ing was done (Table 1) the facilitator led the group in a pair-
wise assessment of the relationship among the elements
during which participants had to decide which element
caused the other.
Valencing. After the naming exercise, participants were asked
to evaluate the quality of each element of the system as posi-
tive, neutral, or negative.
Analysis of Data
Step 1: Construction of the interrelationship table (IRT).To
facilitate construction of the system map, the judgments of
the relationships among system elements are summarized in
an Interrelationship Table (IRT) as shown in Table 2. This
table has been sorted horizontally in descending order from
drivers to outcomes. Each of the elements is listed in column
1, its relative rank is shown in column 2, and the column
labeled  reflects the difference between the number of "in"
arrows subtracted from the number of "out" arrows (no. of
outs - no. of ins = ). The element with the greatest number
of "outs" is called the primary driver, the one with the next
most a secondary driver, and so on. The box with the greatest
number of "ins" is called the primary outcome and the box
with the next most number of ins is called a secondary out-
come, and so on. A given element can be a driver, an out-
come, or both. Drivers and outcomes can further be
deconstructed into primary, secondary, tertiary, and so on
depending on their relative position in the chain of
influence.
Step 2: Construction of the system map.The data from the
IRT were used to construct the system map as shown in
Figure 3.
Using the rules of simplification, the pattern of relation-
ships is reduced in complexity so that it is more easily inter-
preted. This process produces a system map that is
1. entirely consistent with the data; that is, there is no
link in the IRT that is not represented, either directly
or indirectly, in the system map likewise, there is no
link in the system map that is not in the IRT.
2. the simplest possible representation of the IRT con-
sistent with Criterion Number 1; that is, it meets the
requirement for parsimony.
In short, this simplification process is entirely consistent
with the two basic criteria of any good theory.
Step 3: Interpretation of the system map. There are three main
outputs from a PathMAP®:
·
· The elements identified by participants,
·
· The underlying name of constructs which explain the
meanings of the element to participants, and
·
· The interrelationships among the elements, that is, the
system map.

Owen et al. 7
The system map reflects the shared understandings and
meanings attached to the observations and experiences of
employees working for the organization. People in this orga-
nization understood this influence map to be the "truth"
about the reality of the current organizational culture. In
other words, the data correspond to the facts as experienced
by the participants, thus they were empirically true. Second,
the data were in agreement with the "rules of conduct" as
agreed on by the participants, that is, they were coherent with
the values espoused by the participants. Finally, the data
were true from a pragmatic perspective in that the partici-
pants were in almost 100% agreement the data portrayed the
inner dynamics of the organization.
What this means is that the system map reflects the cate-
gories and linkages that belong to the individuals who cre-
ated them. Likewise, all the relationships perceived by the
constituents are included in the structure of the system map.
In other words, the system map contains nothing that is not
the data. The system map thus represents a coherent theory
from which hypotheses can be derived and tested. With this
in mind, let's consider the meanings inherent in the system
map and their relationship to existing theories and data
related to organizational effectiveness.
The final system map shown in Figure 3 reflects the rela-
tionships among the issues identified by employees. The
boxes are the elements of the system, and the meaning attrib-
uted to each (i.e., the element's name) is derived from the
cards generated by participants. The arrows show the direc-
tion of the influence, from cause to effect. The amber color
reflects the fact that each element was evaluated as having a
negative valence. The names of the affinities have been
changed to reflect this evaluation. The system map is inter-
preted from left to right.
In the broadest sense, this system map tells us that
employees of the organization believe a vicious cycle of inef-
fective leadership (Vicious Cycle 1) causes a cycle of distrust
(Vicious Cycle 2). In fact, the perceived lack of leadership
competence was seen to be the cause of a host of related
problems, including unfair pay, a lack of leadership direc-
tion, unclear or ineffective policies, and lack of growth
opportunities. These problems interact with one another and
create an arc of distortion or certainty gap between what is
said and what is delivered. It is this arc of distortion that
causes the cycle of mistrust and suspicion to evolve.
McDonald, Kessel, and Fuller (1972) found there are three
components to trust: self-disclosure, competency, and
respect. He found that trust evolves in an atmosphere of
transparency but only when leaders can effectively carry out
their message and only when their execution enables people
to meet their work needs for autonomy, purpose, mastery,
and belonging. Clearly, in this organization, senior leader-
ship was perceived not to be transparent, competent, or
caring.
This cycle of suspicion and mistrust "caused" or led to
what employees referred to as the Loss of Leadership
Integrity. No one in a position of power was believed to be
willing or able to look out for the best interests of employee
and,overtime,thiscausedorledtoFeelingsofPowerlessness.
Finally, these feelings of powerlessness created the final out-
come of a Climate Apathy.
With these general comments in mind, let's take a more
detailed look at the system map. The first thing that stands
out in the map is its structure, which has three distinct seg-
ments. The first segment reflects a closed loop feedback
involving four drivers: board management, a lack of leader-
ship skills, ineffective human resource policies, and poor
communications. These four affinities form a closed feed-
back loop that reflects a vicious cycle--the cycle of leader-
ship incompetence. Vicious means that the loop produces a
range of negative and unintended consequences, the over-
arching effect was the belief that leaders, especially senior
leadership, were believed to be incompetent.
The influencers comprising the first segment produced or
caused a second closed feedback vicious cycle--the cycle of
distrust--which also comprised four affinities: a lack of con-
fidence in leaders, ineffective policies and procedures, lack
of career development opportunities, and unfair promotions
and raises. The cycle of distrust led to or caused the final seg-
ment of the map--the belief in this organization that leader-
ship lacked integrity which led to the development of feelings
of powerlessness. This perceived powerlessness resulted in
the development of feelings of apathy and resignation.
Now let's interpret each segment of the map and discuss
the implications of each for the effectiveness of then
organization.
Segment 1: The Cycle of Leadership
Incompetence
Figure 4 shows that the Cycle of Leadership Incompetence
comprised four affinities: the perceived ineffectiveness of
the board of directors and its policy making, the lack of

leadership skills, ineffective human resources systems (HR)
and processes, and poor communications. These four affini-
ties interacted to create a closed feedback loop that eventu-
ally led to the perception that the organization was essentially
leaderless. The hiring of a new CEO was created with the
expectation that the work environment would show signifi-
cant improvement in openness and transparency and in the
way employees were treated; instead, just the opposite
occurred. The day to day experiences generated by the new
leadership team were perceived to be at variance with the
values espoused by them and not to be in the best interest of
employees.
Ineffective board management drove lack of leadership
skills.Figure 5 shows the relationship between board man-
agement and lack of leadership skills. The board had replaced
the previous CEO, who had been very dictatorial, a person

debate, with a CEO believed to be very employee centric. On
the surface, the new GM appeared to be a good fit with the
organization, but his practices turned out to be aloof, uncom-
municative, and most problematic, indecisive. In addition,
rather than getting rid of the old guard leadership, the new
GM decided to retain many of them. This led to the percep-
tion of a lack of leadership skills, and, in the minds of
employees, it was ineffective board management that resulted
in a failure to hire a GM who had the competencies required
to lead the organization out of the turmoil in which it was
mired.
Lack of leadership skills drove ineffective HR policies. One of the
manifestations of ineffective leadership was ineffective HR
policies (see Figure 6). By HR policies, we refer to the deci-
sions related to getting people into the organization, develop-
ing, promoting, empowering, recognizing and rewarding
them, and providing them due process. Policies are only
effective if they are designed, implemented, and carried out
properly, which was not believed to be the case. In fact, there
was no policy regarding career development nor was there a
policy regarding salary advancement. In addition to this, the
HR staff was believed to represent senior management and
not employees.
Ineffective HR policies drove perception of poor communica-
tions. It is not likely a function that is perceived to be ineffec-
tive would be perceived to communicate openly; thus, it was
not surprising that HR was believed to be misleading in its
communications. With regard to their role implementing and
enforcing relevant HR policies and procedures, HR was
believed to be very ineffective (Figure 7). The organization
was rife with miscommunication about what the policies and
procedures were and they were believed to be unevenly and
unfairly implemented across the organization.
Poor communications drove the perceived ineffective board man-
agement. Finally, poor communications between HR and the
employees as well as between leaders and employees further
exacerbated the general belief that the Board was ineffective
(Figure 8). Uniformly, employees felt they had no input into
the formulation of board policy nor any access or channel to

voice their concerns to the board. This led to the belief the
Board was not the least bit interested in looking out for
employees' interests and were thus unwilling to help them
resolve major issues they had with members of the leader-
ship team.
A study by Owen, Culbertson and Mink (2004) provided
a view of the cycle of leadership incompetence. In this study,
the aim was to examine the relationship between employee
outcomes and leadership practices. Figure 9 (adapted from
Owen et al., 2004; Wiley & Brooks, 2000) shows the
relationship model that was the outcome of this study. The
main point is that when leaders are perceived to be compe-
tent, the result is that employees are enthusiastic about their
jobs and the organization; when not, employees are apathetic
and lack energy--and this is what we observed in the current
organization.
The four elements described above interacted in a vicious
cycle to cause a related vicious cycle, the cycle of distrust
(Figure 10). The means by which this seems to have hap-
pened was the frequent breaking of agreements, the lack of
Figure 8. Poor communications reinforced perception of board mismanagement.

transparency, and the lack of alignment between words and
deeds.
Segment 2: The Cycle of Distrust
The cycle of distrust (Figure 11) was created by the interac-
tion of four affinities: lack of confidence in leaders, ineffec-
tive policies and procedures, lack of career development
opportunities, and unfair rewards and recognitions. These
factors are in a constant state of interaction and this creates a
self-reinforcing cycle that consistently communicated the
message that leaders were not able and/or willing to provide
employees fair rewards and recognition, which thus rein-
forced the lack of confidence in leadership.
This interpretation is supported by the work of McDonald
et al. (1972) who found that at the behavioral level, trust is
determined by the degree to which leaders are transparent,
keep their commitments, and ensure employees' health and
safety. Underlying these behavioral manifestations of trust
are leaders' intentions and competence. When leaders
consistently go back on their word and consistently fail to
deliver on their promises, employees start to question their
true intentions and/or their ability to execute their intentions.
Winter, Owen, Read, and Ritchie (2010) showed that an
important determinant of safety excellence was the degree to
which employees had confidence in leaders to execute the
safety strategy. In other words, safety results were influenced
by the degree to which employees perceived their leaders to
be competent and to genuinely care about their safety.
Lack of confidence in leaders drove ineffective policies and proce-
dures. Lack of confidence in leadership and the lack of clear
policies and procedures concerning promotions and salaries
both had the same number of ins and outs (see Table 2). This
underscores the fact that in an organization, management is
responsible for developing policies and procedures that take
care of employees'needs, especially with respect to develop-
ing, rewarding, and treating employees equitably. These
three concepts are central to employees being able to meet
their needs at work. This was not taking place in the current

organization. Policies and procedures were hopelessly obso-
lete and were seen to be unfair to employees. More impor-
tantly, they were seen to be at variance with the promises of
the new management team. Instead leaders regularly said
one thing and did another. For example, employees were
promised a cost of living raise; however, this decision was
suddenly reversed without explanation. This decision vio-
lated the espoused value of transparency. Employees came to
believe the values were no more than a publicity gimmick of
the new leadership team (Figure 12).
Ineffective policies and procedures drove lack of career develop-
ment opportunities.There was a total lack of policies and
procedures regarding career growth in the organization. This
was in part due to the history of the organization--the orga-
nization was very stable for many years. In any case, no clear
policies regarding career development existed, nor was there
a career ladder for any position. As a result, employees felt
trapped into a completely arbitrary process that was con-
trolled by a manager, whom they typically did not trust to
have their best interest at heart (Figure 13). This lack of a
career path meant that employees perceived themselves as
locked into a pay grade indefinitely.
Lack of career development opportunities led to unfair promo-
tions and pay raises. The fact that there were no adequate or
meaningful policies and procedures regarding career growth
meant that there was no rational basis for giving employees
promotions or pay raises. In the past, this had not been a
problem, for every year each employee got a cost-of-living
adjustment and this seemed to have sufficed; however, in the
midst of the current financial crisis caused by the outgoing
CEO, the cost-of-living adjustment was eliminated and
promised raises were delayed. The effect of this was an
intense feeling among employees they were not being treated
fairly or equitably. Research by Sirota, Mischkind, and Melt-
zer (2005) showed that equitable treatment is the single most
important determinant of satisfaction with an organization.
When employees perceive a lack of equity, they become
intensely dissatisfied with their organization and many, if
given the opportunity, will leave the organization. Unfortu-
nately, for the employees of this organization, leaving was
not a generally viable option and this led to the further ero-
sion of confidence in leaders (Figure 14).
Lack of promotions and pay raises eroded confidence in leaders'
competence.Figure 15 shows the relationship between the
lack of promotions and raises and the loss of confidence in
leaders. There was more than 90% agreement among the
rank and file employees that senior and middle-level man-
agement in this organization could not be counted on to do
what was right for employees. Research shows that when
employees do not feel as if they are valued by their organiza-
tion, they develop feelings of hostility and/or despair. Fur-
thermore, they begin to feel trapped. Ironically, at this
organization, employees felt an intense loyalty to their cus-
tomers and this loyalty amplified the already intense level of
anxiety and anger toward the organization and its leaders.
The cycle of distrust produced what employees referred to
as a loss of perceived integrity. In effect, senior leaders (and
the board) were perceived to have betrayed the covenant that
had long defined the relationship between employees and the

organization (Figure 16). Dictionary.com defines integrity as
"adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of
moral character." Leadership was perceived to lack this
moral character. It was not that they were believed to lack
character per se but that they lacked the ability to fulfill their
promises. As a result, each day, employees would come to
work and expect to be treated with indifference.
Segment 3: The Perceived Loss of Integrity
Created a Sense of Powerlessness and Eventually
Apathy
Leadership incompetence was believed to produce a cycle of
distrust which was perceived to result in a loss of organiza-
tional integrity and eventually feelings of powerlessness and
apathy. This set of relationships represents the third segment
of the system map.
Self-fulfilling prophecies. The first element in Figure 17 repre-
sents a generalized expectation. An expectation is a psycho-
logical prediction that something will occur. The effects of
such expectations have been widely researched. For one
thing, it is known that expectations tend to be self-fulfilling
(Bandura, 1997). If I believe that leaders have little integrity,
and if I believe there is nothing I can do about it, then I tend
to act in accordance with this set of beliefs. Furthermore, I
tend to see only those features of the environment that rein-
force this belief (this is referred to as belief bias).
Let's look at this phenomenon from the perspective of
motivation theory. A widely accepted theory is that people
bring to work each day three basic needs: achievement,
belonging, and respect (Pink, 2009; Schwartz, 2009; Sirota
et al., 2005). Each day, the organization and its leaders create
a range of experiences, some of which provide an opportu-
nity to meet these needs, through the job, through relation-
ships with others, through the character of the organization,
and so forth, and some of which do not. At our subject orga-
nization, employees found it impossible to meet these needs.
This state of affairs leads to the predictable effects of learned
powerlessness. Learned powerlessness has three compo-
nents. Cognitively, it is the belief that there is nothing
in one's power that can be done to meet one's needs;

Figure 16. The cycle of distrust led to the perceived loss of integrity.

emotionally, it is the expectation of failure; and behaviorally,
it is acting in a manner that is consistent with the belief.
Figure 18, adapted from Mink, Owen, and Mink (1993),
illustrates the self-fulfilling nature of beliefs and the expecta-
tions and actions that are created as a result.
Feelings of powerlessness lead to apathy and resignation.There
was 100% agreement among our PathMAP® groups that the
current climate of the organization was characterized by low
trust and high fear. This emotional state was the experience
of a majority of employees who worked for this organization
(Figure 19). Bandura (1997), in his pioneering research on
the determinants of self-esteem, found that three conditions
activate expectations: self-efficacy (I can), response efficacy
(I'll be successful), and outcome expectation (I'll get some-
thing I value). In the organization, the latter of the three con-
ditions was lacking. No matter how hard one worked or how
well one performed, there was no commensurate reward or
recognition. In fact, many believed wages were kept deliber-
ately low.
A Disconnect Between Effort and
Outcome
Seidman (2007) showed that when people fail to see a rela-
tionship between effort and outcome, a generalized expecta-
tion of powerlessness and learned helplessness develops (the
response is elicited by a wide array of situational cues that
bear some degree of similarity to the original cue). For exam-
ple, when my effort consistently fails to produce an increase
in pay, I come to doubt all my interactions with an
organization.
Much has been written about the vicious cycle of distrust
in organizations as opposed to a virtuous cycle of trust. The
research by Gibb (1978) and his students sheds the most
revealing light on the root causes and effects of the cycle of
trust versus mistrust. According to Gibb, there are two pri-
mary processes available to any human interaction: an open-
ing and a defending process. Which of these becomes part of
an organization's culture depends on the level of trust and
transparency perceived to characterize the organization
Figure 17. Relationship between leadership integrity and congruence.
Figure 18. Beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.
Owen et al. 15
(Table 3). In a trusting environment, opening is the norma-
tive process and a positive inner work life the outcome. In a
distrusting environment, defending is the normative process
and a negative work life the outcome. Clearly, in our "sub-
ject" organization, defending was the norm.
What are the effects of this climate? We can think of
effects in terms of the short term and the long term. In the
short run, employees feel betrayed by the company's leader-
ship. The implicit covenant between employees and the orga-
nization was one based on the belief the organization would
look out for its employees; this covenant was broken when
employees were consistently treated as if they were not
valued.
In the long run, the betrayal employees experienced was a
violation of what McDonald et al. (1972) called contract
trust (unilaterally breaking an agreement). From the victim's
point of view, a betrayal of trust produces shock, disappoint-
ment, and eventually a reevaluation of one's belief system.
This is because every betrayal makes the victim look back
over their past to try to determine what caused it. This reflec-
tion almost inevitably leads to self-blame and guilt.Although
employees may express anger and indignation at not being
treated well, underneath this anger, there is a loss of self-
worth, of feelings of efficacy and the ability to control one's
environments and produce outcomes that will enable people
to meet their needs. This path between betrayal and unwor-
thiness is how deception causes so much damage. Because
betrayal causes the victims to feel bad about themselves,
they are hit twice--first, the social contract has been broken
and second, they think poorly of themselves.
Betrayal, then leads to and reinforces feelings of power-
lessness as the victims come to believe there is no way they
can fix the situation. Such powerlessness leads to what
Harvey (1988) referred to as anaclitic depression--the loss
of the sense of self at work that is caused by a separation or
loss. Sometimes the loss of power leads to fantasies of
revenge. The movie "Inglorious Bastards" demonstrates this
fantasy. As Daniel Mendelsohn (2009) said, "Tarantino
indulges this taste for vengeful violence by--well, by turn-
ing Jews into Nazis." Being passive is so painful that we
often want to turn passive into active. The victim becomes
the perpetrator. More often than not, in the workplace, the
loss of power leads to apathy and resignation.
What Can Change?
Clearly, there is a need for change in this organization. The
question is what should be changed. When answering this
question, two issues must be analyzed. First, while it might
be tempting to focus on Low Integrity, by designing a feed-
back system and holding those in leadership roles account-
able for how they are perceived, doing this might turn out to
be akin to treating the symptom and not the disease. It may
produce a short-term relief from the pain, but it may not
eliminate the root cause of it. One could expect the disease to
worsen over time, even though its symptoms may not be as
obvious. The fact is this element is the predictable outcome
of other more pernicious issues at work in this system. The
best strategy, all else equal, is to focus on drivers as close to
the primary driver as possible.
The decision as to which driver to focus on is, in part,
determined by the driver's malleability. Dictionary.com
defines this concept as adaptable or tractable such as the mal-
leable mind of a child. Malleability, then, refers to which of
the primary drivers are most susceptible to change. Based on
this concept, we propose the most obvious intervention is to
strengthen the leadership capability of the system. Figure 20
shows a system of leadership development that bridges the
gap between the lack of confidence in leadership and the
cycle of distrust. This system is based on a study of best prac-
tices in leadership development conducted by the Research
Board of the Corporate Leadership Council (2004). As can
be seen, the process starts with the development of behavior-
ally based leadership descriptions. By focusing on what lead-
ers are expected to do as opposed to focusing on some

abstract trait or style, it is possible to create expectations and
standards that are actually observable and measurable. This,
then makes it possible to formatively evaluate current role
occupants and provide them coaching and mentoring prior to
holding them accountable for their practices.
Conclusion
This article presents an in-depth look at an organization with
deep systemic issues that need to be addressed in order for
the organization to move forward in a healthy manner.
PathMAP® was used, in conjunction with a quantitative
employee survey, to take this deep look into the inner dynam-
ics of this organization. While the organization has a unique
context and culture, it is not alone in having problems;
PathMAP® can be fruitfully used in other organizations to
create a shared understanding of organizational reality and
how to make significant improvements in organizational
functioning. PathMAP® can be used to identify the mallea-
ble elements that can be manipulated to improve the organi-
zation and to generate heuristic validity for the solution.
PathMAP® reflects a recent evolution of organizational
assessment tools that have a heritage in the work of Deming
and others (for a representative list of such tools, see
Cambridge University Institute for Manufacturing, n.d.).
This heritage is important. Organizations today are inher-
ently more complex than the manufacturing environment of
1950s Japan. The tools used by organizational experts must
keep pace with the complexity of the organizations they are
trying to assist. PathMAP® provides a stable systemic pic-
ture of influencers in the organization and provides a picture
of empirical truth (correspondent truth) as perceived by those
living it day to day. It provides a picture that allows practitio-
ners (both internal and external) to compare the "truths"
from the population of authors and come to a shared sense of
validity for the organization.

was used to accomplish three important aims from the per-
spective of the change agent:
·
· Involving stakeholders in interpreting the data they
authored.
·
· Deepening understanding of the system of which the
participants are a part.
·
· Facilitating the design and execution of change and
transformation.
What makes PathMAP® so useful and powerful in
accomplishing these three aims? There are a variety of rea-
sons, both pragmatic and theoretical.

·
· It builds commitment.
·
· It provides a picture of system influences and effects
and thus provides a qualitative estimate of concurrent
validity (in comparison with survey multivariate
analysis).
·
· It provides a picture of empirical truth (correspondent
truth).
·
· It provides a picture of the coherent truth as it allows
us to compare the "truth statements" from the popula-
tion of authors.
The case study is an important initial step in exploring
PathMAP® as a tool for better understanding the systemic
influences that affect an organization; however, there are two
cautions to take away from this study. First, the PathMAP®,
like any other point in time assessment, is just that--a point in
time. It is obvious that the organization continues to move in
dynamic ways that are unpredictable to some extent. That being
said, after a first series of interventions are conducted, it would
be important to conduct a subsequent PathMAP® to determine
the effectiveness of the interventions. Second, there is clearly
need for more focused research to be conducted on PathMAP®
process, results, and the effectiveness of organizational inter-
ventions that come from an interpretation of the results.
