Abstract
Purpose of the Study:Research shows that parents benefit psychologically from gen-
erativity--giving and caring for the next generation--but older adults' perceptions on
giving support to their children are rarely if ever explored in these studies. The current
study examines the association between the support that aging parents give to one of
their middle-aged offspring, their perception of this support as rewarding or stressful,
and their levels of depressive symptoms.
Design and Methods: The sample draws from The Family Exchanges Study and consisted
of 337 older parents (mean age: 76) who were drawn from a larger study of middle-aged
adults (i.e., target participants). Older parents reported tangible and nontangible forms
of support given to the target middle-aged child and the extent to which they viewed
providing such support as stressful and/or rewarding.
Results: We found significant interactions between tangible support and feelings of
reward and between nontangible support and feelings of stress in explaining parental
depressive symptoms. Parents who found giving support to be highly rewarding had
lower levels of depressive symptoms when giving high amounts of tangible support.
Conversely, parents who view giving support to be highly stressful had higher levels of
depressive symptoms when they gave low amounts of nontangible support.
Implications: Findings suggest older parents' perceptions of supporting their offspring
may condition how generativity affects their mental health.

Parents serve as a consistent source of support for their
adult children, frequently providing advice, practical assis-
tance, and financial transfers (Bucx, van Wel, & Knijn,
2012; Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009). Although
age may condition the types of support that parents give
to their children (Bucx et al., 2012; Hartnett, Furstenberg,

Fingerman, & Birditt, 2012), it seems that even when their
children are grown, many parents continue providing vari-
ous types of support. Yet, few studies have explored how
giving different types of support to adult offspring impact
aging parents' depressive symptoms (Liang, Krause, &
Bennett, 2001).
Several studies have found that adults regularly
engage in and psychologically benefit from generativity.
Generativity refers to a concern for establishing, guiding,
and contributing to the welfare of future generations (An
& Cooney, 2006) and is commonly manifested within the
family through tangible support exchanges (Fingerman
et al., 2009) and transmission of values (Pratt, Norris,
Hebblethwaite, & Arnold, 2008) or outside of the fam-
ily through volunteerism and societal engagement (Son
& Wilson, 2011). However, it is enacted, generativity has
many implications for health in later life. Greater percep-
tions of generativity are associated with fewer activities
of daily living disabilities (Gruenewald, Liao, & Seeman,
2012). Other research shows that providing emotional sup-
port may also act as a double-edged sword: Contributing
to the positive emotions of others is associated with fewer
depressive symptoms, whereas listening to the problems and
conflict of others is associated with an increase in depres-
sive symptoms (Strazdins & Broom, 2007). Providing more
types of support is associated with greater well-being for
older adults, whereas providing support to a greater num-
ber of family members was negatively associated with well-
being (Thomas, 2010).
Previous research has generally distinguished between
instrumental and emotional support (A. S. Rossi & P. H.
Rossi, 1990; B. A. Sarason, I. G. Sarason, & Pierce, 1990;
Vaux, 1988) as having unique functions and serving dis-
tinct purposes. Providing emotional support predicts
greater self-esteem and control beliefs among elderly
adults with comorbid health conditions (Warner, Schuz,
Wurm, Ziegelmann, & Tesch-Romer, 2010). Provision of
practical support through volunteerism and civic engage-
ment is associated with higher quality of life for older
adults (Wheeler, Gorey, & Greenblatt, 1998). The psy-
chological functions of giving each type of support have
yet to be thoroughly explored in the context of family
exchanges (Gutierrez, Tomas, Galiana, Sancho, & Cebria,
2013).
The purpose of this study is to examine how giving
different types of support to adult offspring is associated
with the mental health of aging parents and whether per-
ceiving giving support as stressful or rewarding moderates
the association between giving support and depressive
symptoms. By examining these associations, we can bet-
ter understand possible psychological implications and
motivations of generativity in later life. We can also gain
a sense of how different forms of support are associated
with psychological well-being of older parents. By focusing
on the giver, rather than the receiver of support, this study
adds a unique perspective to research on generativity and
for understanding associations between parental giving and
mental health in late life.
Providing Support and Mental Health
Parents are perhaps the most obvious source of support
for children when they are young, however as children
mature into adults, parents remain an important support
system, providing instrumental, financial, and emotional
help (Bucx et al., 2012; Fingerman et al., 2009). These gen-
eral patterns of support are enacted in many ways includ-
ing household chores, transportation or shopping, giving
information, discussion of important life decisions, visiting
or sharing of leisure activities, assisting with personal care,
giving advice, exchanging services, or providing financial
assistance (Eggebeen, 1992; Lin, 2004; Silverstein, Gans,
& Yang, 2006).
Taken as a whole, the existing literature concerning
family support exchanges demonstrates many forms of
support that can be conceptualized as tangible and non-
tangible support. Tangible support represents material,
instrumental, or concrete support given or received by an
individual. Nontangible support assesses a psychologi-
cal and emotional form of support that is not measured
through material transfers. Both forms of support remain
important in our understanding of generativity and family
support exchanges, however they are indeed distinct and
examining how these forms of support differ may prove
insightful to existing research.
Literature suggests that parents benefit psychologi-
cally from giving different types of support to their chil-
dren, at least in cultures that place a high value on family
and collectivism (Cruza-Guet, Spokane, Caskie, Brown,
& Szapocznik, 2008). For example, Chen and Silverstein
(2000) found that among older Chinese parents, provid-
ing personal support--such as housework or babysit-
ting--to adult offspring was associated with better morale,
whereas providing financial assistance had no effect on par-
ent morale. In Western cultures, the experience of giving
instrumental or financial support may be distinct from the
experience of giving more nontangible, emotional types of
support. In the United States, parents who provide financial
and instrumental support to grown children may do so in
response to their children's needs (Fingerman et al., 2009)
and may experience stress and negative emotions in doing
so. By contrast, providing emotional support may occur
in the context of loving relationships where those giving
support may feel positive emotions as a result of the sup-
port they give to others. Thus, it is plausible that how one
perceives the support exchange moderates the association
between giving and mental health.
The present study sought to give insight into how aging
parents' perceptions of giving support to an adult child
are associated with depressive symptoms. We examined
how the experience of giving support as either rewarding
or stressful moderated the potential impact that giving
The Gerontologist, 2015, Vol. 55, No. 5 771
tangible and nontangible support has on depressive symp-
toms of older parents. Of course, in a cross-sectional study,
patterns of association may be reversed, and people who
are in better mental health may perceive less stress in pro-
viding support. Nonetheless, theory suggests that providing
the support and conditions for providing support may have
implications for mental health outcomes, and we tested this
theory here. Further, we considered tangible and nontangi-
ble support as distinct types of support. We hypothesized
that parents who perceive giving support to be highly
rewarding would report lower levels of depressive symp-
toms when they gave high amounts of support. Likewise,
we anticipated that parents who perceive giving as highly
stressful would have higher levels of depressive symptoms
when they are giving high amounts of support.
Methods
Sample
Data were utilized from The Family Exchanges Study (FES;
Fingerman et al., 2009). FES recruited a target sample of
633 middle-aged adults (M = 50.60, SD = 4.99) who had
at least one living adult child and at least one living parent
in 2008. These participants were identified through phone
lists from Genesys Corporation and random digit dialing
from the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical
Area (PMSA) including urban, rural, and suburban areas
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Participants completed
1-hr long Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATIs)
regarding relationships with their grown offspring and liv-
ing parents. These target participants provided the names
and contact information of their living parents.
From the original sample of middle-aged adults, 280
(44%) had parents who agreed to be interviewed. In 223
cases, one parent was interviewed, and in 57 cases, both
parents were interviewed, which yielded 337 dyads of
parent and target offspring. This paper utilizes data from
this sample of 337 older parents. The parent sample com-
pleted CATIs similar to the interviews completed by the
target child. These interviews lasted 30
min on average.
Parents answered questions about each of their living chil-
dren including the target child from the original sample.
Questions focused on exchanges of support, beliefs about
relationships with children, and other demographic infor-
mation. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the parents
interviewed for this study. Participant age ranged from 59
to 96 (M = 76.07, SD = 6.32). About 69.4% of participants
were female and 30.6% were male. Parents answered many
questions about each of their grown children, but they only
provided ratings of the target child for a subset of questions
regarding rewards and stress of providing support. Thus,
this study focused on ties to the target child. The target
children differed from other children with regard to gender
and age; target children are more likely to include daugh-
ters (2 = 11.12, p < .01) and older children (t = -4.88, p <
.001), compared to other children.
Measures
Support Given to Adult Offspring
The study used six items from the Intergenerational Support
Scale (ISS; Fingerman et al., 2009), which measures how
frequently parents report giving different types of support
to each of their children: companionship, talking about
daily events, emotional support, practical support, giving
advice, and financial assistance. Participants rated how fre-
quently they provided these types of support to their living
adult children on an 8-point scale ranging from 1 (less than
once a year or not at all) to 8 (daily).
For the purposes of this study, we grouped these items
into two general types of support: tangible and nontan-
gible support. As presented in Table 2, each type of sup-
port was examined separately before being categorized as
either nontangible or tangible support. Tangible support
was established by computing the mean of practical sup-
port and financial assistance (two items), which repre-
sents material or concrete support (i.e., fixing something
around the house, running an errand, providing a ride,
giving money, loaning money, and helping to purchase
goods, services, insurance, or education). Nontangible
support is the mean score of emotional support, com-
panionship, talking about daily events, and advice (four
items), which assesses a psychological and perhaps more
subtle form of generativity (i.e., listening to concerns or
being available when a child is upset, helping with a deci-
sion or providing suggestions about things they could
do). The resulting measures of the two types of support

are consistent with prior studies (e.g., A. H. Rossi & P. S.
Rossi, 1990; Silverstein et al., 2006). The reliabilities of
the support measures were 0.52 for tangible support and
0.75 for nontangible support.
Depressive Symptoms
We assessed depressive symptoms of parents, using five
items from the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a 53-item
self-report scale (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983), which
measures depressive symptoms commonly observed in eve-
ryday settings. Parents rated to what extent they felt lonely,
blue, worthless, hopeless about the future, or had no inter-
est in things, using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at
all) to 5 (extremely). Individual depressive symptom scores
were established by computing the mean score of these five
items ( = 0.78).
Perceptions of Giving
To account for parents' perceptions of giving support, we
included both a measure of stress and a measure of reward
in our analysis. Parents rated: (a) how stressful they found
giving support to the target child as well as (b) how reward-
ing they found giving support to the target child. The
answers were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not
at all) to 5 (a great deal).
Control Variables
We controlled for three demographic characteristics of
older parents associated with mental health or support
exchanges: age, gender, and self-rated health. Amount of
emotional support exchanged between parents and chil-
dren has been found to decrease with parent's chronologi-
cal age (Keyes, 2002). We also controlled for parent gender
(coded 1 for male and 0 for female) because previous
research shows that mothers and fathers have very differ-
ent relationships with their children (Burholt & Wenger,
1998). Because self-rated health has shown a strong associ-
ation between mental health and physical health in old age
(Efklides, Kalaitzidou, & Chankin, 2003; Kay & Bergman,
1966; Zubenko et al., 1997), we also included self-rated
health for the past 12 months as a control variable. Self-
rated health was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent). On average, participants rated their
health to be good (M = 3.07, SD = 1.12).
In addition to demographic variables, we controlled for
the mean levels of tangible and nontangible support given
to all children to ensure that results were not influenced by
other relationships than the target child within the family.
We also chose to control for the number of children so that
family size did not condition the amount of support that
a parent was able to give to the target child. Less positive
relations with children have been found to be related to
low levels of parent well-being (Ward, 2008). Also, the rela-
tional quality between the parent and the child may affect
how parents provide support (Fingerman et al., 2009).
Thus, we controlled for relational quality between the par-
ent and their target child rated on a 5-point scale from 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent) in the model.
Analysis Strategy
Multilevel regression models were conducted to predict
the level of depressive symptoms of older parents, using
the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS (Littell, Milliken,
Stroup, & Wolfinger, 1996). The multilevel models take
into account the nested nature of the data and handle cor-
related error in parents from the same families (n = 114).
The predictors included two types of support given to
the target (i.e., tangible and nontangible) and two percep-
tions of giving support (i.e., giving is stressful and giving
is rewarding). After centering variables, we also computed
possible interactions between support given and perceptions

of giving support. We did this to examine whether viewing
support as stressful or rewarding moderates the association
between the support that parents give and parental depres-
sive symptoms. We present the significant interaction terms,
trimming nonsignificant interaction terms. We controlled
three parental characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and self-
rated health), relationship quality with adult offspring, and
three family characteristics (i.e., number of adult children,
tangible support given to all children, and nontangible sup-
port given to all children) in the analyses.
Analyses focused on four research aims: (a) revealing
the patterns of tangible and nontangible support that aging
parents provide to their child, (b) examining how parents
perceive giving support to the target child (as stressful or
rewarding), (c) describing the association between giving
support and depressive symptoms of older parents, and
(d) understanding how perceptions of giving as either a
stressful or rewarding experience influences the association
between providing tangible and nontangible support and
depressive symptoms.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
We first examined how frequently participants provided
support to their offspring and how they perceived the sup-
port that they give to the target child (Table 2). The most
frequent forms of support parents provided were talking
about daily life (M = 5.71, SD = 1.77) and emotional sup-
port (M = 4.86, SD = 2.18). Parents reported providing
practical support (M = 3.39, SD = 2.28) and financial sup-
port (M = 2.01, SD = 1.53) least frequently. When these
individual forms of support were categorized into tangible
and nontangible support, nontangible support was more
frequently provided (M = 4.72, SD = 1.48) and tangible
support was provided less often (M = 2.69, SD = 1.60).
Parents reported their perceptions of giving to the tar-
get child as either stressful or rewarding. As shown in
Table 2, feelings of reward were relatively high (M = 4.29,
SD = 0.89). In contrast, parents indicated a lower level of
stress surrounding giving (M = 1.59, SD = 1.09).
Gender differences in the levels of support provided and
perceptions of giving are also reported in Table 2. Overall,
mothers reported giving nontangible support more fre-
quently than fathers. However, giving tangible support and
perceptions of giving did not differ by gender.
Regarding depressive symptoms among parents (data
not shown in table), participants reported relatively low
levels of depressive symptoms (M = 1.45, SD = 0.63). We
did not find gender differences in the level of depressive
symptoms.
Table 3 shows correlations of all predictor variables.
Tangible support and nontangible support given to the tar-
get child were significantly positively correlated as was tan-
gible and nontangible support given to all children. Other
significant correlations include the correlation between

stress and tangible support given to the target child and all
children as well as reward and relational quality with the
target child.
Multilevel Models for Depressive Symptoms
Multilevel regression examined the association between
giving support and levels of parental depressive symptoms
(Table 4). We found two significant interactions associated
with depressive symptoms. First, the interaction of feel-
ings of reward and giving tangible support was significant
for depressive symptoms (B = -0.05, p < .05). To examine
this interaction, we first categorized participants as feel-
ing high stress or low stress and giving high nontangible
or low nontangible by fixing them to +1 SD and -1 SD
from their mean. After categorizing parents as feeling high
or low reward and high or low tangible support, we found
that parents who found giving support to be less reward-
ing showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when they
are providing more tangible support (Figure 1). In contrast,
greater tangible support was associated with lower depres-
sive symptoms among people who found support highly
rewarding.
Second, we also found a significant interaction effect
between stress and giving nontangible support on depres-
sive symptoms (B = -0.05, p < .01). Parents who found
giving support to be highly stressful had fewer depres-
sive symptoms when they give more nontangible support.
However, parents who reported lower levels of stress had
higher levels of depressive symptoms when they are giving
more nontangible support (Figure 1).
Two interactions were not significant including the
interaction between stress and tangible support as well as
the interaction between reward and nontangible support.
Among the covariates, only self-reported health was sig-
nificant, with better subjective health associated with fewer
depressive symptoms.
Discussion
Perceptions of giving tangible and nontangible support
to adult children may have psychological implications for
aging parents. Giving may increase feelings of generativity,
which leads to these effects on mental well-being. Although
past research shows that giving support declines with age
(Keyes, 2002), our data show that parents frequently pro-
vide both tangible and nontangible support to their grown
children. Furthermore, a clear pattern of giving emerged
from this sample: Parents reported providing nontangi-
ble support more frequently than tangible support. These
results were somewhat intuitive because tangible forms of
support (e.g., financial and practical assistance) are finite,

whereas nontangible forms of support (e.g., emotional sup-
port and advice) are not necessarily limited by the material
or physical resources available.
It is likely that the age of parents in our sample played
a role in the types of help that they are able to provide
their children. For example, older parents may be on a fixed
income that may prevent them from providing frequent
financial support to their adult children. Although we con-
trolled for self-reported health, other physical limitations
may prevent parents from providing practical assistance to
their children; assisting with driving or household chores
may not be possible for older parents. Conversely, older
parents possess many life experiences that contribute to
their ability to give nontangible support to their grown off-
spring. After experiencing many life events, older parents
may feel inclined to share knowledge and advice with oth-
ers, especially to their children.
The data also confirm that while parents provide differ-
ent types of support to their grown offspring, this support
is coupled with feelings of both stress and reward, albeit
stress levels were low on average. The negative correlation
between stress and reward (Table 3) suggests that parents
may harbor specific attitudes pertaining to the support that
they give. Although participants reported higher levels of
reward than stress, our results do in fact indicate that pro-
viding support to adult offspring is interpreted and expe-
rienced in unique ways in different families. Although we
were unable to measure levels of stress and reward for spe-
cific types of support, our analysis indicates that perception
of giving as a whole is a valuable consideration for inter-
generational family support exchange research.
Consistent with previous research on giving support
to a loved one (Inagaki & Eisenberger, 2012), our results
indicate that the provision of support may be beneficial to
parents and may promote a sense of purpose or satisfaction
from being able to continue helping one's children, in effect,
what Erikson described as generativity (Erickson, 1963).
But giving support by itself was not sufficient. Rather, par-
ents' perceptions of giving and the type of support that they
provide their offspring have a significant association with
depressive symptom levels. The mental health implications
associated with giving support to grown children take on

a new and important meaning when analyzed within the
context of how parents perceive the experience of giving.
Within our sample, viewing giving as a highly reward-
ing experience moderates the association between parent
depressive symptoms and tangible support. When feelings
of reward were high, parents who gave low amounts of
tangible support had higher levels of depressive symp-
toms, whereas parents who gave high amounts of tangible
support had lower levels of depressive symptoms. In con-
trast, parents who did not view giving as highly rewarding
reported higher levels of depressive symptoms when they
gave high amounts of tangible support. In both of these
cases, we see that depressive symptoms are more frequent
when the level of reward (low/high) a parent feels is incon-
sistent with the amount of tangible support that they actu-
ally give (low/high).
When examining interactions between stress, nontan-
gible support, and depressive symptoms, we see different
results. Parents who view giving as a highly stressful experi-
ence have the highest levels of depressive symptoms when
giving low amounts of nontangible support to the target
offspring. Although giving may be a stressful experience,
the long-term implications for providing support seem to
persist when a parent is giving nontangible support to their
child. Perhaps providing low amounts of nontangible sup-
port indicates that there are few opportunities to make such
contributions to a child's life and fulfill parental duties.
Interestingly, parents who view giving as highly stressful
and gave high amounts of nontangible support had fewer
depressive symptoms. These somewhat paradoxical find-
ings are consistent with reports by Strazdins and Broom
(2007) that giving emotional support can increase depres-
sive symptoms, when the support is given in the context of
problems or conflict. It is possible that parents who find
giving nontangible support stressful and give high amounts
of support are more engaged generally with their child and
have opportunities to address both problems and positive
issues in their child's life, whereas parents giving a little
support are drawn in only when there are problems.
Barriers to providing tangible and nontangible support
are plentiful; providing tangible assistance may be outside
the means of many elderly parents while some adult chil-
dren may refuse or not welcome nontangible support from
their elderly parents. Conversely, giving a lot of nontangi-
ble support even when it is stressful to do so is associated
with fewer depressive symptoms than giving a little sup-
port. Further study is needed to determine factors that lead
to feelings of stress in giving nontangible support and how
the amount and type of support given affects well-being.
Implications and Conclusions
This study provides potential directions for future research
concerning intergenerational relationships,familial support,
and depressive symptoms in older parents. Specifically, our
results indicate the potential to focus on the psychological
perceptions of giving support. This study provides unique
insight into the implications of generativity; older parents
may provide support not only because their children benefit
from receiving support, but also that it may fulfill feelings
of parental obligation. Thus, it may be wise to consider the
role that parental obligation plays in future studies pertain-
ing to parental generativity.
These findings support the notion that social and behav-
ioral factors may improve the mental health and quality of
life of older adults (Glymour & Osypuk, 2012) and raise
important questions concerning the role that support given
by older adults plays outside of the family context. Results
also suggest that depending on their perceptions of giving,
older adults may benefit from making tangible or nontan-
gible contributions to younger generations. Thus, future
research concerning intergenerational support exchanges
could be utilized in the planning and implementation of
health promotion programming for older adults. One such
program, Experience Corps, has proven to be quite suc-
cessful in improving physical and cognitive activity in older
adults as well as educational outcomes for children (Fried
et al., 2004). A greater understanding of how intergenera-
tional social relationships may impact mental health in late
life is greatly needed in order to establish health promotion
programming and interventions for this population.
Some limitations warrant comment. Limitations of
giving support must be taken into consideration such as
resources available to parents and the needs of offspring.
These variables were not considered in the present analysis
but should be considered in future research. Another limi-
tation is that our data only capture the support exchange
relationship between a parent and one of their adult chil-
dren. Expanding analysis to focus on support exchanges
between older parents and all of their children would reveal
interesting insight into within and between family differ-
ences concerning generatively. Our analyses are limited,
in that, reports are only provided by a parent which may
bias our results in some respect. Thus, it would be useful
to examine both children's and parent's reports of support
exchanges and their perspectives of giving different types
of support. Another limitation is the low rates of depres-
sive symptoms among the parents in our sample. Although
the skewed depressive symptom measure did not prove to
be problematic in our analysis, it would be beneficial for
the depressive symptoms measure to reflect a normal dis-
tribution. These limitations should inform future research
with the ultimate goal of strengthening our understanding
of intergenerational support exchanges.
