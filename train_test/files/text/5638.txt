It was hypothesized that there would be differences between
legislators and superintendents across four constructs: Equity
and Adequacy, Personal Values, Political Ideology, and
Social Influence. Several demographic variables were evalu-
ated. While the study did not yield as many differences as
expected, it is conclusive that important differences do exist;
the results are important because school funding decision
makers must find common ground to equitably and ade-
quately fund education for every child.
Introduction
School finance is not a new problem in the United States nor
is it a new problem in the state of Alabama. It has been in
existence and evolving since the beginning of public educa-
tion. During the 2004 democratic presidential primaries,
Senator John Edwards struck a chord with voters and educa-
tors when he spoke of "two Americas: one for the wealthy
and privileged, another for those not so lucky" (Bartolomeo,
2004).
Likewise, since the beginning of the school finance
debate, researchers have found spending differences between
tax-wealthy school districts and those poorer districts with
limited tax capacity. Students and schools may be short-
changed in the quality of education because of the lack of
financial resources. In a study of New York City schools,
Bartolomeo (2004) analyzed the inequities teachers and stu-
dents experienced due to the funding divide. Bartolomeo
found that poorer districts in New York had higher turnover,
fewer textbooks, more unsafe conditions and older buildings
when compared with their wealthier counterparts elsewhere
in the state. Class sizes in the poor districts were 30 to 35
compared with the wealthier districts' class sizes of 15 to 25.
The results of this study provided evidence that a strong tax
base resulted in more funding, afforded better programs,
higher quality textbooks and more manageable class sizes.
Asimilar study found that the majority of students who are
classified as having the greatest needs and a higher cost to
educate tend to live in poor districts (Moran, 1999). These
costly students more often than not reside in property-poor
districts; this creates a greater obstacle for district leaders to
generate sufficient local taxes to meet their educational needs.
School finance in Alabama presents problems similar to
those in other parts of the country. Many believe that current
funding issues in the education system are rife with inequity
and the lack of equal opportunity for students from different
socioeconomic classes (Crawford, 2004). Moran (1999)
attributed the lack of opportunities to the differences in funds
collected by the individual school districts. These problems,
while not new, remain unsolved.
In Alabama, the budgeting process is spelled out in state
law. Specific taxes are designated to the Education Trust
Fund, which funds education in the state. These are primarily

Abstract
This study was undertaken to examine the differences in school funding perceptions between Alabama school superintendents
and legislators. The overarching purpose was to determine areas of agreement and disagreement so that intermediaries
working with both of these groups can help public policy makers make the best education funding decisions through the
legislative process.

sales tax and income tax, which both fluctuate with the state's
economy. When the economy is growing, there tends to be
additional revenue. When the economy slows down, the
Education Trust Fund has a hard time meeting existing finan-
cial obligations.
The Alabama Education Trust Fund provides the financial
resources that support the legislatively approved minimum
educational programs for each district and each student
throughout the state. Any additional program offered by a
district that is above and beyond what the state mandates is a
result of the expenditure of local tax dollars. Some districts
have the potential to generate greater amounts of local taxes;
therefore, they can offer enriched learning opportunities over
tax poorer districts.
Local school districts have very limited authority to
impose additional taxes for educational purposes without
first gaining full support of the Alabama Legislature.
Statewide legislation only allows county commissions to
levy limited county and district school taxes. If a district
wishes to exceed that amount, they must secure a three-fifths
vote of the House and Senate delegation to have a proposed
constitutional amendment placed on a ballot for a statewide
vote, and then a majority of state voters is required for its
passage. As a result, funding for education in Alabama relies
heavily on legislators and local superintendents who work
with legislators to determine funding priorities. The deci-
sion-making process of these groups of individuals is influ-
enced by internal and external factors that affect their belief
systems. This study investigates how these belief systems
influence the decisions of legislators and superintendents.
Literature Review
Funding
The politics of school funding tend to blend philosophical,
social, and economic differences into a structure recognized
as "free public schools." It is impossible to separate educa-
tion funding from resources. The level of funding drives not
only the quantity but also the quality of resources available
to create public educational opportunities.
The success or failure of schools is strongly connected to
the financial support made available to them through the
levying of taxes and the allocation of revenues (Harvey,
1989). In this regard, major legal decisions have occurred in
Alabama affecting the educational funding throughout the
state. To understand where the state is today, it is important
to know where it was in past years.
Historical Events in Alabama That Held Funding
Implications
Three major legal decisions that affected education fund-
ing in Alabama have all centered on the state's right to
define what is appropriate legislative support of school
funding.
The 1950s were an extremely volatile time in Alabama
history. In an attempt to avoid desegregation of public
schools, the Alabama Legislature amended the 1901
Constitution in 1956 (Harvey, 2000). This amendment has
served as the basis upon which the State of Alabama pro-
vides funding for schools based on its available revenue. It
also eliminates any obligation to the needs or quality of those
educational opportunities (Harvey, 2000).
Since the 1950s, proration of educational funding has
been a major factor in the history of Alabama. Proration in
the Education Trust Fund has been declared 17 times since
1950; 15 times it continued until the end of the fiscal year, an
average of once every 3.66 years.
The second legal factor that continues to influence legisla-
tion and policy decisions in Alabama was the 1973 ruling by
theU.S.SupremeCourtonthecaseofSanAntoniov.Rodriquez,
where the court ruled that public schooling was not a right
guaranteed under the United States Constitution (Schrag,
2004). This ruling essentially assigned obligations for any kind
of an education to the states, where it remains today.
The third and most significant legal factor that trans-
formed the state funding scheme from what was known as
"The Minimum Program," prior to 1995, to the current fund-
ing scheme known as "The Foundation Program" was
Alabama Coalition for Equity v. Hunt (1993). In an effort to
more clearly define the state's obligation to provide equita-
ble and adequate educational opportunities, 33 school sys-
tems sued the State of Alabama in Ace v. Hunt (1993). This
court action resulted in the creation of a declaration in which
the judge stated, "that education is a fundamental right under
the Alabama Constitution." This ruling forced the legislature
to adopt a different method of distributing state funds (Ward
& Sauser, 1997).
The final disposition of this case was never completed to
the extent of defining and implementing a funding scheme
based on a set of defined outcomes, as many similar cases in
other states were able to accomplish. Instead, it ended in
2002. While considering a totally unrelated educational mat-
ter, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that it was not the
court's responsibility to insure equity and adequacy of the
schools in Alabama. According to the Court, that responsibil-
ity rests in the authority of theAlabama legislature (Siegelman
v. Alabama Association of School Boards, 2001). This ruling
established the legal precedent that legislators control the
funding of public schools.
The major outcome of these three cases was that the legal
responsibility for school funding rests with the states. States
have a responsibility to provide equitable education for all
citizens, and legislators control the allocation of funds for
schools. Thus, legislators are the key to school funding
equity in the state.
The Evolution of Adequacy
Historically, states have focused on how to allocate funding
across school districts. Calculating revenues and how they
Pouncey et al. 3
are distributed to school districts are complicated issues and
difficult to understand. Recently, the focus has changed from
equity to adequacy and over the past 30 years, state courts
have played a significant role in shaping education finance
policy. Legal challenges to finance formulas have been
brought in 45 of the 50 states (Smith & Pettersen, 2002).
Many of the early cases centered on "equity." Equity was
defined as funding every child throughout the state in an
equal manner (Smith & Pettersen, 2002). Alabama changed
its funding distribution method in 1995 to accomplish this
type of equity. Known as the "Foundation Program," the
funding scheme dictated the distribution of state dollars
equitably on a per pupil or per teacher basis to every district
in the state (Whitney, 1998).
In a report released by Public Affairs Research Council of
Alabama (PARCA), Williams (2006) reported that a founda-
tion program tries to do three things:
1. Define the components of an adequate K-12 educa-
tion and the cost of providing them to ensure that
every student, no matter where he or she lives, has an
adequate educational opportunity.
2. Encourage an appropriate level of local tax support
for every public school system to promote local own-
ership and to recognize the benefits of good schools
to the community.
3. Distribute state funds in a way that meets these objec-
tives so that everyone pays a fair share of the burden
of supporting high-quality public schools throughout
the state.
Alabama's Foundation Program was established to com-
bine both state and local funds to support the standard educa-
tional program defined by state laws. These resources are
made available to every local school system, in the following
way: First, the resources necessary for the standard program
are calculated. In Alabama, these are defined in terms of
numbers of teachers and other professionals, plus amounts
for their salaries and fringe benefits, five types of classroom
instructional support and other operating expenses. These
components are then summed to determine the allocation to
each school system for the cost of the foundation program.
Second, a minimum level of local tax support is required for
every school system. The idea is that the local community
should pay a fair share of the cost of the foundation program.
In Alabama, every school system must contribute 10 mills of
local property tax support to the foundation program. This
produces more local funds per student in some school sys-
tems than in others, primarily because property uses and val-
ues vary across the state. Third, the local share is subtracted
from the defined cost of the foundation program. The remain-
der is paid by the state. The subtraction is larger for school
systems in communities that have the ability to raise large
sums locally. This means that the state pays a smaller share
of the cost of the foundation program for such "wealthy"
systems, and a larger share of the cost where local taxing
capacity is low. The subtraction therefore helps to ensure that
the foundation program is affordable in every community
across the state (Williams, 2006).
PARCA's report (Williams, 2006) on Alabama's
Foundation Program validated the benefits of this method of
funding schools. Prior to the adoption of the Foundation
Program, the state distributed its funds to school systems
with very little consideration of local tax capacity.
The Budgeting Process
In the budgeting process, the State of Alabama requires that
the state superintendent develop a budget proposal for con-
sideration for the State Board of Education. Once adopted,
the budget is submitted to the Governor, who then makes it
part of the budget proposal that is presented for approval to
the Alabama Legislature. The legislature can approve it in
whole, or they may choose to modify various segments of the
proposal.
The budgeting process has become increasingly complex.
As states attempt to establish some form of equity in school
funding, many factors complicate the process. Differences in
local tax capacity continue to allow some school districts to
provide more services than others. The addition of standards
and a means of measuring whether a district has met those
educational standards have heightened the awareness of a
need for adequacy. The connection of standards to funding
further adds to the complexity of the budgeting process.
State's Role and Components of an Adequate
Funding Scheme
In the past, states have allocated funds across school dis-
tricts, each of which has different tax bases, in a manner to
achieve some level of parity. States have paid far less atten-
tion to the results each district has produced (Hunter, 2004).
In a review of literature on school finance, Theobald
(2000) listed the following three goals for any proposed
change to a state's education finance system: (a) education
finance systems should facilitate a substantially higher level
of achievement for all students, while using resources in a
cost-effective manner; (b) education finance systems should
facilitate efforts to break the nexus between student back-
ground characteristics and student achievement; and (c) edu-
cation finance systems should generate revenues in a fair and
efficient manner. In many states, the responsibility has been
placed on legislators to determine performance goals and
establish funding accordingly. Alabama has yet to embrace
that obligation.
Models for Adequate Spending Levels
Since the 1983 publication of A Nation at Risk (Education
Commission of the States, 1983), there has been a growing
4 SAGE Open
recognition by policy analysts, policy makers, and the courts
that an equal distribution of resources will not close the
achievement gaps among ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
This is particularly true if the amount of resources distributed
equitably is not sufficient to provide the instructional
resources required to eliminate those gaps. Thus, consider-
ation of equity issues increasingly has been approached from
the perspective of adequacy (King, Swanson, & Sweetland,
2005). Other researchers have elaborated by blending suffi-
ciency with desired outcomes in defining adequate financing
as sufficient resources to provide students with the opportu-
nity to achieve adequately defined levels of knowledge and
skills (Guthrie & Rothstien, 2001).
There are four primary models used to determine ade-
quate educational spending levels, including the Professional
Judgment Model, the Successful Schools Model, the
Advanced Statistical Model, and the Evidence-Based
Approach Model (King et al., 2005). These four models can
provide policy makers options for considerations that utilize
measurable means to better address a true understanding of
adequate resources.
The Professional Judgment Model brings a group of edu-
cators together to define the components needed to establish
a prototype school that, in their opinion, will have enough
resources to enable a specified percentage of students to
meet established standards (King et al., 2005). The cost of
those resources is then estimated to ascertain an adequate
level of funding. The professional judgment model is the
only method that has been fully implemented by a state.
Wyoming conducted a study using this method and, as a
result, the legislature approved a plan that cost US$6,050 per
student each year (Odden, 2003). The main advantage of this
approach is that spending levels for adequacy can be esti-
mated in the absence of a sophisticated student assessment
system. It is easy to explain to the public, and the resulting
estimates are based on the judgments of professional educa-
tors with experience in educating students.
The Successful Schools Model looks at all schools in the
state and identifies the ones that are meeting the state-
approved standards. The amount of money these schools are
spending becomes the adequate funding level for the state
(Picus & Blair, 2004). However, flaws have been identified
in this model. For example, the model bases its recommenda-
tions on only a few educational standards and fails to account
for many of the other important functions of a good educa-
tion (Picus & Blair, 2004). According to Odden (2003),
because atypical districts are usually eliminated when using
this approach, the result is often based on average-sized non-
metropolitan districts that are demographically homoge-
neous and spend below the state average. The successful
school district approach does not specify a way to make
adjustments for characteristics of individual districts, leading
to potential disagreements over how to meet the needs of
many students, especially those with high needs.
The Advanced Statistical Model represents the most tech-
nically complex model. This approach attempts to estimate
how much money would be needed to attain a certain level of
student performance, while controlling for the characteristics
of the district and its students.Anumber of important insights
about relationships between inputs and outputs may be
gleaned from cost function analyses. Many of these insights
can be used to inform policy and help determine the magni-
tude of adjustments for students and district characteristics
(Picus & Blair, 2004). Proponents believe that with enough
information on education expenditures and student charac-
teristics, statistical techniques can determine the funding
needed to meet education standards (Smith & Pettersen,
2002). The primary concern with this model is its complex-
ity; lawmakers and the public in general are very suspicious
of complex models and may mistrust the final calculations
(Picus & Blair, 2004).
The final method used to determine "adequate" funding is
the evidence-based approach. This model relies on current
educational research to identify resources needed for a proto-
typical school to meet the state's student performance stan-
dards (Picus & Blair, 2004). Once identified, those
specifications are subject to the "professional judgment" of
officials in the state to validate the research-based recom-
mendations. These costs are then estimated and applied to
actual schools in the state. One drawback is the fact that
research-based models will not always work in absolutely
every situation (Picus, 2000).
Spending for Improvement in Student
Achievement
In considering the aforementioned funding models, many
states, including Alabama, have yet to make the change to
funding with an emphasis on student performance. Most
states who adopted formulas similar to the foundation pro-
gram formula used in Alabama have failed to recognize that
the amount of money needed to educate students in one dis-
trict may not be the amount needed to educate other students
in a different district (Reschovsky & Imazeki, 2000).
Alabama, however, has invested in three programs designed
to improve student achievement in three critical areas. These
include the Alabama Reading Initiative (ARI), the Alabama
Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) and the
Alabama Connecting Classrooms Educators and Students
Statewide (ACCESS) in advanced secondary classes.
Now that states have set ambitious performance goals for
their students and the federal No Child Left Behind Act of
2001 has demanded that all children achieve those standards
in reading and mathematics by 2013-2014, the push is to link
education spending to academic results (Olson, 2005). While
Alabama has yet to define a true meaning of an "adequate"
education, it has chosen to direct specific allocations focused
on improving the academic results of students. In 1998, the
Pouncey et al. 5
state launched a study of 16 schools participating in the ARI
using US$1.5 million dollars from corporate donations to
fund the project. The initiative was targeted to strengthen
reading instruction in the early grades, continuously expand-
ing all students' reading power and comprehension, and
intervening effectively with struggling readers.
AMSTI provides three basic services to schools in an
effort to boost hands-on learning experiences in math and
science. Central to its success is a strong recurring profes-
sional development model that involves all teachers in
Grades K-8 with extensive professional development train-
ing. In addition, teachers are supported throughout the year
with prepackaged manipulative kits that allow each class to
engage in hands-on learning experiences.
TheACCESS represents a statewide initiative that focused
on bringing true equity in instructional opportunities to all
Alabama high school students. It provides a blended approach
of online and interactive learning experiences through a
statewide distance learning effort. When fully implemented,
all 440 Alabama high schools will be connected; each will
have the have the ability to offer students more rigorous and
advanced learning opportunities. This initiative began in
2006 with 24 pilot sites and an appropriation of US$10 mil-
lion dollars, and has been granted increased state funding
each year to its current level of US$25 million dollars for
FY2009 (Alabama Department of Education Legislative
Budget Request, FY 2008-2009).
These efforts have served to focus resources on improv-
ing student learning and have produced significant academic
gains statewide. The National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP), which was released in September 2007,
showed Alabama public schools made more improvement in
fourth-grade reading than any other state in the nation. The
NAEP report showed a significant gain of eight points in
fourth-grade reading for Alabama students--almost triple
the national average in gains. In 2005, the scaled score was
208, and in 2007 it increased to 216. Today, Alabama is only
four scale score points away from the national average (220)
in fourth-grade reading (The Nation's Report Card: NAEP,
http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard).
In addition, NAEP data show Alabama posted gains in
fourth-grade mathematics and in eighth-grade mathematics.
In 2005, fourth graders in Alabama scored 225 points, and in
2007 the score rose to 229. While the national average
improved by two points, Alabama's score showed a four-
point gain. The percentage of students who performed at or
above the NAEP proficiency level was 26% in 2007, up from
21% in 2005. Alabama's eighth graders improved NAEP
mathematics score from 262 in 2005 to 266 in 2007 (The
Nation's Report Card: NAEP, http://nces.ed.gov/nationsre-
portcard). These focused appropriations have begun to move
Alabama up in the nationally ranked means of measuring
student achievement.
This study looks at four constructs of educational funding
perspectives: (a) equity and adequacy, (b) personal values,
(c) political ideology, and (d) social influence. It is important
to understand how such perspectives are formed.
The Formation of Attitudes and Opinions
Behavioral studies in the field of politics have long recog-
nized the need for a thorough understanding of the fields of
psychology, sociology, and anthropology. These disciplines
often present an array of competing positions but their syn-
thesis offers a basis to more accurately examine attitude
research (George, 1958). Specifically, how does attitude
affect the general disposition of a superintendent or legislator
to take action in a certain way?
George (1958) stated that
the notion that political man is a purposive being, engaged in
instrumental behavior and exercising reason in attempting to
choose his course of action wisely is, of course, a traditional and
highly respected idea in political science. This notion, has long
served as the basis for interpreting and accounting for political
action by means of the so-called "rational hypothesis." (p. 21)
Karl Popper has chosen to interpret political action by
means of the rational hypothesis, the "logic-of-the-situation"
type of explanation (Popper, 1952). Those individuals choos-
ing to "act" are assumed to choose among alternative courses
of action based on their assessment of logic of the situation
that they are confronting. For example, if an inner city school
is labeled as a failing school, a legislator may perceive it is a
result of poor teaching and a lack of proper administration.
However, the school may have far more challenges than
other schools, in that there may be many more socioeco-
nomic barriers preventing the school from succeeding.
One study (George, 1958) claimed that "one takes account
of the actual and programmed use of these three functions--
`object appraisal,' `social adjustment,' and `externalization'"
(p. 21). All of these factors apply motivational forces in
forming opinions. Likewise, "reality testing," "reward and
punishment," and "ego defense" are three additional motiva-
tional contexts of attitudes (Saruoff & Katz, 1954).
Researchers have validated that no single factor forms opin-
ions or shapes attitudes.
Social Influences
The process of opinion change is greatly affected by social
influence. In a study on opinion change by Kelman (1961),
he identified processes of social influences that guide all
opinion changes: compliance, identification, and
internalization.
Compliance can be said to occur when an individual
accepts influence from another person or from a group
because he hopes to achieve favorable reaction from the
other. He may be interested in attaining certain specific
rewards or avoiding certain specific punishments that the
6 SAGE Open
influencing agent controls (Kelman, 1961). For example, he
stated that "some individuals may compulsively try to say
the expected thing in all situations and please everyone with
whom they come in contact out of a disproportionate need
for favorable responses from others" (Kelman, 1961, p. 62).
The individual learns to say or do the expected thing in spe-
cial situations, regardless of their private beliefs.
The second social influence that guides the development
of opinions is identification. Identification can be said to
occur when an individual adopts behavior derived from
another person or a group because this behavior is associated
with a satisfying, self-defining relationship with a given per-
son or group. It contributes to a person's self image. In
accepting influence through identification, an individual has
a way of establishing or maintaining the desired relationship
to the other party. Opinions formed through identification
may take all or part of the role of the influencing agent. He or
she defines their role in terms of the role of the other (Kelman,
1961). An example of this may include political party affilia-
tion or caucus membership. An individual's opinion is influ-
enced by a desire to maintain affiliation with the group and
often embraces the opinion of the group whole heartedly to
maintain acceptance.
The third social influence that affects opinion formation
of an individual is that of internalization. It is said to occur
when an individual accepts influence because the induced
behavior is congruent with his own value system. The indi-
vidual adopts it because he finds it useful for the solution of
a problem or because it is congenial to his own orientation or
that is demanded by his own values (Kelman, 1961).
Compliance, identification, and internalization are, in
effect, tools needed to influence or internalize change.
Core Beliefs and Values
An individual's core beliefs and values represent the basic
fiber of an individual as he or she enters the arena on the first
day of political interaction. To some extent, policies and
actions are often judged right or wrong because of their
implications for deeply held values (Rokeach, 1973). A set of
widely shared beliefs, values, and norms concerning the rela-
tionship of citizens to their government and to one another in
matters affecting public affairs is often recognized as politi-
cal culture (McCloskey & Zaller, 1984).
Three widely shared beliefs that tend to define the core
values of an individual are (a) a belief in equal opportunity,
(b) support for economic individualism, and (c) support for
the free enterprise system (Devine, 1972). All three of these
are major components of what Devine identified as the basis
of American public opinion and have been argued to be cen-
tral to the way in which people in the United States think
about politics.
Economic individualism, the belief which people should
get ahead because of their own hard work, is a core element
in accounts of American values and beliefs. Some of the
earliest European settlers brought with them a commitment
to the work ethic already entrenched in industrialized Britain
(Feagin, 1975). Evidence of a widespread belief in the work
ethic is still apparent in opinion surveys today.
The companion belief to work ethic is equality of oppor-
tunity. Despite obvious discrimination against minorities and
women, the United States was the first nation to acknowl-
edge that formal equality is a right of all people (Lipset,
1979). Americans have interpreted equality as formal or
political equality rather than equality of results. Its value was
meant to be interpreted in terms of advancement rather than
as an asset in itself.
The third belief that serves as a core value is that of the
strong support to the free enterprise system. The free enter-
prise system can be seen as the economic side of the indi-
vidualistic social system. Support for the free enterprise
system has typically been accompanied by a distrust of big
government (Lipset, 1979). The support for capitalism and
free enterprise forms one of the basic elements of the
American political culture.
Core beliefs are not uniformly distributed within the pub-
lic or in the ideals of politicians or superintendents. To the
extent that differences exist, these beliefs can account for
variations in policy preferences, political evaluations, and
candidate preference (Feldman, 1988). Take for example the
belief in equal opportunity for all. To one legislator that may
be interpreted as the need to propose policy language that has
very little restrictions on government interference, while
another legislator may interpret equal opportunity for all to
include nondiscriminatory language in any proposed
legislation.
Political Ideology
Being aware of the current "Political Ideology" is very
important. All legislators hold personal views, beliefs, and
values. They often move away from them to vote, according
to the views and beliefs of their constituents. Legislators may
bow to threats or enticements and vote against their own val-
ues, especially in highly publicized issues. In fact, research-
ers have raised doubts about the importance of personal
ideological orientations of an individual legislator when it
comes to roll-call voting (Clausen, 1973).
Transparency in voting produces strong incentives for
legislators to adhere to constituency preferences (and ignore
their own) on all but the most trivial or obscure bills. Voters
seem to evaluate incumbents largely on the basis of simple
name recognition, personal trustworthiness, and providing
legislative grants and service as ombudsmen in the bewilder-
ing bureaucracy. Few voters demand that representatives
unswervingly follow constituency in all their roll-call votes.
The result is that for a vast majority of the votes, "a congress-
man can do as he wishes" (Fenno, 1977, p. 911).
In most sessions, legislators confront a few highly publi-
cized, controversial issues; their private policy views may
Pouncey et al. 7
matter little. When confronted with issues similar to these, an
elected official may resort to ideology as a means to define
his or her position. The use of political ideology as a matter
of "position" on a given issue is defined as a set of general
attitudes about the proper role of government in the alloca-
tion of values in society; it contains a general evaluation of
the status quo of wealth and power, and a general orientation
toward the extent and nature of any changes that government
should pursue. This definition partakes of questions usually
associated with the "liberal/conservative or a Republican/
Democrat" continuum in politics (Entman, 1989).
Oftentimes, legislators choose to adopt the ideology of
the majority of their constituents on a particular issue as a
matter of pursuing the pathway of least resistance and as the
safest path that minimizes any criticism that they may receive
as a result of the position they take. Conservative legislators
most often represent more affluent suburbs and rural areas;
in contrast, liberal legislators tend to represent predomi-
nantly urban areas which stand to benefit from the programs
usually supported as a means of improving social factors that
benefit the masses (Entman, 1989).
Being cognizant of an individual's political ideology is
important when approaching legislative changes. One's
political ideology can also serve to assist in addressing mea-
sures that attempt to diminish public education's position. It
is this political ideology that many legislators wear as a pro-
tective shield, and it allows their actions to be viewed based
on a defined group and not that of an individual.
Gender Differences
Today, 32 out of 132 superintendents in Alabama are female,
and 18 legislators are female out of a total of 140 legislators
in the state. Women now have an established presence in an
arena traditionally dominated by men. Many believe that
women will focus their time and efforts on policy develop-
ment issues that are more important to women as a group,
which will change the way these issues are conceptualized,
debated and legislated to produce substantive policy out-
comes that serve women better than similar outcomes
designed by men (Thomas, 1994).
Numerous studies of women legislators find that they
focus on issues that follow from their status as women and
their socialization as part of this distinct group. Sanbonmatsu
(2002) found that female legislators have defined distinct
positions nationally as they relate to reproductive rights.
Tolbert and Steuernagel (2001) noted that female legislators
have shaped national policy on health care issues as they
relate to all women and children. Both studies validate that
the overarching allegiance to and support of the effects of
policy development occur with all women, in general, rather
than a party allegiance to Democrats or Republicans.
Other issues that women have successfully influenced
involve their traditional social roles as mothers and caregiv-
ers, such as, policies about child protection, or those related
to these traditional social roles, such as education and health
care (Thomas, 1994). Women try to change policies in these
areas primarily through agenda-setting activities in the legis-
lature, where they have the most leeway to be policy leaders
in their areas of interest (Tamerius, 1995). Women introduce,
sponsor, and cosponsor more legislation in these areas.
Women legislators may have similar policy priorities and
interests to each other and different policy priorities from
men, but the specific alternatives to solving these policy
problems may not be the same. Instead, the policy alterna-
tives women favor are often "filtered through their own dif-
ferences as a female" (Carroll, 2002).
Female legislators see themselves as representatives of
women (Mansbridge, 1999). Mansbridge (1999) identifies
this type of representation as "surrogate representation" in
that women are able to act on behalf of women as a constitu-
ency beyond district or political boundaries, particularly
because of the marginalized place of their social group in the
political past.
The biggest differences in men and women's political
opinions tends to focus on policy priorities, in that women
are more interested in policies dealing with families, chil-
dren, and women's rights as well as policies related to other
areas, such as education, health care, and welfare. They tend
to be more supportive of government activism and regula-
tion, more compassionate toward low-income and minority
groups, less supportive of the use of force and in some cases,
more socially conservative than men (Thomas, 1994).
Group Affiliation and Choice Shift
Understanding the attitudes and opinions of a specific gender
or an individual legislator is only part of the puzzle. One
must realize the influence of group dynamics and how they
are intertwined in fostering opinion change. Friedkin (1999)
stated that the study of choice shift and group polarization is
a prominent line of work for social psychologists. It exam-
ines the effect of group memberships on individual attitudes.
A choice shift is said to occur when, after a group's interac-
tion on an issue, the mean final opinion of group members
differs from the members'initial opinion. Group polarization
is said to occur when the choice shift is in the same direction
as the mean initial opinion (e.g., if on some issue, the initial
attitude of the average member is positive, then the subse-
quent attitude of the average member will be more
positive).
Choice shifts can arise simply from inequalities in the
relative influence of persons in a group interaction. A choice
shift is the product of a group's social structure in which cer-
tain members have more influence than others during the
opinion formation process (Berger, Fisek, Hamit, Robert, &
Zelditch, 1977).
An examination of these dynamics and the other factors
reviewed from the literature are key to understanding how an
individual is influenced by his or her affiliation with multiple
8 SAGE Open
groups. These groups include, but are not limited to, party
affiliation, caucus membership, regional and demographic
affiliation, and constituent obligations. Understanding group
dynamics provides a better theoretical understanding of
those groups in which social structures affect individual and
group outcomes.
The knowledge gained from this review informed the
construction of the data collection instrument used in this
study.
Data and Method
This study utilized an ex post facto research design to ana-
lyze perceptual differences between two groups (superinten-
dents and legislators). The dependent variables included
opinions relative to school funding in four categories: equity
and adequacy, personal values, political ideology, and social
influence. These constructs were evaluated within several
demographic independent variables: gender, ethnicity, edu-
cation level, population of representative districts, and aver-
age household income of the districts.
The participants consisted of two groups: 140 elected
members of the State of Alabama legislature (comprising
105 members of the House of Representatives and 35 mem-
bers of the Alabama State Senate) and 132 local school
superintendents (39 of whom served as elected superinten-
dents and 93 having been appointed by their respective
boards). All were included to maximize the sample size.
Because of the uniqueness of this study, the researcher
developed the data collection instrument--a self-adminis-
tered, Likert-type scale questionnaire, School Funding
Factors Survey (available upon request). Specific items tar-
geted perceptual beliefs relative to the four constructs: equity
and adequacy, personal values, political ideology, and social
influence. Five demographic variables were also assessed on
each participant: gender, ethnicity, education level, popula-
tion of representative districts, and average household
income of the districts represented by the two groups.
Cronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients
were computed on the survey and all subscales.
Content validity of the instrument was established through
a two-stage process. First, survey items were extracted from
the existing literature on the subject and a thorough review
was conducted by experts in the field of higher education.
Second, the instrument was reviewed for content validity by
a panel of experts consisting of three legislators, and three
superintendents. After receiving input from these experts,
final edits to the instrument were completed and it was
approved for use by the university Institutional Review
Board.
The survey instrument was sent to each legislator and
superintendent in the State of Alabama. The survey included
a cover letter that provided the participant with an overview
of the study; in addition to assuring anonymity, it contained
information about who to contact with questions regarding
their rights as participants. Each potential respondent was
contacted by fax to inform them that they would be receiving
a survey regarding state finance of education. A link to the
online survey was subsequently emailed to each superinten-
dent; a hard copy of the questionnaire was mailed to each
legislator (along with a stamped, self-addressed envelope).
The superintendent participants had the option to either link
directly to the survey, submit their responses online or down-
load a hard copy of the survey and fax or mail their responses.
The legislative participants had the option to complete the
hard copy and either mail or fax their responses to the
researcher. To maximize response rates, differences in data
collection procedures were implemented after consultation
with legislative and state education staff.
An array of descriptive statistics was computed on all
variables. The analyses comparing the legislator and super-
intendent perspectives on school funding issues along the
four constructs was conducted using two-tailed independent
groups Student's t tests. Comparison of the superintendent
and legislator groups on demographics variables was con-
ducted with a Pearson's chi-square test of independence. All
statistical analyses were conducted at the 0.05 level of sta-
tistical significance using the SPSS statistical software
package.
Results
Cronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients
for the School Funding Factors Survey and its subscales are
provided in Table 1. These reliability coefficients were
deemed acceptable for a user-designed instrument. Increasing
the number of items per subscale, however, may have
improved the reliability.
Before analysis, the data were examined for overall accu-
racy. This included checks for missing data elements, dupli-
cation of records, sufficient frequency counts in each level of
variable to support the chi-square test of independence (cat-
egories were collapsed where necessary), and deletion of
unusable records. Generally, records were eliminated from
the data for missing demographic data elements or duplica-
tion of the entire record. Furthermore, records were elimi-
nated from analysis if small counts could cause spurious
results in later analyses or potentially threaten the anonymity
of the respondent; for example, the single informant who
was self-reported as "Native American/Alaskan Indian."

Four subscale scores and a total score were generated from
the survey items. First, the subscale score for equity and ade-
quacy was formed by summing the first 15 items of the sur-
vey; this score could range from a low of 15 to a high of 75.
Second, the subscale score for personal values was formed
by summing items 16 through 20; this score could range
from a low of 5 to a high of 25. Third, the subscale score for
political ideology was formed by summing items 21 through
28; this score could range from a low of 8 to a high of 40.
Fourth, the subscale score for social influence was formed by
summing items 29 through 33; this score could range from a
low of 5 to a high of 25. Finally, an overall scale score for
funding factors was formed by summing all School Funding
Factors Survey items; this score could range from a low of
33 to a high of 165.
The basic demographic analysis is displayed in Table 2.
Among respondents approximately 40% were legislators,
and 60% were school superintendents.
Responses to highest education level were recoded into
five hierarchical levels. A majority of respondents, 77.5%,
fell into one of three categories with very nearly equal per-
centages. The largest percentage of respondents were at the
level of "post-master's (no doctorate)" at 26.5%, followed
closely by those responding at the level of "doctorate" with
27.2%, and those claiming "master's degree" following
closely at 23.8% of the sample. Recoding the variable dis-
trict population resulted in two categories with three times
more respondents identifying their district population as
"less than 50,000." The variable average income showed
45.0% of the respondents at the middle level of
"US$30,000-US$60,000."
The difference in subscale and total scale means between
legislators and superintendents are given in Table 3. In par-
ticular, the difference in means on the construct Equity and
Adequacy was found to be statistically significant (p < .05).
The data show a difference between legislators and superin-
tendents on the factor of equity and adequacy on the order of
0.4 standard deviation, a moderate effect (Cohen, 1988),
with legislators scoring, on average, 2.14 points higher than
superintendents on this scale. This score indicates greater
disagreement by the legislators than disagreement by the
superintendents.
All categorical variables were investigated for differences
on the demographic variables using the chi-square test of
independence. The results of these tests are found in Table 4.
Statistically significant differences (p < .05) between leg-
islators and superintendents were found on education level,
district population and average income with superintendents
exhibiting higher educational attainment, representing
smaller population bases, and bringing home smaller pay-
checks than legislators (see Table 2).
Further analysis involved comparing legislator and super-
intendent mean responses to each survey item using a stu-
dent's independent samples t test. Because 33 simultaneous

t tests were performed on the data, the Bonferroni correction
was applied. To control for experiment-wise Type I error, the
significance level required to ensure a true 0.05 level of sig-
nificance was 0.05/33 = 0.0015. On 12 of the items, mean
differences were found to be statistically significant (p <
.05). Eight of these items (6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15)
were used in generating the construct of equity and adequacy.
Those 8 items represented 53.3% of the subscale's score.
Two additional items (19 and 20) were subsumed into the
construct of personal values and contributed 40% of the sub-
scale score. One item (23) was included in the construct of
political ideology and contributed 12.5% of the subscale's
score. One final item (29) was a component in the construct
of social influences and represented 20% of the subscales
score. The means, standard deviations, differences between
group means, by item, are reported in Table 5.
Superintendents outscored legislators on items: 10, 12,
20, 23, and 29. Note that a larger scaled value indicates less
agreement with the survey item statement. The complete text
of the survey is available from the authors upon request.
Conclusion and Implications
The purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing
the thoughts and perceptions of statewide policy makers
engaged in the process of funding schools. Alabama has 140
legislators and 132 school superintendents. They collectively
represent a very diverse group of constituents as well as per-
sonal backgrounds and experiences. In addition, they vary in
their level of understanding of the political process and their
understanding of quality school programs. Superintendents
and legislators must gain a clearer understanding of each
other's thinking to develop effective strategies for establish-
ing a consensus for change. Identifying differences and simi-
larities between superintendents and legislators can provide
directives for future consensus initiatives relative to securing
and deploying additional resources. The outcomes of this
study should be useful to both groups as they gain an
enhanced understanding of each other's perspectives related
to school funding.
Evidence was found to conclude there is a difference
between legislators and superintendents on the factor of
equity and adequacy; furthermore, the typical legislator
scored 2.14 points higher than superintendents on this factor.
The mean factor scores on Equity and Adequacy are actually
weighted averages based on eight survey items. Of these
eight items, superintendents outscored legislators on only
two of the factor items. In addition, of these two factors only
one factor difference was statistically significant and the
other factor difference indicated an emerging trend toward
significance. The two survey items are number 10 and 12.
Survey item 10 states, "Districts should be required to
contribute a local match in an amount greater than 10 mills in
order to receive state funds." The median response for legis-
lators was agreement, but the median response for superin-
tendents was disagreement. Efforts could be made to inform
legislators that most states require a local match much higher
than 10 mills required in Alabama. This low threshold results
in a funding model that is primarily dependent on state
appropriations. An increase in local match would provide
more stable funding for the districts and take some of the
pressure off the legislators to meet the needs for providing
adequate state funds. This represents an opportunity to build
consensus and capitalize upon a win-win outcome for both
groups.
Survey item 12 states, "State implemented achievement
tests are the best in assessing the performance of a school
district." The median response among legislators was neutral-
ity, while the median response among superintendents was
disagreement. The difference between the two groups shows
that there is a predisposed tendency to view school success by
multiple factors, especially on the part of superintendents.

Some of these factors may include parental satisfaction,
extracurricular accomplishments, teamwork, behavior and
attendance, using subject measurement factors other than
norm-referenced tests, and a variety of other measures that
contribute to a person's success in life and contributions to
society. Superintendents' disagreement with achievement
tests as the best means of measuring success may be based on
their experience that all students cannot be fairly measured by
the same factors. Instead, multiple measures may be employed
to ensure schools are educating the total child regardless of
their background. A better understanding and agreement
between legislators and superintendents about what children
should learn to be successful, productive citizens is a cogent
starting point to begin the discussion.
Nationally, there exists a large gap between spending in
tax-wealthy and those poorer districts that are limited in tax
capacity. This disparity presents a problem in that educa-
tional funding is limited in poorer areas, thereby often con-
tributing to fewer resources and personnel for some students,
depending upon where they reside. As decisions regarding
the parity of spending are made at the state level, where leg-
islators and superintendents engage in discussion through
committees and other fact-gathering endeavors, the study of
perceptions is critical to the creation of final policies that
impact school funding issues. Although the current body of
research on school funding is abundant, there is a paucity of
research in the area of differences in perceptions of school
superintendents and legislators as it relates to school funding
policy decisions. Thus, this study seeks to make a contribu-
tion to the body of literature on the topic. Policy intermediar-
ies are individuals who work with sometimes disparate
groups to help them find points of agreement so that policies
can be developed to improve the "public good" or "public
welfare." The quality of those policies is directly influenced
by the information that legislators and superintendents
receive. The findings of this study clearly point out that it is
incumbent upon these intermediaries to locate, distill, and
share in understandable and succinct units of information
that are usable by the groups directly responsible for creating
and legislating educational funding policies. The practical
outcomes of this study that intermediaries may use to
improve policy development processes and products are that
they should:
·
· Identify key policy issues well in advance that are
well documented and data based;
·
· Keep key policy issues to a minimum, avoiding infor-
mation saturation;
·
· Frame policy issues clearly and succinctly without
using excessive educational or legislative jargon.
·
· Understand that both legislators and educators need a
shared definition of what constitutes "adequacy."
(The data suggest that viewpoints are disparate on this
definition; adequacy is associated with the responsi-
bility to ensure an education that is standards based.
Historically, education has been focused on an "equi-
table" education, that is, funding based on distribution
of funds rather than funding for achievement of stan-
dards. This is a new definition that is not understood
or shared by all factions of policy makers.)
·
· Supply research around key policy issues that is
timely, provides an historical context, and is
accurate.
·
· Provide all decision makers and their immediate sup-
port staff involved in the issue with the same high-
quality information.
·
· Note the make-up of the various committees charged
with creating and dispensing policies; identify gender,
ethnicity, educational levels, and constituent informa-
tion (socioeconomic levels, population densities).
·
· Recognize the historical influence in respective cham-
bers/districts (not part of study, but considered

important in retrospect). This is important because
these key leaders, whether legislative or educational,
hold influence over their counterparts, who tend to
support them and their viewpoints regardless of their
personal affiliations. Therefore, it would be worth-
while in the development of policy to test and/or pique
the interest of these key leaders when policy issues of
importance to educational funding are on the docket
for review and action.
