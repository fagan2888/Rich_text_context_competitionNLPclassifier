Context: Little is known about the relationship be-
tween race/ethnicity and depression among US blacks.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence, persistence, treat-
ment, and disability of depression in African Ameri-
cans, Caribbean blacks, and non-Hispanic whites in the
National Survey of American Life.
Design: A slightly modified adaptation of the World
Health Organization World Mental Health version of the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Setting: National household probability samples of non-
institutionalized African Americans, Caribbean blacks,
and non-Hispanic whites in the United States con-
ducted between February 2, 2001, and June 30, 2003.
Participants: A total of 3570 African Americans, 1621
Caribbean blacks, and 891 non-Hispanic whites aged 18
years and older (N=6082).
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime and 12-month
diagnoses of DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD),
12-month mental health services use, and MDD disabil-
ity as quantified using the Sheehan Disability Scale and
the World Health Organization's Disability Assessment
Schedule II.
Results: Lifetime MDD prevalence estimates were high-
est for whites (17.9%), followed by Caribbean blacks
(12.9%) and African Americans (10.4%); however, 12-
month MDD estimates across groups were similar. The
chronicity of MDD was higher for both black groups
(56.5% for African Americans and 56.0% for Caribbean
blacks) than for whites (38.6%). Fewer than half of the
African Americans (45.0%) and fewer than a quarter
(24.3%) of the Caribbean blacks who met the criteria re-
ceived any form of MDD therapy. In addition, relative
to whites, both black groups were more likely to rate their
MDD as severe or very severe and more disabling.
Conclusions: When MDD affects African Americans and
Caribbean blacks, it is usually untreated and is more se-
vere and disabling compared with that in non-Hispanic
whites. The burden of mental disorders, especially de-
pressive disorders, may be higher among US blacks than
in US whites.

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISOR-
der (MDD) is a com-
mon and disabling
psychiatric disorder in
the United States and
elsewhere.1-5 Worldwide, it is the fourth
leading cause of disability and the lead-
ing cause of nonfatal disease burden, ac-
counting for almost 12% of total years lived
with disability.6 In the United States, the
economic burden of depression was esti-
mated to be $83 billion in 2000.7
The relationship between race and
MDD is complex. Large epidemiologic sur-
veys1,8,9 find that compared with non-
Hispanic whites, blacks have lower life-
time rates of MDD and equivalent or lower
rates of 12-month MDD. At the same time,
blacks are overrepresented in high-need
populations, have reduced access to men-
tal health services, and often receive poorer
quality care than whites.10 The National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS) found that al-
though blacks had a lower lifetime risk of
mood disorder than whites, once diag-
nosed they were more likely to be persis-
tently ill.11

Approximately 6% of the black population is foreign born,
and 10% (3.4 million persons) is of foreign parentage.13
There are more black immigrants in the United States than
American Indians,14 Cuban Americans,15 Chinese, or Japa-
nese.16 Blacks from the Caribbean constitute the largest
subgroup of black immigrants.13,17
However, little is known about the mental health pro-
file of Caribbean blacks, and it is unclear how their risk
of MDD compares with that of African Americans. Carib-
bean immigrants have higher levels of income18,19 and
lower rates of adult20,21 and infant22 mortality than native-
born blacks, which might lead one to expect lower rates
of MDD. However, 2 studies23,24 of Caribbean blacks
found that they had higher levels of depressive symp-
toms than black Americans, whereas a recent study25
found that Caribbean-born poor black women had lower
rates of probable depression than US-born poor black
women. Results of studies of Caribbean immigrants in
the United Kingdom have also been inconclusive. In con-
trast to a consistent finding of elevated risk of schizo-
phrenia,26-28 studies have found comparable, higher, and
lower risk of depression or depressive symptoms for Ca-
ribbean blacks29-33 compared with the rest of the British
population.
One of the major limitations of previous research on
African American mental health has been the small sample
sizes that have precluded detailed analyses of how the
risk of MDD varies for ethnic subgroups of the black popu-
lation. This article presents results from the recently com-
pleted National Study of American Life (NSAL), the larg-
est study of mental health in the black population ever
conducted in the United States.34 The purpose of this study
is to systematically explore the prevalence and persis-
tence levels, sociodemographic correlates, impairment,
and treatment of MDD in African Americans, Caribbean
blacks, and non-Hispanic whites.

METHODS
SAMPLE
The NSAL is part of a National Institute of Mental Health Col-
laborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys initiative that in-
cluded 3 national surveys: the NSAL, the NCS Replication
(NCS-R), and the National Latino and Asian American Study.35
The NSAL adult sample was an integrated national household
probability sample of 3570 African Americans, 891 non-
Hispanic whites, and 1621 blacks of Caribbean descent (Ca-
ribbean blacks), for a total sample of 6082 individuals 18 years
and older.36 The African American sample, the core sample of
the NSAL, is a nationally representative sample of households
located in the 48 contiguous states with at least 1 black adult
18 years and older. The term African American is used to de-
scribe persons who self-identified as black but did not identify
ancestral ties to the Caribbean. Fifty respondents in the Afri-
can American sample were born in Africa. Caribbean blacks are
persons who self-identified as black and indicated that they were
of West Indian or Caribbean descent, that they were from a coun-
try included on a list of Caribbean countries presented by the
interviewers, or that their parents or grandparents were born
in a Caribbean country. The Caribbean black sample was se-
lected from the core sampling areas of the NSAL (n=265) and
from additional metropolitan segments (n=1356) that were
sampled based on the concentration of blacks of Caribbean de-
scent (10%). The non-Hispanic white sample was a stratified,
disproportionate sample of non-Hispanic white adults resid-
ing in households located in census tracts and blocks that have
a 10% or greater African American population. These whites
represent 14% of the white population in the United States. The
sample design and analysis weights for this sample were de-
signed to be optimal for comparative analyses in which resi-
dential, environmental, and socioeconomic characteristics are
controlled in the black-white statistical contrasts. For all 3 race/
ethnic samples, the NSAL weights were designed to correct for
disproportionate sampling, nonresponse, and population rep-
resentation across various sociodemographic characteristics.
Table 1 provides the weighted sociodemographic character-
istics of the sample.
Most interviews (86%) were completed face to face using a
computer-assisted instrument and lasted an average of 2 hours
and 20 minutes. The remaining interviews were either par-
tially or entirely conducted by telephone. All the interviews were
performed in English, but the Caribbean sample included per-
sons from English-, French-, Spanish-, and Dutch-speaking Ca-
ribbean countries. Data collection was completed between Feb-
ruary 2, 2001, and June 30, 2003. The final response rate was
72.3% overall: 70.7% for African Americans, 77.7% for Carib-
bean blacks, and 69.7% for non-Hispanic whites. Recruitment
and consent procedures were approved by the human sub-
jects committee of the University of Michigan.
A sample of 644 NSAL respondents completed a clinical re-
appraisal interview to evaluate 12-month diagnoses. The sample
was selected to ensure representation of respondents across each
of the racial/ethnic categories who had and had not met the di-
agnostic criteria for specific disorders. Whites, Caribbean blacks,
and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) cases
were oversampled. The data are weighted to adjust for over-
sampling so that the CIDI test characteristics estimates (sensi-
tivity, specificity, and total classification accuracy) are unbiased.
MEASURES
The World Mental Health CIDI, a fully structured diagnostic
interview, was used to evaluate a wide range of DSM-IV men-
tal disorders. The psychiatric disorders assessed in the NSAL,
which included MDD, are slightly modified versions of those
developed for the World Mental Health project initiated in 200037
and used in the NCS-R.38 The algorithm for MDD is the same
as that for major depressive episode (MDE): criteria C, the pres-
ence or absence of a manic episode, is not considered. The Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID),39 a diagnostic in-
terview that requires administration by a clinician, was used
in the reappraisal study to generate the diagnosis of MDE. A
comparison of the CIDI and the SCID for MDE for respon-
dents in the clinical reappraisal sample indicates fair concor-
dance for African Americans (=0.43; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.26 to 0.59) but much lower concordance for whites
(=0.27; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.67) and Caribbean blacks (=0.10;
95% CI, -0.19 to 0.39) (Table 2). For Caribbean blacks, the
12-month prevalence of MDE from the CIDI is markedly higher
than that from the SCID.
Multipleindicatorsofimpairmentwereused.Respondentswho
met the 12-month criteria for MDD were administered the Shee-
han Disability Scale40 and were asked to rate how much their de-
pressioninterferedwithfunctioninginhomemanagement,work,
relationships with others, and social life. The scale was divided
into 5 categories of severity: none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-
6), severe (7-9), and very severe (10). Days out of role was as-
sessed by a single item about the number of days in the past 365
days, when respondents with 12-month MDD were totally un-
able to carry out their daily activities because of their depression.
The World Health Organization's Disability Assessment
Schedule II (WHO-DAS-II) was an additional measure of im-

pairment.41 Respondents who said that their physical or men-
tal health was not excellent or whose health had changed for
the worse in the past year were administered a subset of items
from the WHO-DAS-II. The WHO-DAS-II is based on the In-
ternational Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health
and is cross-culturally applicable. It assesses functioning and
disability at the individual level instead of the disorder-
specific level. Thirty-day functional impairment in 7 WHO-
DAS-II domains was assessed: days out of role, self-care (wash-
ing, dressing, etc), mobility (standing, moving, etc), cognition
(concentration, memory, etc), social (conversing, maintain-
ing friendships, etc), productivity (quality and quantity of nor-
mal daily activities at home and at work), and family burden
(frequency with which respondents' health interfered with the
life and activities of their close friends and family). Respon-
dents who were not asked these questions owing to excellent
health were given a score of 0. For days out of role, the out-
come is the count of the number of days in the past 30 days
preceding the time of interview that respondents were unable
to carry out their normal activities. For the other domains, the
impairment measure is the number of days (in the past 30 days)
that the respondents' symptoms caused difficulty in the given
area of functioning weighted by the level of difficulty. Very se-
vere, severe, moderate, mild, and no difficulty were weighted
1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0, respectively.
Levels of depression-specific symptom severity were as-
sessed using a subset of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR),42 which measures symp-
tom severity during the worst 2-week period of the past year.
Six domains were assessed: sleep problems, depressed mood,
cognitive functioning (ie, concentration and decision mak-
ing), negative personal outlook, diminished interest, and an-
ergia. Respondent scores were summed across all domains and
were mapped onto the framework of the full Inventory of De-
pressive Symptomatology scale43 using conversion algorithms
developed for the QIDS-SR.44 The final converted score was di-
vided into 4 levels of depressive symptom severity: mild, mod-
erate, severe, and very severe.
African Americans and Caribbean blacks were asked if they
saw any of an extensive list of providers for problems with their
emotions, nerves, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs.
Health care treatment providers were categorized into mental
health specialty (psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and
social workers seen in mental health settings, other mental health
professionals, and mental health hotlines) and general medi-
cal (general practitioners, family physicians, nurses, occupa-
tional therapists, and other health professionals). Non­health
care providers were human services providers (religious and
spiritual advisors and counselors and social workers in non­
mental health settings) and complementary and alternative medi-
cine providers (herbalists, chiropractors, spiritualists, self-
help groups, and Internet support groups). Twelve-month
service use was defined as making at least 1 visit to a service
provider in the past 12 months.
In addition, respondents were asked whether they had taken
any medications in the past 12 months for problems with emo-
tions, nerves, mental health, substance use, energy, concentra-
tion, sleep, or ability to cope with stress. A medicine chest in-
ventory of respondents' medication bottles was conducted by
interviewerstomaximizeaccuraterecordingofmedicationnames
and dosages. Further questions asked about duration and source
(eg, psychiatrist or general practitioner) of treatment. Respon-
dents were also considered to have received treatment from the
health care sector if they reported taking antidepressant agents
for at least 30 days during the past 12 months, even if they had
not visited a health care provider during that time.
Sociodemographic correlates include race (African Ameri-
can, Caribbean black, or white), age, sex, employment status,
years of education completed, household income (divided ap-
proximately into quartiles), marital status, country of birth, re-
gion,45 and urbanicity (major metropolitan areas, suburbs with
a population 2500, and rural areas).46
ANALYSIS STRATEGY
Because the NSAL used a multistage sample design involving
clustering and stratification, specialized statistical techniques
to account for the complexity of the design and its associated
standard errors were used. In the NSAL the Caribbean black
sample is more clustered than the African American sample,
and the relatively small white sample represents a large popu-
lation of whites. Thus, the corrected standard errors for these
2 groups will usually be larger than those for the African Ameri-
can sample.
Cross-tabulations are given to show race and ethnic differ-
ences on prevalence of disorders and the severity of mental ill-
ness. The percentages represent weighted proportions based
on the sample's race-adjusted weight measure; the standard er-
rors reflect the recalculation of variance using the study's com-
plex design; and the Rao-Scott 2 represents a complex design­
corrected measure of association. Logistic regression analysis
was used to examine the demographic correlates of the preva-
lence of disorders. Odds ratio estimates and 95% CIs are given
along with design-corrected Wald 2 measures. Throughout the
analyses, P.05 on a 2-sided design-based test of significance

cance. All analyses were conducted using a software program
(SAS 9.12; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) that uses the Taylor
expansion approximation technique for calculating the com-
plex design­based estimates of variance.47
RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF MDD
The lifetime prevalence estimate of CIDI/DSM-IV MDD
is higher for whites (17.9%) than for African Americans
(10.4%) and Caribbean blacks (12.9%) (Table 3). The
levels of MDD for the 12 months before the interview were
more similar for the 3 groups, with prevalence esti-
mates of 5.9% for African Americans, 7.2% for Carib-
bean blacks, and 6.9% for whites. Whites (3.1%) have
slightly higher 30-day prevalence of MDD than African
Americans and Caribbean blacks (2.2% each). Regard-
ing the course and persistence of MDD, considering the
ratio of individuals with 12-month MDD in the sample
of lifetime MDD cases indicates that MDD is a chronic
disorder for most blacks. This measure of persistence is
higher for African Americans (56.5%) and Caribbean
blacks (56.0%) than for whites (38.6%). The 30-day to
12-month prevalence ratios indicate that MDD is inter-
mittent in its course, with whites having a higher ratio
(44.1%) than African Americans (38.2%) or Caribbean
blacks (31.2%). African Americans (21.6%), however,
have a higher 30-day to lifetime prevalence ratio than Ca-
ribbean blacks (17.5%) or whites (17.0%).
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
AfricanAmericansandwhites60yearsandolderhavelower
rates of lifetime MDD than their younger counterparts
(Table 4). A similar pattern is found for Caribbean blacks,
but it is not significant. African American females have al-
most twice the rate of MDD as their male peers, but, among
Caribbean blacks, women have a lifetime rate of MDD that
is comparable with that of men. Among African Ameri-
cans, employed persons have lower rates of MDD than the
unemployed, but this pattern is reversed for Caribbean
blacks. Education and income are unrelated to MDD risk
for all 3 race/ethnic groups. Across the 3 groups, married
persons tend to report lower rates of MDD than the un-
married, although this pattern is not significant for whites.
Caribbean immigrants have lower lifetime rates of MDD
than persons of Caribbean ancestry born in the United
States. There is a tendency, especially for African Ameri-
cans, toward regional variations in MDD, with residents
of the South and West having lower prevalence of MDD
than residents of the Northeast and Midwest. For African
Americans and whites, rural residence is associated with a
reduced rate of MDD. The elevated prevalence of MDD
linked tourbanicityis especiallymarked for AfricanAmeri-
cans and whites residing in major metropolitan areas.
Similar analyses (data not shown) were performed for
12-month disorders. The patterns were similar to those
for lifetime disorders. Two patterns for Caribbean blacks,
although not significant owing to low statistical power,
are worthy of note. The prevalence of 12-month MDD
was 8.5% for Caribbean men and 5.8% for Caribbean
women. Also, the 12-month rate of MDD was 10.9% for

US-born blacks of Caribbean ancestry but 2.0% for Ca-
ribbean immigrants.
ROLE IMPAIRMENT
Among respondents with 12-month MDD, 97.2% of Afri-
can Americans, 95.7% of Caribbean blacks, and 100.0%
of whites reported some role impairment related to their
depression in at least 1 of the 4 role domains (home, work,
relationships, and social) evaluated. In addition, 93.3%
of African Americans, 95.1% of Caribbean blacks, and
92.5% of whites rated their impairment to be at least mod-
erate in severity. Mean differences in impairment be-
tween African Americans and Caribbean blacks were not
significant. Accordingly, the 2 black groups were com-
bined and the impairment categories were collapsed into
none/mild/moderate and severe/very severe because of
the small number of cases in each impairment level. Three
of 4 blacks and almost 2 of 3 whites viewed their impair-
ment as severe or very severe in at least 1 domain
(Table 5). The level of impairment is greatest in the so-
cial role domain, and blacks report higher levels of this
impairment than whites; 55.4% of blacks and 34.2% of
whites indicated that social impairment is severe or very
severe. The lowest level of impairment is in the work do-
main, with 37.2% of blacks and 28.9% of whites describ-
ing this impairment as severe or very severe.
Respondents with 12-month MDD whose depres-
sion is rated as severe or very severe report more days
out of role in the past year (totally unable to work or carry
out their normal activities because of their depression),
and blacks report more days out of role than whites.
Among persons with severe or very severe impairment,
the average number of days out of role is 71 for blacks
and 63 for whites.
Levels of impairment on the 6 dimensions of the WHO-
DAS-II were also compared for persons with MDD with
those with no lifetime MDD. Preliminary analyses of func-
tional impairment for African Americans compared with
Caribbean blacks revealed only 1 significant difference,
with African Americans reporting higher levels of im-
pairmentinmobility.Accordingly,the2blackgroupswere
combined. Results of statistical tests (data not shown)
also indicated that the levels of functional impairment
for each domain were significantly different across the
4 MDD recency groups, with respondents with MDD re-
porting higher levels of impairment on all 6 of the WHO-
DAS-II domains compared with those with no history of
MDD. In general, blacks with MDD report higher levels
of functional impairment than whites (Table 6).
CLINICAL SEVERITY
The mean score on the QIDS-SR measure of severity was
significantly higher (P.05) for African Americans (15.6)
than for Caribbean blacks (13.8) but did not differ for
whites. In fact, 94.0% of African Americans, 95.4% of Ca-
ribbean blacks, and 96.2% of whites with 12-month CIDI-
defined MDD had their depressive symptoms indepen-
dently classified by the QIDS-SR as moderate, severe, or
very severe during their worst month of the year. The
mild and moderate severity categories were collapsed and
contrasted with the severe and very severe categories due
to the small number of cases. Although the mean sever-
ity scores for all of the correlates of symptom severity tend
to be higher for African Americans than Caribbean blacks,
they are not significantly different, probably owing to low
statistical power. Accordingly, the 2 black groups were
combined for the analyses in Table 7. Cases rated as mild
or moderate in severity do not differ from those rated se-
vere or very severe for the number of weeks depressed
in the past year, the level of comorbidity of MDD with
another disorder, and role impairment (the percentage
of respondents who were rated as severe or very severe
on at least 1 dimension of the Sheehan Disability Scale).
Cases of MDD rated as mild or moderate, however, had
fewer days out of role (7.6 days) than those rated as se-
vere or very severe (78.6) for whites. Two significant ra-
cial differences were also evident. Among MDD cases rated
on the QIDS-SR as mild or moderate, blacks reported more
days out of role and higher comorbidity than whites.

TREATMENT
Most participants with 12-month MDD received no treat-
ment (Table 8). Only 45.0% of African Americans and
24.3% of Caribbean blacks received treatment of any type.
For both black groups, except for treatment from non­
health care professionals for African Americans, the re-
ceipt of all treatment types did not significantly increase
as symptom severity increased. Only 48.5% of African
Americans and 21.9% of Caribbean blacks with severe
or very severe symptoms received any treatment. In the
NSAL, data on treatment were not collected for whites.
For each sector of treatment, African Americans with a
12-month MDD were more likely to receive treatment
than Caribbean blacks, but these differences were sig-
nificant only for non­health care, human services. Among
persons with 12-month MDD, 16.7% of African Ameri-
cans but only 2.8% of Caribbean blacks were receiving
treatment from the human services sector. Most visits to
human service providers for both groups were to the
clergy. Similarly, 20.4% of African Americans compared
with 3.6% of Caribbean blacks received services from non­
health care professionals. Among persons with a 12-
month MDD whose symptoms were rated as severe or
very severe, African Americans were more likely than Ca-
ribbean blacks to receive most types of treatment. For
those with mild or moderate severity, African Ameri-
cans were more likely to receive services from non­
health care, human services, and complementary and al-
ternative medicine providers.
COMMENT
These analyses reveal that the risk of MDD is similar for
African Americans and Caribbean blacks; however, com-
pared with whites in the NSAL, both black groups have
a lower lifetime prevalence but a higher risk of the per-
sistence of MDD. These findings come from the largest
psychiatric epidemiologic study of blacks in the United

States and the first to include a large national sample of
Caribbean-origin blacks. They provide a previously un-
available picture of mental health of the US black popu-
lation. Whites in the NSAL are not representative of whites
nationally, but the prevalence of MDD for whites is al-
most identical to that of whites in the NCS-R.9,48 More-
over, the elevated rates and lower persistence of MDD
for whites in the NSAL compared with blacks is consis-
tent with the NCS2,8 and the NCS-R9,48 and highlight the
need for renewed attention to identifying the factors re-
sponsible for the lower prevalence of MDD for blacks.
Future research should explore the extent to which so-
cial support systems, including religious participation and
psychological resources, such as high levels of self-
esteem, can provide some protection to the black popu-
lation from exposure to adverse social conditions.49
There were marked differences in concordance in the
clinical reappraisal analyses for African Americans
(=0.43) vs Caribbean blacks (=0.10). The  value for
African Americans was comparable with that obtained
in the NCS-R (=0.40).9 We do not understand why the
Caribbean sample had a much higher MDE prevalence
using the CIDI than the SCID. Additional analyses re-
vealed that the  value for Caribbean immigrants was
higher than that of US-born blacks of Caribbean ances-
try, suggesting that differences in acculturation is an un-
likely explanation. Furthermore, the  value for blacks
from the Spanish- and French-speaking Caribbean was
slightly higher than the  value for those from the English-
speaking Caribbean, suggesting that primary language dif-
ferences did not drive these patterns. It is possible that
the differences reflect the context of the interviews. The
CIDI was administered in an in-person interview in which
Caribbean respondents were typically matched to Ca-
ribbean interviewers. The SCID was a telephone inter-
view with no ethnic matching. It is possible that a tele-
phone interview, without ethnic matching, shortly after
the initial CIDI, may have raised suspicions that led to
underreporting. Some evidence suggests that ethnic mi-
norities are more likely to underreport sensitive infor-
mation in a telephone interview than in an in-person one.50
Alternatively, despite many efforts to make the CIDI and
SCID cross-culturally relevant and extensive use of these
instruments internationally,2 1 or both of these instru-
ments may not be appropriately calibrated for Carib-
bean blacks. There is an ongoing need to identify the op-
timal methods for assessing depression across ethnic
groups.
The present findings also shed light on the burden of
MDD for blacks. We found that both black populations
with MDD were overrepresented among persons with very
severe impairment, with African Americans having higher
levels than Caribbean blacks on some indicators of im-
pairment. Blacks with severe impairment, irrespective of
ethnicity, reported substantially more days out of role than
the national average for persons with MDD.9 These data
suggest that when blacks develop MDD, it is likely de-
bilitating in impact and persistent in its course. It is im-
portant to find out why blacks who develop this illness
have a poorer prognosis than their white counterparts.
These findings also emphasize the need for the treat-
ment of blacks with MDD. In the United States, 57% of
adults with MDD receive treatment,9 but we found that
most blacks with MDD, irrespective of ethnicity, do not
receive treatment. Only 48% of African Americans and
22% of Caribbean blacks with severe symptoms re-
ceived treatment. It has not been previously recognized
that Caribbean blacks, a group with higher income and
education than African Americans, have such marked lev-
els of underutilization of mental health services. Other
evidence indicates that blacks who do access mental health
care services receive poorer quality care than whites.51
These findings underscore the pressing need to under-
stand the factors underlying racial differences in access
and quality of mental health care and the urgency of imple-
menting interventions to eliminate these disparities.
There were sociodemographic factors that predicted
variations in MDD that point to potential differences in
the social context between Caribbean blacks and Afri-
can Americans. First, consistent with previous research
on other immigrant groups,52 Caribbean immigrants had
lower rates of MDD than US-born individuals of Carib-
bean ancestry. Future research needs to understand the
contribution of selection factors, acculturation pro-
cesses, cultural values, and social networks to the men-
tal health of black immigrants.52 Second, although it is
almost universally found that women have higher rates
of MDD than men,9,48,53,54 among Caribbean blacks, there

is no sex difference in lifetime and 12-month risk of dis-
order, with a nonsignificant trend for men to higher risk
of 12-month MDD than women. It is not clear whether
this pattern reflects the selective sex composition of the
immigrant pool or processes of advantage and disadvan-
tage linked to mental health risk and sex for Caribbean
immigrants. Research19,55,56 suggests that the new em-
ployment and educational opportunities that migration
to the United States provides for Caribbean women en-
hance their personal and financial autonomy and pro-
vide increased power in the family. These new freedoms
for women could be stressful for Caribbean men who were
socialized in a culture that is more patriarchal than in
the United States.57
There are several limitations to the analyses reported
herein. First, the data are cross-sectional, and it is not
possible to identify causal associations among the fac-
tors examined. Second, we cannot distinguish the asso-
ciation of factors related to the onset of MDD from those
related to its course. Third, the assessment of depres-
sive symptoms was based on self-report. We do not know
the extent to which cultural factors could affect the will-
ingness of respondents to either admit or recall the pres-
ence of symptoms during their lifetime or whether the
more generic problem of impaired memory recall could
affect subgroups of the sample differentially. Finally, the
sample of Caribbean blacks includes immigrants who vary
in time in the United States and US-born persons with
varying strength of ties to Caribbean culture. Future re-
search on this sample and, with larger samples of per-
sons of Caribbean ancestry, needs to examine the ways
in which the distribution of MDD varies by nativity sta-
tus, length of stay in the United States, and ancestry and
generational status. Nonetheless, the findings of this study
highlight the importance of identifying high-risk sub-
groups in racial populations and the continuing need to
target cost-effective interventions to them.
