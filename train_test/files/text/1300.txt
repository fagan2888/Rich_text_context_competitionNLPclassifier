Research Summary
The criminal use of firearms presents a unique challenge to policymakers and is the subject
of scientific study in fields such as criminology, public health, sociology, and law. Previous
research has described firearm use by terrorists in the United States as uniformly common;
however, little systematic attention has been focused on this phenomenon. Although valuable,
progress in this area has been hampered by the absence of reliable quantitative information.
Using data from the AmericanTerrorism Study and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, we
examine the firearm-offending characteristics of 923 federal felons and 336 terrorists.
Policy Implications
Findings indicate that many systematic differences exist between terrorists and other types of
federal felons and that terrorists are more likely than other felons to be convicted of firearm-
related crimes. We recommend that official efforts to monitor weapons sales--such as the
Brady Act--continue to include those named on the terrorist watch list and that those
named on the list be subject to additional law-enforcement scrutiny when attempting to
purchase firearms.These efforts should be coordinated by federal law-enforcement agencies
to facilitate the effective use of existing antiterrorism mechanisms in both blocking purchases
and garnering intelligence on terrorists attempting to obtain firearms.

Criminology & Public Policy
532
In recent years, terrorism has generated fear, mistrust, and procedural changes in the U.S.
criminal justice system.1 Many of these changes have led to policy debates that are neither
informed by empirical evidence nor based on well-founded and tested assumptions. A
promising criminological approach for examining terrorism is the situational crime-prevention
perspective.The examination of terrorists' behavior from this point of view allows criminologists
to offer policymakers relevant and timely empirical observations that could identify crimes and
other routine activities upon which law-enforcement efforts could be focused. The ultimate
objective of such policies is preventing potential terrorists from carrying out attacks. Additionally,
although scholars have pointed out several criminal activities in which terrorists are known to
participate, there have been few quantitative analyses detailing similarities and differences that
may exist between terrorists and other types of felons at an individual level. In short, there is a
demand for research that informs theory and substantive understanding of the types of crimes
committed by terrorists and possible prevention mechanisms.
One of the recent policy debates regarding the terrorism-crime nexus is focused on firearms.
For example, news reports have recently raised alarm that terrorist suspects may obtain firearms
legally (Lichtblau, 2005) and have publicized government efforts to integrate firearm purchase
regulations with antiterrorism efforts (Luo, 2007) through existing firearms background checks
(Krouse, 2005). At least one bill being considered by Congress aims to ban firearm purchases
by those who may be linked to terrorist activities.2 This is particularly important because little is
known about the characteristics of individual terrorists and how these characteristics may affect
access to firearms. For instance, some have speculated that terrorists may lack a pronounced
criminal history (e.g., Sageman, 2006) and that this would expose them to less law-enforcement
scrutiny when entering the United States (Meissner, 2004). If true, then a lack of significant
criminal history upon entry to the United States would increase terrorists' access to firearms
while in the United States.
Criminological research methodologies, findings, and associated policy recommendations
can provide a practical template with which some terrorists' activities may be studied (Hamm
and Van de Voorde, 2005; LaFree and Dugan, 2004; LaFree and Hendrickson, 2008).3 For
1.Terrorism in this study is defined as participation in alleged criminal activities that warrant counterterror-
ism investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and lead to federal indictment. For introduc-
tions to the vigorous debate regarding a functional definition of what types of behavior do and do not
constitute terrorism, see Hoffman (2006) and Schmid and Jongman (1988).
2.Senate Bill 1237--the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007--is currently
under consideration and was drawn from a Department of Justice recommendation to provide the At-
torney General with the discretion to deny firearm transfers to those who may intend to use the firearms
for terrorist purposes as well as revoke federal firearm licenses. This includes a provision for the Attorney
General to keep secret the reasons for denial or revocation if she or he considers those reasons to be
important to national security (U.S. Congress, 2007; U.S. Department of Justice, 2007).
3. We do not imply that terrorists are essentially criminals, nor do we imply that they are not. This debate
is beyond the scope of this article. We simply wish to note that criminological research, and the more
general literature on deviance, is useful to shed light on activities that are defined as terrorism.

instance, the use of firearms by American "street" criminals has been well documented and
a similar examination of firearm involvement among terrorists may explain their patterns
of use, common methods of obtaining firearms, motivations for use, preference for types of
firearms, and the instrumentality of firearms in causing harm. For instance, the finding that
many firearms used by criminals were originally stolen from legal gun owners has led to some
local laws requiring secure storage of privately owned guns as well as requirements to report
stolen guns to the police (c.f. Wintemute, 1999). Additionally, controlled market access and
supply-side restrictions, such as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, are
designed to reduce access by former felons and other restricted classes at the point of retail sale,
thus intending to reduce criminal firearm violence at U.S. state and federal levels (Cook and
Braga, 2001; Cook, Ludwig, Venkatesh, and Braga, 2007; Cook, Molliconi, and Cole, 1995).
A similar understanding of terrorist participation in firearm crime may yield similar, policy-
relevant recommendations.
Aside from public debate and the potential to improve fundamental scientific understanding
of terrorism, there is at least one compelling reason for addressing the terrorism-firearm dynamic:
Most research on terrorism has focused on terrorist groups or incidents, not on individuals who
have participated in terrorism; therefore, little research has examined terrorist weapon choice or
any individual-level characteristic of terrorists. Answers to many substantive questions are often
speculative at best. For this reason, we compiled individual-level data on terrorists that can be
directly compared with individuals who are not terrorists--namely, federal felons--offering a
new perspective and filling an important gap in this area of research.
Literature Review
Policy-relevant research on counterterrorism using advanced statistical methods is insufficient in
the social science literature. For example, in a recent Campbell Collaboration systematic review,
Lum, Kennedy, and Sherley (2006) examined 6,041 peer-reviewed publications and found
only 7 that used statistical tests sufficiently robust for effective evaluation of counterterrorism
policies. Furthermore, although a great deal is known about criminals who use firearms, little
empirically based knowledge is available regarding terrorism and crime or terrorist use of firearms
in the United States. To address some of these shortcomings, it is useful to discuss the studies
that have used quantitative methodologies to explore the intersection of crime and terrorism,
as well as past research that has informed our understanding of firearm crime.
Terrorism and Crime
Most recently, Dugan, LaFree, and Piquero (2005) used data from the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration and the RAND Corporation to examine 828 airline hijackings that occurred before
1986.They found that an increase in the perceived costs of hijacking as a result of metal detectors
and increased law enforcement at passenger checkpoints was effective in reducing nonterrorist
hijacking but that terrorist hijackings were largely unaffected, which led to the conclusion that
Weapon Choice and American Political Violence
Criminology & Public Policy
534
the rational choice perspective might be in need of continued refinement and that the level of
motivation, goals, and perception of risk differs between terrorist and nonterrorist hijackers.
The work of Dugan and colleagues echoes previous research examining the effects of policy
interventions on terrorism such as airport security increases, international conventions, and
national counterterrorism policies addressing international terrorist activities, which was recently
summarized by Enders and Sandler (2006). Enders and Sandler used a number of economic
techniques, including intervention analyses (i.e., Box-Jenkins models) and game theoretical
models, to examine terrorism from a traditional rational choice perspective.
Although quantitative methods have not been applied to data about individuals who par-
ticipate in terrorist activities, qualitative criminological work addressing individual characteristics
of terrorists is available. Working primarily from court transcripts supplemented with personal
interviews, Hamm (2005, 2007) outlined the process of terrorist group formation, commission
of attacks, and group dissolution and the role of individuals in these processes using routine
activities and social learning perspectives. Hamm (2005) argued that the daily lives of terrorists,
including their day-to-day interactions, create opportunities to commit attacks to occur and
expose terrorists to law enforcement. Likewise, crimes supporting terrorist group goals are made
possible by terrorist organizations exploiting the everyday routine activities of their victims.
Thus, Hamm (2005) argued that patterns of firearm use by terrorists can be understood by
using the routine activities framework. Indeed, Hamm explained the ultra-right-wing Aryan
Republican Army's success in bank robberies largely by invoking Cohen's notion of "capable
guardians" such as bank security measures or police surveillance, and also that the ability of
the ARA to engage in bank robbery was greatly facilitated by their use of all types of firearms
(Hamm, 2002, 2007).4 In his description of the Aryan Republican Army's (ARA) activities,
Hamm recounted the following behaviors leading up to a bank robbery:
Much like al-Qaeda in the East Africa Embassy attacks and late in the 9/11 plot,
the ARA devoted considerable attention to reconnaissance. Langan and Guthrie
would spend weeks casing banks, taking into account every moment in the taken-
for-granted order of daily life around their targets. They would fully occupy these
urban spaces by entering the banks in disguise, walking the streets and sidewalks,
entering area stores and eateries, and then driving escape routes over and over again.
These spaces were then videotaped and then studied for the small often unnoticed
practices of routine security.... Langan called off more than a dozen robberies due
to things such as changes in bank security, shifting police patrol patterns and the
unexpected presence of construction crews near the banks (Hamm, 2007: 176).
Hamm also wrote that firearms were intrinsic to the actual act of bank robbery: "At nine-thirty
A.M. March 29, Stedeford pulled the LeSabre into the bank's parking lot. Pete carried aTaurus

social learning component to terrorist behavior.

9-millimeter pistol, Guthrie had an Astra .45-caliber handgun. Kevin packed his .45 caliber
Glock and Scott toted an HK-91 assault rifle inside his guitar case. Langan, Guthrie, and Mc-
Carthy got out, dressed as construction workers with bulletproof vests and camouflage masks....

Felons and Firearms
An understanding of the character and nature of criminals who use firearms is usually derived
from surveys of incarcerated felons who used firearms in the past or are serving a sentence for
firearm crimes as part of their most recent conviction; usually, but not always, these surveys
focus on state prisoners (Scalia, 2000; Wright and Rossi, 1994). An additional data source is
self-report surveys from arrestees and delinquents (Bjerregaard and Lizotte, 1995; Decker, Pen-
nell, and Caldwell, 1997; Lizotte and Sheppard, 2001). These studies reveal patterns of illegal
gun use and details about where criminals obtain guns, criminals' preferences for certain types
of firearms, reasons for carrying or using firearms, and in some cases, demographic details and
criminal history.
Criminals tend to obtain firearms through illegal means. For instance, most state and federal
inmates report that they either obtained their last gun through illegal sources (33% and 39.2%,
respectively) or "borrowed" it from a friend or family member (39.6% and 35.4%, respectively)
(Scalia, 2000; Wolf Harlow, 2001). A minority of criminals purchase firearms: Approximately
22% of federal inmates bought their firearms at retail outlets, pawnshops, flea markets, and gun
shows, and approximately 14% of state inmates purchased their guns legally.
The types of firearms that tend to be reported by both state and federal inmates are similar.
Of those who report carrying a gun during their most recent offense, 83% of state inmates and
87% of federal inmates reported carrying a handgun (Wolf Harlow, 2001).This finding agrees
with similar studies and demonstrates that most criminals prefer small, easily concealed weapons
for criminal activities.5 It is important to note, however, that firearm possession charges are much
more common in federal courts than use charges, and more than 70% of the illegal firearm pos-
session charges between 1992 and 1998 included no other substantive charge (Scalia, 2000).
Federal and state firearm offenders differ somewhat in their criminal histories and other
personal characteristics. For instance, approximately 22% of state firearms offenders in 1997
had no previous known criminal sentences compared with only 9.5% of federal prisoners (Wolf
Harlow, 2001). State and federal firearm offenders also differ slightly by race. About 18% of
both black and white inmates in federal facilities used firearms (Wolf Harlow, 2001). In state
prisons, however, where firearm crimes are more common, firearm criminals tend to be nonwhite
(Wolf Harlow, 2001; Wright and Rossi, 1994).
5.Significantly fewer inmates reported carrying more lethal types of firearms, such as rifles (7% state and 9%
federal) and shotguns (13% state and 14% federal).
Weapon Choice and American Political Violence
Criminology & Public Policy
536
Among criminals who carry firearms, the most often self-reported reason for doing so is
self-protection (Bjerregaard andLizotte, 1995; Decker et al., 1997,Lizotte and Sheppard, 2001;
Wolf Harlow, 2001;Wright and Rossi, 1994).When inmates who used a gun in the commission
of a crime were asked for information on the extent of their firearm use, they often reported
that they brandished the weapon to "scare someone" or to "get away" (Wolf Harlow, 2001:
11). These findings indicate that a complex set of relationships motivates firearm offending
and that theoretical explanations for firearm use have important implications for enforcement
policy (Hamm, 2007).
Terrorists, Criminals, and Situational Crime Prevention
The routine activities perspective provides a framework with which to make sense of the situations
in which crimes occur during activities involved in everyday life (Felson, 1994). In this case,
terrorism is the crime of interest. Implicit in the routine activities perspective is the means to
develop policies, strategies, and tactics that take advantage of these common habits of criminals
to develop plans for situational crime prevention (Felson, 1994).
Clarke and Newman (2006) used this perspective to develop a situational terrorism pre-
vention model that relies on weapon choice as one of the four pillars of terrorist opportunity.6
They identified expected attributes of weapons that terrorists would prefer: "multipurpose,
undetectable, removable, destructive, enjoyable, reliable, obtainable, uncomplicated, and safe"
(2006: 108). Guns possess each of these attributes. Also--although they may lack some of the
shock value of explosives--their availability, lethality, relative safety, and ease of use seem to have
historically made guns popular among terrorists.7 For instance, according to data available in
the Global Terrorism Database version 1.1, approximately 41% of terrorist incidents between
1970 and 1997 in which weapon type could be determined were perpetrated with firearms
(authors' calculation of GTD1.1 data; LaFree and Dugan, 2008).
Accounts of terrorist activity suggest that terrorists differ from other types of criminals in
several key respects. First, a core, perhaps defining, activity of terrorism is the commission of
violent purposive criminal acts of a political nature (Schmid and Jongman, 1988). In contrast,
criminal acts are widely recognized to be committed in a haphazard fashion generally lacking
in foresight (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990). Second, patterns of terrorist offending seem
different from those of "street" criminals.Terrorists engage in acts of terrorism, such as kidnap-
ping, assassinations, mass attacks, and so on, as well as a variety of organizational maintenance
crimes, such as identity fraud, bank robbery, and racketeering (Hamm, 2007). In contrast,
felons tend to be less involved in rare crimes like assassination, kidnapping, and mass murder,
and they tend to be less involved in group offending--at least during later stages of the life
6.The four pillars of terrorist opportunity are targets, weapons, tools, and facilitating conditions (Clarke and
Newman, 2006: 9).
7. Although bombs are certain to make U.S. headlines, mass shootings--such as those that have occurred in
high schools and universities in the United States--have garnered immense public attention and reaction.

course (Piquero, Farrington, and Blumstein, 2007). Thus, one might hypothesize that terror-
ists have qualitatively different motivations as well as engage in different patterns of behavior
than other types of felons.
These differences seem to influence patterns of firearm offending. As distinct from terrorists,
criminals are likely to recognize firearms as a secondary tool that allows for easier commission
of crime, escape to be possible, and victim compliance to be greater, which reduces the chance
that victims will be hurt (Wright and Rossi, 1994: 128). In such cases, criminals who want to
commit a crime with a firearm but are unable to obtain one often report that they would forgo
the gun and still perpetrate the original criminal act (Wright and Rossi, 1994).8
In contrast, terrorist crime seems more strongly linked to firearm involvement.The research
in this area is primarily anecdotal, but it is voluminous, so we illustrate just a few examples.
Post, Sprinzak, and Denny (2003) outlined the role of motivations and values in 35 interviews
with incarcerated Middle Eastern terrorists. They noted that psychological constructions of
value and meaning were intimately associated with armed attacks that were often carried out
using commonly available Kalashnikovs and pistols. The results of their interviews generally
indicated that terrorists were in favor of armed attacks on Israel and endorsed the use of firearms
against their perceived oppressors. More importantly, strikes--with and without firearms--
provided a sense of empowerment, mastery, and fulfillment that was otherwise lacking in the
daily lives of Post and colleagues' research subjects. Regarding offense patterns, Hamm (2007)
wrote that firearms played a prominent role in bank, armored car, and interpersonal robberies
committed by white supremacist terrorists in the 1980s and 1990s and were an integral part
of planning acts of violence against the federal government in several instances (Hamm, 2002,
2005). Research on Irish political assassinations indicates that nearly 81% of political murders
were committed with a firearm as opposed to only 24% of nonpolitical murders (Lyons and
Harbinson, 1986). In short, some anecdotal evidence suggests that terrorists may be more likely
than other types of criminals to be involved with firearm offending because of motivational
differences and patterns of offending.
The Importance of Access to Firearm Markets
Firearms are a prominent part of U.S. trade. Estimates indicate that between 190 and 290
million firearms are privately owned in the United States, with four to six million being added
every year (Legault, 2008). Generally speaking, firearms are not easily homemade and must be
obtained from manufacturers through primary or secondary markets (Cook et al., 1995).
Access to firearms is an important issue for theory and policy.Aside from the aforementioned
motivational and behavioral differences between terrorists and other felons, there is a possibility
8. When asked what they would do if they could not obtain a handgun to commit a crime, 37% of state
inmates reported that they would go unarmed, 24% stated that they would carry a knife or club, and 40%
said that they would carry a long gun that had been sawed off to make it concealable (Wright and Rossi,
1994: 217).

that firearms are more available to terrorists because they might have overall greater access to
U.S. firearm markets. Firearms may be obtained in primary legal, secondary legal, and second-
ary illegal firearm markets (Cook et al., 1995). Primary markets are federally licensed firearm
dealers that are usually retail points of sale. The noteworthy difference between primary and
other markets is that primary markets require a firearms purchaser to produce identification, to
require the seller to record the details of the sale for review by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE), and to require a background check through the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before the firearm can be transferred to
the purchaser (Gun Control Act of 1968, 2006). These markets require actions that result in
the purchaser being exposed to federal law-enforcement authorities at some point in the sale.
Secondary firearm markets have no such requirements regardless of the type of transaction, and
they include both legal sales by private parties and sales or trade through illegal sources (Cook et
al., 1995). Obtaining firearms through illegal sources may expose terrorists to law-enforcement
scrutiny. If terrorists have less serious criminal histories than other felons, as some have speculated
(Meissner, 2004; Sageman, 2006), then terrorists would have a greater opportunity to obtain
firearms legally through primary markets and have greater access to secondary markets.
Conceptual Model
The literature suggests that two paths might influence terrorists' use of firearms. First, the situ-
ational crime-prevention perspective would predict that, ceteris paribus, a restriction on the
ability of terrorists to access primary and secondary markets would reduce firearm offending by
denying access to weapons. Second, previous literature indicates that terrorists are motivated to
obtain firearms and to engage differentially in crimes that involve guns. Our conceptual model
appears below. The model assumes several control variables that are discussed later.
Because so little is known regarding individual-level terrorist behavior, we must first test
some speculative assumptions on which these arguments lie and then test the more complex
relationships.Therefore, we hypothesized four relationships. First, we hypothesized that terror-
ists have a less extensive formal criminal history than nonterrorist felons. Second, we expected
that, because of motivational and behavioral differences, terrorists will participate in a variety
of firearm crimes.Third, we hypothesized that participating in terrorism will have a particularly
strong effect on charges for use and possession. Finally, based on the situational crime-prevention
perspective advocated by Felson (1994) and by Clarke and Newman (2006), we hypothesized
that criminal history mediates the relationship between terrorism and firearm crime through
differential access to firearms markets.

Data
This analysis is a comparative examination of 1,259 male felons prosecuted in the federal court
system between 1987 and 2002. These data are derived from two sources. The first source, the
American Terrorism Study (ATS), is a database detailing the characteristics of people charged
as a result of terrorism investigations by the FBI (Smith and Damphousse, 2006, 2007). In
this study, terrorism is defined by inclusion in this data set and does not necessarily equate to
involvement in an act of terrorism. The offender could have been charged with any number of
offenses resulting from his involvement in terrorist activities--just as other felons could have
been charged with any number of crimes resulting from similar actions that did not involve
terrorist activities.Therefore, it is involvement in terrorist activities as determined by a resulting
investigation by the FBI that defines terrorism in this study. The second data source used in
this study is the official records of male felons from the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC)
data. We discuss each data source in turn.
American Terrorism Study
The ATS is a study of the characteristics, behavior patterns, and tactics of U.S. terrorist groups
using abstracted courtroom records (although we use the individual-level offender files from
these data).The ATS was compiled by Smith and Damphousse (2002) in conjunction with the
FBI's Terrorist Research and Analytic Center and the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime.The data are derived from publicly available indictments of individuals
who have been identified and investigated by the FBI for potential involvement in terrorism-
related offending between 1978 and 2002. Initially in the form of court records, the relevant
variables were abstracted into a machine-readable format by Smith and Damphousse (2002) and
were made available to the research community.The ATS microdata include variables measuring
individual demographic status, membership in a terrorist group, the content and breadth of
formal legal charges and case disposition, and the outcome and location of prosecution. A wide
variety of crimes is represented in the ATS including conspiracy, weapons offending, fraud, and
others. For the purposes of this analysis, individuals in the ATS are considered "terrorists" and
are hereafter referred to using this term.

U.S. Sentencing Commission
The USSC data are collected under the auspices of the USSC and are used to monitor com-
pliance with federal sentencing guidelines (USSC, 1987­2002). The USSC data contain
official information on individuals processed in the federal court system under the 1984 U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines. These individual-level data measure offender characteristics such as
demographic status, crime of conviction, criminal history score, and amount of harm caused.
The USSC nonterrorist felons were selected randomly from a concatenated file created by the
authors containing all 631,869 individuals sentenced in the federal court system between 1987
and 2002 (U.S. Sentencing Commission, 1987­2002). Similar to the ATS, the USSC data
contain offenders charged with a wide variety of federal crimes. Individuals from the USSC file
are referred to in this analysis as "felons" or "nonterrorist felons." The USSC file is included to
provide a group of individuals to compare against terrorists from the ATS data.
Analytic File
Because the analyses were intended to make a direct comparison between ATS terrorists and
USSC felons, only years where data were available in both data sets were included and the data
were limited to felons only: All 374 felony cases from the ATS individual-level file from 1987
to 2002 were included in the data and a random selection of 1,125 felony cases was drawn
from the 1987­2002 USSC data.9 To create the analysis file, the ATS and USSC cases were
combined and variable coding was standardized across both data sets.
To obtain a focused comparison, we applied several restrictions to both the ATS and the
USSC data. Namely, we limited the data to male terrorists charged in the United States and
convicted of a felony during years common to both data sets. These limitations yielded a total
of 336 males charged with terrorism-related offenses between 1987 and 2002 from the ATS
and 923 comparable cases from the USSC.10 The analytic file was created using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Corporation, Chicago, IL).The final analysis file contained
a total of 1,259 male felons processed between 1987 and 2002.
9.The n randomly selected from the USSC was determined by our desire for the USSC cases to outnumber
the ATS cases by about three to one to increase statistical power while not overwhelming the number of
ATS cases. Three times 374 is 1,122 and we rounded this to the nearest five to arrive at our final USSC n of
1,225.
10. Female cases were removed from the final data set during the initial stages of development when it was
determined that the small number of females (relative to males) in both data sets introduced instabil-
ity into the statistical analysis and that no relationship existed between gender and any of the outcome
variables. This is common to studies of gun violence (Lizotte and Sheppard, 2001). The lack of female cases
in the ATS is particularly acute with only 38 female indictees in the data.

Methods11
To establish baseline relationships among our variables and between the two groups (terrorists
and felons), we first performed bivariate tests of independence and correlation coefficients.The
next method for describing differences in terrorists and felons involved estimating a series of
logistic regressions on the pooled data. Using this method allows a comprehensive depiction
of the outcomes while other relevant variables are held constant. Logistic regression allows the
interpretation of resulting coefficients as odds statements and does not assume a linear functional
form (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984). Furthermore, we can determine the odds of firearm crime
involvement based on each independent variable using this method (Long, 1997). Another
advantage of logistic regression, aside from its desirable properties when estimating limited
dependent variables, is the ease with which one may interpret the outcomes of the equations.12
Finally, we can test for differences between the subsets of primary firearm crime (use and pos-
session) to determine whether observed differences in the coefficients of these equations occur
by chance or whether they indicate a difference in behavior (Cohen, 1983).13
We conducted two additional analyses. First, logistic models were estimated with data
weighted to correct for the oversampling of terrorists. Finally, to take additional steps to remove
extra causal factors from the model disturbance, we estimated conditional fixed-effects logistic
regression equations, fixing the courtroom effects of the 96 federal court districts.This portion
of the analysis represents an effort to address any unobserved variation in courtroom culture and
prosecutorial discretion. These analytic techniques and results are presented in Appendix A.
The Variables
Firearm charges. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables.The primary dependent
concept measured in this analysis is illegal use and possession of firearms as measured by criminal
firearm charges. We used four dichotomous measures to capture the illegal use and possession
of firearms: (1) charged with any firearm offense, (2) charged with any firearm crime as a primary
offense, (3) charged with firearm use as a primary offense, and (4) firearm possession as a primary
offense. We coded all four measures 1 for charged with the firearm offense in question and 0
for not charged. Approximately 18.5% of the entire sample was charged with a firearm offense,
followed by 15.8% being charged with a primary firearm offense.14 Fewer than 2% (1.7) were

12. When the coefficients of a logistic regression are exponentiated and transformed through a simple
formula, we may interpret the result as a percent change in odds of the dependent variable for a one-
unit change on the independent variable while holding all other variables constant. The transformation
formula used here is as follows: percent change in the odds ratio = (e ­1)*100.
13. In this case, the t test is distributed as where a z score of 1.65 is p < .05. The formula for calculating the
z scores is as follows:
(see also Paternoster, Brame, Mazerolle, and Piquero, 1998).
14.These measures are similar to measures of federal prisoners'self-reports of gun use, which further supports
our confidence in the validity of these data (Wolf Harlow, 2001).

accused of firearm use and 7% were implicated in firearm possession.
Because the data were abstracted from the ATS and USSC statutory codes, these variables
are crude indicators only and cannot distinguish between firearm types (e.g., whether pistols or
long guns) and are not sensitive to bullet caliber, manufacturer, or style of firearm. Nevertheless,
we assume that the use of official court records is a valid measure of criminal offending. Previous
research on firearm use by offenders has shown a high degree of reliability between prosecuto-
rial charging behavior and actual firearm-related offending (Lizotte and Zatz, 1986; Loftin and
McDowall, 1981). In other words, if an individual is charged with more serious crimes and a
firearm is involved, then firearm charges also are included. Furthermore, the strict definitions of
firearm-use crimes at the federal level require specific alleged actions on the part of the defendant
and do not include the mere possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (Scalia,
2000), which lends yet more confidence to this particular measure. In both the ATS and the
USSC, firearm involvement was defined by official courtroom action and any measurement
error would be more likely caused by stochastic processes rather than by data definitional issues.
In other words, we assumed that being charged with a firearm crime indicates involvement with
firearms and that an absence of firearm charges indicates no firearm involvement.
Terrorism status. The main independent variable in this analysis is whether the defendant
was a terrorist. This item was coded 1 or 0 depending on the data source from which the indi-
vidual was drawn. Defendants from the ATS data were coded 1, and those from the USSC data
were coded 0. The ATS data contain individuals formally indicted in a court of law as part of
the FBI's counterterrorism program (Smith and Damphousse, 2006). The formal indictment
provides high confidence that individuals from that source were in fact involved in terrorist
activity. The USSC data are a record of individuals charged in the federal court system who
were not involved in terrorism.The combined data include 336 (26.7%) individuals identified
by the FBI as terrorists and 923 (73.3%) nonterrorists from the USSC sentencing data.
Criminal activity. The next three items represent individuals' degrees of criminal activity
using three variables. First, we included a measure of the defendants' federal criminal history
score. Ranging from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most severe), the average federal criminal history
score is 2.3 in this sample.15 The second indicator of seriousness of criminality is the number of
months sentenced to prison. Although the authors recognize that sentencing under the federal
system remains highly structured by the federal guidelines (U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2006),
15.The criteria for these scores are outlined in the USSC's Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.
Sentencing Commission, 2007). However, we could not dichotomize criminal history into previous felony
indictment or no previous felony indictment. Determining whether the offender was previously convicted
of a felony is not possible because of the complex coding of the criminal history score. The criminal his-
tory score is calculated by using a multistage process that evaluates prior offenses by sentence length,
whether the offenders were adjudicated as adults or juveniles, release dates from custody, whether of-
fenses were committed while under sentence for another criminal offense, time since last offense, escape
status, and the nature of previous offenses. By evaluating each of these characteristics, the USSC sums the
total points and then uses these points to assign a criminal history category score.

the number of months sentenced to prison is a potent indicator of the severity of defendants'
most recent crimes as well as their criminal history (Tonry, 1996). When used in conjunction
with other criminal history variables in multivariate models, this indicator more precisely
measures the severity of the current offense. The average number of months sentenced was 67.
Our third measure of criminal severity is whether the offender had a leading or aggravating
role in his primary offense of conviction. Research on terrorism (Sageman, 2004) suggested
that some individuals who play a central role in terrorist organizations may be more likely to
engage in a greater amount of offending. Similarly, we expected that nonterrorist criminals
who were in leading or aggravating roles during primary offenses would commit more severe
crimes. Nearly 12% of offenders in the combined ATS-USSC data set were in a leadership or
otherwise aggravating role.
Control variables. Our indicator of citizenship is an important control variable. Recent
literature noted that some terrorists are drawn from immigrant communities (Rapoport, 2001)
and prior work on firearm offending suggests that firearm offending may be lower among im-
migrant offenders (Wolf Harlow, 2001). Thus, we included citizenship to improve the focus
on our comparisons and to account for mid-level sociodemographic contextual variables. Citi-
zenship was measured using a dichotomous variable. Approximately 66% of the total sample
were U.S. citizens.
To control for possible confounding variables associated with demographic characteristics
and to compare felons versus terrorists in their firearms involvement, we also included age and
race variables. Age was defined as the defendant's age at conviction and the average age of the
offenders in the combined ATS-USSC data was 35.3 years. Ethnicity was captured using four
dichotomous variables. Approximately 24.2% of all USSC-ATS felons were African American,
27.6% were Latino, 46% were white, and only 2% were listed as "other".
Finally, we included a measure of the number of charges levied against the defendant to
control for a possible higher level of aggressive prosecutions against terrorists. It is entirely prob-
able that prosecutors view terrorism as a form of heinous crime and therefore simply "throw the
book" at terrorists. Accordingly, we included the total number of criminal counts to control for
the possible confounding effect of differential case handling. The average number of criminal
counts against defendants in this sample was approximately 3.7.
Results
Bivariate
The results from Table 2 indicate that terrorists and felons are distinct in several important
ways. The bivariate results paint a picture of the U.S. terrorist as being more heavily firearm
involved, older, usually white, and having a less extensive offending history than other felons.
In this regard, the percentage differentials are large: A total of 40% of terrorists were charged
with a gun-related crime, compared with 10.5% of felons. On average, terrorists were 37 years
of age and federal felons were 34. Fully 76.5% of terrorists were white, while 35.3% of felons

were white. Finally, terrorists had an average criminal history score nearly a point less than
nonterrorists (1.45 v. 2.42).

Results from the correlation matrix in Table 3 are consistent with Table 2 and suggest
some important consistencies between the data sets. Our measure of terrorism was positively
correlated with firearm crime (r = .344), age (r = .099), and being white (r = .363). Similar to
the contingency tables, the correlations show that terrorists are associated with lower criminal
history scores (­.206). Both of these results, then, provide initial support for our first and second
hypotheses--that terrorists have less of a criminal history and participate in more firearm crime
than other felons.They also suggest that prosecutorial behavior might have an important effect:
Terrorists are charged with about eight times the number of offenses as other felons.
Other results from the correlation tables are consistent with previous studies and suggest
important race and citizenship dynamics. For example, Latinos were less likely to be involved
with firearms, as evidenced by their negative and significant correlations with all four measures
of firearm violations.16 Similarly, we found that U.S. citizenship was related to a higher likeli-
hood of all types of firearm charges.The data also indicate that African Americans had a longer
formal criminal record (r = .170) and that being African American was associated with longer
sentence lengths (r = .162).
16.This finding is consistent with previous examinations of federal firearm offenders (Scalia, 2000; Wolf
Harlow, 2001).

Multivariate
Table 4 presents the results of the logistic regression equations estimating the effects of each
of the independent variables on each of the four firearm crime variables. The findings from
this analysis provide additional support for three of the four hypotheses. In seven of the eight
models, being a terrorist significantly increased the odds of being charged with firearm offenses.
The first column details the simple odds ratios for all cases with any firearm, without including
a measure of criminal history. In this equation, being in the terrorist group increased the odds
of being indicted with any firearm offense by more than fourfold. Being Latino reduced the
odds of being indicted with any firearm crime by 90%. Finally, being a U.S. citizen more than
doubled the odds of being indicted for a firearm crime.
Estimates in the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth columns included a control for criminal
history to test our fourth hypothesis. In each of these cases, the idea that criminal history medi-
ates the relationship between terrorist and firearm offenses was supported by the considerable
increase in parameter estimates for terrorists' participation in any firearm crime for all four
outcome models. Controlling for the effect of the criminal history variable reveals the full extent
of terrorist participation in firearm crime. For instance, when criminal history is included in
the model, there is an almost ninefold increase in the odds of terrorists being charged with any
firearm crime compared with nonterrorists. This is much higher than the fourfold difference
observed in the equation that did not include criminal history to mediate the relationship and
illustrates the suppression effect of criminal history on terrorists' participation in firearm crime:
Those few terrorists with extensive criminal histories, then, were charged with firearm crimes
more often than other felons, but the effect was more pronounced when controlling for varia-
tion in criminal history.This finding stands in stark contrast to previous research on felons that
identified extensive criminal history as being a predictor of current gun involvement.
The fourth column reports the equation for firearm charges as a primary offense. In this case,
terrorists had approximately six times higher odds of having a gun charge as a primary offense
than did other criminals. In addition, criminal history became a significant predictor, increas-
ing the odds of a primary firearm offense by approximately 57%, and the effect of citizenship
intensified to approximately a tenfold increase in odds. Finally, the severity of crime (measured
by the number of months sentenced) changed direction compared with the first model, reducing
the odds of being charged with a primary firearm offense by 0.6% per month sentenced.
The sixth column presents the results for gun use as a primary crime. This is the largest
disparity between terrorists and other criminals with a more-than-20-fold increase in the odds
of being charged with firearm use for members of the terrorist group. We note here that the
terrorist variable and age are the only variables in the equation that explain variation in the
firearm use variable and the strong finding could be an artifact because only approximately 1%
of all the cases in the data involved firearm use as a primary offense.
Finally, the last column details the equation for firearm possession as a primary offense.
In this case, being in the terrorist group increased the odds of being charged with firearm pos-

session as a primary offense about fourfold over the nonterrorist group. Next, we compared
the terrorist coefficients in the firearm use and possession equations as subsets of the primary
firearm variable. Although initial inspections supported the conclusion that firearm use was
more common than possession among terrorists as compared with criminals, we found that
this difference was not statistically significant when examined with a cross coefficient test and
that it does not support the third hypothesis that terrorists will show a large difference between
firearm use and possession compared with other felons.17 Criminal history also exhibited strong
17.Calculating the cross coefficient test for these equations produces z = .0843 with p = .466, which fails to
reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are different in the population.

effects on firearm possession: Each increase in criminal history score produced a 60% increase
in the odds of firearm possession. Months sentenced decreased the odds of firearm possession
by approximately 6% for each additional month, and U.S. citizenship increased the odds of
firearm possession by more than eightfold.
Finally,weestimatedtheseequationswiththeweighteddataandusedconditionalfixed-effects
models of the data to control for the oversample of terrorists and for the effects of courtroom
actors, respectively. The results of these additional models did not differ substantively from
the models already reported. Complete details about these methods and results are reported
in Appendix A.
Summary of Findings
Three of the four hypotheses are supported by these results. Overall, and perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, firearm charges were positively related to criminal offending, with criminal history being
positively and significantly related to primary firearm crime and being charged with possession
of a firearm as a primary offense. Terrorists, the main variable of interest, displayed strong
positive effects in each of the equations, a pattern that supports the hypothesis that terrorists
participate in more firearm crime than other felons. Nonetheless, the odds of being charged
with firearm use (as opposed to possession) for terrorists were not significantly different than
nonterrorist felons, a finding that fails to support the third hypothesis. The relatively small
number of firearm-use cases and consequent lack of variation and power for this dependent
variable could be driving this result. Finally, the fourth hypothesis--a mediated relationship
between terrorists and firearm crime because of criminal history differences--is supported by
the suppression effect noted in each of the models presented.
Discussion and Conclusion
These findings concur with previous research using the ATS suggesting that individual terror-
ists are frequently charged with firearm offenses (Hamm, 2007). They are also consistent with
research that found that terrorists are more likely to use firearms for assassinations than are
nonterrorists (Lyons and Harbinson, 1986) and with research from terrorist-incident databases
indicating that firearm-based attacks are the second most common type of recorded occurrence
(Jackson and Frelinger, 2007; LaFree, Dugan, Fogg, and Scott, 2006).
Although this consistency with previous literature provides additional confidence in the
findings, there are limitations to the analyses. First, we lack information regarding the specific
type of firearm used, firearm preference, and circumstances conditioning weapon type use.
Perhaps more importantly, direct measures of weapon use in terrorist attacks versus supporting
crimes are absent; unfortunately, these data do not yet exist. It will be important to collect new
data to address the specific details and motivations of terrorists at an individual level.
Second, both the ATS and the USSC data are drawn primarily from federal prosecutions
and do not include cases tried in state courts. Although current indications suggest that the
Weapon Choice and American Political Violence
Criminology & Public Policy
550
bulk of terrorism-related cases are tried in federal courts, some states may contribute to this
total as well (cf. Simone, Freilich, and Chermak, 2008). Although we expect that this will not
fundamentally undermine the findings of this study, it is important to understand that not
all cases tried and punished in federal courts result from a violation of federal firearm statutes.
Federally sponsored firearm violence-reduction strategies such as Operation Ceasefire and
Exile try defendants in federal courts who would traditionally have been tried in state criminal
courts. This limitation is not particularly threatening, however, because it serves only to make
a rejection of the null hypothesis more difficult.That is, if additional firearm felons were in the
sample that were not in the terrorist group, then it would be more difficult to find that being
involved in terrorist activities increases the odds of participating in firearm-related crime. In
short, this potential for systematic error in the data serves only to increase the difficulty in sup-
porting our hypotheses. In any case, the unique nature of these data and the opportunity to
compare terrorists and other types of felons quantitatively at the individual level far outweighs
these shortcomings.
Future research should attempt to shed light on the dynamics of weapon choice among
individual terrorists. In particular, additional research examining the interplay between terror-
ism and type of firearm would be very informative. Prior research has suggested that felons
are primarily interested in easily concealed handguns (Wolf Harlow, 2001; Wright and Rossi,
1994), but terrorists may be more interested in offensive weapons such as shotguns and semi-
automatic rifles. Understanding weapon choice is vital to understanding the routine criminal
activities of terrorists in the United States. Previous work (Hamm, 2002, 2007) suggested that
terrorists may differ from felons in their involvement with explosives, which are not the com-
mon weapons of ordinary criminals.This suggests that researchers or policymakers interested in
better understanding terrorism may want to study terrorist weapon choice and preference--just
as others have studied criminal weapon choice and use in the past to inform criminal justice
policy (e.g., Cook et al., 1995; Lizotte, Krohn, Howell, Tobin, and Howard, 2000; Lizotte,
Tesoriero, Thornberry, and Krohn, 1994).
Terrorist group type may be an important variable as well. Hoffman (2006) argued that
left-wing violence is distinguishable from right-wing violence by the left's use of innovative
tactics and specific targets. Based on these findings, one would expect right-wing groups to
be more apt to possess and use firearms than left-wing groups. Accordingly, future research
on firearm involvement should explicitly examine differential patterns of firearm use between
types of terrorist groups.
Finally, these findings support at least one specific recommendation for policy. Because
terrorists tend to have less extensive criminal histories, they might find it easier to obtain firearms
legally through available primary market retail sources and to pass Brady background checks--
both of which suggest that policymakers should continue to include the Violent Gang and
Terrorist Organization File (VGOTF) as part of the Brady NICS criteria. More importantly,
however, procedural changes regarding how that information is communicated to federal and
Legault · Hendrickson

state law-enforcement agencies should be improved in light of the proclivity of terrorists in this
sample of federal felons to participate in firearm crimes, a lack of coordination on this subject
between state and federal agencies, and a history of allowing these purchases to be completed
(U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2005).
Current federal restrictions on firearm purchases forbid the sale or transfer of firearms
to people who are indicted or convicted of felonies, fugitives from justice, addicted to or use
controlled substances, adjudicated as mentally defective, identified as illegal aliens, discharged
from the armed forces under dishonorable conditions, recognized as previous citizens who
have renounced U.S. citizenship, subject to a court protective order restraining contact with an
intimate partner, or convicted of a misdemeanor or domestic violence (The Gun Control Act of
1968, 2006). Currently, no provisions are in place to prevent individuals named in theVGOTF
from purchasing weapons unless they are otherwise ineligible (Krouse, 2005). Furthermore, the
U.S. Government Accountability Office (2005: 21) reported that federal law-enforcement and
counterterrorism authorities have "`not routinely monitored states' handling of NICS transac-
tions involving terrorist records in the VGOTF." We recommend that this integration of the
VGOTF with NICS checks be continued with additional FBI counterterrorism oversight and
coordination and that a provision to prevent firearm sales to individuals listed in the VGOTF
(with proper oversight) be enacted. For instance, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to
Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007 (S. 1237) currently proposes to deny people named on the
VGTOF list the right to possess a firearm and allows for remedy through the discretion of the
attorney general (U.S. Congress, 2007). This bill also allows the attorney general to withhold
information regarding the denial of a firearm purchase if the information is considered to be a
matter of national security--although we are not sure how this might be germane to domes-
tic terrorism and it would justifiably draw the ire of civil rights groups as well as gun rights
activists. The ability to deny the right to purchase a gun based on VGOTF membership may
be necessary considering that, during the 5 months of the U.S. Government Accountability
Office study, the NICS recorded approximately 650 hits on terrorist lists, of which only 44
were valid. Of the 44 valid alerts, 35 were ultimately allowed to proceed for lack of cause for
denial, 6 transactions were denied, 1 was not resolved, and 2 were listed as "unknown status"
(U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2005). Considering the evidence presented here, it
is probably more prudent to impose greater law-enforcement oversight and involvement rather
than to try to impose and enforce additional purchasing restrictions.

Appendix A
Oversample Weights
One obstacle to making direct comparisons between the ATS and the USSC data is the gross
oversample, and hence overrepresentation, of terrorists in the data. The data include 923 fel-
ons randomly sampled from a total of 511,466 cases processed under the federal system.18 In
contrast, all available terrorists from the same time period--336--were included in the data.
Terrorism prosecutions are rare, which presents a degree of methodological difficulty in modeling
terrorist behavior.19 To compare the two data sets, weights were calculated to compensate for
the discrepancy in the relative sizes of the groups.20 Both weighted and unweighted descriptive
statistics are reported in Table 1.
Failure to include such weights can lead to biased parameter estimates (Wang, Yu, and
Lin, 1997). Inclusion of weights, however, can have unwanted effects on inferential statistics
by inflating standard errors, which increases the likelihood of error. As a result, Winship and
Radbill (1994) recommended not including oversample weights when the parameter estimates
between weighted and unweighted models are the same.Therefore, all statistical tests and analyses
were performed on both the weighted and unweighted data. No substantive differences were
found in the interpretation of findings or in the standard errors.This being the case, we elected
to present and interpret the unweighted results (Winship and Radbill, 1994) and we do not
report weighted equations here.21 To allow for the possibility that the standard errors might
be inflated, all models are estimated using Huber-White robust standard errors. In sum, we
chose to include the more conservative, smaller parameter estimates and the more conservative
robust standard errors.
The Conditional Fixed-Effects Logistic Model
The data used for this analysis are official courtroom statistics. Accordingly, individual outcomes
in these contexts are influenced by a host of factors inherent in the local courtroom context.These
factors are the local informal legal cultures; social dynamics among judges, defense attorneys,
18. Although the original population of the USSC is 631,869, this is the number of males in the USSC popula-
tion and is the population N used to calculate the weighting scheme for the final data set used in the
analysis.
19.The authors note that, in 2002, there were approximately 370 U.S. federal homicide convictions (Maguire
and Pastore, 2004) but only 38 prosecutions of terrorists (authors'calculations--not shown). These data
suggest a ratio of 1 terrorist prosecuted to every 9.73 homicides. In short, terrorism cases in the federal
system are far rarer than even the infrequent crime of homicide.
20.Simple probability weights were calculated and used as oversample weights. The weight calculations
were performed by determining the sampling proportion of the terrorist group, using this number to
determine the expected number of terrorist cases in a simple random sample, dividing the expected pro-
portion by the actual n, subtracting this number from the actual sample size, and dividing the expected
size by the actual sample size.
21. All parameter estimates were in the same direction; however, the weighted results were of a greater mag-
nitude. We chose to report the more conservative estimates here. Although not reported, the weighted
results are available upon request.

and prosecutors; and attitudes of courtroom actors toward the perceived harm of criminal acts
(Eisenstein, Flemming, and Nardulli, 1999).
To account for these potential courtroom-level effects, we estimated conditional fixed-
effects logistic regression models, which allow for the user to hold constant unobserved, stable
variation (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002) in groups, such as geographic areas, in this case
96 federal court districts.The unconditional logistic fixed-effects model has often been cited as
an appropriate model for the study of logistically distributed dependent variables across time in
panel data (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002). However, these models usually rely on a series of
dichotomous variables representing each of the concepts under investigation, thus introducing
the possibility of incidental parameter bias (Allison andWaterman, 2002). Conditional models,
however, allow for the examination of case control and matched data while fixing and separating
higher-level effects from all of the individual-level effects in the model; these models do not
include the additional parameter estimates in the final model.
In the case of the conditional fixed-effect model, each fixed-effect term is conditioned
on the constant term of the logit estimator, in this case, it allows us to control for unobserved
variation in the 96 federal court districts that may be caused by variation in district policies or
variation in courtroom behavior without the disadvantages inherent in adding 95 additional
variables to the equation. The conditional logistic fixed-effects model is well suited for the
inherent structure of the analytic data, but it is not without shortcomings. First, because the
constant term is used to compute the fixed effects, it is lost to the model. As the constant term is
not of particular substantive interest in our analysis, this has no negative effect on our findings.
Second, the conditional fixed-effects model must drop all cases that do not vary within a group-
ing (Greene, 2003; Wooldridge, 2002). In this case, any federal district that had no terrorism
cases was dropped from the analysis due to lack of within-group variation, which resulted in
the loss of a large portion of the individual cases in the data to hold constant the unobserved
variation in districts and in the complete loss of the firearm use equations.
The outcome of the conditional fixed-effects logit model is reported in Table A1. Because
of lack of cases and variation between districts, the firearm-use equation failed to estimate. We
would like to note, however, that in the three equations with sufficient data, the parameter
estimates were not substantively different than those in the equations reported in Table 4. This
model and modeling technique may prove more useful as more individual-level data become
available with large sample sizes. In this case, it adds to our analysis by providing an additional
control--beyond the number of counts for each case--for the possibility that systematic varia-
tions in courtroom behavior in federal courts are the cause of the observed relationship between
terrorists and firearm charges.
