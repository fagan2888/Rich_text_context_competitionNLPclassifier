Introduction
As more people move into urban areas, by 2050 more than
70% of the world's population will live in cities (Footer,
2015). Cities are important drivers of economic and cultural
growth based on knowledge-driven ecosystems. As incuba-
tors of creativity and the burgeoning cultural industries, cit-
ies attract the human capital of the music industry (Florida,
2002, 2012). An illustrative case of this is Melbourne, which
is not only the capital of Victoria but also branded as the
music capital of Australia (Melbourne confirmed as live
music capital, 2013, Baker, 2014). With a population of
more than 4.5 million, Melbourne is currently the second
largest city in Australia after Sydney. By 2051, Melbourne is
predicted to be Australia's most populated city (Savage,
2014). This article highlights that Melbourne's music brand-
ing is primarily examined by applying a mathematical flow-
chart of economic algorithms, which is "a step-by-step
procedure of calculations" (Solórzano, 2014, p. 1) used to
define the value of music activity in an urban context.
Algorithm A (Economics) is associated with uncovering the
financial impact of the music industry across revenue prof-
its, employment figures, audience participation, and the
number of music venues. However, as this article highlights,
Algorithm A, other algorithms such as Algorithm B (Four
T's creative index) and Algorithm C (Heritage), used to
assess music activity in urban areas, are associated with
limitations, and therefore paint a half picture about the
"music cities paradigm" (Baker, 2016, p. 334). To complete
this analysis, the article is divided into three sections. The
first section examines the three existing algorithms (A-C)
and assesses their contributions to the definition of a music
city. The second section is a case study of how using
Algorithms A and B as an assessment tool to assess
Melbourne's music capital status generates disputed claims.
The final section proposes a benchmark Algorithm D to
assess music activity in the urban context and offers a com-
prehensive definition of a music city.

Algorithms to Assess Music Cities: Case
Study--Melbourne as a Music Capital
Andréa Jean Baker1
Abstract
The global Mastering of a Music City report in 2015 notes that the concept of music cities has penetrated the global political
vernacular because it delivers "significant economic, employment, cultural and social benefits." This article highlights that no
empirical study has combined all these values and offers a relevant and comprehensive definition of a music city. Drawing on
industry research,1 the article assesses how mathematical flowcharts, such as Algorithm A (Economics), Algorithm B (Four
T's creative index), and Algorithm C (Heritage), have contributed to the definition of a music city. Taking Melbourne as a
case study, it illustrates how Algorithms A and B are used as disputed evidence about whether the city is touted as Australia's
music capital. The article connects the three algorithms to an academic framework from musicology, urban studies, cultural
economics, and sociology, and proposes a benchmark Algorithm D (Music Cities definition), which offers a more holistic
assessment of music activity in any urban context. The article concludes by arguing that Algorithm D offers a much-needed
definition of what comprises a music city because it builds on the popular political economy focus and includes the social
importance of space and cultural practices.

cities," suggests, "a music city" is defined as an urban area
with a "vibrant music economy" (Terrill, Hogarth, Clement,
& Francis, 2015, p. 5). There has been a significant amount
of published academic work by economists about the cost
associated with the music industry such as concert tickets,
production costs, and digital downloads and streaming
(Cameron, 2016). However, Algorithm A, based on four key
variables (financial revenue, employment, audience partici-
pation, and the number of music venues), remains the
denominator to define music cities. In the case of Melbourne,
industry reports such as the 2011 Economic, Social and
Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria
(also known as the Deloitte Report2) and the 2012 Victorian
Music Census (Newton, 2012) argue that Melbourne is the
live music capital of Australia for two main reasons: first,
because Melbourne has more live music venues (465) than
any other city in Australia, and second, because Victoria gen-
erates more than Aus$1.04 billion in revenue annually. This
is similar to the music revenue (US$1.06 billion) of Austin,
the capital of Texas, in the United States which is the self-
proclaimed "Live Music Capital of the World" (Rowling,
2015, p. 5). In 1991, Austin adopted this music branding
because the city had more live venues per capita (approxi-
mately 250) than any other city in the United States (Terrill
et al., 2015; Baker, 2014).
The live music venue variable associated with
Algorithm A is also noted in the 2015 World Cities
Cultural Report (Table 3), which was first commissioned
by the then Major of London, Johnson, in 2012 and con-
ducted again in 2013 (Johnston, 2012, 2013). The world
report examines thirty-one global cities,3 and Melbourne
and Austin were included for the first time (Table 3;
Simons, 2015). This report contends that Los Angeles
(510) had the most live music venues, followed by New
York City (453), Sydney (435), Tokyo (385), London
(245), then Bogato (166) (Simons, 2015). These statistics
support music scholars Connell and Gibson's (2003, p.
29) contention that the "authenticity" and "credibility" of
music scenes are heavily linked to a "live music" culture.
As these scholars argue, if a city has a vibrant live music
culture, then local musicians will base themselves there
and have a "home field advantage" in the "glocalisation"
of music (Connell & Gibson, 2003, p. 14).
The 2015 World Cities Cultural Report also highlights
two points in relation to music cities. First, the report's statis-
tics support U.S. musicologist Lewis's (cited in Garrett &
Oja, 2011) view that the traditional location of the global
music industry is "a Euro-American construct" (p.692) and
largely based in the "superstar music cities" (Florida, 2015,
p. 1) of New York City, Los Angeles, and London. Urban
economist Florida concurs with Lewis by contending that
these three cities can claim superstar status not only because

of their abundant facilities and financial impact but because
of their musical histories, nonstop music events, and cultural,
economic, and business power and influence in the global
industry.
Second, while the 2015 World Cities Cultural Report
offers much-needed comparable figures about music activity
across different cities, its findings contradict other industry
studies. For example, in regard to theAustralian music scene,
the world report contends that Sydney has more live music
venues than Melbourne. This differs from local reports, such
as the Deloitte Report (Economic, Social and Cultural
Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011)
and Victorian Live Music Census (Newton, 2012), which say
that Melbourne has more live music venues (465) than
Sydney (431). The world report also did not include Austin,
the Live Music Capital of the World, in its live music venues
table. However, as noted, Austin has more than 250 live
music venues, which is higher than London (245) and Bogato
(166), cited in the world report (Simons, 2015). Contradictory
findings like this about music cities research are an issue that
United Kingdom (UK). music entrepreneur Elbourne
expanded on during his biannual Global Music Cities con-
ventions (Table 4),4 which began in May 2015. As Elbourne
(2013) previously noted, it is "difficult to gain a clear picture
of the music industry both here and around the world due to
a lack of comparable facts and figures" (p. 15).
Limitations. Limitations associated with usingAlgorithmAto
assess music in an urban context are associated with two fac-
tors: (a) music definitions and (b) narrow focus on econom-
ics. First, the term music has definitions irregularities and
diverse cultural practices (Cook & Eversit, 1999; Hesmond-
halgh & Negus, 2002). For example, the local reports about
music cities such as Melbourne (Economic, Social and Cul-
tural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,
2011; Newton, 2012) or the global circuit (Terrill et al., 2015)
focus on commercial, popular live music and the nighttime
economy. Admittedly, the early years of music studies were
dominated by easily defined genres such as classical, fol-
lowed by jazz and then rock. However, with newer urban
music genres, such as hip hop, techno, electronic, dance, and
world music, music definitions began to blur within the
daytime and nighttime economies (Hesmondhalgh & Negus,
2002). As a result, today there are "many conflicting mean-
ings clustered" around the terms "music" and "culture."
The academy and the industry have long challenged the
cultural distinction between music and nonmusic, live music
and recorded music (Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002). These
incomplete definitions reduce music to "reductive and ste-
reotypical representation" and narratives (Cohen, 2007, p.
53) associated with cities' musical sounds. It also feeds into
the "commercially constructed strategic essentialism of
place" (Connell & Gibson, 2003, p. 112, cited in Cohen,
2007, p. 54). These incomplete definitions also reflect the

need for empirical research which encapsulates all genres of
music, from live and recorded, from classical to pop within
the urban context. For example, the City of Melbourne's
Music Strategy (2014-2017) offers a broad and inclusive
definition of music because it includes
any live or recorded musical performance by a singer,
instrumentalist, group, Disc Jockey (D.J), busker or street
performer, which takes place in a traditional venue such as a bar,
pub, theater, restaurant or club or in a non-traditional venue such
as a warehouse, shop, car park or other outdoor public space.
(Leppert & Doyle, 2014, p. 10)
This article acknowledges that it is often impossible for any
report examining a music landscape to identify all genres of
music, but studies that do offer a more holistic picture of the
"music city paradigm" (Baker, 2016, p. 334).As Cohen (2007)
notes, the relationship between a city and music is "not deter-
ministic," "organic," or "homological" (p. 68). DeNora (2000)
expands on Cohen's point by noting that music is "a way of
happening . . . over time and in particular ways" (p. 158).
Second, studies about the economic impact of music cities
have overshadowed its social­cultural impact, which, aca-
demics (Homan, 2014; Shaw & Porter, 2009) argue, requires
critical attention because it offers a wider perspective on the
dynamics of consumption and production. As urban sociolo-
gist Pratt (2009) contends, the "culturalisation" linkage to
"economization," while "endemic in late capitalism," is limit-
ing because it is linked to a narrow approach (p. 4). Cultural
economists Hutter and Throsby (2008) concur with Pratt, by
arguing that the cultural turn in the economization of the arts
has reflected that there is a cultural value beyond a price tag.
Another cultural economist Jackson (2009) builds on these
claims by noting that an economic focus on cultural activity
offers a narrow concept of cultural power and authority and
fails to offer an evolutionary or historical view of the world.
In the case of Melbourne, branding the city as a music
capital of Australia has mainly been based on purely eco-
nomic values. However, this approach has failed to account
for the social and cultural impact of urbanization such as
high-density living, residential development, local planning,
and regulation and licensing laws (Homan, 2014; Shaw &
Porter, 2009, Lucas, 2015a). As scholars (Hutter & Throsby,
2008, Throsby & Zednik, 2010, Jackson, 2009; Pratt, 2009)
contend, the focus on the economization of culture has
resulted in the failure to draw on more holistic, social and
cultural interpretative fields of qualitative investigation.
Throsby (2010, cited in Petrova, 2011, p. 237) who is known
for navigating "between neoclassical economics and the per-
spective of political economy" expands on this point by not-
ing that cultural economics needs to be "flexible, open
minded and receptive to the intellectual influence of other
disciplines in the social sciences and humanities." Throsby
(2010, cited in Petrova, 2011, p. 238) highlights that in recent
years, "cultural policy has broadened its scope" to include
concepts such as the creative city, which the next section
details.
Algorithm B (Four T's Creative Index)
Algorithm B is associated with what urban economist Florida
calls the four T's index of a creative city, which includes
variables such as technology, talent, tolerance, and territorial
assets. Florida (2002) argues that the four T's are indicators
of a city that are welcoming to the creative class such as
those from the music industry. In his 2002 groundbreaking
book, The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida argues that
branding your city a creative music hub generates income
from tourism dollars, which stimulates the local economy
and urban development. With concerns to the first T in the
index, technology, Florida argues that it fuels an entrepre-
neurial culture, which sustains the information society.
Today, the music link to Internet technology is critical. The
second T in the index, Talent, is an ingredient based on edu-
cated, skilled, and creative occupations, which can reflect a
music population. The third T in the index, tolerance, is less
tangible to measure and is linked to lifestyle choices and
based on a live and let live motto. To address criticism that
Florida's work fails to address issues of class, race, and
geography (Timberg, 2015) ), in the 2012 edition of Rise of
the Creative Class­Revisited Florida added a fourth T, terri-
torial assets, which examines the quality and attractiveness
of a city.
Data mining government statistical reports and occupa-
tion indexes in relation to the first, three T's (technology, tol-
erance, and talent) in 2002 Florida claimed that over one
third of the U.S. population were members of the creative
class. Derived from this research, Florida argues that Austin,
the self-proclaimed, Live Music Capital of the World, is also
the U.S. poster child of his three T's Creative Cities Index.
However, Austin was barely a blip on the global music radar
until the South by South West (SXSW, Inc.) music confer-
ence began in 1987, which has now evolved into the presti-
gious, influential, and largest global music event. In 2012,
Austin still ranked highly in Florida's revised Creative Cities
Index. As the first ever Austin Music Census, a Data Driven
Assessment of Austin's Commercial Music Economy, pub-
lished on June 1, 2015, noted, "Austin has [long been] been
a leader among cities in presenting itself as a music city"
(Rowling, 2015, p.5). After visiting Austin and attending the
SXSW, Inc., music festival in 2011, Music Victoria's chief
executive officer, Patrick Donovan (2011), a former music
journalist with the Melbourne-based masthead, The Age
newspaper, proclaimed that "Melbourne is the Austin of the
Southern Hemisphere" (p. 2). However, Melbourne is not
mentioned in Florida's four T's creative index, but his final T
(territorial assets) aligns with The Economist's Intelligence
Unit's (EIU) Liveability Survey of 140 cities,5 where
Melbourne has earned the EIU title as the most livable city in
the world since 2010 (Lucas, 2015b; Nikakis, 2013). Culture
Baker 5
within the EIU ranking criteria is broadly defined and also
includes a city's "arts [educational] and cultural infrastruc-
ture," which is "often regarded as a significant reason for its
status" (Homan, 2014, p. 151).
Limitations.Limitations of Algorithm B are associated with
the failure to acknowledge the wider social­cultural context.
As Pratt (2009) contends, Florida's creative class analysis of
partly focusing on occupation fails to capture the social repro-
duction of labor and knowledge in the cultural industries. He
argues that Florida's conceptualization and definition of cre-
ative occupation are narrow and unclear. In response to Flor-
ida's work, Pratt (2009) develops a statistical framework that
defines the breadth and depth of cultural practices known as
"cultural mapping" (p. 7). This mapping exercise focuses on
the industry as a whole, rather than occupation, which is a
focus of Florida's work. Pratt's cultural mapping is a similar
approach to what is used by United Nations Educational, Sci-
entific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Creative Cit-
ies Network6 in their accreditation process of labeling Cities
of Music, as the next section reflects.
Algorithm C (Heritage)
Algorithm C (Heritage) is tied UNESCO's City of Music
accreditation process, a process which first began in 2006.
For a city to be awarded this UNESCO music title, it needs
to illustrate six variables, the most obvious variable being
music heritage, along with five other variables such as excel-
lent background in music-making, education, community
involvement, regular high-profile local music events, and
international music events. In 2015, there were 12 UNESCO
Cities of Music, and over half of them are in Europe and the
UK such as Liverpool, which was awarded the status in 2014
(Table 5).
As the birthplace of the 1960s pop group, The Beatles'
musical heritage of Liverpool in the United Kingdom was
used as the backbone to the city's UNESCO City of Music
successful accreditation. Liverpool promotes The Beatles'
music as their local culture harnessing and mobilizing it as a
local resource (Cohen, 2007). In 2015, the Liverpool music
tourism board reported that The Beatles' legacy contributed
about £82 million the local economy ("The Beatles Add £82
Million a Year to Liverpool Economy," 2016). These figures
reflect that The Beatles' music is an expression of the city's
soul (Cohen, 2007) because their music played a role "in the
production of individual, collective and local identify" of
Liverpool (Cohen, 2007, p. 38). This local music identity is
ironic, given the success of the band was first in Hamburg
(Germany) and then in London in the U.K (Cohen, 2007).
However, as U.K musicologist Cohen (2007) contends,
Liverpool is seen as the "fifth Beatle" because the band's
"haunting presence" (p. 168) helped to "re-image the city";
"categorising" "claiming," and "promoting" their music as
the city's "local culture" (p. 5).
Limitations.Limitations of algorithm C are associated with
the fact that the UNESCO's City of Music accreditation pro-
cess does not allow dual rankings. For example, based on its
music heritage alone, an argument could be made that Mel-
bourne fulfills the UNESCO Music City status. However, in
2008, Melbourne was designated the second city after Edin-
burgh to secure a UNESCO City of Literature ranking.
Therefore, Melbourne is unable to apply for the music cities
title. This ruling signifies an artificial divide as there are
"many conflicting meanings clustered" around the term "cul-
ture" and "music" (Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002, p. 2). As
anthropologists and ethnomusicologists (Cook & Eversit,
1999; Carter 2002) note, music is not a distinct activity from
other cultural practices. For example, music is also often
intertwined with literature such as songwriting. One only has
to look at how American singer­songwriter and 1960s folk
legend Bob Dylan "won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature,
marking the first time the prestigious award has been
bestowed upon someone primarily seen as a musician"
(Lane, 2016)). This UNESCO singular ruling has also meant
that another city, Adelaide (South Australia), even though its
music heritage is deemed less significant than Melbourne's,
was able to secure a UNESCO City of Music title in mid-
December 2015 (Fedorowytsch, 2015).
Examining Melbourne, the Music
Capital Using Algorithms A and B
Between 2011 and 2015, seven investigations (Table 6) explore
Melbourne's music scene using Algorithm A (Economics) or
Algorithm B (Four T's creative index), but rarely Algorithm C
(Heritage). Six reports (five from the industry7 and one from
the academic study8) used the four variables associated with
Algorithm A, that is, financial impact (revenue, employment,
audience participation) and the number of venues. The remain-
ing industry report (Harris, 2014) uses the Talent variable of
Algorithm B and focused on the number of singer­songwriters

in each Australian state. The first six investigations reflect the
linkage between "culturalisation" and "economisation" (Pratt,
2009, p. 4), which several economic sociologists oppose
(Hutter & Throsby, 2008; Jackson, 2009; Pratt, 2009, Throsby,
2010)) because of its reductionist view of cultural activity. The
remaining industry report (Harris, 2014) adopted Florida's
(2012, p. 38) "creative class" occupational index, which, as
Pratt (2009, p. 7) argues, fails to capture the wider social reality
of the cultural industries.
The seven investigations differed in scope, methodology,
and exploration of music genres, and therefore yield
different results. In regard to scope, six (2011-2014) were
industry reports with local or state government backing,
while one study was conducted by the academy (University
of Tasmania). Of the six industry reports, three were munici-
pal council reports, two reports focused on Melbourne, and
one report centered on Sydney. The academic study explores
the Australian music landscape. Concerning methodologies,
two industry reports (Economic, Social and Cultural
Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011;
Newton, 2012) use a "mixed methods approach," which is
defined as a combination of quantitative and qualitative data
Baker 7
(Creswell, 2009, p. 2). This approach supports the critical
"cultural turn" (Pratt, 2009, p. 3) in the assessment of the
music industry by favoring interpretive, qualitative method-
ologies (Throsby, 2010). These two reports contend that
Melbourne is the music capital of Australia. The other four
investigations (industry reports and academy study) used an
economically driven quantitative, "reductivist" or "produc-
tivist" (Pratt, 2009, p. 3) approach and suggested that Sydney
is the music capital of Australia. Finally, in relation to music
genres, Table 6 highlights that research about the "music cit-
ies paradigm" (Baker, 2016, p. 334) has not been consistent,
in what musicologists (Cohen, 2007; DeNora, 2000;
Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002) call the definition of music.
Only two (Economic and Cultural Value of Live Music in
Australia, 2015; Harris, 2014) out of the seven investigations
offer a holistic view of the Melbourne music scene because
they include live music and recorded music. These two stud-
ies and the 2014 Size and Scope of the Live Performance
Industry include all music genres from contemporary, pop,
classical, opera, ethnic and world music, and recorded music,
and therefore offered a holistic view of the "music city para-
digm" (Baker, 2016, p. 334).
Melbourne Is the Live Music Capital of Australia
Empirical evidence that Melbourne is the live music capital
of Australia emerged from two reports (Economic, Social
and Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in
Victoria, 2011; Newton, 2012) using Algorithm A
(Economics) and Algorithm B (four T's of creative index).
The other report (Harris, 2014) used the talent variable of
Algorithm B (Talent), based on Australasian Performing
Right Association (APRA) and Australasian Mechanical
Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS) of songwriter location
(Table 7).
National Study (Algorithm B's Talent Index,
Songwriter Location)
Released on December 22, 2014, data from the APRA/
AMCOS report, titled National Songwriter, Postcode
Rankings, 2003-2013, rank Australian cities according to the
residential location of songwriters. Applying the talent vari-
able of Algorithm B, the report found that Melbourne had the
most contemporary songwriters, in the categories of pop,
rock, alternative music, jazz, and classical composers in
Australia. After Melbourne, Sydney had the second largest
number of songwriters (Harris, 2014). Following the release
of the 2014 report, principal APRA/AMCOS analyst Andrew
Harris said the data confirmed that Melbourne was the music
capital of Australia. However, the APRA/AMCOS report
was associated with three limitations. First, other musicians,
who are not songwriters, were not included in this investiga-
tion to validate Harris's claim. Second, individual APRA
registered songwriters have access to various catalogs in
terms of number of songs, commercial release, and income
generation, but this report also did not explore the activity
and success levels among songwriters. Finally, industry
reports, like the APRA and AMCOS one, need to be con-
ducted annually (not ad hoc) to assess the longitudinal trends
and mobility of the Australian music population.
Victorian Study: Algorithm A (Venue Location,
Economic Impact, Financial Profits, Employment,
and Audience Participation) and Algorithm A
(Four T's Creative Index)
The 2012 Victorian Live Music Census9 analyzed the local
music scene according to Algorithm A (Economics) and
Algorithm B (Four T's creative index). In regard to
Algorithm A, the census reports that Melbourne and the
surrounding suburbs had 465 venues that offered live music
at least two nights a week (Newton, 2012). Comparing
these figures with the 2015 World Cities Report (previously
noted) illustrates that Melbourne has the second most live
music venues after the top ranked city, Los Angeles, which
has 510 live music venues (Simons, 2015). These figures
support Connell and Gibson's (2003) argument that
"authenticity" of music scenes is heavily lined to a "live
music" culture (p. 18). Concerning economic impact, the
2012 Census also highlights that the live music scene (ven-
ues, concerts, festivals) generated Aus$1.04 billion annu-
ally (Newton, 2012). The census reports that the local live
music industry generates more than 116,000 full-time jobs
annually (Newton, 2012), which supports Florida's (2002)
argument that the creative class fuels creative employment.
The 2012 Census of the Melbourne music industry also
support Cohen's (2007) claim that music is a vibrant local
resource (Table 6).
Algorithm B's Four T's creative index is reflected in the
census survey results in three ways. First, surveying 258 live
music performers the census found that the majority of per-
formers were APRA members and had at least one commer-
cial recording. This finding reflects Algorithm B's talent
variable. Second, the census reports that musicians promote
their music via the street press or online, for example,
SoundCloud or YouTube (Newton, 2012). This second find-
ing highlights Algorithm B's technology variable. As Florida
(2002) claims, technology supports a creative city. Third, to
measure audience participation and social and cultural
impacts from live music gigs, the census also surveyed 560
music fans (Newton, 2012; Table 7). The census found that
the average music fan was a full-time worker or a university
student, aged in their mid- to late-20s, who listened to rock
music and sourced the music gig guide from the alternative
presssuchascommunityradio(TripleR[RRR],10 Progressive
Broadcasting Service [PBS] 106.7 FM11) or street press
(Beat and Inpress magazines12) (Newton, 2012). This final
finding supports Algorithm B's territorial assets variable
8 SAGE Open
because it highlights that Melbourne music scene was asso-
ciated with a "sense of place," and helped to create a music
"community" and cultural "identity" (Cohen, 2007, p. 38).
Despite having no comparable national or international
empirical evidence, and making use of Algorithms A and B,
in the Victorian census, Newton (2012) claims that
"Melbourne is Australia's centre of popular music live per-
formance" (p. 10).
A precursor to the 2012 Census, the Economic, Social and
Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,
was released in June 2011 and conducted by Deloitte Access
Economics (Table 7). Similar to the 2012 Census, the report
applied Algorithms A and B in its survey analysis but had
fewer respondents (477) than the census (818). In regard to
Algorithm A, the report was associated with three findings.
First, in regard to economic values, it surveyed 103 venues
("the intermediary"), which were registered with APRA such
as hotels, bars, cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs (Economic,
Social and Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music
in Victoria, 2011, p. 4; Table 6). Despite the difference in sur-
vey numbers, the Deloitte report (Economic, Social and
Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria,
2011) and the 2012 Census (Newton, 2012) both agreed that
Melbourne had about 465 venues, which play a crucial role in
developing music careers and incubating talent. Second,
building on the economic impact, the the Deloitte report said
that full-time employment figures increased by about 17,200
staff per year but did not provide original employment figures
prior to that increase. Therefore, it is hard to compare its
employment figures with the 2012 Census, which stated that
the local music industry employed 116,000 full-time persons
per year (Newton, 2012; Table 7). Finally, in relation to finan-
cial profits, and like the census, the report says that the
Melbourne music scene generated more than Aus$1 billion of
great music cities such as Austin in Texas (Rowling, 2015).
In regard to Algorithm B, the 2011 Economic, Social and
Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria
report offers more insightful than the census because it
undercovered three additional findings, which reflect
Florida's (2002) creative index of talent, tolerance, and ter-
ritorial assets. First, in regard to the talent and territorial
assets variables, its survey of fifty-one live music perform-
ers, noted as "the upstream supplier" (p. 3) highlights that
live music venues nurture creativity by providing a space for
musicians to perform original music (p. 26). This finding
reflects what Elbourne (2013) and Connell and Gibson
(2003) say in regards to drawing and keeping musical talent
are critical to any city's music status. As Connell and Gibson
(2003) note, a city with a vibrant live music culture can serve
as a "cultural anchor" for musicians (p. 29). It implies that
Melbourne's live music scene possess territorial assets that
are highly valued by musicians and others migrating to the
city from interstate. Second, extending on the territorial
assets index, the report notes that a nurturing media (com-
munity radio such as RRR and PBS and the street press),
local community cohesion, such as the Save Live Australian
Music (SLAM)13 rally in 2010 helps to protect the live music
industry (Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution of
Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011). Finally, in
regard to the tolerance variable, the report surveyed 427
music fans, called "the downstream consumers" (p. 3) and
found that live music venues provide an opportunity for
music fans to develop "social connectedness" and a "sense of
belonging," particularly among young adults (pp. 38-39).
The report's findings linkage to Algorithm B suggest that
music plays a role "in the production of individual, collective
and local identify" of Melbourne (Cohen, 2007, p. 38).
The two Victorian reports (Economic, Social and Cultural
Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011;
Newton, 2012) suggest that music is an expression of
Melbourne's urban life because it plays a key role "in the
production of individual, collective and local identify" of the
city (Cohen, 2007, p. 2). The reports claim that no city in
Australia matched Melbourne's music activity, depth or
diversity. However, these proclamations are problematic
because they are associated with two key limitations. First,
similar to The Mastering of a Music City (Terrill et al., 2015)
report, the investigations fail to examine all genres of music

and offer national or international comparable figures, by
only focusing on Melbourne's rock and pop music scene
(Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution of Venue-
Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011; Table 7). Second, they
fail to make concrete national or international comparisons.
As Madrid (cited in Garrett & Oja, 2011, p. 700) highlights,
music is affected by the ongoing economic and spatial
restructuring of the industry. However, these investigations
also acknowledge, "The economic, social and cultural con-
tribution of live music in Victoria" is still in need of more
in-depth study (Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution
of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011, p. 36).
Analysis of these two local investigations illustrates that
"music and cities . . . can mean different things to different
people," and are "not impartial to crude generalizations"
(Cohen, 2007, p.68).
Counterclaims to Melbourne's Live Music Capital
Title: Algorithm A (Live Music Activity, Financial
Profits, Employment, and Audience Participation)
Four investigations (one national academic study, 2015; two
national industry reports, 2014 and 2011; and one Sydney
report, 2013) exploring the Australian music landscape are
based on Algorithm A (Economics; Table 8). These reports
suggest that, based on the number of venues (live perfor-
mance activity) and economic impact (financial profits,
employment, and audience participation), New South Wales
(NSW), not Victoria, has the most music activity inAustralia.
The first investigation is a national academic study titled the
Economic and Cultural Value of Live Music in Australia
(2015), which released in August 2015 but based on 2014
figures. It surveyed thirty-eight venues spread across six
states (NSW, Victoria, Queensland [QLD], South Australia,
Western Australia, and Tasmania) and two territories
(Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory), and is
associated with two key findings. First, this 2015 study
reports that NSW's live music scene (revenue, festivals, and
attendance rates) had a marginally greater economic and cul-
tural impact than Victoria (Economic and Cultural Value of
Live Music in Australia, 2015). Second, it notes that NSW
had the highest live music attendance (35.9%) in Australia,
while Victoria was second (31.3%) (Economic and Cultural
Value of Live Music in Australia, 2015, p. 17; Table 8).
The second investigation is a national industry report by
Ernst and Young, titled Size and Scope of the Live
Performance Industry report14. Released in February 2014
and based on 2012 figures, it uncovers two key findings.
First, the reports reveals that NSW has the highest number
(38.4%) of live performance production and attendance
nationally; Victoria was second (27.6%), while QLD (15.5%)
was third (2015; Table 8). Second, it highlights that the music
economic impact was greater than other aligned Australian
industries such as film, television, and digital games.
The third investigation, a city report from 2013 titled Live
Music Matters: Planning for Live Music and Performance in
Sydney, says that "NSW was the largest contributor to the
venue-based live music industry" in Australia because it
accounted for 32% of the nation's music output (p. 7). These
statistics are derived from the fourth (and final) investiga-
tion, a September 2011 report by Ernst and Young titled
Economic Contribution of the Venue-Based Live Music in
Australia, which contends that NSW had the most live music
in Australia (32%), QLD came second (23.6%), while
Victoria was third (22%). While these four investigations
dispute the claim that Melbourne is the music capital of
Australia, they only paint a half picture of the music scene
because they rely on the mathematical flowchart ofAlgorithm
A (Economics). As scholars (Hutter & Throsby, 2008;
Jackson, 2009; Pratt, 2009) argue, the economization of cul-
ture needs to give way to draw on more holistic, social and
cultural interpretative investigation of the music landscape.
Benchmark: Algorithm D (Music Cities
Definition)
Tables 6 to 8 illustrate that there are limitations, missing
gaps, and discrepancies in the three algorithms (A-C) used to
examine music cities. For example, using a variety of quan-
titative and qualitative research methods and applying

Algorithm A (Economics) and Algorithm B (Four T's cre-
ative index), four of the seven investigations examined in
this article suggest that Sydney, not Melbourne, is the music
capital ofAustralia. These discrepancies (and deficits reflect)
the need for a fourth (benchmark) algorithm, such as
Algorithm D (Music Cities definition), is needed to compre-
hensively assess music activity in any urban context (Table
1). Algorithm D has three main components in relation to
methodology, music genres, and scope. First, in regard to
methodology, its outcomes will be based on a "mixed meth-
ods research," that is, a combination of quantitative and qual-
itative data (Creswell, 2009, p. 2). Second, the algorithm
assesses, a key variable, all music genres (live and recorded).
Finally, concerning scope, it synergizes Algorithms A to C's
thirteen variables, ranging from economics (financial impact,
number of venues, and audience participation), Four T's cre-
ative index (technology, tolerance, talent, territorial assets),
and music heritage (background in music-making, educa-
tion, community involvement, regular high-profile music
events of local and international importance) into one con-
glomerate. In total, fourteen variables associated with
Algorithm D offer a more holistic definition of music cities
because of two reasons. First, it emphasizes the importance
"of place (the physical environment through which we move)
and space (the practice and lived experience of place)" (Fink
cited in Garrett & Oja, 2011, p. 709). Second, it illustrates
that music cities are also influenced by "cultures, economics,
politics, and technology of the changing structure and geog-
raphies of music at local and global levels" (Connell &
Gibson, 2003, p. 1).
Conclusion
This article highlights that debates about whether
Melbourne is Australia's music capital remain contestable
because, for example, Algorithms A to C used to assess music
activity only paint a half picture of this "music cities para-
digm" (Baker, 2016, p.334). Given there are many drivers of
organizations commissioning various music investigations,
the article proposes a benchmark Algorithm D to review and
analyze music activity in an urban context. Algorithm D is
based on a mixed methods research approach. This algorithm
is associated with fourteen variables (Table 1) includes all
genres of music and the conglomeration of 13 variables from
AlgorithmsAto C.Algorithm D offer a holistic view of music
cities, because it emphasizes the importance of place and
space in music production across the globe (S. Cohen, 2007;
Connell & Gibson, 2003; Garrett & Oja, 2011). Algorithm D
also builds on an interdisciplinary framework, from economic
sociology, musicology, and urban studies, which is critical to
any discussion of music cities. As economic sociologists
(Hutter &Throsby, 2008; Jackson, 2009; Pratt, 2009;Throsby,
2010) note, culture is a multilayered activity, which is beyond
a price tag. Musicologists (Cohen 2007; DeNora, 2000;
Hesmondhalgh & Negus, 2002, Madrid cited in Garrett &
Oja, 2011) contend that failing to investigate all genres of
music across the globe offers a reductive representation of
music cities' sounds. In the case of Melbourne, if this city
wants to claim its status as the music capital ofAustralia, con-
sistent data mining using fourteen variables, outlined in
Algorithm D, offers a benchmark for further investigation.
Until then, ambient claims that Melbourne is Australia's
music capital remains an abstract notion coined by cultural
groups that have a vested interest in pursuing a policy agenda,
to sell their city as a national and global music city.

Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, 2011).
11. Since 1979, community broadcaster PBS 106.7 FM has been
a key player in Melbourne's diverse music community--with
more than 80 specialist music programs ranging from soul to
garage to country to jazz.
12. Melbourne's independent music scene feed off an equally
vibrant free weekly tabloid-sized music magazine (street
press) such as Beat which began in 1980, and then its local
rival established by former Beat reporters, Inpress magazines.
In August 2013, Inpress and other two magazines of the street
press company, Drum Media and Time Off, were merged under
a new brand, The Music (Bella, 2013).
13. The Save Live Australian Music (SLAM) rally held in
Melbourne's Central Business DDistrict (CBD) on February
23, 2010, reportedly attracted more than 20,000 people and
was considered the largest cultural gathering in Australia
(Homan, 2014). Around 22,000 people signed a SLAM peti-
tion requesting the Victorian Government decouple the link
between live music and high-risk liquor licensing conditions
(Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based
Live Music in Victoria, 2011).
