Abstract
Objectives: A retrospective study to investigate the relationship between epicardial adipose
tissue thickness (EATT) and presence of coronary artery plaque, coronary artery disease (CAD)
and CAD risk factors.
Methods: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography images were
reviewed. Left anterior decending artery, right coronary artery and left circumflex artery
pericoronary EATTwere measured. Demographic, clinical and CAD risk factor data were obtained
from medical records.
Results: Patients with CAD (n ¼ 49) had significantly larger mean EATT than those without CAD
(n ¼ 101). Pericoronary EATTwas significantly correlated with body mass index, total cholesterol
level, coronary artery calcium score, hypertension and diabetes mellitus history.
Conclusions: There is an association between pericoronary EATTand CAD, as well as CAD risk
factors. Pericoronary EATT measurement may become a widely used, easy-to-perform method for
determining CAD risk.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is character-
ized by myocardial ischaemia due to ather-
omatous plaque accumulation in the
coronary arteries and is the primary cause
of adult deaths in developed countries. CAD
is a pathological process; several years can

pass between disease initiation and the
development of myocardial dysfunction.
The worldwide CAD mortality rate is
expected to rise from 28.9% in the 1990s
to an estimated 36.3% in the 2020s.1
Multiple risk factors (including sex, age,
smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
body mass index, family history of CAD
and diabetes mellitus)2,3 are associated with
the prevalence, incidence and progression of
CAD, and the correction of these risk
factors results in a 50% decrease in the
incidence of cardiovascular death.4 The
identification and treatment of plaques ­
before they narrow the coronary artery
lumen or cause acute coronary syndrome ­
can halt and possibly even reverse the pro-
gression of CAD, returning the plaques to a
stable form.1,4­7
Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) fills the
area between the pericardium and the
myocardium, and has the same embryologic
origin as intra-abdominal adipose tissue.8
Regional adiposity is known to play an
important role in the development of car-
diovascular disease.2,9 EAT secretes proin-
flammatory cytokines2,10­13 that have been
shown to play an important role in the
development of CAD. 9­12,14,15
The aim of the present study was to
investigate the relationship between EAT
thickness (EATT) and the presence of cor-
onary artery plaques, CAD and CAD risk
factors.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study included consecu-
tive patients who underwent multidetector
computed tomography (MDCT) coronary
angiography at the Department of
Radiology, School of Medicine, Firat
University, Elazig, Turkey between January
2008 and June 2010. Clinical data, labora-
tory findings, major risk factors for coronary
artery disease and MDCT images were
obtained from patient records. Exclusion
criteria were images of suboptimal quality
and those patients who underwent coronary
interventions such as stent placement or
bypass surgery. Additionally, patients with
congenital heart disease and coronary artery
anomalies were excluded from the study.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of Firat University School of
Medicine, Elazig, Turkey. All patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
MDCT
Examinations were performed with a 64-
detector MDCT (AquilionTM; Toshiba
Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). Patients
were informed about the necessity of hold-
ing their breath and avoiding movement
before the start of the examination, to
shorten the scan duration and ensure patient
compliance. Patients were given 5 mg iso-
sorbide dinitrate (sublingual) 2­4 min before
image acquisition in order to dilate the
coronary arteries. Patients with heart rate
>70 bpm received 5 mg metoprolol tartrate
(intravenous) until their heart rate reached
<70 bpm (maximum dose 10 mg). Upper
and lower scanning limits were determined
by obtaining anteroposterior and lateral
scanograms at the beginning of the examin-
ation. Images without contrast were
obtained for calculating calcium scores.
Heart rate and ECG traces were recorded
retrospectively during scanning, for segmen-
tal reconstruction. A region of interest
(ROI) was placed in the aortic root, and
70 ml nonionic contrast medium
(OmnipaqueÕ 350 mg/ml, Amersham
Health, Cork, Ireland) was administered
via the antecubital vein with an autoinjector
(CT2 injektron MEDTRON, Saarbruecken,
Germany) at a rate of 5­6 ml/s. Data were
collected after 7 s when the ROI reached 100
HU-density. Following the procedure, 30­
40 ml sodium chloride was administered via
the antecubital vein at a rate of 5­6 ml/s.

All MDCT images were transferred to a
workstation running Vitrea 2Õ software
(Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA).
Reconstruction images were created in the
percentile where the least movement
occurred and image evaluations were per-
formed in the region where each of the
coronary arteries had the fewest artefacts.
Coronary artery plaques were classified
morphologically as soft, calcified or mixed.
Arterial narrowing was classified as mild (0­
49%), moderate (50­74%) or severe (75­
99%). Pericoronary EATT was measured at
the thickest region, which extended perpen-
dicular to the heart from the left anterior
decending artery (LAD), right coronary
artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery
(LCX) in the axial images. EATT was not
measured obliquely to the vessel diameter
(Figure 1). All EATT measurements were
made by an experienced radiologist
(A.M.A.)
Study definitions
Coronary artery disease was defined as the
presence of at least one coronary artery
plaque, as determined by MDCT.13,16,17
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood
pressure !140 mmHg, diastolic blood pres-
sure !90 mmHg, or treatment with an
antihypertensive agent. Diabetes mellitus
was defined as fasting plasma glucose
!6.93 mmol/l or treatment with a hypogly-
caemic agent and/or insulin.
Hypercholesterolaemia was defined as total
cholesterol level >5.18 mmol/l, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level
>3.4 mmol/l or use of a cholesterol-lowering
agent. Patients were classified according to
body mass index (BMI) as normal (18.5­
24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25­29.9 kg/m2), or
obese (30­39.9 kg/m2). Agatston's calcium
scoring system was used to evaluate coron-
ary artery calcium levels.18
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n (%)
and analysed using Student's t-test, 2-test
or one-way analysis of variance with post
hoc Tukey's test. Regression analysis was
performed to analyse the level of significance
of risk factors and between-group relation-
ships. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSSÕ version 22.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-
values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study included 150 patients (73 [48.6%]
female/77 [51.3%] male; mean age
49.30 Æ 12.60 years; age range 25­85
years). Clinical and demographic data for
patients stratified according to the presence
or absence of CAD are given in Table 1.
Data regarding the relationship between
mean pericoronary EATT and clinical char-
acteristics are given in Table 2. There were
significant relationships between mean
EATT and calcium score, total cholesterol,
BMI, hypertension and diabetes mellitus
(P < 0.05 for each relationship). There were

circumflex artery, P ¼ 0.038; right coronary
artery, P ¼ 0.002; Table 3). Mean EATT was
also significantly higher in patients with
CAD than those without (P < 0.05; Table 3).
Plaque morphology in each of the three
coronary arteries (LAD, LCX and RCA)
was compared with pericoronary EATT.
Mean pericoronary EAT was significantly
thicker in arteries with calcified plaque than

Discussion
Increasing numbers of coronary risk factors
have been identified and are known to play
important roles in the development and pro-
gression of atherosclerosis.19,20 One such risk
factor is adiponectin, which is a hormone
synthesized in fat cells including those in
epicardial adipose tissue. Adiponectin
decreases insulin resistance and has a protect-
ive role in the formation of atherosclerosis.21
Adiponectin levels have been found to be
lower in epicardial tissue than in subcutane-
ous fat, in patients with CAD.22
Epicardial adipose tissue secretes pro-
and anti-inflammatory mediators that con-
tribute to the formation of CAD. Increased
understanding of the pathophysiological
role of EAT has led to a search for imaging
methods that can provide EATT measure-
ments and detect CAD. An echocardiog-
raphy study found associations between
EATT and risk factors for CAD, such as
BMI, age and C-reactive protein levels, as
well as a correlation between CAD severity
and increased EATT.23 Echocardiography
has also revealed thicker EAT in patients
with metabolic syndrome than in healthy
controls,24 and an association between
thicker EAT and poor prognosis in patients
with acute coronary syndromes.25 A further
echocardiography study found no associ-
ation between CAD severity and EATT,
however.2 The limited echocardiography
window available for the visualization and
measurement of EATT thickness can limit
the efficiency of this technique in determin-
ing the full measurement of fat surrounding
the heart. A study examining the reproduci-
bility of echocardiography EATT findings
identified large interobserver differences
and, as a result, echocardiography was
reported to be of limited use for EATT
measurement.26
Although conventional angiography
is the gold standard for diagnosis of
coronary artery disease, MDCT coronary

angiography has become a useful method
for detecting subclinical atherosclerosis
before the onset of clinical symptoms.27
With the development of 64-detector
MDCT and dual-source technology, non-
invasive CT angiography has become an
alternative to conventional angiography for
CAD diagnosis.3,28 Several studies have
used MDCT to examine the relationship
between epicardial adipose tissue and CAD.
EATT can be measured using MDCT, and
epicardial adipose tissue volume can also be
calculated.12 A study using 64-detector
MDCT found that patients with coronary
artery plaque (with or without stenosis) had
increased EAT volume compared with
patients without coronary artery plaque.29
In addition, EAT volume was a better
predictor of early stage CAD than simple
anthropometric measurements.29 Others
have found relationships between high
EAT volume and the presence of soft or
mixed plaques,30 or CAD.12,31
Although volume measurements
obtained using MDCT provide precise
information about the quantity of EAT,
image processing requires additional soft-
ware and time. The association between
EATT in the left atrioventricular groove
and CAD has been shown to be more
significant than the association between
EAT volume and CAD.8 For convenience,
the present study evaluated EATT.
Pericoronary EAT was significantly thin-
ner in patients with calcium scores of 0
compared with those having scores >0, in
the present study. In addition, pericoronary
EAT was thicker in cases with calcified
plaque compared with those without.
These findings suggest that epicardial adi-
pose tissue could have a role in the

development of calcified plaque in coronary
arteries.
Pericoronary epicardial adipose tissue
has a close anatomical relationship with
the coronary arteries, and may therefore
have a disproportionately large effect on the
inflammatory response and the development
of atherosclerosis. We therefore measured
pericoronary EATT in order to examine the
relationship between epicardial adipose
tissue and coronary heart disease. Few
studies have investigated pericoronary
EATT.32 A large-scale study of 573 healthy
postmenopausal women found positive rela-
tionships between pericoronary EATT and
age, body weight, BMI, waist circumference,
waist-to-hip circumference ratio, smoking
status, blood glucose and low serum high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol concentra-
tions.32 In contrast to the present study,
the study population was made up entirely
of older women, and age and sex are known
risk factors for CAD. We also examined
other CAD risk factors and observed that
pericoronary EAT was significantly thicker
in patients with CAD than in those without.
Positive correlations were found between
pericoronary EATT and total cholesterol,
BMI, coronary artery calcium score, hyper-
tension and diabetes mellitus in the present
study. Although pericoronary EAT was
thicker in patients with high LDL-C, this
correlation was not statistically significant.
Similar findings have been reported by
others,32 and this lack of significance may
be due to the different proportional distri-
bution of other risk factors in our study.
Pericoronary EATT was not correlated with
either cigarette smoking or family history in
the present study, which may also be due to
differences in the distribution of CAD risk
factors.
The present study had several limitations.
EATT measurements were made from the
thickest region around the LAD, LCX and
RCA, but interobserver differences are pos-
sible. In addition, factors, including the low
number of patients and differences in the
distribution of CAD risk factors between
individuals limited the statistical power.
In conclusion, the present study reveals a
relationship between pericoronary EATT
and CAD, as well as an association between
pericoronary EATT and CAD risk factors.
Pericoronary EATT measurement may
become a widely used, easy-to-perform
method for determining CAD risk.
