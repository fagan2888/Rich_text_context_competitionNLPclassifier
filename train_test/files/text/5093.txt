Introduction
Workplace bullying has been examined and researched by
scholars for more than 30 years, and it continues to be an area
of growing academic interest (Hurley, Hutchinson, Bradbury,
& Browne, 2016; Paull & Omari, 2016). Bullying behaviors
entail how an individual torments, undermines, intimidates,
and frightens the person being targeted by dictating terms
through physical, psychological, and emotional domination.
Recognized as a universal menace to the contemporary
working life (Hurley et al., 2016) with devastating effects at
both individual and organizational levels (Einarsen &
Nielsen, 2015; Laschinger & Fida, 2014; Nielsen & Einarsen,
2012; Nielsen, Nielsen, Notelaers, & Einarsen, 2015), iden-
tifying bullying at work requires occurrence of prolonged
and persistent bullying, power imbalance between the parties
with bully perceiving a power deficit in the victim (not nec-
essarily the hierarchical power), and escalation of bully's
behavior from indirect and subtle advances to more aggres-
sive acts ultimately resulting into severe psychological and
physical process (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, & Cooper, 2011).
Scholarly engrossment in bullying has its roots in child-
hood studies (Olweus, 1978) with prime focus on bullying
among tots and teens. In the late 1980s, researchers turned
their attention to adult bullying within the context of work-
place (Leymann, 1990) and since then it became a subject of
extensive research in scholarly fields in the contemporary
organizational research (Petrovic, Cizmic, & Vukelic, 2014)
with the plethora of recent developments and discussions
across a number of countries. Dominated by Western perspec-
tives, literature on workplace bullying is relatively recent and
scanty in Eastern as well as developing countries (Paull &
Omari, 2016), particularly in India (D'Cruz, 2016b). As the

Investigating Workplace Bullying in
India: Psychometric Properties, Validity,
and Cutoff Scores of Negative Acts
Questionnaire­Revised
Richa Gupta1, Arti Bakhshi2, and Ståle Einarsen3
Abstract
Workplace bullying is a universal threat with statistics available at global level prominently suggesting that this phenomenon
is thriving like a pandemic worldwide. Limited literature on workplace bullying from Indian perspective can be attributed to
the paucity of standardized tools for investigating its prevalence. This study reports validation, psychometric properties, and
cutoff scores for Negative Acts Questionnaire­Revised (NAQ-R) in Indian sample (N = 1,053). Confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) revealed a best fit three-factor model of work-related bullying, person-related bullying, and physically intimidating
bullying NAQ-R demonstrated high reliability and validity using CFA and Pearson's correlation with measures of burnout,
work engagement, and perceived victimization. Two cutoff points for NAQ-R were formulated using receiver operating
characteristic curve for categorizing respondents as "never bullied" (scores below 40), "occasionally bullied" (scores between
40 and 56), and "severely bullied" (scores above 56). Based on these scores, 46% of the employees were found being bullied
at work, either occasionally or frequently. NAQ-R is a valid and psychometrically sound measure to examine workplace
bullying in India. Clear cutoff scores may help practitioners in designing prevention and intervention strategies. As NAQ-R
is the most extensively tried and tested measure of workplace bullying worldwide, the findings of the study may facilitate
cross-cultural comparisons.

issues pertaining to measurement of workplace bullying are
of utmost importance (Notelaers & Einarsen, 2013), limited
literature on workplace bullying from Indian perspective may
draw attention toward paucity of a standardized tool to esti-
mate prevalence of workplace bullying in India. A review of
literature affirms that targets usually deny being bullied for
many reasons (Jamieson, Mitchell, Le Fevre, & Perry, 2015)
while reporting extensive exposure to specific acts of work-
place bullying (Nielsen et al., 2009). Underreporting related
to workplace bullying is a matter of concern in India also
(D'Cruz, 2012, 2016a). Considering this issue, an indirect
measure for the investigation of the problem in Indian service
sector is essential. Owing to the sensitivity of the issue and its
aftermath, Paull and Omari (2016) have cautioned to general-
ize findings regarding workplace bullying to different cultural
contexts as the prevalence of workplace bullying has varying
estimates across the world (Einarsen et al., 2011; Nielsen,
Matthiesen, & Einarsen, 2010). On the positive side, under-
standing cultural variations in the identification of workplace
bullying is also important for the effectiveness of preventive
and intervention strategies (D'Cruz, Paull, Omari, & Guneri-
Cangarli, 2016).
Aim of the Study
Addressing the gaps that have evolved in the literature con-
cerning a reliable and valid measure of workplace bullying, to
identify the nature and extent of the problem in India and to
facilitate cross-cultural comparisons across nations using uni-
form standardized measures (D'Cruz & Rayner, 2015;
Nielsen, Notelaers, & Einarsen, 2011; Notelaers & Einarsen,
2013), the present study was aimed at assessment of validity
and psychometric properties including reliability and factor
structure of Negative Acts Questionnaire­Revised (NAQ-R)
in Indian sample. NAQ-R is the most widely tested and exten-
sively used indirect measure of workplace bullying (Giorgi,
Arenas, & Leon-Perez, 2011; Kakoulakis et al., 2015) that has
been used in more than 300 research projects (Notelaers &
Einarsen, 2013) across different sectors with more than
50,000 respondents and over 40 countries worldwide.
Although an internationally acclaimed indirect standardized
measure of workplace bullying (Ciby & Raya, 2015), NAQ-R
has been developed in Norway (Einarsen, Hoel, & Notelaers,
2009) and tested mostly in Western countries.As national cul-
ture is an important determinant of employees' perceptions
regarding bullying behaviors at work (Escartin, Zapf, Arrieta,
& Rodriguez-Carballeira, 2011), assessment of validity and
psychometric properties of NAQ-R is essential before its use
in Indian context. Given the nature of measurement scale
underlying response categories of NAQ-R (Einarsen et al.,
2009), reliability and validity assessment of the same using
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is highly recommended
(Said, Badru, & Shahid, 2011). This study is the first to report
reliability and validity assessment of NAQ-R using CFA
approach. As suggested by Cronbach and Meehl (1955),
construct validity of the questionnaire was also confirmed by
correlating the scores obtained on the measure of NAQ-R
with the scores of respondents on the measures of theoreti-
cally related constructs of bullying such as work engagement
and burnout using Pearson's correlation. Work engagement
refers to the strength of connection people have with their
working environment which may actually buffer individuals
from occupational stressors and its effects (Bakhshi & Gupta,
2016). Burnout has been defined as an extreme form of stress-
related problem for employees (Figueiredo-Ferraz, Gil-
Monte, & Grau-Alberola, 2013). As bullying has also been
considered as a stressor at work (Hauge, Skogstad, &
Einarsen, 2010), constructs of burnout and work engagement
have been chosen for the assessment of convergent and dis-
criminant validity of NAQ-R, respectively. Based on previ-
ous researches (Einarsen, Skogstad, Rorvik, Lande, &
Nielsen, 2016; Laschinger & Fida, 2014), we hypothesized
that NAQ-R would show positive correlations with measures
on burnout and negative correlations with work engagement.
Most of the studies undertaken in different countries have
measured workplace bullying using a single criterion for
identification of targets from nontargets based on an objec-
tive measure (Nielsen et al., 2011), with no scope for assess-
ing variation in the degree of severity of exposure to bullying.
Bullying at work has been defined as an escalating process
(Einarsen et al., 2011), providing cutoff scores for bullying
assessment are, thus, consistent with the theoretical consid-
erations of the construct. Cutoff scores based on receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve are also essential for
evaluating the diagnostic value of a measuring instrument
(Hajian-Tilaki, 2013) to differentiate victims from nonvic-
tims. In India, no such effort has been made earlier to quan-
tify the process of workplace bullying in a broader manner.
Also, with NAQ-R as a universally approved measure of
workplace bullying, providing cutoff scores for NAQ-R
from different cultures would facilitate cross-cultural com-
parisons regarding variations in the prevalence of workplace
bullying. In consideration with this, the present study pro-
vided cutoff scores for NAQ-R to identify victims of work-
place bullying using ROC curve analysis with a self-labeling
measure of victimization that is often used in the area of
workplace bullying (Nielsen et al., 2011) as a criterion refer-
ence. Further relationship between perceived victimization
and exposure to bullying at work on the factors and total
scores of NAQ-R was explored to confirm criterion validity
of NAQ-R and to ascertain negative acts that have been con-
sidered by the targets as typical of workplace bullying.
Workplace Bullying in India
Even though workplace bullying has been identified as an
important issue to consider across the world (Einarsen et al.,
2011), academic literature on workplace bullying in India is
limited as compared with other countries with little substan-
tive data available on the nature, prevalence, and extent of
Gupta et al. 3
workplace bullying in India. Empirical research on work-
place bullying in India has been pioneered by D'Cruz and
Rayner (2013, 2015) to examine the presence of workplace
bullying in Information Technology Enabled Services-
Bussiness Process Outsourcing (ITES-BPO) sector of India
and providing mean score for classification of respondents
on the basis of severity level using the Work Harassment
Scale (Bjorkqvist, Osterman, & Hjelt-Back, 1992). D'Cruz
(2012), the author of the book Workplace Bullying in India,
strongly suggested that workplace bullies do exist in India
and asserted that it is difficult to determine the extent of
workplace bullying due to the dearth of empirical data. Apart
from the ITES-BPO sector, the prevalence of workplace bul-
lying has also been investigated in other sectors, for exam-
ple, among bank employees (Gupta, 2013a), college teachers
(Gupta, 2013b), IT employees (Ciby & Raya, 2014), and
junior doctors (Bairy et al., 2007). Bullying still remains
understudied in India and most employing organizations are
woefully unmindful of its dynamics and consequences as the
phenomenon has not yet gained much academic attention in
India (D'Cruz, 2016b).
The concerning issue of workplace bullying among Indian
workforce has also gained attention in case of several popu-
lar online outlets and more traditional trade publications (see
http://www.citehr.com, http://www.ipetitions.com, and
http://www.womensweb.in). Articles on workplace bullying
reflecting on the nature and frequency of hostility, and mis-
treatment that occurs in Indian workplaces have also been
published in The Times of India, The Hindu, The Indian
Express, and so on. Recently, the subject of workplace bully-
ing in India has also been highlighted in bollywood movies
like Rocket Singh and to some extent in the movie Kartik
Calling Kartik. This suggests that Indian settings are worthy
and in need of concerted attention by researchers with respect
to workplace bullying.
Measuring Workplace Bullying
Since the time of Brodsky's (1976) and Leymann's (1990)
initial formulation of the term harassment, mobbing, or bul-
lying, one of the major concerns has been how to assess the
phenomenon under study. Behavioral (perceived exposure to
bullying behaviors) and subjective (perceived victimization)
measures have been the two most commonly used assess-
ment methods for estimating prevalence of target exposure to
workplace bullying worldwide (Nielsen et al., 2011). The
behavioral experience method investigates exposure to bul-
lying behaviors at work based on the frequency and repeti-
tiveness of exposure to such behaviors within a given time.
Commonly used measures among them include Leymann
Inventory of Psychological Terror (LIPT; Leymann, 1996),
Work Harassment Scale (Bjorkqvist et al., 1992), Workplace
Aggression Research Questionnaire (Harvey & Keashly,
2003), and NAQ-R (Einarsen et al., 2009). The subjective
method provides the respondents with an operational
definition of workplace bullying to which the respondents
are required to indicate whether they acknowledge them-
selves as the entity of being a victim of bullying over a period
of time at work (O'Moore, Lynch, & Daeid, 2003). The self-
labeling approach is more dependent on the respondent's
understanding of the bullying phenomenon and would appear
insufficient in countries where the research is still at infancy
and the concept is less known in general public (Giorgi et al.,
2011). While focus on subjective evaluations and victim's
vulnerability as well as cultural and individual sensitivity
can introduce response bias and prejudice, using an indirect
bullying measure following an operative criterion for inves-
tigating exposure to a range of different negative acts at work
during the last 6 months would avoid priming effects and in
turn facilitate cross-cultural comparisons (Einarsen et al.,
2009; Nielsen et al., 2010; Nielsen et al., 2011).
As underreporting is a serious concern in having true esti-
mates regarding the prevalence of workplace bullying, the
present study relied on NAQ-R, currently the most widely
used indirect measure of workplace bullying, for investigating
its prevalence in India. Each item of NAQ-R describes a typi-
cal bullying behavior that prevails in workplaces with no ref-
erence to the term bullying to preclude "cuing" the respondents
and to avoid possible bias introduced by them like their level
of awareness about the phenomenon or being oversensitive.
Method
Sample
For the present study, multistage sampling was used for
sample selection. In the first stage, population was divided
into six clusters on the basis of zonal map of India such as
east, west, north, south, central, and north east zone. West
and north zones were selected as two clusters out of the six
for sample selection using simple random sampling. In the
next stages, states, districts, and then blocks were selected
from the selected clusters by simple random sampling with-
out replacement (SRSWOR). Because it has been estab-
lished that the problem of workplace bullying is almost 3
times more likely to occur in the health, educational, and
social service sectors than in other occupations (European
Foundation, 2002, as cited in Sloan, Matyok, Schmitz, &
Lester Short, 2010; Van Heugten, 2013), information about
employees working in these organizations and banking sec-
tor located in the selected blocks was procured from the
offices of Registrar General of India; Chief Education
Officer; Director, Health Services; Director, Social Welfare
Department; Director, Statistical and Planning Department,
and so on. Considering the nature of the issue being assessed
and subsequent reluctance of Indian organizations to pro-
vide access to their employees for data collection (D'Cruz,
2012), only those organizations and respondents that
werewilling to participate in the study were chosen for sam-
ple selection by simple random sampling. Also, as
4 SAGE Open
the criterion for claiming an incident as bullying involves
repetitive and regular exposure to such incidents over a
period of time, that is, 6 months (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, &
Cooper, 2003), only those participants were included in the
study who had more than 1 year of working experience in
their present organizations. Thus, the present study explored
the dynamics of workplace bullying in a multi-occupational,
cross sectional randomly selected sample of 1,053 employ-
ees working in various public and private organizations of
India such as education, health, social service, and banking
and insurance sector. Informed consent was obtained from
the participants before collection of data. Out of 1,053
respondents, 52.6% were females and 47.4% were males.
Majority of respondents (35%) were in the age group of 31
to 40 years. In total, 37.4% of respondents were working in
the education sector, 36.9% in health sector, 17.1% in bank-
ing and insurance sector, and 8.6% in social service sector.
Of all, 52.4% of the respondents were serving in govern-
ment organizations while 47.6% in the private. About 54%
of the respondents were working on a temporary contract
and 46% were employed on permanent basis.
Measures
NAQ-R.Exposure to workplace bullying was assessed by
using revised version of NAQ-R (Einarsen et al., 2009). It
consists of 22 items with responses on a 5-point scale rang-
ing between specific temporal indicators: never, now and
then, monthly, weekly, and daily. NAQ-R measures expo-
sure to workplace bullying in terms of three factors, namely,
work-related bullying, person-related bullying, and physi-
cally intimidating bullying (Einarsen et al., 2009). Work-
related bullying entails negative behaviors that are directed
at the target's professional role and his or her ability to carry
out work proficiently. Person-related bullying includes nega-
tive behaviors that are predominantly demeaning for the tar-
get personally whereas physically intimidating bullying
enlists aggressive and negative behaviors of a more physical
nature (Notelaers & Einarsen, 2013). The 23rd self-labeling
item provides the respondent with a formal definition of
workplace bullying (Einarsen et al., 2011) on a five-point
response category such as no; yes, but rarely; yes, now and
then; yes, once a week; and yes, several times a week. This is
a measure of perceived victimization in relation to workplace
bullying (Notelaers & Einarsen, 2013).
UtrechtWork Engagement Scale­9 (UWES-9). UWES consist-
ing nine items was used in the study to measure work engage-
ment in terms of vigor, dedication, and absorption with one's
job. The scale has acceptable psychometric properties
(Schaufeli, Bakker, & Salanova, 2006). A total score for
work engagement is computed with the mean score ranging
from 0 to 6. Higher scores on the scale indicate higher
engagement of employees at work. Reliability of the scale
for the present sample was found out to be .84.
Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI).Burnout was measured
with the CBI (Kristensen, Borritz, Villadsen, & Christensen,
2005). The CBI centers on exhaustion and is divided into
three scales. Personal Burnout enlists six items on general
symptoms of physical or psychological exhaustion. Work-
Related Burnout involves seven items on symptoms of
exhaustion related to one's work. Client-Related Burnout
consists of six items on symptoms of exhaustion related to
working with recipients or clients. All three subscales can be
subtotaled into a score of 0 to 100 and averaged into a total
score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher
level of burnout. For the present sample, reliability of three
scales ranges from .78 to .86.
Results
CFA
Amos 18 (Arbuckle, 2009) was used to conduct CFA for
model evaluation. Based on NAQ-R literature (Einarsen
et al., 2009; Einarsen et al., 2011; Giorgi et al., 2011;
Vukelic, Cizmic, Petrovic, Tenjovic, & Giorgi, 2015), three
existing bullying models as per NAQ-R, that is, one-factor
model of workplace bullying, two-factor model of work-
related (Items 1, 3, 14, 16, 18, 19, and 21) and person-related
bullying (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20,
and 22), and three-factor model of work-related, person-
related, and physically intimidating bullying (Items 8, 9, and
22), were tested. The determination of model fit was based
on a comparison of the robust versions of absolute fit indi-
ces such as chi-square statistics and the associated degrees
of freedom, the comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of
fit index (GFI), the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), the root mean square residual (RMR), and incre-
mental fit index such as the Tucker­Lewis index (TLI). The
suggested cutoff values frequently mentioned in the litera-
ture indicating a good fit to the data include CFI and TLI 
.95, RMSEA< .06, and RMR < .08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
A value of 2/df ratio in the range of 2 to 5 demonstrates
an acceptable fit between the hypothetical model and
the observed sample data (Schumacker & Lomax, 2004;
Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). While reporting of chi-square
value and the relative degrees of freedom is highly recom-
mended (Savalei, 2008), other approximate fit indices are
among the most popular alternate measures of fitness in
structural equation modeling literature, and their use as a set
provides unique information for model assessment (Chan,
Lee, Lee, Kubota, & Allen, 2007; Kline, 2011).
Preliminary CFA Findings
A summary of the measurement model findings based on the
CFAs of three competing models of NAQ-R is presented in
Table 1. Cutoff values recommended by Hu and Bentler
(1999) were adopted for these fit indices. In the present
Gupta et al. 5
case, values of CFI/TLI indicated poor fit for single-factor
model while marginal fit for two-factor and three-factor
models. Other fit indices including 2/df, RMSEA, and
RMR failed to exceed the minimum threshold for fit (Table
1), indicating that the three models exhibited "poor" fit in
the present sample. Thus, the three hypothesized models of
NAQ-R did not adequately describe the sample data, sug-
gesting examination of modification indices to identify
potentially useful revisions to a measurement model for
improving model fitness (Furr, 2011).
As mentioned earlier, NAQ-R has been developed and
tested in a different context from India; therefore, cultural
variations in the nature and understanding of the phenome-
non being assessed by NAQ-R are inevitable (D'Cruz et al.,
2016). While the modification indices give diagnostic infor-
mation regarding problem areas of fit within a given model,
model revisions based on modification indices were not
attempted further as such revisions would have been incon-
sistent with the theoretical foundations of CFA and are gen-
erally not recommended unless supported by other residual
diagnostics (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). A better
approach recommended is exploratory factor analysis (EFA;
Hoyle, 2000). Thus, due to the inconsistent CFA results (e.g.,
the failure to exhibit "good" fit for the three competing mod-
els) and the lack of evidence based on Indian data for the
tenability of the factor structure of workplace bullying as per
NAQ-R, an EFA was performed to further review the factor
structure of NAQ-R and to determine whether an alternative
model would yield better fit.
EFA
To ensure the appropriateness of the data for EFA, both the
Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy
and Bartlett's test of sphericity were conducted. The value of
KMO was 0.974, exceeding the recommended level of 0.60
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). In addition, the Bartlett's test of
sphericity showed statistical significance (2, 231 =
22,321.36, p < .01), suggesting that the data were adequate
for EFA. The 22 items of NAQ-R were subjected to maxi-
mum likelihood estimation method with oblique rotation, as
the resultant factors were expected to be correlated (Einarsen
et al., 2009). Using eigenvalues of greater than 1.0 (Kaiser,
1960) and Cattell's (1966) scree test as guidelines for factor
extraction, a final three-factor model emerged explaining
69.72% of the total variance. All the items were retained as
each had factor loadings above .5 (Hair et al., 2010), with no
cross-loadings in excess of .40. As shown in Table 2, all
items loaded on the intended factor except for Item 2, which
was loaded on the factor of person-related bullying. Overall,
the current findings are in line with existing literature regard-
ing factor structure of NAQ-R.
Final Model CFA Summary
After exploring the factor structure of NAQ-R in the present
sample, three CFAs were run to examine the model fitness of
the modified models of NAQ-R (single-factor, two-factor,
and three-factor measurements) consistent with EFA find-
ings. Table 3 depicts the approximate fit indices for the three
competing models. Noteworthy is that only the one-factor
model exhibited a poor fit while both the two-factor and
three-factor models had excellent fit on the basis of fit indi-
ces such as CFI, TLI, GFI, RMR, and RMSEA providing
support for Item 2 (Being humiliated or ridiculed in connec-
tion with your work) as an indicator of work-related bullying
instead of person-related bullying. On comparing the two
nested models of two-factor and three-factor structures, the
chi-square difference test also showed that the three-factor
model fits the present sample significantly better than the
two-factor model, 2(1, N = 1053) = 453.00, p < .01. Hence,
the three-factor model is considered to provide the best fit to
the data compared with the two-factor model on the basis of
significant chi-square difference test (Pratt, 2014).
Reliability and Validity
Table 4 shows values of reliability and validity estimates
based on the present sample. Reliability estimates were
assessed for all the three factors. To ensure the internal con-
sistency, Cronbach's alpha has been used as it is the determi-
nant of the reliability of the construct (Cronbach, 1951). All
the constructs achieved excellent internal consistency
exceeding the conventional cutoff value of .70 (Hair et al.,
2010). Composite construct reliability was also assessed
with calculated values ranging from .91 to .97 against the
recommendedlevelof.70(Bagozzi&Yi,1988).Furthermore,
the AVEs (average variances extracted) of all constructs are
well above the suggested value of .50, implying more than
half of the variances in the respective constructs are explained
by their corresponding measures (Fornell & Larcker, 1981;
Hair et al., 2010). Thus, the acceptable values of Cronbach's
alpha, composite reliability, and AVEs provide support for
the convergent validity of NAQ-R for Indian sample using
CFA (Hair et al., 2010). Following the same approach, dis-
criminant validity has been established by comparing AVEs
of each construct with squared correlation of the paired con-
structs (Table 4). The AVEs for all constructs are greater than
squared correlation thereby supporting discriminant validity,

denoting each construct shares more variance with its own
measures than it shares with other constructs (Fornell &
Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2010).
Furthermore, discriminant and convergent validity were
also confirmed through the method of Pearson product­
moment correlation. Respondents' scores for workplace bul-
lying on the measure of NAQ-R were correlated with the
scores of burnout and work engagement on the scales of CBI
and UWES-9, respectively. A significant positive relation-
ship was found between three factors of workplace bullying
and dimensions of burnout such as work-related burnout,
personal burnout, and client-related burnout, while a signifi-
cant negative relationship was observed between workplace
bullying factors and work engagement (Table 5). The results
were in tune with previous findings corroborating correlates
of workplace bullying as hypothesized earlier, thus demon-
strating construct validity of NAQ-R for measuring work-
place bullying in terms of its nomological networks (Hair
et al., 2010; Murphy & Davidshofer, 2005).
ROC Analysis
Data were subjected to ROC curve analysis for the determina-
tion of cutoff points in relation to exposure to bullying at work.
ROC analysis calculates cutoff scores using Youden's index
based on the linear combination of sensitivity and specificity
(Cutoff = Specificity + Sensitivity; Youden, 1950). Based on
Notelaers and Einarsen's (2013) study, one low (now and
then) and one high (weekly) cutoff point as per self-labeling

item were used as standard reference for defining the lower
and upper thresholds for NAQ-R scores to differentiate occa-
sional and severe exposures to bullying at work. The AUC
(area under the curve) for both the thresholds ranges between
.86 and .96 (p < .01) which shows the diagnostic accuracy of
the test (Streiner & Cairney, 2007), with the optimal cutoff
scores at both lower and upper threshold calculated as 40
(threshold for occasionally bullied) and 56 (threshold for
severely bullied), respectively. As the overall score on the
scale of NAQ-R ranges from 22 to 110, the results of this study
may be helpful for categorizing respondents on the basis of
frequency of their exposure to bullying at work. Employees
with scores below 40 are not bullied, employees with scores
between 40 and 56 are occasionally bullied, and employees
with scores above 56 are severely bullied at work.
Based on the cutoff scores calculated, the results of the
present study revealed that out of 1,053 employees, about
27% (287) reported being occasionally bullied at work, 54%
(563) as never bullied, and 19% (203) as severely bullied.
Overall, around 46% of the employees were found to be
exposed to bullying at workplaces in India either occasion-
ally or frequently. The resulting scores on indirect behavioral
items correspond to the subjective labeling approach applied.
Ahighly significant and positive relationship of scores on the
single item of subjective victimization was found with total
scores of respondents on NAQ-R behavioral items (r = .74, p
< .01) as well as with the three obtained factors of work-
related (r = .62, p < .01), person-related (r = .71, p < .01), and
physically intimidating bullying (r = .48, p < .01).
Discussion
Drawing upon the need for systematic research on workplace
bullying in India (D'Cruz, 2012), the present study assessed
the psychometric properties of NAQ-R in Indian sample to
investigate the prevalence of employees' exposure to work-
place bullying and to provide evidence on its validity.
Findings of the study revealed that workplace bullying is
quite rampant in India as nearly half of the employees
claimed of being exposed to bullying at work either occa-
sionally or frequently. Although the prevalence rate is high
as compared with other countries (Nielsen et al., 2011;
Parent-Thirion, Fernandez-Macias, Hurley, & Vermeylen,
2007), it corresponds to the previous findings with regard to
estimation of exposure to workplace bullying in India
(D'Cruz & Rayner, 2015). With the emergence of cut throat
competition in Indian service sector (Singh, Vohra, &
Sharma, 2015), the high prevalence rate of bullying in Indian
workplaces becomes evident as workplace bullying has been
labeled as a form of discrimination at work on the basis of
competence (Jones, 2006). The most frequent bullying
behaviors that employees experience in Indian workplaces
include assigning unmanageable workload, giving task
below one's level of competence, excessive monitoring of
one's work, and opinions and views being ignored, while the
least experienced behaviors include threats of physical vio-
lence and abuse or actual abuse. Furthermore, three models
of workplace bullying as per NAQ-R were tested with none
having acceptable fit in Indian sample. EFA results of the
present study were inconsistent with the previous studies as
Item 2 (Being humiliated or ridiculed in connection with
your work) has been found to be an indicator of factor named
work-related bullying instead of person-related bullying. In
view of differences regarding conceptualizations of work-
place bullying across countries (Di Martino, Hoel, & Cooper,
2003), with national culture as an important determinant of
employees'perceptions regarding bullying behaviors at work
(Escartin et al., 2011), the contrasting results may be attrib-
uted to cultural variation (Giorgi et al., 2011). As any nega-
tive behavior directed toward one's professional role
becomes an indicator of work-related bullying (Notelaers &
Einarsen, 2013), it can be argued that culture may influence
the perception of behaviors (e.g., humiliation or insult)
occurring in association with one's work to be perceived as
targeted at one's professional role. Moreover, the findings
may be justified with respect to perpetrators of bullying at
both work and personal levels as humiliating or insulting
someone in relation to his or her work may require knowl-
edge about one's work with which everyone in the workplace
may not be aware of while bullying at personal level does not
demand knowledge of victim's work.
The revised three-factor model of NAQ-R (with Item 2 as
a part of work-related bullying) provided the best fit for its
use in India, though the two-factor model of work-related
and personal-related bullying also had acceptable fit. As the
incidents of physical aggression in workplace are very rare
(Neuman & Baron, 1998) and physically intimidating bully-
ing is less acceptable than other forms of bullying on a global
level and within each culture (Power et al., 2013), these find-
ings are in agreement with the previous studies supporting
the three-factor model of NAQ-R (Vukelic et al., 2015). The
results showed that NAQ-R has high internal consistency,
composite reliability, and construct validity for the present
sample. Significant positive and negative relationship of
workplace bullying with burnout and work engagement,
respectively, entails that bullied employees are less likely to

get connected to their work and more likely to get emotion-
ally and physically exhausted.
Two cutoff scores for lower and higher thresholds for
NAQ-R have been calculated for categorizing victims as per
the severity of bullying behaviors experienced by them. The
only study undertaken in this regard by Notelaers and
Einarsen (2013) provided cutoff scores as 33 and 45 for
occasional and severe exposure to workplace bullying,
respectively, based on Norwegian sample. As the cutoff
scores have been derived with subjective victimization as a
standard criterion, the results point out that Indian workforce
is less likely to label its negative experiences at work as per-
sonally threatening or indicator of bullying as compared with
their European counterparts. The findings may again reflect
upon cultural differences as people from collectivistic cul-
ture endorse a robust general belief in just world leading to
development of psychological resilience (Wu et al., 2011)
that make them less likely to appraise the given situation as
threatening or stressful (McElroy, Wintemberg, Cronk, &
Everett, 2016).
Perceived victimization has a significant and positive
relationship with total NAQ-R scores as well as with all the
three factors of workplace bullying. Such finding provides
additional support for NAQ-R as a valid measure for work-
place bullying in Indian context. The strength of relationship
between perceived bullying victimization at work and physi-
cally intimidating bullying has not been as strong as com-
pared with the other two factors. The findings suggest that in
India, bullying at work is conceptualized more in terms of
psychological violence rather than a form of physical vio-
lence. This corresponds to the view held by World Health
Organization regarding nature of workplace bullying (as
cited in Kakoulakis et al., 2015).
General Implications
Recognized as a concerning issue internationally (Giorgi,
2012) with varying estimates all over the world (Hershcovis,
Reich, & Niven, 2015), workplace bullying needs to be
understood in context to Indian perspective (D'Cruz, 2016b)
thereby bridging the gap in the professional knowledge base.
Despite the fact that prevalence of workplace bullying is
quite rife in India, the issue is either not reported or is under-
reported (D'Cruz, 2012). The factors behind this inhibition
to report the matter may include fear of negative conse-
quences comprising negative evaluation, marring of future
job prospects, apprehensions on getting a fair deal in absence
of concrete laws, and so on. To cope up with such a tendency
of victims, an indirect measure to assess bullying behaviors
at work becomes essential. As survey length is generally an
issue in most organizational studies (Nielsen, Hystad, & Eid,
2016), the NAQ-R with a total of 22 short and fairly compre-
hensible items, appears to be an easy-to-apply measure of
workplace bullying. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are
no publications about its validation in India, either in its
complete format or in the reduced version. Since NAQ-R is
the most extensively used instrument for measuring work-
place bullying (Dussault & Frenette, 2014), the findings of
this study would add to the given pool of research on work-
place bullying and would also facilitate international com-
parisons regarding prevalence rate of workplace bullying
across the globe.
Practical Implications
The findings of the study may be beneficial for clinical prac-
titioners as lack of awareness about workplace bullying in
Indian context may unfortunately lead them to misdiagnose
the target of bullying which further makes the target feel vic-
timized a second time (Liu, 2012). It is further averred that
providing the clinicians with robust knowledge about bully-
ing in the workplace, other interpretations are possible (Liu,
2012).As exposure to workplace bullying is a more crippling
and devastating problem for employees than all other kinds
of work-related stresses put together (Hogh, Mikkelsen, &
Hansen, 2011), Nielsen, Tvedt and Matthiesen (2013)
emphasized that the prevention of stress-related health prob-
lems is not possible without adequate information about spe-
cific stress-related factors that are associated with health
problems in different occupational groups.
Although there exist laws for protection against sexual and
workplace harassment, currently there is no legislation in
India that specifically deals with bullying in the workplace
(D'Cruz & Rayner, 2013), even though bullying is ranked on
the top among all forms of stressors present at work (Giorgi
et al., 2016; Wilson, 1991) and is believed to be 3 times more
prevalent than sexual harassment (Namie, 2003). The need of
the hour is to raise awareness about the nature and prevalence
of the issue which seems to be less likely in the absence of a
standardized measure to investigate the phenomenon. As ini-
tiatives and endeavors to manage workplace bullying start
with the identification of the phenomenon and its targets with
an understanding of how frequently it occurs (Caponecchia &
Wyatt, 2011; Notelaers, 2011), reliable and valid measures to
examine workplace bullying are fundamental for the develop-
ment and implementation of effective intervention strategies
to prevent workplace bullying (Schat, Frone, & Kelloway,
2006). This study may be helpful to HRs, social workers as
well as law and policy makers to realize that this issue needs
to be identified and arrested by taking stern and immediate
actions in the direction. Also governments and organizations
are dependent on correct estimates of bullying to know how
much time and resources are needed to handle the problem
(Nielsen et al., 2010). Moreover, primary, secondary, and ter-
tiary prevention and interventions are often encouraged or
initiated on the basis of employees'cutoff scores on measure-
ment instruments used in organizational surveys (Notelaers &
Einarsen, 2013). Providing correct estimates about the extent
of workplace bullying in India would be substantial for gov-
ernment agencies, organizations, and employers to check the
Gupta et al. 9
rise of workplace bullying in Indian workplaces. Needless to
add that containing workplace bullying to a certain level will
ensure stress-free destinations as far as workplaces are con-
cerned. Obviously, anticipating scope, newer ventures, and
most importantly overall well-being and happiness is irrefut-
ably the aim of any study being conducted worldwide.
Although much has to be done to quench the desire of stress-
free workplaces, the research and findings of the present
study regarding the validation of NAQ-R are a beginning
toward a consistent and valid measurement of workplace bul-
lying in India. Considering the parameters and consistency,
the endorsement of the study is justifiable to a large extent.
Limitations and Future
Recommendations
Given the reluctance of Indian organizations to provide
access to their employees owing to the nature of the research
problem (D'Cruz, 2012), the sample size is relatively small
as compared with other studies of similar nature undertaken
in different countries (see Einarsen et al., 2009; Nielsen
et al., 2009). Larger sample size would have provided larger
statistical powers in the estimations. The present study inves-
tigated the prevalence of workplace bullying on the basis of
respondents' own experiences of frequency of exposure to
such behaviors that are not verified by other sources. In
future, qualitative and longitudinal studies can be undertaken
to gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon.
Acknowledging the nature and extent of the problem, this
area, if ignored, can crop up serious repercussions and needs
to be further explored with the prime focus on the underlying
factors that mediate or moderate the effects of workplace
bullying on victims so that effective intervention strategies
can be worked out.
Conclusion
Workplace bullying is a part of employee's experiences in
Indian service sector. Suggestions from previous studies that
have inspired this investigation focus on the need to develop
a reliable and valid measure of workplace bullying in coun-
tries where limited knowledge about phenomenon of work-
place bullying exists (Giorgi et al., 2011). The present study
provides preliminary support for NAQ-R as a reliable and
valid measure to assess workplace bullying in India on the
dimensions of work-related, person-related, and physically
intimidating bullying. The study may have important impli-
cations for future research and practice related to workplace
bullying in India. Considering the high-rate exposure and
quantum of negative effects brewing up among Indian
employees and establishments due to workplace bullying
(D'Cruz & Rayner, 2015; Gupta & Bakhshi, 2017), empiri-
cal use of NAQ-R has attained a significant relevance, thus
becoming a necessity in Indian arena.
