OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the major changes in diet and physical activity patterns around the world and focuses on shifts
in obesity.
DESIGN: Review of results focusing on large-scale surveys and nationally representative studies of diet, activity, and obesity
among adults and children.
SUBJECTS: Youth and adults from a range of countries around the world.
MEASUREMENTS: The International Obesity Task Force guidelines for defining overweight and obesity are used for youth and
the body mass index Z25 kg/m2 and 30 cutoffs are used, respectively, for adults.
RESULTS: The nutrition transition patterns are examined from the time period termed the receding famine pattern to one
dominated by nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases (NR-NCDs). The speed of dietary and activity pattern shifts is great,
particularly in the developing world, resulting in major shifts in obesity on a worldwide basis. Data limitations force us to
examine data on obesity trends in adults to provide a broader sense of changes in obesity over time, and then to examine the
relatively fewer studies on youth. Specifically, this work provides a sense of change both in the United States, Europe, and the
lower- and middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.
CONCLUSION: The paper shows that changes are occurring at great speed and at earlier stages of the economic and social
development of each country. The burden of obesity is shifting towards the poor.

Introduction
Over the past 15 y, there has been increasing evidence that
the structure of dietary intakes and the prevalence of obesity
around the developing world have been changing at an
increasingly rapid pace.1 In many ways, these shifts are a
continuation of large-scale changes that have occurred
repeatedly over time; however, we will assert and show that
the changes facing low- and moderate-income countries
appear to be very rapid. While initially these shifts were felt
to be limited to higher-income urban populations, it is
increasingly clear that these are much broader trends
affecting all segments of society.
Two historic processes of change occur simultaneously
with, or precede, the `nutrition transition'. One is the
demographic transitionFthe shift from a pattern of high
fertility and mortality to one of low fertility and mortality
(typical of modern industrialized countries). The second is
the epidemiological transition, first described by Omran:2
the shift from a pattern of high prevalence of infectious
diseaseFassociated with malnutrition, periodic famine, and
poor environmental sanitationFto one of high prevalence
of chronic and degenerative diseaseFassociated with urban­
industrial lifestyles.3
The nutrition transition is closely related to the demo-
graphic and epidemiologic transitions. Large shifts have
occurred in diet and in physical activity patterns, particularly
in the last one or two decades of the 20th century. Modern
societies seem to be converging on a diet high in saturated
fats, sugar, and refined foods but low in fiberFoften termed
the `Western diet'Fand on lifestyles characterized by lower
levels of activity. These changes are reflected in nutritional
outcomes, such as changes in average stature, body composi-
tion, and morbidity.

The last three stages of the nutrition transition are
described in more detail in Figure 1. In Stage 3, famine
begins to recede as income rises. In Stage 4, changes in diet
and activity pattern lead to the emergence of new disease
problems and increased disability. In Stage 5, behavioral
change begins to reverse the negative tendencies and make
possible a process of `successful aging'.4,5 The changes are all
driven by a range of factors, including urbanization,
economic growth, technical change, and culture. For con-
venience, the patterns can be thought of as historical
developments; however, `earlier' patterns are not restricted
to the periods in which they first arose, but continue to
characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic (SES)
subpopulations. Elsewhere we have laid out the full set of
nutrition transition stages in more detail.6,7
On a global basis, there are several themes related to
obesity that we will summarize. The first is the general shift
toward obesity that represents a global problem rather than
one centered in a few high-income countries. The second is
the rapid increase in obesity found in lower- and middle-
income developing countriesFa rate of change that appears
to be greater than that found in higher-income countries.
The third is the shift in the burden of obesity toward the
poor on a worldwide basis. We present the limited compar-
able data on trends in adolescent obesity across the globe,
with specific attention to the link between obesity and
economic and social development.
Dietary changes around the world are rapid!
The diets of the developing world are shifting rapidly,
particularly with respect to fat, caloric sweeteners, and
animal source foods (ASF).1,8
Edible oil
Elsewhere we have provided evidence of the rapid increases
in edible oil at the national and household level throughout
the developing world. In many developing countries,
dietary change has begun with major increases in
domestic production and imports of oilseeds and vegetable
oilsFrather than animal source products or caloric sweet-
eners. For instance, between 1991 and 1996/7, global
production of vegetable fats and oils rose from 60 to 71
million metric tons.9 In contrast, the production of visible
animal fats (butter and tallow) has remained steady at
approximately 12 million metric tons. Principal vegetable
oils include soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, palm, and ground-
nut oil. With the exception of groundnut oil, global
availability of each has approximately tripled between 1961
and 1990. While the broader macroeconomic shifts that
affected this increase in edible vegetable fat intakeFnamely,
edible vegetable fat prices, supply, and consumptionFis
unique because it affected rich and poor countries equally,
the net impact is relatively much greater on low-income
countries.10,11
Caloric sweeteners
Sugar is the world's predominant sweetener. It is not
clear exactly when sugar became the world's principal
sweetenerFmost likely in the 17th or 18th centuryFas
the New World began producing large quantities of sugar
at reduced prices.12,13 We use the term caloric sweetener
instead of added sugar, as there is such a range of nonsugar
products used today. High-fructose corn syrup is a
prime example, as it is the sweetener used in all US soft
drinks. The name `sweeteners' includes products used for
Urbanization, economic growth, technological changes for work, leisure,

sweetening derived either from sugar crops, cereals, fruits,
milk, or produced by insects. This category includes a wide
variety of monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) and
disaccharides (sucrose and saccharose), which exist either
in a crystallized state as sugar or in thick liquid form as
syrups. Included in sweeteners are maple sugar and syrups,
caramel, golden syrup, artificial and natural honey, maltose,
glucose, dextrose, glucose (also known as high-fructose corn
syrup), other types of fructose, sugar confectionery, and
lactose.
In the last several decades, increasingly larger quantities
of cereals (primarily maize) have been used to produce
sweeteners derived from starch. The overall trends show
a large increase in caloric sweetener consumed.14 In 2000,
306 kcal were consumed per person per day, about a third
more than in 1962; caloric sweeteners also accounted for a
larger share of both total energy and total carbohydrates
consumed. Not surprisingly, we have shown that all
measures of caloric sweetener increase significantly as gross
national product (GNP) per capita of the country and
urbanization increase. However, the interaction between
income growth and urbanization is important. Figure 2
shows the relationship between the proportion of energy
from different food sources and GNP, for two different
levels of urbanization; see Drewnoswski and Popkin10
for a description of the analysis. In the less urbanized
case (panel A), the share of sweeteners increases sharply
with income, from about 5% to about 15%. In the more
urbanized case (panel B), the share (over 15%) is much
higher at lower income and decreases with income. The
analysis confirms previous observations that diets of people
living in urban areas are distinct from those of their rural
counterparts.15
Animal source foods
The revolution in ASF refers to the increase in demand and
production of meat, fish, and milk in low-income develop-
ing countries. Delgado at International Food Policy Research
Institutes (IFPRIs) has studied this issue extensively in a
number of seminal reports and papers16,17 Most of the
world's growth in production and consumption of these
foods comes from the developing countries; thus, develop-
ing countries will produce 63% of meat and 50% of milk in
2020. It is a global food activity, transforming the grain
markets for animal feed. It also leads to resource degradation,
rapid increases in feed grain imports, rapid concentration of
production and consumption, and social change.
China provides an example of the shift in intake of ASF.
The results are presented in depth elsewhere.8 In the past
50 y, using the per capita data from the nationally represen-
tative household survey series in China, we find that annual
consumption of animal foods more than tripledFfrom a
very low-level consumption of 11 kg per capita in 1952 to
38 kg per capita in 1992.8 There was a slow rate of increase
prior to 1979, but thereafter, the rate of increase was much
higher. From 1952 to 1979, intake increased only by 5.6 kg
(0.2 kg annually), while it increased by 21 kg (1.6 kg
annually) between 1979 and 1992. Of the subcomponents,
meat and meat products increased from 8.4 to 20.3 kg,
poultry and games from 0.6 to 2.3 kg, fish from 3.2 to 7.3 kg,
and eggs from 2.0 to 7.8 kg per capita, per year. Urban
residents' intake of ASF increased to 65.3 kg per capita in
1999.
Using in-depth individual intake data from the China
Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we get a clear picture
of the shift in actual daily dietary intake toward increased
animal foods. Urban residents' intake of animal foods per

capita, per day in 1997 was higher than rural residents
(178.2 g for urban vs 116.7 g for rural), and also showed a
larger increase (46.7 g vs 36.8 g) from 1989 to 1997. The
amount and growth of intake of animal foods was positively
associated with income levels. Intake in the low-income
group was 77.6 g per capita, per day in 1997, an increase of
18.6 g, while it was 123.2 and 19.6 g in the mid-income
group, and 191.7 and 64.8 g per capita, per day for the high-
income group. The intake level and the increase in the high-
income group from 1989 to 1997 were almost three times
that in the low-income group.
The US case as an example of developed country
dynamics
The dietary trends in the United States are more complex
than those found in the developing world. In the United
States, daily caloric intake appears to be increasingFprima-
rily from energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and an increase
in snacks.18­23 More meals are being consumed away from
home18­20,22 and portion sizes offered in restaurants have
increased dramatically.14,18,24 There have been significant
increases in salty snacks, fast foods,18­20 and added caloric
sweeteners.14,25 Fast foods generally are more energy dense,
but lack many critical nutrients,26,27 and might be linked
with obesity.28­33 Fruit and vegetable consumption remains
far below the recommended levels.14,18
Physical activity changes appear to be changing
rapidly!
There are several linked changes in physical activity
occurring jointly. One is a shift away from the high-energy
expenditure activities such as farming, mining, and forestry
towards the service sector. Elsewhere we have shown this
large effect.34 Reduced energy expenditures in the same
occupation are a second change. Other major changes relate
to the modes of transportation and activity patterns during
leisure hours. China again provides interesting illustrations.
Table 1 shows that the proportion of urban adults (male and
female) working in occupations where they participate in
vigorous activity patterns has decreased. In rural areas,
however, there has been a shift for some towards increased
physical activity linked to holding multiple jobs and more
intensive effort. For rural women, there is a shift towards a
larger proportion engaged in more energy-intensive work,
but there are also sections where light effort is increasing. In
contrast, for rural men there is a small decrease in the
proportion engaged in light work effort.
In China, 14% of households acquired a motorized vehicle
between 1989 and 1997. In one study, we showed that the
odds of being obese were 80% higher (Po0.05) in house-
holds for men and women who owned a motorized vehicle
compared to those who did not own a vehicle.35
Television ownership has skyrocketed in China, leading to
greater inactivity during leisure time.11 Among youth in the
United States and Mexico, TV viewing is quite extensive but
it is much lower in China, Russia, and the Philippines. The
average child in the United States today spends more than
3 h a day watching television or playing video games and
another 3 h with other forms of media such as movies and
prerecorded music.36 So far, children in China spend
significantly less time than their US counterparts with such
sedentary media, but if US patterns prevail, we should expect
that Chinese children will spend more time attending to the
media in the future. Similarly, CHNS data for 1997 found
that children aged 6­12 y watched TV at an average of 0.77 h
per day, with slightly lower levels, 0.52 h per day, in children
aged 13­18 y; overall, about 9% reporting watching TV for
two or more hours per day. The overall physical activity
pattern data are more limited among the youth. We have
described physical activity patterns of youth in Russia,
China, and the Philippines in a series of papers. In each
case, we have found that walking to school is a major source
of overall physical activity.37­40 We have also found quite
meaningful differences between countries. For instance, in
the Philippines, youth of all ages are actively engaged in
activities such as cleaning, washing, and other measures of
home production, while in China, children are essentially
excluded from such activities and study much more.40
Obesity patterns and trends
It is important to first present a few key issues related to
adults, allowing us to provide a full picture of obesity in
children, as there is limited data on children available.
Shifts in adult obesity are occurring across the globe
We have shown elsewhere that the current levels of over-
weight in countries as diverse as Mexico, Egypt, and South
Africa are shown to be equal or greater than those in the
United States.7 Moreover, the rate of change in obesity in
lower- and middle-income countries is shown to be much
greater than in higher-income countries; see Popkin7 for an
overview. The survey data sets used are nationally represen-
tative comparable data for a number of countries for current
levels of overweight and obesity prevalence and their rates of
change. Figure 3 (panel A) presents the level of obesity and

overweight in several illustrative countries (Brazil, Mexico,
Egypt and Morocco, South Africa, Thailand, and China).
Most interesting is the fact that many of these countries with
quite high overweight levels are very low-income. Moreover,
it probably surprises many people that the levels of obesity of
several countriesFall with much lower income levels than
the United StatesFare so high.
There is enormous heterogeneity in the patterns, trends,
and timing of obesity among developing countries. Many
countries in Latin America began their transition earlier in
the past century and certainly entered the nutrition-related
noncommunicable disease (NR-NCD) stage of the transition
far earlier than did other regions. However, there is
enormous heterogeneity in countries, such as Haiti, and
subpopulations in Central America are still in the receding
famine period. Moreover, some countries, such as Mexico,
really experienced an accelerated transition in the 1990s.41
The Middle East, North Africa, and Asia appear to have
begun their transition at a much later date as have most
other countries in the developing world except for the
Western Pacific nations.
Changes in the developing world are faster than in
higher-income countries!
Figure 3 (panel B) shows how quickly overweight and obesity
status have emerged as a major public health problem in
some of these countries. Compared with the United States
and European countries, where the annual increase in the
prevalence of overweight and obesity among adult men and
women is about 0.25 for each, the rates of change are very
high in Asia, North Africa, and Latin AmericaFtwo to five
times greater than in the United States.
The burden of obesity has shifted to the poor!
Elsewhere we have shown that a large number of low- and
moderate-income countries already have a greater likelihood
that adults residing in lower-income or lower-educated
households are overweight and obese, relative to adults in
higher-income or higher-educated households.42,43 Both
papers used 37 nationally representative surveys of women
aged 20­50 y. One showed that countries with a GNP per
capita over about $2500 are likely to have a burden of obesity
greater among the poor. Belonging to the lower-SES group
confers strong protection against obesity in low-income
economies, can reduce or increase obesity in lower-middle
income economies and is a systematic risk factor for obesity
in upper-middle income developing economies. A multilevel
logistic modelFincluding an interaction term between the
country's GNP and each woman's SESFindicates that
obesity starts to fuel health inequities in the developing
world when the GNP reaches a value of about US$2500 per
capita. Examples of countries above the US$2500 per capita
income levelFthose upper-middle income developing
economies with higher obesity among the lower-SES groups
include Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, and South Africa.
Child and youth obesity prevalence and trends
A study of adolescent obesity dynamics was undertaken
across four longitudinal studies.44 Nationally representative
data from Brazil (1975 and 1997), Russia (1992 and 1998),
the United States (NHANES I (1971­1974) and NHANES III
(1988­1994)), and nationwide survey data from China (1991
and 1997) were used. Overweight is defined using the sex­
age-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoffs recommended by
the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF).45

Overweight prevalence (Figure 4) has increased in
Brazil (from 4.2 to 14.3%), China (from 6.4 to 7.7%),
and the United States (from 15.4 to 25.6%). In Russia,
overweight prevalence decreased (from 15.6 to 9.0%).
The annual increase rates of overweight prevalence are
0.5% (Brazil), 0.2% (China), À1.1% (Russia), and 0.4%
(United States).
The trends and current prevalence of overweight vary
substantially across the four countries we examined and
seem to show a slower increase in child obesity than the rate
of increase in obesity experienced by adults in these
countries. The burden of nutritional problems is shifting
from energy imbalance deficiency to excess among older
children and adolescents in Brazil and China. These changes
and differences may relate to changes and differences in key
environmental factors across countries. For example, the
GDP tripled in the United States and Brazil, but increased by
greater than 10-fold in China during this time.44 Conversely,
Russia saw a worsening of the economy and a decline in
living standards (eg decline of living standards, including a
decrease of food consumption and production). Over the
past three decades, the percentage of older children and
adolescents who were overweight tripled in Brazil and
almost doubled in the United States. We found that the
overweight prevalence was considerably higher in children
than in adolescents in Russia, Brazil, and China but not in
the United States.44 The far greater proportion of adolescent
overweight prevalence in the United States stands out. It is
possible that this relates partly to our use of the IOTF
reference, but these differences may be far too great to be
explained by the use of this reference.
Similar to adults, the changes in youth obesity in these
four countries vary across levels of household income. Over
the past two decades, the prevalence of overweight in Brazil
increased most quickly in high-SES groups, but in the United
States the increase was greatest in low-SES groups.44 In
addition, the prevalence of overweight was much higher in
urban areas than in rural areas in Russia and the United
States.
Childhood and adolescent obesity patterns across
Europe
A recent comparative study conducted across Europe,
presented in depth in other studies, also utilized the IOTF
cutoff criteria for overweight.45,46 These are not nationally
representative studies, but all use BMIs based on anthropo-
metric measuresFnot self-reported weight and heightFthat
are representative samples of the general population of
either the country or a region of it. Four surveys (those for
Belgium, Croatia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) did not
provide estimates of overweight using the IOTF criteria and
the authors used other methods to estimate the proportion
of the sample that would exceed the IOTF cutoff points. This
study, as well as others, has shown that the prevalence of
obesity has risen dramatically in many countries across
Europe.46,47 Among children (ages 7­11 y), overweight
differs across Europe from France (19%), the United King-
dom (20%), Sweden (18%), and Denmark (15%) in Western
and Northern Europe to Russia (10%) and Poland (18%) in
the Eastern bloc and to Spain (34%), Italy (36%), and Malta
(35%) in Southern Europe.47 Adolescent (14­17 y) over-
weight is similar, with particularly high levels in the United
Kingdom (21%) and Southern Europe (Spain (21%), Greece
(22%), and Cyprus (23%)). Guillame and Lissau47 postulate
many reasons for these variations. For example, the North­
South trend is clearly seen and the lower prevalence in
Central and Eastern Europe occurs in countries whose
economies suffered from recession during the economic
and political transition of the 1990s.

Shifts in age-specific time trends
There are few longitudinal studies that follow different age
groups at the same time using a mixed cohort study. Studies
of both dietary and body composition trends seem to
indicate an increase in rates of change across the world.
This has been found in studies of income and price changes
on the structure of the Chinese diets as well as with obesity
trends in the United States. In China, two studies have
shown that shifts towards intake of higher fat foods and
higher fat diets have accelerated changes in income.48,49 In
each case, longitudinal analysis was used to show a
significant increase in the impact of income on diet.
In a longitudinal study in which over 9000 US young
adults born between 1957 and 1964 were resurveyed 13
times over the span of two decades, it was found that more
than 25% were obese by age 35 y.50 Timing of obesity onset
was highest among black females, moderate in Hispanic
females, and lowest in white females, while among males the
highest onset was seen for Hispanic males. In addition,
McTigue et al50 found a large secular weight trend: people
born in later calendar years tended to have larger age-specific
BMI. In every case in which the same age was sampled for
both birth cohorts, the 1957-born group had a lower mean
BMI than the 1964-born group. The intermediate birth
cohorts had intermediate-range mean BMI values.
United States case studyFinsights into current
dynamics in the higher-income world
Gordon-Larsen et al51 sought to examine patterns of change
in obesity among US white, black, Hispanic, and Asian teens
as they transition from adolescence to young adulthood. At
baseline (1996) obesity prevalence (using IOTF cut points)
was 10.9%. After 5 y, a substantial proportion of the
adolescents nonobese at baseline had become obese (12.7%
incidence) and remained obese (9.4% obesity maintenance),
with a small proportion moving from obese to nonobese
(1.6% reversal). Obesity incidence was especially high among
non-Hispanic black (18.4%) and Hispanic females (15.8%)
relative to white females (12.5%), as was obesity main-
tenance among black (16.1%) and Hispanic (10.9%) females
relative to white females (8.5%). Importantly, these data
represent approximately 15.1 million 13- to 20-y-old US
schoolchildren. Thus, in the 5-y study period more than 1.9
million US adolescents became obese, more than 1.3 million
adolescents remained obese, while only approximately one-
quarter of a million adolescents became nonobese.
Conclusion
We have summarized the profound global shift in obesity.
The high obesity prevalence in adolescents is shown to be
persistent into adulthood with high incidence in the
transition to adulthood. We see from the US case that the
increase in obesity from adolescence to adulthood is
tremendous. Other countries following this trajectory are
likely to see substantial adult obesity and its associated
comorbidities if this trajectory is not curbed.
In addition, current data indicate that the levels of adult
obesity far exceed those of children across all regions of the
world. In addition, it seems that rapid increases in child and
adolescent obesity have emerged in recent years, but they
still do not equal the rate of increase found among adults.
We have briefly summarized some of the broader trends in
diet in the developing and developed world with a focus on
case studies from China and the United States. Underlying
these trends are the major and rapid shifts in diets of the
developing world, particularly with respect to greater intake
of fat, caloric sweeteners, and ASF. In addition, declines in
physical activity in leisure, transportation, and work asso-
ciated with modernization play a substantial role. Greater
amounts of sedentary behavior time associated with the
worldwide use of mass media compound these effects.
