Abstract
Objective: The use of early colonoscopy in the management of acute lower gastrointestinal
bleeding (LGIB) is controversial, with disparate evidence. We aim to formally characterize the
utility of early colonoscopy (within 24 h) in managing acute LGIB.
Design: A systematic literature search to August 2016 identified fully published and
abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing early
colonoscopy in acute LGIB. Single-arm studies were also included to define incidence.
Primary outcomes were overall rebleeding rates and time to rebleeding. Secondary
outcomes included mortality, surgery, length of stay (LOS), definite cause of bleeding
and adverse events (AEs). Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were
calculated.
Results: Of 897 citations, 10 single-arm, 9 observational studies, and 2 RCTS were included
(25,781 patients). Rebleeding was no different between patients undergoing early colonoscopy
and controls (seven studies, OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.49­1.62), or RCT data only (OR = 1.00, 95%
CI 0.52­1.62). Early colonoscopy detected more definitive sources of bleeding (OR = 4.12,
95% CI 2.00­8.49), and was associated with shorter LOS colonoscopy (WMD = -1.52, 95% CI
-2.54 to -0.50 days). No other differences were noted between early and late colonoscopy. AEs
occurred in 4.0%, (95% CI 2.9%; 5.4%) of early colonoscopies. Included studies were of low
quality, with significant heterogeneity for some outcomes.
Conclusion: Early colonoscopy in acute LGIB does not decrease rebleeding, mortality or
need for surgery, but is associated with increased detection of definitive sources of bleeding,
shorter LOS, with low complication incidence. However, the quality of evidence is low,
highlighting the need for additional high-level studies.

· Early colonoscopy in acute LGIB is associ-
ated with increased detection of definitive

Introduction
The management of acute LGIB includes hemo-
dynamic resuscitation, followed by attempts to
localize and treat the bleeding source with endo-
scopic or angiographic interventions, and in
refractory cases, surgery. Diagnostic approaches
include endoscopy, radionuclide red blood
cell scan, CT angiography and mesenteric
angiography.1 Colonoscopy, with its high diag-
nostic yield, is the initial procedure of choice for
most. However, it remains controversial whether
early colonoscopy ­ performed within 12­24 h
of admission ­ provides any clinical benefits.
For example, a prospective, case historical con-
trol study of diverticular bleeding found early
colonoscopy decreased rebleeding and need
for surgery,2 whereas a randomized controlled
trial (RCT) of 100 patients found it only
improved diagnostic yield; a second RCT of 72
patients demonstrated no differences in out-
comes between early and delayed colonoscopy.
Guidelines by the American Society for
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE),3 and the
American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)1
recommend early colonoscopy (within the ini-
tial 24 h) in high-risk patients, with a low qual-
ity of evidence. Because existing studies are of
small sample size and have come to varying con-
clusions, we performed a systematic review and
meta-analysis to determine the impact of early
colonoscopy on clinical outcomes in acute
LGIB.
Methods
Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search was performed
from 1978 to August 2016 using OVID
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and
ISI Web of Knowledge databases with validated
search terms specified for acute LGIB and endos-
copy (see Online Appendix 1). Abstracts pre-
sented at major gastroenterology conferences in
the past 5 years were also hand-searched.
Additional relevant studies were identified from
cross-referencing and hand-searches of references
of the retrieved articles. All human adult studies
published in English were considered.
Study selection and patient population
We selected all randomized and observational
comparative studies that included early colonos-
copy in at least one group of patients presenting
with symptoms suggestive of acute LGIB. Single-
arm studies were identified to define clinical char-
acteristics, incidence and overall outcomes;
comparative studies were used to identify relative
harm or benefit attributable to early colonoscopy.
Early colonoscopy was defined as performed
within 24 h of presentation for prospective obser-
vational studies and RCTs.4 Because we antici-
pated definitions would vary among retrospective
cohorts, we categorized such studies when at least
75% of patients had undergone a colonoscopy
within 24 h of presentation or if the mean (or
median) time to colonoscopy was 24 h or less. We
excluded studies assessing pediatric patients, no
acute LGIB, initial colonoscopy performed only
after 24 h, diagnostic testing only (such as radio-
nuclide red blood cell scan or CT angiography)
other than colonoscopy unless these represented
a control group. Care was taken to avoid double-
counting across studies.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes of the study were overall
rebleeding rates and time to rebleeding, defined
as time of rebleeding following presentation to
hospital or admission. Secondary outcomes
included mortality (related to LGIB and overall),
surgery, total duration of hospital LOS, identifi-
cation of a definite cause of LGIB and adverse
events (AEs). Additional secondary outcomes
included: length of ICU stay, blood transfusions
I Roshan Afshar, MS Sadr et al
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3
received, definite or probable cause of bleeding
(including presence of endoscopic stigmata of
recent hemorrhage if the latter was not available)
and the performance of endoscopic hemostasis.
Finally, etiological endoscopic findings were
described for definite or probable causes of acute
LGIB. The incidence was reported first for all
arms combined.
Validity assessment and data abstraction
Two reviewers evaluated the eligibility of all identi-
fied citations independently, with a third resolving
disagreements. Study quality was assessed using
the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials,5
and the Ottawa­Newcastle criteria for observa-
tional studies.6 The GRADE rating of evidence
characterized the body of literature for each out-
come.7 Available demographic data were extracted,
such as mean age, gender, hemodynamic instabil-
ity and use of antithrombotic therapies, as were
interventions for acute LGIB, and the correspond-
ing aforementioned patient outcomes.
Sources of possible clinical heterogeneity
Possible clinical heterogeneity was evaluated by
reviewing patient populations, nature of the inter-
ventions and definitions of outcomes across stud-
ies. Findings of heterogeneity were used to guide
subsequent subgroup analyses.
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses
Sensitivity analyses were planned according to
the varying control groups to which early colonos-
copy groups were compared, including elective or
delayed colonoscopy, no colonoscopy and other
comparators. Rebleeding definitions were
expected to vary between studies; therefore, addi-
tional sensitivity analyses were performed based
on the availability of a clearly identified definition
for this outcome.
Because of the anticipated varied nature of
reported approaches, definitions of outcomes and
study designs are reported for all early colonos-
copy cohorts <24 h as well as <12 h to character-
ize overall incidence.
Although RCTs were analyzed with controlled
observational studies for the main inferential
analyses, as the advantages of including obser-
vational studies with randomized trials in a
meta-analysis could outweigh the disadvan-
tages,8 RCTs were also analyzed separately.
In addition, we report on one very large study
using a nationwide database (22,720 patients)9
separately.
Statistical analysis and possible sources of
statistical heterogeneity
Descriptive results were reported as proportions
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and sum-
mary statistics expressed as means and standard
deviations (SDs) for continuous variables and
proportions for categorical variables. Effect size
was calculated with weighted mean differences
(WMDs) for continuous variables; medians were
used if means were not available, and SDs were
calculated or imputed when possible.10 Odds
ratios (ORs) were calculated for categorical vari-
ables. The Mantel­Haenszel method for fixed
effect models was applied to determine corre-
sponding overall effect sizes and their CIs, except
when statistical heterogeneity was noted, in which
case a random-effects model was used according
to the DerSimonian and Laird method.11 WMDs
were handled as continuous variables using the
inverse variance approach. The presence of het-
erogeneity across studies was defined using a chi-
square test of homogeneity with a 0.10 significance
level.10 The Higgins I2 statistic12 was calculated to
quantify the proportion of variation in treatment
effects attributable to between-study heterogene-
ity; values of 25%, 50% and 75% represent low,
moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.
For all comparisons, publication bias was evalu-
ated using funnel plots as well as the Begg adjusted
rank correlation13 and Egger regression asymme-
try tests14 if at least three citations were identified.
In order to ensure that zero-event trials did not
significantly affect the heterogeneity or p values, a
continuity correction was added to each trial with
zero-events using the reciprocal of the opposite
treatment arm size.15 All statistical analyses were
done using Meta package in R version 2.13.0 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria, 2008).
Results
Study selection and interventions
Study selection: we initially identified 897 cita-
tions. After review, a total of 876 studies were
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11

excluded. The corresponding PRISMA diagram
is shown in Figure 1. We finally selected a total of
21 citations, including 2 RCTs and 19 observa-
tional studies (4 of which were abstracts, 4 pro-
spectives and 15 retrospectives). One 2005 study
from Strate and colleagues published analyses
from a subgroup from a previous 2003 publica-
tion by Strate and colleagues. Only non-overlap-
ping data from the original population were
retrieved.
Observational studies included 10 early colo-
noscopy cohorts without a comparison arm (2
prospective16,17 and 8 retrospective18­25); in one
we combined two arms of a study assessing bowel
preparation (both groups were early colonoscopy).20
Eleven studies included a comparison group,
including 2 RCTs that compared colonoscopy
within 12 h to standard of care,26 or elective
colonoscopy.27 Among observational studies,
early colonoscopy was compared to elective colo-
noscopy (>24 h) in three studies (one prospective28
and two retrospective29,30), or delayed colonoscopy
in two retrospective studies.9,31 The control group
was no colonoscopy in one study (retrospective),32
surgical treatment in one study2 (prospective)
and radiographic evaluation in another study
(retrospective).33 Data were extracted as possible
in one retrospective study that combined elective
(>24 h) and no colonoscopy as the comparator.4
Because of marked heterogeneity in the literature,
we accepted a broader definition of acute LGIB
than defined a priori, detailed in Supplementary
Table 1. This table also lists corresponding
patient and design characteristics for each study.
Most studies used clinical symptoms as evidence
of rebleeding, with endoscopic confirmation.
Study quality assessment and risk of
publication bias
The quality scores attributed to each study with a
comparison are displayed in Supplementary
Table 1, except for the Cochrane risk of bias
assessment tool summaries for the 2 RCTs that
are included in the Online Appendix. Both RCTs

I Roshan Afshar, MS Sadr et al
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 5
exhibited a high risk of bias due to lack of blind-
ing of study personnel (blinding was not possi-
ble). A high risk of bias was also attributed to the
RCT by Laine and colleagues since the trial was
terminated before reaching the calculated sample
size. The Newcastle­Ottawa scale yielded an
average score of 8.0 ± 1.2 stars (range 5­9 stars;
the highest-quality studies are given nine stars).
Statistical heterogeneity was observed in overall
rebleeding for urgent colonoscopies compared to
elective colonoscopies; results are detailed in
Table 3. The funnel plots, as well as Begg adjusted
rank correlation and Egger regression asymmetry
tests, did not suggest publication bias for any
of the outcomes assessed (data available upon
request).
The GRADE score of evidence for every outcome
was very low; these data are shown in Online
Appendix 3.
Patient and study characteristics
A total of 25,781 patients were included, with
22,720 from a single database study.9 There
were 24,193 patients from studies with compar-
ative arms (9734 in the intervention and 14,459
in the control groups) and 172 from RCTs (86
patients in each arm). The mean age of patients
ranged from 51 to 78 years. A total of 48.5% of
patients were female; 28.7% presented with
hemodynamic instability; 23.7% were on anti-
platelet agents and 6.6% were taking anticoagu-
lants. Detailed patient and study characteristics
for all studies as well as comparative observa-
tional and RCTs are shown in Table 2. In all
studies, it was specified that the colonoscopies
were performed by an expert, defined as a physi-
cian trained in gastroenterology, internal medi-
cine or general surgery.
Primary outcomes
The incidence of rebleeding was 13.5% (95%
CI, 11.8­15.5%) across all arms for all studies
(Table 2). Rebleeding rates were reported in
seven studies with control groups,2,26­30,33 totaling
381 patients undergoing early colonoscopy com-
pared to 551 controls. There was no significant
difference in rebleeding rates between early colo-
noscopy versus all other comparators (OR = 0.89;
95% CI, 0.49­1.62) (Figure 2). Time to rebleed-
ing was specified in only two studies, preventing a
pooled estimate for rebleeding stratified by time
(Table 3). Among the two RCTs, rebleeding
rates did not demonstrate any significant
between-group differences (OR = 1.00; 95% CI,

Secondary outcomes
The incidence of surgery during the hospital stay
was 6.8% (95% CI, 5.2­8.8%) (Figure 3). In five
studies26­29,33 (n = 608) that assessed early colo-
noscopy versus any other comparison, rates of sur-
gery were not significantly different (OR = 0.78;
95% CI, 0.39­1.55). The conclusion was similar
when solely assessing the two RCTs (OR = 0.87;
95% CI, 0.31­2.46). Additional data relating to
incidences and subgroup analyses are shown in
Tables 2 and 3.
The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.4%
(95% CI, 0.3­0.5%) overall (Figure 4) and 1.3%
(95% CI, 0.9­2.0%) when excluding the study by
Navaneethan and colleagues. The incidence of
mortality related to acute LGIB was 1.1% (95%
CI, 0.6­1.8%). No significant difference was
observed for mortality among the six observa-
tional studies (n = 905 without Navaneethan and
colleagues; OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.35­2.31), nor
for the two RCTs (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.04­
35.61) when comparing early colonoscopy to

(n = 522; OR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.12­3.23) nor in
the two RCTs (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.08­4.59).
Mean length of hospital stay was 5.7 ± 5.2 days
for all patients. No significant between-group dif-
ference was noted in four studies27,29,30,32 (n = 785)
for which the data were available (WMD = -0.55;
95% CI, -2.11 to 1.01) (Figure 5). In the RCT
by Laine and colleagues, urgent colonoscopy did
not result in a significantly different hospitaliza-
tion LOS (5.2 ± 0.9 days for early compared to
4.8 ± 0.5 days for elective colonoscopy). Similar
results were noted in the RCT by Green and col-
leagues (5.8 versus 6.6 days, no SD provided),
although we could not use these data as presented
in the summary findings.
For all included studies, a definite source of acute
LGIB was found in 42.0% (95% CI, 40.0­44.0%)
of patients. Among the six studies (n = 1065) that
included a comparison, a greater number of
lesions felt to be the `definite cause of bleeding'
were found after early colonoscopy compared to
all other comparator groups (OR = 4.12; 95%
CI, 2.00­8.49). The conclusion was similar when
considering solely the two RCTs (OR = 2.75;
95% CI, 1.19­6.35).
AEs were found in 4.0% (95% CI; 3.0­5.3%) of
all patients. Complications included perforation,
cardiovascular complications, as well as minor
events such as fever and hypotension. Hemo-
dynamic instability and death were not consid-
ered to be AEs related to the colonoscopy since,
in all studies, the former was recorded prior to
endoscopy only, and death was categorized as
all-cause or disease-related rather than
procedure-related.
Analyzable data were provided in three studies26,27,29
(n = 498) with a comparison group. The study by
Navaneethan and colleagues provided informa-
tion for each separate AE, but could not be com-
bined since each AE type could be counted more
than once for the same patient. There was no sig-
nificant between-group differences (OR = 0.53;
95% CI, 0.19­1.47). When assessing the two
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11
10 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
RCTs, AEs were significantly lower in the early
colonoscopy group (OR = 0.11; 95% CI,
0.02­0.58).
Among the additional secondary outcomes, when
grouping definite or probable cause of bleeding,
no significant differences were noted (OR = 2.94;
95% CI, 0.81­10.64) for all studies with a com-
parison arm, but early colonoscopy yielded sig-
nificantly more such lesions when solely assessing
both RCTs (OR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.30­6.59).
Endoscopic therapy was described in four
studies.8,17,20,34 When only studies with delayed
or elective colonoscopy as a comparator were
included, early colonoscopy increased the likeli-
hood of a therapeutic intervention (OR = 4.17;
95% CI, 2.32­7.49). No difference in endoscopic
intervention was noted in the large study by
Navaneethan and colleagues (35.7% for early
colonoscopy versus 33.3% for delayed/later colo-
noscopy) (p = 0.19). There was no difference in
the use of endoscopic therapy in the early and
elective colonoscopy groups in the RCTs (OR =
5.29; 95% CI, 0.25­114.47).
Length of ICU stay, initial blood transfusion and
total blood transfusion requirements were not sig-
nificantly different between groups for either
observational studies, or in the two RCTs.
Additional recorded incidences comprising pre-
planned secondary outcomes and subgroup anal-
yses are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Three studies2,19,23 included only patients with
diverticular bleeding as a definite or probable
cause of bleeding. Excluding diverticular bleed-
ing, the most common cause of probable or defi-
nite bleeding was colitis among patients
undergoing colonoscopy within 24 h. Diverticular
bleeding was the most frequent finding in colo-
noscopies performed within 12 h (Table 4).
Endoscopic therapy was performed at the time of
early colonoscopy in 34.2% (95% CI,
33.3­35.1%) of patients in all studies and 21.5%
(95% CI, 19.2­24.1%) when excluding the study
by Navaneethan and colleagues). Data available
on the nature of endoscopic therapy are detailed
in Table 4.
Subgroups and sensitivity analyses
Subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary
outcomes including studies of patients undergoing
colonoscopy within 12 h, or studies using alterna-
tive control groups (elective colonoscopy, no colo-
noscopy or non-colonoscopic interventions (such
as surgery or angiography)) resulted in similar
conclusions to the main analyses. However, LOS
was significantly shorter in the early colonoscopy
group compared to elective colonoscopy (WMD
= -1.52; 95% CI, -2.54 to -0.50)
Sensitivity analyses including studies with varying
definitions of acute LGIB also yielded similar
conclusions (see Supplementary Table 2).
Discussion
We performed a formal summary assessment of
the existing literature on the management of
patients with acute LGIB ­ in particular the role
of early colonoscopy (as defined a priori as within
24 h following admission).1 Our review of 21
studies, including 25,935 patients, demonstrated
no differences in rebleeding rates among patients
undergoing early colonoscopies compared to
controls. These findings remained even when
assessing colonoscopy within 12 h in the two
RCTs. Early colonoscopy detected more defini-
tive sources of bleeding (OR = 4.12; 95% CI,
2.00­8.49), and was associated with shorter
LOS versus later colonoscopy (WMD = -1.52;
95% CI, -2.54 to -0.50 days). As benefits in
therapeutic impact are marginal, clinicians need
to ensure hemodynamic stability before initiat-
ing the bowel preparation that is critical to

performing a high-quality early colonoscopy. No
other differences were noted between early and
late colonoscopy. AEs occurred in 4.0% (95%
CI, 3.0­5.3%) of early colonoscopies. However,
the included studies were of low quality, with
only 2 small RCTs among the 21 included stud-
ies, and there existed significant heterogeneity
for some outcomes. Given the conflicting evi-
dence in the literature, mostly from small or
observational studies, our results help to shed
light on the optimal management of patients
presenting with acute LGIB. It was noted that
patients receiving a colonoscopy within 12 h had
higher rates of mortality and surgery compared
with patients in all comparison groups. Patient
instability may explain the increase in the former
as showed in upper GI bleeding; however, these
observations are based principally on observa-
tional, uncontrolled data.35,36
Importantly, recent society recommendations
favor early colonoscopy for patients with high-risk
features, rating quality of evidence as low and the
strength of recommendations as conditional,1
indicating the need for additional research. These
conclusions are supported by our findings that
included additional data published since then.
The recommendation supporting early colonos-
copy is based on the belief that an early colonos-
copy approach identified more patients with a
definitive cause of bleeding1 ­ a finding borne out
in the current meta-analysis, bearing in mind the
difficulty in adjudicating such a subjective out-
come. This result was consistent whether group-
ing all studies, only prospective studies, and only
the two RCTs. The suggested inference is that
the detection of additional lesions allows more
endoscopic therapy, which may result in decreased
rebleeding. However, this benefit was not demon-
strated in our analysis.
The reason for improved detection of bleeding
sources not resulting in an observed decrease in
rebleeding rates is unclear, but may be related to
many factors, including clinical heterogeneity in
study design, inclusion of older studies with lim-
ited options for hemostasis or adopted manage-
ment schemes, variability in endoscopic expertise
impacting both diagnosis and therapy, as well as
methodological considerations such as small
sample sizes in high-quality studies. The short-
ened hospital stay noted may result from earlier
decision-making following a prompt endoscopic
diagnosis (finding a bleeding lesion or excluding
one). The data comparing 12­24 h are harder to
interpret because of widely varying study
methodologies.
Not surprisingly, considering their low inci-
dences and the paucity of patients included in
comparative trials, no significant differences
were noted in mortality or need for surgery
(1.1%, and overall 6.8%, respectively), nor in
disease-related mortality (due to LGIB), with
existing limitations in such adjudication. Studies
were underpowered to show any difference in
these outcomes. Additionally, we found signifi-
cant shortening in LOS attributable to early
colonoscopy (WMD = -1.52; 95% CI, -2.54
to -0.50 days), albeit only among the subgroup
analysis comparing early to later colonoscopy ­
a benefit further justifying recent society
recommendations.1
Large cohort studies are probably more useful
than smaller comparative trials for characterizing
both feasibility and safety of an early colonos-
copy. We noted a low incidence of AEs among
patients undergoing an intervention for acute
LGIB. Early colonoscopy, in particular, was not
associated with increased AEs. However, the
source data were disparate in their categorization
of AEs and difficult to amalgamate.
Our systematic review includes an overall quan-
tification of outcome rates considering observa-
tional and interventional trials with and without
comparators, as well as a more traditional meta-
analysis of comparative trials comparing early
colonoscopy to controls, including targeted sub-
group analyses. As a comparison, a recently
published meta-analysis addressing the role of
early colonoscopy noted increased endoscopic
interventions in the absence of increased diag-
nostic yield and decreased duration of LOS and
costs attributable to early colonoscopy;37 the
rest of the findings were qualitatively similar to
our own. The difference in colonoscopic thera-
pies is hard to interpret in the face of control
groups that did not include colonoscopy, and in
fact disappeared when limiting the analysis to
the control group also receiving a colonoscopy,
but after 24 h. Although adopting an overall
sound methodological approach, this systematic
review performed subgroup analyses combining
the two RCTs with the controlled study by
Jensen and colleagues that was mistakenly con-
sidered a prospective comparative cohort study
I Roshan Afshar, MS Sadr et al
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 13
(whereas it in fact included a historical control
group), and the matched propensity analysis by
Nagata and colleagues, a statistical approach
that fails to obviate residual confounding in
contrast to randomized patient allocation. Both
of these studies are thus at greater methodologi-
cal risk of bias than RCTs, and their inclusion
can be questioned.
Another meta-analysis yielded similar results, but
identified only six studies.38 Furthermore, the
authors chose to exclude patients in whom cecal
intubation could not be achieved ­ a decision that
limits the interpretation and generalizability of
any endoscopic approach when managing patients
with acute LGIB. Indeed, adequacy of the prepa-
ration and feasibility of a complete colonoscopy
are inherently critical components when assessing
impact on patient outcomes.
The main shortcoming of the current systematic
review relates somewhat to statistical and more
importantly to the clinical heterogeneity of exist-
ing literature with disparate studies exhibiting
and methodological limitations. Other than two
small RCTs, all other included studies were het-
erogeneous observational studies with possibility
of bias and confounding, lack of adequate/con-
sistent control groups and varying timings of
colonoscopy, endoscopic treatments, patient
inclusion criteria and definitions of outcomes.
Moreover, there was a paucity of adequately con-
trolled studies. Additionally, there exist possible
issues of generalizability as most of the cohort
studies, and both RCTs (published at least seven
years ago) enrolled patients who were predomi-
nantly male and over 50, with a high proportion
with hemodynamic instability ­ ranging from
29% to 76%. The increased representation of
such sicker patients may not be representative in
acute LGIB and may imply some selection, with
the need in such patients to exclude an upper GI
source of bleeding that can be found in up to
15%.1,27 Recent guidelines define LGIB as the
onset of hematochezia originating from either the
colon or the rectum, but in our meta-analysis only
one study excluded small bowel bleeding,39 with
only one other specifying that small bowel was
diagnosed by capsule endoscopy or double-bal-
loon endoscopy.29 In the RCT by Laine and col-
leagues, selected patients went on to small bowel
contrast radiography after colonoscopy.27 As for
the choice of optimal endoscopic therapy, the
heterogeneity in approaches for given lesions or
locations and the lack of patient-level information
prevents any meaningful conclusions. The defini-
tion and timing of rebleeding varied widely, fur-
ther limiting the validity of available summary
data, even across both RCTs.26,27 Finally, the
approach to patients in the control groups also
varied widely, with included studies spanning 16
years, and a noticeable paucity of data assessing
the role of CT angiography and modern emboli-
zation techniques.1
Such realizations do not detract from the impor-
tance of this analysis and its dissemination in light
of published recommendations so that clinicians
can understand the level of evidence and rationale
for contemporary guidelines. Just as importantly,
however, we feel the aforementioned limitations in
level of evidence should deter endoscopists from
proceeding with a colonoscopy within the first 24 h
following admission if there remain issues of ade-
quate stabilization, patient safety or feasibility con-
cerns related to patient status and comorbidity,
availability of resources and endoscopic expertise.
Conclusion
Early colonoscopy is feasible and safe in acute
LGIB. Although it does not result in decreased
rebleeding, mortality or need for surgery, an increase
in the identification of bleeding sources and a
decrease in length of hospitalization were noted
with the performance of early colonoscopy. The
quality of the evidence is limited by clinical and sta-
tistical heterogeneity, and is further hampered by a
paucity of controlled studies. Additional high-qual-
ity data are needed to better determine whether
colonoscopy performed within 24 h of admission
can improve clinical outcomes such as rebleeding.
