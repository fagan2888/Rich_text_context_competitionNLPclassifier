Concordant Cues in Faces and Voices:
Testing the Backup Signal Hypothesis

Abstract
Information from faces and voices combines to provide multimodal signals about a person. Faces and voices may offer redundant,
overlapping (backup signals), or complementary information (multiple messages). This article reports two experiments which
investigated the extent to which faces and voices deliver concordant information about dimensions of fitness and quality. In
Experiment 1, participants rated faces and voices on scales for masculinity/femininity, age, health, height, and weight. The results
showed that people make similar judgments from faces and voices, with particularly strong correlations for masculinity/femininity,
health, and height. If, as these results suggest, faces and voices constitute backup signals for various dimensions, it is hypothetically
possible that people would be able to accurately match novel faces and voices for identity. However, previous investigations into
novel face­voice matching offer contradictory results. In Experiment 2, participants saw a face and heard a voice and were required
to decide whether the face and voice belonged to the same person. Matching accuracy was significantly above chance level, suggesting
that judgments made independently from faces and voices are sufficiently similar that people can match the two. Both sets of results
were analyzed using multilevel modeling and are interpreted as being consistent with the backup signal hypothesis.

Together, faces and voices convey multimodal signals. Such
signals are common in animals and occur when information
about an underlying trait is communicated by more than one
modality. As most research has focused on face and voice
ratings independently of each other (Wells, Baguley, Sergeant,
& Dunn, 2013; Wells, Dunn, Sergeant, & Davies, 2009), rela-
tively little is known about multimodal signals in humans.
Multimodal signals are either backup signals (Johnstone,
1997), or multiple messages (Møller & Pomiankowski,
1993), and are likely to have adaptive value in terms of mate
choice. Backup signals are redundant in meaning: they offer
similar information and elicit the same response, thereby help-
ing to reduce inaccurate trait assessments (Møller & Pomian-
kowski, 1993). It is therefore possible to distinguish between
multiple messages and backup signals by empirically testing
the effect of multimodal signals on a recipient (Partan & Mar-
ler, 1999). If a multimodal signal present in human faces and
voices is a backup signal for a certain dimension, ratings on this
dimension should correlate, whereas uncorrelated ratings
would reflect the presence of multiple messages (Wells et al.,
2013; Wells et al., 2009).
Multimodal Signals in Faces and Voices
Faces and voices are salient social stimuli, offering a multitude
of identity and affective information (Belin, Fecteau, &
Bedard, 2004). From an evolutionary perspective, faces and
voices provide valuable clues about fitness. For example, in
terms of attractiveness they appear to constitute reliable and
concordant signals of genetic quality (e.g., Collins & Missing,
2003; Feinberg, 2008; Feinberg et al., 2005; Fraccaro et al.,
2010; Saxton, Caryl, & Roberts, 2006; Thornhill & Gangestad,
1999; Thornhill & Grammer, 1999; Wheatley et al., 2014;
Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997; see also Puts, Jones, & DeBruine,
2012 for a review), and a number of studies have found that
people who have faces that rate highly for attractiveness also

tend to have voices that rate highly for attractiveness (e.g.,
Collins & Missing, 2003; Saxton et al., 2006, but see Oguchi
& Kikuchi, 1997; Wells et al., 2013).
With the exception of the attractiveness literature, previous
research has rarely compared judgments made from faces and
voices, focusing instead on judgments informed by a single
modality (e.g., Neiman & Applegate, 1990; Penton-Voak &
Chen, 2004; Perrett et al., 1998; Pisanski, Mishra, & Rendall,
2012). However, there are a number of reasons as to why we
may expect concordance between face and voice ratings in
terms of masculinity and femininity, health, age, height, and
weight. Some of these reasons are detailed below.
Masculinity/femininity. Levels of reproductive hormone levels are
likely to influence perceptions of both facial and vocal femi-
ninity and masculinity. For example, testosterone increases the
size and thickness of vocal folds (Beckford, Rood, & Schaid,
1985), resulting in lower fundamental frequency (Fant, 1960),
which influences perceptions of masculinity (Pisanski et al.,
2012). In addition, high levels of testosterone are associated
with characteristics of facial masculinity (Penton-Voak &
Chen, 2004; Perrett et al., 1998), such as larger jaws, chins,
and noses (Miller & Todd, 1998). In women, estrogen slows
down vocal fold development and is associated with higher
vocal pitch (Abitbol, Abitbol, & Abitbol, 1999; O'Connor,
Re, & Feinberg, 2011). Estrogen levels are also related to mar-
kers of facial femininity (Thornhill & Grammer, 1999) such as
larger lips, smaller lower faces, and fat deposits on the upper
cheeks (Perrett et al., 1998).
Health. We might also expect ratings of health made from faces
and voices to be similar. Previous research suggests that cues
relating to higher levels of reproductive hormones are reliable
indicators of fitness and quality (Folstad & Karter, 1992;
Thornhill & Gangestad, 2006; Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997), and,
indeed, some studies suggest that measures of sexual dimorph-
ism are linked to health ratings and actual health in both men
(Gray, Berlin, McKinlay, & Longcope, 1991; Rhodes, Chan,
Zebrowitz, & Simmons, 2003) and women (Ellison, 1999; Law
Smith et al., 2006).
Age. Faces and voices index information about biological age, a
cue which is relevant to reproductive fitness in both males and
females (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1999). Numerous visual mar-
kers act as indicators of older age, such as decreased elasticity
in the skin, wrinkles, discoloration, and reduced clarity in skin
tone (Burt & Perrett, 1995). In terms of voices, older people
speak with a slower speech rate (Linville, 1996), and age-
related hormonal changes affect pitch. For example, female
voice pitch lowers after the menopause, whereas older male
voices become higher pitched (Linville, 1996). People can esti-
mate a speaker's age from their voice relatively accurately (to
within about 10 years; Braun, 1996; Neiman & Applegate,
1990; Ptacek & Sander, 1966; Smith & Baguley, 2014).
Height and weight. Body size is a further indicator of quality
(Collins & Missing, 2003; Thornhill & Gangestad, 1999).
However, although people tend to agree about height and
weight judgments made from a voice (Collins, 2000), this does
not indicate that they are necessarily accurate (Bruckert,
Li´
enard, Lacroix, Kreutzer, & Leboucher, 2006; Collins,
2000; van Dommelen & Moxness, 1995). Despite the apparent
inaccuracy of height judgments made from voices, people
judge height from faces with relative accuracy (Schneider,
Hecht, Stevanov, & Carbon, 2013), using cues such as facial
elongation. People with longer faces are judged as being taller
(Re et al., 2013). Judgments from faces are also accurate for
weight estimates (Coetzee, Chen, Perrett, & Stephen, 2010).
Lass and Colt (1980) compared visual and auditory height and
weight ratings. Results showed significant differences between
weight ratings from female faces and voices, suggesting that
for some characteristics, faces and voices may not offer con-
cordant information. Recent research has not addressed the
extent of concordance between body size information offered
by faces and voices. Although Krauss, Freyberg, and Morsella
(2002) asked participants to rate the age, height, and weight of
speakers from faces and voices, they only tested whether the
ratings were accurate, rather than whether there was a relation-
ship between face and voice ratings.
Static and Dynamic Faces
The extent to which faces and voices offer concordant infor-
mation might be affected by whether the face is static or
dynamic. For example, Lander (2008) found that male face and
voice attractiveness was only related when faces were
dynamic. Studies investigating facial attractiveness and human
mate preferences most frequently use static facial stimuli
(photos). However, there has been a recent move to use
dynamic facial stimuli (videos) in order to improve ecological
validity (Gangestad & Scheyd, 2005; Penton-Voak & Chang,
2008; Roberts, Saxton et al., 2009b). Some studies have found
that facial stimulus type (static or dynamic) influences attrac-
tiveness judgments, although the overall results are somewhat
mixed (e.g., Lander, 2008; Penton-Voak & Chang, 2008;
Roberts, Little, et al., 2009a; Rubenstein, 2005). In reviewing
previous studies and investigating methodological differences
between them, Roberts, Saxton et al. (2009b) reported that
correlations between ratings from static and dynamic facial
stimuli were stronger when rated by the same participants,
likely because of carryover effects. As patterns of facial move-
ment vary according to sex (Morrison, Gralewski, Campbell, &
Penton-Voak, 2007), it is conceivable that masculinity/femi-
ninity ratings will be more extreme when viewing dynamic
faces. In light of these findings, it is necessary to consider the
influence of facial stimulus type when testing the concordance
of face­voice judgments.
Face­voice matching provides a further test of the extent to
which faces and voices offer redundant information. However,
it is not clear from the literature whether accurate face­voice
matching using static facial stimuli is possible. While Kamachi,
Hill, Lander, and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2003) showed that parti-
cipants could match dynamic muted faces saying different

sentences to voices of the same identity, participants performed
at chance level when the facial stimuli were static. Similar
results were reported by Lachs and Pisoni (2004). However,
Mavica and Barenholtz (2013) observed above chance level
accuracy on trials featuring static faces, suggesting that above
chance matching ability is not dependent on being able to
encode visual articulatory patterns but rather on concordant
information offered by faces and voices.
Aims
This article investigates the extent to which faces and voices
offer concordant information, thereby providing a test of the
backup signal hypothesis (Johnstone, 1997). Using both static
and dynamic facial stimuli, we tested cross-modal concordance
by asking participants to make judgments from faces and
voices about perceived femininity/masculinity, health, age,
height, and weight. In a further test of face­voice concordance,
we investigated whether it is possible to accurately match novel
static or dynamic faces and voices of the same identity. If faces
and voices offer similar information, and it is possible to match
the two, this would offer support for the backup signal
hypothesis.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 tested whether faces and voices offer concordant
information about dimensions of fitness and quality, aiming to
establish whether people make similar judgments about a novel
person, regardless of whether they see their face or hear their
voice. We expect that as the previous literature suggests that
both faces and voices honestly signal quality, judgments made
independently from faces and voices should be similar. In light
of the contradictory findings regarding judgments made from
static and dynamic facial stimuli, the study also tested whether
the relationship between face and voice ratings differs accord-
ing to facial stimulus type (static vs. dynamic).
Method
Design
This experiment employed a mixed design. The between-
subject factor was facial stimulus type (static or dynamic), and
the within-subject factor was modality (face or voice)
Participants
The participants (n ¼ 48) were recruited from the Nottingham
Trent University Psychology Division's Research Participation
Scheme. There were 12 male and 36 female participants (age
range ¼ 18­28 years, M ¼ 20.54, SD ¼ 2.59). Participants gave
informed consent and received a research credit in line with
course requirements. The College Research Ethics Committee
for Business, Law and Social Sciences granted ethical approval
for the study (ref: 2013/37). All participants reported having
normal to corrected hearing and vision.
Apparatus and Materials
Stimulus faces and voices were taken from the Grid audiovisual
sentence corpus (Cooke, Barker, Cunningham, & Shao, 2006),
a multi-talker corpus featuring head and shoulder videos of
British adult speakers saying 1,000, six-word sentences each
in an emotionally neutral manner recorded against a plain blue
background. Each sentence follows the same six-word struc-
ture: (1) command, (2) color, (3) preposition, (4) letter, (5)
digit, and (6) adverb, for example, ``Place blue at J 9 now.''
None of the speakers in the corpus say the same sentence. A
total of 18 speakers were selected from the corpus: 9 males and
9 females. Speakers were matched for ethnicity (White Brit-
ish), accent (English), and age (18­30).
The stimuli were presented on an Acer Aspire laptop (screen
size 15.6 inches, resolution 1,366 Â 768 pixels, Dolby
Advanced Audio) placed approximately 8.5 cm away from the
edge of the desk at which participants sat. The experiment was
run using Psychopy v1.77.01 (Peirce, 2009), an open-source
software package designed for running experiments in Python.
Three videos (.mpegs) were selected at random from the GRID
corpus for each speaker, using an online research randomizer
(Urbaniak & Plous, 2013). The study used static faces, dynamic
faces, and voices. One of the three videos was used to create
static pictures of faces. Pictures were extracted using the snap-
shot function on Windows Movie Maker (2012) and presented
in .png format. The static picture for each talker was the first
frame of the video. Another of the three video files was used to
construct the dynamic stimuli. The file was muted using Win-
dows Movie Maker and converted back into .mpeg format. All
facial stimuli measured 384 Â 288 pixels and were presented in
color for 2 s, with brightness settings at the maximum level.
Voice recordings were also played for 2 s, from the third .mpeg
file, but the face was not visible at presentation. To reduce the
background noise, participants listened to the recordings binau-
rally through Apple earphones with a frequency range of 5­
21,000 Hz. This exceeds the range of human hearing (Feinberg
et al., 2005). Voices were played at a comfortable listening
volume (30% of the maximum volume). Two versions of the
experiment were constructed: one using static faces and voices
and the other using dynamic faces and voices. In both versions,
all 18 faces and voices appeared.
Procedure. Participants were randomly allocated to either the
static face or the dynamic face version of the experiment. They
read the information sheet, completed the consent form, and
provided demographic information. Testing took place in a
quiet cubicle. Participants completed two counterbalanced
blocks of testing. In one block participants viewed faces, in the
other they heard voices. Participants were not told that the
voices and faces featured in the experiment belonged to the
same people. Each block consisted of a practice trial followed
by 18 randomly ordered experimental trials. After each face or
voice, participants estimated the age of the stimulus person in
years and completed the 7-point Likert-style rating scales in the
following order: femininity/masculinity (1 ¼ very feminine,
Smith et al. 3
7 ¼ very masculine), health (1 ¼ very unhealthy, 7 ¼ very
healthy), height (1 ¼ very short, 7 ¼ very tall), and weight
(1 ¼ very underweight, 7 ¼ very overweight).
Data Analysis and Multilevel Modeling
Data were analyzed using multilevel models, rather than per-
forming conventional analyses on data averaged over either par-
ticipants or stimuli (see Wells et al., 2013). This avoids the
ecological fallacy which arises when it is falsely assumed that
patterns observed for participant means also hold for data at a
lower level of analysis such as individual trials repeated within
participants (e.g., see Robinson, 1950; Wells et al., 2013). Multi-
level modeling allows both participants and stimuli to be simul-
taneously treated as random effects, thereby maximizing
generalizability (Clark, 1973; Judd, Westfall, & Kenny, 2012).
When the random effects are fully crossed (i.e., when all parti-
cipants experience all stimuli), conventional analyses (including
separate by-items or by-subjects analyses) can lead to massive
Type 1 error inflation (Baguley, 2012; Clark, 1973; Judd et al.,
2012). The most appropriate analysis therefore takes into
account both sources of variability. Unless the ignored source
of variability is negligible, this is always more conservative than
separate by-stimuli or by-participants analyses.
Results
We calculated the absolute difference between face and voice
ratings by comparing each rating participants had given to a face
and voice belonging to the same person. Then we calculated the
mean absolute difference (MAD) for each stimuli person on each
rating scale (age, masculinity/femininity, health, height, and
weight). Descriptive statistics (Table 1) indicate that typical rat-
ings for faces and voices fall within a similar range.
On all scales apart from age, face and voice ratings only
differ on average by about 1 point (14%) on a 7-point rating
scale, and MADs were similar across static and dynamic facial
stimuli. The difference between face and voice ratings in terms
of age appears larger than that of the other rating scales. How-
ever, rather than being rated on a 7-point scale, age estimates
were given in years. This prevents a neat comparison between
the rating scales.
The results in Table 1 show that face and voice ratings tend to
be close together in terms of the range they fall into. A logical
next step is to quantify the extent to which voice and face ratings
covary in the same individual. For this purpose, a simple corre-
lation coefficient between voice and face ratings would either
ignore the dependency within participants or rely only on aggre-
gate data (mean ratings for each participant). We therefore used
multilevel models to account for both participant and stimuli
variation when correlating voice ratings with face ratings for
estimated age and ratings for femininity/masculinity, health,
height, and weight. For each variable, we fitted an intercept-
only model with the rating as an outcome, using the lme4 pack-
age in R (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014). A crucial
part of each model was to estimate separate variance for face and
voice ratings as well as the correlation between face and voice
ratings across both stimuli and participants. The correlation
between face and voice ratings within participants is, for present
purposes, a nuisance term (merely indicating that participants
who give high ratings to voices also tend to give high ratings to
faces) and is not reported here. The correlations reported in
Table 2 are those within stimuli and demonstrate that, for a given
item, voice and face ratings are positively correlated.
Table 2 provides evidence that mean face and voice ratings
for the same target appear to be positively related for all rating
types. Correlations between face and voice ratings on scales for
masculinity/femininity, health, and height were particularly
high, regardless of whether the facial stimuli were static or
dynamic. Correlations between mean face and voice ratings for
age and weight were moderate when facial stimuli were sta-
tic--with some suggestion that the correlations were dimin-
ished for dynamic stimuli. However, correlations did not vary
according to facial stimulus type in direction or by more than .3
on any scale. The difference between the static and dynamic
correlations was tested by fitting models with separate variance
terms for each stimulus type. Comparing a model which
includes separate variance and covariance terms for static and
dynamic stimuli with one that does not did not improve the
model fit for any of the ratings (p > .14). This complements the
results shown in Table 1, suggesting that the extent to which
faces and voices offer similar information is not greatly influ-
enced by whether the facial stimuli is static or dynamic.
Discussion
Experiment 1 showed that observers glean concordant infor-
mation about different dimensions of quality from faces and

voices, particularly in terms of masculinity and femininity,
health, and height. On each dimension, the relatedness of face
and voice ratings is not affected by facial stimulus type, show-
ing that the signals tested here are stable across static and
dynamic faces. These results support the hypothesis that on
various dimensions of quality, faces and voices constitute
backup signals.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 tested whether faces and voices offer sufficiently
concordant information that people can match novel faces to
voices. Previous studies have addressed this question, with
conflicting results. Krauss et al. (2002) showed that people are
relatively accurate at inferring physical information from a
voice. After only hearing a voice excerpt, participants selected
the speaker's full-length photograph from one of two possible
options with above chance accuracy. Mavica and Barenholtz
(2013) tested whether people could use information from a
voice to distinguish between two static images of different
faces. Accuracy was significantly above chance level, despite
contradictory results presented in previous studies (Kamachi et
al., 2003; Lachs & Pisoni, 2004) suggesting that successful
matching of faces and voices depends on the ability to encode
dynamic properties of speaking (muted) faces (Mavica & Bare-
nholtz, 2013).
Previous face­voice matching studies (Kamachi et al., 2003;
Krauss et.al., 2002; Mavica & Barenholtz, 2013) have used a
two-alternative forced choice paradigm (2AFC), which unlike a
same­different paradigm does not model whether people are
also able to correctly reject a match when a face and voice are
from different people. The 2AFC tasks therefore give no infor-
mation about possible response biases. Experiment 2 uses a
same­different paradigm to give a clearer picture of face­voice
matching ability.
Experiment 2 addresses three main questions. First, whether it
is possible to accurately match novel faces and voices of the same
age (20­30), sex, and ethnicity (White British). Second, whether
matching accuracy is affected by facial stimulus type (static or
dynamic). Third, in line with cross-modal matching procedures
(Kamachi et al., 2003; Lachs & Pisoni, 2004), we investigated
whether people are more accurate at face­voice matching when
visual information (a face) is presented first, compared to when
auditory information (a voice) is presented first. If faces and
voices primarily constitute backup signals, people should be able
to match novel faces and voices above chance level.
Method
The methods for Experiment 2 were the same as for Experi-
ment 1, with exceptions explained in the following subsections.
Design
This experiment employed a 2 Â 2 Â 2 mixed factorial design.
The between-subject factor was facial stimulus type (static or
dynamic). The within-subject factors were identity (same or
different) and order (face first or voice first). The dependent
variable was accuracy.
Participants
There were 40 male and 40 female adult participants (n ¼ 80)
with an age range of 18­66 years (M ¼ 25.44, SD ¼ 8.36).
Materials
Four different versions of the experiment were created so that
matching and not-matching pairs of faces and voices could be
constructed using different stimulus people. Stimuli were ran-
domly selected to be used for either one of the eight same
identity or eight different identity trials. None of the faces or
voices appeared more than once in each version. On different
identity trials, the face and voice were matched for age, gender,
and ethnicity. The stimuli that remained were used for the
practice trials. Each version was repeated for static and
dynamic conditions. In total, there were eight versions.
Procedure
Participants were randomly allocated to one of the eight ver-
sions of the experiment. In the dynamic facial stimulus condi-
tion, participants were also correctly informed that the face in
the muted video and the voice in the recording were not saying
the same thing. This was to prevent them using speech reading
to match the face and voice (Kamachi et al., 2003).
Participants completed two counterbalanced experimental
blocks, each consisting of a practice trial followed by eight
randomly ordered experimental trials. In one block, partici-
pants saw the face first, and in the other they heard the voice
first. None of the stimuli appeared more than once in each
version of the experiment. In each trial, there was a 1-s gap
between presentation of the face and voice stimuli. At test,
participants pressed ``1'' if they thought the face and voice
were ``matching'' (same identity), and ``0'' if they thought it
was ``not matching'' (different identity).
Results
Performance accuracy was analyzed using multilevel logistic
regression with the lme4 version 1.06 package in R (Bates
et al., 2014). Four nested models with accuracy (0 or 1) as the
dependent variable were compared (and all models were fitted
using restricted maximum likelihood). The first model included
a single intercept (and was later used to obtain confidence
intervals for the overall accuracy). The second model also
included the main effects of each factor (identity, order, and
stimulus type). The third model added all two-way interactions
and the final model added the three-way interaction. Setting up
the model in this way allows us to test for individual effects in a
manner similar to that of a traditional analysis of variance.
However, as F-tests-derived multilevel models are not, in gen-
eral, accurate, we report the more robust profile likelihood ratio
Smith et al. 5
tests provided by lme4. These were obtained by dropping each
effect in turn from the appropriate model (e.g., testing the
three-way interaction by dropping it from the model including
all effects, and testing the two-way interactions by dropping
each effect in turn from the two-way model).
Table 3 shows the profile likelihood chi-square statistic (G2)
and p-value associated with dropping each effect. Table 3 also
reports the coefficients and standard errors (on a log odds scale)
for each effect in the full three-way interaction model. In the
three-way model, the estimate of SD of the face random effect
was 0.353, while for voice it was 0.207. The estimated SD for
the participant effect was less than 0.0001. A similar pattern
held for the null model. Thus, although individual differences
were negligible in this instance, a conventional by-participants
analysis that did not incorporate both voice and face variation
could be extremely misleading.
Only the main effect of identity and the two-way interaction
of identity and order were statistically significant. To aid inter-
pretation of these effects, we obtained means and confidence
intervals for the percentage accuracy of the eight conditions in
the factorial design. These confidence intervals were obtained
through simulations of the posterior distributions of the cell
means using arm package version 1.6 in R (Gelman & Su,
2013). These means and the associated 95% confidence inter-
vals are shown in Figure 1.
From Figure 1 it is clear that overall matching performance
was significantly above chance (50%) level, M ¼ 59.7%, 95%
CI [51.9, 66.9]. Static face­voice matching was above chance,
M ¼ 59.19, 95% CI [50.94, 66.84], as was dynamic face­voice
matching, M ¼ 60.12, 95% CI [51.97, 67.74]. Figure 1 also
reveals the main effect of identity, with performance for same
trials consistently higher than for different trials (and the for-
mer but not the latter consistently above chance). It also reveals
the basis of the identity by order interaction. The results from
the face first trials are shown in Panel A. The results from the
voice first trials are shown in Panel B. Although same identity
trials showed better performance than different trials for both
face first and voice first trials, this advantage is greater in the
face first conditions. Given that performance on the face first
different trials is on average worse than chance (and signifi-
cantly so for the static stimuli), this pattern suggests the oper-
ation of a response bias, such that participants exhibited a bias
to accept faces and voices as belonging to the same identity
when they saw the face before hearing the voice.
Discussion
In Experiment 2, we observed that both dynamic faces and
voices, and static faces and voices, can be matched for identity
above chance level. These results are consistent with the
hypotheses informed by the results of Experiment 1, which
show that faces and voices offer a high level of concordant
information on various dimensions. Face­voice matching per-
formance does not differ according to facial stimulus type.
Therefore, accuracy does not appear to depend on encoding
visual information about speaking style but rather on redundant
signals available in voices and static faces.
General Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with the hypothesis
that faces and voices offer redundant signals for various dimen-
sions of quality. Mean face and voice ratings for the same target
were positively related for all rating types. Correlations
between face and voice ratings on scales for masculinity/fem-
ininity, health, and height were particularly strong, regardless
of whether the facial stimuli were static or dynamic. The results
of Experiment 2 show that the information signaled by faces
and voices is so similar that people can match novel faces and
voices of the same sex, ethnicity, and age-group at a level
significantly above chance. Taken together, results suggest that
faces and voices constitute backup signals, reinforcing the
same information about quality (Johnstone, 1997) rather than

complementary but different information (Møller & Pomian-
kowski, 1993).
Face and Voice Ratings
With the exception of the attractiveness literature, previous
research has rarely compared judgments made from faces and
voices, focusing instead on judgments informed by a single
modality (e.g., Penton-Voak & Chen 2004; Perrett et al.,
1998; Pisanski et al., 2012; Neiman & Applegate, 1990, and
so on) or comparing face and voice ratings to actual measure-
ments of physical characteristics (e.g., Krauss et al., 2002)
rather than to each other. The results of Experiment 1 show
that not only do face and voice ratings fall within a small range
but independent ratings of an individual's face and voice are
positively correlated. These results complement other studies,
showing that faces and voices offer related information about
fitness and mate value (Collins & Missing, 2003; Feinberg,
2008; Feinberg et al., 2005; Fraccaro et al., 2010).
The strongest correlations between face and voice ratings
occurred on scales for masculinity/femininity, health, and
height. Despite the previous literature suggesting that unimodal
voice ratings of body size are less accurate than unimodal face
ratings (Bruckert et al., 2006; Coetzee et al., 2010; Collins,
2000; Re et al., 2013; van Dommelen & Moxness, 1995),
Experiment 1 showed that regardless of accuracy, the MAD
between body size judgments made from faces and voices was
small. However, correlations were strong for height but only
weak-moderate for weight. This corresponds with Lass and
Colt (1980) who found significant differences between weight
ratings for female faces and voices.
Face and Voice Matching
Overall, face­voice matching accuracy in Experiment 2 was
significantly above chance. This result is consistent with pre-
vious findings (Krauss et al., 2002; Mavica & Barenholtz,
2013) and shows that people can use redundant information
to match faces and voices of the same identity. Furthermore,
the use of multilevel modeling allows us to generalize these
findings beyond the sample of faces and voices used, thereby
overcoming a common limitation of previous studies.
Although overall matching accuracy is at 59.7%, there is
still a substantial proportion of unexplained variance which
could be due to the existence of discordant rather than concor-
dant face­voice information. Beyond the characteristics tested
in Experiment 1, faces and voices also convey a multitude of
other information, including personality characteristics and
emotion (Belin et al., 2004; Mavica & Barenholtz, 2013), some
of which might be complementary. Nevertheless, the results
from Experiment 2 suggest that on balance, faces and voices
provide concordant information because overall performance is
significantly above chance level. These results are consistent
with the results presented in Experiment 1.
On different identity trials, participants performed at chance
level (voice first trials), or below chance level (face first trials),
and were significantly less accurate than on same identity trials.
This indicates that participants were better at detecting a correct
match than rejecting an incorrect one. In line with the argument
presented above, based purely on the findings from Experiment
1, we might have expected that accurately rejecting mismatches
would be possible because the ratings were so closely related. It
seems that participants are using other information to inform
their matching decisions on different identity trials. On the other
hand, the pattern of results across same­different trials might be
partially explained by the existence of a response bias.
While previous face­voice matching studies using 2AFC pro-
cedures have found no difference between face first and voice
first performance (Kamachi et al., 2003; Lachs & Pisoni, 2004),
our results using a same­different task suggest people exhibit a
bias to respond that a face and voice belong to the same identity,
particularly when the face is presented before the voice. A per-
formance asymmetry, according to stimuli order, is consistent
with the previous literature. For instance, studies have consis-
tently found asymmetries between faces and voices in terms of
rates of recognition accuracy, which have been attributed to
differential link strength in the two perception pathways (e.g.,
Damjanovic & Hanley, 2007; Hanley & Turner, 2000; Steve-
nage, Hugill, & Lewis, 2012). Therefore, there is no reason to
assume that face first and voice first matching performance
should be identical. However, based on the finding that familiar
faces prime familiar voices better than familiar voices prime
familiar faces (Stevenage et al., 2012), we might have expected
the asymmetry to operate the other way around. Nevertheless, it
is feasible that voices give more information about faces than
faces do about voices, and aside from conveying semantic infor-
mation about the spoken message, the other important role of
voices is to allow people to infer socially relevant visual infor-
mation about the speaker, such as information about masculi-
nity/femininity, body size, health, and age. This idea is in
keeping with the finding that showing participants mismatched
celebrity face­voice pairs disrupts voice recognition to a greater
extent than it disrupts face recognition (Stevenage, Neil, & Ham-
lin, 2014). During social interactions, it is common to hear a
voice while not looking in the direction of the speaker. Being
able to accept or reject a face match quickly may aid social
communication by facilitating attention shifts.
Static and Dynamic Faces
Informed by contradictory findings relating to the effect of static
and dynamic facial stimuli on ratings of attractiveness (e.g.,
Lander, 2008; Roberts, Little, et al., 2009a; Rubenstein, 2005)
and face­voice matching ability (Kamachi et al., 2003; Lachs &
Pisoni, 2004; Mavica & Barenholtz, 2013), we tested whether
facial stimulus type affected the extent of face­voice concor-
dance. In both experiments, performance was unaffected by
whether the facial stimuli were dynamic or static. This suggests
that information on these dimensions is stable across dynamic
and static faces. Novel face­voice matching ability is not due to
encoding visual articulatory patterns (Mavica & Barenholtz,
2013) but to the availability of redundant information.
Smith et al. 7
Stimulus Sample Size
The findings of the multilevel models we report emphasize the
importance of stimulus sample size in estimating effects. These
models provide the tools to generalize over both participants
and stimuli, but obtaining large samples of stimuli is challen-
ging. The corpus (Cooke et al., 2006) we used only contained 18
stimulus individuals matched for age, gender, and ethnicity.
This reduced the set of stimuli available for study but also
reduced extraneous variability. In addition, all of the people
in this stimulus set were from similar educational backgrounds
(Cooke et al., 2006), and none of them exhibited strong regional
accents. As there is a high level of interstimulus variability in
both faces (Valentine, Lewis, & Hills, 2015) and voices (Ste-
venage & Neil, 2014), we would encourage future face­voice
matching studies to aim for larger samples of stimuli, having
demonstrated that it is variation in faces and voices that is the
limiting factor on statistical power in experiments such as these
(as face and voice variation is consistently higher than partici-
pant variation). However, many published studies have used
samples of stimuli far smaller than 18 when investigating per-
son perception (see G. L. Wells & Windshitl, 1999), as have
other face­voice matching studies (e.g., Lachs & Pisoni, 2004).
Crucially, only by accounting for variability in stimuli is it
reasonable to generalize from stimuli as well as participants.
Even in studies using large sample of stimuli, generalizability is
limited by the common practice of aggregating over stimuli
(Clark, 1973; Judd et al., 2012; Wells et al., 2013). Ultimately,
the adequate sample size of stimuli or participants in experi-
mental designs such as those reported here is a question of
statistical power (e.g., see Westfall, Kenny, & Judd, 2014).
Conclusion
Faces and voices of the same identity offer redundant signals
about a number of dimensions associated with quality and
fitness. Information about masculinity/femininity, height, and
health is particularly similar across faces and voices. We have
shown that the level of redundancy between faces and voices is
sufficient that it is possible to accurately match them for iden-
tity. In summary, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 are more
consistent with the backup signal hypothesis (Johnstone, 1997)
than the multiple messages hypothesis (Møller & Pomian-
kowski, 1993). As multimodal signals for various indicators
of quality, faces, and voices offer concordant rather than com-
plementary information.
