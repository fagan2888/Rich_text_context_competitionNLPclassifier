Introduction
Qaisra Shahraz enjoys a distinct position among contempo-
rary Pakistani authors writing in English. Her concerns are
mainly social and not political. Unlike Bapsi Sidhwa (An
American Brat, 1993) and Mohammed Hanif (A Case of
Exploding Mangoes, 2008), Shahraz is not interested in the
ravages of General Zia's military regime and its tailored
Islamization in the late 1980s Pakistan. Similarly, her fiction
also stands apart from the ramifications of 9/11 unlike
Mohsin's Hamid's critique (The Reluctant Fundamentalist,
2007) on the Muslim fundamentalist discourse which pre-
dominantly surfaced as an aftermath of the said tragedy. This
indeed is something which distinguishes Shahraz's writings
from the mainstream Pakistani fictions written in English
which are predominantly political (Siddiqui, 2011). The tra-
jectory of Shahraz's literary sensibility is overwhelmingly
social with an exclusive focus on the woman question as it
stands in the postcolonial milieu of rural Pakistan. This
explains her interest in the social positioning of Pakistani
women especially in relation to practices like enforced mar-
riage and celibacy, violence in marriage, divorce, female
sexuality, hijab, inheritance, childbearing, and so on. In the
context of Pakistani fiction written in English, Shahraz, like
many of her contemporaries, can be categorized as a dias-
pora writer who displays an increasing sense of postcolonial-
ity featuring the lives of Pakistani masses in general. This
explains why her fiction essentially features the dynamics of
struggle, identity, representation, and the problems of the
indigenous culture as it functions through a post(-)colonial
society which is still holding on to the remnants of a by-gone
colonialism (Ahmed, 2009).
Shahraz's texts, especially her novel The Holy Woman
(2001), are deeply embedded in the intricacies of tradition,
custom, and passion that feature the present-day Pakistan.
Her characters apparently deal with situations, which are
mostly mundane and quite day-to-day. Nevertheless, they
eventually embark upon circumstances that bring out queer
stories. Shahraz opts for rural settings where lives of people
are intense but filled with tradition and humility. With this
comes in the problem of tribal tradition which stands in the
way of change--a fact not new to Muslim rural culture since
the tribal society of 7th-century Arabia too resisted changes
that had been brought about by Islam (Haddad & Esposito,
1997). Such a fixation with tradition poses extraordinary
challenges to women in rural Pakistan. This explains why the
lives of Shahraz's characters comprise several complexities,
thus provoking the readers' minds. Besides the rural plane,
Shahraz's text also operates at the global level where she
depicts Muslims being citizens of a world which is now most

Violence Ritualized: The Chemistry of
Tradition and Religion in Qaisra
Shahraz's The Holy Woman
Nausheen Ishaque1
Abstract
This article aims to undertake a study of The Holy Woman by Qaisra Shahraz in terms of how it brings forth the woman
question by effectively reflecting on the dangerous chemistry of tradition and religion--a chemistry meant to legitimize
ritualization of violence. This naturally entails discussion on the way tradition is made to conspire with religion against women
with an exclusive theoretical underpinning of postcolonial feminism. The author has kept the focus of study limited to the
issues of female sexuality, celibacy, and hijab. Evidently, the discussion dilates upon how religion is superseded by tradition.
This unavoidably causes circumstances culminating in realities that stamp the destitute and dismay of women hailing from the
third world postcolonial order.

globalized and urbanized. Human suffering and agony at the
hands of a perverted fate is one of her favorite themes. This
can be seen in case of Zari Bano, her protagonist in The Holy
Woman. Shahraz fixes her authorial focus on her country of
origin, which is a tradition-bound Muslim society.
Shahraz's affiliation with "Muslim" feminism has brought
her under the spotlight both among her Muslim and non-
Muslim readers. It is therefore imperative to critically study
her position as a Muslim feminist in a post-9/11 world that
has witnessed huge shifts in socio-literary allegiances of
Muslim authors, especially the ones with diasporic identities.
Ali (2013, p. 201) brings forth the "risk" attached with texts
like that of Shahraz as these are based on representational
politics using the feminist agenda and reinforce Western
hegemonic discourse. This reminds one of the views upheld
by Hamid Dabashi (2011) who attaches the term "comprador
intellectuals" with the highly feted writers originating from
the East but celebrated in the West for their undaunted show
of dissent from within the Muslim world (p. 72). Dabashi is
intensely critical of such writers as their literary and intel-
lectual output justifies the demonization and dehumanization
of Arab world in particular and Muslim world in general.
Undoubtedly, on a superficial reading, the politics of
female representation in Shahraz's text is sensational. Zari
Bano's destiny associated with haqbakhshwana1 (which is
today a rare thing happening anywhere in rural Pakistan) has
been made so overwhelming that it appears to be the story of
every feudal's daughter in the countryside. This may be
extended to Md. Mahmudul Hasan's (2005) thesis of the ore-
intalization of gender, as he critiques the tendency of charac-
terizing the women from the East as backward, domesticized,
tradition-bound, ignorant and poor. Such caricaturing was
long ago initiated by the West and is now kept in continuum
by both the Western and Eastern writers. This homogeniza-
tion and essentialization of the women of postcolonial
nations is what one may regard as part of the oreintalization-
of-gender project. It is on account of such notions that one,
while reading texts like Shahraz's The Holy Woman, must
see whether these establish the authors as native "infor-
mants" or "informers." This is for such writers, as argued by
Dabashi (2011), may prove an assistance to the imperialist
project in substituting the "black demon with a brown one
and a Jew with a Muslim" (p. 36).
It is popularly upheld that many of the writers, especially
with diasporic or postcolonial identity, write for the Western
audience. This carries the reservation that such works may
ascribe normative value to Western standards of looking at
and criticizing the non-Western cultures and lifestyles.
Shahraz's cultural narratology in her The Holy Woman may
be seen in light of her reflection on the Western conception
of Muslim cultural identity. Kidwai (2011) however puts for-
ward the idea that The Holy Woman can be read in the larger
context of globalization and modernity with respect to con-
ventional Muslim rural society of Pakistan. It can be safely
argued that the main plot dwelling on Zari Bano's marriage
with the Quran in The Holy Woman unavoidably creates sen-
sationalism. Shahraz's reporting on the cultural realities of
rural Pakistan carry an essential resonance of violence, a fact
which may endanger her position as a cultural critic. Her
plots are featured by melodrama too, something which may
arguably posit her as a "native informer." Men, in Shahraz's
world, both jeopardize women's destinies (in case of Habib
Khan and Siraj Din in The Holy Woman) as well as rescue
them (in case of Haroon in Typhoon). Critically speaking,
this further stamps women's helplessness, making them
more subalternized and adding to their othering thus sub-
scribing to the orientalization of gender as discussed by
Hasan (2005). Nonetheless, her way of looking at Islam as a
remedy to all these and many other socio-domestic problems
(as can be seen through her fiction and interviews) is what
establishes her as a Muslim feminist who refuses to be part of
the contemporary Islamphobia.
A simple subscription to Dabashi's critique of the role of
brown authors as "native informers" essentially carries a
question: Just out of the fear of betraying one's inherited
legacy, should one stop speaking the truth? Shahraz's work
may be orientalist in the representation of Pakistani women's
situation in the postcolonial rural context. It exposes the feu-
dal lord acting as a surrogate to the departed colonizer thus
becoming the indigenous colonial bourgeois. Moreover, it
may be too excessive a portrayal of fatalism on the part of
women like Zari Bano who are remarkably urbanized in their
approach toward life. Nevertheless, all this is countered and
then nullified in the face of Shahraz's foregrounding of Islam
as the ultimate authority in every facet of life among
Muslims. To illustrate, Zari Bano, Shahraz's protagonist in
The Holy Woman, has been placed at the center of a situation
where Islam has been shown misappropriated to the maxi-
mum. Certainly, religious values affect cultural beliefs and
practices and vice versa as religion is a discursive tradition
which is always already relived and embedded in relations of
power in the society. Declaring religion key to history,
Dawson believes it to be a life-giving force which shapes the
dynamism of not only a culture but also determines various
social classes that feature a society (Dawson, 2013, p. 38).
The problem nevertheless occurs when customary tribal
practices are confused with religion (in this case Islam) for
appropriating power relations in favor of men. The worst of
the worst comes when these tribal or folk practices are legiti-
mized and ritualized in the name of religion. This may in fact
be taken as an effort on the author's part to defend Islam's
position which, in its episteme, is considered misogynist.
This article aims at laying bare the dangerous chemistry
of religion and tradition as designed against women in feudal
hierarchies in particular and postcolonial rural set ups in gen-
eral. The Holy Woman by Qaisra Shahraz stands as a repre-
sentative text in this connection as it highlights the way
religion is wrongfully twisted into the melting pot of tradi-
tional ritual, something which is bound to serve the andro-
centric order prevailing in places like rural Pakistan. In this
Ishaque 3
connection, issues like female sexuality, enforced celibacy
and hijab surface through Shahraz's novel. Nevertheless,
what is needed is an endeavor to probe into the kind of space
granted by Islam to its female followers, something, which
has unfortunately been made to subsume into misogyny.
Review of Related Literature
Discourse on gender in Islam is indeed not a new subject.
Nonetheless, even an extensive search tells one that it is hard
to find literature that exists on gender and Islam in exclusive
relation to literature. In the context of Muslim female per-
spective appearing in literature, Women Claim Islam by
Miriam Cooke (2001) is a rare yet seminal contribution. The
book revisits literature, fiction and memoirs by contempo-
rary Muslim feminist authors while focusing how these
women through their narrative and social activity have chal-
lenged their being ruled out of the discourses on religion,
war, history, exile and emigration. The book offers the devel-
opment of a whole episteme of a gendered ideology based on
Islam which questions patriarchy and male authority at
indigenous levels (in terms of the interpretation of the Islamic
doctrine) as well as the biased and colonial narratives about
Muslim women. The book serves twofold purposes: It histo-
ricizes Islamic feminism and analyzes the fiction and autobi-
ographies of Arab Muslim women writers as different as
Nawal El Saadawi and Zaynab al-Ghazali.
Diah Ariani Arimbi's (2009) Reading Contemporary
Indonesian Muslim Women Writers looks at the writings of
popular Indonesian Muslim women authors in relation to
how gender is constructed and in turns determines the roles,
status and identity of the Muslim women in the Muslim soci-
ety of Indonesia. For Arimbi, literary representation in
Indonesia has now become one of the many ways through
which women carve out their own ways for looking at their
own selves. It is thus a medium portraying women's strate-
gies to take maximum control of their lives and bodies. The
book serves a number of purposes: First, it projects how
gender-related issues are brought forth in the narratives of
contemporary Muslim women writers in Indonesia; second,
it shows how Muslim women of Indonesia are shown in
these narratives; third, it investigates a variety of aesthetic
styles and narrative structures while recognizing how issues
of aesthetics are intertwined inseparably with those of gender
construction, identity, power, representation, and prevailing
religious ideology; and finally, it investigates how these nar-
ratives by Indonesian Muslim women authors have sus-
tained, challenged, worked, and reworked the perceptions,
roles, and status of women in the Muslim societies.
Such a woman-centric sensibility takes one on a journey
to reading Qaisra Shahraz's The Holy Woman. Sana Imtiaz
and Shirin Haider (2011) discuss the recolonization of the
female mind and body by ritualizing violence. They also
address the structure of representation of the female charac-
ters in Shahraz's The Holy Woman. To Imtiaz and Haider, the
process of making a woman "holy" is part of colonial behav-
ior which involves ritual for legitimizing violence. Ironically,
the protagonist Zari Bano in Shahraz's text materializes her
free will and negates androcentricity by accepting confine-
ment and giving up her rights as a woman. Becoming "holy"
is synonymous to being devoid of any physical, bodily, or
emotional needs. Nevertheless, being a woman adds more to
this so-called "holiness" - a fact bound to culminate in the
supposed passivity of the female sex. To Imtiaz and Haider,
the politics of representation and issue of gender are inter-
twined thus shaping the spirit of Shahraz's text.
Discussing Shahraz's themes and concerns, Sherin
Shervani (2011) asserts that Shahraz mainly addresses the
issues featuring contemporary society. She is highly con-
scious of the relation of such issues with the norms of Islam.
Sherani appreciates Shehraz's texts in the sense that they
encapsulate the severity and complexity of simple lives of
the people in the countryside in Pakistan. However, Shahraz
is also interested in the metamorphosis of life and fate which
may give out horrific experiences. Shahraz manages to direct
her protagonist to an Islamic stance ironically by means of an
old feudal norm (marriage with the Quran) which is most
unIslamic in itself. Maintaining the balance between the
problems of the present-day world and a Muslim perspec-
tive, Shahraz welcomes Islamic values as a remedy to the
problems plaguing the contemporary Muslim world today.
Kidwai (2011) establishes that the "newly emerging
Muslim woman of our time" is what is most characteristic of
Shahraz's cultural narratology in The Holy Woman (p. 85).
Shahraz, in a most dexterous manner, makes the old order
collapse under its own weight. This naturally helps synchro-
nize the lives and situations of Pakistani women in relation to
modernity and globalization. To illustrate, Zari Bano turns
her suffering (of being pushed into the role of a holy woman)
into an enlightening experience since becoming a holy
woman ironically exempts her from the traditional roles (of
wife and mother) and gives her liberty to travel and study
abroad. It is from her study in Egypt that she learns the real-
ity of Islam in terms of the space it grants to women. What,
according to Kidwai, adds more to the place of a Muslim
woman in Shahraz's text is the fact that the women in her
world tend to acquire their rightful position while avoiding
the "hysterical harangue against the clergy" (p. 81).
Referring to Shahraz's The Holy Woman, Abu Bakar Ali
(2013) reminds his readers that Muslim nationalism and its
consciousness are remarkably significant for Pakistani
females. They aptly respond to the challenges proposed by
this religion-based ideology, especially in terms of its impli-
cations for the gendered agency. While one talks of popular
mass media in Pakistan, ranging from television drama to
printed fiction, romance is the pivot of everything. In case of
Sharhaz's The Holy Woman, however, romance goes even
beyond the limits ascribed to it. Today, the genre of romance
is providing a platform where Pakistani women writers are
codifying and reconfiguring their potential part that they
4 SAGE Open
may play in the nationalist milieu. Shahraz, through her
novel, expresses her concerns against the manipulation of
these nationalistic and cultural politics which put themselves
into practice across the lives and bodies of the women of
rural Sindh in Pakistan. The intricacies of religion, gender,
culture, and sex (which are inscribed on Zari Bano's body)
can thus be studied well in this regard, especially in unison
with the complexities of representation.
Ali Ahmed Kharal (2007) appreciates Shahraz's art as a
novelist as she effectively brings forth her characters to the
centre-stage. It is through her female characters that Shahraz
speaks for the female sensibility and consciousness of their
rights among women. Her women characters assert their will
by cutting loose the limitations, which circumcise the lives
of Pakistani women. This acts as a marker of a change for the
ill-fated women of rural Pakistan as it allows them at least
some breathing space in a social order which is clearly
misogynistic.
Controlled Female Sexuality and the
Politics of Misogyny
Shahraz's text is essentially a saga of the politics of female
sexuality which is manipulated and perpetuated against
women's bodies especially in rural Pakistan. This is done
both at familial and public levels as can be seen in Shahraz's
novel where the men surrounding Zari Bano in her family are
all inclined to control her sexuality both before and after her
marriage with the Quran. The story revolves around the trag-
edy, which befalls Habib Khan (Zari's father) and his family
when his only son and heir to his estate passes away in an
accident. Zari is the eldest of Habib Khan's three children
whose education at university in Karachi has made her bold
enough to decide about her marriage independently, though
this too turns out to be illusory later. Habib Khan receives a
marriage proposal for Zari by young and eligible Sikander
who happens to like Zari the moment he sees her.
Nevertheless, Zari's decision to visit and stay at Sikander's
house (with an aim to know him in person before deciding to
marry) is no less than a thunderbolt for her aged grandfather
Siraj Din (Habib Khan's father) who considers Zari's actions
abhorring as he pronounces this to Shahzada (Zari's mother):
"Are you telling me, Shahzada, that my young unmarried
granddaughter has gone to stay all alone on a strange fami-
ly's home and is in the company of a single young man?"
(Shahraz, 2001, p. 23). Shahraz depicts the situation of a
young daughter in a kind of family where a girl cannot take
charge of her will regarding marriage before her elders, espe-
cially the male ones. Habib Khan decides to wed Zari with
the Quran after the death of Jafar, his only son. He does this
following the feudal tradition of "haqbakhshawana" (girls'
marriage with the Quran for withholding land and estate
which are considered fundamental for the dignity and socio-
economic survival of Pakistani feudal elite). This enables
Zari to act as a proxy to Jafar since marrying the Quran
means celibacy for the rest of her life. Habib Khan takes the
decision in consultation with Siraj Din since the stratagem of
the Pakistani feudal families believes in withholding the
estate through their male heirs. In absence of a male heir,
therefore, the entire estate goes away with girls once they are
married (as Islam gives property rights to women). Zari Bano
is thus ordained to become "shehzadi ibadat" or a holy
woman. Unfortunately, all this is achieved in the name of
tradition which, in a most unjust manner, conspires with
patriarchy under the shelter of religion. Thus, one sees Zari's
wedding with the Quran as the only "culturally legitimate"
way Habib could save his ancestral estate slipping out of his
hands. Sikander, on the contrary, is forced by his parents to
marry Zari's younger sister Ruby who is lucky enough not to
spend a life of celibacy unlike her elder sister. Sikander
unwillingly marries Ruby but develops frustration against
Zari for succumbing to the gruesome order of her family.
Zari Bano clearly knows what it means to be a holy
woman. She fears a life of celibacy and being a Muslim fully
owns her right to get married and that too with her own con-
sent. Habib knows how to repress her voice and restrain her
sexuality by putting her down in a most embarrassing man-
ner. The shared values between the father and the daughter
make Zari Bano succumb to her father's order. Being mar-
ried is a foil for "holiness" and this is what Habib enforces
upon his daughter. Zari, on the contrary, launches her humble
protest against this:
I want to be a normal woman, Father, and live a normal life! I
want to get married! I am not a very religious person, as you
know. I am a twentieth century, modern, educated woman. I am
not living in the Mughal period--a pawn in a game of male
chess. Don't you see, Father, I have hardly ever prayed in my
life, nor opened the Holy Quran on a regular basis. How can I
thus become a Holy Woman? I am not suited to that role.
(Shahraz, 2001, p. 62)
And Habib's pungent response to her appeals goes in
these words: "What you are trying to say is that you want a
man in your life" (Shahraz, 2001, p. 62). He pressurizes her
further by putting her into the same mold of tradition and
blood ties which ensnare nearly every Pakistani woman:
You can shout as much as you like, my proud, beloved daughter,
but you will do as I say--I know you will. We are two of a kind.
You will never let me down, I know, nor our traditions, nor your
grandfather. If you cannot abide by my decision, at least think of
your grandfather. (Shahraz, 2001, p. 63)
It is evident that Habib perpetuates his patriarchal and
misogynist order on the body, mind, and soul of his daughter.
He, on account of his position as a father and authority as a
feudal lord, successfully attaches the concept of honor to the
dismissal and negation of the bodily side of his daughter's
being. It is Habib's remark of desiring for a man which com-
pels Zari Bano to give up. He exploits her womanly self by
Ishaque 5
assaulting her ego. Furthermore, a lot of manipulation is
done in the name of religion. As Fatima Mernissi (1987)
imparts awareness to her readers about these situations while
drawing upon history and concludes that,
Not only the sacred texts have been manipulated, but the
manipulation of them is the structural characteristic of the
practice of power in Muslim societies. So all power, from the
seventh century on, was only legitimized by religion, political
forces and economic interests pushed for the fabrication of false
traditions. (p. 9)
Zari Bano's marriage with the Quran is an idea which
finds absolutely no space in Islam. Habib Khan considers the
rejection of this tyranny as the betrayal of values and blood.
From a structuralist point of view, one feels the compulsion
of looking at the word "holy" in terms of its opposite which
is "unholy." From this standpoint, it is the latter of the binary
which defines and qualifies the former. It is therefore Habib's
emphasis on a woman's desire for marriage or man which
makes Zari highly conscious of becoming "unholy" in the
eyes of her father. And indeed, it is this fear of "unholy"
which in turn convinces her to take up the life of a "holy"
woman. So, it is the fear of becoming "unholy" in her father's
eyes to which Zari succumbs. Jafar's (Zari's brother) death is
an irreparable loss to the family. Habib and his father Siraj
Din look at the tragedy in terms of the demise of not only
their child but also that of their feudal domain. The fear of
losing the inheritance by making their daughter marry is an
act which is "unholy." Lands, to the feudal hierarchy, are as
sacred as mothers, as it is commonly said and believed
among feudal and land owners in Pakistan that, "Selling
away one's lands is tantamount to selling away one's mother."
It is again the horror of the "unholy" which makes Zari
Bano exercise a strict control over her own sexuality. Her jour-
ney to becoming a holy woman can be critically seen in two
distinct phases. The first phase entails her struggle against her
coded and emblematic disposition as the most devout woman.
This is the period when she strives to reclaim her right to mar-
riage. The latter phase, which develops after her journey and
study abroad, brings out the side of her character she herself is
never aware of. It is in this phase that Zari Bano confronts and
then learns how to control her sexuality. Initially, this control
had been something not more than an imposition on her by her
father. Later, however, the same control becomes the articula-
tion of her liberty and free will, both as a woman and a scholar
of Islam. Zari Bano is driven by this control so much so that
she shows reluctance in running a normal matrimonial relation
even after her marriage with Sikander. She is afraid of the
bodily drives she experiences and so prays to Allah:
Allah pak, please heed the prayers of a weak woman, a sinner.
Guide me back on to Your path of peace and religious devotion.
Tear out this ugly human emotion that is renting me apart and
torturing my soul. Douse this longing, that fire that is engulfing
my body. I am supposed to be a pure woman. How can I be that
while I harbor such base feelings? Enfold me in Your holy
mantle of female modesty. Rid my mind and heart of this man
who haunts me at this moment. Show me Your path; for that is
the path I seek. (Shahraz, 2001, p. 186)
From a cultural point of view, as Aslam (2005) asserts,
lives of women in Pakistan always remain subject to issues of
morality and immorality. Thus, Pakistani women fear their
own sexuality. They do this to obtain social acceptance,
something denied to them if they act otherwise. This is what
is evident in Zari Bano's character also. Her past as a feminist
demonstrating resistance to the patriarchal order of her soci-
ety is altogether a contradiction to what she takes up later in
her life--a life of enforced celibacy and religious devotion.
Shahraz's text is in fact defensive in its composition. She is
not only vocal about how women's lives are encroached upon
in the name of tradition and religion but also brings into lime-
light the global perspective upheld about Muslim women in
general and those in Pakistan in particular.This is for Muslims,
all over the world, believe Islam to be not only a code of faith
but also a complete code of life. For Kharal (2007), Shahraz's
text significantly marks the change that has already been
there all over the world, that is, the question of women rights
and their status. This is achieved effectively by her protago-
nist by challenging the constraints imposed by gender biases
upon a woman's will and life.
Female Celibacy
The Holy Woman presents a certain dialectic process ongoing
between the "oppressor" and the "oppressed" (Imtiaz &
Haider, 2011). This can be seen in terms of a dialogic rela-
tionship between the two where the oppressed is traditionally
supposed to be mute or passive. Shahraz, however, develops
her characters in a way that the oppressed challenge and
question the way they are treated. This is for the binaries of
subject and object share each other's qualities. This encour-
ages the oppressed to hold the oppressor at least ethically
accountable for all his wrongdoings. In addition to this, it
also creates a kind of hope since the oppressed are somehow
in a position to at least question the injustices done to them.
This is especially true in the case of women who are canoni-
cally believed to be doubly disadvantaged.
Kristen Holst and Ana Rutherford (1986) use the term
"double colonization" while referring to the destiny of women
who simultaneously undergo the tyranny inflicted by the col-
onizer and patriarchy. There is an entire series of male-ori-
ented myths which, according to Holst and Rutherford, are
celebrated by colonialism. These include missionaries, mate-
ship, freedom fighters, and so on. This establishes the fact that
women are twice enslaved as long as the colonizer sustains
who even perpetuates the tyranny by transferring his powers
to the indigenous patriarchal order. Gayatri Spivak's (1988)
Can the Subaltern Speak? provoked a massive response
which Spivak (1996) discusses in The Spivak Reader. The
6 SAGE Open
word "speak," as used in her essay, has been commonly mis-
understood. Spivak suggests that the usage of the word does
not imply that women never actually talked. What Spivak
tends to highlight is the failure of their words to conduct
"transaction" between the speaker and the listener.
Now when it comes to the relationship between gender and
subalternity, one of the constructs in operation has been reli-
gion. Religion is one of the constituents subsumed by culture as
a macroscopic entity. Whereas religion draws its energy from
culture and vice versa, gender is dependent on both culture and
religion. While qualifying culture, Kuper (1999) takes it as "a
way of talking about collective identities" (p. 3). Culture pri-
marily owes to what is indigenously sound and credible and the
way people are organized. It is generally believed by the post-
modernists that gender is the product of the normative behavior
demonstrated toward men and women by culture and religion.
The history of religion (especially the monolithic religion) and
the traditional culture gives out stories of subordination of
women to men. Traditional and religious practices are academ-
ically separable though they do interact and overlap each other
invariably. This is what occurs in Shahraz's text where misog-
yny and patriarchy, especially in rural Pakistan, are legitimized
in the name of tradition and religion.
The tradition of "haqbakhshawana" is what Zari Bano's
life orbits around. This entails the authority demonstrated by
the feudal class over their daughters and other women of
family to keep the feudal legacy preserved within the family,
especially in case of the absence of a male heir. This is how
Habib Khan justifies his wrongdoings he intends to commit
against his own daughter in the name of tradition:
Well, now that I have no son, who is going to be my heir,
Shahzada? To whom am I going to bequeath all this land? I am
not going to hand it over to some stranger who just happens to
marry my daughter. This is our land, accumulated and paid for
by the sweat and toil of my forefathers, down the centuries by
different generations. Tell me what would you do in my position?
(Shahraz, 2001, p. 47)
Sikander, in the course of his argument with Zari Bano,
tends to explain this injustice. The same religion which is
exploited to tyrannize women in fact gives them the right to
live and choose. Sikander's words actually hold a mirror to
the tradition-bound Pakistani society. He places the man-
made culture in opposition to the revealed word, thus expos-
ing the horrors of the former:
Holy Quran! What nonsense is this? No woman is to be denied her
natural role as a wife and a mother. Who has invented these
traditions? Have they studied the Holy Quran, where it categorically
states that widows and divorcees should be encouraged to remarry
at the first opportunity? So how can a beautiful young maiden be
deliberately denied marriage? (The Holy Woman, p. 89)
Ironically, Zari Bano is fully conscious of the rights given
to her by Islam as a woman. Yet, what seems to be more
important is to abide by all that has been decided by the males
of her family. Even in her freedom, Zari Bano experiences
subjugation as she cannot succumb to the idea of the denial of
her right to marry. Zari refers to the "pinjra" (cage) in which
all women are destined to live. The key of this cage stays in
the hands of fathers or other male members of the family.
Zari's pain aggravates as she is fully aware of the rights her
religion has given to her. This creates irony as Zari Bano, who
herself is denied the fundamental rights by her family,
explains what position Islam reserves for women. Zari Bano's
identity as a holy woman, when seen as a subject-constitutive
reality, brings out a number of facts that feature the complex
hermeneutics of religion in relation with identity, space and
sexuality of the female. It is her father who ascribes the status
of holy woman to her. Zari Bano is thereof exposed to a situ-
ation where her elevation accounts for her subjugation. This
dichotomy subverts the subject position Zari Bano proclaims
in general. Habib, her father, articulates the expected out-
comes of her so-called sacred position where one finds ritual
in conspiracy with tradition and a society which is both com-
plex and hypocritical. Michel Focault's famous proposition
that knowledge is a product of power fits right into this situa-
tion. Pakistani women are hardly aware of what rights they
enjoy being Muslim women. This particularly owes to our
passivity as women never try to acquire any knowledge of
Sharia' (Islamic law). However, it also alludes to the role of
Pakistani males, especially the scholars on religion. who
never let the body of knowledge out which favors women.
Veil: A Mechanism of Serving or
Dismantling Patriarchy
Mookherjee (2005), on the issue of hijab and veiling, holds the
view that it involves certain controversy as it deals with two
problems of distinct nature. The issue arises from both feminist
and postcolonial camps, respectively.As for the feminist stand-
point, women and young girls, in no way, must be forced to
conform to any community's religious or conventional norms.
In terms of a postcolonial perspective, however, the increasing
focus on hijab is a matter of establishing biases against
Muslim value systems. Mookherjee further refers to Elizabeth
Badinter's (1989) universal feminist concern about the possi-
bilities of female subjugation within the cultural communities.
In her debate over the headscarf issue of the young girls in
France, she holds the view that the choice of adopting veil is
synonymous to giving up one's individual and personal auton-
omy. She asserts that even if the Muslim girls take veiling as
an expression of their autonomy, they are abiding by the
Muslim values of female restraint, confinement and modesty.
Badinter however fails to penetrate the spirit and episteme
leading the Muslim women to cover their heads and bodies.
Mojab (2001) discusses the policing of women's bodies as a
prominent site of debate for both feminism and postcolonial-
sim. The idea of liberal recognition, favorite with the Western
Ishaque 7
discourses is problematic when put under the postcolonial lens
as, " . . . it often presumes a stable world of public meanings
and symbols. It relies on a settled public private distinction
which frequently fails to engage with the third world women's
struggle for emancipation" (Mookherjee, 2005, p. 2). Mojab
(2001) quotes Hoodfar (1994) who presents a relativist view on
the veiling of Muslim women:
The veil, which since the nineteenth century has symbolized for
the West the inferiority of Muslim cultures, remains a powerful
symbol both for the West and for Muslim societies . . . Veiling is
a lived experience full of contradictions and multiple meanings.
While it has clearly been a mechanism in the service of
patriarchy, a means of regulating and controlling women's lives,
women have used the same social institution to free themselves
from the bonds of patriarchy. (p. 5)
For Zari Bano and her status as a holy woman, veil serves
multiple purposes. To illustrate, her marriage ceremony calls
for the bride to dress up with splendor and then cover this
splendor with veil. This carries a certain symbolism suggest-
ing the split of personality and the role Zari Bano is put into.
She surrenders her womanhood and even matrimony by get-
ting married to the Quran. Zari Bano, in her exasperation,
cuts the locks of her hair which is a declaration of her readi-
ness to be a combatant in the politics of power and changing
of roles. However, she shifts back to her female self (some-
thing she has never been able to give up completely) at the
wedding ceremony of her sister Ruby where she dances with
other girls while going against her role of a holy woman. Zari
Bano's identity is thus fluid and remains in constant flux.
Zari Bano once again falls prey to the schism of her per-
sonality after her marriage with Sikander. She is indecisive
about what to wear as it becomes difficult for her to cope
with "marriage." She does not know whether she should
wear dull colors as she used to 5 years ago or the pastel
shades when now she is married:
Until now, I have gone everywhere in my burqa; now I am
requested to discard it at home. I am so used to the burqa, feel so
totally happy and safe behind it, Mother that without it I feel
naked and disoriented, very conscious of my body and its shape.
(Shahraz, 2001, p. 347)
Zari Bano successfully recodes veil as a means of transcen-
dence from the spatial boundary it conceptually and tradition-
ally connotes for women. Ali (2013) lays stress on the need to
look whether Shahraz's text "[A]cts as a spring board for a vis-
ible (re) configuration" (p. 197). As a matter of fact, it is the
"veiled" persona of Zari Bano which "enlightens" her so much
so that she dares to interrogate her formerly "liberal" position.
Her veiling essentially challenges her vanity she carried with
her and which was no more than a site serving the sexually
charged gaze of the males in her society. Unfortunately, how-
ever, Zari's new role also serves the same patriarchy, which
she willfully negates by shunning her vanity. Her shrouded
appearance materializes the socio-capitalist motivations of her
father Habib Khan which are tactfully given the garb of reli-
gion. Therefore, "The role Zari Bano now occupies is one that
is consciously aware of the precondition of its feudal existence,
where myth cannot transcend its own materiality" (Ali, 2013,
p. 198). With her veiled identity, Zari happens to visit Egypt,
England and the Far East as a student and an ambassador of
religion. It is thus interesting to note here how the capitalistic
and feudal motives get turned on their own heads and impart
Zari the same authority which had been denied to her. She
comes to embrace and internalize her veiled identity as a reli-
giously rooted opportunity. This gives a political nuance to her
position as a holy woman which, at the same time, also empow-
ers her. Patriarchy thus comes to betray itself as Zari Bano tri-
umphantly closes the circle of misogyny. And so the readers
see how the same patriarchy, compelling Zari dump her essen-
tial female sexuality, betrays itself as she refuses to marry
Sikander (for the sake of Ruby's young son after her death) on
account of being a "holy woman." Even later, when she con-
cedes to her elders'requests to marry Sikander, she agrees thor-
oughly on her own terms. Subscribing to her position as a
veiled priestess, Zari first gives up her body and sexuality and
reclaims it later. Sikander is denied any sexual access (which
every man considers his foremost right) for a considerably long
time after his marriage with Zari Bano. In fact to Zari Bano,
hijab blesses her with a sense of self-worth, dignity and respect.
She dauntlessly criticizes the West for its critique on hijab:
The veil has always perplexed and tantalized the Western world,
both men and women alike. It is a disconcerting phenomenon
for them as much now as it ever was. Westerners have always
misunderstood the reason why women wear it. To add insult to
injury, they see it as a symbol of male oppression--a widely
accepted stereotyped myth. They think that women are forced to
wear it by their menfolk. (Shahraz, 2001, p. 220)
Conclusion
Shahraz's narrative reflects on the dangerous chemistry of
religion and tribal tradition especially when it is manipulated
against women. It also proposes balance and understanding
between Islam and the modern, day-to-day realities of human
life, especially that of Muslim women. The orientalist biases
established against Islam as a religion and Muslims as a peo-
ple can be countered only if the scholarship on Islam is just
and unprejudiced. Muslim women, from across the globe,
form an unavoidable part of this polemics. This implicitly
emphasizes that they must equip themselves with the stance
upheld by Sharia' as Islam does not comprise only a set of
rituals to be followed; it rather establishes itself as a com-
plete code of life where there are clear-cut specifications of
what status each of the two sexes enjoys, respectively, in
terms of social position and interpersonal relationships.
Shahraz's cultural critique on the rural Sindh in Pakistan
essentially brings the woman question and female space as it
8 SAGE Open
exists in an unbreakable relation with the looming postcolo-
niality. Her female characters like Zari Bano are the conspic-
uous reminders of how women can be the combatants for
their own rights and learn to survive both within the tribal or
indigenous order and the global plane they are part of. The
relation between tradition and religion, especially when
placed within the postcolonial order, gives out circumstances
which are generally designed against women thus naturally
favoring men. The need therefore is to reconsider and revisit
the relation that exists between the tribal and the religious.
This is what is likely to guarantee some breathing space for
women like Zari Bano who experience intense suffocation
when violence or tyranny is ritualized in the name of religion
in places like rural Pakistan.
