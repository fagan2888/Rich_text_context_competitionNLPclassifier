gastrointestinal tract as a central organ driving remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The main points considered in the study's design and challenges
faced in its application are detailed.
Methods: This observational, longitudinal, prospective study involved collection of gastrointes-
tinal biopsy specimens, faeces, urine, and blood from 25 obese women with T2DM who were
candidates for RYGB (20 patients for omics assessment and 5 for omics validation). These
collections were performed preoperatively and 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Gastrointestinal
transcriptomics; faecal metagenomics and metabolomics; plasma proteomics, lipidomics, and
metabolomics; and biochemical, nutritional, and metabolic data were assessed to identify their
short- and long-term correlations with T2DM remission.
Results: Data were collected from 20 patients before and 3 months after RYGB. These patients
have nearly completed the 2-year follow-up assessments. The five additional patients are currently
being selected for omics data validation.
Conclusion: The multi-integrated pan-omics approach of the SURMetaGIT study enables
integrated analysis of data that will contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms
involved in T2DM remission after RYGB.

Introduction
Obesity, a condition characterized by exces-
sive body fat accumulation, has reached
epidemic levels worldwide.1 Excessive
adipose tissue is associated with several
obesity-related comorbidities that may lead
to early death, including dyslipidaemia, type
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hyperten-
sion.1,2 Because primary care involving diet-
ary and lifestyle modifications often cannot
be implemented in the long term, bariatric
surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment
currently available for severe obesity.2,3
Compared with primary clinical care, BS
substantially reduces morbidity and mortality
associated with excessive body weight.4 The
American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric
Surgery reported that approximately 179,000
BS procedures were performed in 2013,
34.2% of which were performed using
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).5 RYGB
combines stomach restriction with intestinal
malabsorption, enabling effective and sustain-
able weight loss.6
Obese patients with T2DM may experi-
ence short-term glucose homeostasis after
RYGB, often before significant weight loss;
normal postoperative plasma glucose levels
were observed in 30% of patients after an
average of 2.8 days of hospitalization.7 A
meta-analysis showed full remission of
T2DM after BS in 76.8% of 22,094 patients.8
Higher rates (83%) of T2DM control and
remission have been obtained with proced-
ures that include gastrointestinal (GI) bypass,
such as RYGB.7,9 However, other studies
have revealed long-term T2DM recurrence
rates ranging from 17% to 68%, the main
predictors of which include a longer pre-
operative T2DM duration, a small amount of
excess weight loss, and postoperative weight
regain.10­12
The restrictive and malabsorptive aspects
of RYGB may explain the postoperative
body weight loss, but they do not fully
1360 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
explain the metabolic effect of RYGB on
short-term T2DM remission or long-term
recurrence. We hypothesized that RYGB-
induced anatomic GI changes modify
GI metabolic functions, thereby affecting
systemic metabolism. The small intestine is a
neuroendocrine organ that expresses more
than 30 gene-encoding hormones under
several cell-signalling pathways and pro-
duces hundreds of bioactive peptides that
participate in food control and glycaemic
homeostasis.13,14 Experimentally, RYGB-
induced anatomic changes have been
shown to modify intestinal gene-encoding
hormone expression, in turn affecting glu-
cose metabolism.15 Another consequence of
intestinal anatomic changes is alteration of
the resident microbiota, which appears to
influence a wide range of diseases including
obesity and T2DM.16 After RYGB,
increased richness of the intestinal micro-
biota was observed and found to be asso-
ciated with changes in white adipose tissue
gene expression.17 This observation suggests
a possible role of intestinal bacteria as
drivers of postoperative metabolic effects.
Multifactorial mechanisms can thus
influence the metabolic effects potentially
induced by RYGB, implying the need for a
multi-integrated study approach. We are
conducting a prospective clinical study to
examine whether T2DM remission after
RYGB is driven by postoperative changes
in GI ``omic'' functions. The SURgically
induced Metabolic effects on the Human
GastroIntestinal Tract (SURMetaGIT)
study considers the human GI tract to be a
central organ driving RYGB-induced meta-
bolic effects, including not only TD2M
remission and recurrence but also improve-
ment or worsening (e.g., micronutrient
deficiency) of other obesity-associated
comorbidities. The main challenges faced
in the development of our protocol were
minimization of patient risk associated with
biopsy collections and identification of key
associations between postoperative GI
transcriptomic changes and local and sys-
temic responses related to surgically induced
metabolic effects. With the intent of facil-
itating researchers' performance of studies
involving multi-integrated analysis, this art-
icle describes the design of the
SURMetaGIT protocol and discusses how
we have overcome these challenges. We also
present the initial results of the patient
selection and data collection, which reflect
the success achieved by the practical appli-
cation of this protocol.
Patients and methods
Study design
The SURMetaGIT study is an obser-
vational, longitudinal, prospective study
testing the general hypothesis that RYGB-
induced anatomic alterations modify GI
function as an adaptive mechanism that
affects systemic metabolism. The study
protocol comprises several steps to con-
junctly investigate associations between
potential RYGB-induced changes in GI
gene expression and postoperative bio-
markers related to improvement or worsening
of obesity-associated comorbidities, mainly
T2DM remission. The SURMetaGIT study
was approved by the local ethics committee
(CAPPesq1011/09) and registered at
Plataforma Brasil (19339913.0.0000.0068)
and www.clinicalTrials.gov (NCT01251016).
The protocol is currently being implemented;
the steps completed and those still in the
process of completion are shown in Figure 1.
Patient selection
Patients were recruited from the Surgical
Gastroenterology Department of the
Hospital das Cli´nicas at the Medical
School of the University of Sa
~ o Paulo
(HC-FMUSP) according to the following
inclusion criteria: female sex (approximately
80% of patients undergoing BS at HC-
FMUSP are female), age of 18 to 60 years,
Sala et al. 1361
established diagnosis of T2DM (fasting glu-
cose concentration of ! 126 mg/dL and
glycated haemoglobin level of !6.5%) and/
or use of an oral antidiabetic drug, body
mass index of !35 kg/m2, candidacy for
RYGB, absence of a diagnosis of GI
Helicobacter pylori infection, and interest
in and availability for study participation.
The exclusion criteria were refusal to par-
ticipate in the study, use of insulin, diagnosis
of thyroid or hepatic disease, candidacy for
another BS procedure, antibiotic use in the
month preceding faecal material collection,
probiotic and/or prebiotic use, dementia and
other cognitive and behavioural problems,
and current or recent participation in
another interventional study protocol.
Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient prior to participation in
the trial.
Primary and secondary endpoints
The primary endpoints of the SURMetaGIT
study are potential changes in the expression
of GI genes that may affect glucose
homeostasis and contribute to the short-
term remission of T2DM observed following
RYGB. To determine whether such changes
occur, the protocol involves assessment of the
transcriptomic profiles of GI biopsy speci-
mens before and at 3 and 24 months after
RYGB to test their correlations with the
following systemic and local data obtained at
the same time points: a) systemic (plasma or
serum) biochemical and hormonal markers
of glucose homeostasis, b) plasma proteomic
profiles, c) plasma lipidomic profiles, d)
plasma and 24-h urine metabolomic profiles,
e) faecal microbiota profiles, and f) faecal
water profiles.
The study was designed to examine several
hypothesis-generating secondary endpoints
related to the improvement or worsening of
obesity-associated metabolic comorbidities
other than T2DM in the short term and
T2DM recurrence in the long term. For
instance, obesity is associated with nutri-
tional deficiencies and changes in body com-
position that may affect health and can be
aggravated or improved after RYGB.18,19
We thus planned to examine potential

associations of postoperative changes in GI
gene expression with the following nutritional,
metabolic, body composition, and energy
expenditure markers assessed at the same
time points: a) nutritional intake, b) compart-
mental body composition, c) indirect calorim-
etry, and d) other clinical measurements.
BS. All patients underwent standardized
RYGB without silicon rings and with bilio-
pancreatic (50 ­ 60 cm) and alimentary (100
­ 120 cm) limbs. RYGB reduces the stomach
volume by creating a proximal gastric pouch
with a capacity of approximately 30 mL,
excluding the rest of the stomach, duode-
num, and proximal jejunum from the flow of
nutrients. After RYGB, about 95% of
ingested food bypasses the stomach, the
entire duodenum, and a short portion of
the jejunum (Figure 2).
Double-balloon enteroscopy for GI biopsies.
Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) was per-
formed at the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
Unit of HC-FMUSP about 1 week before
and 3 and 24 months after RYGB. Before
DBE, the patients fasted for 12h and
abstained from diabetes medication for 3
to 5 days. Briefly, each patient was placed in
the left lateral position under deep sedation,
achieved with 1 mg/kg of fentanyl (Fentanest;
Crista
´ lia, Sa
~ o Paulo, Brazil), 5 min before
anaesthetic induction. For anaesthesia, we
applied our institution's standardized proto-
col for severely obese individuals as follows:
dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Hospira, Lake
Figure 2. Anatomic changes induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. (a) Intact gastrointestinal
tract and (b) anatomic rearrangement of gastrointestinal tract after RYGB.
Sala et al. 1363
Forest, IL, USA) was administered at
2 mg/kg/h for 15 min under supplementary
oxygen via nasal catheter (2 L O2
/min), after
which the examination was initiated.
Thereafter, dexmedetomidine administra-
tion was reduced to 0.4 mg/kg/h, followed
by administration of propofol (Diprivan;
AstraZeneca, London, England) at approxi-
mately 70 to 100 mg/kg/min when necessary.
The dosages required for deep sedation and
anaesthesia were calculated based on the
ideal corrected weight (ideal weight plus
30% of the difference between actual and
ideal weight) preoperatively and actual
weight postoperatively. The safety of the
enteroscopic procedure was monitored con-
tinuously by electrocardiography, pulse
oximetry, and blood pressure assessment.
After establishment of anaesthesia, the
enteroscope (EN-450T5; Fujifilm, Tokyo,
Japan) was inserted orally and advanced
through the GI tract (including the excluded
stomach in the postoperative period), with
systematic pleating of the small bowel on the
enteroscope.20 A flexible hose and two bal-
loons (TS-13140TM; Fujifilm) were inflated
and deflated sequentially, allowing the
instrument to progress through the small
intestine with simultaneous visualization.
These actions limited intestinal stretch and
improved transmission of the manoeuvres to
position and stabilize the end of the entero-
scope. GI mucosal biopsy specimens
(approximately 15 ­ 20mg each of the stom-
ach cardia, stomach fundus, duodenum,
jejunum, and ileum) were then collected and
stored immediately in liquid nitrogen and
then at À80C. The GI biopsy sites were
marked preoperatively with India ink (Spot;
GI Supply, Camp Hill, PA, USA), allowing
sample collection from the same sites in the
postoperative period.
Primary endpoint analyses. GI transcriptomics.
For transcriptomic analysis, total RNA was
extracted from approximately 15 to 20 mg of
tissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
concentrations were measured with a spec-
trophotometer (ND-1000; NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), and
quality was assessed with the RNA integrity
number using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). For each sample, 300 mg of total
RNA was used for microarray analyses
conducted with the GeneChip 1.0 ST
Array for Humans (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Sample preparation, pro-
cessing, and hybridization were conducted
according to the instructions provided in the
GeneChip expression analysis technical
manual. Array quality was checked using
boxplots, correlation analysis, and principal
component analysis (PCA). Expression
values were obtained using the robust multi-
array average data pre-processing method.21
The combat method (http://jlab.byu.edu/
ComBat/Abstract.html) was used to remove
batch effects.22 The significance of micro-
arrays23 and rank products24 methods were
analysed to select differentially expressed
genes using the criterion of P < 0.05 (cor-
rected for the false discovery rate).25 All
analytical tools are available in the R
Bioconductor program (http://www.biocon-
ductor.org/). Real-time reverse-transcription
quantitative polymerase chain reaction was
performed to validate the significance of
changes in some genes of interest identified
by microarray analysis using TaqMan gene
expression assays (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Biochemical and hormonal markers of
glucose homeostasis. The concentrations of
glucose, insulin, glucagon, and C-peptide;
lipid profiles (low-density lipoprotein chol-
esterol, very-low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and triglycerides); and concentrations of GI
hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-
dependent insulinotrophic peptide, peptide
YY, and ghrelin) were measured in plasma or
1364 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
serum samples collected several weeks before
surgery; at 3, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 days
after RYGB; and at 1 and 2 years after
RYGB. The glycated haemoglobin concen-
tration was also measured before, 3 months
and at 1 and 2 years after RYGB. All blood
samples were collected after 12-h fasts, and
collection was performed 30, 60, 90, and
120 min after oral intake of 200 mL of a
liquid formula diet (Ensure; Abbott, Abbott
Park, IL, USA). The glucose, glycated
haemoglobin, insulin, and C-peptide concen-
trations and lipid profiles were analysed at
the Clinical Laboratory of HC-FMUSP
using enzymatic methods (glucose and lipid
profiles), liquid chromatography (LC) (gly-
cated haemoglobin), and electrochemilumi-
nescence (insulin and C-peptide). GI
hormones were analysed using the multiplex
technique (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). At the time of initial blood collection,
additional samples were collected to obtain
plasma (EDTA tubes, centrifugation at
878 g, 4C, 10 min) and serum (dry tubes,
centrifugation at 2800 rpm, 20C, 10 min) for
proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic ana-
lyses. For GI hormone and proteomic assess-
ments, plasma samples were treated with a
protease inhibitor (Complete Mini; Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Plasma proteomics and lipidomics. We
planned to correlate the activity of differen-
tially expressed GI genes with plasma prote-
omic and lipidomic data obtained by mass
spectrometry (MS) at the systemic level.
Global plasma lipid profiles were assessed
(shotgun lipidomics) before and after
RYGB by matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization MS. Shotgun proteomic analyses
were performed for protein profiling using
nano-scale LC tandem MS (LC-MS/MS), a
well-established technique for peptide iden-
tification from complex mixtures (i.e., pro-
tein digests). We planned to further validate
the identification of proteins of interest by
shotgun analysis using MS, with a targeted
approach when necessary.26
Plasma and urine metabolomics. Plasma
obtained from EDTA-treated blood samples
was aliquoted in polypropylene microtubes
and stored at À80C until metabolomic
analysis. Next, 24-h urine samples were
collected in appropriate containers, the
supernatants were removed (15 min of cen-
trifugation at 1500 g, 4C), and the remain-
ing samples were aliquoted in polypropylene
microtubes and stored at À80C until meta-
bolomic analysis. We planned to assess the
plasma and urine metabolomic profiles
using global (to describe a large number of
metabolites) and targeted approaches,
enabling the collection of qualitative and
quantitative data. The following analyses
were also planned: global metabolomic ana-
lysis, performed as described previously27,28;
targeted metabolomic analysis, described in
detail in patent US 2007/0004044 (http://
www.freepatentsonline.com/20070004044.
html); metabolite quantification, performed
using a reference and appropriate internal
standards; and metabolite panels compris-
ing 183 metabolites (40 acylcarnitines; 19
proteinogenic amino acids, ornithine, and
citrulline; 19 biogenic amines; sum of hex-
oses; 76 phosphatidylcholines; 14 lyso-phos-
phatidylcholines; and 15 sphingomyelins).
The web-based analytical pipeline Metabo
Analyst 2.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca) and
the ROC Curve Explorer & Tester (http://
www.roccet.ca/ROCCET/) were used for
data upload and importation, respectively.
The MetaboAnalyst protocol was used to
normalize data for univariate and multivari-
ate analyses.29
Metagenomics. The patients performed self-
collection of faecal samples at home using a
specimen collection system (Fisherbrand
Commode Specimen Collection System;
Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), as
described previously.17 The samples were
frozen immediately at À20C and trans-
ported to our laboratory by a motorcycle
courier service specializing in the transport
of biological samples under temperature
Sala et al. 1365
control. At the laboratory, the faecal sam-
ples were aliquoted immediately (without
thawing) and stored at À80C until DNA
extraction and storage at À20C, as
described previously30 and as detailed in
International Microbiome Standard IHMS-
SOP06 (http://www.microbiome-standards.
org). Library preparation for the MiSeq
Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA) involved amplification of the V3
­ V4 region of 16 S ribosomal DNA genes,
as described previously.17,31 Amplification
relied on MolTaq 16 S and the correspond-
ing master mix. The polymerase chain reac-
tion mix contained 10 ng of DNA, 1 mL of
dNTPs (10 mM), 1.25 mL each of forward
and reverse primer (20 mM), and 0.5 mL of
Taq in a total volume of 50 mL. The program
was set to 94C for 60 s, followed by 30
cycles at 94C for 60 s, 65C for 60 s, 72C
for 60 s, and final extension at 72C for
10 min. Sequencing was performed using
MiSeq technology and the Genopole
Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees genomics platform
(http://get.genotoul.fr/). The resulting
sequences were assigned to taxonomic
levels ranging from phylum to genus using
the Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.
cme.msu.edu/). To identify metagenomic
changes after RYGB, we planned to further
cluster these sequences into operational
taxonomic units or phylotypes at 97%
identity using QIIME software32 and the
CD-HIT33 program.
Metabolomics of faecal water. In micro-
tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany),
100-mg stool samples with 500 mL ultrapure
water were homogenized at 25C for 5 min
and then centrifuged at 25,200g for
10min. The supernatants of faecal water
were aliquoted (1mL) and stored at À80C.
Eventual residues were further extracted with
ice-cold methanol following the same first-
step extraction procedure. Analysis of faecal
water metabolites was performed using LC-
MS (HPLC Agilent 12906550 and iFunnel Q-
TOF; Agilent Technologies) with subsequent
metabolite confirmation by LC-MS/MS.
Chromatographic separation was performed
using a C18 column (ZORBAX Extend-C18,
2.1 Â 50mm, 1.8 u; Agilent Technologies).
Spectra were accumulated and processed
using mass hunter qualitative analysis. To
assess faecal metabolomic changes, we chose
to perform PCA (3:11 Pirouette software;
Infometrix, Bothell, WA, USA) with data
from a database matrix based on the relative
intensity of ions (m/z values) in the profiles
obtained by LC-MS using Lab Solutions
software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).34
Other discriminant techniques available for
the analysis of metabolomic datasets, includ-
ing partial least-squares discriminant analysis
35 and orthogonal partial least-squares dis-
criminant analysis36, may be used.
Secondary endpoint analyses. Nutritional
intake. Nutritional intake was assessed sev-
eral weeks before, 3, 12 and 24 months after
RYGB. Two trained dietitian oriented the
patients as described previously.37 The types
and amounts of food and beverages con-
sumed were assessed using three nutritional
tools: 24-h food records, 7-day food records,
and food frequency questionnaires. The
amount of food consumed was recorded
in terms of cooking units (e.g., table-
spoons, cups) as guided by the Consumo
Alimentar: Visualizando Porc
¸o~es (Food
Consumption Book: Viewing Portions).38
Data were used to calculate total calories
and macronutrient and micronutrient
consumption with Virtual Nutri Plus soft-
ware (www.virtualnutriplus.com.br).39 The
following data sources were chosen to
determine the food nutritional composition:
the food chemical composition table devel-
oped by Philippi40 and the Brazilian food
chemical composition table.41 We planned
to analyse pre- and postoperative nutritional
consumption using recommendations for
daily nutrient intake from the dietary refer-
ence intakes of the Food and Nutrition
1366 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
Board, Institute of Medicine,42 as a
reference.
Anthropometric measurements. Anthro
pometric measurements were performed
preoperatively, every 15 days for 3 months,
and 1 and 2 years after RYGB. Body weight
was measured using an electronic platform
scale with the patient standing in the centre
of the scale platform while barefoot and
wearing only light clothes. Height (cm) was
measured using a stadiometer (Sanny;
American Medical do Brasil, Sa
~ o Paulo,
Brazil) with the patient standing barefoot,
heels together, spine erect, and arms
extended next to the body. The body mass
index (weight/height2) was also calculated.43
The circumferences of the waist (narrowest
diameter between the xiphoid process and
iliac crest or near the umbilical region) and
hip (widest diameter over the greater tro-
chanters) were measured by adjusting a tape
in the horizontal plane, and the waist-to-hip
ratio was calculated.44,45
Body composition. Body composition was
assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis
(QuadScan4000; Bodystat, Douglas, Isle of
Man, British Isles) and air-displacement
plethysmography (ADP) (BOD POD BC
system device; Life Measurement
Instruments, Concord, CA, USA) in the
preoperative period and 3, 12 and 24 months
after RYGB. The tetrapolar body bioelec-
tric impedance analysis equipment gener-
ated electric currents of 5, 50, 100, and
200 kHz with a calibrated signal applied to
the skin via adhesive electrodes placed on
the right-side limbs. Resistance and react-
ance were used to calculate the total body
water, fat mass, and fat-free mass.46,47 For
ADP, Boyle's law (P1.V1 ¼ P2.V2, where P
is pressure and V is volume) was used to
determine body volume and to calculate
body fat and fat-free mass by applying
densitometry principles (d ¼ m/v) and using
Siri's equation: BF% ¼ (4.95/D ­ 4.5) Â 100,
where BF is body fat and D is density.
All ADP measurements and calculations
were performed automatically by the sys-
tem's software, based on air volume and
pressure variations inside the equipment
chamber when empty and when occupied
by the patient.46,47 During ADP evalu-
ations, the patients wore only underwear
and a cap to keep the hair contained and
remained in a seated position inside the
chamber. The patients removed metallic
objects such as earrings, rings, chains, and
piercings for both assessments performed to
estimate body composition.
Indirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry
was used to estimate the resting energy
expenditure (REE) preoperatively and at 3
months and 1 and 2 years after RYGB. The
patients were assessed after a 12-h overnight
fast and were instructed to refrain from any
unusual physical activity in the 24-h period
before REE measurement. After the patients
had rested for 30 min in a recumbent pos-
ition, their oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production were measured continu-
ally for 35 min using a ventilated hood and
open circuit under a canopy (Deltatrac
Monitor II MBM-200; Datex-Engstrom
Division, Instruments Corp., Helsinki,
Finland), as described previously.48 The
REE was calculated without using urinary
urea nitrogen, according to the Weir equa-
tion.49 Before each REE measurement, the
monitor was calibrated using mixed refer-
ence gases of known composition.
Postoperative follow-up: other clinical
measurements. Outpatient follow-up was per-
formed immediately postoperatively, every 2
weeks for 3 months, and 12 and 24 months
after RYGB. Data on medication use, blood
pressure, and heart rate were obtained.
SURMetaGIT study data were obtained
during 24 scheduled medical visits. The pro-
cedures are detailed in Table 1 and Figure 3.

GI ``omic'' evaluations. This sample was
determined to provide 80% power for the
detection of other general systemic effects of
RYGB using parametric (one-way analysis
of variance) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) approaches, with an esti-
mated alpha value of 0.05. The effect size
was calculated under the assumption that GI
hormone variation would be twice as great
in the postoperative than the preoperative
period.
Data analysis. The challenge faced in our
multi-omics analyses was the integration of
all data while dealing with the restrictions of
a small sample. The statistical methods used
to analyse multi-omics data consist of high-
throughput data-generation platforms that
demand high computational performance,
including machine learning.50 Before inte-
gration, we planned pre-processing of each
omics dataset by procedures such as nor-
malization or scaling, missing value imput-
ation, variable selection, and dimension
reduction.51
For microarray gene expression analysis,
we planned to primarily use the software
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen,
Redwood City, CA, USA). This tool per-
forms a functional analysis (in silico), result-
ing in networks of gene interactions.52
For ``omics'' integrated analysis, we
planned to perform initial exploratory data
analyses. We then planned to apply

multivariate methods such as co-inertia
analysis, PCA, or correspondence analysis
to examine single datasets and explore rela-
tionships between two or among more than
two datasets. We also considered the appli-
cation of approaches that allow the visual-
ization of different omics data types on
pathway maps; the use of classification
trees to identify variables predicting the
expression of associated genes53; and the
application of other advanced statistical
methodologies that have been used in
multi-omics analysis, such as the construc-
tion of artificial or Bayesian neural net-
works54 and the application of dynamic
control system theory. These approaches
would allow for the creation of a global
network of pathway interactions from gen-
etic, proteomic, and metabolomic data.
Additional statistical analysis of each study
variable and its temporal relationship, as well
as analyses integrating all omics data, were
also planned. The R statistical software
(http://www.r-project.org), including the R
Bioconductor repository, was chosen to con-
duct the statistical tests. For integrative ana-
lyses of diverse omics data, we planned to use
Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org) and STATegra
(http://www.stategra.eu) software.
Results
Initial results
The first 20 obese patients selected for omics
analysis were included in this study (demo-
graphic data are provided in Table 2); the 5
patients to be used for validation remain
under selection. The 20 initial patients com-
pleted all GI tissue, blood, urine, and faecal
sample collections. In addition, all omics (GI
gene expression, plasma protein, plasma
metabolite, plasma lipid, faecal metage-
nomic, and faecal metabolite), nutritional,
anthropometric, body composition, and
REE data were obtained preoperatively and
3 months postoperatively, and statistical
analyses are underway. Urinary metabolites
remain to be assessed, and data from 24
months after RYGB are under collection.
The protocol steps completed and those in
the process of completion for these 20
patients are shown in Figure 1.
Discussion
Ideally, research questions should be sim-
ple and involve only a few key variables.
However, the multifactorial nature of some
contemporary diseases has hindered the
achievement of this premise. Modern
researchers increasingly face the need to
develop studies involving a wide range of
variables to answer simple questions.
Aiming to contribute to the resolution
of this issue, our article describes the proto-
col for a pan-omics clinical study of
obese patients, a useful research approach
that is rarely applied because of its great
complexity.
Obesity is a multifactorial disease that
involves several metabolic disturbances and
chronic inflammation associated with the
development of a wide range of comorbid-
ities. A major challenge of our study was to
correlate a large number of GI findings with
several systemic datasets to answer the main
question of whether potential RYGB-
induced changes in GI genes affect T2DM
remission and long-term T2DM recurrence.
A specific statistical approach was designed
to overcome this obstacle.

Our statistical design aimed to enable
correlation of a large number of variables
in relation to single clinical outcomes.
For this purpose, all analyses were initiated
individually, considering each variable and
its relationship to the study time points;
significant findings will then be integrated
to examine potential interrelationships
among variables. This statistical integration
will be conducted after concluding data
collection and analysis for the time point
of 2 years after RYGB. During application
of the statistical integration, small adjust-
ments in the statistical design will likely
be necessary.
Challenges and limitations of our proto-
col encountered to date have been related to
the acquisition of GI biopsy specimens.
The development of invasive procedures
for use in humans is a main challenge of
translational clinical hypothesis testing.
The local ethics committee was initially
reluctant to approve the collection of GI
biopsy specimens from patients for this
study. Our Digestive Endoscopy Unit is a
world reference centre at the forefront of
DBE development that enabled us to
obtain approval after intense discussions
and under the condition of properly advising
patients that biopsy specimen collection was
specific to the study protocol, and not part of
standard care, on the informed consent form.
The DBE technique has been well toler-
ated by patients in most studies, and biopsy
specimen collection during such a procedure
is quite safe. Practitioners from a German
centre reported a <1% complication rate
among a total of 3894 DBE interventions,
including those performed in patients with
mild to moderate acute pancreatitis
(0.34%), organ perforation (0.20%), and
small bowel bleeding (0.15%), the latter two
of which were related mainly to polypect-
omy.55 In our centre, no major complica-
tions have been reported for 364 DBE
procedures, 112 of which included biopsy
collection.56
The amount of GI tissue obtained from
the pre- and postoperative biopsies in this
study was sufficient for gene expression
analysis for all enrolled patients. However,
the excluded stomach portion was inaccess-
ible for postoperative biopsy sample collec-
tion in some patients because of stenosis in
the biliopancreatic limb (n ¼ 3) and the
difficulty of reaching this portion of the GI
tract (n ¼ 10). The excluded stomach may be
in a ``fallen'' position because of an excess of
gastric fluid in this region secondary to
duodenal bile reflux, which hinders passage
of the enteroscope.
Our strict patient selection criteria and
requirement for consent to the performance
of additional invasive procedures signifi-
cantly hindered patient recruitment. In add-
ition, to ensure the safety of the DBE
intervention, the number of biopsy specimens
collected was limited. We are still seeking to
optimize our methods to achieve minimum
tissue use during GI genetic analysis, but this
limitation will probably prevent us from
performing intestinal proteomic and meta-
bolomic analyses, which could improve the
interpretation of potential RYGB-induced
changes in intestinal function.
One relevant point to be observed in
conducting clinical studies is the potential
scientific contribution and clinical applica-
tion. BS has positive effects on obesity-
related comorbidities and is associated with
decreased mortality in obese patients.4
Although currently recognized as the most
effective available treatment for obese
patients, this procedure is invasive and has
potential for complications. Due to the
marked burden of obesity and related comor-
bidities on many patients worldwide, new
and effective noninvasive treatments are
urgently needed.
The performance of BS, especially tech-
niques involving malabsorptive procedures,
have an enigmatic metabolic effect that
manifests primarily as T2DM remission
almost immediately postoperatively. Among
Sala et al. 1371
the several hypotheses proposed to explain
this phenomenon, the effect of reduced post-
operative food intake is the only proposed
theory that does not involve bowel-induced
metabolic factors. This hypothesis suggests
that deprivation of oral ingestion in the
immediate postoperative period minimally
challenges pancreatic b cells, but the hypoth-
esis is weakened when we consider that food
deprivation occurs regardless of the surgical
technique applied and that postoperative
glycaemic control is minimal after strictly
restrictive procedures.57
The other proposed hypotheses (which
implicate intestinal gluconeogenesis, the
hindgut, and the foregut) involve the poten-
tial participation of intestinal products in
T2DM remission, mainly by correcting the
imbalanced release of anti-diabetogenic sig-
nals (incretins and other insulinotrophic
hormones) and diabetogenic signals (incom-
pletely understood anti-incretin factors) that
are apparently involved in its pathophysi-
ology.58,59 Taken together, these hypotheses
strongly suggest that the GI tract actively
participates in the metabolic effects of some
BS procedures on glucose homeostasis; to
date, however, these hypotheses are sup-
ported only by experimental data. The
SURMetaGIT study was designed to con-
tribute to this issue by providing clinical
evidence explaining the molecular mechan-
isms involved in T2DM remission after
RYGB, with consideration of the human
gut as the major driver of these processes.
In addition to their benefits in terms
of T2DM remission, RYGB-induced meta-
bolic changes may contribute to the
improvement or worsening of other obe-
sity-related comorbidities involving meta-
bolic factors. For instance, preoperative
bone metabolism dysfunction and osteope-
nia are common in obese individuals and are
associated in part with vitamin D deficiency.
In the postoperative period, these bone
disturbances may be accentuated and corre-
lated partially with weight loss, even when
vitamin D deficiency is reduced by supple-
mentation and other bone health markers
have improved.60 In this context, although
the SURMetaGIT study focuses on T2DM
remission, its complex design may provide
unpredictable additional answers concern-
ing the remission or enhancement of other
obesity-related conditions, such as meta-
bolic syndrome, changes in cognitive func-
tion, and bone metabolic disorders.
In conclusion, application of our proto-
col allowed us to collect essential data that
will contribute to the understanding of
molecular mechanisms involved in the
remission of T2DM and other obesity-
related comorbidities. These data may also
guide the design of new noninvasive treat-
ment approaches for obesity-related meta-
bolic disorders, particularly T2DM. The
potential scientific contributions of the
SURMetaGIT study are promising, and
their successful manifestation will require
proper statistical analysis of the data gener-
ated and the application of knowledge for
larger-scale interpretation. Our partial
results demonstrate the applicability of our
protocol by showing reliable patient adher-
ence and data collection over time. Effects
data are not presented here because they are
beyond the scope of this article, which only
describes our protocol. Confirmation of
T2DM remission (using the primary end-
points) at least 1 year after RYGB and the
statistical integration of data after the 2-year
follow-up will likely generate several articles
that better detail our findings.
