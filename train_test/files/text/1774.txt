Food Insecurity Is not Associated With Lower
Energy Intakes
Claire A. Zizza1, Patricia A. Duffy2 and Shirley A. Gerrior3
We examined the association between food insecurity and total daily energy intakes in American men and women.
We estimated the number of daily snacks and meals consumed by individuals in different food security categories.
Also, we calculated the energy contribution, energy density, and food group sources of those snacks and meals.
Using the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examined the Food Security
Survey Module (FSSM) and dietary information from the 24-h recall. Differences in energy intakes between groups
were not significant. Women who were food insecure without hunger (FIWOH) and food insecure with hunger (FIWH)
had significantly fewer meals than food secure (FS) women. The energy contribution of each meal and the total energy
contributed from snacking were both significantly greater for FIWOH women than for FS women. The number of meals
was significantly lower whereas the daily number of snacking occasions and the total energy from snacking were
significantly increased for FIWOH men relative to FS men. FIWOH men consumed snack foods that had significantly
lower energy density than those consumed by FS men. Among men and women, the major sources of meal energy
were the grain group, the meat, poultry, and fish group, and the sugar, sweets, and beverages group whereas the
major source of snacking energy was the sugar, sweets, and beverages group. Total energy intakes were not different
for FI individuals; however, their meal and snack behaviors were different. Focusing solely on total energy intake would
miss important consequences of food insecurity.

Introduction
Findings from the Current Population Survey indicate that in
2006 11% of households in the United States were food insecure
(FI), defined as having "limited or uncertain availability of nutri-
tionally adequate and safe food or limited or uncertain ability to
acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways" (1,2). Food
insecurity has been associated with obesity, heart disease, diabe-
tes, high blood pressure, and food allergies (3­7).
Despite this vulnerability, very little research attention has
been given to the diet of FI individuals. Three studies found that
adult women who experienced food insufficiency/
insecurity
had lower energy intakes than those who reported food suf-
ficiency/security whereas one study found no differences in
energyintake(8­11).Anotherstudythatincludedbothmenand
women found no differences in energy intake between adults
from food-insufficient and food-sufficient households (12).
Researchers have found that the majority of women in all
levels of food sufficiency reported between two and seven eat-
ing occasions per day, and there were no significant differences
in number of eating occasions per day or the amount of nutri-
ents obtained from snacks (11). Other researchers have found
a reduced meal frequency among low-income and/or food
stamp participants (13,14). In fact, skipping meals "because
there wasn't enough money" is one construct used to measure
food insecurity (2). To our knowledge, evidence of reduced
meal frequency has not been documented in FI individuals
with dietary assessment techniques, such as a 24-h recall.
Because of the paucity of the literature on this issue, we
undertookthisstudytofurthertheunderstandingofthedietary
behaviors of FI individuals. Differences in dietary behaviors
may provide insights regarding the previously reported associ-
ation between obesity and food insecurity. Using a 24-h recall,
we examined the association between food insecurity and total
daily energy and macronutrient intakes in American men and
women. We estimated the number of daily snacks and meals
consumed by individuals in different food security categories.
Also, we calculated the energy contribution, energy density,
and food group sources of those snacks and meals.
We hypothesized that daily total energy intakes would not
be different for FI or food secure (FS) individuals; however
there would be considerable differences regarding their meal
and snack behaviors. We hypothesized that a reduction in meal

frequency among FI individuals would be offset by an increase
in energy per meal. We also hypothesized that the energy from
snacking would be greater in FI than FS individuals.
Methods And Procedures
Data sources
National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 1999­2002 provides
information about people's consumption of foods and nutrients, as well
as extensive health-related data, and information about Americans'
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. NHANES 1999­2002
is a complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population of the United States.
Food security measures
The NHANES 1999­2002 contains the 18-item Food Security Survey
Module (FSSM), which has been shown to be a stable, robust, and reli-
able measurement tool (15). The NHANES 1999­2002 data are released
in four food security categories: FS, marginally FS (MFS), FI without
hunger (FIWOH), and FI with hunger (FIWH). The time frame for
the FSSM is the last 12 months. Because we focused on adults for this
analysis, we used the ten-item adult measure to ensure that the same
measure was used for every individual.
Dietary assessment
For the 1999­2002 NHANES, individuals' dietary intakes were col-
lected through an interviewer-administered 24-h dietary recall method.
Research has shown that food intake data obtained from a 1-day dietary
recall are reliable measures of usual intakes of population groups (16).
Details regarding the specification of snack and meal occasions have
been described elsewhere (17). Nutrient intakes obtained from the
NHANES data set do not include nutrients from dietary supplements,
medications, or plain drinking water but do include nutrients from
beverages other than drinking water. The number of meal occasions
and snacking occasions were calculated over the entire 24h for each
individual. The energy contributions per snack and per meal, and the
total energy contributions of snacks and meals, were calculated. The
relative caloric contribution of food groups defined by US Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies,
1.0 (2004, Beltsville, MD: Agriculture Research Service, Food Surveys
Research Group) was also calculated.
Because of methodological differences in the treatment of beverages,
it has been recommended that energy density values be calculated using
solely food items (18). Thus using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database
for Dietary Studies, 1.0 to beverages, we calculated the energy density
(kcal/g) of food items (specific USDA food codes used are available from
the authors). The contributions from beverages were excluded only from
the energy density values. All other calculations included contribution
from beverages.
Analytical sample
The analytical sample included adults who completed the adult-level
FSSM. Individuals were screened into the FSSM using the USDA food
adequacy indicator and/or income. We excluded women who were
pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Because researchers have reported
associations between food insecurity and obesity among adults, we
included individuals 18 years of age (7,19­25). To avoid including
older individuals, many of whom have low energy intakes, we excluded
respondents >60 years of age (17). Because prior researchers have found
differences among FI men and women, we stratified by gender (women
n = 2,707; men n = 2,933) (ref. 3).

Data analysis strategy
To examine the relationship between food security status and our
dietary outcomes, we used multivariate linear regression. Possible
confounders, including age, race-ethnicity, education, and income,
were included in our analysis. Age was categorized as 18 to 30 and
>30 to 60 years. Three race/ethnicity categories were examined: non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic. Level of education
was defined as less than high school degree or more high school degree.
Household income was defined as a ratio; each household's income was
compared with appropriate poverty thresholds. In all models, FS indi-
viduals were the referent group.
To account for mobile examination center sample design and sampling
weights, we used STATA (Version 8; STATA, College Station, TX) to
estimate all descriptive and inferential statistics. To examine whether age,
race/ethnicity, and education were differentially distributed among the
levels of food security and thus possible confounders, we used 2-tests of
independence. A P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Office of
Human Subjects Research.

the sugar, sweets, and beverages group contributed more than
half their snacking energy (Figure 1). Among women, grain
products were the next largest energy source and contrib-
uted between 33% among MFS and FIWOH and 26% among
FIWH. The dairy group was the third leading energy source
for women and contributed between 15% among FS and 9%
among FIWOH.
Discussion
Our results show that an increase in meal size and the energy
obtained by snacking appears to compensate for a reduced meal
frequency among FI individuals. Our results provide a pos-
sible mechanism in which FI individuals who skip meals may
actually be able to consume sufficient or more than sufficient
amounts energy. The increase in snacking energy may to be
attributed to an increase in snacking frequency among FIWOH
men. Although the energy per snacking occasion was not sig-
nificantly different in FIWH women, the modest increase likely
becomes amplified when considering the frequency of snack-
ing. Other researchers have also shown that snacking is associ-
ated with higher total energy intake among adults (26­28).
To our knowledge, this is the first report where a 24-h recall
was used to demonstrate a reduced meal frequency among FI
individuals. Our findings provide validation that the responses
to the FSSM questionnaire are reflected in the dietary behav-
iors observed in the 24-h recall. Other research has shown
that skipping meals is a food choice coping strategy (14).
Competing demands for individuals' time and energy, such as
an increased need to work more than one job, may contribute
to fewer meals.
in energy intake were not observed among men or women.
MFS women had significantly higher intakes of protein than
FS women, whereas FIWH women had significantly higher
intakes of total and saturated fat than FS women.
The adjusted means for meal and snack occasions and their
energy contributions are presented in Table 3. FIWOH and
FIWH women had significantly fewer meals than FS women.
Mean energy contribution of each meal and the total energy
contributed from snacking were both significantly greater for
FIWOH women than for FS women. Among FIWOH men,
the daily number of meals was significantly decreased whereas
the daily number of snacks and the total energy from snacking
were significantly higher than for FS. FIWOH men consumed
snack foods that had a significantly lower energy density than
FS men.
The major sources of energy during meal occasions were sim-
ilar for all levels of food security and for both women and men.
For men and women, the grain group was the major source
of energy during meal occasions (ranging from 30% among
FIWH men to 34% among FIWH women), followed by meat,
poultry, fish, egg, and mixtures (ranging from 22% among FS
women to 27% among MFS men). The third largest energy
source was the sugars, sweets, and beverages group for men
and women, ranging from 14% in MFS and FIWH women to
21% in FIWH men (results regarding the caloric contribution
of all food groups are available from the authors).
For men and women, the major source of energy from
snacking was the sugar, sweets, and beverages group. Among
women, sugar, sweets, and beverages contributed between
34% among FS and 39% among MFS. Among FIWH men,

to be higher than meal foods in all groups and thus, the passive
overconsumption of snack foods may be a concern.
Another possible mechanism for the food insecurity­obesity
association is the "boom and bust" cycle of food consumption
linked to food stamps benefits (34). Researchers found food
stamp recipients who shopped for food infrequently consumed
less energy over the food stamp cycle; however, this difference
was not extreme (34). In the same study, frequent shoppers
who received food stamps showed no significant differences
in energy intakes. Two other studies that examined repeated
24-h recalls found no significant differences in energy intakes
over time (8,35).
Our results provide insights regarding the food stamps­
obesity association (36,37). Food stamps may alleviate the most
stringent deprivations; however, they do not increase the likeli-
hood that a FI household will become completely FS (37). Our
results show that the dietary behaviors of women at every level
(FIWH, FIWOH, and MFS) were different from FS women.
Thus food stamps may not allow recipients, particularly those
in the most FI categories, to achieve the dietary behaviors of FS
individuals.
One important consideration is that the dietary intake data
we examined are self-reported, and self-reported information
may yield biased results (38­40). Underreporting has been
inversely related to socioeconomic status and other evidence
suggests that overweight individuals underreport intakes
(41­44). Another consideration is that the food security mea-
surements encompass the past 12 months while the dietary
information encompasses one 24-h recall. When individuals
are classified as FI in the past 12 months, one cannot be certain
that the episodes of hardship occurred during the 24-h period
assessed by the dietary recall.
The results from this study demonstrate that skipping meals
can be associated with diets that are adequate and possibly more
than adequate in energy. We found an increase in meal size, and
the energy obtained by snacking appears to compensate for a
reduced meal frequency. Thus focusing solely on total energy
intake is likely to miss important consequences of food insecu-
rity.Wethereforerecommendthatnutritioninterventionsaimed
at FI audiences should also target meal and snack behaviors.

Another item used to measure food insecurity, cutting back
on portion size, was not evident in our results. However, "cut-
ting back" is difficult to assess and this behavior would result
in lower energy values per eating occasion if the energy den-
sity of the consumed foods at that occasion remained con-
stant. FIWOH women had greater energy per meal values and
FIWOH men had greater energy per snack values than those
of FS groups. A larger meal or snack is another mechanism
in which those who skip meals can achieve sufficient or more
than sufficient daily energy intakes.
Our findings, that FI and FS daily energy intakes did not dif-
fer, suggest that skipping meals might not indicate an energy
shortage. Two other reports found no differences in energy
intakes of adults from food insufficient/insecure and food
sufficient/secure families (10,12). However, three other stud-
ies found women from food insufficient/insecure households
to have lower energy intakes than those from food sufficient/
secure households (8,9,11).
Other research has demonstrated a link between obesity and
food insecurity, which raises several questions. Researchers
have explored the relationship of rising obesity levels and the
technical change that has made food less expensive and physi-
cal activity more expensive (29). These researchers propose
that higher incomes would result in an increased demand for
food and the desire to be thin. Changes in the relative costs of
food and physical activity would have different effects depend-
ing on an individuals' income.
We cannot definitely state that dietary behaviors alone pro-
mote obesity. However, in a study examining women's socioeco-
nomic status and weight control practices, Jeffery and French
concluded that dietary behaviors are the most likely proximal
cause of socioeconomic status differences in obesity (30). Several
mechanisms involving dietary behaviors have been proposed
to explain the obesity and food insecurity link (6,19,31,32).
One mechanism proposes that FI women over-consume one
macronutrient. For example, Dietz concluded an increased fat
consumption was responsible for the obesity/insecurity associa-
tion (31). We found FIWH women had higher fat intakes than
FS women; however, this did not translate to higher energy
intakes. Previous research has shown that FIWH was not related
to BMI among women (7). Researchers did find overweight to
be associated with MFS and FIWOH among women (7). Our
results showed that MFS women had higher protein intakes than
FS women but this did not translate to higher energy intakes. We
found that a considerable portion of snack energy was provided
by the sugars, sweets, and beverages group among men. Previous
research has shown that the highest consumers of sugar in all
its forms are younger males; however this subpopulation is not
linked to a greater risk of obesity (33).
Another mechanism suggests that low-income families
maintain their energy intakes by purchasing low-cost items
that are high-energy dense foods which may promote overcon-
sumption (19­21). We found that the energy density values for
the FI (MFS, FIWH, FIWOH) were not greater than FS. In fact
FIWOH men had a lower energy density value for snack foods
than FS men. We observed the energy density of snack foods
