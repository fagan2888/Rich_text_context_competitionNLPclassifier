Abstract
Histones deacetylases (HDACs), besides their function as epigenetic regulators, deacetylate and critically regulate the activity
of nonhistone targets. In particular, HDACs control partially the proapoptotic activity of p53 by balancing its acetylation state.
HDAC inhibitors have revealed neuroprotective properties in different models, but the exact mechanisms of action remain
poorly understood. We have generated a conditional knockout mouse model targeting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to
investigate specifically the functional role of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in an acute model of optic nerve injury. Our results
demonstrate that combined HDAC1 and HDAC2 ablation promotes survival of axotomized RGCs. Based on global gene
expression analyses, we identified the p53-PUMA apoptosis-inducing axis to be strongly activated in axotomized mouse
RGCs. Specific HDAC1/2 ablation inhibited this apoptotic pathway by impairing the crucial acetylation status of p53 and
reducing PUMA expression, thereby contributing to the ensuing enhanced neuroprotection due to HDAC1/2 depletion.
HDAC1/2 inhibition and the affected downstream signaling components emerge as specific targets for developing therapeutic
strategies in neuroprotection.

Introduction
Lysine acetylation is an essential, reversible, and highly
regulated posttranslational modification. This crucial
process is controlled by histone acetyltranferase (HATs)
and histone deacetyltransferase (HDACs) that are
together responsible for the critical balance of acetylation
and deacetylation within the cell. In its epigenetic func-
tion, HDAC activity triggers condensed chromatin archi-
tecture that limits transcription by removing acetyl
groups from histones. However, HDAC scan also con-
tribute to nonepigenetic regulation in that HDACs are
capable of deacetylating and centrally regulating the
activity of several transcription factors as well as of
other proteins (Glozak et al., 2005; Yao and Yang, 2011).
HDACs have emerged as promising targets for thera-
peutic interventions in pathological conditions, including
neurodegenerative disorders, and HDAC inhibitors have
been shown to rescue or delay neuronal death
(Chuang et al., 2009; Dietz and Casaccia, 2010;
Zalewska et al., 2014). In particular, in the optic system,
HDAC3 appears to play a major regulatory role in
injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in a glaucoma
model (Pelzel et al., 2012; Chindasub et al., 2013).
The tumor suppressor p53, an essential transcription
factor for genes involved in cell cycle progression and
initiation of apoptosis, especially also in neurological
insults (Morrison et al., 2003), is a nonhistone protein
target of HDACs (Gu and Roeder, 1997). Indeed, p53

can be acetylated by p300/CBP at multiple lysine residues
within the C-terminal DNA binding regulatory domain,
strongly correlated with protein stabilization and activa-
tion (Brooks and Gu, 2011). On the other hand, HDAC1,
HDAC2, or SIRT1, a member of the Class III family of
HDACs, can act as p53 deacetylases (Murphy et al.,
1999; Juan et al., 2000; Luo et al., 2000, 2001; Harms
and Chen, 2007; LeBoeuf et al., 2010). Deacetylation of
p53 by HDACs is commonly accepted to reduce its tran-
scriptional activity, although the acetylation-dependent
activity of p53 appears to be acetylation-site specific
and cell-type specific (Brochier et al., 2013).
The mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors are neu-
roprotective are only partially understood. In addition,
most of the available studies are based on drug-mediated
inhibition with the intrinsic caveat of specificity prob-
lems. In this study, we have used specific genetic depletion
of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 (HDAC1/2) in RGCs
in vivo to avoid misguiding off-target effects. Using the
optic nerve transection model to induce RGC apoptosis,
we found a pronounced neuroprotective effect due to
HDAC1/2 depletion. Furthermore, we discovered that
the p53-PUMA apoptosis-inducing axis was strongly
activated in axotomized RGCs of control mice, reminis-
cent of reports in the rat (Wilson et al., 2013, 2014).
HDAC1/2 ablation inhibited this proapoptotic function
of p53, consistent with its aberrant acetylation status and
impaired expression of the proapoptotic factor PUMA.
Materials and Methods
Mouse Mutants
Mice homozygous for Hdac1loxP/loxP and Hdac2loxP/loxP
alleles (Yamaguchi et al., 2010) were crossed with mice
expressing a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombin-
ase under control of the Thy-1 gene regulatory sequences
(Thy-1-YFP: Thy-1-CreERT2, SLICK-H; Young et al.,
2008) to ablate HDAC1 and HDAC2 in neurons.
Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using genomic DNA. Animal use was approved by
the veterinary office of the Canton of Zurich,
Switzerland.
Retrograde Labeling and Quantification of
Neuronal Survival
Retrograde labeling of RGCs was performed using
Fluorogold (FG; 2%, Fluorochrome) in 0.9% NaCl,
which was applied to both superior colliculi as described
(Sapieha et al., 2005). The left optic nerve was transected
0.5 to 1 mm from the optic nerve head at 1 week after FG
application as previously described (Berkelaar et al.,
1994; Cheng et al., 2002; Lebrun-Julien et al., 2010).
Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde; eyes
were dissected and flat mounted vitreal side up on glass
slides. FG-positive RGCs were counted in 12 retinal
zones: Three areas in each eye quadrant (dorsal, ventral,
nasal, and temporal) were examined, corresponding to a
total area of 0.5 mm2. Wild-type uninjured retinas were
compared with control (CreÀ; Hdac1loxP/loxP, and
Hdac2loxP/loxP) and HDAC1/2 mutant uninjured or axo-
tomized retinas.
Retinal Immunohistochemistry
Mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection injection of
pentobarbital (150 mg/kg; Nembutal, Abbott
Laboratories) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Tissue sections were incubated in 5% bovine serum albu-
min and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to block nonspecific
binding and then incubated with primary antibodies over-
night at 4C, followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies at room temperature. Antibodies include
anti-anti-GFP (Aves labs, GFP-1020), anti-HDAC1
(PA1-860, Thermo Scientific), anti-HDAC2 (H2663,
Sigma), anti-Phospho-p53 Ser15 (9284, Cell Signaling),
and anti-PUMA (7467, Cell Signaling). After washing
with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated
with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488 (1:250,
Invitrogen) or Cy3 (1:250, Jackson Laboratories) for 1 hr
at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered
saline, and mounted with IMMU-MOUNT (Thermo
Scientific). Staining was observed using a fluorescence
microscope (Axioplan2 Imaging, Carl Zeiss). Images
were digitized with a Powershot G5 camera (Canon)
and acquired with Axio Vision 4.5 software (Carl
Zeiss). Images were further processed (levels adjusted)
using Photoshop CS5 software (Adobe).
Western Blot
Retinas were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris
[pH 8.0], 135 mM NaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
[SDS], and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease
inhibitors) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The
supernatants were collected and diluted in Laemmli
sample buffer 5Â (4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.004% bro-
mophenol blue, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and 0.125 M Tris,
pH 6.8). Extracts were processed using standard sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) and Western blotting procedures using precast
Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad). Equal volumes
were loaded on the gels. Antibodies include anti-acetyl

RNA Sequencing
Purified RNA from mouse retinas harvested 2 days after
injury in both HDAC1/2 mutant and control mice was
analyzed, using the contralateral intact retinas as intact
control. The poly(A)-enriched transcriptome were
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000/2500 (Functional
Genomics Center Zu
¨ rich [FGCZ], Switzerland). Reads
were aligned with the STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) aligner
with the additional options (­outFilterMatchNmin 30 ­
outFilterMismatchNmax 5 ­outFilterMismatchNoverLmax
0.05 ­outFilterMultimapNmax 50). Read alignments were
only reported for reads with less than 50 valid alignments.
As reference, the mouse genome build and annotation
(version 75) from Ensembl (GRCm38) and splice junc-
tions derived from the Ensemble gene annotations were
used. Expression counts were computed using the
Bioconductor package GenomicRanges (Lawrence
et al., 2013). Differential expression was computed
using the EdgeR package (Robinson et al., 2010). The
reads were normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M
values method as described (Dillies et al., 2013). The
heat map was created using R (Software version 3.1.0).
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analyses, Prism 5 (GraphPad Software,
Inc.) was applied. Data are shown as the mean Æ SEM.
Statistical significance was determined using one-way
analysis of variance test for groups of more than two,
and a two-tailed Student's t-test was used for groups of
two. Significance was set at *p < .05, **p < .01, and
***p < .001. n represents the number of independent

Results
Generation of Conditional Knockout Mice That Lack
HDAC1/2 in RGCs
To address the specific functions of HDAC1/2 in RGCs,
we generated tamoxifen-inducible Thy-1-YFP: Thy-1-
CreERT2 mice combined with conditional Hdac1 and
Hdac2 double-floxed alleles (Figure 1(a)). We decided
to analyze HDAC1/2 double mutants, since HDAC1
and HDAC2 can often compensate for each other
(Montgomery et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2009). In our
system, two copies of the Thy1 promoter are used in
opposite direction (back-to-back) to simultaneously
express CreRT2 and (yellow fluorescent protein) YFP
in the same cells. Using retinal immunohistochemistry
in transgenic mice without tamoxifen injection, we
detected a strong YFP signal in the retinal ganglion cell
layer and weaker signals in some cells of the inner nuclear
layer. All RGCs, retrogradely labeled with FG, were YFP
positive (Figure 1(b)) confirming previous observations
using Thy-1-YFP: Thy-1-CreERT2 (SLICK-H) mice
(Young et al., 2008). Next, we assessed the efficiency of
HDAC1/2 loss in tamoxifen-injected HDAC1/2-double
mutants by immunochemistry. Both HDAC1 and
HDAC2 were efficiently lost in YFP-positive cells of the
ganglion cell layer (Figure 1(c)), establishing the suitabil-
ity of this genetic model to eliminate HDAC1/2 expres-
sion in RGCs.
Ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGCs Promotes
Their Survival After Injury
Next, we addressed the in vivo neuroprotection potential
due to specific HDAC1/2 depletion using optic nerve
axotomy as injury model in our genetic HDAC1/2
mutants (Figure 2(a)). After tamoxifen-induced
HDAC1/2 recombination, followed by axotomy, retinae
were examined at 1 and 2 weeks postinjury to determine

ing. In wild-type uninjured retinae and control (tamox-
ifen-injected, CreÀ; Hdac1loxP/loxP and Hdac2loxP/loxP)
uninjured retinae, the mean density of FG-labeled
RGCs was 4,267 Æ 211 cells/mm2 and 4,365 Æ 66 cells/
mm2, respectively, with no significant difference. Thus,
tamoxifen injection itself does not induce RGC death.
Furthermore, intact tamoxifen-injected HDAC1/2
mutant retinae, with a cell density of 4,111 Æ 309 cells/
mm2, did not show significantly altered cell death com-
pared with controls. Thus, loss of HDAC1/2 per se does
not induce RGC death. However, both at 1 and 2 weeks
after injury, HDAC1/2 mutants showed significantly
increased RGC survival compared with controls
(Figure 2(b) and (c)). One week after injury, 78% Æ 0.06
of RGCs survived in HDAC1/2 mutants compared with
56.3% Æ 0.02 in the controls (40.7% Æ 0.01 compared
with 21.5% Æ 0.03 after 2 weeks; Figure 2(b)). Together,
in agreement with previous studies using pharmacological
inhibitors (Pelzel et al., 2010, 2012; Chindasub et al.,
2013), these results support HDAC inhibition as a poten-
tial therapeutic approach in neuroprotection.
Furthermore, HDAC1/2 is identified as specific critical
targets.
Identification of Candidate Pathways Responsible for
Neuroprotection due to HDAC1/2 Depletion
Early gene silencing and transcriptional dysregulation are
hallmarks of models of neurodegeneration, including
glaucoma and axonal injury (Ahmed et al., 2004; Yang
et al., 2007; Soto et al., 2008), while HDACs can affect
transcription at various levels (Nusinzon and Horvath,
2005). Thus, we hypothesised that HDAC1/2 ablation
may lead to changes in mRNA levels that may explain
the observed neuroprotection phenotype. To address this
issue, we analyzed retinal transcriptome profiles of
HDAC1/2 mutants and control retinae, with or without
injury, by RNAseq. We decided to analyze retinas 2 days
postinjury (2 dpi), prior to the onset of evident RGC
death that starts around 5 dpi, to avoid major over-
shadowing secondary effects due to massive cell death
(Villegas-Perez et al., 1993; Berkelaar et al., 1994;
Lebrun-Julien et al., 2009). While we processed our
Figure 2. Ablation of HDAC1/2 protects retinal ganglion cells from axotomy-induced death. (a) Outline of the experimental procedure:
HDAC1/2 mutants carrying the Thy-1-YFP: Thy-1-CreERT2 allele and littermate controls were injected with tamoxifen for five consecutive
days at 2 months of age. Retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled with Fluorogold 9 days after the last tamoxifen injection and
subsequently axotomized 1 week later. Retinal ganglion cell survival was assessed by quantification of fluorescent neurons in whole-
mounted retinas. (b) Quantitative analysis of retinal ganglion cell survival at 1 and 2 weeks after optic nerve transection in control and

data, another retinal transcriptome, obtained at 2 days
following optic nerve crush, was published (Yasuda et al.,
2014). A comparison of those data with our data from
injured control retinae revealed, despite the use of slightly
different injury models, that nine of their ``top 10'' upre-
gulated transcripts and five of their ``top 10'' downregu-
lated transcripts overlap with our top 20 up- and
downregulated transcripts (Table 1). Next, we started
with a systematic analysis by comparing first intact unin-
jured retinae from HDAC1/2 mutants to controls
(Figure 3(a) and (b)). This analysis revealed a global
gene expression shift with 5,569 genes significantly
(p < .05) upregulated and 10,296 genes downregulated
in HDAC1/2 mutants (Figure 3(b)). A similar proportion
of activated versus repressed genes has also been
observed in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors
(Mariadason et al., 2000; Chambers et al., 2003). Given
these findings and based on additional comparative ana-
lyses of the available four different data sets (controls,
HDAC1/2 mutants, both intact and injured; Table 2;
Figure 3(a) and (b)), we decided to focus our further
evaluations on those genes that were most significantly
regulated after injury in controls. We hypothesized that
expression changes in these genes have a high likelihood
to regulate the ensuing neuronal cell death and survival.
In addition, comparing the level of regulation of these
genes with that observed between uninjured and injured
HDAC1/2 mutants, in combination with a candidate
selection approach, may allow us to filter out relevant
regulators that are altered due to HDAC1/2 depletion
and might be involved in the ensuing neuroprotection
effect. Thus, we generated a heat map of the changes of
the top up- and downregulated genes using R software
with a p value under .001 and a fold change !1.5
(Figure 3(c)). A similar regulation pattern appeared for
changes in controls and in the HDAC1/2 mutants.
However, closer inspections, applying the criteria out-
lined above, identified key components of the proapopto-
tic JNK-p53 stress-activated pathway, including the JNK
target c-Jun and two p53 targets, p21 and PUMA, to be
potentially involved in the observed neuroprotection due
to HDAC1/2 depletion (Figure 3(c) and (d)).
Comparable Activation of the JNK Pathway in
Control and HDAC1/2-Ablated Retinae After Injury
JNK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
family (also known as the stress-activated protein kinases
or SAPKs) that is activated in response to a variety of
cellular stresses. Sustained activation contributes to cell
death through different targets including c-Jun (Whitfield
et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2007, p. 53; Fuchs et al., 1998a,
1998b) and Hrk (Chang et al., 2013). Previous studies
have demonstrated that JNK signaling and its target
transcription factor c-Jun are activated in RGCs
following optic nerve injury. Furthermore, double defi-
ciency for Jnk2 and Jnk3 strongly protects mouse
RGCs from injury (Fernandes et al., 2012, 2013). Thus,
we assessed the role of the JNK pathway in our model. At
the transcriptional level, RNA-seq analysis showed that
the JNK target c-Jun was increased in both HDAC1/2
mutants and controls after injury, but the basal level and
the upregulation were lower in the mutant (Figures 3(c)
and 4(a)). As expected, further analysis of the RNA-seq
data of injured control retinae revealed also upregulation
of harakiri (Hrk), a regulator of cell death that belongs to
the family of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins that are
mainly found in the nervous system tissue
(Wakabayashi et al., 2002; Figures 3(c) and 4(a)).
However, mutant injured retinae showed a comparable
upregulation to controls, in line with a recent study con-
cluding that Hrk is not the main effector for RGC death
after injury (Fernandes et al., 2013; Figures 3(c) and 4(a)).
p53 mRNA levels did not change after injury. However,
they were significantly lower in both intact and axoto-
mized mutant retinas compared with controls
(Figure 4(a)).
Next, we examined the ability of HDAC1/2-ablated
RGCs to activate the JNK pathway following injury.
Thus, we analyzed retinal homogenates of control and
HDAC1/2 mutant mice after 2 dpi and 4 dpi. In both
HDAC1/2 mutants and controls, the injury triggered
comparable activation by phosphorylation of JNK and
its target c-Jun, sustained at 4 dpi in both cases
(Figure 4(b)). Consistent with the observations at the
mRNA level, the basal protein level of c-Jun was signifi-
cantly lower in the intact mutant retinae but increased
after injury. Since Erk1/2, another mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase, is known to protect RGCs upon sustained
activation (Cheng et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2005), we
tested also the ability of HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs to acti-
vate this pathway. We observed similar activation of
Erk1/2 at 2 dpi and 4 dpi both in the mutant and control
retinae (Figure 4(b)). Taken together, these data indicate
that HDAC1/2 mutants retain largely the ability to acti-
vate the MAP kinase pathways.
Transcription of PUMA and p21 Is Impaired in
HDAC1/2-Ablated and Axotomized RGCs
We decided to follow-up on the observed lower p53 levels
in HDAC1/2 mutants compared with controls
(Figure 4(a)) since p53 is a major regulator of apoptosis
(Elmore, 2007). More specifically, p53 acts as a transcrip-
tion factor in intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis signaling
pathways by initiating transcription of mRNAs that
encodeproapoptotic proteins such as PUMA, Bax, Fas/
CD95, PERP, and TRAIL, as well as cell cycle arrest
proteins including p21/Cdkn1a (Attardi et al., 2000;
Beckerman and Prives, 2010). Previous studies in a rat

model of optic nerve injury have suggested that p53 acts
through PUMA and Fas activation in apoptotic RGCs.
Consistently, RGCs in p53 null mice are partially resist-
ant to axotomy-induced death (Wilson et al., 2013, 2014).
To obtain an overview, we analyzed the regulation of p53
targets in our mouse models. Inspection of the RNA-seq
data revealed a strong increase of two main p53 targets,
p21 and PUMA after injury in controls, but not in
HDAC1/2 mutants (Figure 5(a)). Other p53 targets
including Perp, Fas, and Trail showed no significant dif-
ferences (Figure 5(a)). We validated the RNA-seq data by
qRT-PCR, including a second time point at 4 dpi
(Figure 5(b)). Of interest, Fas mRNA levels were not
changed at 2 dpi, but increased both in HDAC1/2
mutants and controls at 4 dpi (Figure 5(b)). To corrob-
orate the data at the protein level, we performed Western
blot analysis of retina samples. As on the mRNA level,
PUMA and p21were increased in controls at both time
points after injury, while there were no significant
changes in the HDAC1/2 mutants (Figure 5(c)). As
expected, Fas was upregulated in both HDAC1/2
mutants and controls at 4 dpi and also significantly at
2 dpi in controls with a trend in mutants (Figure 5(c)).
Since we used whole retina extracts for these analyses,
contributions by other cell types may mask partially
signal differences. Thus, we analyzed PUMA expression
in RGCs at the cellular level using immunohistochemis-
try. The injury induced a robust increase of PUMA in
FG-labeled RGCs in controls at 4 dpi, whereas HDAC1/
2-ablated RGCs showed no difference compared with
control intact retinae (Figure 5(d)). Collectively, these
data indicate that correct selective activation of p21 and
the proapoptotic target PUMA fails as an early response
after optic nerve injury in HDAC1/2 mutants, likely
mediated by altered p53.
Increased Acetylation at K381 Reduces the
Proapoptotic Activity of p53 in Axotomized
HDAC1/2 Mutants
Posttranslational modifications of p53 are essential for its
activation and appropriate acetylation of p53 on key
lysine residues of the C-terminal region is needed to
induce full transcription of its target genes (Gu and
Roeder, 1997; Knights et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006).
A recent in vitro study suggests that acetylation of p53
specifically on lysines K381 and K382 (the human equiva-
lent of mouse K379) inhibits its ability to activate tran-
scription of PUMA in cortical neurons (Brochier et al.,
2013). Following a related rationale, we analyzed post-
translational modifications of p53 in HDAC1/2-ablated
RGCs compared with control at 2 dpi and 4 dpi. Even
though the amount of p53 mRNA was decreased in
HDAC1/2 mutant retinae compared with controls, both
with and without injury (Figure 4(a) and (b)), we detected
no significant changes at the protein level (Figure 6(a)).
However, in control retinae at both time points analyzed
after injury, we found increased phosphorylation of p53
at serine (S15), which is correlated with the ability of p53
to trigger apoptosis (Olsson et al., 2007; Boehme and
Blattner, 2009; Figure 6(a) and (b)). These data are con-
sistent with findings in the rat model of axotomy (Wilson
et al., 2013). Furthermore, this p53 activation is in line
with the observed parallel increase of PUMA expression
(Figure 5(d)). HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs showed only
sparse p53 phospho-S15 signals by immunohistochemis-
try and no detectable change by Western blot analysis
(Figure 6(a) and (b)). Next, we analyzed the acetylation
pattern of p53 on the two key lysine residues, K381 and
K379. No significant differences comparing HDAC1/2
mutant and control retinae were detected on residue
K379 with or without axotomy (Figure 6(a)). However,
we found that axotomy triggered significant deacetylation
of K381 in control retinae, both at 2 dpi and 4 dpi.
HDAC1/2 ablation in RGCs revealed a trend of
increased acetylation early after injury (2 dpi), in line
with impairment of p53 activation and transcription of
its proapoptotic target PUMA. At 4 dpi, we discovered
that K381 acetylation was significantly reduced in
HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs by a yet unknown mechanism.
Discussion
The present study explored the functions of HDACs
during neurodegeneration. More specifically, we investi-
gated the role of HDAC1/2 in the regulation of adult
RGC survival in vivo using specific and accurate genetic
tools. Our study supports four major conclusions. First,
combined specific ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in
RGCs promotes neuroprotection following axonal
injury in vivo. Second, the JNK-p53-PUMA pathway is
activated following injury in axotomized mouse RGCs.
In HDAC1/2-ablated RGCs, p53 activation and the tran-
scription of its proapoptotic target PUMA are signifi-
cantly impaired. Third, this inability of HDAC1/2
mutants to activate p53 correlates with the abnormal
acetylation profile of p53 on K381. Fourth, HDAC1/2
inhibition provides a specific target for the development
of neuroprotective therapies.
HDACs inhibitors have been shown to be neuropro-
tective in different neurodegenerative models both in vivo
and in vitro, but the exact mechanisms of action are still
poorly understood (Chuang et al., 2009). Since HDACs
act on a wide variety of substrates including histones,
transcription factors, and cytosolic proteins, it is of para-
mount importance to evaluate their function in each spe-
cific cell type prior to the elaboration of new therapeutic
strategies. Therefore, to unravel the molecular mechan-
isms that underlie the neuroprotective potential of
HDAC inhibition, we created conditional knockout

mice for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGCs (Young et al.,
2008). Here, we show that efficient genetic ablation of
both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vivo promotes RGC sur-
vival following injury. These results are consistent with
recent studies using injection of the HDACs inhibitor ms-
275, active against HDAC1 and 3, or trichostatin A, an
inhibitor of Class I and II HDACs, in an optic nerve
injury model (Gaub et al., 2011; Chindasub et al.,
2013). Taken together, those studies showed that an over-
all increase in cellular acetylation enhances survival of
RGCs but did not provide definitive answers on specifi-
city issues. Others, also using trichostatin A, concluded
that histone deacetylation mainly by HDAC3 plays an
important role in the early gene silencing response of
apoptotic RGCs (Pelzel et al., 2010). Partially following
this rationale, we performed an RNA-seq analysis of our
retina samples to investigate the early response following
axonal injury in the control compared with the HDAC1/
2-ablated retinae. Another group recently published the
retinal transcriptome at 2 days after optic nerve crush
injury; pathway analysis revealed a cell death and sur-
vival response early after injury (Yasuda et al., 2014).
This study showed that ER stress was the major response
triggered, followed by other pathway alterations includ-
ing RGCs marker downregulation and immune response
activation. Our RNA-seq analysis in the axotomy model
revealed similar changes, sharing most the top upregu-
lated and downregulated targets in control retinae
(Yasuda et al., 2014). On the other hand, the mutant
intact retinae revealed that HDAC1/2 ablation per se
induced already major modifications of the transcription
profile. Interestingly, more genes were downregulated
rather than upregulated, confirming that HDAC function
is more complex than only inducting gene repression.

We cannot rule out that this gene expression shift played
a role in the neuroprotection effect observed after injury.
However, despite this global transcriptome difference, the
most significantly upregulated and downregulated genes
triggered by the injury shared a similar pattern in the
mutant retinae compared with controls. Indeed, we
found that the stress-activated protein kinase JNK, and
its targets are likely to play important roles in the answer
following injury. Our data corroborate previous observa-
tions showing that JNK and c-Jun are highly activated in
injured RGCs, and that deletion of Jnk2 and Jnk3 pro-
motes RGC survival (Fernandes et al., 2012). Here, we
confirmed that JNK and its target c-Jun are activated in
axotomized RGCs in both the HDAC1/2 mutant and
control retinae. In addition, the mRNA level of the proa-
poptotic target Hrk was also upregulated confirming pre-
vious observations in axotomized RGCs (Wakabayashi
et al., 2002). However, these targets could not explain
the neuroprotective phenotype observed in the HDAC1/
2 mutants. In stressed cells, JNK signaling can stabilize
and activate the proapoptotic transcription factor p53
(Fuchs et al., 1998b). We detected activation of p53 in
controls after injury, resulting in increases at both the
transcription and protein level of two of its targets, p21
and PUMA. In the HDAC1/2 mutant retinae, neither
p53 nor its targets were activated, leading us to the con-
clusion that p53 may be responsible for the neuroprotec-
tion effect observed.
The transcription factor p53 regulates neuronal apop-
tosis during nervous system development, as well as in
neurodegenerative conditions (Miller et al., 2000;
Morrison and Kinoshita, 2000). In the developing
retina, p53 is abundantly expressed and eventually
downregulated during maturation (O'Connor et al.,
2008). Wilson et al. (2013) recently demonstrated that
axotomized rat RGCs die in a p53-dependent manner
through activation of the proapoptotic targets PUMA
and Fas. They showed that RGCs abundantly express
ASPP1 and ASPP2, the apoptosis-stimulating proteins
of p53, and that selective knockdown of those targets
leads to RGC survival after injury in rats. In addition,
siRNA against PUMA or Fas conferred neuroprotec-
tion in that study. Consistent with these findings, our
data in mice also showed an increase in Fas and PUMA
in control axotomized RGCs, but only the increase in
PUMA was impaired in HDAC1/2 mutants. These data
corroborate the critical role played by PUMA in injury-
induced RGC loss (Wilson et al., 2013). Transcription of
Fas through p53 was not altered in the HDAC1/2
mutant retinae, which probably contributed to death
of RGCs. Further experiments may help to explain
why transcription of Fas remained in HDAC1/2
mutants, although posttranscriptional modifications of
p53 is well known to differentially activate Fas following
DNA damages (Kobayashi et al., 1998). Of note in this
context, Fas and p53 have been reported to signal apop-
tosis independently, depending of the cell type
(O'Connor et al., 2000).
Our data demonstrate that p53 activation is impaired
in HDAC1/2-ablated retinae. Regulation of p53 function
is exerted via a plethora of posttranslational modifica-
tions such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methyla-
tion (Olsson et al., 2007; Boehme and Blattner, 2009). As
one of the first nonhistone proteins that was shown to be
acetylated by histone acetyltranferase, p53 acetylation on
the C-terminus is commonly recognised as a stabilizing
and activating modification (Gu and Roeder, 1997;
Boehme and Blattner, 2009). However, more recent stu-
dies suggested that specific acetylation of p53 at different
sites can trigger or inhibit transcription of different target
genes in different cell type (Knights et al., 2006; Brochier
et al., 2013). To investigate whether changes in p53
acetylation status in the HDAC1/2 mutants might
account for the inability to trigger PUMA and p21
expression, we examined p53 acetylation at K381 and
K382. In cultured cortical neurons, specific acetylation
of p53 at K381 and K382 resulting from HDAC inhib-
ition prevented transcription of PUMA and p21 and lead
to neuronal survival (Brochier et al., 2013). The same
study showed that acetylation on the same site can trigger
the opposite effect in cancer cells, leading the authors to
conclude that specific acetylation of p53 in different cell
type can trigger different effects. We detected parallel
deacetylation at K381 and increase phosphorylation at
S15 of p53 in axotomized RGCs in control mice, pointing
toward the necessity of deacetylation of this lysine residue
for proper p53 activation. In contrast, in the HDAC1/2
mutants, K381 remained highly acetylated after injury
and no significantly increased phosphorylation of p53
was observed in RGCs, suggesting that HDAC1/2 is
likely to play a role in the deacetylation/activation of
p53 at K381 in RCGs. Further studies will be required
to determine the extent of direct connections between
temporal and spatial regulation of HDAC1/2 activity,
degree of p53 acetylation, PUMA expression, and RGC
survival. Also, additional analysis of other acetylation
sites might provide a better understanding of the p53
activation process in different neuronal populations
in vivo, but other possibilities may also be raised. For
example, specific acetylation of p53 could intervene in
the recruitment of neuron-specific cofactors, which
could in turn modulate the affinity of p53 for specific
promoters (Sims and Reinberg, 2008). Furthermore,
since lysine residues that can be subjected to acetylation
are also targeted by methyl-transferases, with opposing
effects on p53 function, it will be of interest to analyse the
methylation profile of p53. For example, methylation at
K372 can enhance p53-dependent transcription (Chuikov
et al., 2004), whereas methylation at K370 mediates
repression of transcriptional activity (Huang et al., 2006).

In summary, we have generated an efficient mouse
model for conditional recombination in adult mouse
RGCs. By contributing to the molecular understanding
of how specific ablation of HDAC1/2 is able to promote
adult RGC survival after injury in vivo, our study pro-
vides new insight into how HDAC inhibition can play a
neuroprotective function. Understanding how the bal-
ance of acetylation/deacetylation leads to neuroprotec-
tion is essential for the development of therapeutic
strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Our data sug-
gest that targeting specific acetylation of p53 at K381
represents a relevant target.
