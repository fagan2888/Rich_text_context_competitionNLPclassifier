Does Number of Children Increase the Rate of Coronary Heart Disease in Men?
Roberta B. Ne ss, 1 Janet Cobb,2 Tamara Har ris, 3 and Ralph B. D' Agosti no2



We examined the assnciatinn between number of children and cc1ronary heart disease risk among men in twn large prospective cohort studies. Data from the Framingham Heart Study com­ prised a group cl 1,632 men who were followed for 30 years; data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey National Epidemiologic Follow-up Study included

2,584 men who were followed for 3-5 years. We found no relation  between  number  of  children  and  coronary  heart disease incidence in these cohorts. This lack of  association  in men contrasts with the previous positive association found between pregnancy and coronary heart disease in women. (Epidemiology ! 995;6:442-445)


Keywords: coronary heart disease, men, parity, cohort studies, cerebrovascular disease.



Women with many pregnancies and livebirths have a modestly increased risk of developing coronary heart
disease and cardiovascular disease, according to three recent prospective cohort analyses. 1- 3 Increased insulin resistance, 45 increased body fat acquisition or changes in
body fat distribution, -6 8 and reductions in high-density­ lipoprotein cholesterol9 11 have been proposed as poten­
tial biological mediators of this association. Alterna­ tively, stress resulting from rearing many children may mediate the association.12
  Whether number of children also increases the risk of coronary heart disease in men has been explored  only once before.3 We  studied  the  relation  between  number of children and risk of coronary heart disease in men for two reasons: (1) to explore this potential risk factor in men, and (2)  to evaluate  the  role of potential  mediators of this association in women. We hypothesized that a positive association between number of children and coronary heart disease in men would support the medi­ ating role of exogenous factors such as stress and lessen the plausibility of mediation via biological sequelae of carrying the pregnancy.

Materials and Methods
STUDY POPULATION
Framingham Heart Study
Recruitment and examination procedures for the Fra­ mingham Heart Study are described in detail else­ where.13·14 We used the fourth biennial examination as a baseline for comparability with our  study  of  gravidity and cardiovascular disease in women. Of the 2,009 men who participated in the fourth biennial examination, we excluded those who had prevalent cardiovascular disease
(N  =  173), had  not  completed  having children  (N =
112), had missing information on number of children (N
= 37), or had missing covariates of interest (N = 55). No man in the sample had a cardiovascular endpoint before becoming a father. The baseline analytical sample comprised 1,632 men age 35-69 years. Follow-up to examination 19 (30 years) was accomplished by biennial interviews and physician examinations.


NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)
We  analyzed data from  the  first follow-up  in 1982-1984
of the first National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES I: 1971- 1975). 15·16 Participants were traced
through subject or proxy reports, medical records, and death certificates as part of the NHANES I Epidemio­ logic Follow-up Study. We used the 1982-1984 fol­ low-up interview as the baseline for this study because it was the only interview at which male respondents were asked about their number of children.
  We limited our attention to white men, for compara­ bility with the Framingham population. Of the 3,622 men ages 35-74 years who were alive in 1982-1984, we excluded 845 who had prevalent coronary heart disease, 8 for whom there was missing information on the num­ ber of children, and 185 with missing information on

one or more covariates. The final analytical sample comprised 2,584 men.

NUMBER OF CHILDREN

Framingham Heart Study
No distinction was  made  between  biological  and adopted offspring. Number of children was queried through examination 16.
NHEFS
Number of children was defined as the answer to the question, "How many children living or deceased have you had, not including adopted or stepchildren?"

OTHER VARIABLES
We defined possible confounding factors as delineated in our previous report of gravidity and coronary heart dis­ ease in women.2

CARDIOVASCULAR ENDPOINTS

Framingham Heart Study
We studied the first occurrence of coronary heart disease (N = 627), cerebrovascular disease (N = 247), or con­ gestive heart failure (N = 232), as previously defined. 17
NHEFS
We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th revi­ sion, codes from hospital discharge records or death certificates through 1987 to identify incident cases of
coronary  heart  disease  (N   =  228).  More  than  80% of
cases were defined on the basis of hospital records.2

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We grouped men into four categories by number of children (0, 1-2, 3-5, 2:6). We adjusted the mean values of covariates for each category for age by analysis of covariance. We evaluated trend using the extended Mantel-Haenszel chi-square st. 18
  
We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals relating the number of children to disease incidence19 and adjusting for a variety of covariates (see tables). The sampling weights were not used for the NHEFS analysis, as dis­ cussed by Korn and Graubard. 20 We entered baseline descriptive features into the models and used continuous follow-up. Subjects were censored at death or loss to follow-up.

Results
DESCRIPTIVE FEATURES

Framingham Study
Men studied at the fourth biennial examination had a mean of 2.3 children (range, 0-12). Men with the greatest number of children were older and had lower educational levels than did men with fewer children (Table 1).
NHEFS Study
Men participating in the NHEFS study had a mean of
2.6 children (range, 0-19), slightly higher than  the average among men enrolled in the Framingham study. Men with six or more children were also older and less likely to have graduated from  high  school  than  were men without children (Table 1). They were also more commonly current smokers and had higher body mass indices and higher systolic blood pressure.

CORONARY HEART DISEASE INCIDENCE

Framingham Study
Men with six or more children had a rate  of  coronary heart disease similar to that of men with no children  (crude rates per 1,000 person-years in  categories  of  0, 1-2,  3-5,  and   2:6  children:  21.1,  18.3,  18.2,  and 24.7).
The risk of coronary heart disease among those men with 6 or more children was little different than that among those with no children after adjusting for age and

education, and after adjusting for all study covariates (rate ratio = 1.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-1.8) (Table 2) . Similarly, for the outcomes of stroke and congestive heart failure, rate ratios were only slightly greater than 1.0 for men in the highest compared with the lowest category of number of children.
NHEFS Study
In this cohort also, there was no important difference between coronary heart disease rates  among  men  with the greatest numbers of children vs among men with no children (crude rates per 1,000 person-years in categories of 0, 1-2, 3-5, and 2::6 children: 26.6, 18.7, 21.1, 25.0).
Unlike the findings in the Framingham study, the age­ and education-adjusted risk as well as the multivariate­ ad jus ted risk of coronary heart disease (rate ratio= 0.7; 95% confidence interval = 0.4-1.3) was lower in men with six or more children than in men with no children.

Discussion
Our results are consistent with those of Dekker and Schouten,' who analyzed data from a 28-year follow-up study of Dutch civil servants and their spouses. In their study, the relative mortality among 1,200 women with four or more children, as compared with none, was 2.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0-5.8); among the hus­ bands, the relative mortality was only 1.6 (95% confi­ dence interval = 0.9-2.6).
  Like the findings of Dekker and Schouten,3 our cur­ rent results in men show no important association be­ tween number of children and coronary heart disease, whereas our previous results in Framingham and NHEFS women showed a consistent, modestly positive associa­ tion. In the Framingham study, differences in measure­ ment of number of children by gender may contribute to these differential results. In the NHEFS study, however,


questions for men and women were comparable, yet the association of coronary artery disease with number of children was positive for women and negative for men. What else might account for the difference between men and women with respect to number of children as a cardiovascular risk factor? First, these findings are con­ sistent with the possibility that biological changes coin­ cident with pregnancy have a long-standing effect on the cardiovascular system in women. Second, stress with childrearing may differentially affect men and women. 21 Also, men and women may differently involve their children in social networks, which have been shown to
protect against coronary heart disease in the elderly.22
