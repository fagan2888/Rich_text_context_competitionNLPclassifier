Introduction
Background
Nurses have great potential to contribute to the development
of health policy through political action. Nurses who do
engage in policy often do so through participation in their
employers' policy committees or through supporting nursing
professional organizations (Mechanic & Reinhard, 2002).
Professional nursing organizations worldwide have man-
dates and processes for nurses to engage at some level in
policy development (American Nurses Association [ANA],
2012a; Australian College of Nursing, 2012; Canadian
Nurses Association [CNA], 2012; Royal College of Nursing
[RCN], 2012). However, despite the efforts of professional
nursing organizations, it is still challenging to encourage
nurses to be politically active and to engage in health policy
issues for a variety of reasons (Vandenhouten, Malakar,
Kubsch, & Gallagher-Lepak, 2011). Cited barriers to nursing
involvement in health policy include a lack of political
awareness and understanding of the importance of being
involved in nursing organizations, time to engage in policy
development outside of nursing work, and resources to
develop skills in policy participation (Boswell, Cannon, &
Miller, 2005; Deschaine & Schaffer, 2003). This contributes
to registered nurses' (RNs) perception that their role is to
exclusively provide patient care, which leads to their inabil-
ity to see the "big picture" beyond the bedside regarding the
factors that determine how health care services are
distributed and how policies are generated and reformed
(Cramer, 2002). Nurses also do not have a clear understand-
ing of how they can inform discussions of health care ser-
vices planning and delivery and often see this as the "decision
makers" job (Hewison, 2008; Maslin-Prothero, Ed, &
Masterson, 2002). To be successful in political engagement,
nurses must understand both the policy process and how to
influence key decision makers. Professional nursing organi-
zations could play a key role in helping to bridge these gaps,
so nurses, in whatever role and sector they work in, can be
actively engaged in health policy to positively affect the pro-
fession and the health of their country's citizens.
While nurses make up the largest group of health care
providers in most developed countries, they often do not
engage in health policy, political participation, or political
activism (Spenceley, Reutter, & Allen, 2006). In 2010, there
were 287,344 RNs, including nurse practitioners (NPs), in
Canada, with an average increase from 2007 to 2010 of
approximately 4.8% (CNA, 2012a). In comparison, in the
same year there were 68,000 physicians in Canada (Canadian
Institute for Health Information, 2010), therefore a 4 to 1

Nursing Professional Organizations: What
Are They Doing to Engage Nurses in
Health Policy?
Cristina Catallo1, Karen Spalding1, and Roya Haghiri-Vijeh1
Abstract
Nurses have great potential to contribute to the development of health policy through political action. We undertook a
systematic website review of international- and national-level professional nursing organizations to determine how they
engaged registered nurses in health policy activities, including policy priority setting, policy goals and objectives, policy
products, and mechanisms for engaging nurses in policy issues. We reviewed 38 organizations for eligibility and 15 organization
websites met our inclusion criteria. Six professional nursing organizations had comprehensive websites with a discussion of
specific policy goals and objectives, policy-related products and mechanisms for nurses to become engaged. Future research
is needed to evaluate how nursing professional organizations establish policy priorities and to evaluate the effectiveness of
the strategies used to politically engage nurses.

ratio of nurses to physicians. Comparable ratios exist in other
developed countries with 3.1 million nurses in the United
States in 2008 and 954,226 physicians (American Medical
Association, 2010) resulting in just over 3 to 1 ratio of nurses
to physicians. In Australia, the ratio is 3.8 to 1 with 276,751
nursesin2009and72,739physicians(AustralianGovernment
and Australian Institute of Health and Wellness, 2012). Even
though the number of nurses far outpaces the number of phy-
sicians, it continues to be the medical profession that has the
dominant voice and therefore influence when it comes to
decisions related to health policy and health system changes.
There have been many authors who have written about this
domination, and although not the focus of this article, it is
important to highlight that if more nurses were politically
engaged what difference they could make (Lewis, 2010;
Lum & Williams, 2000; Tuohy, 1999).
As pointed out, a key mechanism for political engage-
ment of nurses is through national organizations that are
members of the International Council of Nurses (ICN).
However, in Canada, for example, there are approximately
285,000 nurses but just over half (145,000) belong to the
CNA. According to MacDonald, Edwards, Davies, Marck,
and Guernsey (2012), low levels of member participation in
nursing organizations limit the overall impact that nursing
organizations can make on health and nursing policy issues.
Nursing professional organizations, such as the ANA, the
CNA, the Australian College of Nurses (CAN), and the
United Kingdom's Royal College of Nurses, represent nurses
on policy issues and can engage nurses to be politically
active at the national and international levels. For example,
the CNA has various forums to give nursing a voice at a
national level and provide "tools" for nurses to have an
impact on policy decisions, and the ANA offers RNs support
on how to be politically active and lobby the government. A
feature of some national- and international-level professional
nursing associations is to make available key research evi-
dence about promising nursing practices as well as ideas
about improving the health and health care system that nurses
could utilize in trying to influence decision makers. One way
for professional nursing associations to be involved is to
offer opportunities for nursing knowledge and expertise to be
shared with government officials and the policy community
through think-tank sessions, national task groups, and sum-
mits. This would allow nurses to contribute to the shaping of
policy ideas and plans for engaging policymakers. In addi-
tion to engaging nurses to become politically active, a key
function of the national and international nursing profes-
sional organization is to develop policy products such as
briefing notes, position statements, and research summaries
on pressing current health care policy issues to support poli-
cymaker decision making.
One strategy for nurses to engage in health and nursing
policy issues is through accessing a national professional
nursing organization--often through the first point of
entry--the organization's website. However, little is known
about the web-based strategies that national nursing organi-
zations use to engage nurses in health and nursing policy
issues. Despite a thorough search of the literature, no research
studies were found on this issue to inform our article. The
majority of articles describing political engagement among
nurses were greater than 5 years of age, indicating a limited
amount of research on this topic. Research is needed to better
understand what priority setting strategies, policy products,
and web-based mechanisms that national nursing organiza-
tions use on their websites to engage nurses in health and
nursing policy issues.
Purpose of Study
The purpose of this study was to examine, through the review
of websites, how national professional nursing organizations
engage nurses in health and nursing policy. We examined
websites for the following four activities: (a) policy priority
setting strategies, (b) policy goals and objectives, (c) policy
products, and (d) mechanisms for engaging nurses in policy
issues.
Method
Design
This study utilized a "systematic website review" of interna-
tional- and national-level professional nursing organizations.
While there is no formalized method for a "website review,"
we chose to undertake a systematic process which we called
a "systematic website review." Unique to our process was the
use of inclusion/exclusion criteria, two data extractors to
independently extract data, and a matrix to record data
extraction.
Sampling and Procedures
Identification, inclusion, and data extraction from websites
involved a systematic and iterative process involving two
reviewers (C.C., R.H.V.) using a third reviewer (K.S.), if
needed, when disagreement arose that could not be resolved
through discussion. All disagreements between the two
reviewers were resolved through discussion. Two reviewers
(C.C., R.H.V.) independently identified potentially relevant
international- and national-level professional nursing organi-
zations using the following Internet search engines: Google
and Yahoo. A matrix was created to record the websites for
international-level professional nursing organizations and
national-level professional nursing organizations in North
America (e.g., United States, Canada), Europe, and the South
Pacific (e.g., Australia and New Zealand). Using this matrix,
the reviewers recorded the organization website and scored
each against the following eligibility criteria: (a) websites in
English or enough pages translated into English that data
could be extracted, (b) websites that were professional
Catallo et al. 3
nursing organizations at the international and/or national
level, (c) professional nursing organizations that focused on
the advancement of the nursing profession as a whole as
opposed to specific sub-specialties or topical issues in nurs-
ing, and (d) professional nursing organizations that focus on
more than regulatory, licensure, or union/labor issues but
also considered other nursing and health care issues, and/or
nursing and health policy issues. We decided to focus on
those national- and international-level organizations that
concentrated their mandates and activities across multiple
nursing issues that could have an impact on the profession as
a whole, as well as nursing and health policy, as opposed to
those organizations whose emphasis is on the advancement
of clinical sub-specialties. While these specialty organiza-
tions are also important, their focus varies widely and it is
sometimes difficult to assess the impact that these sub-spe-
cialty organizations might have on health policy reform and/
or changes to the profession overall. Organizations that met
these four criteria as determined by the two reviewers were
included in the website review and will be referred to as
"included organizations" throughout the article.
Data Extraction
We created a data extraction tool for the two reviewers (C.C.,
R.H.V.) to independently extract data from the included orga-
nizations. A guide for data extraction is provided in Table 1.
The following types of information were collected using our
data extraction tool: (a) level of the organization (e.g., inter-
national, national, country name); (b) name and website of
the professional nursing organization; (c) organization's
vision; (d) organization's mission; (e) organization's man-
date, objective, and goals; (f) specific policy goals; (g) policy
products; (h) webpages focused on political activity; and (i)
mechanisms for nurses to engage in political activities. A
sample data extraction tool is provided in Table 2. For the
organization's mission and vision, we sought to identify any
strategic planning documents or materials that discussed how
the organizations determined which issues they selected for
priority and focus for policy advocacy. For the organization's
mandate, we recorded when the website discussed any legis-
lation governing the organization's activities or goals and
whether or not the organization focused on nursing issues,
public interest issues, or both. We defined policy products to
include any document that presented a nursing or health pol-
icy issue and a nursing response to the issue such as briefing
notes, fact sheets, and position statements. We extracted data
on political activities carried out by the professional nursing
organizations and the nature of these activities such as bring-
ing awareness to a policy issue, political advocacy, and the
engagement of nurses. Finally, we identified the types of
mechanisms that organizations used to engage nurses in polit-
ical action such as petition signing, rallies, and presentations.
While data extraction was completed, the two reviewers met
to review each independent extraction for consistency and
thoroughness. Using the two extraction templates, a final

Criteria Description (cut and paste data directly from websites)
National nursing
organization
Must be a national level professional organization. Do not extract data from an organization that focuses on
regulating and licensing nurses only or nursing unions only. The organization was included if it deals with
professional nursing issues only or a combination of nursing professional issues and another issue (e.g.
regulation).
Vision/mission Include organization's vision and/or mission statement and any discussion of how the organization sets
priorities (e.g. decides what issues become the ones to focus on.) This includes: strategic planning
documents, goal statements, annual objectives etc. State when these are not available on the website (e.g.
vision not available, mission not available, strategic planning or goal statement documents not available).
Mandate Include organization's mandate or objectives/goals statements and any discussion of how the organization
sets priorities and the focus for the organization (e.g. nursing issues alone or public interest). Cut and
paste mandate or state when not available on website. Cut and paste any legislation that sets the purpose
for the org (e.g. any acts or laws) or state when not available. Cut and paste any discussion of whether the
organization focuses on nursing alone or nursing and public interest or just public interest and state when
not available.
Policy goals Include any policy goals that are listed in other places other than the mandate/vision section that outline the
org's focus on policy.
Policy products Include any policy products that the org uses to be politically active (e.g. briefing notes, position statements,
policy papers, letters to policymakers, videos, social media like facebook etc.) describe these as best as
you can
Webpages based on
political activities
Include any web pages that outline what the organization is doing in relation to policy or political activism
(e.g. meeting with the politician, inviting politician to a meeting, hosting a webinar, encouraging members
to get involved.)
Mechanisms for
nursing to engage
Include any info about how nurses can be more involved in helping the organization be politically active.

overall extraction template was developed for each included
organization and used in analysis. Data were then coded and
entered into SPSS Version 20.0 according to the categories of
the data extraction tool.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics using SPSS were conducted for the
organizations to give a summary of the policy priorities,
goals, products, and mechanisms used by organizations for
engaging nurses in policy issues. Qualitative information
contained in the data extraction templates was analyzed
using a constant comparison method to identify the main
areas addressed by professional nursing organization and the
presentation of gaps when seeking to engage nurses in nurs-
ing and health-policy-related issues.
Results
Our review resulted in 38 international- or national-level
professional nursing organizations being selected for poten-
tial eligibility. Using our eligibility criteria, 15 organizations
were included (39.5%) and 23 were excluded (60.5%).
Among the included organizations, three organizations
focused on international-level nursing issues, two were at the
North American level, one focused on Australia and
represented our South Pacific category, and nine focused on
European-level professional nursing issues. Among the
excluded organizations, one from New Zealand did not pos-
sess more than a webpage and no other information about the
organization to support inclusion. The remaining excluded
organizations (n = 22) were from European countries and
were found to be ineligible because the professional nursing
organizations' websites lacked at least one of the following
characteristics: a description of the organization and its
activities (n = 6), webpages presented in English (n = 9),
complete translation of all webpages in English (only a few
webpages were presented in English and we could not evalu-
ate inclusion; n = 2), focus on nursing or health policy issues
(main focus was on nursing regulatory or union/labor issues;
n = 5).
Table 3 outlines the frequency with which included orga-
nizations described their vision, mission, mandate, specific
policy goals, and products and mechanisms for nurses to
become politically engaged through the organization. The
majority of included organizations provided a statement of
vision, mission, and an overall mandate. Few included orga-
nizations outlined the process used to identify nursing policy
issues for priority, specific organizational goals related to
nursing or health policy, policy products or mechanisms for
RNs to become politically engaged. Two included organiza-
tions (Finnish Nurses Association and the German Nurses

Refer to data extraction guide (Table 1). If no data are available on the organization website enter "not available" or "not stated." For
vision/mission/mandate, cut and paste what is on the website and enter into the table below. Include comments on three areas:
1.
Include any priority setting mechanisms in place for how the organization makes decisions about which issues to focus on through
strategic planning docs or some policy advisory committee (if nothing exists then put "priority setting--not stated").
2.
Include any acts/laws or legislation that support the organizations activities (if nothing exists then put "laws--not stated").
3.
Include whether the organization focuses on nursing issues alone or nursing issues and public policy or nursing issues and regulatory
issues (licensing) or something else. At minimum, the organizations should focus on professional nursing issues but it would be
interesting to see which ones focus exclusively on nursing versus those that focus on nursing and public policy or regulation issues too.
Enter the organization name and the website address. Note when there are no English webpages or not enough English to fill out the

Association) had some webpages that were partially in
English and partially in another language without additional
translation. However, six organizations' websites were iden-
tified that met all of our criteria and performed a number of
functions in relation to engaging nurses politically from
explicitly described political action or engagement in their
organizational vision, mission, and/or mandate to outlining
policy-related products and ways for RNs to become more
involved. These were the ICN (international level), the CNA,
the ANA (North American level), the CAN (South Pacific
level), the European Forum of National Nursing and
Midwifery Associations (EFNNMA), and the United
Kingdom's RCN (European level).

this strategic plan, including the identification of policy
trends, defining opportunities to be political active and admin-
istering press releases and fact sheets declaring ICN's posi-
tion and the role it plays in influencing health and social
policy. Various projects detailing the ICN policy position are

listed on the ICN website, some of which include counterfeit
medicines, international nursing migration, non-communica-
ble diseases, and wellness for health care workers. Upon
review of policy products, ICN provides position statements,
fact sheets, press releases, and presentations on some of its
topics. ICN offers opportunities for nurses to engage in net-
works, and one network in particular is focused on nurse poli-
ticians. The ICN website lists events such as upcoming
conferences and their location.
Canadian Nurses Association (CAN)/Association Des Infirmières
et Infirmers Du Canada.The CNA describes a mission and
vision that includes discussion of political advocacy with a
focus on healthy public policy and a quality health care sys-
tem. Its organizational goals from 2010 to 2014 are listed,
including a goal specific to advancing health public policy at
national and international levels. The CNA provides a pub-
licly available annual report which outlines the organiza-
tion's accomplishments in the past year, including how it has
advocated for public policy such as encouraging nurses to
engage in debate during the national election, discussions on
health care system transformation, NP legislation, and nurs-
ing regulation issues. The CNA devotes a section of its web-
site, which is named "On the Issues," to outline specific
policy goals and describes the areas of nursing and health
care policy where it focuses its activities. Some of these
activities include a national expert commission to explore
nursing contributions to the health care system, staffing and
patient outcomes, emergency preparedness, interprofessional
practice, chronic disease prevention, healthy aging, and
pharmaceutical access. The CNA has webpages focused spe-
cifically on the organization's political action activities and
the process that it uses to engage health policymakers. Nurses
are invited to be politically involved with the CNA's activi-
ties with detailed instructions for writing letters to political
representatives, working with the news media, and meeting
with policymakers. Policy products include CNA open let-
ters, position statements, briefing notes, research summaries,
and fact sheets.
American Nurses Association (ANA). The vision and mission of
the ANA includes a discussion of policy advocacy to pro-
mote the rights of the nurse in the workplace, the image of
nurses, and lobbying government for changes on nursing and
health-related issues. A summary of the past year's annual
report is provided online and discusses political advocacy
activities such as lobbying for the "Affordable Care Act,"
representation of nurses in Accountable Care Organizations
and for reimbursement to advanced practice RNs. The ANA
has webpages dedicated to policy and advocacy, and these
provide downloadable testimonies that the ANA has pre-
sented before congress on various topics such as the clean air
act, Medicaid, Health Care Reform, Clean Water Act, and
Nursing Workforce Development Programs. Policy products
that theANAoffers include a "policy activist tool kit" (ANA,
2012b). As part of this tool kit, RNs are provided with
resources that include how to get involved in a political cam-
paign, writing letters to the editor, how to engage politicians
and carry out lobbying activities. From the political activist
tool kit website, RNs can seek to sign up for the ANA's
Nurses Strategic Action Team to help nurses engage across
the United States.
Australian College of Nursing (ACN). The ACN is an organiza-
tion which has formed after the merger of the Royal College
of Nurses Australia (RCNA) and The College of Nurses
(TCoN). The vision, mission, and mandates of the ACN refer
to advancing the nursing role in health policy through advo-
cacy. From a publically available annual report from 2011,
the ACN cites activities related to influencing policy devel-
opment and formation and advocating for nursing-related
issues (Royal Colleges of Nurses of Australia, 2011). The
ACN's ongoing policy activities include lobbying political
leaders and decision makers, providing feedback for health
sector consultations, and participating in a range of high-
level national, states, territories, and non-government com-
mittees significant to the nursing and health professions and
encourages and supports its members to submit articles for
publications. The ACN's website provides policy products
such as guidelines for nurses interested in lobbying activi-
ties, position statements, fact sheets, and invites its members
to apply to advisory committees with potential to affect pol-
icy decisions.
European Forum of National Nursing and Midwidery Associa-
tions (EFNNMA). The EFNNMA was created in November
1996 and includes 26 national nursing and midwifery asso-
ciations and World Health Organization (WHO; 2012)
with a signed declaration to join in action of promoting
health and health care in Europe. Their aim and mission is
to strengthen and promote the exchange of information,
ideas, and policies between national nursing/midwifery
associations and WHO. The EFNNMA also strives to inte-
grate appropriate policies, to formulate policy statements
and recommendations on health of the population at a
national level, and to initiate projects of evidence-based
practice for nurses and midwifery. The EFNNMA claims
that each year they focus on one theme then formulates a
statement on it and works with nursing and midwifery
associations to take forward their recommendations to
affect the national policy and practice. The recent years'
focus of themes has been international code on recruitment
of health personnel, stewardship and governance, health
systems, health and wealth, HIV/AIDs, maternal, child and
adolescent health with a focus on obesity, and mental
health. Areas not well described include the mechanisms
for nurses to engage in political activities and publically
available policy-related products. While we were able to
locate a few reports, other policy products were not dis-
played on the EFNNMA website.
Catallo et al. 7
Royal College of Nursing (RCN).The RCN's vision and mis-
sion involves the interest of the diverse voice of nurses by
influencing and implementing policy through lobby govern-
ment and stakeholders to improve the quality of patient's
outcome. RCN clearly articulates a health policy focus in its
vision, mission, and mandate. Policy products available for
download include fact sheets, briefing notes, and consulta-
tion documents. Example topics include health workforce
issues, the future of nursing, and welfare reform. In addition
to policy products, mechanisms for nurses to be more
involved in health policy include applying to be a representa-
tive of the organization on committees, invitations to join
committees or task group, or be elected to council. The RCN
also encourages its members to provide consultations on cur-
rent issues and provides its members with current news,
events, and campaigns.
Discussion
This website review of international- and national-level pro-
fessional nursing organizations provides a first examination
of organizational practices and activities undertaken to politi-
cally engage RNs in nursing and health policy issues. Six
organizations were identified to meet all of our criteria,
including establishing clear policy goals and mandates, offer-
ing policy-related products on nursing and health-related
issues, and implementing activities to engage nurses in pol-
icy-related activities. Typically, professional nursing organi-
zations provided a description of their organization's vision,
mission, organizational mandate and goals on their website.
Professional nursing organization websites varied regarding
how well they described specific policy goals and objectives
as part of their organizational mandate. While some organiza-
tions provided publically available documents detailing their
organization's activities, such as annual reports and strategic
plans, no organization explicitly discussed how they priori-
tized nursing or health policy decisions within their organiza-
tion. This includes the processes undertaken by organizations
and the decisions made for which issues would be the primary
focus for the organization as a representative of RNs nation-
ally and internationally. Priority setting is an important pro-
cess for nursing professional organizations to consider as it
involves activities that identify which health service issues
should receive priority, which nursing issues require urgent
attention, and who as patients need immediate attention over
others. Our finding is consistent with other authors who iden-
tified that there is limited research evidence on the priority
setting activities identified by professional nursing associa-
tions and the factors that influence these decisions which
could affect how well nursing associations implement their
organizational mandates and goals (MacDonald et al., 2012;
Mitton, Patton, Waldner, & Donaldson, 2003; Peacock,
Mitton, Bate, McCoy, & Donaldson, 2009). Likely, many
professional nursing organizations undertake one or more
processes to support priority setting but do not describe these
on their organization's website. An area for future research
would be to examine what these priority setting practices are,
how they affect the work of the organization and how well the
determined policy priority areas reflect the organization's
vision, mission, and mandates.
Despite organization websites offering a limited descrip-
tion of their priority setting activities, the six organizations
that met our criteria provided a number of policy products
that discussed their position on various nursing and policy
issues and methods for nurses to engage in these policy
issues. Common policy products were position statements,
briefing notes, fact sheets, media releases, and research evi-
dence summaries. A common way to engage nurses was to
provide "tips" to writing letters to government representa-
tives, lobby government on nursing issues, policy and legis-
lation, and how to meet with government representatives.
Some organizations presented information about confer-
ences and events for nurses to attend but these were not
always focused on the policy activities of the organization.
One organization, the ANA, provided a "policy advocacy"
tool kit but this was housed on a website separate from the
organization. Few websites provided a means for nurses to
collaborate on nursing and health policy issues such as
through networks, coalitions, and partnerships. Our findings
are consistent with other authors who describe similar
attempts to advocate for nursing and health policy issues
(MacDonald et al., 2012; Vandenhouten et al., 2011). One
limitation arising from our review is that organizations'web-
sites may not accurately portray the intensity with which
organizations may engage on certain nursing or health-pol-
icy-related issues. This includes a need to understand the fac-
tors that influence which policy products nursing
organizations select to use and the decisions made about the
packaging and sharing of policy products. According to
Vandenhouten et al. (2011), nursing participation in health
policy was influenced by psychological engagement, includ-
ing nurses who were interested in health policy issues and
confident that their actions might make a difference. This
could be an important factor for professional nursing asso-
ciations to consider when attempting to engage nurses. From
our website review, while organizations describe their activi-
ties to advance policy issues and present the importance of
nurses to take action, no included organization explicitly
described the specific impact on the advancement of nursing
and health policy issues that would result from nursing
engagement in the organization and the policy advocacy
activities. Greater efforts to support nursing psychological
engagement might encourage more nursing participation in
policy advocacy activities. Our results also revealed that few
nursing professional organizations evaluate how well their
policy advocacy activities are effective in stimulating greater
nursing political activity. Future research to evaluate the
impact of the policy products and mechanisms to engage
nurses offered by international- and national-level nursing
organizations is needed.

Our study presented a first look at international- and
national-level nursing professional organizational websites
for their policy priority setting activities, specific policy
objectives, products, and mechanisms for engaging nurses in
policy issues. However, a limitation of our study is our
emphasis on organizations with an English-language web-
site. There were a number of websites from Europe which we
had to exclude from our review because there were not
enough webpages in English to determine inclusion. Future
research might include attempts to have individuals fluent in
these languages interpret the websites for inclusion and be
involved in data extraction when applicable. Our study was
also limited by the amount of information that organizations
chose to place on their websites. Many times organizations
carry out a number of activities behind the scenes that are not
declared or presented on their websites. Improvements could
involve study methods that incorporate additional methods
such as survey or interviews alongside the website review to
obtain a broader perspective of the organizational activities
undertaken.
Implications for Nursing Policy
To facilitate political engagement, nurses need a greater
exposure to the principles of and current issues related to
health policy through education at the undergraduate and
graduate levels. Nurses often cite a lack of political aware-
ness, including the internal workings of the government
and how policy decisions are made (Abood, 2007; Cramer,
2002). Nurse leaders who work with nursing professional
organizations and nurse educators need to cultivate greater
political interest and engagement beginning with under-
graduate-level nursing students and continuing with prac-
ticing nurses (Deschaine & Schaffer, 2003; Duncan,
Thorne, Van Neste-Kenny, & Tate, 2012; Vandenhouten
et al., 2011). Introduction of a health policy course within
the nursing curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate
levels can help facilitate political engagement through
broadening student awareness of current health policy
issues and the policy processes used to address these prob-
lems. Professional nursing organizations can play a role in
providing ongoing continuing education for nurses in prac-
tice to address knowledge gaps (Vandenhouten et al., 2011).
Educational strategies can focus nursing awareness on the
typical pressures faced in a policy environment such as
fast-paced setting, multiple competing demands, limited
time to make influential decisions, and a need for timely
evidence for decision-making (Catallo & Sidani, 2014).
With a better understanding of the policy process and the
policy arena, including the pressures surrounding decision-
making and multiple competing drivers, nurses can identify
and develop a role that facilitates ongoing political engage-
ment. Some examples of areas that nurses could improve
their skills include activities that support the articulation of
a current health problem using a nursing and policy lens,
identifying options that policymakers would deem relevant
within the broader health system to address the nursing and/
or policy problem, and describing local implementation
considerations in a succinct manner, should an option be
selected. These areas of focus are consistent with interna-
tional initiatives such as the SUPPORT Tools for evidence-
informed health Policymaking (STP) series by the
SUPportingPOlicyrelevantReviewsandTrials(SUPPORT)
project, an international collaboration funded by the
European Commission's sixth Framework (http://www.
support-collaboration.org; Lavis, Oxman, Lewin, &
Fretheim, 2009). These SUPPORT Tools are a series of 19
articles describing the types of information that health poli-
cymakers need to know, what evidence is required for
health policy decision-making, and specific interventions
such as development of policy briefs and policy dialogues
which facilitate health-policy decision-making. The
SUPPORT Tools material could be helpful to include as
part of nursing education and skill development to better
equip student and practicing nurses to articulate and
respond to nursing and policy-related issues. The SUPPORT
Tools can be found in the Health Research Policy and
Systems Journal Volume 7 Supplement 1: http://www.
health-policy-systems.com/supplements/7/s1
Conclusion
This study offers a first review of international- and national-
level professional nursing organizations and how they
engage nurses in health and nursing policy through their
policy priority setting strategies, policy goals and objectives,
policy products, and mechanisms for engaging nurses in pol-
icy issues. This study offers promising results, in that many
nursing organizations are actively working to address nurs-
ing and health-policy-related issues. Continued work is
needed to promote nursing engagement and to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies used by professional nursing
organizations to support political activity.
