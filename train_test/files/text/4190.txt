Abstract
Objective: To assess possible changes in leptin and ghrelin secretion due to etanercept in juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
Methods: 50 patients with JIA and 16 age-matched controls were enrolled into this prospective,
cross-sectional study. Serum leptin, total and acyl ghrelin were measured in addition to white blood
cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts.
Results: 25 patients received etanercept and 25 conventional therapies (including methotrexate)
for JIA. There was no difference between treatment and control groups in leptin or ghrelin levels
and no evidence of a relationship between leptin and ghrelin in patients with JIA. In all children with
JIA there was a correlation between leptin and body mass index (BMI). However, compared with
children in the conventional treatment group, children in the etanercept group showed a positive
correlation between total ghrelin and BMI and those with a low BMI showed a negative correlation
between acyl ghrelin and BMI.
Conclusion: No differences in leptin and ghrelin concentrations were found when patients with
JIA and controls were compared or when patients who received etanercept were compared with
those who received conventional treatment for JIA.

Introduction
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most
frequent chronic form of arthropathy in
children. 1 The disease is characterized by
joint pain and inflammation that develops in
a child younger than 16 years of age, lasts
longer than six weeks and is of unknown
cause.2 Some patients experience aggressive,
progressive and treatment resistant forms
of JIA. 1 For patients whose disease has
responded inadequately to, or who are
intolerant of the disease modifying drug,
methotrexate, current guidelines recom-
mend the tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa)
inhibitor, etanercept. 3 TNF is thought to
play an important role in the pathogenesis of
JIA and high levels have been found in both
the serum and synovial fluid of children with
JIA 2 Etanercept is a receptor protein p75 Fc
that binds to TNFa thereby blocking its
interaction with cell surface receptors and
attenuating its pro-inflammatory effects.2
Etanercept may also modulate biological
responses controlled by additional down-
stream molecules (i.e., cytokines, adhesive
molecules and proteinases) which are
induced or regulated by TNFa. 4
Leptin and ghrelin are hormones which
have a major influence on energy balance.5
Leptin synthesis depends on the obesity (ob)
gene and one of the factors stimulating
ob gene expression is TNFa. 6,7 Therefore,
any pharmacological influence leading to
a weakening of TNFa activity may cause
a change in leptin synthesis. 8,9 In addition,
leptin regulates endocrine and immune func-
tions.10-12 It also intensifies the inflamma-
tory response by monocyte and macrophage
activation, which, under its influence,
increases production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNFa, interleukin (IL)-1
and IL-6. 12 Ghrelin is a growth hormone­
releasing peptide and associated with appetite
regulation. 13 Acylated ghrelin consti-
tutes about 10-20% of total ghrelin and is
a powerful stimulant of appetite.14
Interestingly, loss of appetite is among the
most common nonspecific symptoms of JIA.
15 Ghrelin also exerts anti-inflammatory
properties by inhibiting the expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines including
TNFa 13 this action may be of benefit in
the treatment of JIA. 14
Therefore, treatment with anti-TNF
agents may influence serum levels of leptin
and ghrelin. 13 The aim of this current study
was to assess possible changes in leptin and
ghrelin secretion following treatment with
the anti-TNF drug, etanercept in children
with JIA.
Methods
This was a prospective, cross-sectional study
and involved children 6­18 years of age with
JIA who were treated at the Paediatric
Centre, Sosnowiec, Poland from 2009. The
JIA was classified according to International
League of Associations for Rheumatology
(ILAR) criteria.16,17 Nutritional status of
each child was assessed by the calculation
of body mass index (BMI).18 Healthy, age-
matched subjects with BMI< 23kg/m2 were
chosen for the control group.
In accordance with treatment guidelines,3
children experiencing an acute course of JIA
(i.e., symptoms from at least five affected
joints and at least three joints affected by
mobility dysfunction with accompanying
pain and sensitivity) were prescribed etaner-
cept. The drug was given subcutaneously at
526 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
0.4 mg/kg (up to 25 mg maximum dose).3
Dosing was twice weekly, the first dose was
administered on day zero and the second
dose was given on days 3 or 4. Subsequent
doses were given in following weeks at 3 to
4 day intervals.
During the study, venous blood sam-
ples were taken from the children and
white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte
counts were assessed using the Mindray
BC 2300 Haematology Analyser (Diamond
Diagnostics, MA, USA). Levels of serum
leptin, total ghrelin, acyl ghrelin were
assessed and the presence of antinuclear
antibody (ANA)-HEp-2 determined Leptin
was measured using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (Human
Leptin Elisa Kit, Millipore, Missouri, USA;
Human Leptin Receptor Elisa, BioVendor
Laboratory Medicine, Inc, Czech Republic)
according to the manufacturer's advised
methodology. Total ghrelin and acyl ghrelin
concentrations were assessed using ELISA
tests (Linco Research Inc., Missouri, USA).
Serum levels of ANA­Hep2 antibodies
were detected under a fluorescent microscope
using the Colorzyme HEp-2 ANA test system
(Immuno Concepts N.A. Ltd., California,
USA).
All patients and parents/guardians of
children under 16 years provided written
informed consent and the research was
approved by the Bioethical Commission of
Medical University of Silesia, Katowice no
KNW/0022/KB1/6/I/99.
Statistical analyses
To examine relationships between variables
both parametric methods and non-parametric
tests were used depending on the data. Data
analyses were performed using STATISTICA
(data analysis software system; version
12 (2014) StatSoft, Inc. USA). A P-value
<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Study population
Fifty children with JIA (34 girls and 16 boys)
were enrolled into the study. Eighteen chil-
dren had BMI !23 kg/m2 and 32 had
BMI<23 kg/m2 . Two children had systemic
JIA, 17 had oligoarticular JIA and 31 had
polyarticular JIA. Overall, 35 (70%) chil-
dren with JIA received oral glucocorticos-
teroids with approximately the same
number in each treatment group. Clinical
characteristics of the study groups are shown
in Table 1. Twenty-five children received
etanercept and 25 conventional therapies
for JIA which included methotrexate. The
control group consisted of 16 healthy, age-
matched children (11 girls and 5 boys) all
with BMI< 23kg/m.2 The ANA Hep-2 anti-
bodies were detected in 17 (68%) children in
the etanercept group, in 16 (64 %) children in
the conventional treatment group and none
of the controls.
For all children with JIA and BMI
< 23 kg/m2, the WBC count was statistically
significantly higher compared with healthy
controls (P < 0.05). The children in the
etanercept had statistically significant lower
BMI measurements and higher WBC counts
compared with children in the control group
(P < 0.05).
Leptin results
In the control group, a moderately positive
correlation was observed between leptin and
acyl ghrelin (Kendall's ; P <¼ 0.03). This
correlation was not detected in the two
treatment groups nor in the subgroup of
JIA patients with BMI<23 kg/m2.
In the etanercept group, a moderately
positive correlation was detected between
leptin and BMI (Spearman's rank correl-
ation; P <¼ 0.001). Similarly, in the conven-
tional treatment group, a strong positive
correlation was observed between leptin and
Maciejewska-Paszek et al. 527
BMI (Spearman's rank correlation, P< 0.001).
No such correlation was observed in the
control group.
Children in the etanercept group with a
low BMI (n ¼ 18) had statistically signifi-
cantly lower levels of leptin compared with
age matched controls (P < 0.05)
Ghrelin results
In all children with JIA, a strong positive
correlation was found between BMI and
total ghrelin (Pearson's linear correlation;
P < ¼ 0.03) and multiple regression analysis
showed a relationship between age and BMI
with total ghrelin as the dependent variable
(P ¼ 0.004). No such correlation was
observed in the control group.
Children in the etanercept group with a
low BMI (n ¼ 18) showed a moderately
negative correlation between BMI and
acyl ghrelin (Spearman's rank correlation;
P ¼ 0.04).
In the etanercept group, a strong positive
correlation between number of lymphocyte
and total ghrelin was detected (Spearman's
rank correlation; P ¼ 0.0002) as well as a
strong positive correlation between number
of lymphocyte and acyl ghrelin (Spearman's
rank correlation; P ¼ 0.0003). These correl-
ations were not found in the conventional
treatment group and controls.
Differences in types of JIA
The two children with systemic onset JIA
had high WBC counts and high CRP and
leptin concentrations (Table 2). Children
with polyarthritic JIA had statistically sig-
nificantly higher leptin concentrations
(Mann­Whitney U test; P ¼ 0.005), lower
total ghrelin (Mann­Whitney U test;

methotrexate is effective and well tolerated
in children with JIA 19-22 In this current
study, the population of children with JIA
was typical, in that it was characterized by
high levels of ANA Hep-2 and WBC counts.
15 In addition, the children with JIA and low
BMI had high WBC counts compared with
controls. These low leukocyte counts may
have been caused by the JIA or treatment
with glucocorticoids. 23 In addition, leptin
levels were significantly higher in the chil-
dren with JIA who received oral glucocortic-
oids compared with those who did not.
Overall, we found no difference in leptin
or ghrelin levels between treatment groups
and control subjects and no evidence of a
relationship between leptin and ghrelin in the
patients with JIA. Both treatment groups
exhibited positive correlations between leptin
and BMI. However, compared with children
in the conventional treatment group, children
in the etanercept group showed a positive
correlation between total ghrelin and BMI
and those with a low BMI showed a negative
correlation between acyl ghrelin and BMI. In
addition, children in the etanercept group
also showed a positive correlation between
WBC count and total and acyl ghrelin which
was not observed in the conventional treat-
ment group or in the control group.
Although earlier studies examining leptin
levels in relation to BMI in patients with
JIA have been negative, leptin levels may well
be a marker of nutritional status in these
patients. 24,25 For example, studies in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have shown
that serum leptin levels were directly related
to percent body fat but not to disease activ-
ity.26,27 In our previous study, we showed that
children with JIA and BMI< 23 kg/m2 had
lower leptin concentrations compared with
healthy subjects and children with a short-
term disease (2­18 months) had a higher
diversification of leptin concentration per
BMI unit compared with healthy controls.12
Serum ghrelin levels and the possible associ-
ation with anti-TNF treatment have been
explored in a previous pilot study involving
52 patients with JIA.13 The study showed that
serum ghrelin was low in patients with JIA
and following anti-TNF therapy values were
comparable with those in the control group.
However, a relationship between BMI and
ghrelin was not observed. Interestingly, in this
present study we found a positive and signifi-
cant correlation between BMI and total
ghrelin in all patients with JIA. In addition,
we also showed a negative correlation
between BMI and acyl ghrelin in patients
receiving etanercept with BMI< 23kg/m2
While our sample size was small, in this
current study, positive correlations were
shown in the etanercept group between the
number of lymphocytes and both total and
acyl ghrelin. These correlations occurred
irrespective of the differences in lymphocyte
counts and ghrelin concentrations between
study and control groups. Although the role
of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of JIA
has been confirmed, 15 the finding of a
relationship between ghrelin concentrations
and lymphocytes during anti-TNF treat-
ment encourages further studies in this
area, particularly because ghrelin receptors
have been demonstrated in murine spleen T
lymphocytes.28
In conclusion, no differences in leptin and
ghrelin concentrations were found between
patients with JIA and control subjects or
between those treated with etanercept and
conventional treatment. Nevertheless, fur-
ther studies with a large sample size are
required to confirm these results.
