OBJECTIVE -- We examined the relationship between health-related social disengagements,
as opposed to disengagements related to financial and other non­health-related factors, and
subsequent risk of disability and death among initially nondisabled elderly diabetic patients
enrolled in Medicare Managed Care plans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We used data from the Medicare Health
Outcomes Survey (HOS) Cohort 1 Baseline (1998) and Cohort 1 Follow-Up (2000). Through
mail and telephone surveys, trained interviewers collected information on sociodemographic
variables, physical and mental health functioning (using Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form-36 [SF-36]), activities of daily living (ADL), and medical conditions. This study reported
on diabetic subjects aged 65 years with no ADL disability at baseline (n  8,949). Health-
related social disengagement (degree to which physical health or emotional problems interfere
with social activities) was derived from the social functioning subscale of SF-36 (range 0­100;
higher scores depicting better social functioning).
RESULTS -- For each 10-point increase in social functioning score at baseline, older diabetic
subjects in our study experienced an 18% less chance of any ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]
0.82, 95% CI 0.75­0.89; P  0.001) and a 12% less chance of death (0.88, 0.78­1.00; P 
0.043) over a 2-year period, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, depression, and
general health (assessed by the SF-36).
CONCLUSIONS -- Among initially nondisabled older diabetic subjects, health-related in-
terferences with social activities at baseline may be early warning signs of subsequent ADL
disability and premature death, independent of other measures of health status.

The disablement process in patients
with diabetes involves several steps:
progressive accumulation of comor-
bidities (such as stroke, heart attack, renal
failure, and limb amputations), physio-
logic and anatomic impairments (such as
peripheral nerve dysfunction, peripheral
artery disease, and visual impairment),
and functional limitations (such as walk-
ing limitations and poor balance) (1­11).
Research on the disablement process has
influenced current research and clinical
efforts directed at reducing diabetes-
related disability and mortality. For ex-
ample, data from the Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial (DCCT) Re-
search Group and the U.K. Prospective
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group studies
showed that optimal control of blood
pressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid
levels significantly decreased the risks of
diabetic complications and diabetes-
related disability (1,4).
However, comorbidities secondary to
diabetes do not fully explain the relation-
ship between diabetes and disability
(5,6,9). For instance, Gregg et al. (6), in a
study of 527 women with diabetes aged
65 years, reported a 42% increased risk
of incident disability (inability to walk,
climb stairs, and perform household
chores, among others) over a 12-year pe-
riod, even after adjustments were made
for comorbidities (such as stroke and
heart disease), visual impairments, func-
tional status, and other potential con-
founders at baseline. These data suggest
that there may be other factors (such as
social functioning and health percep-
tions), in addition to the diabetic-related
comorbidities and impairments, which
might explain some of the variance in the
association between diabetes and disabil-
ity.
In an effort to begin to understand the
role of psychosocial factors in individuals
with diabetes, a study of 343 patients with
type 2 diabetes found that the social im-
pact of diabetes, as well as renal function,
diet regimen, age, and smoking history,
were more closely associated with mortal-
ity than level of diabetes control as mea-
sured by HbA1c
and other measures of
diabetes care (9). Because diabetes-
related pathologies, impairments, and
functional limitations do not fully ac-
count for the variance in the association
between diabetes and disability, it is pos-
sible that the effect of physical and emo-
tional health on social engagement may
explain some of the variance.
Social functioning or social engage-
ment (degree of participation in social ac-
tivities) has been shown to be associated
with disability and mortality (9,12­19).
For example, Glass et al. (12) reported, in
a group of 2,761 community-dwelling

persons aged 65 years, that increasing
levels of social activities (defined as
church attendance; visits to cinema, res-
taurants, and sporting events; day or
overnight trips; participation in social
groups; and playing games such as cards
or bingo) at baseline were significantly re-
lated to decreased mortality during the
13-year follow-up, adjusting for relevant
demographic factors and health status.
Another study reported significant cross-
sectional relationships between increased
participation in social activities and lower
risk of physical disability in a sample of
community-residing adults aged 65
years (19).
Degree of participation in social activ-
ities depends on several factors, including
living arrangement, occupational status,
neighborhood composition, physical en-
vironment, perception of health benefits,
and physical and mental health of the
participants (20­25). Prior studies of
determinants of participation in social ac-
tivities have focused mostly on economic,
environmental, and other non­health-
related factors and how these factors af-
fect disability and survival (17,18,20,23,
24,26). Little is known about how health-
related limitations on social activities
among nondisabled older adults affect fu-
ture risk of disability and death (27). Spe-
cifically, what is the relationship between
health-related social disengagements, as
opposed to disengagement related to fi-
nancial and other non­health-related fac-
tors, and subsequent risk of disability and
death among initially nondisabled elderly
diabetic patients?
We investigated the association be-
tween self-report of health-related curtail-
ment of social activities and risk of
disability and death over a 2-year period
in a large sample of older diabetic patients
enrolled in Medicare Managed Care ser-
vices. All subjects had no disability in ac-
tivities of daily living (ADL) at baseline.
We chose to use the managed care data to
minimize the confounding effect of access
to medications and other healthcare ser-
vices on quality of diabetes care.
We hypothesized that, among older
diabetic subjects who were initially non-
ADL disabled, those with better social
functioning (lower health-related social
disengagement at baseline using Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form-36 [SF-36])
would have lower risk of ADL disability
and better survival than those with poor
social functioning (high health-related so-
cial disengagement) over a 2-year period,
adjusting for relevant social demographic
factors, general health status (assessed by
the SF-36), and comorbidities.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data are from the Med-
icare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS), a
longitudinal cohort mail and telephone
survey of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled
in MedicareChoice (managed care)
plans in the U.S. Medicare HOS was spon-
sored by Health Care Finance Adminis-
tration (currently the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services [CMS]) and devel-
oped by National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA), a body responsible
for accreditation of managed care plans.
The Medicare HOS was designed to better
evaluate care quality by incorporating key
health outcome measures outlined in the
Health Plan Employer Data and Informa-
tion Set (HEDIS) in 1998.
Annual participation of Medicare
Managed Care Organizations in the HOS
has been mandated by CMS since 1998.
All Medicare managed plan enrollees,
who have been continuously enrolled for
at least 6 months, were eligible for sam-
pling, except those who were on Medicare
as a result of end-stage renal disease. For
baseline survey, in managed care plans
with more than 1,000 enrollees, the sur-
vey instruments were given to a random
sample of 1,000 subjects per plan; in
plans with 1,000 enrollees or fewer, the
surveys were conducted for all eligible
subjects. A full description of the Medi-
care HOS, rationale, methods, survey de-
sign, sample selection, and respondents'
characteristics can be found elsewhere
(28­31).
For the 2-year follow-up survey in
2000, subjects were restricted to enrollees
participating at baseline survey who were
still alive and enrolled in the original
managed care plan. We used an analytic
data file from the Medicare HOS Cohort
1 Baseline (1998) and the Cohort 1
Follow-Up survey 2 years later. Because
many managed care organizations dis-
continued or consolidated their health
plans between 1998 and 2000, the ana-
lytic data at the 2-year follow-up com-
prised 188 managed care markets and
134,076 completed surveys (30).
The NCQA-accredited HOS inter-
viewers used standardized question-
naires, survey letters, and follow-up
telephone calls (as outlined in the HEDIS
protocol, including a Spanish language
version) to collect information on several
variables including physical and mental
health functioning using SF-36 and ADL
impairments using specific symptoms re-
lated to various organs, presence of
chronic medical conditions, measure of
pain, cancer treatment, smoking, and
self-rated health and sociodemographic
variables.
This study reported on diabetic sub-
jects aged 65 years with no ADL disabil-
ity at baseline (n  8,949). After
excluding 155 subjects with incomplete
data on baseline social functioning, 8,794
subjects were analyzed for the outcome of
death. Due to missing data on social func-
tioning (n  53) and ADL (n  3), our
final sample (n  5,232) for the ADL anal-
ysis comprised those subjects who com-
pleted the 2-year follow-up interviews
and who had complete data on baseline
social functioning and follow-up ADL.
Causes of nonparticipation at the 2-year
follow-up surveys were disenrollment
(n  2,443), death (n  471), and refusal
or inability to contact (n  700). Forty-
seven subjects with no available data were
coded in the Analytic Database as "in-
valid." The characteristics between the
subjects who completed the 2-year fol-
low-up and the subjects who dropped out
from follow-up were compared. There
was no significant difference in social
functioning scores between the two
groups. However, the higher dropout
rates were found among nonwhites, sub-
jects with depression, and subjects with
cancers and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD).
Diagnosis of diabetes and other co-
morbidities were by self-report. We used
information on relevant sociodemo-
graphic variables, chronic medical condi-
tions, social functioning component of
SF-36 and other variables at baseline, and
data on ADL and mortality at the 2-year
follow-up interview (2000), as contained
in the Cohort 1 Analytic Public Use File
published by CMS, Health Services Advi-
sory Group, in January 2003 (30).
SF-36 Health Survey
The SF-36 is a 36-item measurement in-
strument used to assess health status and
health-related quality of life (32,33). The
SF-36 survey instrument (the whole in-
strument or its subscales) is among the
most frequently used health status mea-
sures in studies of older adults (31­35). It

has two summary scales, the Physical
Component Summary and the Mental
Component Summary, which were de-
rived from eight subscales: physical func-
tioning, role-physical, bodily pain,
general health, vitality, social functioning,
role-emotional, and mental health.
Social functioning subscale. The social
functioning subscale (range 0­100) was
derived from responses to two questions
such as, "During the past 4 weeks, to what
extent has your physical health or emo-
tional problems interfered with your nor-
mal social activities?" (responses range
from not at all to slightly, moderately,
quite a bit, and extremely) and "During
the past 4 weeks, how much of the time
has your physical health or emotional
problems interfered with your social ac-
tivities?" (responses range from all, most,
some, a little, to none of the time). Lower
scores on any or all of the scales indicate
poorer health functioning. Standardized
scores on SF-36 for the U.S. population
are used in most studies to calculate a nor-
malized score. A score of 50 represents
the national average for the summary
scores and for the subscales. A score that
is 10 points above or below the mean
score of 50 represents a difference of 1 SD
from the national average.
ADL scale. There were six ADL ques-
tions in the Medicare HOS. These in-
cluded walking, bathing, dressing, eating,
getting in or out of chairs, and using the
toilet. Respondents were asked to indicate
whether they could perform these activi-
ties without help, if they needed help, or if
they were unable to do them. "No disabil-
ity" was defined as needing no help, and
"any disability" was defined as needing
help with or unable to perform one or
more of the six ADL.
Death. The indicator of decease (without
the specific date of death) at the 2-year
follow-up interview (2000) was from the
Cohort 1 Analytic Public Use File pub-
lished by CMS, Health Services Advisory
Group, in January 2003 (30).
Covariates
Factors potentially associated with dis-
ability and mortality among individuals
with diabetes include sociodemographic
variables (age, sex, ethnicity, marital sta-
tus, years of formal education, smoking
status), comorbidities (hypertension, an-
gina or coronary artery disease, myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, COPD, arthritis,
cancer), and history of depressive symp-
tomatology, assessed by a positive screen
on a depression questionnaire (36). Posi-
tive depression screen was assessed by an
affirmative answer to any of the following
questions: 1) "In the past year, have you
had 2 weeks or more during which you
felt sad, blue, or depressed, or when you
lost interest or pleasure in things that you
usually cared about or enjoyed?"; 2) "In
the past year, have you felt depressed or
sad much of the time?"; 3) "Have you ever
had 2 years or more in your life when you
felt depressed or sad most days, even if
you felt okay sometimes?"
Statistical analysis
We examined demographic and health
factors for diabetic subjects, stratified by
ADL disability and death at 2-year follow-
up, using descriptive and t tests for con-
tinuous variables and contingency tables
(2) for categorical variables. Two logistic
regression models were used to predict
the risk of ADL disability and death. The
first model is unadjusted; the second
model added covariates that were signifi-
cantly associated with ADL limitation or
death in the bivariate analyses, i.e., age,
sex, marital status, smoking status, de-
pression, comorbidities, and general
health from SF-36. All analyses were esti-
mated using the SAS System for Win-
dows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).
RESULTS -- Descriptive demographic
and health factors for initially nondis-
abled older diabetic subjects, stratified by
incident ADL disability and death at
2-year follow-up, are shown in Table 1.
Significant bivariate correlates of ADL dis-
ability and death among older diabetic
subjects included older age, being unmar-
ried, depression, history of myocardial in-
farction and other heart condition, stroke,
COPD, arthritis of hip or knee, cancer,
and increasing number of comorbidities.
Ethnicity was not significantly associated
with ADL disability or mortality.
The difference in baseline social func-
tioning scores according to ADL disability
and death were also analyzed (data not
shown). Baseline social functioning
scores were significantly lower among the
disabled and the deceased (mean  SD,
49.9  9.5 vs. 52.9  7.5 for disabled
and nondisabled, P  0.001, and 49.0 
10.5 vs. 51.8  8.5 for deceased and
alive, respectively, P  0.001).
Table 2 shows, in the unadjusted
model (model 1), a significant association
between higher scores on social function-
ing measures (as a continuous variable)
and increased risk of ADL disability at the
2-year follow-up (P  0.001). After full
adjustments were made for age, sex, mar-
ital status, smoking, myocardial infarc-
tion and other heart conditions, stroke,
COPD, arthritis, cancer, depression, and
general health of the SF-36 (model 2), in-
creasing social functioning scores were
still predictive of lower odds of ADL dis-
ability at the 2-year follow-up. For each
10-point increase in social functioning
score at baseline, older diabetic subjects
in our study experienced 18% lower risk
of any ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]
0.82, 95% CI 0.75­0.89; P  0.001).
The results of two logistic regression
analyses predicting the risk of death are
also shown in Table 2. In model 1, in-
creasing scores on social functioning mea-
sures at baseline were significantly
associated with decreased odds of death
(P  0.001). With full adjustment for age,
sex, marital status, education, depression,
comorbidities, and general health (model
2), better social functioning at baseline
was associated with decreased risk of
2-year mortality. For each 10-point in-
crease in social functioning score at base-
line, older diabetic subjects in our study
experienced 12% lower risk of death (OR
0.88, 95% CI 0.78­1.00; P  0.043) over
a 2-year period.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our findings can
be summarized as follows: among com-
munity-dwelling initially nondisabled di-
abetic subjects aged 65 years in the
Medicare Managed Care program, higher
scores for measures of social functioning
(less health-related social disengagement)
at baseline were significantly associated
with better survival and less ADL disabil-
ity over a period of 2 years, controlling for
age, sex, marital status, depression, gen-
eral health, and comorbidities. There was
a stepwise decrease in the risk of future
ADL disability and death with better
scores on social functioning at baseline,
such that with each 10-point increase in
social functioning score (less health-
related social disengagement), older dia-
betic subjects in our study experienced
18% lower risk of any ADL disability and
12% lower risk of death over 2 years of
follow-up.

ations between lower level of social activ-

ities and increased risk of disability and
mortality (9,12,14­16,18,19,37). For ex-
ample, data from the New Haven Estab-
lished Populations for Epidemiologic
Study of the Elderly showed that in-
creased participation in social activities
(such as visits to theaters, game playing,
shopping, and church attendance, among
others) was associated with lower risk of
physical disability (19). Similarly, Len-
nartsson et al. (16), using data from the
Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions
of the Oldest Old, showed that increased
participation in social activities was asso-
ciated with reduced risk of death at 4-year
follow-up, adjusting for health variables
and other relevant confounders. Our re-
sults extend these studies to older initially
nondisabled individuals with diabetes
across the U.S. by showing that health-
related social disengagements are associ-
ated with higher risk of subsequent
disability and death, adjusting for rele-
vant confounders. In other words, among
elderly diabetic subjects with no self-
reported ADL disability, a decrease in so-
cial activities might be a forerunner of
subsequent loss of independent living
and premature death.
The mechanism for the association of
participation in social activities with
lower disability and mortality is not clear.
Past studies suggested that engagement in
social activities might be associated with
several factors, including an optimal
sense of self-competence and self-
efficacy, slower cognitive decline, and an
improved blood markers of immune and
stress response, factors known to improve
the odds for disability-free survival (38­
41). Our study included no data on mea-
sures of self-efficacy, blood markers, and
other factors to explore these factors as
possible mediators for the link between
health-related social disengagement and
our outcome measures.
On the other hand, it is possible that
decreasing participation in social activ-
ities by nondisabled individuals with
diabetes is a marker for severity of comor-
bidity, not just mere presence of a disease.
Therefore, an unrecognized medical con-
dition (i.e., subclinical stroke or sub-
clinical depression) might be causing a
decrease in both the ability (and the mo-
tivation) to engage in social activities and
the ability to perform ADL. In that sce-
nario, the decrease in social activities is
captured much earlier by assessing pa-
tients' responses to social functioning
questions during a period when the sub-
jects reported no ADL disability. How-
ever, over a 2-year follow-up period, with
progressive decrease in level of social ac-
tivities (with potential loss of the known
health benefits of participation in social
activities) as well as the persistence of the
unrecognized condition, deficits in ADL
performance accumulate, leading to
physical disability, loss of independence,
and death. We have no direct evidence in
our study that incident ADL disability
(and death) at follow-up is due to stroke
or any specific medical condition that can
potentially lead to decrease in participa-
tion in social activities and ADL ability.
Due to lack of data in our study on sever-
ity of diabetes (such as HbA1c
level), we
are not able to determine whether health-
related interference with social activities
is a marker for poor diabetes control
among older diabetic patients with no
self-reported ADL disability.
Our findings seem to indicate that
even when no ADL disability is clinically
evident, patients start, perhaps at an early
presymptomatic stage of disablement, to
adjust their levels of social activities in re-
sponse to their perceptions of physical
and emotional disturbances. Therefore,
inquiry about status of social activities in
older diabetic subjects by clinicians is one
way to identify individuals who will ben-
efit most from interventions to stem the
future loss of independence.
This study has some limitations. First,
the diagnosis of diabetes and comorbidi-
ties were by self-report. However, prior
research showed good agreement be-
tween self-reported diabetes and diabetes
diagnosed by blood tests (42,43). None-
theless, it is conceivable that subjects
might under-report comorbidities (such
as peripheral artery disease and periph-
eral neuropathy), partly because of un-
derdiagnosis and misattribution to aging.
It is also possible that, due to diabetes-
related nerve damage, the prevalence of
self-reported angina could be underesti-
mated. Second, we did not include data
on adherence to medication and duration
of diabetes, factors known to impact dia-
betes-related morbidity and mortality (1­
4). Medicare managed plan enrollees
receive coverage for drugs, and this im-
proved access should minimize the im-
pact of differences in medication
availability on our outcomes. Third, the
Medicare HOS database has no detailed
information on types and frequency of so-
cial activities. Fourth, the results of the
association between health-related social
disengagement and ADL disability might
only be generalized to the diabetes popu-
lation without severe chronic comorbidi-
ties of cancer and COPD, among others.
Another limitation of our study is our
use of unweighted analyses, which do not
account for potential intraclass correla-
tion within health plans. However, to ex-
plore potential effects of selection and
nonresponse, Hwang et al. (44), using a
weighted scheme to adjust for selection
and nonrespondent bias in Medicare HOS
data, found similar estimates of physical
and mental functions on SF-36 between
the weighted and unweighted analyses.
Nonetheless, the standard errors of esti-
mates were higher in the weighted analy-
ses. Because the dummy identifier of
health plans and the weighting schemes
were not available in the Cohort 1 Ana-
lytic Public Use File, we were not able to
perform weighted analysis. Despite these
limitations, our source of data has several
strengths, including its large sample and
its nationwide spread of older enrollees in
managed care plans across the U.S.
In conclusion, our study found that
health-related limitations of social func-
tioning are significantly predictive of ADL
disability and death over a period of 2
years among initially nondisabled older
diabetic Americans enrolled in Medicare
managed care plans. Multiple approaches
are needed to maintain independent liv-
ing and better survival in elderly diabetic
individuals. Older diabetic subjects who
report curtailing their social activities
might be at high risk of subsequent dis-
ability and, as such, should be targeted for
more rigorous evaluation and manage-
ment of any modifiable underlying emo-
tional or physical disorders. Improving
disability-free survival in older patients
with diabetes requires a better under-
standing of social functioning and social
support in this population. Given the fact
that the population aged 65 years is one
of the fastest growing segments in the
U.S., the current findings have important
implications for health care planning and
resource allocation to maintain indepen-
dence in older adults living with diabetes.
