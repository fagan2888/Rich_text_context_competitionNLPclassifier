OLD AGE IN FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS
The two films reviewed below, Ladies in Lavender
and Autumn Spring, both focus on the transformations
of characters in old age. In the former, two old sisters
live a quiet life in a cottage on the coast of Cornwall in
1936. One of them lost her fiance
Â´ in WWI. The other
has never experienced a great love in her life. Suddenly
their serene life is turned topsy-turvy when they rescue
a young Polish man who is washed up on shore below
their cottage. Bradley Fisher, the reviewer for this film,
analyzes the awakening of love in old age both as
a folly for one of the minor characters in the film and as
a profound event for one of the two sisters. He
proposes that when one of the sisters finally is able to
gain a perspective on her feelings of love and loss, she
reaches a state of elderhood--representing an attain-
ment of identity based upon self-awareness and self-
knowledge. She reaches a state whereby she can
redirect her passion for the young man. Now she
realizes and accepts her status as his mentor and his
advocate. At the same time, Fisher proposes that the
relationship between the two sisters has been strength-
ened by virtue of their shared bonds regarding the
experiences of love and loss. This film explores some of
the tragic elements of old age and examines the desire
to seek love and renewal even late in life.
The second film, Autumn Spring, appeared on Czech
television in 2001. The reviewer, Howard Schwartz,
analyzes the relationship between an old couple as an
example of the contrasting philosophies of activity and
disengagement. Whereas the husband delights in playful
creativity and harmless con games--in order to maintain
his zest for the possibilities of engagement--his wife has
embraced the philosophy that life has ended for both of
them. She prefers to make arrangements for the end of
life and spends most of her time organizing her funeral
and their burial arrangements. Their competing philos-
ophies collide repeatedly, and the results are often
hilarious. This film focuses on the comic elements of old
age and portrays the old characters affectionately and
respectfully. Thus, the struggle between activity and
disengagement must be resolved--one way or the
other--and done so with comic effect.
At the core of both films is the presence of veteran
actors and actresses who bring a lifetime of acting
experience to bear on their roles and transform their
characters from caricatures of old age to convincing
characters rich with idiosyncrasies and passions. In
Ladies and Lavender Judi Dench and Maggie Smith
create indelible portraits of two elderly sisters--one who
is stiff and stern and in charge of the household and the
other who is restless and intuitive and still trying to come
to grips with her aging. Watching these two actresses at
work--establishing their characters and playing off
their strengths against each other--is one of the simple
joys of watching this film. Likewise, the three veteran
actors in Autumn Spring create rich characters that
reveal both their shortcomings and their strengths. They
inhabit their roles, and they express the fullness and
variety of their characters with deft touches, including
gestures, the way they express dialogue, and their skills
at interacting within key scenes. Each of these five actors
in the two films brings 40 to 50 years of experience from
the theater and the cinema to their roles.
