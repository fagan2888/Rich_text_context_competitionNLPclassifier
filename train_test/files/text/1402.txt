Young Adults

Background: Genital chlamydial infection remains prevalent in
young adults. Differential access to health care and thus the opportu-
nity for testing, treatment, sexual partner services, and risk reduction
counseling may be among the factors contributing to variation in
chlamydial prevalence.
Goal: We investigated associations of health insurance coverage
and health care-seeking behaviors, both indicators of healthcare ac-
cess, to chlamydial infection in a nationally representative sample of
young adults.
Methods: Weighted logistic regression techniques were used to
examine associations between indicators of healthcare access and chla-
mydial infection as determined using Chlamydia trachomatis ligase
chain reaction among a subset of sexually active young adults ages 18
to 27 interviewed at wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (N  9347). Analyses were stratified by gender and
controlled for age and race/ethnicity.
Results: Having continuous health insurance coverage in the pre-
ceding 12 months was associated with a lower risk of chlamydial
infection in both men and women. Usual site of health care was also
associated with chlamydial infection. Men who reported emergency
rooms as their usual site of care had a higher risk of infection, whereas
women who used school clinics had a lower risk compared with those
seen in primary care settings. Having seen a provider in the preceding
12 months was associated with a lower risk of chlamydial infection for
men only. These associations remained even after adjusting for racial/
ethnic differences in health insurance coverage and health care-seek-
ing behaviors.
Conclusions: Independent of race/ethnicity, indicators of health-
care access are associated with chlamydial infection in young adults.
Furthermore, our analyses reveal differences in these associations by
gender. Improved healthcare access for young people could help re-
duce chlamydia-associated reproductive health morbidity potentially
through access to chlamydial screening, treatment, sex partner ser-
vices, and risk reduction counseling.
CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS INFECTION is the most com-
monly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the
United States,1 and prevalence is highest in young people.2 Most
genital chlamydial infections are asymptomatic,3 and identification
of infected individuals often relies on testing. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) each currently recommends annual
chlamydial screening for all sexually active women 25 years of age
and younger as well as for older, at-risk women (e.g., with new or
multiple sexual partners).4,5 The importance of annual chlamydial
screening for young women is further emphasized in that such
screening is an element in the Health Plan Employer Data and
Information Set (HEDIS) measures widely used for comparing
quality of healthcare provision.6 The benefits of chlamydial
screening have been demonstrated in settings in which screening
programs for women have reduced both the prevalence of infec-
tion7,8 and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rates.9,10
Despite screening recommendations and the availability of sen-
sitive urine-based chlamydial diagnostic tests, which can simplify
screening, C. trachomatis infections remain common. In a recent
population-based study of young adults living in the United States,
wave III of The National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), the overall prevalence of chlamydial infection
was more than 4%.11 There are likely many factors contributing to the
sustained high chlamydial prevalence, and one such potential contrib-

uting factor is insufficient chlamydial screening12 perhaps either be-
cause persons for whom screening is recommended are not seeing
providers or because providers are not testing them.
Among the many barriers to chlamydial screening in the U.S.
population may be access to health care, which is, in turn, influ-
enced by factors such as health insurance coverage and health
care-seeking behaviors (e.g., primary site of health care and fre-
quency of provider visits). In 2002, more than 43 million Ameri-
cans, disproportionately including young adults, were without
health insurance throughout the year, and millions more were
uninsured for shorter periods.13 In particular, uninsured young
people more often lack a usual source of health care, have unmet
health needs, and go without provider contact during the course of
a year.14 Moreover, health insurance coverage and health care-
seeking behaviors may vary by gender and race/ethnicity, and
select groups of individuals may have a disadvantage with regard
to access to healthcare services. Although healthcare access does
not assure that recommendations for chlamydial screening and
management will be followed, access to care may be a component
of efforts to accomplish these goals. Even among the insured,
chlamydia screening efforts may be hampered by individuals not
seeking provider care or receiving their health care at settings
where chlamydial testing is not performed routinely.
To date, there have been no population-based studies that ex-
amined issues of healthcare access and chlamydial infection. The
purpose of this study is to begin to investigate associations be-
tween health insurance status and health care-seeking behaviors on
the likelihood of chlamydial infection in a national sample of
young adults. For the first time, biomarker data are available as
part of data from a representative national sample providing na-
tional prevalence estimates of chlamydial infection for specific
racial and ethnic groups, separately by gender, as well as preva-
lence estimates by markers of healthcare access. We use multivar-
iate techniques to estimate the effects of health insurance and
health care-seeking behaviors on the odds of chlamydial infection
net of age and race/ethnicity. Because we propose that the effects
of healthcare access and race/ethnicity on the odds of infection
differ for men and women, all analyses are conducted separately
by gender.
Materials and Methods
Study Design and Study Population
The data used for this analysis are from wave III of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add
Health is a longitudinal survey of youth attending U.S. schools in
grades 7 through 12 during the 1994­1995 academic year. The
Add Health study design has been described elsewhere (http://
www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/design.html). Wave I of the
survey was collected in 1994­1995, wave II was collected in 1996,
and wave III was collected in 2001­2002 when the respondents
were ages 18 to 27 (i.e., young adults) and was comprised of
75.6% of the original eligible respondents interviewed in wave I.
For wave III, 15,170 wave I respondents and 27 wave II respon-
dents were located and reinterviewed (N  15,197).
For our study, we used a subset of wave III respondents.
Because of our interest in population-based estimates, we excluded
respondents for whom wave III sampling weights were unavailable
(n  875). We also excluded those: 1) without chlamydia test
results available (n  1777); 2) who denied ever having had
vaginal intercourse (n  1617); 3) who reported antibiotic use in
the prior 30 days (n  1493); and 4) with missing information on
health care-seeking behaviors (n  88). This resulted in a final
analytic sample of 9347 respondents (4473 men and 4874 women).
Interviews and Specimen Collection
Methods for interviews and specimen collection have been
previously described in detail (The Add Health Biomarker Team,
2003), and we briefly summarize relevant aspects here.11 After
obtaining consent, interviewers conducted 90-minute, private in-
terviews with each participant and entered responses directly into
computers. Participants also used computer-assisted self-interview
(CASI). After the interview and obtaining additional consent,
interviewers instructed participants on urine collection techniques
and a first-void urine sample was collected. Urine specimens were
shipped on ice packs to arrive at the testing laboratory within 96
hours of collection. C. trachomatis ligase chain reaction (LCR)
assays (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) were performed on
the urine specimens according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Of the 1777 respondents in wave III for whom valid chlamydial
results were unavailable, 647 had no LCR assay results recorded
and 1130 refused to provide urine specimens. We conducted
additional analyses, which revealed no systematic differences be-
tween those who had valid urine LCR results compared with those
who provided a urine specimen but for whom there were "no
results." There were, however, systematic differences between
those who provided a urine sample and those who refused (e.g.,
refusers were significantly more likely to be older, single and not
sexually active, female, college graduates, or to have missing
information on age at first intercourse; data not shown). More
comprehensive sensitivity analyses conducted by Miller and col-
leagues assessing the impact of nonresponse and test performance
found that the substantive conclusions were robust regardless of
the assumptions for nonresponders or test performance.11 We
therefore present estimates unadjusted for nonresponders.
Variable Description
The outcome is C. trachomatis infection coded as a binary
response (1  positive test result and 0  negative test result). The
primary independent variables are health insurance coverage and
health care-seeking behaviors. Respondents' health insurance cov-
erage was created based on the question, "Over the past 12 months,
how many months did you have health insurance?" Conceptually,
we are interested in examining whether continuity of health insur-
ance coverage is associated with chlamydial infection because
continued coverage could potentially provide greater opportunities
for screening. We imputed 75 cases of missing data ("refused,"
"don't know," or "not applicable" responses) using an ordinary
least-squares regression that included age, race/ethnicity, gender,
highest level of education completed, enrollment status, and union
status.15 Responses were then categorized into no health insurance
in the past year (0 months), insurance for 1 to 11 months, and
insurance for 12 continuous months with no health insurance being
the reference group. Because preliminary analyses found no dif-
ference by insurance product type, we combined all types into a
single insurance variable in subsequent analyses.
The two health care-seeking behaviors examined are usual site
of health care and time since last visit with a medical provider. For
usual site of health care, respondents were asked, "Where do you
usually go when you are sick or need health care?" Response
categories included: never get sick or need health care; hospital-
based clinic; hospital emergency room; community health center
or clinic; health maintenance organization (HMO); private doc-
tor's office; school or college clinic; military hospital or clinic;
clinic at work; or some other place. The categories of HMO,
private doctor's office, and clinic at work were combined because
we felt that they represented primary care (PC) settings. The
primary care setting category was the reference group. Time since
390 Sexually Transmitted Diseases  June 2006

last visit with a medical provider was based on information from
the question, "How long ago did you last consult a doctor or a
nurse?" We created a dummy variable measuring whether the
respondent had consulted a doctor or nurse in the last 12
months.
Sociodemographic characteristics serving as control variables in
our analyses include respondent's gender, age, and race/ethnicity.
Gender is a dichotomous variable, coded 1 for males and 0 for
females. Age is measured in years and is included as a continuous
variable ranging from 18 to 27 years. Respondents were asked
whether they were of Hispanic or Latino origin. They were then
asked their race and could select more than one option: white,
black or black, American Indian or Native American, and Asian or
Pacific Islander. Those who mentioned more than one race cate-
gory were asked, "Which one category best describes your racial
background?" Respondents who provided unusable information
were coded to the interviewer's perception of the respondent's
race. From these questions, a race/ethnicity composite measure
was created giving priority to any mention of Hispanic or Latino
origin. This resulted in the following race/ethnicity categories:
non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; Hispanic; non-Hispanic
Asian; and non-Hispanic Native American. Non-Hispanic whites
were the reference group.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses are conducted using wave III sampling weights and
account for the complex survey design of Add Health using
appropriate procedures (-svy- commands) available in Stata 8.216;
the weighting technique adjusts for sampling procedure (e.g.,
addressing oversampling of certain demographics) and for nonre-
sponse. All analyses are performed separately by gender. First, we
use current study population characteristics. Then, chlamydial
prevalence for each race/ethnic group is estimated separately by
gender. We also examine racial/ethnic differences in health insur-
ance status, usual site of care, and time since last provider visit.
Chi-squared tests, corrected for survey design, are used for the
biviariate analysis.17 Last, we investigate the associations between
each of these covariates and chlamydia test results separately by
gender, first unadjusted and then adjusted for age and race/ethnic-
ity using weighted logistic regression. A P value of 0.05 is
considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Population and Prevalence of Chlamydial Infection
Of the 9347 Add Health wave III participants analyzed, 48.6%
are women and the mean age is 21.9 years (standard deviation, 1.8
years). The majority are white (67.0%), followed by black
(17.3%), Hispanic (11.6%), Asian (3.2%), and Native American
(0.8%) (Table 1). Overall, 4.7% of young adults tested positive for
chlamydia with lower percentages observed for men (4.1%) com-
pared with women (5.4%) (P 0.05, Table 1). There are no
significant differences by age within this population of young
adults (data not shown).
Overall, chlamydial infection is highest among Native Ameri-
cans (13.3%) followed by blacks (12.9%), Hispanics (6.9%),
whites (2.3%), and Asians (1.8%) (P 0.001, Table 2). In young
men, chlamydial infection is highest among blacks (11.5%) fol-
lowed by Native Americans (10.3%), Hispanics (8.0%), whites
(1.6%), and Asians (0.9%) (P 0.001). In young women, chla-
mydial infection is highest among Native American women
(16.9%) followed by blacks (14.3%), Hispanics (5.6%), Asians
(3.1%), and whites (3.0%) (P 0.001).
Health Insurance Coverage and Chlamydial Infection
Overall, 19.7% of participants were without health insurance
during the 12 months preceding the interview and a greater
percentage of men were without insurance compared with
women (22.5% vs. 16.7%) (P 0.001, Table 3). Health insur-

ance coverage differs significantly by race/ethnicity for both
men and women (P 0.001 and P 0.01, respectively, Table 3).
Among men, Hispanics have the lowest and Asians have the
highest levels of coverage. Among women, whites and Asians
have higher levels of coverage than blacks, Hispanics, or Native
Americans.
Health insurance coverage is significantly associated with
chlamydial prevalence among men with the lowest prevalence
seen among men with continuous coverage (Table 4). Com-
pared with men with no health insurance, the risk of chlamydial
infection is significantly lower for men who were insured 1 to
11 months (P 0.05) or for 12 months (P 0.01). When we
control for age and race/ethnicity, only men with continuous
coverage have a significantly lower risk of infection than men
with no coverage (P 0.05). Compared with women with no
health insurance, women with continuous coverage have a
significantly lower risk of infection (P 0.01); however, this
difference is not statistically significant controlling for age and
race/ethnicity (P 0.1) (Table 4).
Site of Usual Health Care and Chlamydial Infection
Overall, the most common sites of usual health care are primary
care settings (47.1%) followed in descending frequency by hospi-
tal clinics, emergency rooms, community health centers, school
clinics, and all other sites (Table 5). Approximately 7.0% of
participants felt they did not need usual health care and denied
having a site of usual health care. The reported sites of usual health
care differ for men and women (P 0.001, Table 5). Compared
with men, women more often sought care from primary care
settings and less often in emergency rooms. Men also more often
felt they did not need usual health care than did women. The sites
of usual health care differ significantly by race/ethnicity for both
men and women (P 0.001 for both, Table 5). White and Asian
men more often sought services at primary care settings than
black, Hispanic, and Native American men; and black men
more often sought care at emergency rooms than all other
racial/ethnic groups (P 0.001). White and Hispanic women
more often sought care at primary care settings than black, Asian,
and Native American women; and black and Native American
women more often sought care at emergency rooms than the other
racial/ethnic groups (P 0.001).
Site of usual health care is associated with differences in chlamyd-
ial prevalence rates for men (Table 6). Among men, prevalence rates
are highest for those using emergency room and other settings and
lowest for those using community center clinics and primary care
settings (P 0.001). Compared with men reporting usual care from
primary care settings, the risk of chlamydial infection is higher for
men who seek care in emergency rooms (P 0.001) or at some other
place (P 0.05). When adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, men who
seek care in the emergency room still have a higher risk of infection
than those using primary care settings, but the odds ratio is reduced;

in contrast, the odds ratio for other settings showed little change
across the models. Site of usual care is also associated with variation
of chlamydial prevalence rates among women (Table 6); prevalence is
highest for women using emergency rooms and other settings and
lowest for those using school clinics. The unadjusted regression
results show that compared with women who sought services from
primary care settings, those who use emergency rooms have a higher
risk of infection and those who use school clinics have a lower risk of
infection (P 0.01, respectively). When adjusting for age and race/
ethnicity, only women who used school clinics have a significantly
lower risk of infection compared with women who used primary care
settings (P 0.01).

Time Since Last Provider Visit and Chlamydial Infection
Overall, 78.8% of study participants reported a healthcare visit
in the preceding 12 months with women being more likely to
report a visit than men (89.8% vs. 68.5%; P 0.001; Table 5).
Although the majority of all racial/ethnic groups among both men
and women reported a provider visit in the past 12 months, the
differences are significant for both genders (P 0.05 for men,
P 0.001 for women; Table 5). Hispanic and Asian men and
women are less likely to have reported a recent provider visit
compared with black, white, and Native American men and
women.
Time since last provider visit is associated with differences in
chlamydial infection in men but not women (Table 6). Men with
provider visits in the preceding 12 months have a significantly
lower risk of chlamydial infection than those who have not, even
when adjusting for age and race/ethnicity (P 0.05).
Discussion
Occurring in nearly one in 20 sexually active young adults in the
United States, genital chlamydial infection prevalence remains
unacceptably high.11 As an infection that is most often asymptom-
atic, C. trachomatis screening and treatment programs are critical
elements of current control efforts. Therefore, access to health care
(and thus screening opportunities) may well be among factors that
affect chlamydial prevalence. To our knowledge, our study is the
first to assess the relationship of indicators of healthcare access to
variation in chlamydial infection among a nationally representative
sample of sexually active young adults. We demonstrated that
insurance status, site of usual health care, and having seen a
provider in the last 12 months were each associated with variation
in chlamydial infection independent of gender, age, and race/
ethnicity, factors previously shown to be associated with variation
in health care-seeking behavior.14,18­22
One interpretation of our findings is that young adults who have
health insurance and seek usual care in primary care settings may
be more likely to receive chlamydial screening and treatment, and
consequently, the chlamydial infection is lower in this population.
Alternatively, these healthcare access traits may be markers for
populations who engage in overall healthier behaviors (including
sexual behaviors) and for membership in lower-risk sexual net-
works or perhaps who have certain socioeconomic traits such as a
higher income, which increases the likelihood they will have
health insurance and access to health providers to get screened
for chlamydia. The goal of our study was to examine some of
the factors associated with chlamydial infection with a focus on
healthcare access, a major potential barrier to chlamydial
screening. However, we acknowledge there are likely other
barriers to chlamydial screening (e.g., providers' willingness to
screen and/or exclusion of screening in standard care proce-
dures) and other factors influencing risk of chlamydial infection
(e.g., sexual behaviors) that are important and deserve further
study.
Women were insured more often than men; however, we were
somewhat surprised to find that more than 75% of young men and
women had health insurance for some amount of time during the
year preceding the survey. Over the past decade, health insurance
rates for young people may have increased as a result of the
enactment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in
1997 and Medicaid eligibility expansions, each providing mecha-
nisms for adolescents and young adults to obtain insurance.23 The
importance of health insurance expansion for the reproductive
health of young people is highlighted in our finding of a signifi-
cantly lower risk of chlamydial infection among insured individ-
uals with these associations persisting even after controlling for
race/ethnicity and age (more significant in men) (our study also
confirmed prior reports of lower insurance rates for most minori-
ties as compared with whites24). Furthermore, being insured con-
tinuously for 12 months was associated with even a lower risk of
chlamydial infection when compared with not having insurance or
being insured only part of the year. Many potential factors may
contribute to our finding of lower chlamydial infection among the
insured. Perhaps insured individuals are screened more often for
chlamydia, are more often exposed to risk-reduction interventions,
have greater access to care if they develop genitourinary symp-
toms, seek care from different healthcare provider types, or are
more likely to be prescribed chlamydia-effective antibiotics at
provider visits. Any or all or these explanations could contribute to
this finding and are appropriate for further study.
Having health insurance addresses one potential barrier to chla-
mydial screening, yet does not ensure young men and women will
see providers for screening. There are sparse data on health care-
seeking behaviors in young adults (18­27 years of age in wave
III); however, in adolescents, it has been reported that their overall
use of healthcare services is lower than for other age groups25 but
that insured adolescents more often seek health care than unin-
sured.14 Using data from over 14,000 adolescents included in the
1995 National Health Interview Survey, Newacheck and col-
leagues reported uninsured adolescents were twice as likely to go
without a physician visit during the course of a year.14 Most Add
Health wave III participants, who were initially enrolled as ado-
lescents in wave I and are now young adults, reported a provider
visit in the preceding 12 months, possibly reflecting in part that
most had health insurance. Racial/ethnic and gender disparities in
time since last healthcare visit were noted for both men and
women. Hispanics and Asians less often sought providers during
the year. Women were more likely than men to have visited
healthcare providers during the year, possibly related to visits for
reproductive health (e.g., contraception, Pap smears, and so on).
However, the risk of chlamydial infection was significantly lower
for men, but not women, who reported having had a provider visit
during the preceding year. This difference may reflect gender
differences in reasons for seeking care as well as practitioner
differences in screening based on gender, because national screen-
ing guidelines emphasize women. Women may tend to seek care
more often for health maintenance. In contrast, recent healthcare
provider visits for men may be more often problem-related (i.e.,
presenting with symptoms) and thus possibly be more likely to
lead to antimicrobial therapy.
Chlamydial infection also varied by self-reported usual site of
health care. Prevalence rates were higher among participants who
reported usually using emergency rooms and other acute care
settings than among those using more health maintenance-oriented
care in primary care settings. Preventive healthcare activities such
as chlamydial screening of asymptomatic persons is often beyond
the usual scope of care provided in acute care settings where care
is limited by time constraints and limited follow-up capacity.26­28
Men were more likely to report using emergency rooms for usual
health care than women, an observation perhaps also potentially
related to our finding that men also more often felt they did not
need usual health care (and presumably would only be seen for
acute problems such as genital symptoms). Interestingly, we also
demonstrated that women seeking care in school clinics had even
a lower risk of chlamydial infection than those seen in primary
care settings, perhaps as a result of the provision of sexual health
education and chlamydial screening or because of underlying
differences in risk-related behaviors among women using these
settings compared with those who use other settings.29,30

It is worth noting that health insurance status and health care-
seeking behaviors are interrelated, an issue we investigated
through a series of subanalyses (data available on request). Months
of health insurance coverage in young men and women was
positively associated with receipt of health care at primary care
settings and negatively correlated with health care obtained at
more acute care settings. This is a plausible finding given that
persons seen in primary care settings would be expected to have
more stable insurance coverage, access preventive services, in-
cluding chlamydial screening, and to receive treatment for genital
symptoms or a positive chlamydia test. An association between
months of insurance and receipt of care in primary care settings
has also been reported in adolescents. Newacheck and colleagues
reported that uninsured adolescents were five times as likely as the
insured to lack a usual source of care and, when receiving care,
less often did so in physicians' offices or HMOs and more often in
emergency rooms or urgent care settings.14 Another example of the
interrelationships among health care-seeking behaviors in our
study is that those who sought usual care at a primary care setting
rather than an acute care setting also more often saw a healthcare
provider in the last 12 months, which is also plausible because
those with a primary care provider would probably be more likely
to have routine yearly visits.
Our study has both strengths and limitations. The use of a
nationally representative sample is a major strength of our study.
This improves the generalizability and use of our results in con-
sidering the association between healthcare access and chlamydial
prevalence in "real-world" clinical settings independent of differ-
ences in race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and risk behaviors.
Furthermore, there are no other published data available, to our
knowledge, that have evaluated the influence of healthcare access
on chlamydial infection in a nationally representative sample;
hence, our study provides information that significantly contributes
to this important area of study and can serve as a basis for further
investigation. Finally, the sensitivity of the chlamydial diagnostic
assay used, chlamydial LCR, improves the accuracy of detecting
chlamydia.
It is important, however, to acknowledge study limitations not
already discussed. First, the population enrolled may have missed
several important subpopulations within the targeted age group.
Although representative of youth in grades 7 to 12 in 1994­1995,
young persons of these ages not enrolled in school may well have
had different (higher) chlamydial prevalence and patterns of health
care-seeking behaviors. Similarly, the construction of this multi-
purpose survey focused on heterosexual behaviors and thus makes
assessment of chlamydial prevalence among males who only had
sex with other males difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, a large
proportion of the nation's young people at the time the study was
initiated are represented here. Second, we did not have detailed
information on reasons for visits over the 12-month period of
interest or specific details on the healthcare interactions that oc-
curred (e.g., whether screening occurred and treatment was pre-
scribed) during each visit. Third, data were not available on how
frequently chlamydial screening was being routinely performed in
the different healthcare settings we studied. Fourth, because this
national study was a multipurpose study, not all healthcare access
measures are as comprehensive as would have been useful for
these analyses. For example, we excluded persons reporting anti-
biotic use in the prior 30 days, yet the type of antibiotic prescribed
and the treatment indication was unknown. The majority of anti-
biotics prescribed in outpatients are for respiratory tract infections,
and some of the antibiotics commonly prescribed (e.g., macrolides,
fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines) will have antichlamydial ac-
tivity and may treat a chlamydial infection that was never diag-
nosed. This is why we excluded recent antibiotic use (if we
included these treated subjects in our analysis, we may underesti-
mate the overall chlamydial prevalence because of the unantici-
pated treatment effect), yet it is possible persons with insurance
may more likely receive antibiotics and therefore have a lower
chlamydial prevalence, and our exclusion of these individuals
could bias our estimates of chlamydial prevalence. Finally, in our
analyses, we treated race/ethnicity as a confounding variable.
However, it seems reasonable that the effects of site of care, for
example, on chlamydia infection, might depend on race/ethnicity;
this is a question for future research. Although these limitations
may hinder our ability to state with confidence that there is a causal
link between healthcare access and chlamydial infection, we are
able to still infer from our study findings that there is a relationship
with the measures of healthcare access we studied and chlamydial
infection, and thus provide some of the first published data on how
measures of healthcare access may influence chlamydial infection.
In summary, our study demonstrates that health insurance and
health care-seeking behaviors, both measures of healthcare access,
are associated with chlamydial infection in a nationally represen-
tative sample of young adults. From our study findings, we pos-
tulate that efforts to further expand health insurance for young
people may help to reduce C. trachomatis-associated reproductive
health morbidity likely through improved provider access for
chlamydial screening, diagnosis, treatment, and sex partner ser-
vices. In addition, we believe at the same time that greater efforts
are needed in educating young adults and their providers about the
asymptomatic nature of chlamydia and the need for patients to see
their providers for a yearly routine visit where chlamydia screen-
ing can occur. Because chlamydial screening is still not occurring
in many settings routinely, more measures to encourage providers
to follow current recommendations for screening are also likely to
contribute to chlamydial control.
