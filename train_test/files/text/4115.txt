Abstract
Specular surfaces and refractive media are difficult to distinguish from each other because they
both generate distorted images of the surrounding lighting environment. Whereas convex
refractive objects invert the orientation of the horizon so the sky appears beneath the ground
plane, convex specular surfaces preserve the orientation of the horizon so the sky appears above
the ground. Here, we show that a refractive transparent object can be made to appear specular
and opaque simply by rotating the image by 180. This result suggests that the visual system relies
on information tied to the orientation of the horizon to distinguish between refractive and
specular objects.

Figure 1 compares a glass sphere (a) and a perfect mirror sphere (b) embedded in the same light
field. The most salient difference between the two materials is the orientation of the horizon,
which is right side upfor the mirror sphere,but upsidedown for the glass sphere.The orientation
of the horizon differs between the glass and mirror spheres because refraction and specular
reflection project light in different directions relative to the surface normal (Figure 1, lower).
Specularly reflected light has a similar direction to the outward facing surface normal, which
bisects the angle between the incident and specularly reflected rays. Refracted light, on the other
hand, is bent toward the inward facing surface normal when it enters glass and is then bent away
from the outward facing surface normal when returning to air.
We tested whether the orientation of the horizon functions as a cue for distinguishing
between refractive media and reflective surfaces. Observers were presented with upright
(Figure 2(a)) and 180 rotated (Figure 2(b)) images of a perturbed spherical geometry
rendered as refractive media using the physically based rendering software Maxwell

Render ($10 cm diameter with an index of refraction of 1.5111 and no roughness). The
simulation parameters were based on measured data for K7 Crown glass preconfigured in
the rendering software. Relief perturbation was generated by displacing vertices in the radial
direction by distances determined by a cloud noise texture. The camera was situated 30.5 cm
from the center of the object. We observe that the upright image (Figure 2(a)) generates a
compelling percept of transparency (as though it is constructed entirely from ice or glass),
whereas the inverted image (Figure 2(b)) is misperceived as more opaque and reflective.
We measured this image inversion effect by instructing eight nai¨ve observers to rate the
strength of perceived transparency or opacity when the image was presented in upright and
inverted orientations. The order of presentations was counterbalanced across observers.
Ratings were ordered metrically along a continuum from À1.0 through 0 to þ1.0. The
extremity of the rating from zero conformed to the observer's confidence in their rating of
one material classification over the other (zero meaning complete ambiguity).
Figure 2(c) shows mean ratings across all observers for the upright and inverted images.
The upright refractive object was judged as transparent and reflective with a mean rating of
À0.58 (SE ¼ 0.12), whereas the surface in the inverted image was judged as opaque and
reflective with a mean rating of þ0.50 (SE ¼ 0.05). Ratings were significantly different from
zero-level uncertainty for the object depicted in both the upright image (t7
¼ 4.99, p < .005)
and inverted image (t7
¼ 9.50, p < .0001). These results confirm an image inversion effect,

supporting the view that perceived transparency depends on the inferred orientation of the
horizon in the light field, assumed to be structured with prevailing illumination from above.
All observers indicated after their participation that the objects appeared globally convex.
This is important because concave specular surfaces will also generate an inverted image of
the horizon. For example, the convex specular sphere in Figure 1(b) can appear concave if its
image is viewed upside down. This observation suggests that perceived convexity and
perceived reflectance codepend on one another. Therefore, the visual system would need to
account for perceived convexity of the object to derive surface reflectance from the apparent
orientation of the horizon.
Another distinguishing feature of refractive objects is the distortion field--patterns of
magnification and minification in the refracted structure of light. For a fixed 3D shape and
light field, increasing refractive index increases the amplitude of the distortion field and
increases ratings of the perceived refractive index (Fleming, Ja
¨ kel, & Maloney, 2011; Ueda
et al., 2015; c.f., Schlu
¨ ter & Faul, 2014). However, increasing refractive index also reduces the
critical angle for total internal reflection. Total internal reflection generates significant
banding of image structure at regions of high curvature (Figure 2(a)), which may provide
additional information about the refractive properties of thick transparent objects.
The image-inversion effect we report here adds to previous literature by suggesting that the
global orientation of photometric variations in these distortions, and not just the local
structure of distortions per se, contributes to perceived transparency. This finding
compliments other studies that have identified illumination biases in the perception
of other surface properties, including 3D shape (e.g., Mamassian & Goutcher, 2001) and
pigmentation (e.g., Kim, Marlow & Anderson, 2014).

One potential caveat is that the image inversion cue requires a strongly directional,
anisotropic light field. Our results suggest it would be fruitful to further explore how the
structure of the light field influences observer judgments of perceived shape, opacity, and
refractive index.
