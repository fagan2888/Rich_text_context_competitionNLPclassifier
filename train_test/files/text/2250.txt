Serum Uric Acid and Achievement in High School
Henry J. Montoye and William M. Mikkelsen
The relationshipof serum uric acid concentrationand school achievement
was studied in 467 high school children in Tecumseh, Michigan. Serum
uric acid (SUA) was determined by the spectrophotometric method. No
statistically significant relationships were found between SUA and intelli-
gence quotientor average academic grades. There was also no significant
difference in SUA among the overachievers (higher grade point average
than predictedby IQ)as comparedto the underachievers.
Historians have made the interesting obser-
vation that men of genius and distinction are
frequently troubled with gout (1,2) which in
turn is associated with high concentrations of
uric acid in blood serum. This has led one au-
thor to speculate that serum uric acid (SUA)
might correlate with intellectual vigor because
uric acid shares with certain other purines the
capacity to stimulate the cerebral cortex (2). It
was of interest, therefore, to study the relation-
ship of SUA and achievement in high school.

study for more than 10 years (3).Almost 00% of the popu-
lation of approximately 10,000 persons have participated in
the investigation. Serum uric acid determinations have been
done as one of the laboratory procedures during each of the
three examinations of the participants in this study.
Approximately 83%of the eligible residents in `I'ecumseh
participated in the second series of examinations. The re-
spondents came to the clinic, usually in families, wherr a
blood sample was drawn. The subjects were not necessarily
in a postabsorptive state. Serum urir acid was determined
by the spectrophotometric method of Liddle rf a1 (4).
Most of the children who attend the Tecumseh, Michi-
gan High School are also participants in the health study.
The numbers at each age, for whom uric acid determina-
tions and other data were available, are shown in Table 1.
The data on their high school achievement was obtained
from the official school records during the 1965-1966
school year. Since the second series of laboratory exam-
inations was conducted during 1961-1965, the interval be-
tween drawing blood and recording the scholastic data var-
ied from 9 to 38 months. Moreover, SUA increases with age
at this time of life, particularly in boys (5). Therefore. a
negative correlation between data collection interval and
SUA was anticipated. An analysis of the data confirmed our
suspicions and the relationship was found to be linear.
Regression analysis within each age-sex group was there-
fore used to correct the SUA for months since clinic visit.
The average correction was small, only 0.24 mg%. The
means and standard deviations of the corrected SUA are
shown in Table I. The corrected SUA values were used in
all analyses.

3. Rank in graduatingclass (seniors only)
All of the analyses were done separately for boys and
girls and by class standing (Freshman, Sophomore, etc). In
all but one set of the analyses, the xztechnic was employed
to study the relationships. When this technic is used, it is
possible to add the separate xz analyses (one for each sex-
class standing group) and the degrees of freedom to study
the overall relationships. The one exception to using a x2
analysis was in the case of class standing at graduation for
seniors. The relationship of class standing and SUA was
studied by means of the rank order correlation
coefficient (Rho).
RESULTS
The relationship between SUA and IQ was
studied in freshman girls by recording the num-
ber of girls a) whose SUA and IQ values placed
them in the upper half of both distributions; b)
the number of girls who fell in the upper half of
the SUA and lower half of the IQ distributions;
c) the number in the lower half of the SUA and
upper half of the IQ distributions and finally d)
the number of girls in the lower half of both
SUA and IQ distributions. Under the hypothe-
sis that there is no relationship between SUA
and IQ, one should expect about one-fourth of
the subjects in each quadrant (the theoretical or
expected frequencies). These theoretical fre-
quencies were compared to the observed fre-
quencies. If the discrepancy is large, the x2 will
be large and evidence is available that the hy-
pothesis of no relationship between SUA and
IQ is not tenable. In the analysis for freshmen
girls, the x2 was only 0.65; hence, insufficient
evidence is available to reject the hypothesis.
Thus, one cannot conclude that SUA and IQ
are related. The same procedure was followed
with the other class standing groups, for boys
and girls. In no individual group or in the over-
all analysis was the x2 sufficiently large to sug-
gest a relationship between SUA and IQ.
Similar analyses were done for the relation-
ship between academic grade point average
(1965-1966 school year) and SUA. However,
such sex-class standing group was divided into
approximately three equal subgroups on the ba-
sic of academic grades. This provided a series of
2 x 3 x2analyses. Again, none of the x2analyses
were statistically significant. Thus, there was
no evidence that those children who received
high grades had significantly different SUA
than those whose grades were low.
Students in the 1966 graduating class were
ranked on the basis of their academic grades
over the 4 years in high school. These children

were also ranked on the basis of their SUA. The
rank order correlations for the 56 male seniors
was 0.17 and the 40 female seniors, 0.06, in-
dicating no significant relationship between
SUA and rank in class. Since there is evidence
that SUA is related to drive (6),it was thought
that perhaps SUA might be higher in over-
achievers in school. Therefore, the seniors were
ranked by IQ and academic grades (males and
females, separately) and the difference in these
two ranks calculated for each child. Thus, an
overachiever would be one whose rank in class
was considerably higher than his rank in IQ.
The differences in ranks were in turn ranked
with highest positive difference (grade rank-IQ
rank) at the top. These ranks were then com-
pared with rank in SUA. The coefficients were
close to zero, 0.03and -0.07, respectively.
As another way of studying the over-
achievers, the children who were in the lower
half of the IQdistribution in each class standing
group were studied separately. These children
with the lower IQs were tabulated as to
whether they were in the upper or lower SUA
distributions and the upper or lower grade
point distributions. This provided a 2 x 2 x2
table for each class standing group. The result-
ing insignificant x2 analyses indicated that the
SUA of overachievers was no different from
that of underachievers.
DISCUSSION
The lack of relationship between IQ and
SUA is not surprising. Although one investiga-
tor (7) reported a statistically significant corre-
lation between these two variables among 817
army recruits, the relationship was very weak (r
= 0.076). Kasl and collaborators (8,9) also
found a low correlation between IQ and SUA in
high school students (r = .lo). Dunn et af (10)
reported no correlation between SUA and col-
lege aptitude scores among 96 medical students.
Similarly, these investigators reported SUA to
be unrelated to grades (high school and medical
students) or the difference in grades and apti-
tude (medical students). Our results were much
the same. On the other hand Kasl and col-
leagues (8) reported a significant but low corre-
lation coefficient (r = .20) between SUA and
grade point average in high school students.
Furthermore, when IQ and grade point average
were compared, the overachievers (higher
grade point average than would be predicted by
IQ had significantly higher SUA than under-
achievers. These results are different from
ours. However, Kasl et a
f (11) reported vary-
ing results in different high schools and postu-
lated that the school setting and selection of
subjects may be factors of importance. Evi-
dence for a relationship of SUA to psycho-
social factors has been reviewed in other
reports (8,9, 11, 12).
It is possible, also, that the lag of from 9 to 38
months between time when blood samples were
taken and the time when school achievement
data were obtained may have vitiated the rela-
tionships among the variables. This does not
seem likely since SUA is fairly stable over a pe-
riod of 2 years, r = .65 to .80 (1l , 12). How-
ever, we have no measure of this effect in our
data.
