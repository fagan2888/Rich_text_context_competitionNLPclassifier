Abstract
Objectives: To assess the effect of thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) on pain management and
preservation of pulmonary function compared with intravenous, patient-controlled analgesia
(IVPCA) in patients with multiple rib fractures (MRFs).
Methods: Ninety patients with unilateral MRFs were included in this prospective study and
randomly assigned to the TPVB or IVPCA group. The visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, blood
gas analysis, and bedside spirometry were measured and recorded at different time points after
analgesia.
Results: TPVB and IVPCA provided good pain relief. VAS scores were significantly lower in the
TPVB group than in the IVPCA group at rest and during coughing (P < 0.05). Patients in the TPVB
group had a higher PaO2
and PaO2
/FiO2
and lower P(A­a)
O2
compared with the IVPCA group
(P < 0.05). Moreover, patients in the TPVB group showed higher FVC, FEV1/FVC, and PEFR, and
fewer complications than did the IVPCA group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: TPVB is superior to IVPCA in pain relief and preservation of pulmonary function in
patients with MRFs.

which may adversely affect coughing and
deep breathing. Pain relief is important for
preventing complications, including atelec-
tasis, chest infection, and respiratory fail-
ure.2 These complications, if severe, may be
more harmful than the injury itself, and can
be life-threatening.
Paravertebral block (PVB), through
injecting a local anaesthetic agent close to
where the spinal nerves exit the interverte-
bral foramina, can provide high-quality
ipsilateral, segmental, somatic, and sympa-
thetic nerve blockade. PVB is a successful
regional method for amelioration of pain in
patients undergoing esophagectomy,3 breast
surgery,4 thoracotomy,5 cardiac surgery,6
hepatectomy,7 inguinal herniorrhaphy,8 per-
cutaneous nephrolithotomy,9 and nephrec-
tomy.10 Thoracic paravertebral block
(TPVB) has also been used for pain relief
of MRFs.11­13 Differences in the efficacy and
safety between TPVB and traditional anal-
gesia for MRFs, including thoracic epidural
analgesia (TEA) and intravenous analgesia,
need to be considered. Mohta et al.14
showed that TPVB was as effective as TEA
for pain treatment in patients with unilateral
MRFs. However, comparison between
TPVB and intravenous analgesia in patients
with MRF has rarely been reported.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
effect of TPVB on pain management and
preservation of pulmonary function com-
pared with intravenous patient-controlled
analgesia (IVPCA) in patients with MRFs.
Materials and methods
Patients and procedures
The study was conducted at Ningbo 6th
Hospital (Ningbo, China) between January
2015 and August 2016. The protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of Ningbo
6th Hospital and written informed consent
was obtained from each patient. This pro-
spective, randomized study included 90 adult
patients of either sex, having three or more
unilateral fractured ribs. The exclusion cri-
teria were as follows: age <18 or >70 years;
severeheadinjuryorunconsciousness;patho-
logical obesity (body mass index !35); thor-
acic and abdominal visceral injuries; unstable
cardiac status; severe liver or kidney disease;
coagulopathy; spinal or pelvic fracture; infec-
tion at the puncture site; and allergy to local
anaesthetics. The patients' characteristics are
shown in Table 1.
On arrival to the anaesthetic room, intra-
venous access was established, and standard
monitors were applied, including electrocar-
diography, noninvasive blood pressure, and
pulse oximetry. All of the patients received
oxygen via a nasal cannula to maintain
SpO2
> 90% blood oxygen saturation and
none of them received mechanical ventila-
tion. By using the sealed envelope technique,
the patients were assigned randomly to the
TPVB or IVPCA group. In the TPVB
group, the patients were placed in the lateral
decubitus position. A 7.5-MHz linear ultra-
sound probe (LOGIQ a-200 E, GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, USA) was used to
identify the spinous process, transverse pro-
cess, pleura, superior costotransverse liga-
ment, and the paravertebral space at the
target vertebral level. After standard skin
disinfection, a 20-gauge, 8-cm puncture
needle (Pajunk GmbH Medizintechnologie,
Geisingen, Germany) was inserted into the

paravertebral space under ultrasound guid-
ance. This was performed using a lateral to
medial in-plane needle insertion technique
as previously described.15,16 After negative
aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid,
15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was slowly
injected. A 24-gauge, 30-cm catheter
(Pajunk GmbH Medizintechnologie,
Geisingen, Germany) was then inserted 3­
4 cm beyond the needle tip. After negative
aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid,
15 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected. The
solution in the TPVB pump contained
250 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine, and the con-
tinuous infusion rate was set at 5 mL/h. The
bolus dose was 5 mL and the lockout inter-
val was 15 minutes. In the IVPCA group,
sufentanil 2 mg/kg diluted in normal saline
was used as the IVPCA solution and the
volume was 100 mL. The continuous deliv-
ery dose was set at 2 mL/h. The bolus dose
was 2 mL with a 15-minute lockout time.
For each patient, oral acetaminophen
(500 mg) was provided every 12 hours.
Low-dose tramadol 1 mg/kg was adminis-
tered when the visual analogue scale (VAS)
score was greater than 4 as rescue analgesia.
Measurements and sample
size calculation
Trained nurses who were blinded to the
patient's treatment collected various data.
Pain at rest and on coughing was estimated
with the VAS pain score (0, no pain; 10,
worst imaginable pain). Blood gas analysis
was performed to measure arterial partial
pressure of oxygen (PaO2
), arterial partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2
), PaO2
/
Fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2
), and
Alveolar - arterial oxygen partial pressure
difference (P(A­a)
O2.
) These parameters were
recorded pre-analgesia (T0
), at 60 minutes
post-analgesia (T1
), and on post-analgesia
days 1 (T2
), 2 (T3
), and 3 (T4
). Bedside
spirometry (forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEV1)/FVC, and the peak expiratory flow
rate [PEFR]) was measured by using a
ventilometer (CHEST HI-701; YILIAN
Medicine, Shanghai, China) at T0
, T1
, and
T4
. All anaesthesia-related adverse events
were also recorded.
This study aimed to compare the efficacy
and safety of TPVB as a method of pain relief
following MRFs compared with IVPCA.
The primary outcome measurement was the
VAS score at rest. After a pilot study
(6 patients per group), a 23% reduction was
found in the TPVB group. The authors then
estimated that the required minimum sample
size would be 22 patients per group, with a
significance level of 0.05 and a power of 90%.
Finally, 90 patients were enrolled in this
study (45 patients per group).
Statistical analysis
SPSS15.0 software was used for statistical
analysis. Quantitative variables are
expressed as means Æ SD and were com-
pared using the t test. Categorical variables
are expressed as number (%) and were
compared using the chi-square test.
P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
A total of 90 patients were included in this
study. The patients' characteristics are
shown in Table 1. There were no significant
differences in age, sex, body weight, number
of fractured ribs, chest Abbreviated Injury
Score, and Injury Severity Score between the
two groups (P > 0.05).
There was a significant decrease in VAS
scores at rest and during coughing at all time
points after analgesia (T1
­T4
) compared with
baseline values (T0
) in the TPVB and IVPCA
groups (Table 2). The pain scores at rest at T1
and T2
were significantly lower in the TPVB
group thanintheIVPCA group. Additionally,
a significant difference was found in pain
scores were significantly lower during
Yeying et al. 2087
coughing at all time points in the TPVB group
compared with the IVPCA group.
Blood gas analysis showed that PaO2
and
PaO2
/FiO2
were significantly increased, and
P(A­a)
O2
was significantly decreased at all
time points (T1
­T4
) after TPVB compared
with baseline values (T0
) (Table 3). In the
IVPCA group, we observed increased PaO2
and PaO2
/FiO2
, and decreased P(A­a)
O2
only
at the time points of T2
, T3
, and T4
compared with baseline values.
Furthermore, patients in the TPVB group
had significantly higher PaO2
and PaO2
/
FiO2
(T2
­T4
), and lower P(A­a)
O2
(T1
­T4
)
compared with the IVPCA group (Table 3).
The bedside pulmonary function test
showed increased FVC, FEV1/FVC, and
PEFR after analgesia (T1
and T4
) in the
TPVB and IVPCA groups compared with
baseline values (T0
) (Table 4). Moreover,
patients in the TPVB group showed higher
FVC, FEV1/FVC, and PEFR compared
with the IVPCA group at T1
and T4
.
No serious anaesthesia-related complica-
tions or deaths occurred in either group. The
incidence of pulmonary complications was
significantly less in the TPVB group (n ¼ 3,
6.7%) than in the IVPCA group (n ¼ 9,
20%, P < 0.05). The incidence of nausea/
vomiting and somnolence was also higher in

Discussion
Effective analgesia, which permits deep
breathing and coughing, is one of the main-
stays of management of patients with
MRFs. The clinical analgesic methods for
MRFs include TEA, TPVB, and intravenous
analgesia. Analyses of the advantages and
disadvantages of these different analgesic
methods are helpful in clinical practice.
TPVB is technically less complex than
other methods, and there are few absolute
contraindications.17 Because there is no need
for use of opioids, urinary retention and
pruritis are not concerns with TPVB.17
However, rapid absorption of local anaes-
thetic enables toxicity, especially if more
than one catheter is place.17 Previous studies
have already shown the advantages of TPVB
compared with TEA in patients with MRFs.
PVB shows similar analgesic effects com-
pared with epidural anaesthesia with fewer
complications.14 Therefore, our study
focussed on analgesic efficacy, protection of
respiratory function, and adverse effects of
TPVB compared with IVPCA.
In our study, pain scores at rest (T1
and
T2
) and during coughing (T1
­T4
) were sig-
nificantly lower in the TPVB group than in
the IVPCA group. This finding indicated that
TPVB may provide a better analgesic effect
than IVPCA. These findings are consistent
with the results of previous studies as follows.
A previous study showed that paravertebral
block was associated with improved post-
operative pain relief compared with intra-
venous analgesia in patients undergoing
herniorrhaphy.18 TPVB is also superior to
IVPCA in pain management after thoracot-
omy.19 Additionally, TPVB is more effica-
cious for prolonging postoperative analgesia
and reducing morbidity in patients undergo-
ing elective unilateral breast surgery.20
Another interesting finding of our study is
that there was a significant difference in post-
analgesia pulmonary function between the
TPVB and IVPCA groups. We observed
higher FVC, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, PaO2
, and
PaO2
/FiO2
, and lower P(A­a)
O2
in the TPVB
group compared with the IVPCA group. The
incidence of pulmonary complications was
significantly higher with IVPCA compared
with TPVB. Bilgin et al.21 also observed a
significant reduction in FEV1 and FVC in
the systemic analgesia group compared with
the TPVB group 24 h and 48 h after thora-
cotomy. Two possible reasons could explain
the advantages of TPVB in pulmonary
function protection. First, in our study,
TPVB was superior to IVPCA for analgesia,
and resulted in lower pain scores, especially
during coughing. Effective analgesia in the
TPVB group is conducive to deep breathing
and coughing, thereby improving lung func-
tion. Second, sufentanil, a synthetic opioid,
was used in the IVPCA group. Respiratory
depression is one of the most feared side
effects of opioids.22 For patients with MRFs,
powerful opioids are depressants and sup-
press coughing, and may promote

respiratory complications even as they
reduce pain.17 Moreover, in the present
study, IVPCA was associated with a signifi-
cantly higher incidence of nausea and vomit-
ing, another common side effect of opioid
analgesics compared with TPVB.23 Taken
together, these results suggest that TPVB
may be a safer analgesic method for MRFs
than IVPCA.
There are some limitations of our study.
First, we only collected data at a few time
points to avoid disturbing the patients.
Second, some parameters, such as blood
pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate,
were not included in this study. Studies that
contain more parameters need to be
included in future studies.
In conclusion, our study shows that TPVB
is superior to IVPCA in pain relief and
preservation of pulmonary function for
patients with MRFs. Large-scale, multicen-
tre studies are required to confirm our results.
