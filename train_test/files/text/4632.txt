Clinical Report
Emergence delirium is
related to the invasiveness
of strabismus surgery in
preschool-age children
Jin Joo, Sunmi Lee and Yoonki Lee
Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the correlation between preoperative anxiety and emergence delirium
(ED), and to identify other factors that contribute to ED (such as invasiveness of surgery), in
preschool-age paediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery.
Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled Korean children (aged 2­5 years),
scheduled for strabismus surgery. After completing the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale,
general anaesthesia was induced. Postoperatively, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium
(PAED) scores (used as an index of the degree of ED) and a four-point delirium scale (ED
incidence), were collected and measured every 5 min. Patients were categorized according to the
degree of surgical invasiveness: group U-S, single-muscle correction in a unilateral eye; group U-M,
multiple-muscle correction in a unilateral eye; group B-S, single-muscle correction in bilateral eyes;
group B-M, multiple-muscle correction in bilateral eyes.
Results: A total of 90 paediatric patients participated in the study. Maximum PAED scores did not
correlate with the presence of preoperative anxiety. The maximum PAED score of group B-M was
significantly higher than scores observed in other groups.
Conclusions: Preoperative anxiety was not related to ED in preschool-age paediatric patients
undergoing strabismus surgery. The incidence and severity of ED was higher in patients who
underwent more complicated strabismus surgery, compared with those undergoing simpler
procedures.

Introduction
Emergence delirium (ED) is one of the
most common complications in children
after general anaesthesia; it is a disturbance
in a child's awareness of (and attention to)
his or her environment with disorientation
and perceptual alterations, including
hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive
motor behaviour, in the immediate post-
anaesthesia period.1­5 ED occurs within
30 min of recovery from anaesthesia and is
usually a self-limiting phenomenon.6,7
However, ED may cause injury in paedi-
atric patients, necessitating extra recovery
nursing, and is associated with decreased
satisfaction scores in parents.8 Although
various risk factors for ED have been
reported in a large number of published
studies,1­8 its aetiology and pathogenesis
remain unclear.
Young age, especially between 2­5 years
old, is a well-known risk factor for
ED;2,5,9­11 consequently, many studies on
ED have focused on that age range.2,3,12­14
Ophthalmological procedures, such as stra-
bismus surgery, are also associated with an
increased incidence of ED.2,4,5,9­11,14­18
Strabismus surgery, which is one of the
most commonly undertaken surgeries in
paediatric patients, may cause visual dis-
turbance in the recovery phase, which can
result in ED.5,17,18
A child's preoperative anxiety level is
another well-known risk factor for
ED;5,9,16,17,19,20 several studies have
reported that heightened preoperative anx-
iety is associated with heightened incidence
of ED.16,18­20 Additionally, ED was
reported to be associated with the level of
invasiveness of the procedure.21
However, in our experience of anaesthe-
sia in children receiving strabismus surgery,
preoperative anxiety does not appear to be
correlated with ED. Furthermore, children
who are less anxious preoperatively are
often observed showing more ED (and,
indeed, vice versa) during recovery
from general anaesthesia. Considering
that invasiveness may affect the occurrence
of ED, this would suggest that
binocularity and the number of muscles
involved in strabismus surgery might influ-
ence ED.
The present prospective observational
study was designed to investigate the correl-
ation between preoperative anxiety and ED.
The degree and incidence of ED were
assessed and calculated using the Pediatric
Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)
score (Table 1)10 and a four-point delirium
scale. On the ED scale, the scores were: 1,
calm; 2, not calm, but could be easily
calmed; 3, not easily calmed (moderately
agitated or restless); 4, combative, excited
or disoriented; scores of 1 and 2 were
considered nonproblematic behaviour, and
scores of 3 and 4 were considered delirium.2
This score was also used to calculate the
incidence of ED. The study involved pre-
school-age paediatric patients undergoing
strabismus surgery with a standardized
anaesthetic protocol using sevoflurane.
Secondary objectives of the study were to
identify other factors associated with ED,
such as age and sex, and to assess the
duration and invasiveness of the surgical
procedure.

Items 1, 2, and 3 are reverse-scored, as follows: 4, not at
all; 3, just a little; 2, quite a bit; 1, very much; 0, extremely.
Items 4 and 5 are scored as follows: 0, not at all; 1, just a
bit; 2, quite a bit; 3, very much; 4 extremely. Scores for
each item are summed to obtain the total PAED scale
score. Degree of emergence delirium increases directly
with total score.

Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective observational study
enrolled consecutive American Society of
Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2
South Korean children, aged 2­5 years,
scheduled for strabismus surgery in the
Department of Anaesthesiology and Pain
Medicine, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College
of Medicine, The Catholic University of
Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea, between
September 2010 and August 2011. All
patients were allowed to take solid food up
to 6 h before surgery and water up to 2 h
before surgery. Children with pre-existing
neurological disorders and those whose
parents refused to enrol them were excluded.
This study was approved by the Ethical
Committee of Seoul St Mary's Hospital,
Catholic University of Korea (ID: KIRB-
00353_26-003) and was registered at http://
www.cris.nih.go.kr (ID: KCT0000304).
Written informed consent was obtained
from the parents of each patient.
Study protocol
The patients visited a day surgery centre
(DSC) at Seoul St Mary's Hospital on the
operation day, with their parents. One desig-
nated DSC nurse who was trained in the use
of the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety
Scale(m-YPAS)22 administered the m-YPAS
upon the child's admission to the DSC. The
resulting m-YPAS scores were not provided
to other researchers or to medical personnel
until data analysis. Next, intravenous (i.v.)
access was established with a 22-gauge angio
catheter. Approximately 10 min prior to
entering the operating room, 0.1 mg/kg
midazolam i.v.23 was administered as a pre-
medication, and the patient was transferred
to the operating room, by medical personnel,
on becoming drowsy.
Electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood
pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry
were measured using standard techniques
continuously at 5-min intervals, starting
from the patient's arrival in the operating
room. General anaesthesia was induced with
2 mg/kg propofol i.v. bolus and 0.6 mg/kg
rocuronium i.v. bolus. After tracheal intub-
ation, anaesthesia was maintained with
2 vol% sevoflurane, 50% N2
O, and 50%
O2
, keeping the end-tidal CO2
between 30
and 35 mmHg. Strabismus surgeries were
performed by one surgeon . In patients who
had strabismus surgery in one eye, the
treated eye was protected with gauze and a
transparent eye shield after applying eye
ointment . In patients who had strabismus
surgery in both eyes, after eye ointment was
applied to both eyes, the eye that had a
greater reaction to exudate was protected
with gauze and a transparent eye shield; the
other eye was protected only with a trans-
parent eye shield.
At the end of surgery, sevoflurane was
discontinued; 75 mg/kg ondansetron i.v.,
0.9 mg/kg ketorolac i.v., 0.2 mg/kg pyrido-
stigmine i.v. and 0.08 mg/kg glycopyrrolate
i.v. were administered. After extubation,
each patient was brought to the postanaes-
thetic care unit (PACU).
On arrival in the PACU, one of the
parents or caregivers was called to be with
the child. A designated PACU nurse was
trained in the administration of the PAED
scale before beginning this study. This
trained nurse administered the PAED
scale10 at 5-min intervals, from arrival in
the PACU until discharge to the DSC, to
evaluate the degree of ED. The highest
PAED score, indicating most symptoms of
ED, was deemed the final score for each
patient. The nurse also graded clinically
observed delirium at 5-min intervals on the
four-point delirium scale also designed to
measure ED, described above.2
If the `face, legs, activity, crying, consol-
ability' scale score was >3 for >5 min , the
PACU nurse notified the anaesthesiologist
and then administered 1 mg/kg fentanyl i.v..
Joo et al. 1313
When patients showed signs of retching or
vomiting, 0.15 mg/kg metoclopramide i.v.
was administered as a rescue antiemetic.
0.1 mg/kg midazolam i.v. was administered
when scores on the four-point ED scale were
!3 for >5 min.
The following were also recorded: dur-
ation of surgery; duration of anaesthesia
(from induction to extubation); time to
awakening (time from arrival at the PACU
to the first response to a verbal command);
duration of stay in the PACU (from admis-
sion to the PACU following surgery to the
time of discharge to the DSC); fentanyl
administration; duration of DSC stay (from
the time of postoperative DSC admission to
the time of discharge from the DSC).
After study completion, the correlation
between m-YPAS and PAED scores was
examined. Patients were classified into a
high-anxiety group if their m-YPAS scores
were >40, and a low-anxiety group if their
scores were 40.24,25 The incidence of ED in
the high- and low-anxiety groups was
compared.
Patients and their data were also assigned
to the following groups according to the
invasiveness of the surgery: group U-S,
single-muscle correction in a unilateral eye;
group U-M, multiple-muscle correction in a
unilateral eye; group B-S, single-muscle
correction in bilateral eyes; and group
B-M, multiple-muscle correction in bilateral
eyes. Then, the maximum PAED score and
incidence of ED in each group were
compared.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 18.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. To estimate the sample size
needed, a two-sided test with a significance
level of a ¼ 0.05 and b ¼ 0.80 was used to
detect a correlation of 0.30 between
m-YPAS and PAED. Thus, the study
required a minimum of 84 patients. To
allow for the exclusion of some patients,
the study enrolled 90 paediatric patients.
Bivariate correlation analysis between
m-YPAS, age, sex, invasiveness of surgery,
duration of surgery and anaesthesia, and
maximum PAED score was performed using
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Then, stepwise multiple regression analysis
was conducted for those factors that were
shown to correlate with maximum PAED
score. All parametric data were compared
using one-way analysis of variance with
post hoc Bonferroni's correction for multiple
comparisons, and presented as mean Æ SD.
Nominal data were analysed with 2-test or
Fisher's exact test were expressed as num-
bers or percentages. A P-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. A recei-
ver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
method was employed to identify the appro-
priate cut-off maximum PAED score for the
presence of ED following strabismus sur-
gery in paediatric patients.
Results
This study enrolled 90 paediatric patients
(mean Æ SD age, 4.0 Æ 1.3 years; mean Æ SD
weight, 18.2 Æ 4.4 kg). The mean Æ SD
m-YPAS and mean Æ SD maximum PAED
scores were 46.1 Æ 20.9 and 14.7 Æ 3.2,
respectively. The m-YPAS and the max-
imum PAED score were not significantly
correlated (r ¼ À0.018; Figure 1). Of the 90
patients, 41 showed low anxiety and 49
showed high anxiety, based on their pre-
operative m-YPAS scores. Demographic
data were similar between the low- and
high-anxiety groups (Table 2). In total, 21
patients (51.2%) in the low-anxiety group
and 23 patients (46.9%) in the high-anxiety
group showed ED; this difference was not
statistically significant. The area under the
ROC curve for PAED scores >16 was 0.98,
with a true-positive rate (sensitivity) of 0.94
and a false-positive rate (1 ­ specificity) of
1314 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
0.03, thereby demonstrating that a threshold
score of 16 was optimal to discriminate
between the presence and absence of ED
(Figure 2).
Demographic and clinical characteristics
were similar in the four surgical groups
(Table 3). Group B-M had significantly
longer mean Æ SD surgery times (37.2 Æ
7.9 min) and mean Æ SD anaesthesia times
(52.5 Æ 8.7 min) compared with the other
three groups (P < 0.05 for all comparisons;
Figure 3). Group U-M and group B-S had
similar mean Æ SD surgery times (21.9 Æ 3.8
and 20.3 Æ 3.7 min, respectively) and similar
anaesthesia times (36 Æ 4.3 and 33.6 Æ
5.0 min, respectively); and both groups had
significantly longer surgery and anaesthesia
times compared with group U-S (11.0 Æ
2.2 min for surgery, 24.1 Æ 2.4 min for
anaesthesia, P < 0.05; Figure 3).
Characteristics of emergence delirium
and recovery are presented in Table 4. The
maximum PAED score for group B-M was
significantly higher than those for the other
groups (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
Group B-S showed a significantly higher
maximum PAED score than groups U-S and
U-M (P < 0.05 for both comparisons).
There was no significant difference in the
maximum PAED score between groups U-S
and U-M. The incidence of ED, according

to the maximum PAED score and the four-
point delirium scale score, in group B-M was
significantly higher than in groups U-S,
U-M, and B-S (P < 0.05 for all compari-
sons), but there was no significant difference
between groups U-S and U-M. Group B-S
showed a significantly higher incidence of
ED than groups U-S and U-M (P < 0.05 for
all comparisons). The incidence of rescue
fentanyl administration was similar among
the four groups; the association between
incidence of rescue fentanyl administration
and the presence of ED, within each group,
was not significant. Other recovery charac-
teristics, such as time taken to awaken, and
duration of stay in the PACU and DSC, did
not differ significantly among the four
groups.
Age, duration of surgery, duration of
anaesthesia and invasiveness of surgery were
significantly correlated with maximum
PAED score (P < 0.05 for all comparisons;
Table 5). However, multiple regression ana-
lysis showed that invasiveness of surgery
was the only factor that significantly influ-
enced maximum PAED score (multiple
regression coefficient ¼ 1.322, P < 0.001).
Discussion
Various studies have established the rela-
tionship between preoperative anxiety and
emergence delirium in paediatric
patients.16,18­20 Although many studies
have stated that preoperative anxiety is
associated with postoperative delirium, sev-
eral reports failed to find such a relationship.
For example, Faulk et al.26 reported that
preoperative anxiety as assessed by the
m-YPAS had no significant effect on the
PAED score in children aged between 1 and
12 years, undergoing outpatient dental pro-
cedures. Przybylo et al.9 also failed to dem-
onstrate a relationship between
preanaesthetic psychosocial factors and
postanaesthetic behavioural abnormalities
in children aged between 2 and 9 years,
scheduled for strabismus surgery. However,
the small size of the study population (27
patients) and the fact that the study included
school-age children limited the scope of their
conclusions. Unlike school-age children,
preschool children are psychologically
immature2 and are easily confused and
frightened by unexpected and unpredictable
experiences.11 Therefore, both studies may
have resulted in spurious relationships being
reported between preoperative anxiety and
ED, as opposed to other studies that
included predominantly school-age children
(who have a better understanding of the
situation that they are facing and are more
readily controllable). In contrast, the present
study focused only on preschool children,
aged 2­5 years, who are known to be a high-
risk group for ED.
The m-YPAS is reported to be an appro-
priate tool for assessing children's anxiety
during the preoperative period.22 The
PAED score allows for a more complex
evaluation of ED, based on actual psychi-
atric definitions of delirium, and has the
highest reliability and validity in examining
ED in paediatric patients.10 The maximum
PAED score was not correlated with
m-YPAS scores in this present study.

The correlation between the incidence of
preoperative anxiety and the incidence of
ED was also analysed in this present study,
but was found to be nonsignificant. The
present study employed two methods to
evaluate ED: PAED scores that equated to
the degree of ED; and a four-point delirium
scale that related to the presence, and
degree, of ED.2 The present results indicate
that preoperative anxiety and ED were not
correlated in preschool-age paediatric
patients receiving strabismus surgery.
What, therefore, explains the present
results, especially as they pertain to strabis-
mus surgery? First, it has been suggested
that visual disturbances may be involved in
ED to a greater extent than preoperative
anxiety.7 Secondly, the discomfort asso-
ciated with wearing the eye shield and
gauze patch following application of eye
ointment may have played an important
role. Finally, administration of midazolam
as a premedication may have also influenced
the discordance between preoperative anx-
iety and ED,26 despite the controversies
surrounding its use.3,27,28
Although the PAED scale is the most
comprehensive and well-validated scale used
to measure the degree of ED, the appropri-
ate cut-off value to denote the presence of
ED is still subject to conjecture. In the
original study describing the PAED scale,
the authors reported that a PAED score of
!10 was associated with the greatest degree
of sensitivity (0.64) and specificity (0.86) for
ED.10 Several other studies also performed
ROC curve analysis and reported identical
results to those of the original study.12,29
Conversely, in other research, a PAED score
of !16 was deemed to be an appropriate cut-
off value for ED because the PACU nurses
and evaluators did not believe that all
patients with a PAED score of !10 dis-
played problematic emergence behav-
iour.14,17 In the present study, a ROC
curve analysis was undertaken and demon-
strated that a PAED score of >16 was
associated with the greatest degree of sensi-
tivity (0.94) and specificity (0.98) for ED,
and is therefore the most appropriate cut-off
score. This higher cut-off score that we
observed (compared with other studies)
might be due to visual disturbances resulting
from the wearing of the eye patch, such that
eye contact (a scoring criterion in the PAED
scale), between the child and the PACU
nurse, might be difficult. In addition, differ-
ences in anaesthetic management, surgical
procedures and the age range of the study
groups might have influenced this result.
Patients who underwent strabismus sur-
gery in both eyes showed higher maximum
PAED scores than did those who received
strabismus surgery in one eye, which is con-
sistent with other research.12 Furthermore,
in the present study, the incidence of ED was
even increased in those patients receiving
bilateral surgery. In bilateral strabismus
surgery, patients who received multiple-
muscle corrections showed higher maximum
PAED scores, and incidence of ED, than did
those who received single-muscle correction.
Despite the fact that the duration of surgery
and anaesthesia were significantly different
between groups, it appears unlikely that this
would influence ED, considering that the
invasiveness of surgery itself was the only
factor affecting the occurrence of ED (as
demonstrated by the stepwise multiple
regression analysis). Moreover, this group
difference in ED implies that covering the
eyes in different ways had a minimal impact.
Another study found that the level of
invasiveness of dental surgery was related
to ED.20 Therefore, it seems that binocular-
ity, in combination with the number
of muscles involved in surgery,
increases the invasiveness of surgery, result-
ing in an increased incidence and severity
of ED.
Pain is considered to be one of the
confounding factors in the majority of
studies on ED, but it is difficult to fully dis-
criminate pain-related behavioural agitation
Joo et al. 1319
from ED in preschool-age children.8 In an
attempt to eliminate postoperative pain,
0.9 mg ketorolac i.v. was administered to
each patient after surgery, because ketorolac
given at 0.5­0.9 mg/kg has been shown to be
effective in preventing postoperative pain
following strabismus surgery.30,31 However,
in this present study the paediatric patients
who were obviously in pain did not exhibit
ED, although it was difficult to exclude the
presence of pain in patients with ED. In our
study, postoperative pain was managed
using fentanyl and there were no significant
differences in fentanyl administration
between the four groups, or according to
the presence of ED within each group.
Therefore, postoperative pain was unlikely
to have influenced the PAED scores, but one
cannot exclude pain as a possible
confounder.
This present study also administered
midazolam to every patient, because parents
were not permitted to enter the operating
room, in contrast to previous studies.19,20
Premedication with midazolam has contro-
versial effects on ED.3,27,28 The preoperative
anxiety of patients was assessed prior to
midazolam premedication, which might
have affected the relationship between pre-
operative anxiety and ED. However, the fact
that midazolam was universally adminis-
tered, and the large size of the study popu-
lation, is likely to have reduced the
likelihood of this being the case.
There were two main limitations in this
present study. First, the PAED scores, and
scores pertaining to the incidence and degree
of ED, were measured by a single individual
working in the PACU. As such, the possi-
bility exists that subjective judgements may
have acted as a bias. Secondly, patients were
not distributed equally among the four
surgical groups; because the primary pur-
pose was to investigate the correlation
between preoperative anxiety and ED,
patients were not enrolled according to the
type of surgery to which they were subjected.
In conclusion, preoperative anxiety was
not related to ED in preschool-age paediat-
ric patients undergoing strabismus surgery.
A higher incidence and degree of ED
occurred in patients receiving bilateral
strabismus surgery. In turn, a higher
incidence and degree of ED occurred in
bilateral strabismus surgery patients receiv-
ing multiple-muscle corrections, compared
with those who received a single-muscle
correction. Therefore, concerted efforts
toward prevention and management of ED
should be made for preschool-age paediatric
patients who are subjected to more complex
types of strabismus surgery.
