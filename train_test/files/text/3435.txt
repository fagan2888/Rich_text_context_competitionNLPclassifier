Abstract
Objective: The efficacy and side-effects of nefopam were prospectively compared with those of
fentanyl for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) following cardiac surgery.
Methods: Patients scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery were randomly assigned between three
PCA groups (nefopam, fentanyl or nefopam þ fentanyl). Pain was assessed at rest and during
movement at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after surgery using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Total infused
PCA volume, number of rescue drug injections, duration of intubation and length of stay in the
intensive care unit were recorded. The incidence of adverse effects was noted at 48 h
postoperatively.
Results: There were no significant between-group differences in VAS score, total PCA infusion
volume or number of rescue injections (n ¼ 92 per group). Nausea was significantly more common
in the fentanyl group compared with both other groups.
Conclusions: PCA with nefopam alone provides suitable postoperative analgesia after cardiac
surgery.

Introduction
Nefopam has been used to treat mild-to-
moderate postoperative pain since the mid
1970 s.1 Although its mechanism of action is
not completely understood, it is a centrally
acting, nonopioid analgesic that inhibits
reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and
dopamine.2
Open cardiac surgery causes severe pain
that can affect a patient's vital signs and
prognosis. Postoperative analgesia is
required to achieve patient comfort, stable
haemodynamics and postoperative rehabili-
tation.3 Analgesia with opioids alone can
cause side-effects such as respiratory depres-
sion, sedation, urinary retention and
nausea.4 Since opioids have limited anal-
gesic potency, it has been suggested that
drug combinations might improve analgesia
and limit the occurrence and severity of side-
effects.5 Studies have consistently demon-
strated a 30­40% decrease in postoperative
opioid consumption when nefopam is used
following abdominal or orthopaedic sur-
gery.6,7 Unlike nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs, nefopam has no effect on platelet
function,8 and (in contrast to opioids) does
not increase the risk of respiratory depres-
sion.9 In addition, nefopam has been shown
to result in decreased morphine consump-
tion when used as a coanalgesic following
abdominal surgery.10
The efficacy and safety of nefopam have
not been proven in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery. In addition, to the best of
our knowledge there are no studies report-
ing on the use of nefopam as the sole
analgesic after cardiac surgery. The aim of
this prospective, randomized, double-blind
study, therefore, was to investigate the
efficacy and side-effects of nefopam both
as a sole analgesic and as an adjuvant
analgesic in support of fentanyl for
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after
cardiac surgery.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled patients aged !20 years
with ASA physical status I­III,11 scheduled
to undergo cardiac surgery in the
Department of Anaesthesia and Pain
Medicine, Asan Medical Centre, Seoul,
Republic of Korea, between May 2011 and
January 2012. Exclusion criteria were: emer-
gency surgery; failure to give informed con-
sent; reduced left ventricular function
(ejection fraction <40%); history of allergy
to study drugs; use of monoamine oxidase
inhibitors; active seizure or history of seiz-
ure; glaucoma; high risk of urinary retention
(i.e., urethral or prostate disease); severe
renal or hepatic disease; critical pulmonary
disease or history of respiratory disease;
tachyarrhythmia or surgery for arrhythmia.
Patients were assigned to one of three PCA
groups using a randomization plan gener-
ator (available at http://
www.Randomization.com/): nefopam only;
fentanyl only; nefopam þ fentanyl
The Asan Medical Centre Institutional
Review Board, Seoul, Republic of Korea
approved the study. Ad all patients provided
written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Anaesthesia
In all patients, anaesthesia was induced
using 0.2 mg/kg etomidate, 0.6 mg/kg rocur-
onium and 20.0 ng/ml effective site concen-
tration remifentanil via target-controlled
infusion (Minto pharmacokinetic model12).
Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol
and remifentanil using the OrchestraÕ Base
Primea target-controlled infusion system
(Fresinius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany).
During surgery, volume-controlled ventila-
tion was performed and systemic arterial
pressure, central venous pressure and car-
diac output were monitored.

PCA
Based on the findings of others,13 the present
study used a basal fentanyl PCA infusion
rate of 20 mg/h, with a bolus demand dose of
10 mg/15 min and maximal hourly infusion
dose of 60 mg. The analgesic effect of 20 mg
nefopam has been shown to equal that of
6­12 mg morphine at a continuous basal
PCA dose of 2 mg/h.14 Therefore our study
used a basal nefopam PCA infusion dose of
4 mg/h, with a bolus demand dose of 2 mg/
15 min and maximal hourly dose of 12 mg.
The PCA was initiated postoperatively in
a double-blind manner by an anaesthetist.
The total drug volume was 150 ml/patient.
Patients in the nefopam group received
300 mg nefopam (2 mg/ml, infused continu-
ously at 4 mg/h) and 0.6 mg ramosetron (to
prevent nausea). Patients in the fentanyl
group received 1500 mg fentanyl (10 mg/ml,
infused continuously at 20 mg/h) with 0.6 mg
ramosetron. Patients in the nefopamþfen-
tanyl group received 140 mg nefopam
(0.93 mg/ml, infused continuously at
1.86 mg/h) with 700 mg fentanyl (4.7 mg/ml,
infused continuously at 9.4 mg/h) and 0.6 mg
ramosetron. Drugs were infused at 2 ml/h
using an AutoMed3200Õ (Ace Medical,
Seoul, Republic of Korea), with a patient-
controlled bolus injection volume of 1 ml.
The lock out time was set to 15 min to
protect against overdose. The maximal infu-
sion volume was 6 ml per h.
Pain was assessed using a visual analogue
scale (VAS) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after
surgery, both at rest (VASR
) and during
movement (VASM
). Tachycardia, sweating,
sedation, respiratory depression, itching,
nausea and vomiting were noted during the
first 48 h postoperatively. The total PCA
volume and number of rescue drug injec-
tions were recorded at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h
postoperatively. Duration of intubation and
length of stay in the intensive care unit
(ICU) were noted.
Sample size
Since the aim of the study was to test the
noninferiority of nefopam to fentanyl, VAS
at 24 h postoperatively was chosen as the
primary endpoint. The required number of
subjects per group was calculated from the
expression:
n ¼
2 Â Z
þ Z

where 1 was 2.2 (mean VAS of fentanyl
group in a pilot study), 2 was 2.9, (mean
VAS of nefopam group in a pilot study), the
noninferiority margin () was 1.5 (the largest
change from the reference value considered
to be trivial),  was 0.05,  was fixed at a 0.2
and  was 1.66 (the pooled variance). Based
on this calculation and assuming a 10%
dropout rate, the study required 100 patients
per group. Criteria for exclusion from final
analysis were: postoperative duration of
intubation !48 h; repeat surgery within
72 h; reintubation in ICU; and malfunction-
ing PCA device.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD or n (%).
Demographic data were compared using
Kruskal­Wallis test for continuous vari-
ables and 2-test for categorical variables.
Between-group comparisons of side-effects
were performed using 2-test or Fisher's
exact test, and multiple comparisons were
performed using 2-test or Fisher's exact test
with Bonferroni correction. Between-group
comparisons of extubation time and dur-
ation of ICU stay were made using Kruskal­
Wallis test. Total PCA volume and number
of rescue drug injections at 12, 24, 36 and
48 h were compared using repeated meas-
ures analysis of variance followed by post
hoc test to assess significance between two
groups. A linear mixed model was used to

compare simultaneous VAS values, to
account for correlations between repeated
observations. The noninferiority of nefopam
to fentanyl was analysed using 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) for the difference in
VAS (2À1, as above). Noninferiority was
confirmed when the upper 95% CI was less
than the noninferiority margin ( ¼ 1.5). All
statistical analyses were performed with
SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The study enrolled 300 patients, 276 of
whom completed the trial (119 male and 86
female; mean age 59.80 Æ 11.64 years; age
range 20­83 years). Reasons for noncomple-
tion were: postoperative duration of intub-
ation !48 h (n ¼ 11); repeat surgery within
72 h (n ¼ 5); reintubation in ICU (n ¼ 4);
malfunctioning PCA device (n ¼ 4). There
were no significant between-group differ-
ences in demographic or clinical character-
istics (Table 1).
The analgesic effect of nefopam was not
significantly inferior to that of fentanyl at
24 h after surgery, since the upper limit of
the 95% CI was <1.5 (the noninferiority
margin) both at rest (VASR
) and during
movement (VASM
) (Table 2). There were no
significant between-group differences in
postoperative VASR
and VASM
scores at
12, 24, 36, 48 or 72 h (Table 3), with the
exception of VASM
at 48 h (fentanyl vs
nefopam, P ¼ 0.014; fentanyl vs nefopam þ
fentanyl, P ¼ 0.024).
Data regarding side-effects are shown in
Table 4. The most common side-effects were
sweating, nausea and sedation. Nausea was
significantly more common in the fentanyl
group than the two other groups (P < 0.05).
There were no other significant between-
group differences in the incidence of any
side-effect.
There were no significant between-group
differences in the duration of intubation or
length of stay in the ICU (data not shown).
Data regarding the cumulative total PCA
volume and number of rescue drug injec-
tions are shown in Table 5. There were no

Discussion
The findings of the present study suggest that
nefopam is as effective as fentanyl for post-
operative pain relief after cardiac surgery.
Acute pain is inevitable after cardiac surgery
because of the damage to many pain-sensi-
tive structures due to tissue destruction,
intercostal nerve trauma, scar formation,
rib fracture, stainless-steel wire sutures and
costochondral separation.15À18 The result-
ing inflammatory response triggers the
release of numerous chemical mediators in
the periphery, lowering the nociceptor
threshold and making these receptors
more responsive to painful stimuli.19

Nefopam is a centrally acting nonopioid
analgesic that acts by modulating the
effects of these chemical mediators.
Its antinociceptive action results from inhi-
bition of serotonin, norepinephrine
and dopamine reuptake,2,20 and its antihy-
peralgesic action is due to reduced
glutaminergic transmission via N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptors.21 Administration of
nefopam during the perioperative period
has also been shown to reduce acute
hyperalgesia.22
The incidence of tachycardia and sweat-
ing was similar in all three groups in the

present study. This is in contrast with others
who reported that sweating was more
common in patients given nefopam than
propacetemol or morphine.7 All patients in
the present study were admitted to the ICU
following surgery and some were infused
with inotropic agents or vasopressors,
according to need. As these sympatho-
mimetic drugs can mask the effects of
nefopam,23 the vital signs, respiratory
effort and hepatorenal functions of every
patient in the present study were closely
observed while they were in the ICU. It was
therefore not relevant that the sympatho-
mimetic action of nefopam renders it contra-
indicated for patients with limited coronary
reserves3 since it was possible to detect any
early signs of unstable haemodynamics,
such as tachycardia and sweating.
The nonopioid nature of nefopam sug-
gests that it would result in fewer side-effects
(such as sedation or respiratory depression)
compared with opioids. The frequencies of
sedation and respiratory depression were
similar in all groups in the present study,
however. This may be explained by the
cumulative effect of the opioids used
during general anaesthesia; in addition, the
surgical procedure itself may have contrib-
uted to these side-effects. A low incidence of
sedation due to nefopam was also reported
in other studies.9,24
Nefopam was associated with a lower
incidence of nausea than fentanyl, in the
present study. It has been reported that 10­
30% of patients given a low dose of nefopam
experience nausea, usually after its first
administration.25 Nefopam may affect the
incidence of nausea by modulating chemical
mediators such as serotonin.
The present data indicate that nefopam
has a favourable safety profile in relation to
many systemic organs of patients who
undergo cardiac surgery. It did not cause
haemorrhagic complications at the usual
dose.8 Life-threatening effects have been
reported in relation to nefopam overdose,
however, including rare fatal overdoses
characterized by convulsions and arrhyth-
mia.26,27 An accidental overdose was
reported in a 77-year-old man who devel-
oped acute neurological impairment and
renal failure.28 Overdose was unlikely in
the present study, however, since a low dose
was used and all patients were closely
observed in the ICU after surgery.
The present study has some limitations. A
dose of 20 mg nefopam has been shown to be
equipotent to 6­12 mg morphine,24 but the
fentanyl equivalent is not known. The study
therefore employed the usual analgesic dose
of nefopam. Since the focus of the study was
on pain control rather than the physical
status of the patients, we used the same drug
dose for each patient regardless of their
weight. ICU care with mechanical ventila-
tion and sedation or inotropic and vaso-
active agents could mask the effect of
nefopam. In addition, we did not study the
long-term effects of nefopam (e.g. duration
of hospital stay) or its cost effectiveness. A
long term multicentre study is needed.
In conclusion, the present study indicates
that nefopam is effective for patients who
have undergone cardiac surgery, and PCA
with nefopam alone provides suitable post-
operative analgesia after cardiac surgery.
