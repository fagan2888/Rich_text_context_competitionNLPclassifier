Flavored Tobacco Product Use Among US Youth
Aged 12-17 Years, 2013-2014
Most tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood.1
Recent declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking among
youth have coincided with increased use of e-cigarettes and
hookahs.2 Although flavors
other than menthol are pro-
hibited in cigarettes in the
United States,3 flavored non-
cigarettetobaccoproductsare
widely available and may appeal to youth. We examined fla-
vored tobacco use among a nationally representative sample
of US youth.
Methods | The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health
(PATH) Study is a household-based, nationally representa-
tive, longitudinal cohort study of 45 971 adults and
youth (12-17 years) in the United States. We analyzed youth
data from wave 1, collected September 2013 through
December 2014 (the survey is available in the eAppendix
in the Supplement). Among youth within participating
households (weighted household screener rate, 54%), 78.4%
participated in an audio computer-assisted interview.
Nonresponse analysis showed few differences with re-
ferent national surveys.4 Survey weights were adjusted for
nonresponse.
Parents and emancipated youth provided written in-
formed consent, whereas youth assented to participate. Fur-
ther details regarding the study methods are available.4 The
study was conducted by Westat and approved by the Westat
institutional review board.
Youth responded to questions about ever and past
30-day use of tobacco products including cigarettes,
e-cigarettes, hookahs, cigars (traditional cigars, cigarillos, fil-
tered cigars), pipe tobacco, all types of smokeless tobacco,
dissolvable tobacco, bidis, and kreteks. For each product ever
used, youth endorsed whether the first product they used
was flavored (eg, "Was the first e-cigarette you used flavored
to taste like menthol, mint, clove, spice, candy, fruit, choco-
late, alcohol [such as wine or cognac], or other sweets?").
Users of noncigarette products reported any past 30-day use
of a flavored product. Past 30-day noncigarette tobacco users
also reported reasons for product use, including "(It) comes
in flavors I like," for each product. Past 30-day cigarette
smokers reported smoking cigarettes flavored to taste like
menthol or mint.
We used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) survey pro-
cedures to account for weighting and calculated proportions
with 95% confidence intervals for all measures. Estimates
from denominators of fewer than 50 users are suppressed;
estimates with relative standard errors greater than 30%
are flagged.
Results | Of the 13 651 youth enrolled and included in this
analysis, 51.3% were male, 54.5% non-Hispanic white, 13.7%
non-Hispanic black, and 22.5% Hispanic. Mean respondent
age was 14.5 (SD, 0.02) years. Table 1 summarizes ever and
past 30-day use of flavored tobacco products. The majority of
youth ever-users reported that the first product they had
used was flavored, including 88.7% of ever hookah users,
81.0% of ever e-cigarette users, 65.4% of ever users of any
cigar type, and 50.1% of ever cigarette smokers. For past
30-day youth tobacco use, the overall proportion of flavored
product use was 79.8% (95% CI, 77.3%-82.3%) among users
of any product and 89.0% among hookah users, 85.3%
among e-cigarette users, 71.7% among users of any cigar
type, and 59.5% among cigarette smokers.
Table 2 presents leading reasons for use among past
30-day noncigarette tobacco users. Youth consistently
reported product flavoring as a reason for use across all
product types, including e-cigarettes (81.5%), hookahs
(78.9%), cigars (73.8%), smokeless tobacco (69.3%), and
snus pouches (67.2%).
Discussion | Among a survey of youth aged 12 to 17 years, the
majority who self-reported ever experimenting with tobacco
started with a flavored product, and most current youth
tobacco users reported use of flavored products. This study
extends a recent national report5 on youth use of flavored
tobacco products by examining first use of flavored product
among ever users by products and flavorings as a reason for

noncigarette tobacco use. Consistent with national school-
based estimates,5 this study confirms widespread appeal of
flavored products among youth tobacco users. In addition to
continued proven tobacco control and prevention strategies,
efforts to decrease use of flavored tobacco products among
youth should be considered.1
Study limitations include potential difficulty with recall
because youth often experiment with many products. This
cross-sectional analysis does not allow direct estimation of
flavoring's role in initiation of tobacco use among youth. In
addition, there are mode differences in household- vs school-
based youth tobacco surveys.6 Data from future PATH Study
waves can provide information on tobacco use trajectories
following experimentation with flavored compared with
nonflavored products.

Estimates of ever and current use of bidis, kreteks, and dissolvable tobacco
products are not presented owing to small sample sizes of product users.
g Respondents who indicated ever having used a cigar were asked about use of
traditional cigars, cigarillos, and filtered cigars separately. Respondents
indicating use of 2 or more types of cigars (traditional, cigarillo, filtered cigars)
were asked about the flavor status of each type of cigar separately. Any
respondent who reported ever using 2 or more types of cigars had their
responses aggregated, so that if any of the first traditional, cigarillo, or filtered
cigars they used were flavored, they were included in the estimate of ever
cigar users reporting that their first cigar was flavored. Likewise, respondents
who reported using 2 or more types of cigars in the past 30 days and reported
past 30-day flavored use of any cigar were included in the estimate of flavored
cigar use among past 30-day cigar users.
h Past 30-day use estimates for pipes are flagged because of unstable estimates
(relative standard error >30%); proportion of flavored product use among
past 30-day pipe users are suppressed because of small denominators (<50).

COMMENT & RESPONSE
Use of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators
Among Medicare Patients
To the Editor Dr Pokorney and colleagues1 described low (8.1%)
use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in older
patients with myocardial infarction (MI) who met criteria for
implantation. They inferred that many older patients with MI

factors contribute to ICD underuse.
The authors' perspectives contrast with those of
Santangeli et al,2 who completed a meta-analysis of ran-
domized trials of ICDs for the primary prevention of sudden
cardiac death. That report showed ICD benefits declined
with age and were no longer statistically significant after
age 65 years. Although the mechanisms for the decreasing

a Past 30-day noncigarette tobacco users were asked to indicate (yes/no)
whether particular reasons applied to their use of each specific product. A set
of 14 items were asked of e-cigarette, smokeless tobacco, snus pouch, and
dissolvable tobacco users; 10 were asked of cigar and hookah smokers; and a
set of 9 were asked of pipe smokers and users of bidis and kreteks. Items can
be accessed on the PATH Youth Baseline Questionnaire available in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
b Individuals whose response was missing or responded "don't know" to
whether they used products in the past 30 days were excluded from the
denominator, including n = 30 for e-cigarettes, n = 9 for cigars, n = 7 for
hookahs, n = 13 for smokeless tobacco, and n = 2 for snus pouches. Estimates
for pipe, dissolvable tobacco, bidi, and kretek users are not presented owing
to small denominators of past 30-day users (n <50). Cited sample sizes reflect
unweighted Ns.
c Past 30-day users whose response was missing or who responded
"don't know" to any item regarding reasons for use were excluded from the
denominator (range of missing for each item, by product: n = 0-5 for cigars,
n = 0-4 for e-cigarettes and hookahs, n = 0-3 for smokeless tobacco,
and n = 0-1 for snus pouches).
d Questions regarding reasons for use were asked separately for past 30-day
use of traditional cigar, cigarillo, and filtered cigar. Any respondents reporting
past 30-day use of 2 or more types of cigars were asked to report on reasons
for use for each type of cigar separately. Responses were aggregated so that if
the reason was endorsed for any of the types of cigars, it was counted overall
as a positive response.
