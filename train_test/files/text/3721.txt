Introduction
The aim of this study has focused on the process of social
exclusion of transsexual people in Spain. Social exclusion is
defined as the denial or unfulfillment of civil, political, and
social rights of the citizens, paying special attention to the
mechanisms and effects of the discriminatory social practices
as a reflection of individual experiences (Room, 1995). The
European Union (1993) defines social exclusion as the inability
to enjoy social rights with no help (because of the individual's
limited self-esteem), to face the individual's own duties,
because of the risk of being set aside as an assisted individual
and being stigmatized in the cities and neighborhood where he
or she lives. Some years later, the concept is extended to include
all the different social spheres, relating it to the equality of
opportunities and referring to all the people who are not allowed
to benefit from the vital opportunities of a society. From our
point of view, social exclusion is a process of gradual distanc-
ing from a situation of social integration, which structural
mechanisms prevent social groups that are different from the
heterocentric dominant position from actively taking part in the
economic, social, political, and cultural spheres of a society.
This concept includes three key aspects that can explain
what it is to be outside or inside the society:
·
· Structural origin. Social structure, inequalities, and
social disruption result in the difficulty in gaining
access to the market society and to the different social
spheres that prevent transsexual people from having a
high quality of life and social welfare.
·
· Multidimensional character. There are many sectors
or dimensions that can affect social exclusion, such as
political, social, economic, cultural, and health fac-
tors, which feed back into each other and hinder the
inclusion.
·
· Nature of the process. It is a continuum. It is a process
that begins with a situation of vulnerability and may
increase over time. In this specific case, social exclu-
sion can result from a previous situation of vulnerabil-
ity. Nonetheless, there is a Copernican shift when the
person decides to have a new identity, either a male or
female transsexual identity. This process begins with
a social exclusion, and it usually results in the most
absolute social marginalization due to prejudices,
social rejection, and the lack of opportunities and
social expectations.

Impact of Social Exclusion in Transsexual
People in Spain From an Intersectional
and Gender Perspective
Luis Miguel Rondón García1 and Dolores Martin Romero2
Abstract
Social exclusion refers to the processes by means of which individuals and groups of people have limited rights and opportunities
to become fully integrated into society. In Spain, several social and legal developments have taken place. However, they
have not necessarily resulted in real social advancement and equality for transsexual people. This discriminatory situation
is organized within a structural and legal framework, which does not satisfy the particular needs of transsexual people. This
reality, coupled with social intersubjectivity and a predominance of ignorance and negativity (both of which are directed by
a dominant gender), requires a global strategy to address its structural, cultural, and intersubjective dimensions. A global
strategy of this sort should originate from a participative perspective. By using a variety of methods, this article deals with the
above issues, as well as the social factors and problems that limit the empowerment and social inclusion of this collective in
a heterocentric society that is increasingly plural and diverse.

According to the aforementioned concepts and from this
point of view, the main objectives of this study are
·
· To show the relationship between social factors and
social situation of transsexual people in a heterocen-
tric society that prevents their integration in equality
conditions;
·
· To analyze the ways of social exclusion and the effects
on social inequality of transsexual people;
·
· To identify stigma and intersectionality as elements
associated with the empowerment of these people.
Social Exclusion Based on Gender and
Sexual Identity
We can add an extra factor of social inclusion to the poverty
situation or social inequality in people with male or female
sexual identity. Sexual identity is a relatively nonvisible
stigma, which is hidden to avoid rejection and social exclu-
sion. The lack of a specific socialization and the limited
social and familiar affiliation results in a series of categories
of social exclusion in those homosexual, bisexual, and trans-
sexual people who do not achieve the category of subjects.
These factors can be seen in the social recognition as citizens
who enjoy equal rights. Therefore, the experiences lived by
these people must be analyzed by taking into account their
complex relationships with other social-structural character-
istics. To improve their social status and achieve equality, a
series of actions is required to allow the inclusion of trans-
sexual people in the society as subjects of law to build a new
inclusive citizenship, free from differences.
In a heterocentric society, the social and cultural construc-
tion of social rules from a privileged position of heterosexu-
ality may result in a cultural structure that is degrading and
unfair in terms of sexual differences (Fraser, 1997). Social
exclusion of homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual people
highlights more and more questions and problems faced by
these vulnerable and disadvantaged collectives. In the spe-
cific case of the transsexual group, it is a multidimensional
and dynamic process in which different associated exclusive
factors can cause an obvious social disadvantage compared
with the rest of the society or the heterosexual dominant
group. These barriers are shown in social, family relations,
and in exclusive social institutions, all of which prevent their
effective involvement in social and cultural life (Pattnaik &
Mohanty, 2014)
The aforementioned direct discrimination usually over-
laps the legal discrimination suffered by those members of
minority social groups, which can be shown indirectly as
social barriers that prevent this social group from a complete
social emancipation. Legal discrimination is more tangible
than social discrimination, as it is easier to identify, and
therefore to fight against legal grievances, than the decoding
of the mechanisms that are often hidden behind cultural and
social rules of daily practice (Takács, Mocsonaki, & Tòh,
2008). Legal questions, such as the full recognition of the
gender identity, marriage, adoption, and inheritance rights,
or the irregular situation in the case of immigrant transsexual
people facing expulsion, can be decisive factors that limit
social inclusion. Legal recognition of the identity is basic for
these people to join society in conditions of equality and to
be recognized as full and active citizens. It is true that, in the
case of Spain, the law has had a pedagogical effect, recogniz-
ing some values, such as the plurality of family models, the
right to the difference, privatization of the affective relation-
ships, and the overcoming of some sanctioning social rules
as its own. However, there is a long way to go to build and
realize the importance of the invisible and symbolic aspects.
Together with these social factors, we have to take into
account others, which are shown in the casual attribution of the
social perceptions and in the discourse analysis. That is the
case of the impact of the stigma and the exclusion from
the health system. Sexual and gender minority groups usu-
ally have to face different mental and physical problems,
which are referred as minority stress, with a high psychologi-
cal impact on the position of disadvantage suffered by these
people, either in a high level, such as the unequal treatment
in legal or economic institutions, or in the stigma that is
shown in daily interactions and microaggressions (Meyer,
2003). Many types of stigma and exclusion within some
social and economic environments, which can affect health,
might be perpetuated by the tension suffered by minorities as
a result of the imposition of the majority. Together with this
psychological stress, we also found an economic discrimina-
tion due to their low income. We also have to take into
account that there is a lack of opportunities in a working
society that is homogeneous and exclusive, resulting in a
precarious job limited to marginal occupations with little rec-
ognition and no social affiliation.
We have also to mention the social discrimination and
family rejection that affect mental and emotional health of
these groups, reducing the potential of endogenous resources.
The fear of being stigmatized by society and the resultant
stress could be reduced by the social protection and shelter
provided by the family. Few of these individuals start a fam-
ily from their different models, and, in the case of our sub-
jects involved in the study, they either have scarce or a
difficult relationship with their families. In other cases, trans-
sexual people may also have problems to defend their place
or role in the family, to inherit what is legally theirs, or to
express their wishes from puberty, either due to fear or social
pressure. There is also a weak socialization due to the fact
that the family socialized in roles that may be different from
the identity of the transsexual subject. There is no other
social model of reference or pattern to learn how to live in a
society according to one's sexual identity, regardless the
physical condition of the genre role adopted at birth.
The mentioned facts constitute a process of social exclu-
sion from outside to inside. When these subjects assume their
marginal status and internalize the different position granted
RondónGarcía 3
by the dominant society, through stigmas, it, in turn, implies
self-exclusion. Society establishes several means to catego-
rize people as well as features that are considered as ordinary
and normal for the members of those categories. This allows
us to categorize a stranger at first sight because of his or her
appearance and to tell which his or her features and social
identities are. The stigma is a deeply discrediting feature and
implies a double perspective: the one of the discredited per-
son, whose difference is known or is immediately obvious
(when the physical appearance or the body anthropology of
the transsexual person shows ambiguous signs or a different
appearance), and the one of the discreditable person, whose
difference is not known nor immediately detected, and it is
purely symbolic. It is the moment when the rules and social
expectations play a role (Goffman, 1998).
The same features are found in every case: A subject who
could have been easily accepted in an ordinary social inter-
change has a feature that leads us to move away from him or
her when we meet him or her. This subject has a stigma, an
undesirable difference that we have not predicted. Goffman
refers as normal to those subjects who do not negatively
move away from particular expectations, from what is
expected from them. Normal subjects, that is, the heterosex-
ual collective, consider that the person who has a stigma is
not completely human and, according to this perception, they
practice different types of discrimination: We build some
arguments and ideas to explain his or her inferiority and pro-
vide a detailed account of the danger posed by this person.
The stigma implies a social process of two roles in which
the subject is involved, at least in some contexts and some
stages of life. The normal subject and the stigmatized sub-
jects are not people, they are perspectives. Long-lasting fea-
tures can turn a certain subject into a stereotype, and he or
she can play this stigmatized role in almost every social situ-
ation he or she has to face. So, it will be considered as normal
to refer to him or her as stigmatized. Nevertheless, these fea-
tures do not determine the nature of the roles considered as
normal or stigmatized, but the frequency with which the sub-
jects play one or the other. This process makes the transsex-
ual person reproduce the patterns and expectations that
society anticipates from him or her and face some psycho-
logical or symbolic social barriers that can lead him to a seg-
regated transsexual lifestyle and limit his or her chances of
social promotion and advance, as he or she assumes this
symbolic label as normal.
Social Intersubjectivity
According to Foucault (2009), there must be a harmony
between the field and the habitus so that there can be a social
order, which depends mainly on the agents' will to respect
and follow the dominant regulations and the imposed rules.
Then, the habitus reproduces the rules, but, at the same time,
it can change them, transform them, as it has this innovating
character. In this dialectical relationship, the symbolic
capital plays an important role. The symbolic violence is the
mechanism of social reproduction par excellence, which is
kept because people need to be recognized and reinforce
their social identities (Foucault, 2009). This violence is
shown in the invisibility, in the factors that generate social
exclusion, when different people are not admitted in a job
offer or in a social circle. Therefore, it is very difficult to
detect and report, as it is indirect and less visible.
As an alternative to this symbolic and social violence,
Butler (1991) deals with the deconstruction of the oppressive
power relationships, which can be perceived in the language
and in the discourse practice, to show the essentialist cate-
gory with regard to the identity and gender. He focuses on
the deconstruction of the heteronormativity imposed by the
heterosexuality and considered as natural, essential, and
moral, devaluing other options of sexuality (Moon, 2008).
This model is reproduced from the social and human interac-
tions, in the language, and operates in our thoughts and social
life (Livingstone, 2010). These discourses dominate our
thoughts and interactions, establishing a dichotomy of gen-
der, between men and women, male and female, in a binary
way.
The social construction that defines heterosexual identity
as the normal identity creates a stigma that implies a self-
exclusion process of the transsexual people and social barri-
ers within the social, political, educational, and working
environments. As a result of this, a disaffiliation within these
environments is produced, reducing transsexual people to a
second-class citizenship status and limiting their chances to
be socially included. We are socialized and used to accepting
heteronormativity, to allowing and justifying the potential
oppression toward different options, behaviors, and attitudes.
It is a cognitive heuristic concept that identifies what is not
heterosexual as deviated or intelligible (Butler, 1991;
Connolly, 1991/2002; Hodges, 2008; McIntosh, 2001).
Queer theory deals with the deconstruction of oppressive
power relationships that are perceived in the language as nor-
malizing trends of resistance of the liberation movements,
together with the discourse practices. This theory also tries to
show the nonsense of the essentialist categories of sexual and
gender identity. Namaste (2000) holds that sexual minorities
have different interests of gender, and that transgender people
and their experiences have been put aside. He also provides a
critical frame to identify normative processes of categoriza-
tion and identities, paying special attention to the ways of
human differentiation. Excluding policies and practices, and
the denial of their existence in the institutions results in invis-
ibility of these transgender people when they have to face
everyday practices that are reduced to the categories of men
and women. These practices also deny the possibility of other
options that, if considered as positive, can enrich the plural
and heterogeneous society that has loomed in this century.
Full integration will not be possible without the abolition of
transsexual subjectivities, which are still evident in our soci-
ety, minds, and institutions. These patterns are followed when
4 SAGE Open
transphobia and genderism are considered as a conviction or
belief that men and women are the only normal expression of
gender (D. B. Hill & Willoughby, 2005).
Intersectionality
This concept was analyzed by Williams in 1995. This author
suggests that the structure of dominance hinders the attempts
of resistance. He also explains how social and cultural differ-
ences according to the gender can challenge the dominant
hegemonic model. It is a complex system of multiple and
simultaneous oppression structures, which explains the speci-
ficities of sexism as a result of the dynamic intersection
between gender, sex, ethnic group, and social class. This study
has also analyzed the specificity of transsexual immigrant
women, because of the important flow of Latin American
immigrant women to Spain in the last 20 years. In Spain, with
the regulatory processes and the improvement of the civil
rights, the right of gender identity was regulated by the Spanish
Act 3/2007 published on March 15, which regulates the
change of the Civil Registry entry related to a person's sex and
allows to change the person's sexual identity with a previous
medical or psychological report. Transsexuality has also been
categorized as a possible cause to apply for political asylum.A
great number of people from the Southern Cone and the
Caribbean came to Spain searching for human rights and a
decent life. In these cases, cultural differentiation of gender in
their places of origin comes up against the gender construction
of the dominant society and the historical, social, and cultural
construction of the gender identity in Spain. Moreover, we can
also add the concept of social class as another element of
exclusion, as the options and possibilities of social insertion
differ in middle or high class people, with a better socioeco-
nomic status. That is, the combination of gender, ethnic group,
and social class converges as an atomized vector leading to
social exclusion. We also have to take into account the dialec-
tic between gender and interculturality as an independent
binomial when analyzing social exclusion.
Together with all the above mentioned facts, multiple
additional mechanisms of gender discrimination and hetero-
sexism, such as age, situation, and social status, also con-
verge. On many occasions, these women are not only
discriminated due to their transsexual condition, but they are
also stigmatized and despised because they belong to a lower
status, are poor, or have a marginal job. Thus, discrimination
is related not only to gender but also to social classes.
Intersectional subordination often results from a discrimi-
nating factor which, when interacting with other existing
oppression mechanisms, creates a new dimension of disem-
powerment. This analysis reveals the need for a global
approach to the structural and political aspects, and the role
of public institutions in avoiding the perpetuation of these
intersections and the resulting social barriers.
We agree with Spelman (1988) and P. Hill (2000, 2006)
on the critical discussion on the feminist frames, which have
not recognized the importance of the class, sexual, and gen-
der discrimination within the different studies on patriarchy.
There has been a quick advance in certain aspects related to
equality, but with regard to identities and differences this
advance has been slower.
Purdie-Vaughns and Eibach (2008) go back to the concept
of intersectionality, mentioning an interactive model that is
shown in policies, social practices, stereotypes, and stigmas.
According to this, social stigma of transsexuality results in a
two-tailed exclusion. On one hand, society does not establish
policies of inclusion, employment, or integration because of
their different condition or the invisibility represented by
these groups for the public institutions. On the other hand,
the stigma makes these people assume the label of different
or excluded, reproducing the sociocultural stereotypes and
patterns determined by the society, such as working in jobs
related to beauty or sex (vertical segregation) and having a
lifestyle according to these social stereotypes and expecta-
tions. It is the so-called "pink glass ceiling."
The distinction between the additive and intersectional
approach has been studied by Spelman (1988) and Hancock
(2007). McCall (2005) and Walby (2007) have developed
useful theoretical frameworks on the complexity of the inter-
sectionality with regard to identity discourses and construc-
tions. They show that people with social identities considered
as inferior by hegemonic power systems experience these
multiple identities as a whole, spreading into all the social
spheres and going along with them through all their different
evolution stages, from the beginning of their young age to
their maturity or adult age, thus gradually reducing their
chances and potentialities.
The described circumstances show the necessity to review
the Western gender perspective in the approach of transsex-
ual women from different cultural origins, overcoming the
so-called feminist mainstream and recognizing that the
female subject is not a homogeneous category. It is basic to
develop a gender approach, including social, cultural, and
ethnic differences and allowing the analysis of the roles, rela-
tionships, and identities of men and women from their own
logical point of views. It is also necessary to encourage the
internal dialogue on women's right, exploring the intercon-
nections between individual and collective rights (Cobar,
2008).
Method
This study is funded by the Junta de Andalucía (Regional
Government of Andalusia, Spain) and the University of
Malaga (Spain) as a teaching innovation project. It was car-
ried out between 2014 and 2015. For this research, our team
has worked using a plural and mixed methodology, that is,
quantitatively and qualitatively.
The quantitative method consists of a statistical, descrip-
tive, and inferential analysis using SPSS Statistics, Version
22. A transversal design has been carried out using
RondónGarcía 5
questionnaires addressed to both male and female users of the
Servicio de Atención a Personas Homosexuales, Bisexuales y
Transexuales de la Comunidad de Madrid (attention service
for homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual people of the
region of Madrid, Spain) and the Federación Estatal Española
de Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales y Transexuales (Spanish fed-
eration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual people).
This questionnaire measures the level of agreement of the
subjects on the proposed factors generating exclusion, with a
dichotomous scale and multiple choices.
Participants were randomly selected among the people
who got in touch with those institutions, which provided us
with a list. We also used the so-called snowball sampling
technique, which consists of recruiting new subjects
(recruited by existing study subjects). Participation was vol-
untary and anonymous. Data were collected from September
2014 to September 2015.
The triangle interviewing technique was chosen for the
qualitative method. Ten triangle interviews were carried out.
Purposeful questions were agreed together with the techni-
cians and experts of the institutions involved in the study and
with specialists in the field. The length of each triangle inter-
view ranged from 1 hr to 1.5 hr. Atlas.ti software was used.
The analysis of the content of the interviews organizes the
information taking into account several dimensions: social
status of the collective, factors generating social exclusion,
and the role of the socialization agents and institutions
Population and Sampling
There are few studies in the world that have approached
transsexuality estimation. Nevertheless, those few ones show
that there is a higher prevalence of male­female transsexual
people (Hoening & Kenna, 1974; Weitze & Osburg, 1996).
In most of the countries in which this prevalence has been
studied, there is an incidence of transsexuality that varies
from 0.14 to 0.26 per 100,000 people each year. Nevertheless,
this estimation is higher inAustralia and Singapore. In Spain,
according to the incidence data consulted, there are 67 new
cases each year.
There are no official statistics that provide the number of
transsexual people. This is the reason why we have turned to
those Spanish institutions working in this field at a national
level. Those data can show some kind of bias of the sample,
given than almost 50% of those people are provided by
social organizations of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsex-
ual people and by the Spanish federation of gay, lesbian, and
transsexual people, and are users or participants of these
organizations (first source). Another consulted source was
an official agency, the Servicio de Atención a Personas
Homosexuales, Bisexuales y Transexuales de la Comunidad
de Madrid (attention service for homosexual, bisexual, and
transsexual people of the Region of Madrid, Spain).
Main studies and sources agree that the number of trans-
sexual people in Spain ranges from 7,000 to 9,000.According
to the Fundación Española para la identidad de género
(Spanish foundation for the gender identity), the scientific
research carried out in 2015 showed 7,419 transsexual peo-
ple in Spain, of whom 5,522 (74.4%) were female and 1,897
(25.6%) were male. With regard to the origin or ethnic group,
2,826 were immigrants (38.1% of the total population), of
whom 84% were living in Madrid and Barcelona and came
mainly from Latin America (Equator, Brazil, Colombia,
Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama,
and Dominican Republic), although there were also people
from Egypt, Nigeria, and Kuwait, which are the most oppres-
sive countries with transsexual people.
Participants
Most of the participants live in a situation of social exclu-
sion. Their socioeconomic level is medium-low, with low
incomes (one out of three living below the poverty thresh-
old), and almost 50% of them have engaged in prostitution
some time. In a global population, the unemployment rate is
around 35%. According to the estimations of the Federación
Estatal de Lesbianas, Gais, Transexuales y Bisexuales, this
rate could be up to 70% in the case of transsexual, homo-
sexual, and bisexual people.
Results
The results of the quantitative method will be analyzed in the
first place, and then, this information will be completed with
the data collected with the qualitative method, so that the
reasons for social exclusion of transsexual people could be
more thoroughly explained.
From the quantitative data, we can conclude by means of
the analysis of the sociodemographic variables that trans-
sexual people are young, with a high percentage of immi-
grants and mainly female; 40.5% are male versus 49.5%
female. With regard to age, 25.4% are younger than 18 years,
41% (modal data) are between 18 and 25, 20.4% are between
26 and 35, 10.8% are between 26 and 45, and only 2.4% are
older than 46 years. One out of five (20.5%) is immigrant,
mainly from Latin America (Peru, Equator, Argentina,
Venezuela, and Brazil).
As a result of the descriptive statistics, we have catego-
rized social conflicts that most often occur related to gender
identity and which act as the factor generating social
exclusion.
First of all, in the variables related to conflicts, we found
that almost nine out of 10 people (88%) suffer social con-
flicts because of their identity, both during childhood and
puberty, and in the adult age, when they decide to change
their gender. In the access to social institutions and social
life, 33.7% have been victims of social discrimination.
Furthermore, 19.3% have specific conflicts as they get out of
the closet to a new gender identity and break the social rules
and the heteronormativity model, with a higher impact than
6 SAGE Open
the homosexual option. We have to add that 26.5% suffer
conflicts when socially interacting and participating in the
community. Scores obtained in the above mentioned con-
flicts are shown in Table 1.
Second, in the variables related to social environment, we
describe social situation and social problems suffered by this
group. We have to take into account that, although some of
these problems and situations are common in the rest of the
population, due to the specificities and vulnerabilities of
transsexual people, transactions of these factors have a
higher impact and intensity in this particular case, given their
social fragility, social and family disaffiliation, and the lack
of social and labor opportunities. Also, 22.9% have interper-
sonal and familiar problems with their family of origin and
the primary groups of reference, and 19.3% state they have
difficulties of social integration when facing different social
environments, such as employment, education, political par-
ticipation, and so forth. Very few of these people have a part-
ner or start a family from different models (2.7%), and 19.3%
have conflicts within their own family. To family problems,
we have to add the previous ones suffered before founding
their own family, taking into account that 8.1% state to be
rejected or not accepted by their families because of their
transsexual condition. Furthermore, 1.7% have suffered epi-
sodes of gender and familiar violence with their current or
former partners. That is, we can confirm that there are family
conflicts previous to the current situation, and subsequently,
once they have started a family or their own unity of
habitation.
The unemployment rate is high (22.7%). In the current
context of economic crisis, perspectives are limited for trans-
sexual people, even more difficult than for the rest of the
population, taking into account that job opportunities are
vertically segregated and reduced to marginal jobs or jobs
related to beauty or sexual exploitation. Mobbing rate is also
high. Of the male and female interviewees, 7.2% have suf-
fered mobbing due to their identity. Scores obtained accord-
ing to the social status of the transsexual people are shown in
Table 2.
To the social status, we have to add specific health prob-
lems resulting from the problems and social situation, which
have been described. Social problems can result in health
problems, if we take into account that 8.4% suffer psychic
disorders due to the emotional and psychosocial impact of
the gender change and the identity crisis suffered by many of
these people. There are also cases of gender dysphoria.
Because of their disability, 3.2% have functional social
needs, and 1.1% suffer problems of drug addiction; 7.3%
have other health problems. All of this leads us to take into
account this high psychosocial and mental impact apart from
the social exclusion and inequality suffered by transsexual
people in our society, and to consider this health situation as
a factor generating social exclusion.
For the inferential statistics, in the differences detected
with the chi-square statistic, we have found that there is a
statistical significance in the correlation of the following
variables: conflicts of identity, discrimination, social prob-
lems, mobbing, and socialization.
The statistical tests show the incidence of the specific
social factors that limit social inclusion of transsexual people
because of their identity. Nevertheless, other descriptive and
adescriptive factors, such as the age, the type of family, and
getting out of the closet, are not statistically significant. So,
we can conclude that the mere fact of belonging to a male or
female identity different from the dominant heterocentric
model implies a specific social difficulty, which results in
discrimination, different social problems, and difficulties to
access to the different spheres, which define socialization
environments.
In the specific case of immigrant people, the chi-square
test has provided some additional significant results in the
following variables: age, unemployment, familiar conflict,
and discrimination. According to the tests that have been car-
ried out, there is an added factor of exclusion or social spe-
cific problem in immigrant transsexual people, as we have
already mentioned in our initial hypotheses. Apart from the
above mentioned social exclusion factors, we have to add
social problems of social discrimination due to their trans-
sexual and immigrant condition: unemployment (which
severely affects) and different familiar conflicts. Age is also
related to social exclusion in immigrant people. From an
intersectorial perspective, we can state that social status, gen-
der, and ethnic group represent a complex system of simulta-
neous structures that lead to social exclusion, just because of
being transsexual and immigrant, that is, different.
From the qualitative data, we have found in the triangle
interviews some explanations regarding how these factors
generating social exclusion occur. These are the following:

· Economic and employment environment. The
employment is unstable and jobs are vertically segre-
gated within the field of beauty, domestic care ser-
vices, and marginal jobs. The level of education and
training is low. Immigrant women survive thanks to
charity and prostitution. In the case of male transsexu-
als, jobs are more normalized, but in any case, unem-
ployment is very high. "Nobody is going to hire me in
a shopping center as a shop assistant or secretary if
they know that I am transsexual" said Subject 1. "As I
am immigrant and also transsexual, the only option I
have found in Spain is prostitution" said Subject 5.
·
· Social groups and networks. In the collective imagi-
nation, there are some stereotypes and stigmas related
to transsexuality, which hinder their access to social
groups and networks. Social affiliation and participa-
tion is limited, reduced to groups made up of trans-
sexual people. In the case of immigrant transsexual
people, they usually socialize with Latin American
people. These primary groups are the main social link
and support they have. "People look at me in the
street. If I am seated next to heterosexual person in a
pub or public place, we are the center of attention,"
said Subject 8.
·
· Family. Few of them found their own families in spite
of the legalization of same-sex marriages. We can talk
about familiar estrangement in general and specific
difficulties to start their own family. "Men look for a
heterosexual woman to get married" said Subject 4.
"Men only want me for sex, but not for something
else, not for introducing me to their families" said
Subject 9. In the case of immigrant women, their fam-
ilies living in their origin places do not know their
new orientation. "I have not said anything to my fam-
ily about my new life in Spain. They would not under-
stand it" said Subject 6. Sometimes they are rejected
by their families and they have difficult relationships,
without taking part in family events or rites.
·
· Social discrimination. Discrimination is worse in
homosexual people, as they radically break with the
dominant heterocentric model, with a higher impact
than in other options. According to the subjects' state-
ments, they have been rejected because of their exces-
sive femininity (female transsexual) and masculinity
(male transsexual) when they were children or teenag-
ers. Once they have changed their identity in the adult
age, they feel more rejection than when they presented
themselves in society as homosexual. "Many times,
when I go to public institutions to do some paperwork,
I dress as a man to look like a very feminine gay,
instead of a transsexual woman because they treat me
better with more respect," said Subject 10. "When I
became transsexual, I thought that discrimination
would end. I did not think it was going to be worse,"
said Subject 7.
·
· Cultural environment. If we understand gender as a
construct with a historic, social, and cultural origin,
we can find some differences of understanding gender
in immigrant people. In the interviews, female trans-
sexual people often talked as if they were men, and
they called themselves gays. "In my country there is a
gay or a man, transsexuality is not understood," said
Subject 6. We also find differences in the processes of
social inclusion of male and female transsexual peo-
ple, as female ones have more difficulties because of
the cultural construction of gender and social inequal-
ity socially built around the female symbols.

transsexual people according to the information collected in
the triangle interviews:
Conclusion
Social exclusion of transsexual people has some specific
characteristics. It is articulated within a structural and regula-
tory framework in which the social intersubjectivity and the
construction of the dominant gender in the heterocentric
society represent an added element of exclusion. The lack of
specific socialization and reference models, and social and
familiar disaffiliation, results in a situation of evident social
inequality, which hinders the mechanisms to reach the recog-
nition as citizens enjoying equal rights. It is a multidimen-
sional and dynamic process where several social, economic,
family, and employment factors and community participa-
tion converge. All of this can cause a social disadvantage

with regard to the rest of the people who belong to the domi-
nant heterosexual model. These barriers have a social, cul-
tural, and, also, symbolic origin. Transsexual people fight
against the social exclusion and inequality. This fight is
going to be a long battle, and it is not only a question of legal
rights and equality but also a question of equity and human
rights (Pattnaik & Mohanty, 2014).
As social exclusion is not only structural but also sym-
bolic, it is a process, which in a long term, can result in social
marginalization. Vertical and horizontal segregation, diffi-
culties to get a job, reducing the possibilities of transsexual
people to unstable jobs or to prostitution, implies worse
social conditions, social discrimination, and hinders their
social mobility and to be fully included in the society.
The subjective experiences of the people involved in the
study show complex stories, with tensions between the soci-
ety and the intersubjectivity (Ali, 2014). Those elements rep-
resent an argument to criticize the dominant hegemonic
model and the policies of social and gender inclusion. The
postmodern theory needs to delve into these questions from
the perspective of the queer theory, allowing to build the dis-
courses of the difference in an equality position, where there
are different regulatory models in which everybody can fill,
beyond the binary classification of man and woman.
There are a lot of models of identity, sexual orientation,
and differences according to the gender, and each one needs
to be approached from their differences and specificities,
understanding this diversity as a positive and unifying ele-
ment in a plural and heterogeneous society. It is necessarily a
social and politic empowerment of transsexual people,
breaking the traditional heteronormative hegemony of gen-
der, from a perspective that perceives those people as active
subjects, as a part of the society, because the intersectorial
subordination is a factor of oppression and discrimination.
The above mentioned circumstances clearly show the need to
review the Western perspective of gender, in the approach to
transsexual people, incorporating social, cultural, and ethnic
differences from the plurality of approaches and views.
The stigma built around transsexual people is a discredit-
ing feature that establishes some differences regarding what
is considered as normal, from the privileged and normalized
position of heterosexuality, which stigmatize transsexual
people, compared with other social groups. It is an interac-
tive model, evident in policies, social practices, and stereo-
types, which involves the invisibility or denial of the
transsexual collective and its reduction to a marginal group
or to second-class citizens. Moreover, many transsexual peo-
ple assume this label, which results in their self-exclusion.
There is another additional element of exclusion regarding
immigrant transsexual people who stand for a third of the
global population. Regulatory development and advances in
the last 10 years have not been translated into equal rights and
have not had the desired pedagogical effects. As for immi-
grant people, there is a social and differential construction of
the gender and there are also some specific factors of social
exclusion that can result in social marginalization with the
lack of access to the social resources due to their irregular
status. Immigrants and transsexual people suffer a significant
social discrimination, unemployment, and the lack of
resources and social protection. So, to the exclusion because
of their condition of transsexual, we have to add the condition
of immigrant, as they belong to a disadvantaged social class.
