ABSTRACT
BARREIRA, T. V., P. T. KATZMARZYK, W. D. JOHNSON, and C. TUDOR-LOCKE. Cadence Patterns and Peak Cadence in US
Children and Adolescents: NHANES, 2005­2006. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 9, pp. 1721­1727, 2012. Cadence (steps per
minute) is one of the temporal­spatial parameters of walking gait, is related to intensity, and can be used to identify patterns of
ambulatory behavior in free living by tracking time spent at incrementally higher cadences. In addition, peak cadence, a simple indicator
of best natural ambulatory effort, can be captured. Such indicators have been used to study adult ambulatory behavior in a representative
sample, but similar analyses for children and adolescents are limited to a single small and select sample. Purpose: The study's purpose
was to describe in children and adolescents 1) free-living cadence patterns (i.e., time spent at incrementally higher cadence bands) and 2)
peak cadence indicators (i.e., peak 60 min, peak 30 min, and peak 1 min) by sex, age, and body mass index. Methods: Cadence patterns
and peak cadence were derived from 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey accelerometer data represent-
ing 2610 children and adolescents (1281 boys and 1329 girls, age 6­19 yr). Data were described by sex, age group (6­11, 12­15,
and 16­19 yr), and body mass index­defined weight status (normal, overweight, obese). Results: On average, US children and ado-
lescentsspent;4hIdj1 at zero cadence during wearing time, ;8.9 hIdj1 between 1 and 59 steps per minute, ;22 minIdj1 at cadences of
60­79 steps per minute, ;13 min at 80­99 steps per minute, ;9 min at 100­119 steps per minute, and ;3 min at cadences Q120 steps per
minute. Peak 60-min, 30-min, and 1-min cadences were 72, 85, and 118 steps per minute, respectively. Conclusions: US children and
adolescents seem to spend relatively few minutes in daily life engaged in activities that elicit step accumulation patterns indicative of
normal walking speeds, let alone those associated with higher intensity activities. Key Words: STEP COUNTS, STEP FREQUENCY,
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NHANES
Children and adolescents can benefit from a physi-
cally active lifestyle (30). The 2008 Physical Ac-
tivity Guidelines for Americans (30) recommend
that children and adolescents engage in at least 60 minIdj1
focused primarily on moderate- to vigorous-intensity phys-
ical activity (MVPA). With the escalating use of body-worn
objective activity monitors (including pedometers and accel-
erometers), there has been an increasing interest in translating
this time- and intensity-based recommendation into a reason-
ably approximate amount of ambulatory activity expressed as
steps per day (1,3,6,18,20). Although steps per day is known
to be associated with time spent in higher intensity activities
(1,3,22), it is more clearly an indicator of total volume of
physical activity. A recent review has introduced the concept
of using cadence (steps per minute) to describe step accu-
mulation patterns as a way to study free-living ambulatory
behavior (29). Improving cadence is known to be the primary
strategy for increasing free-living walking speed in adults (23)
and children (12), and although stride lengthening supersedes
this strategy as running speed incrementally increases, cadence
still increases at least to some degree (17). Recently, cadence
has also been used to describe intensity of ambulation in lab-
oratory studies of young people (10,11,15,16). For example,
Graser et al. (11) asked 10- to 12-yr-old boys and girls to wear
a pedometer and walk on a treadmill at 3, 3.5, and 4 mph and
concluded that, in general, cadences above 120 steps per
minute were associated with MVPA. In addition, we know
from short-distance walking tests (8) that expected cadence
at self-selected preferred walking speed is 126.14 T 10.29
steps per minute for 10-yr-olds.
We recently published 2005­2006 National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES) accelerometer data
to describe cadence patterns of free-living US adults Q20 yr
(25). We reported that US adults accumulate ;4.8 hIdj1 at zero
cadence during accelerometer wearing time, ;8.7 hIdj1 be-
tween 1 and 59 steps per minute, ;16 minIdj1 at cadences of
60­79 steps per minute, ;8 minIdj1 at 80­99 steps per minute,
;5 minIdj1 at 100­119 steps per minute, and ;2 minIdj1 at
cadences Q120 steps per minute (25). In a separate analysis of
these data (24), we reported the descriptive epidemiology of

peak 30-min cadence (defined as the average steps per
minute recorded for the 30 highest but not necessarily con-
secutive minutes in a day) and peak 1-min cadence (defined
as the steps per minute recorded for the highest single min-
ute in a day). We found that US adults average a peak 30-min
cadence of approximately 71 steps per minute and a peak
1-min cadence of approximately 101 steps per minute.
Further, both peak cadence indicators displayed significant
and consistent decrements with increasing age and levels of
obesity as defined by categories of body mass index (BMI).
We know of only one study of free-living cadence in
children or adolescents at this time. Bjornson et al. (5) used
the StepWatch Activity Monitor (Orthocare Innovations,
Oklahoma City, OK) to examine the stride rate patterns of
428 normally developing children and adolescents 2­15 yr.
Their analysis was from a comparison cohort and was not
based on a representative sample, and they did not report
peak cadence to the extent that we presented in our analysis
of NHANES adults (25). Therefore, there is an opportunity
to analyze the NHANES children and adolescent data to
explore peak cadence rates and cadence patterns in a sample
representative of the US population. Because physical ac-
tivity guidelines for young people recommend Q60 minIdj1
of healthful physical activity, it makes sense that peak ca-
dence indicators be extended to reflect this focus. Further,
changes with growth and development require that cadence
data be examined by sex and age groupings (6­11, 12­15,
and 16­19 yr). Therefore, these analyses of the 2005­2006
NHANES accelerometer data served the dual purposes of
describing in children and adolescents 1) free-living step
accumulation patterns using cadence and 2) peak cadence
indicators (i.e., peak 60 min, peak 30 min, and peak 1 min)
by sex and age groups and by BMI category.
METHODS
Participants. The National Center for Health Statistics
ethics review board approved all NHANES protocols, and
all participants were asked to provide informed consent.
Parental/guardian consent was obtained for minors. As in
previous research that described steps per day in children
and adolescents using these 2005­2006 NHANES data (28),
2610 participants who were 19 yr or younger, had at least
one valid day of accelerometer data (defined later), and had
complete height and weight data were included in these
analyses. BMI was transformed into the following categories:
normal weight, overweight, and obese on the basis of sex- and
age-specific cutpoints for children and adolescents (7).
Instruments. The NHANES is designed to assess the
health and nutrition status of adults and children in the United
States and, in the 2005­2006 survey cycle, used the Acti-
Graph model 7164 accelerometer (formerly the CSA/MTI
AM-7164, manufactured by ActiGraph of Fort Walton Beach,
FL) to assess step-defined physical activity (as well as other
outputs not focused on here). The ActiGraph 7164 (5.08 Â
3.81 Â 1.27 cm), which is no longer distributed by the man-
ufacturer, has been well described previously (9). Briefly, it
used a single-axis accelerometer designed to measure vertical
accelerations while worn at the hip. The output frequency was
0.25 to 2.5 Hz, digitized by an analog-to-digital converter,
and stored in 1-min intervals. Step data are not available from
the 2003­2004 NHANES cycle, which also collected accel-
erometer data.
Procedures. NHANES participants who were at least
6 yr and not limited in their ability to walk or otherwise wear
an accelerometer were recruited to wear it for seven con-
secutive days during all waking hours (removing it at night
and for any water activities, including showering). Height and
weight were measured using standard procedures. Additional
information about all measurements, including more details
about the accelerometer protocol, can be found at http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/BM.pdf.
Data treatment and analysis. A SAS macro (http://
riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) supplied by the
National Cancer Institute was used to determine nonwear
time (defined as Q60 consecutive zeros, allowing minimal
interruptions). To keep consistent with previous analyses of
these data, a valid day was defined as having at least 10 h of
accelerometer wear time and at least one valid day of data,
which was shown to eliminate bias due to more active par-
ticipants wearing the accelerometer for more days (28).
Adhering closely to procedures published describing ca-
dence patterns in adults (25), cadence was extracted from the
data without any manipulation (e.g., censoring below any
specific activity count cutpoint [28]) because our objective
was to present the full range of cadence as detected by the
instrument. Cadences were then organized into bands of
approximately 20-step-per-minute increments: 1­19, 20­39,
40­59, 60­79, 80­99, 100­119, and 120+ steps per minute.
The amount of time (minIdj1) and steps per day accumu-
lated within each cadence band were computed, as well as
the time spent at zero steps per minute (excluding nonwear
time). In addition, the peak 60-min, peak 30-min, and peak
1-min cadences were computed by rank ordering the data for
each day for each participant and then averaging steps per
minute accumulated over the top 60, 30, and 1 min (as ap-
propriate) across valid days.
All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC) sample survey procedures to account for the
complex NHANES sampling design. The SURVEYREG
procedure followed by pairwise contrast analysis was used
to compare cadence bands and peak cadence values between
age, sex, and BMI groups. We set the > level at 0.001 to
conservatively interpret significance amidst multiple com-
parisons in this large sample. To ensure national represen-
tativeness of results, sample weights were used to account
for oversampling and nonresponse.

by sex are presented in Table 1. Mean wear time displayed a

narrow range from 804 to 843 minIdj1 (13.4 to 14.0 hIdj1)
across the sex­age groups. There were no significant dif-
ferences for wear time among the groups.
The number of minutes per day and steps per day accu-
mulated within each cadence band for the overall sample
and by sex are presented in Table 2. During wear time, US
children and adolescents spent, on average, 242 minIdj1
(;4 hIdj1) at zero cadence, ;534 minIdj1 (8.9 hIdj1) be-
tween 1 and 59 steps per minute, ;22 minIdj1 at cadences
of 60­79 steps per minute, ;13 minIdj1 at 80­99 steps
per minute, ;9 minIdj1 at 100­119 steps per minute, and
;3 minIdj1 at cadences Q120 steps per minute. On average,
approximately 7500 steps per day were accumulated between
1 and 59 steps per minute, and fewer than 400 steps per day
were accumulated at 120 or more steps per minute. Signifi-
cant differences were noted between boys and girls for time
at zero cadence and for the number of steps per day and
minutes per day accumulated at cadences of 20­39, 40­59,
60­79, and 80­99, all P G 0.001.
Table 3 displays minutes per day and steps per day accu-
mulated within each cadence band by age group. Time spent
at zero cadence ranged between 189.5 and 298.6 minIdj1
(about 3 to 5 hIdj1), and fewer than 4 minIdj1 were spent at
cadences of 120 or more steps per minute in all age groups.
Overall, children and adolescents accumulated more than
60% of steps per day at cadences between 1 and 59 steps per
minute. The minutes per day and steps per day accumulated
within each cadence band for each sex­age group are pre-
sented in Figure 1A and Figure 1B, respectively. Time spent
at zero cadence ranged from ;3 hIdj1 for 6- to 11-yr-old boys
and girls to ;5 hIdj1 for 16- to 19-yr-old boys and girls.
Time spent at 1­19 steps per minute ranged from ;6.7 hIdj1
for 6- to 11-yr-old girls to ;6 hIdj1 for 16- to 19-yr-old girls,
and steps per day accumulated within this cadence band on
average ranged from about 2731 to 2161 for the same sex­
age groups. Time accumulated within each incremental ca-
dence band was progressively lower until the lowest value of
1 minIdj1 was observed in the 120+ steps per minute ca-
dence band for boys 16­19 yr. Significant differences were
observed between sex­age groups for all except the 80­99
cadence band.
The peak 60-min, peak 30-min, and peak 1-min cadences
are presented in Table 4. The peak 60-min cadence ranged
from a low of 67 steps per minute for the 16- to 19-yr-old
girls to a high of 75 steps per minute for 12- to 15-yr-old
boys. The peak 60-min cadence mean was 72 steps per
minute for the total sample. Significant differences were
observed between boys and girls for the total sample and
within the 12- to 15-yr-old age group. In addition, statisti-
cally significant differences in peak 60-min cadence were
apparent between the 6- and 11-and 16- and 19-yr-old age
groups. The peak 30-min cadence ranged from 82 steps per
minute (for both boys and girls age 16­19 yr) to 88 steps
per minute (for boys age 12­15 yr), and significant differ-
ences were noted between the 6- and 11- and 16- and 19-yr-old
age groups. The peak 1-min cadence ranged from 108 steps
per minute (for boys age 16­19 yr) to 124 steps per minute
(for girls age 6­11 yr). Significant differences were iden-
tified for both sexes between the youngest and oldest age
groups and between 12- and 15-yr-old boys and girls. Peak
60-min cadence was 73, 71, and 67 steps per minute for
normal-weight, overweight, and obese BMI-defined weight
categories, respectively. Significant differences were ob-
served between the normal-weight and obese groups for all
peak cadence indicators and also for peak 1-min cadence
between the overweight and obese groups.
DISCUSSION
Free-living cadence has been previously derived from the
NHANES adult accelerometer data and described as minute-
by-minute step accumulation patterns organized into incre-
mental cadence bands (25) and also as peak cadence, a

simple indicator of best natural ambulatory effort (24). Be-
cause we know of no other study of free-living cadence in
children or adolescents in representative samples at this time,
these analyses extend the adult findings. For all age groups
and for both sexes, the majority of time (mean = 10.5 hIdj1)
is spent at zero cadence or accumulating 1­19 steps per
minute during the monitored day (mean = 13.7 hIdj1). Thus,
on average, 3.2 hIdj1 is spent in cadence bands accumulat-
ing 20 or more steps per minute and only a relatively small
amount of time (G3 min) is spent at a cadence Q120 steps
per minute. However, US children and adolescents do av-
erage approximately 50 minIdj1 taking 60 or more steps per
minute, a cadence range indicative of purposeful and incre-
mentally higher intensity ambulatory activities (25,26).
To facilitate comparison, the previously collected adult
data (25) are displayed alongside the data for children and
adolescents by age group (6­11, 12­15, and 16­19 yr) in
Figure 2. Also, as previously described, this sample of US
children and adolescents averaged approximately 13,000
(boys) and 12,000 (girls) accelerometer-determined steps
per day (28), considerably more than the US adults who av-
eraged approximately 9600 steps per day (27). Despite appar-
ent differences in volume of steps per day, when categorized
into incrementally higher cadence bands, the children's and
adolescents' data display step accumulation patterns similar
to adults. The most notable difference is that US children and
adolescents average approximately 40 minIdj1 less at zero
cadence (i.e., nonmovement) and approximately 30 minIdj1
more at cadences Q40 steps per minute than US adults.
In adolescents, short-distance gait tests of similarly age
boys and girls demonstrate that girls self-select a higher

cadence under controlled testing conditions (31,32). These
objectively monitored NHANES data show that there were
no statistically significant differences, however, between boys'
and girls' free-living highest single minute or best 30 min of
the day, suggesting that these indicators are overall more a
reflection of natural behavior than sex-associated height/leg
length differences. Table 2 reveals that, although there are
no sex differences regarding time spent at cadences Q100
steps per minute, boys spent significantly more time at ca-
dences between 20 and 99 steps per minute, and this is
reflected by the significantly higher peak 60-min cadence in
boys compared with girls. Compared with the shorter peak
cadence indicators, the peak 60-min cadence will be more
affected by the relative persistence of a behavior during a
day. The observed sex difference in peak 60-min cadence
(i.e., boys 9 girls) is consistent with what is known based on
other physical activity measurement approaches (4).
Extrapolating from these cross-sectional data, it seems
that as children age, they tend to spend increasingly more
time at zero cadence, shifting on average from 189.5 minIdj1
at ages 6­11 to 298.6 minIdj1 at ages 16­19. Children
age 6­11 yr also tend to spend more time and take more
steps per day at cadences G80 steps per minute than the 12-
to 15- and 16- to 19-yr-old groups. Although significant
differences were found, the overall time spent and steps per
day taken at cadences of 100­119 and 120+ steps per minute
were similarly low (on average) for all the age groups
highlighting the need to enhance promotion of activities that
can elicit such cadences across the board.
Similar to the study by Bjornson et al. (5), which reported
only peak 1-min cadence, the older age groups analyzed
herein had slightly lower values than the younger age
groups. As well, the peak 30-min and peak 1-min cadence
values for the 16- to 19-yr-old adolescents were higher than
those previously reported for adults (peak 30 min = 63 steps
per minute and peak 1 min = 91 steps per minute) (24). Al-
though differences between age groups could be attributed
to development that occurs with age, the mechanical work
and the muscular efficiency during walking for children
Q10 yr are not different from adults when normalized to
body mass (21). During late adolescence, both boys and
girls are likely to have attained adult height (19). In addition,
Beck et al. (2) tested children between 2 and 15 yr and
demonstrated that for an average speed of 1.04 mIsj1, the
stride length was 76% of the child's height. With those
results in mind, it is possible to conclude that as children
get older and taller, they can walk faster at a similar cadence
rate or decrease cadence to walk at a similar speed. How-
ever, the present study focuses on the description pattern of
sex- and age-specific step accumulation and as an expres-
sion of naturally occurring ambulatory behavior. Certainly,
the conclusions about time spent at zero cadence cannot be
influenced by development or stride length, and, therefore,
it more clearly represents a behavior.
Children and adolescents classified as obese had lower
values for all peak cadence indicators than those classified
as normal weight by BMI. Peak cadence is an indicator used
to capture natural best-effort ambulatory activity expressed
under free-living conditions. As an average of the best min-
utes of a day, it is shaped not only by its magnitude but also
by the number of minutes considered. Even when considering
only the best single minute (where magnitude would matter
most), obese children and adolescents attain lower values
than their normal-weight peers. This free-living finding is
consistent with gait analyses studies that also show that obese
children have lower cadences at all walking speeds (13,14).
Interestingly, the NHANES data demonstrate that even over-
weight children/adolescents had a higher peak 1-min cadence
than obese children/adolescents. There was no difference,
however, in the peak 30-min or peak 60-min cadences. The
longer duration peak cadence indicators increasingly reflect
the persistence of the behavior. Overall, it seems that obese
children/adolescents do not achieve cadences that are as
high as those attained by either overweight or normal-weight
children. However, neither overweight nor obese children
sustain these cadences for accumulated durations when
compared with normal-weight children. This is an interesting
nuance that we do not believe has been presented previously
and thus requires additional investigation to illuminate un-
derlying factors contributing to these BMI-defined behav-
ioral differences.
As previously stated, we know from short-distance
walking tests (8) that the expected cadence at self-selected
preferred walking speed is 150 steps per minute for 6-yr-old
children and 126 steps per minute for 10-yr-olds. However,
in this representative sample of free-living US children and
adolescents, only a relatively small portion of time was spent
at comparable cadences. In addition, just a few minutes were
spent taking Q120 steps per minute, which Graser et al. (11)
suggested to be associated with MVPA in 10- to 12-yr-old
boys and girls. Unfortunately, there has been little research
beyond the study by Graser et al. that provides alternative
age-specific values. We would expect the value to be higher

in younger children and lower as adolescents develop into
adults. The MVPA-associated cadence value for adults is
Q100 steps per minute (26). Interpreted against the results of
gait speed tests and this crude single-cadence threshold of-
fered by Graser et al., our findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that many US children and adolescents have
relatively few minutes in daily life when they engage in
activities that elicit step accumulation patterns indicative of
normal walking speeds, let alone those associated with
MVPA. In all sex-by-age groups, the average peak cadences
were well below the 120 steps per minute associated with
MVPA for children (11). Only six children (of 2610) had a
peak 60-min cadence above 120 steps per minute, and only
22 were above 100 steps per minute. The average time
above 120+ steps per minute was only 2.5 min for the entire
sample and was 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 min for the 6­11, 12­15,
and 16­19 age groups, respectively.
Many limitations in this study must be acknowledged.
This report is focused on ambulatory physical activity, and it
does not fully capture the more complex activities that in-
clude upper body movements (e.g., gymnastics, volleyball)
or water activities like swimming that would also be con-
sidered of at least moderate intensity. This is a descriptive
study of step accumulation patterns of US children and
adolescents. Additional analyses are planned to examine the
association of cadence indicators with various health
parameters. Whereas at higher cadences, the values repre-
sent actual stepping rates for 1 min, at lower cadence bands,
we are representing a pattern of how steps are accumulated
within a minute. It is not realistic to think that children and
adolescents are walking in ``slow motion'' at a step rate of
G40 steps per minute. The lower cadence steps were likely
accumulated at a much faster rate and in a time interval
shorter than 1 min. As intensity of activity increases and
sustained durations are shortened, the effect will be larger.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to investigate bouts in a
more flexible manner because the 1-min data collection in-
terval was preset. We acknowledge that dividing detected
steps by smaller time frame denominators suggests higher
stepping rates; however, Tudor-Locke and Rowe (29) have
recently argued that ``the purpose of studying free-living
minute-by-minute step accumulation patterns is to relay the
execution and relative persistence of naturally occurring
ambulatory behavior.'' Finally, these analyses represent
population averages that minimize individual realities. For
example, if two children obtained peak 60-min cadence
values of 120 steps per minute and a third child obtained 70
steps per minute, the ``sample'' average would be only 103
steps per minute. The few cases with very high peak cadence
values are thus reduced by the very larger number of cases
with very low values.
In summary, this study provides descriptive data for US
children and adolescents for time and steps per day accu-
mulated within incrementally higher cadence bands and
peak cadence indicators for 60, 30, and 1 min. These refer-
ence data are important and can be used for surveillance,
tracking, comparison, screening, intervention, and evalua-
tion purposes. On average and for all age groups and for
both sexes, the majority of time during the day is spent at the
1- to 19-steps-per-minute and zero-cadence (10­11 hIdj1)
bands, and a very small amount of time (G3 minIdj1) is
spent at cadences Q120 steps per minute. Although there are
no sex differences with regards to time spent at cadences
Q100 steps per minute, boys have a higher peak 60-min ca-
dence than girls, reflecting their higher amounts of time
spent at 20­99 steps per minute. A finding that bears re-
peating is that, overall, children and adolescents seem to
have relatively few minutes in daily life in which they en-
gage in activities that elicit step accumulation patterns
indicative of normal walking speeds (derived from short-
distance gait tests), let alone those associated with MVPA.
The results also indicate that interventions to increase
physical activity and, in particular, opportunities for persis-
tent brisk ambulation or faster types of locomotion are nec-
essary at an early age for both boys and girls if they are to
establish and sustain habitual healthy ambulatory activity
levels before entering adulthood.
