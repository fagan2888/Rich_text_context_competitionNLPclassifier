Indian states have been facing traffic related issues including traffic congestions and
accidents for decades. The situation has worsened with time due to the increasing popu-
lation. This article investigates the causes behind the accidents and provides recommen-
dations and measures that would bring forth an improvement in the traffic conditions.
The research uses forecasting models to confirm the existence of traffic problem in the
State of Kerala. The various reasons for the accidents were enumerated and classified.
Using regression models, the relationship between the number of accidents, deaths,
and injured were obtained. In addition, the relationship between the number of acci-
dents and the number of vehicles on road were examined along with the type of vehicle,
design of the roads, the design of traffic, and the design of road network.
In addition, a simulation model is presented to study the effect of the change in design
of roads on the traffic situation. As an example, a 15-minute time period can be used
to count the number of vehicles of each type (buses, cars, and trucks) travelling in
both directions on a major highway. This data can then be categorized into slow and
fast moving traffic. The Mean time between arrivals, percentages of slow and fast
vehicles, percentages of vehicles travelling in both directions can be calculated and used
in ARENA simulation software to perform discrete event simulation. Various scenarios
are simulated; and waiting times and potential number of accidents are found for each
of the scenarios.
Based on forecasting, regression and simulation models, this article provides several
recommendations and managerial insights, which are believed to alleviate the traffic
problems in the State of Kerala. The solution approaches from this research could be
used for addressing similar traffic situations in other states of India, which could result
in saving millions of lives over the next decade.

326 SOLVING TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF KERALA, INDIA: FORECASTING, REGRESSION AND SIMULATION MODELS
Kerala has been facing traffic related issues for
decades. The situation has worsened with time
due to the increasing population. In the recent
past, a project sponsored by the World Bank announced
an award to any organization or an individual, who
could successfully address the traffic situation in the
state. Subsequently, IBS Software Services developed
a software system for the police department to help
identify the traffic problems. However, the system did
not help significantly in reducing the number of acci-
dents. This research, conducted in year 2007­2008, is
an attempt to investigate the causes behind the acci-
dents and provides recommendations and measures
that would bring forth a reduction in traffic accidents
in Kerala.
LITERATURE REVIEW
There is extensive literature in the area of fatalities
related to traffic. We first present the research articles
from the Western countries and then discuss those from
India, as the vehicle types and traffic conditions are
significantly different in both contexts.
Clarke et al. (2010) studied a sample of 1,185 fatal acci-
dents in 10 UK police jurisdictions during the years
1994­2005. They showed that the primary causes
of accidents were excessive speeding and drunken
driving with the drivers having alcohol levels beyond
the permissible limit. In addition, the young age of
the drivers, driving in the night, and the failure to
wear seat belt are contributors to these fatalities.
Gjerde et al. (2011) studied 204 fatally injured drivers
in South-eastern Norway from 2003­2008. The risk for
fatal injury in a road traffic accident was estimated using
logistic regression adjusting for gender, age, season of
the year, and time of the week. They showed that the
risk for fatal accidents was high with intake of multiple
drugs or alcohol by the drivers. Spoerri, Egger, and Von
(2011) examined socio-demographic and geograph-
ical determinants of road traffic accident mortality
in Switzerland by linking 2000 census data to the
mortality records from 2000­2005. Data from 5.5 million
residents aged 18­94 years, 1,744 study areas, and 1,620
accidental deaths were analysed, including 978 deaths
(61.2 per cent) among motor vehicle occupants, 254
(15.89 per cent) among motorcyclists, 107 (6.69 per cent)
among cyclists, and 259 (16.21 per cent) among
pedestrians. Weibull survival models and Bayesian
methods were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and
standardized mortality ratios (SMR) across study
areas. They showed a u-shaped relationship with age
in motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists. For
cyclists and pedestrians, mortality increased after the
age of 55 years. Mortality as a function of education
(primary, tertiary) and civil status (single, married) was
also discussed. They suggested that preventive efforts
should aim to reduce inequities across socio-demo-
graphic and educational groups, and across geograph-
ical areas, with interventions targeted at high-risk
groups. Ayuso, Guillén, and Alcañiz (2010) used multi-
nomial logistic regression to analyse accidents with
victims and calculate the influence of different types of
traffic violations on the probability of having a serious
or fatal accident, compared to a smaller accident. The
data for this study was based on accidents that occurred
in Spain from 2003 to 2005. The average cost per victim
and the average number of victims per accident were
then used to find the estimated cost of an accident with
victims, given the information on the type of traffic
violation incurred. They presented some recommenda-
tions on the severity of penalties, and suggested that
regulators penalize the occurrences of some specific
combinations of traffic violations more rigorously.
In the Indian context, Mohan and Bawa (1985)
attempted to understand fatal crash patterns in Delhi in
the 1980s. The results of the study indicated that fatality
patterns in Delhi were different from those in highly
industrialized countries. Pedestrians, two-wheeler
riders, and bus commuters comprised 80 per cent of the
fatalities while motor-vehicle occupants comprised a
small minority. The authors proposed some short-term
and long-term safety countermeasures for Delhi which
were significantly different from those in more indus-
trialized high-income countries. Sahdev et al. (1994)
undertook a study of road traffic fatalities in South
Delhi to determine the injury patterns and incidence of
deaths that could be prevented by optimal utilization of
available medical resources. According to them, the
majorityofthepreventabledeathsresultedfromafailureto
diagnose or treat an injury and that an improvement
in hospital management of intracavitory hemorrhage
could prevent 70 per cent of the deaths. Sood (1988)
studied the different factors influencing the fatality of
injury among two-wheeler motor accidents. One key
observation was that the helmet users had a much lower
incidence and severity of head injury than the riders
who did not use helmets. Jain et al. (2009) studied the
trend of two-wheeler accidents over the period, 2000­
2004, with respect to age and sex of the victim, type
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 327
of injury sustained, type of vehicle involved, and time
distribution of accidents. Among 1,231 accidents, 77 per
cent of the victims were in the age group of 18­44 years,
and the accident rate among males (83 per cent) was
higher than those among females (17 per cent). They
further concluded that the highest number of accidents
occurred at a certain time of the day (6 p.m.­10 p.m.).
THE STUDY
This article contains three separate areas of analysis
that are linked to each other in the following order:
(1) The first step was to evaluate the existing traffic acci-
dent problem in Kerala. This consisted of forecasting
the number of accidents, number of people died in
accidents, and number of people injured in acci-
dents, using standard forecasting techniques. Time
series models such as Moving Averages, Single and
Double Exponential Smoothing, Winters' Method,
and Neural Networks were used.
(2) The second step was to verify the impact of acci-
dents. This was achieved by regressing the number
of accidents with the number of deaths and the
number of injured.
Once the impact of accidents was measured, the
factors contributing to the increase in the number of
accidents were determined. To achieve this, regres-
sion analysis was performed with the number of
accidents against the vehicle type, the number of
vehicles, and the density of vehicles. In addition,
regression was used to identify the relationship
between the increasing number of vehicles on the
roads and the accidents. Using data from all the
states in India, another set of regression was done
with the number of deaths against the number and
type of vehicle. When the number of vehicles did
not give a good regression coefficient, various trans-
formations were applied on the number of vehicles,
in search of a higher regression coefficient.
Pareto analysis of accidents vs. vehicle type was
used to determine the highest contributors to the
accidents by vehicle type, and this information
was then used in the regression analysis of vehicle
type vs. number of deaths. The Pareto analysis also
ranked the accidents by vehicle type which helped
in focusing on accident causing vehicles.
(3) The third step was to present a simulation method-
ology to redesign the road network which would
reduce the traffic accidents significantly on national
highways. We used Discrete Event Simulation models
to study the effect of the change in the design of roads,
traffic, and road networks on the traffic accidents.
Here, the dataset was obtained by direct observation
of traffic on a national highway. A 15-minute time
period was used to count the number of vehicles of
each type (buses, cars, and trucks) travelling in both
directions on NH-47, a major highway in Kerala. This
data was then categorized into slow and fast moving
traffic. The mean time between arrivals, percentages
of slow and fast vehicles, and percentages of vehicles
travelling in both directions were calculated and used
in ARENA simulation software to perform discrete
event simulation. Various scenarios were simulated;
and waiting times and potential number of accidents
were found for each of the scenarios. Based on the
analysis of these scenarios, we present several recom-
mendations and trade-offs.
DATA
The data on road accidents, the number of deaths in
accidents, and the number of people injured in acci-
dents were obtained from online sources such as: Public
Works Department, Government of Kerala and the
Kerala State Crime Records Bureau. (Edayaranmula,
2005; Table 1, Appendix I).
The data collected from these sources were used for
performing statistical analysis and making recommen-
dations for reducing traffic accidents using forecasting,
regression, and simulation models discussed above.
ANALYSIS
An analysis of the number of accidents, deaths, and
injuries in accidents, using forecasting, regression and
simulation techniques are presented below.
Forecast of Accidents
The data on the number of accidents in Kerala from
1990 to 2005 showed an increase over the years (Table
1, Appendix I). The number of accidents was forecasted
based on the publicly available data from the State
Crime Records Bureau, Kerala Police (Edayaranmula,
328 SOLVING TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF KERALA, INDIA: FORECASTING, REGRESSION AND SIMULATION MODELS
2005). A summary of errors for the various forecasting
methods used to forecast accidents is given in Table 1.

Source: Authors' analysis.
Notes: MAD = Median Absolute Deviation; MAPE = Mean Absolute
Percentage Error.
From Table 1, neural network method appears to be
the best method for forecasting. The forecasting exer-
cise indicates an increase in the number of accidents--
39,917 accidents in year 2007 to 42,197 accidents in year
2017; (Table 1a, Appendix I). If no measures are taken,
the number of accidents will continue to increase.
Forecast of Number of Deaths in Accidents
The number of deaths in traffic accidents in Kerala was
forecasted with the same data and techniques used for
forecasting the number of accidents. The actual data on
the number of deaths has an upward trend from 1990 to
2004 with a downward dip from 1995 to 1998 (Appendix
I, Table 1b). A summary of errors for the various fore-
casting methods used to forecast the number of deaths
in the accidents is given in Table 2.

accidents

Single exponential smoothing 86 3.6
Double exponential smoothing 340 14

Source: Authors' analysis.
It can be inferred from Table 2 that neural network fore-
casting is the most appropriate method. The forecast
using this method indicates that the number of deaths
in accidents would remain at more than 3,000 per year
for the next 10 years (Appendix I, Table 1b). The actual
number of deaths in accidents for the years 2005 to 2007
substantiates this forecast.
Forecast of Number Injured in Accidents
The actual data on the number of injured in accidents
in Kerala has an upward trend from 1990 to 2004 with
a downward dip during 1995­1998 (Table 1c, Appendix
I). A summary of errors for the various forecasting
methods used to forecast the number injured in the
accidents is given in Table 3.

Source: Authors' analysis.
Based on the above MAD and MAPE, Single Exponen-
tial Smoothing method appears to be the most accurate.
The forecasts using this method as well as the Neural
Network method indicates that there is no significant
decrease in the number of people injured over a span
of 10 years.
Regression
Number of Accidents vs. Number of Deaths
A regression analysis was performed to understand
the relationship between Number of accidents and
Number of deaths. An R-Square of 94.9 per cent
confirms the general understanding that accident
deaths are correlated to the number of accidents. The
regression equation is:
Number died = 829.9243 + 0.05039 * Number of accidents.
This shows that the number of deaths increases with
the increase in accidents (See Table 2a, Appendix I for
summary regression output).
Number of Accidents vs. Number of Injured
An R-Square of 96.32 per cent confirms that accident
injuries are correlated to the number of accidents. The
regression equation is:
Number of injuries = 1970.081 + 1.292561 * Number of
accidents
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 329
This shows that injuries increase with the increase in
the number of accidents (See Table 2b, Appendix I for
summary regression output).
Pareto Analysis--Accidents vs. Vehicle Type
Figure 1 demonstrates the results of the Pareto analysis
of the publicly available data (NATPAC, n.d.) to inves-
tigate the correlation between the number of accidents
and the vehicle type.
As can be seen from the Pareto chart, two-wheelers
contribute to 41.4 per cent of the accidents. Auto-
rickshaws, cars, and private buses, add up to make 79.2
per cent of all accidents.
Vehicle Type vs. Number of Deaths
The R-square was significant only in one case;
two-wheelers, at 87.9 per cent, indicating a high corre-
lation between two-wheelers and the number of deaths
in accidents (Table 2c, Appendix I). The regression
equation is:
Number died = 287.519 + 0.001462 * Total number of
two-wheelers.
Reciprocal of Vehicles vs. Number of Accidents
A regression was run to determine the correlation
between the number of accidents and the number
of vehicles on the roads. As this did not yield an
R-square of more than 80 per cent, regressions were
tried with various transformations on the number of
vehicles, which included squaring, taking a square
root, using logarithm and a reciprocal. The regres-
sion with the reciprocal was the only transformation
that yielded an R-square close to 80 per cent (Table
2d, Appendix I).
The regression equation is:
Number of accidents = 48496 - 1.64E + 10 reciprocal of
vehicles.
The R-square obtained (78.9 per cent) shows a high
correlation between the reciprocal of the number of
vehicles and the number of accidents.
Vehicles per km vs. Number of Accidents
The R-square of 83.4 per cent indicates a high correla-
tion between the number of vehicles per kilometre and
the number of accidents (Table 2e, Appendix I).

330 SOLVING TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF KERALA, INDIA: FORECASTING, REGRESSION AND SIMULATION MODELS
Simulation
Based on the findings of the regression methodology, a
simulation model is presented here to redesign the roads,
traffic, and the road network, that could help reduce the
traffic accidents significantly on national highways.
The goal of the simulation model was to reduce the
number of unsuccessful switches by redesigning traffic
and/or roads, and at the same time minimizing the
waiting time.
A two-lane highway is defined as one that has traffic
in both directions (one lane going North and one lane
South). The traffic rules do not legally allow vehicles to
pass other vehicles by switching temporarily to the lane
with incoming traffic. However, many vehicles do not
adhere to these rules. Typically, they tend to pass the
vehicle in the same lane, by crossing into the lane in the
opposite direction. It then tries to switch back to the orig-
inal lane, which cannot be accomplished, if the original
lane is busy. All of this slows down the traffic resulting
in traffic congestion, or may lead to a head-on collision.
Main Features of the Model
The simulation was modelled using ARENA soft-
ware. The lanes were considered as resources. Each
resource could accommodate only one vehicle at a
time. Slow vehicles took a longer time to be processed
when compared to the fast moving vehicles. Direction,
lane, speed (1 or 2), and entity type were assigned.
If the lane (resource) was busy, the vehicle switched.
The false branch from the next switch decision within
a decide module gave rise to a number that we called
"possible accidents." The objective was to reduce that
number without significantly increasing the waiting
time of the vehicles. The following five scenarios were
considered: Base, No passing at all, No passing for slow
traffic, Passing only for North-bound fast traffic, and
Four-lane highway (implies upgrading and rede-
signing of the highway). The fifth scenario required a
separate model. Refer to Appendix II for an illustration
of the simulation models.
Major Data Needed (Input)
The following data was needed for simulating the
scenarios in ARENA: (1) Mean time between arrivals of
vehicles (both South-bound and North-bound); (2) The
fraction of slow and fast vehicles (both South-bound
and North-bound); (3) The process or value added
times for slow and fast traffic (assumed to be 8 and 3
seconds, respectively); (4) The switch or transfer times
(assumed to be 2 seconds).
Key Performance Measures (Output)
The following key performance measures were consid-
ered: (1) Waiting time for each entity type (categorized
by direction, speed and lane); (2) Total time for each
entity type that includes value added, waiting and
transfer times; (3) Possible accidents.
Data Collected by Direct Observation
Different types of vehicles were counted by physically
observing the traffic between 5:15 p.m. and 5:45 p.m.
during three different weekdays on NH-47 between
Thrissur and Palakkad. This data was used to calcu-
late the mean time between arrivals, as well as the
percentage of slow and fast vehicles in both directions.
Simulation Results
The base scenario reflects the existing traffic situation
and places no restriction on overtaking. Although the
waiting time is the lowest for this scenario, it is the
main reason behind traffic accidents on the highways.
The second scenario is where no passing is allowed.
This yields the highest waiting times, but presumably
would result in zero accidents. So, the traffic was cate-
gorized into fast (tempos, KSRTC buses, private buses,
cars, and two-wheelers) and slow vehicles (trucks).
The third scenario is to allow fast vehicles to pass and
prohibit slow vehicles from overtaking. This seems to
be a good trade-off as it can be seen from the waiting
times and the total travel time on the highway. The
fourth scenario allows only fast North-bound vehicles
to pass. North-bound was chosen because it has more
traffic than South-bound. Nevertheless, as it can be seen
from the simulation results, this significantly increases
the waiting times for the South-bound traffic.
"Possible accident" implies that a vehicle that has
switched to the opposite lane would not be able to
come back to the original lane due to traffic. This
would lead to two possible scenarios: (1) The vehicle
would wait to get into the original lane and as a result it
would force the traffic in the opposite direction to wait.
(2) It would collide head-on with the vehicle coming
from the opposite direction. "Possible accidents" are
highest for the base scenario and none for the second
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 331
scenario (where no passing is allowed). Even though
the second scenario is preferred, it leads to increased
waiting times. The third scenario looks promising, as
it reduces potential accidents by 17 per cent without
significantly increasing waiting times. While the fourth
scenario reduces potential accidents by 47 per cent, this
solution may not be acceptable to the commuters trav-
elling South-bound.
Therefore, the third scenario (prohibiting slow vehi-
cles like trucks from passing) seems to be the best
option, but it still results in accidents. Thus we recom-
mend Scenario 5, where we upgrade two-lane high-
ways to four lanes (with two lanes in each direction).
This decreases waiting times, eliminates head-on colli-
sions, and reduces the "Possible accidents". Scenario 5
could be expensive to implement due to the high costs
involved in building the new lanes (construction, main-
tenance, land acquisition), as well as the relocation costs
for residents living near the highways. See Appendix
III for detailed simulation results.
Recommendations
Design of Roads
Design of roads is an aspect worth reviewing in order
to reduce accidents on the roads of Kerala.
Conversion of one-way highway to a four-lane
highway (two lanes in each direction) is one solution
that can ease traffic accidents. The simulation model
supports this by showing that the waiting time is
reduced significantly. The simulation also shows the
complete absence of the module "possible accidents".
The possibility of head-on collision is brought to zero
in this model, because the rule permits changing lanes
in the same direction as the traffic. Nonetheless, the
trade-offs involved with increasing one-way to a four-
lane highway cannot be neglected. Apart from the huge
cost of construction and maintenance of the highway,
land acquisition for expansion has cost, effort, time,
legal and ethical implications.
Design of Traffic
Considering the problems in redesigning of the roads,
redesigning of traffic seems more feasible. We now
experiment with simulation models that implement
restrictions on overtaking, conditionally and uncondi-
tionally. In this set of models, restrictions are imposed
on passing (changing to the opposite lane while
overtaking). Currently, there are no restrictions on
passing and any vehicle can pass any other vehicle at
any time. This is the base scenario for the simulation.
In this scenario, if a vehicle sees another vehicle in the
same lane, it tries to overtake that vehicle by changing
to the lane with on-coming traffic (provided there is no
vehicle in that lane). After switching to the opposite
lane, it is necessary that they come back to the original
lane immediately. However, the original lane may not
have space for this vehicle, and that may result in two
possible scenarios: Either this vehicle waits for the orig-
inal lane to be available or it collides head-on with the
vehicle from the on-coming traffic. In the first scenario,
it slows down the traffic, sometimes confusing vehi-
cles in the opposite lane, and even the vehicles in the
original lane. The second scenario results in a head-on
collision. Combined, these two scenarios constitute
the module "potential accidents". The objective of the
simulation experiments is to minimize this number.
There are three variations from the base scenario. The
first is where no passing is allowed for any vehicle.
Even though this solution results in zero "potential
accidents", it would be rejected by the public because
it adds to the waiting time of the fast moving vehicles.
Another experiment allows passing only for fast vehi-
cles in one direction (in this case, North-bound) that has
higher traffic. But this was found to increase waiting
times for South-bound traffic significantly. Thus, a
reasonably good solution implied placing restriction
on just the slow moving traffic.
An advantage of redesigning the traffic lies in the
opportunity to implement changes that address the
peak hour traffic, and any condition specific to the
roads in consideration. Even though only highway
traffic was studied for the simulation, with additional
appropriate data, the results could be applied to state
highways as well.
The Pareto analysis indicates that two-wheelers are
involved in 41.4 per cent of the accidents. The regres-
sion analysis also revealed a high correlation (R-square
= 87.9 per cent) between two-wheelers and the number
of deaths. The corresponding regression equation is:
Number died = 287.519 + 0.001462 * Total number of
two-wheelers.
The above results indicate the significant role of
two-wheelers in accidents. So, a possible solution is
to have a separate lane for two-wheelers which may
contribute significantly to the efforts of reducing the
332 SOLVING TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF KERALA, INDIA: FORECASTING, REGRESSION AND SIMULATION MODELS
number of accidents. This would not incur huge costs,
as it would involve reserving a part of the existing road
space for two-wheelers.
Design of Road Networks
A couple of regressions were run to determine the
correlation between the number of vehicles and acci-
dents. An R-Square close to 80 per cent was found
between the reciprocal of the number of registered
vehicles and the number of accidents (Table 2d,
Appendix I). An R-square of more than 83 per cent
was discovered between the number of vehicles per
kilometre and the number of accidents (Table 2e,
Appendix I). The main reason behind traffic acci-
dents was the significant increase in the number of
vehicles without a corresponding increase in the road
space. Thus, more roads need to be constructed, espe-
cially from the suburbs to the city. This would result
in commuters taking different routes, and therefore,
reducing traffic accidents.
The Kerala expressway was planned to connect the
tips of Kerala's northern and southern boundaries.
This would benefit business and regular commuters.
Unfortunately, the construction work is moving at
a slow pace, as the infrastructure costs are extremely
high; therefore, enhancing existing roads seems to be a
better option.
The redesign of traffic provides an opportunity to
implement changes that address the peak hour traffic.
Even though only national highway traffic was studied
for the simulation, with additional appropriate data,
the results could be applied to state highways as well.
Design of Road Networks
The regression results show significant correlation
between the number of vehicles and accidents, the
number of vehicles per kilometre and the number of
accidents. The main reason behind traffic accidents
is the significant increase in the number of vehicles
without a corresponding increase in the road space.
Thus, more roads need to be constructed, especially
from the suburbs to the city. This would result in
commuters taking different routes, thereby reducing
traffic accidents. The planned addition of over 12,000
kilometres of expressways in the next 10 years may
help address some of such issues (Wikipedia, n.d.).
Due to high construction costs and the amount of
time taken to build new expressways, we recommend
enhancing the existing roads.
FUTURE RESEARCH OPTIONS
Though the following factors are not part of our research
study, we briefly mention these miscellaneous recom-
mendations that deserve consideration and could be a
part of future research topic.
The Time of Day
The increase in accidents at night seems to be concen-
trated in two districts in Kerala and therefore further
investigation in this area is required.
Enforcing Traffic Rules
The drivers and pedestrians should comply with
the traffic rules and this must be strictly enforced.
For instance, it is not uncommon to see two adults
and two children on a two-wheeler, where only 2
adults and 1 child are legally allowed to travel by a
two-wheeler. Further, concerned over the rising number
of two-wheeler accidents, the Kerala High Court has
suggested an amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act and
Rules, prohibiting women in sarees from riding pillion
on two wheelers and carrying more than one child on
the vehicle (Sebastian, 2008).
Emergency Calling System
Having an efficient emergency calling system like the
911 in the United States and expanding the 108 emer-
gency services to all the states across India (currently
operational in about 20 states and two Union Territories
in India), might help decrease the number of deaths
and injured in accidents.
Prohibition of Alcohol
AstudyconductedbytheAlcoholandDrugInformation
Centre (ADIC) has revealed that around 40 per cent of
the road accidents in India in general and 72 per cent
on the national highways are due to drunk driving
(Edayaranmula, 2005). Kerala has one of the highest
per capita consumption of alcohol in the country.
Prohibition of alcohol may help reduce the road acci-
dents to a great extent.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2016 333
Improvement in Quality of Roads
Defective road condition affects two-wheelers the
most and there could be a correlation between bad
road conditions and two-wheeler accidents. Thus, it is
suggested to construct better roads with quality mate-
rials and increase the frequency of road maintenance.
Enhancing Efficiency of Police:
Despite the fact that speeding and traffic violations are
very common, the commuters are not held accountable
for these violations like in western countries such as the
United States. A large and efficient police force can help
in strict implementation of laws for safety.
Curbing Corruption
Corruption may be in the form of bribing officials for
granting drivers' licence without taking the road test.
There should be a process to strictly enforce the licensing
procedure and take action against corrupt officials.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
To conclude, the traffic accident situation in Kerala is
projected to worsen over the years based on the fore-
cast of accidents and the number of deaths and injured
in accidents. Among the different contributing factors,
two-wheelers and vehicle overtaking are found to be the
primary factors causing accidents. This research finds
that redesign of the traffic is an effective way to address
these two issues. We recommend reserving a separate
lane for two-wheelers in suburbs and cities, and strictly
enforcing the helmet law. For commuters on highways, it
is recommended to implement restrictions on overtaking
based on the speed of the vehicle and traffic specific to
that region. The other recommendations are to improve
the condition of roads and upgrading the two-lane high-
ways to four-lane highways. We believe this would
effectively address the traffic accidents currently faced
by the state of Kerala.
The simulation models discussed in this article could
be extended to include "the time of the day when
accidents occur" besides the other miscellaneous
factors discussed in the article as potential areas of
future research. In addition, this methodology could
be used for addressing similar traffic situations in
other states/cities of India (Transport Research Wing,
2001­02). These recommendations and the underlying
managerial insights might alleviate the traffic accidents
in the country.
