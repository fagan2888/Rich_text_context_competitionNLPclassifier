Abstract
Newer forms of community-based participatory research (CBPR) prioritize community
control over community engagement, and articles that outline some of the challenges
inherent in this approach to CBPR are imperative in terms of advancing knowledge and
practice. This article outlines the community control strategy utilized by Trans PULSE,
an Ontario-wide research initiative devoted to understanding the ways in which social
exclusion, cisnormativity (the belief that transgender (trans) identities or bodies are less

authentic or `normal'), and transphobia shape the provision of services and affect health
outcomes for trans people in Ontario, Canada. While we have been successful in
building and supporting a solid model of community control in research, challenges
have emerged related to: power differentials between community and academic part-
ners, unintentional disempowerment of community members through the research
process, the impact of community-level trauma on team dynamics, and differing visions
about the importance and place of anti-racism work. Challenges are detailed as `lessons
learned' and a series of key questions for CBPR teams to consider are offered.

Background and rationale
A growing literature addressing the value of community-based participatory
research (CBPR) is showing promising evidence about its practical application
and contribution to solving real world problems (Viswanathan et al., 2004).
CBPR is a process for undertaking research that involves community and academic
partners committing to identifying, researching, and offering solutions to the com-
plex challenges facing communities (Israel, Schulz, Parker, & Becker, 1998;
Minkler & Wallerstein, 2003). CBPR also strives to use transparent and equitable
decision-making structures, open writing and publishing processes, maximum
attention to the marginalization that communities face, maximum respect for com-
munity knowledge, and a full commitment to community engagement and action
outcomes (Flicker, Travers, Guta, Macdonald, & Meagher, 2007; Minkler, 2005;
Travers et al., 2008).
Stoeker (2012) notes that CBPR is offering communities access to the
`knowledge-power' loop, thereby positioning them as creators of knowledge rather
than passive recipients of so-called `expert' knowledge, which can be inaccurate and
oppressive. Yet, as CBPR gains credibility, new questions are emerging about the
inherent challenges in operationalizing its principles (Stoeker, 2012; Travers et al.,
2008). For example, while CBPR appears to address ethical considerations and
questions, such as whether communities are consenting to, benefiting from, or
being harmed by research (Guta et al., 2010), questions remain about who is
really in control of the agenda in CBPR. For example, Jacobs (2010) speaks to the
need to `truly empower' community members by being open to them as `co-thinkers'
and `co-organizers' at all stages of a research project, in order to be really successful.
Critical questions about real and meaningful community participation in CBPR
have been raised through Stoeker's (2012) analysis of funding protocols to a
US-based funder of action-oriented research. Community-based organizations or
community members were rarely involved in helping to define research questions or
404 Action Research 11(4)
study methods, and few studies explicitly linked research goals to action-oriented
outcomes. Indeed, the greatest involvement of community members was likely to
occur during data collection, raising significant doubts about any meaningful
power sharing between community and academic partners (Stoeker, 2012).
Travers et al. (2008) found a similar set of challenges facing Ontario's HIV/
AIDS sector, despite its reputation as being an international leader in CBPR.
Community members tended to be more involved in knowledge dissemination
stages of research, while academic researchers were in greatest control during
study formulation and data collection stages (Travers et al., 2008).
`The right amount of community participation'?
For some time now, academics have attempted to theorize models of citizen par-
ticipation that would move lay people from tokenistic roles in partnerships with
academics into roles characterized by greater decision-making and power-sharing.
Articulating a typology of citizen participation, Arnstein (1969) differentiates the
amount and depth of citizen participation according to gradations of non-
participation, tokenism, and citizen power. Pretty, Guijt, Thompson, and
Scoones (1995) offer another model with `no participation' on one end of the
spectrum of involvement and `self-mobilization' of community on the other. Ray
(2007) distinguishes between `traditional' (community members provide informa-
tion), `consumerist' (community members are there for researchers to achieve their
end goals) and `democratic' (a model of community involvement in research part-
nerships, where the latter attempts to redistribute power. Common to all CBPR
models are the democratic and empowering characteristics of community engage-
ment, and a genuine desire to challenge dominant power arrangements (Jacobs,
2010). However, at one end of the CBPR spectrum are more `traditional' forms of
research processes that value community input while academic researchers retain
control, ownership and management. At the other end, are newer forms of CBPR
that position community members as `owners' (instead of `partners') of projects.
The `Community Owned and Managed Research Model' (Heaney, Wilson, &
Wilson, 2007) is just one example of such an approach in which communities
retain control, ownership and management, while choosing academic partners
and `valuing' their input through collaborative memoranda of understanding.
While `community-owned' research is gaining in popularity as a new frontier in
CBPR, reflections on some of its successes and challenges will be helpful in enhan-
cing the work of future CBPR teams.
Method
This article describes the strategy and approach used by an Ontario, Canada,
CBPR collaborative ­ Trans PULSE ­ to develop and implement a project that
was firmly committed to prioritizing community needs and concerns, valuing lived
experience, and attending to action outcomes. On the CBPR spectrum, Trans
Travers et al. 405
PULSE has committed to (and operationalized) community control, while retain-
ing funding and management within academic settings in order to work within
established bureaucratic frameworks. In presenting this strategy, we attempt to
provide a concrete example of one way of conceptualizing and operationalizing a
CBPR project ­ one in which discourse was, from the beginning, less about `com-
munity engagement' and much more about `community control'. We describe the
history of the project, as well as the development of its innovative community
engagement and capacity-building strategies. Through a process of retrospective
reflection, we offer some of the important lessons learned along the way about this
approach, and some questions for other CBPR teams to consider in their own
work. The authorship of this paper is made up of a mixture of academic research-
ers, community investigators and students from Trans PULSE.
Our individual and collective reflections, which incorporate learnings from con-
versations throughout the project are represented throughout. Given that we rep-
resent a subset of Trans PULSE, and that we as authors experienced the project as
individuals within a larger group dynamic, it is important to note that differing
interpretations of a similar issue or phenomenon may exist but we were able to
arrive at consensus in this article. As such, we are reticent to make bold conclusions
such as `x caused y', and instead, we draw upon the wisdom provided by others in
the literature to frame our understanding of phenomena that are actually, at times,
quite complex.
Key aspects of community ownership in the Trans
PULSE project
Trans PULSE is an innovative, mixed-methods, CBPR project that responds to
problems and concerns identified within Ontario trans1 communities regarding
health and access to health and mental health services. The project is particularly
centered around understanding the ways in which social exclusion, cisnormativity
(the belief that trans identities or bodies are less authentic or `normal'), and trans-
phobia shape the health of, and provision of services for, trans people in Ontario.
Some of Trans PULSE's focus areas include: employment and income, housing,
health care, transition-related care, relationships and family, sexual health, HIV
vulnerability, mental health, community connectedness, and access to social ser-
vices. The team has a successful history of funding from foundations and provincial
and federal granting bodies,2 and of production of research results for multiple
audiences.3 Prior studies with trans people in other regions have found that trans
people's health is profoundly affected by disproportionately high rates of violence
and harassment (Lombardi, Wilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2001), employment dis-
crimination and job loss (Minter & Daley, 2003), and discrimination in the provi-
sion of health and social services (Namaste, 2000). From the inception of Trans
PULSE, a commitment was made to undertake research that respects this lived
experience, the resilience and capacity of trans communities, and community
knowledge and needs.
406 Action Research 11(4)
The Trans PULSE community engagement strategy includes both research and
action stages, and builds on the theoretical model proposed by Paez-Victor (2002).
The stages of this model include input (activities related to study initiation and
design), process (activities related to data collection, analysis and interpretation)
and outcome (activities related to dissemination and social action). In developing
the model, particular attention was paid to the roles of community members in each
stage of the research process, as well as issues related to community control, power-
sharing, and social action; indeed, the project's tag line is `Trans PULSE: Building
Our Communities Through Research'. Three central principles have informed the
community engagement strategy for Trans PULSE: 1) community initiation; 2)
continual building of capacity; and 3) community control (versus community
engagement) over each project stage. The third central principle, community own-
ership, forms the core of the project and this article. It is evidenced in part by com-
munity initiation, and informs the need for community capacity-building. However,
the impacts of community ownership go far beyond these principles.
Community initiation of the research project
Unlike most CBPR initiatives, Trans PULSE was driven by community members
since its nascent stages. Trans PULSE was initiated by a group of trans community
members and a cisgender4 ally, and was supported by a municipally funded LGBT
community centre and a provincially funded community health centre with a man-
date to provide primary health care to LGBT communities in Toronto. As a first
step, the initial group sought additional community team members through an
application process, and then following that added academic partners.
Community members interviewed and selected research partners from academic
institutions and non-governmental organizations based upon five distinct criteria:
1) their ability to be allies; 2) their ability to bring resources to the project; 3) their
history of progressive forms of LGBT research; 4) their potential to let trans people
be experts in their own issues; and 5) their ability to provide research-related
expertise and skills for building a sound and rigorous study design for future
phases of Trans PULSE. While not all of the initial Trans PULSE members saw
themselves as investigators, the shift in thinking happened quickly as CBPR-
friendly funders (who welcomed non-academic, community co-investigators)
were identified, and successfully applied to. Over eight years, this community­
academic partnership was built, and when some community investigators left
others were recruited to replace them. Based on community feedback we received,
priority was placed on recruiting new investigators who were trans members from
racialized communities.
Building knowledge upon lived experience
Trans community members were instrumental in defining the research project's
overall goals and objectives, as well as its theoretical framework. Most centrally,
Travers et al. 407
community priorities directed us to move beyond individualistic explanations for,
and accounts of, health; instead, we prioritized a `social determinants of health'
(Raphael, 2009) lens in our research. Two community investigators were hired as
part-time research coordinators to manage the workload during this stage of the
project; through this experience, these coordinators developed the skills and cap-
acity required to undertake and organize complex CBPR projects. Through dis-
cussions among the Investigators' Committee (IC), we created research goals,
objectives, and questions, and selected appropriate and sensitive methodologies
for subsequent stages of the research. Taking direction from community soundings
(focus groups) that we held in select Ontario cities, the IC felt strongly that research
methods be used that allowed for the voices and concerns of trans people to be
heard, in addition to dispelling the myth that trans people exist in negligible num-
bers. Consequently, a mixed methods approach was chosen for Trans PULSE. The
IC collectively felt that the use of the most rigorous methods possible was import-
ant for ensuring that we could produce results that would be less likely to be
dismissed. An approach was chosen which combined respondent-driven sampling
(Heckathorn, 2002) with subsequent qualitative interviews. Once these decisions
were made, a collaborative funding proposal was developed and submitted. It was
successful and the survey phase of Trans PULSE commenced.
Survey design: Prioritizing `community knowledge'
The process of developing the Trans PULSE survey tool offered further opportun-
ity for community input, capacity development, and community control. Building
upon the items that were identified as important research priorities during the
community soundings, IC members spent a number of sessions together as a
team in order to identify further priorities for research. Drawing upon their lived
experiences, community IC members offered many directions for the content of the
survey tool, and participated in bringing the survey to fruition. The resulting tool
was comprehensive in its scope, and community IC members were able to see
firsthand how `lived experience' and other forms of community knowledge can
be drawn upon to shape the content and design of a research tool.
Steering committee membership and decision-making
The Trans PULSE IC has had majority trans community representation and
control from its beginning. Each IC member has been assigned an equal voice,
irrespective of their academic or organizational affiliation, and each has been
designated as an investigator on at least one project funding application. The
fact that early stages were driven by non-academic trans community members
has been pivotal in shaping a culture of community control that has continued
into subsequent phases of Trans PULSE. In its earliest stages, the Trans
PULSE team agreed to a Terms of Reference (TOR), a contract that guides the
work of the project. Stressing community integration, community control and
408 Action Research 11(4)
capacity-building in all project phases, the TOR functions as a memorandum of
understanding, stating guiding principles, decision-making processes, team member
roles and responsibilities, and policies for accessing data. An element of note is that
the TOR mandates that trans community investigators will always constitute a
majority of the Investigators' Committee, and must be present in majority numbers
(50% plus one) for major project decisions. This helps to ensure that we prioritize
community ownership in Trans PULSE in ways that go beyond typical CBPR
initiatives.
Broadening community input
Despite the fact that the majority of the Trans PULSE IC comprised trans com-
munity members, we recognized that the IC did not represent the diversity of trans
people or `trans experience' in a province as large and populous as Ontario.
Wanting to ensure a representation of community experience beyond our IC, the
team held `community soundings' to hear priority issues and concerns from
85 trans people and four allies in three Ontario cities (Ottawa, Guelph and
Toronto). Trans members of the IC also contributed their lived experience to the
development of an online sounding for service providers, by determining the key
topic areas to be covered. Professionals and providers who worked with trans
community members were consulted through this survey to help us identify their
knowledge and training needs in relation to working with trans clients.
To ensure even broader community input into Trans PULSE, a Community
Engagement Team (CET) was established, to provide many things, including: guid-
ance into the development of the project's survey tools and interview guides, access
to relevant geographically dispersed trans networks, strategic advice on project
outreach and promotion, and direction and guidance on a `knowledge to action'
strategy for social change. The CET was comprised of 16 well-connected trans
people, who were selected through a province-wide application process. They
reflected (as best as possible) Ontario's geographic, ethno-racial, newcomer
status, and age diversity, as well as a diversity of trans identities. The CET
served as an alternative set of eyes and voices from the community, and functioned
as `seeds' (that is, as the first people to complete the survey) in the respondent-
driven sampling data collection strategy. Overall, having the CET as the public face
and voice of the project during the data collection part of the survey stage, helped
to communicate the importance of community involvement and control in Trans
PULSE to the broader trans community. The CET was a crucial component of
Trans PULSE. It balanced our intention to engage a diverse array of trans com-
munities in Ontario with the pragmatic limitations of doing research. Bringing
people from across a province as large as Ontario together for regular meetings
and ongoing time-consuming work was difficult and expensive; the limited com-
mitment expected of CET members allowed for important contributions from
people who may not be able to make the commitment to the more intensive
involvement required of IC membership.
Travers et al. 409
Survey promotion
The project's Community Development Coordinator, as well as trans IC and CET
members, led the promotion of the survey. Given that respondent-driven sampling
(RDS) had not been previously used in trans communities, IC members developed
recruitment strategies both prior to initiation of the survey, and during recruitment
when strategy adaptation appeared to be necessary. In fact, the creation of the CET
itself was a strategy to attempt to engender greater trust and community `buy-in' so
that participants would both complete the lengthy survey and feel motivated to
recruit other participants, as was necessary given the methodology we selected.
CET members independently held information sessions in their communities, and
developed a promotional video (available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?
v¼bqbVw4Vzpi4). A Facebook group further aided project promotion and recruit-
ment. In-person and teleconference meetings were held with community leaders
from communities throughout Ontario. A toll-free phone line allowed any commu-
nity member to reach us with questions or comments. The success of our survey
recruitment strategy ­ especially given the length of the survey ­ was due to con-
tinued contact with community members, and promotion by community members.
Knowledge transfer and community accountability
Trans PULSE team members see ourselves, first and foremost, as being accountable
to trans people in Ontario. We regard ourselves as `stewards of lived experience',
who have an ethical obligation to return research findings to trans community and to
decision-makers who are able to implement change. As such, we have presented at
numerous conferences, released a number of e-bulletins and targeted reports high-
lighting key data (e.g. statistics on suicide and violence rates, key demographics, and
rates of employment and discrimination), used data in numerous workshop presen-
tations, and published papers in peer-reviewed journals.
Data collection using the Trans PULSE survey tool took place between May
2009 and May 2010. During this time 433 participants completed an 87-page survey
addressing the most comprehensive list of health, mental health, and quality of life
issues measured with trans people to date in Canada. Analysis and knowledge
translation and exchange are underway, and will continue for several years. We
consider these remarkable accomplishments that can be directly attributed to the
principles we have implemented and upheld since the project's inception.
Building community capacity
Community capacity-building has been prioritized in Trans PULSE as a means to
make positive change for trans communities. Capacity-building was prioritized
based on two factors: a desire for community members to have the opportunity
to learn to use more formal forms of knowledge production in their social action
research, and to ensure that when the project ended, tangible skills would be left
behind in the community to be put toward further research and social change.
410 Action Research 11(4)
Capacity-building has been integrated through ongoing activities designed to
enhance the capacities of the trans community to undertake research, including
qualitative data analysis training, survey development, and group writing. Team
members are also committed to more informal means of capacity-building on an
ongoing basis. Using the project's `knowledge to action' framework, formal
capacity-building initiatives have included an early research-to-policy think-tank,
and in 2012, a trans health advocacy summit. Both were designed to bring together
trans community leaders from throughout Ontario to develop our project in a policy-
relevant way, and to strategize around use of project results to maximize impact.
While our initial shared goal was to increase trans community capacity to under-
take research, and use research results to impact policy change, the project has also
resulted in capacity-building for the academic researchers involved, both with regard
to research methods and ability to work with trans communities. Moreover, to date,
more than a dozen Masters and PhD students from a number of disciplines have
contributed to Trans PULSE as part of formal graduate education requirements,
including three trans community members undertaking graduate studies. Additional
students, including trans graduate and undergraduate students, have contributed as
investigators, staff, and/or Community Engagement Team members. Through these
student mentorships, Trans PULSE has contributed to the development of a new
generation of health and social science researchers who have skills and experience in
CBPR, in addition to being knowledgeable about trans issues.
Reflections on Trans PULSE: Lessons learned
As a CBPR project, Trans PULSE is highly unique and innovative. Despite the
considerable success Trans PULSE has had in implementing these guiding prin-
ciples to date, in building capacities, and in creating a project that prioritizes `com-
munity control', several challenges have emerged throughout the project. We
believe that these are important to share, in terms of advancing CBPR theory
and knowledge. These challenges and questions were first drafted by two of the
project's investigators (one trans and one cisgender) and were refined and revised
by the other authors on this article (who constitute a trans majority). We present
these challenges first as issues and then as `questions' for other CBPR stakeholders
in the field to reflect upon in their own research projects.
Challenge 1: Power differences in academic/community partnerships
Knowledge and power are intertwined, and research projects are inextricably
linked to the power relationships outside their immediate context (e.g. academic
knowledge, in general, is held in higher regard than community knowledge).
Despite safeguards for ensuring equity, sharing power in CBPR projects presents
unique challenges, requiring significant anticipation and planning. Despite the fact
that trans community members interviewed and chose their own academic partners
for the study, inevitable challenges have emerged with two cisgender academics
Travers et al. 411
serving as `co-principal investigators' at the helm of Trans PULSE. The power of
academics is enshrined in systems set up to support research, such as positions on
grants, administration of funds, the complexities of research ethics boards, and the
need to publish in academic journals. All of these require or promote academic
leadership of projects and establish academics as experts in areas that are not
typically their own lived experience. Thus, even if a project defines its power struc-
ture differently, on paper and in processes, academics must often be the formal
project leaders. Though community members do have power in the research pro-
cess (for example, the power to affect community support and give a project legit-
imacy), this power remains outside established systems. Moreover, funding bodies
force inherent power imbalances in CBPR by forcing research teams to choose
whether community members will be staff members or investigators: staff members
are financially compensated for their time but tend to lack influence over project
direction, while investigators have greater decision-making power, but are typically
not financially compensated. Only two of our seven community investigators have
paid work time allocated to the project by their employers. Consequently, they
have had more time available while others have had to forgo potential paid time on
other activities to contribute to the project.
Our attempt to mediate these power imbalances has been through our Terms of
Reference, through trans people forming the majority of the investigators, and also
through capacity-building, where numerous opportunities have been available to
write and present, to receive training about technical research skills, to be able to
engage in conversations about research, to design survey tools, to conduct focus
groups, analyze results, and communicate those results effectively.
Notwithstanding the Terms of Reference contract, and despite the fact that trans
community investigators have had a high level of trust for the project's two aca-
demic researchers, there were no processes put in place for acknowledging and
addressing the considerable power differences, were this to become a problem.
Instead, power-related discussions sometimes emerged in forums where it was
rushed, or where it was off topic (and would have usurped more immediate
agenda items). We have tried to acknowledge differentials in paid allocated employ-
ment time to the grant with a small ($125/month) honorarium for investigators
who do not have research included as part of their paid job descriptions, but this
does not fully compensate for the work undertaken.
Question 1: How do we better attend to, identify, and address issues of power in
academic-community partnerships?
Challenge 2: Unintentional disempowerment during technical stages
of research
Issues of power imbalance become particularly challenging during research stages
that are necessarily driven by academic expertise (e.g. proposal development, ethics
412 Action Research 11(4)
review, data analysis). These phases sometimes take longer than expected, and
during these periods of time, other community researchers may not feel that
their contributions are as valuable (and especially if they are not able or willing
to voice these concerns). As CBPR continues to advance in popularity and impact,
it is important for teams to ensure that the development and implementation of
`technical' stages of a research project are meaningful for all team members. The
RDS method used in this project required a high level of technical expertise at
times, and during those times there was a noticeable withdrawal of some commu-
nity investigators who found it hard to contribute to those discussions and hard to
conceive of their roles. The vast majority of Trans PULSE community investiga-
tors were drawn to the project's social action model and came with backgrounds as
activists and service providers. When team members did have research experience,
it was often qualitative, rather than quantitative, and did not prepare them to
understand the complex RDS method used in this project. During our lengthy
survey development phase, project discourse shifted significantly in nature from
`social justice and community action and development' to `question development,
reliability, validity, standardized scales, and variables'. Unfortunately, as the work
of the team became more `scientifically sophisticated', some community investiga-
tors began to quietly question their roles and their ability to make meaningful
contributions to this phase. The team, however, was facing considerable time pres-
sures and did not always pick up on these cues. In our experience, the gap between
existing community knowledge versus the technical needs of the research, can
lessen the ability of community members to exercise control over the research
process.
Question 2: How can we design community roles where all people on a team can really
contribute their strengths? How can we ensure community members have the expertise
they need to lead?
Challenge 3: Unintentional disempowerment of community members
Another challenge experienced by Trans PULSE was the positioning of a trans
community leader in a paid employment position where he did not have the equiva-
lent voting power of investigators. On the one hand, a reasonable argument can be
made about the necessity of avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may occur
if a paid staff person has equal voice (and voting power) as an investigator. On the
other hand, when a community member's ability to vote is not granted, the team
and project may be unwisely (and unwittingly) suppressing `voice' and wisdom.
Traditional employment arrangements can put community members in positions
where they are there to `take orders and to execute them', diminishing the scope of
skills and breadth of knowledge they can fully bring to the project. Ironically,
CBPR teams often expect the investment of community members to be
larger than their (usually) part-time roles. This standard way of viewing an
Travers et al. 413
employer­employee relationship may serve to maintain the status quo by creating
hierarchical arrangements in a CBPR project, where those who should have power
according to CBPR principles (in this case, trans people), in reality have little.
Another issue related to unintentional disempowerment had to do with our
Community Engagement Team. Despite our best intentions of pulling together a
diverse Trans PULSE Community Engagement Team, like all CBPR teams, we were
faced with significant budgetary limitations. This resulted in our CET meeting in
person only once per year, for a total of two times, over the course of the initial three-
year project (they also engaged in some teleconference activities with our
Community Development Coordinator). Our intention in having a CET was to
show the broader trans communities that we were `serious' about community-
engagement and input. Their ability to work effectively, however, was severely lim-
ited by infrequent meetings, making it difficult for the CET to have truly meaningful
input into the project. Moreover, the CET largely comprised volunteers, receiving a
small monthly honorarium, which led to some uncertainty about how much impact
they could really have. We have found a potential contradiction in our expectation
that the CET `guides' the project from these under-resourced positions. Despite
these good intentions, and despite the CET's success in shaping the survey, designing
and producing a promotional video, and conducting workshops in their commu-
nities, this dynamic was quite disempowering for many of the CET members who felt
that the real power in Trans PULSE resided in the project's Investigators Team.
Another issue emerged in relation to some community members feeling excluded
from participating in the survey. The parameters of respondent-driven sampling
meant that trans people had to wait to be invited by another trans person to fill out
the survey (after a long period of advertising and promotion, accompanied by
increasing community excitement and enthusiasm about the survey). This seems
to have touched a sore spot for some people around `popularity' or `belonging' in
the community. Some asked `do I have to be part of the in-crowd to complete the
survey'?
Question 3: How do we find alternative ways of conceptualizing power and ensuring
that community members who end up in staff roles in CBPR projects have power?
How can we design, fund, and empower steering committees that are not symbolic but
are able to truly steer? What are our responsibilities when it comes to the uninten-
tional impacts of a CBPR project?
Challenge 4: Community trauma and team dynamics
`Horizontal hostility' can be a major factor within marginalized communities,
where people who have been very damaged by trauma and exclusion enact similar
patterns on one another. Some have described this tendency for power to be turned
inwards in community organizations as `eating our own' (Cain, 2002). There have
been occasions in Trans PULSE where conflict has occurred between team
414 Action Research 11(4)
members, and where there has been disagreement about the cause or source of the
conflict. Some team members have regarded the conflict as `between individuals'
(i.e. as interpersonal) whereas others have explained it vis-a
` -vis the framework of
horizontal hostility. While our Terms of Reference addressed strategies and guide-
lines for making decisions, it did not originally state explicitly how we would deal
with conflict, though it now identifies a series of steps to address this. Moreover,
effective means of communicating about these conflicts were not always imple-
mented, and instances where conflict was addressed were not always successful.
When conflicts are left unmanaged, however, a team fails to address how they
might be impacting the work of the team and the project in general. As such,
unaddressed conflict has the potential to create rifts among and between team
members, to demoralize them, and to even cause some people to leave a project.
Our team came to realize that our deep and shared sense of the importance of the
project was, in fact, part of what was causing us to be conflict-avoidant in order to
avoid disrupting the project. We had to reconceptualize addressing conflict as some-
thing that was about ensuring the survival of the project, rather than threatening it.
Question 4: What can CBPR teams put in place to minimize horizontal hostility
among team members from marginalized communities? What can we put in place
to address potential conflicts before they occur, or as soon as possible after?
Challenge 5: The reproduction of systemic inequities on CBPR teams
One of the key issues that Trans PULSE has struggled with is how to adequately
address the range of experiences facing diverse groups within trans communities.
At one point in the project, we started to get feedback from the trans community
about the lack of representation of racialized trans people on this project; this
feedback was entirely well-founded. Like other marginalized communities, those
trans people who have access to forms of privilege derived from race, class, etc.,
often have increased access to leadership positions as `community representatives'.
When a number of investigators who were members of racialized communities left
the team, overtime most of us accepted the individual reasons they provided for
leaving, without asking ourselves `is there a systemic problem here that is related to
anti-racism'? At the prompting of community members, our team responded to
these concerns by organizing an anti-racism training for project investigators and
another later on in conjunction with the Community Engagement Team, adding
anti-racism as a `standing item' on each meeting agenda, creating three new co-
investigator positions geared specifically towards trans members of racialized com-
munities, and eventually developing an anti-oppression/anti-racism statement for
the project. Despite taking these positive steps in action to community concerns, we
failed to proactively plan a broad and systematic anti-racism strategy for Trans
PULSE. Such a strategy might have included ongoing training, a well-articulated
plan for addressing race and diversity issues in our promotion, in our survey and
Travers et al. 415
knowledge translation phases, and implications for the composition of our team
(for example, a policy stating that a certain percentage of investigators would be
designated to trans members of racialized communities). What made this issue
particularly challenging were the differing levels of awareness among investigators
and Community Engagement Team members about the issues of oppression
beyond transphobia.
Question 5: What do we mean when we call our CBPR projects `anti-racist'? How do
we operationalize anti-racism?
Discussion
The imperative of values, voice and process
Trans PULSE strives to undertake high-quality research that fosters greater under-
standing about the health of trans people, and to make a real difference in trans
Ontarians' quality of life. Moreover, to help to redress power inequities, and build
the kind of trust between trans community members and researchers that would
result in a truly community-driven research agenda, we undertook a model of
research that centered community control and ownership. Stoeker (2012) maintains
that we do not `walk our talk' in CBPR and that `we may not have an effective talk
that can guide the walk of participatory and action-oriented research practice'
(p. 386). We believe, that in Trans PULSE, we did our best to `walk the talk' of
CBPR by engaging in strategies to ensure that community were in control of all
project phases. Moreover, in utilizing a Terms of Reference contract and regarding
it as a living/breathing document, and by shifting the discourse from community
engagement to control, we may actually have Arieli, Friedman, and Agbaria (2009)
moved one step closer to developing what Stoeker (2012) calls for, `talk that can
guide the walk of CBPR'.
In light of our considerable successes, we struggled with issues related to power
sharing between community and academic partners, unintentional disempower-
ment, horizontal hostility and differing ideas about how to approach anti-racism
work. A significant challenge emerged at many points in the process that had to do
with unintentional disempowerment of community members, including community
investigators, community engagement team members and staff. It was particularly
visible during the more technical stages of our research project, when some com-
munity voices were more noticeably absent in discussions. This flux in participation
was never discussed openly by the full team. Gaventa and Cornwall (2001, p. 184)
provide one explanation by arguing that the professional and technical nature of
some conversations are fused with power relations, and `. . . may serve to silence the
voices or ways of speaking of some groups while enabling those of others'.
Zakus and Lysack (1998) maintain that `community participation is a complex
and fragile process [and] there are many factors that operate to diminish its success'
(p. 6). Building upon this, Arieli et al. (2009) assert the need to `test the
416 Action Research 11(4)
assumptions' held by academic researchers, that community are willing and able to
participate as partners in all stages of a research project. Despite our best intentions
to create a model of community ownership, some community members may have
preferred the planning and action-oriented stages of research over those more
technical and academic in nature. Despite mutual respect between community
and academic team members, the research team did not have open conversations
about issues of power and voice on a regular basis. Ospina et al. (2004) maintains
`that a mutual inquiry space requires a very honest conversation about roles, tasks,
boundaries, authority, and power in the context of each particular project and as
relationships is being built' (p. 66). We are reminded that it is one thing to be aware
of privilege and still quite another to proactively work toward minimizing its dele-
terious effects. As Minkler (2005) states `. . . even outsiders who pride ourselves on
being trusted community friends and allies often fail to appreciate the extent of the
power that is embedded in our own, often multiple sources of privilege, and how it
can affect both process and outcomes in such research' (p. ii9).
CBPR has the potential to `transform the culture of silence among oppressed
groups' (Chavez, Duran, Baker, Avila, & Wallerstein, 2008, p. 97), however, that
potential is easily compromised when we fail to adequately examine disparities in
power and how they impact genuine participation. Over 40 years ago, Arnstein
(1969) made a compelling point when she argued `. . . that participation without
redistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless'
(p. 216). Maiter, Simich, Jacobson, and Wise (2008) speak to the importance of
reciprocity in research ­ creating room for dialogue, openness and trust building,
and the need to be explicit up front about the diverse needs of partners in a research
project. Similarly, Nelson, Pancer, Hayward, and Kelly (2004) maintain that the
values underlying partnerships are often neglected. They emphasize the importance
of developing a shared vision and identifying the strengths of group members in the
initial stages of partnership development. Trans PULSE has tried to address this by
getting members to know each other and to declare their stakes and interests in the
beginning and `putting them on the table', so to speak. What we have not done as
effectively is to create space for ongoing learning and reflection about the CBPR
principles that guide our work, how well (or not) we are adhering to them, and how
to resolve or unify the conflicts and contradictions that emerge in trying to reach
our multiple goals.
Straddling two worlds: Research `versus' community development
Despite operating under a model of `community control' and being guided by a clear
Terms of Reference contract, team members frequently experience a feeling of `push-
pull' on the ultimate goal of the project: data collection/knowledge production or
social justice work? As such, we may approach how we do our work according to
what we personally believe to be right based on a complicated mix of factors, includ-
ing our training, our taken-for-granted assumptions about the world, our `privilege',
our cumulative `lived experience', and our position in the world. Sometimes we have
Travers et al. 417
different stakes in a project, are held up to quite different standards, and are account-
able to different bodies. Community members are accountable to their communities
(and in some cases employers); they must be trustworthy, humble, attentive to com-
munity needs, and reflective of the diversity in that community. Academic research-
ers are held to academic standards of excellence, must publish quickly, must present
in academic contexts if seeking tenure, and must be first author on academic papers
in some cases. These different standards are inextricably linked to what Minkler
(2005) labeled as `differential reward structures for partners in CBPR' (p. ii9) pro-
jects, where academic researchers often stand to gain the most from such projects,
even if the major goal is to benefit the community at hand.
As a CBPR project, the goal of Trans PULSE is to produce the highest quality
data possible to inform longer-term health, mental health, systemic, and other
community-level changes. As a community development initiative, its goal is
rooted in social justice: Trans PULSE will mobilize knowledge and resources
and will empower people to make changes in their lives. A community development
framework and a research framework can potentially be viewed as competing
lenses for approaching the goals and work of Trans PULSE. In some instances,
they will complement one another, whereas in others, they may actively compete.
Jacobs (2010) maintains that at times like this `academic quality' may supersede the
need or desire to pay strict attention to moral or ethical concerns in research and in
CBPR. One very interesting dilemma that illustrates these two potentially contrast-
ing lenses focused on the needs of `isolated' trans people. Some of these individuals
contacted us during the survey administration phase indicating that they did not
know any other trans people and therefore would not be asked to complete our
survey. This resulted directly from our usage of the RDS method whereby indi-
viduals who complete the survey are given a set number of codes used to invite
other trans people to complete the survey. Thus, one has to 1) wait to be invited to
complete the survey, but 2) must know other trans people in order to be invited to
participate. While our team recognized in advance that this would be a socially
awkward methodology, we had engaged in extensive discussion and concluded that
the advantages in terms of validity of information gained ­ and consequently both
the increased protection of trans community from mis-information produced
through biased research and the increased potential for policy impact ­ outweighed
the awkwardness. However, in implementation, not only did the process involve
awkward messaging and social dynamics, but some trans people felt excluded from
the study. While we were able to ask some of those who contacted us to complete a
survey and start a new chain of recruits, there is no way of knowing who else was
missed as a result of the structure of this methodology.
Jacobs (2010) makes mention of such conundrums where anxieties about `aca-
demic quality' in research studies can risk potentially usurping moral and ethical
concerns. Our discussions as a team, however, focused on upholding the integrity
and rigor of the RDS method, while at the same time trying to figure out how to
include isolated individuals as participants. Many of us did not see our role,
418 Action Research 11(4)
however, as one where the survey could be used as a means of community develop-
ment or to connect people to others, as the method demanded that people recruit
through existing connections. Thus, through a research lens, their dilemma (isola-
tion) was usurped by concerns with the study methodology. Through a social justice
lens, however, it could be seen as unacceptable to potentially contribute to the fur-
ther isolation of those individuals ­ a reversion of sorts where isolated people are
regarded as `subjects' without an `absolute right' to participate in research about
`their' communities. We thought that we might be excluding people from a study
about `social exclusion' and raised this as an ethical question ­ `are we unintention-
ally hurting people here vis-a
` -vis our chosen method'? Could the production of what
may be more `ethical' knowledge (less biased, with greater potential impact) ever
justify potential harm to community members through exclusion, or should the
methods be compromised to preserve the aims of community development?
Conclusion
Historically, significant harm has been done by researchers who have pathologized
trans communities, positioning themselves as `experts' about transgender people,
prioritizing their own career motives, and offering very little in return (Bauer et al.,
2009; Namaste, 2000). In line with CBPR's aim to avoid errors made by more trad-
itional approaches to research, Trans PULSE has been successful in implementing a
model of `community control' over time, though problems and challenges have
occurred. We have learned as a team that there is a need to continually balance
priorities and address privilege and inequities. In future phases, we are learning to
set processes in place for conflict resolution in advance, and to set out roles for com-
munity members that are well conceived and actually engage their strengths. We will
build in time for reflection and learning on an ongoing basis and will continue to
evaluate how we live up to the CBPR principles we have chosen to guide our work.

Notes
1. Trans is an umbrella term that encompasses a diverse group of people whose gender
identity or expression diverts from prevailing societal expectations for individuals of the
sex they were assigned at birth. Trans includes transsexual, transitioned, transgender, and
genderqueer people, as well as some two-spirit people. The corresponding terms cissexual
and cisgender typically describe nontrans people.
2. Trans PULSE has received funding from The Wellesley Institute, The Ontario HIV
Treatment Network and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Institute of
Infection and Immunity, and Institute of Gender and Health).
