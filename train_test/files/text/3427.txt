Abstract
Objective: We planned a cross-sectional analysis to determine the frequency and severity of
metabolic acidosis in patients taking topiramate while awaiting craniotomy.
Methods: Eighty patients (18 ­ 65 years) taking topiramate to control seizures while awaiting
elective craniotomy were enrolled. Any signs of metabolic acidosis or topiramate-related side
effects were investigated. Blood chemistry levels and arterial blood gases, including lactate, were
obtained. The severity of metabolic acidosis was defined according to base excess levels as mild or
moderate.
Results: Blood gas analysis showed that 71% (n ¼ 57) of patients had metabolic acidosis. The
frequency of moderate metabolic acidosis was 56% (n ¼ 45), while that of mild metabolic acidosis
was 15% (n ¼ 12). A high respiratory rate was reported in only 10% of moderately acidotic
patients.
Conclusions: In patients receiving topiramate, baseline blood gas analysis should be performed
preoperatively to determine the presence and severity of metabolic acidosis.

Introduction
Topiramate has been a welcome develop-
ment for treating patients with refractory
epilepsy and has also been proven effective
and safe in clinical trials for treating patients
with partial seizures.1 Since then, it has been
widely administered to neurosurgical
patients, and its clinical use is likely to
expand. Thus, anaesthesiologists are
increasingly likely to encounter patients

receiving topiramate therapy during pre-
operative evaluations.
Metabolic acidosis is a known infrequent
adverse reaction to topiramate therapy.2,3
Often, topiramate-related acidosis is asymp-
tomatic, but marked decreases can be
expected to occur when patients receiving
topiramate undergo surgery.4 Craniotomy
increases the risk of fluid shift, and therefore
requires more anaesthetic drugs for the
lengthy surgery.5 These factors can in turn
increase pre-existing metabolic acidosis. For
that reason, in patients taking topiramate
and undergoing craniotomy, documenting
the metabolic status is important.
Despite the importance of this effect of
topiramate on metabolic status, topiramate-
related metabolic acidosis has been reported
in few adult patients, and there are only
limited prospective studies in the litera-
ture.6­10 Only one of these studies is in
neurosurgical patients, and it retrospectively
reported the results of blood gas analysis in
six patients.10 Therefore, we designed this
prospective cross-sectional analysis to deter-
mine the frequency and severity of metabolic
acidosis, determined through blood gas
analysis, in patients taking topiramate who
were being prepared for elective craniotomy.
Patients and methods
We enrolled 80 patients (age range: 18­65
years) who were taking topiramate and
planning to undergo elective craniotomy.
All patients gave written informed consent,
and the study was approved by the institu-
tional ethics committee.
We excluded patients with diabetes melli-
tus, diabetes insipidus, or hepatic or renal
disease, and any patient taking other medi-
cations likely to cause metabolic acidosis.
The demographic data for each patient were
recorded, and any signs of metabolic acid-
osis or topiramate-related side effects were
investigated (e.g., dizziness, drowsiness,
headache, somnolence, memory problems,
or paraesthesia). Each patient's respiratory
rate was measured at rest and recorded. A
high respiratory rate was described as more
than 20 breaths per minute at rest. The
results of routine blood chemistry tests were
also recorded. These included liver and renal
function tests, total protein, albumin, elec-
trolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, mag-
nesium, and calcium), serum osmolality,
haemoglobin. Urine analysis results were
also recorded. Baseline arterial blood gas
levels, including lactate, were obtained at the
time of admission (Roche OMNI S,
Mannheim, Germany). The severity of
metabolic acidosis was defined according
to base excess (BE) levels: a BE from À3 to
À5 indicated mild acidosis, a BE from À5 to
À10 indicated moderate acidosis, and a BE
level below À10 indicated severe acidosis.
Patients on topiramate with moderate
acidosis were switched to another anti-
epileptic drug. If the acidosis resolved
within 2 ­ 4 days of discontinuing topir-
amate therapy, patients were scheduled for
surgery. If the acidosis did not resolve, the
BE was replaced with bicarbonate therapy.
Severely acidotic patients with clinical symp-
toms were treated with bicarbonate.
SPSS for Windows version 16.0 was used
for statistical analysis, and the results were
expressed as the mean Æ standard deviation
(SD). All variables were tested for normal
distribution using the Shapiro­Wilk test.
Correlations between the variables were
analyzed with Spearman's rho correlation
test and one-way analysis of variance. A
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

mate dosages, concomitant antiepileptic
therapies, topiramate-related side effects,

(n ¼ 57) of patients. Moderate metabolic
acidosis was observed in 56% (n ¼ 45) of
patients, while mild metabolic acidosis was
seen in 15% (n ¼ 12).
Mean arterial blood gas values were
reported as pH: 7.34Æ 5, carbon dioxide par-
tial pressure (PaCO2
): 29Æ 5mmHg, bicar-
bonate (HCO3
À): 18Æ 2mmol.LÀ1, BE:
À6.3Æ 2mmol.LÀ1, chloride (ClÀ): 111Æ
3mmol.LÀ1, and lactate: 0.9Æ0.2mmol.LÀ1;
furthermore, serum potassium was 3.4Æ 2.1
mEg.LÀ1 and urinary pH was 4.0Æ 1.3 in
patients with metabolic acidosis (n¼ 57).
Ten percent of patients with metabolic
acidosis had a high respiratory rate.
Headache (n ¼ 14), sleepiness (n ¼ 25), diz-
ziness (n ¼ 6), and paraesthesia (n ¼ 3) were
topiramate-related side effects observed in
patients. There was no correlation between
the frequency of these side effects and the
severity of metabolic acidosis (p > 0.05), or
between the duration of topiramate use and
the severity of metabolic acidosis (p > 0.05).
For patients with moderate acidosis
(n ¼ 45), topiramate therapy was discontin-
ued and the side effects resolved in 2­4 days.
Discussion
In this study, the frequency of topiramate-
related metabolic acidosis was 71%.
Among these patients with metabolic acid-
osis, 56% had moderate acidosis that
resolved 2­4 days after the discontinuation
of topiramate therapy.
Metabolic acidosis is a life-threatening
complication of the perioperative period.5

It can cause decreased cardiac output, elec-
trolyte imbalance, surgical bleeding, and
neurological complications, even coma and
death, in surgical patients.11 Neurosurgical
patients have a potentially higher risk of
acidosis than patients undergoing other sur-
geries because of the longer duration of
surgery, greater risk of fluid shift, and
increased requirements for anaesthetic drugs.
Thus, documenting a patient's metabolic
status before surgery is critical in this group.
The 71% frequency of topiramate-related
metabolic acidosis that we observed is a high
percentage for surgical patients. Patients with
mild acidosis present no symptoms, however,
and this absence of relevant clinical symptoms
renders it more difficult to recognize the
problem without blood gas analysis.
In a systematic review of topiramate use,
Dell'Orto and colleagues concluded that
topiramate is associated with mild to mod-
erate hypochloraemic metabolic acidosis.12
Topiramate can weakly inhibit carbonic
anhydrase, which may lead to hypochlor-
aemic metabolic acidosis, most likely from
renal tubular acidosis rather than from a
more central mechanism.9,12 Only three
studies (with small sample numbers) and a
few case reports have documented the fre-
quency of topiramate-related metabolic side
effects (maximum 55 patients) to date.9,10
Despite the many reports describing the
phenomenon in paediatric patients, the lit-
erature includes only one report of meta-
bolic acidosis related to topiramate therapy
in adult neurosurgical patients.10 That study
included only six blood samples after the
induction of anesthesia.10 The authors retro-
spectively reported that metabolic acidosis
occurred in 60% of patients taking topir-
amate in their case series. However, they
collected the data retrospectively, after
anaesthesia, and their series is a small
sample size. They recommend that patients
who take topiramate should be asked about
symptoms during the preoperative evalu-
ation and that blood gas analysis should be
routinely performed before patients undergo
surgical procedures.10 To date, our series is
the largest to document metabolic disturb-
ances related to topiramate in a surgical
population.6­10
Although increased respiratory rate is a
sign of acidosis, it appears only in patients
with moderate to severe acidosis and cannot
be detected easily. There are different
reports of the time required for serum
carbon dioxide levels to return to normal
after topiramate is discontinued.9 In our
series, 10% of patients had increased respir-
ation and blood gases normalized in 2­4
days in most patients after topiramate was
discontinued, a finding that reflects those
reported in the literature.9
In conclusion, the results of this prospect-
ive study suggest that, in patients receiving
topiramate, preoperative evaluation should
include the consideration of metabolic acid-
osis. Baseline blood gas levels can be
obtained to confirm the presence and sever-
ity of metabolic acidosis.
