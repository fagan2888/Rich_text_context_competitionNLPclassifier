Introduction
Angiotensin II plays an important role in regulating blood
pressure by stimulating angiotensin II receptors, and its
stimulation also augments oxidative stress, resulting in
vascular dysfunction. Therefore, angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
blockers (ARBs) may be more useful for preventing vas-
cular dysfunction than other hypotensive drugs. However,
a more important effect for patients with hypertension has
been shown to be the production of a lower blood pressure
that is stable for 24 h after administration of medication in
the clinic.1,2
In general, drug efficacy is thought to be related to plasma
drug concentration. However, the hypotensive effect ofACE
inhibitors may be dependent on the vascular ACE inhibitory
effect rather than on the plasma effect.3,4 A significant
correlation between vascularACE activity and systolic blood
pressure (SBP) was observed after administration of ACE
inhibitors in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), but no cor-
relation was seen between plasma ACE activity and SBP.4

Abstract
Introduction: To clarify the importance of the vascular concentration of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to its
hypotensive effect, the relationships between the drug concentrations in plasma and vascular tissues and the hypotensive
effect after administration of an ARB were compared.
Materials and methods: In spontaneously hypertensive/NDmcr-cp rats (SHR/NDmcr-cp), systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction were measured 2 h and 24 h after administration of telmisartan
(3 mg/kg). Plasma and vascular concentrations of telmisartan were also measured at 2 h and 24 h.
Results: SBP was significantly lower 2 h after administration of telmisartan, and the significant hypotensive effect was
continued until 24 h. A significant attenuation of angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction at 2 h was also continued
until 24 h. No significant difference between 2 h and 24 h was observed both in SBP and angiotensin II-induced vascular
contraction. Vascular concentration at 24 h was 90.0% when the concentration at 2 h was assumed to be 100%, and no
significant difference was observed. However, the plasma concentration of telmisartan at 2 h was significantly decreased
by 88.2% at 24 h.
Conclusion: The vascular drug concentration, not the plasma drug concentration, may be related to the hypotensive
effect after administration of telmisartan.

the hypotensive effect has been unclear, because measure-
ment of drug concentrations in vascular tissues has been dif-
ficult.Recently,wesucceededinmeasuringtheconcentration
ofARB in plasma and vascular tissues using a novel method,
matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and imaging mass
spectrometry (IMS) in the selected reaction monitoring
(SRM) mode.5 In the present study, to clarify the importance
of the vascular concentration of an ARB on the hypotensive
effect, the hypotensive effect, angiotensin II-induced vascu-
lar contraction, and drug concentrations in plasma and vas-
cular tissue after administration were measured.
Materials and methods
Animals
Ten-week-oldmalespontaneouslyhypertensive/NDmcr-cp
rats (SHR/NDmcr-cp) were obtained from Japan SLC Inc.
(Shizuoka, Japan). All procedures complied with the
guidelines on animal care of the local Ethics Committee on
the Use ofAnimals (protocol number 8815, Shiga Research
Center, Nissei BILIS, Koka, Japan).
Each rat was orally administered 3 mg/kg of telmisar-
tan. SBP was monitored by tail-cuff plethysmography
(BP-2000, Visitech Systems, Apex, NC, USA) 2 h and 24
h after oral drug administration, and the rats were then
anesthetized with isoflurane to obtain blood and vascular
tissues.
Vascular responses in the isolated artery
Isolated rat carotid arteries were cut into 10 mm × 1.0 mm
helical strips and placed on a myograph under a resting
tension of 1.0 g in Tyrode's solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.7
mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2
, 1.1 mM MgCl2
, 0.42 mM
NaH2
PO4
, 12 mM NaHCO3
, and 5.7 mM glucose, pH 7.4)
at 37°C and continuously bubbled with 5% CO2
in O2
. The
strips were initially vasoconstricted with 50 mM KCl, and
the response of each strip served as the reference for angi-
otensin II (30 µM)-induced contraction of the correspond-
ing strip.
MALDI-TOFMS and MALDI-IMS analyses
To measure plasma drug concentration, a MALDI matrix
consisting of 7 mg/mL of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was directly
mixed with plasma, and the mixture was placed on a
MALDI plate (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA).5
To measure vascular drug concentration, aortic tissue
was frozen in TissueTechTM (Sakura Fineteck, Osaka), and
each block was sectioned at a thickness of 12 µm.6 The
sections were mounted on indium-tin-oxide-coated glass
slides (Bruker Daltonics), and then -CHCA matrix was
coated onto the sections.
The concentration of telmisartan in plasma and vascular
slices was quantified using MALDI-TOFMS and -IMS in
the SRM mode on an Autoflex Speed TOFMS (Bruker
Daltonics) equipped with a SmartbeamTM-II solid-state
laser (wavelength, 355 nm; focused diameter, 20 m; rep-
etition rate, 500 Hz).5 Telmisartan detected by MALDI-
TOFMS and -IMS in the SRM mode is all active form, and
its metabolites did not be detected.
With respect to the precision of measuring telmisartan in
plasma (n = 8), the variability of results was 5.8%, and the
accuracy values ranged between from -11.0% to -3.7%.
The limit of telmisartan measurement in plasma by
MALDI-TOFMS in the SRM mode was 2.0 nM. The preci-
sion for the measurement of telmisartan in sliced aorta was
evaluated using dropped telmisartan on a glass slide (n = 8).
The variability of results was 4.6%, and the accuracy val-
ues ranged from -2.3% to 9.2%. The limit of telmisartan
measurement in sliced aorta by MALDI-IMS in the SRM
mode was 0.2 pmol/mm2.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). The significance of differences between mean val-
ues for multiple groups was evaluated using one-way anal-
ysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. Differences
were considered significant at a p value < 0.05.
Results
SBP and angiotensin II-induced vascular
contraction
SBP was significantly lower at 2 h than at pre-treatment,
and a significant lowering effect was also observed at 24 h
(Figure 1(a)). There was no significant difference between
2 h and 24 h (Figure 1(a)).
Angiotensin II-induced vascular contractions were
attenuated by 94.6% and 90.6% at 2 h and 24 h, respec-
tively, when the contraction before administration of tel-
misartan was assumed to be 100% (Figure 1(b)). No
significant difference was also observed between 2 h and
24 h (Figure 1(b)).
Plasma and vascular concentrations of
telmisartan
Plasma concentrations of telmisartan were 0.34 ± 0.04 µM
and 0.04 ± 0.01 µM 2 h and 24 h after oral administration,
respectively, and the difference was significant (Figure 2(a)).
Vascular concentrations of telmisartan were 2.82 ± 0.39
pmol/mm2 and 2.54 ± 0.33 pmol/mm2 at 2 h and 24 h after
oral administration, respectively (Figure 2(b)). Although
the vascular concentration of telmisartan tended to be lower
from 2 h to 24 h, no significant difference was observed.

Discussion
In general, higher lipophilic drugs including ACE inhibi-
tors may be more likely to remain in tissues for the long-
term.3,4 Both vascular ACE inhibition and a hypotensive
effect were observed until several days after administra-
tion of a high-lipophilic ACE inhibitor (trandolapril).3
Significant vascular ACE inhibition continued until 24 h
after administration in SHR treated with the high-lipo-
philic ACE inhibitors trandolapril and perindopril, but not
with the low-lipophilic ACE inhibitors enalapril and
temocapril, although these ACE inhibitors inhibited vascu-
lar ACE activity equally 3 h after administration.4 Like
ACE inhibitors, ARBs also shows various lipophilicities.
The lipophilicity index is defined as the ratio of octanol to
buffer, and the values of log p are: -2.45 with EXP 3174
(an active metabolite of losartan); -0.96 with candesartan;
-0.95 with valsartan; +1.48 with irbesartan; and +3.20
with telmisartan.6 Among ARBs, telmisartan has been well
known to show a high-lipophilic character, and telmisartan
was used to clarify the importance of the vascular concen-
tration of ARBs on the hypotensive effect.
In the present study, telmisartan showed a significant
hypotensive effect 2 h after administration, and the hypoten-
sive effect was observed until 24 h. The significant attenua-
tion of angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction seen at
2 h after administration was also observed until 24 h. These
findings suggest that blockade of angiotensin II receptors
was continued until 24 h after administration, and the con-
tinuous vascular blockade resulted in lower SBP. In fact,
90% of the vascular telmisartan concentration detected 2 h
after administration was maintained until 24 h. On the other
hand, plasma telmisartan concentration was decreased by
87.4% from 2 h to 24 h. Thus, continuous attenuations of
SBP and angiotensin II-induced vascular contraction until
24 h after administration may be dependent on the mainte-
nance of vascular telmisartan concentration, but not plasma
telmisartan concentration.
As a limitation, the data shown in Figure 2(b) may
include the non-specific bound drug to tissue; the ratio of
drug bound specifically to angiotensin II receptors to that
bound non-specifically in vascular tissues is not known.
Although different ratios of specific to non-specific bind-
ing are observed among different drugs, the tissue drug
concentration is thought to reflect the pharmacological
effect using the same drug. In the present study, the high
maintenance of vascular drug concentration at 24 h com-
pared with that at 2 h may reflect the long-term pharmaco-
logical effect.
In the clinical setting, it is very difficult to use vascu-
lar drug concentration as a biomarker for the hypotensive
effect of ARBs. However, the importance of vascular
drug concentration demonstrated in the present study
may help us understand the mechanism of the hypoten-
sive effect of ARBs and to develop long-acting pharma-
cotherapy. Drugs need to maintain a stable hypotensive
effect for 24 h after their administration in the clinic, and
evaluation of vascular drug concentration may be useful
for the development of long-acting antihypertensive
drugs, including ARBs.
Conclusions
In general, plasma drug concentration has been thought to
be important for drug efficacy, but vascular drug concentra-
tion may be more important in reflecting the hypotensive
effect when using high-lipophilic drugs such as telmisartan.
