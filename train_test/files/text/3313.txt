An Approach to the Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT)
Services Industry
The ICT service industry encompasses both telecommunica-
tion services (NACE 64) and software services (NACE 72)
being characterized for high and intensive use of knowledge
and technology, what makes that some authors such as Miles
et al. (1995) refer to them as knowledge-intensive business
sectors, sharing this classification with other specialized ser-
vices sectors such as engineering, business consultancy, and
research and development (R&D) services.
Businesses in the ICT services industries face a high com-
petitive environment, because ICT industry is characterized
by high rates of technological change and innovation, and
new value chain and business models. At the same time, ICT
industry is extremely globalized and dynamic and is highly
concentrated in specific areas (García Manjón, 2008).
According to Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (OECD; 2015), the ICT sector is characterized
by continued high R&D expenditures and a large number of
ICT-related patents which reflect the key role of the ICT sec-
tor in innovation activities, resulting in an R&D business
expenditure accounting for almost 0.5% of GDP. Working in
such a highly demanding environment represents a challenge
for all ICT businesses, especially SMEs.
Being aware of the aforementioned, we consider innova-
tion as a key issue for business strategy, because it is expected
that it triggers competitiveness and firm performance. Thus,
scientific literature postulates that innovation represents a
significant factor in determining firm's success (Pratali,
2003; Ramadani, Gërguri, Rexhepi, & Abduli, 2013; Tse,
Esposito, & Soufani, 2016) while others (Wilkinson &
Thomas, 2014) alert that firms that do not innovate face
underperformance or dissolution.
García-Manjón and Romero-Merino (2012) stated that
"given the greater knowledge-intensity presented by these sec-
tors in comparison with nontechnological or medium-tech
sectors, it is reasonable to expect strong correlations between
R&D (knowledge creation) and firm growth." (p. 1085) Chan,
Martin, and Kensinger (1990) and Zantout and Tsetsekos
(1994) found a positive market response to increased R&D
investment for high-tech industry firms, while the relation-
ship turns out to be negative for low-tech industry firms.
Accordingly, there are many authors who posit a positive

Accelerating Innovation in Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises in the ICT
Services Sector
Juan Vicente García Manjón1, Rafael Mompó2,
and Judith Redoli3
Abstract
This work is aimed at establishing key organizational strategies that push small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the
information and communication technologies (ICT) services sector to be more innovative. Following an input and output
approach, a theoretical model is built that helps determine such key factors. Then the model is validated with fieldwork
carried out on a representative sample in Castile-Leon region (Spain). According to this model, the decision to innovate (and
the trigger for research and development [R&D] activities in SMEs in the ICT services sector) is the result of needs that are
presented by customers (public or private sector) in tailored projects. All the same, the factors leading to innovation are in
order of importance, the technological level of the company, the effort made by the company in R&D, and finally, systems
of incentives.

relationship between innovation and firm performance
(Bowen et al., 2010; Damanpour et al., 2009; Sok & O'Cass,
2011; Subramanian & Nilakanta, 1996). Price et al. (2013)
noted that "firms that engage in developing innovative prod-
ucts and services are positioned to compete more successfully
through the development of new products and processes,
before competitors in first-mover advantage, increasing mar-
ket share, return on investment (ROI), and overall firm suc-
cess" (p. 1). Finally, Coad and Rao (2008) also studied the
effects of innovation on firm growth in high-tech sectors
(including computers and office equipment, electronics, medi-
cal instruments, and drugs); their results vary within the differ-
ent sectors analyzed, but they generally find that growth is
related to innovativeness for most firms.
Innovation Patterns in Intensive
Knowledge and Tech SMEs
ICT service industries show two singular characteristics; on
one hand, they belong to the service sector; on the other
hand, they are technology and knowledge based sectors. So,
it is expected that the innovation patterns in these sectors
vary from other industrial or low-tech sectors. For instance,
some authors report significant differences between the
effect of R&D investment in the manufacturing sector, which
contributes more positively to firm market value than in the
service sector (Ehie & Olibe, 2010). Another difference
between innovation in industrial and service sectors is the
proper definition of innovation. Thus, it is worth posing a
definition of service innovation as "an offering not previ-
ously available to a firm's customers resulting from the addi-
tion of a service offering or changes in the service concept
that allow for the service offering to be made available"
(Menor, Tatikonda, & Sampson, 2002, p. 138).
Following with the description of service innovation, we
can lean on the taxonomy of innovation (Pavitt, 1984) who
distinguished among scale intensive, supplier dominated,
specialized equipment suppliers and science-based firms. The
latter category (science-based firms) is the one that better
defines ICT service industries. The author stated that the main
sources of technology for science-based firms are the R&D
activities of firms while they appropriate their innovating
leads through a mix of methods (i.e., patents, secrecy, natural
technical lags, and firm-specific skills). It is also worth citing
Den Hertog (2000), who studied the special features of inno-
vation in services, proposing five types: supplier dominated
innovation, innovation in services, client-led innovation,
innovation through services, and paradigmatic innovation.
The author affirmed that software firms, for instance, have to
adapt their activities to new products from hardware compa-
nies and it involves near continual updating and expansion of
software to exploit the facilities of new equipment. At the
same time, ICT is an important input for innovation in other
sectors, because the implementation of ICT-based solutions
is an innovation process or product itself. It is likely that
"client-led innovation" and "innovation through services" are
dominant types of innovation in these sectors.
More specifically, De Jong, Bruins, Dolfsma, and
Meijgaard (2003) studied the innovation in specialized ser-
vice sectors. The authors found out that innovation is heavily
dependent on the knowledge and skills of coworkers, being
the innovative activities of the service firms themselves the
main source of innovation, oriented to fit the specific cus-
tomer needs and developing this work in close interaction
with clients. Besides, these firms operate in a business-to-
business environment, having only a few customers with
relatively long client contact times, making considerable
adjustments in their services to meet customer needs.
However, some authors, such as Miles (2008), indicated
that some service organizations behave very much like high-
technology manufacturing, being this especially true in tech-
nology-based, knowledge-intensive business services. The
author states that there are "instinctive innovation patterns
displayed by knowledge intensive business services are
based more on professional knowledge and by large net-
work-based service firms, while many smaller service firms
conform to a supplier-driven pattern" (p. 115) and he adds
"project management and on-the-job innovation are common
ways of organizing service innovation." (p. 115)
Once we have shed light on the patterns of innovation in
service sector and specialized services sector, we want to
cope with another relevant point to our research, which is the
size of the businesses. Because we focus on small and
medium-sized businesses in the ICT service industry, we
would like to deep into the innovation patterns of SMEs.
According to Yin and Zuscovitch (1998), innovative behav-
ior in small companies faces different kinds of problems than
in other organizations. Harris, Rogers, and Siouclis (2001)
found that large companies are more innovative than SMEs.
Malerba (1993) stated that
the innovative process in SMEs is in general not the result of
formal R&D activities carried out at specific laboratories, but of
informal accumulated learning that is manifested in the
development of skills that allow them to assimilate, adapt and
improve new technologies and adapt the company's production
better to specific market demands (p. 234).
Rothwell (1991) found that innovation activities of SMEs
are important determinants of these SMEs' successes, while
other authors like Storey (1994) posited that SMEs in all
industries do not innovate. According to Tether and Storey
(1998), the impact of innovation on sales is an important
measure of innovativeness, but the impact in SMEs is lower
than in large companies.
Suh and Kim (2012) indicated that technology acquisition is
the most efficient type of collaboration for R&D of service
SMEs, while networking is not significantly related to any type
of R&D performance. Yeonhee, Sooyoung, and Hyejin (2011)
investigated whether R&D efforts influence the financial and
nonfinancial business performance of ICT business with a
García Manjón et al. 3
focus on SMEs in South Korea. The authors postulated positive
relationships between R&D efforts and a firm's performance.
As a contribution to broaden the approach to study this
problem, this article proposes to validate a theoretical model to
shed light on the innovation process of SMEs in the ICT ser-
vice industry. Thus, first a theoretical model is built, which is
then validated against a sample of ICT service industry SMEs
in Spain.
Model Development
Innovation Model
According to Ramadani, Abazi-Alili, Dana, Rexhepi, and
Ibraimi (2016), firm performance is usually measured by
indicators such as profit, revenue, growth, productivity, effi-
ciency, stock price, new markets, and export.
Innovation models try to represent innovation procedures
for a territory, sector, business, or group of particular busi-
nesses, including its relationships and behavior. However,
there is a major methodological challenge on how to measure
innovation behavior or technological change and its effect on
firm performance and at the same time getting appropriate
indicators or using proxies that reflect only some aspects of
the innovation process (Gërguri-Rashiti, Ramadani, Abazi-
Alili, Dana, & Ratten, 2015).
In this respect, Gërguri-Rashiti et al. (2015) posited that
the most common measures used in the literature analysing the
innovation process are as follows: (1) a measure of the inputs
into the innovation process, such as R&D expenditure or the
number of scientists and engineers; (2) a measure of output,
such as the number of inventions that have been patented; and
(3) a direct measure of innovation output, such as new products
or new processes (p. 5).
We have selected the conversion model (Crepon, Duguet,
& Mairesse, 1998) to establish our theoretical model. We con-
sider that innovation is a process that is driven by INPUTS or
contributions in the form of R&D, technology acquisition,
human or financial resources, that give rise to a series of
OUTPUTS or results of innovation in the form of product
innovations, process innovations or both. All this is based on
the application of a particular innovation process. Thus, the
model considers that the OUTPUT of innovation is a depen-
dent variable that shows positive and significant correlations
between the presence of some INPUT or PROCESS variables
and the achievement of product or process innovations in the
company.
In the logic of the model, it can be supposed that those com-
panies that have developed new processes or products as a
result of their innovation should obtain a superior business per-
formance to those companies that do not develop innovative
behavior. In this sense, companies that are innovative in prod-
ucts or processes should have a greater increase in sales, prof-
its, markets, or type of customer. The advantages of Crepon
et al. (1998) model is that it does not try to explain the innova-
tion process as a sequence of a series of activities in developing
new products or services; rather, the innovation process appears
with much less structure, chaotic, and less rational. By its
nature, the conversion model can define the innovation process
in service companies much better.
Figure 1 includes a graphic representation of the model
we propose (on the basis of the one of Crepon et al., 1998),

in which we can see that once the decision to innovate has
been taken (whether this is as a response to changes in the
market or a decision based on the organization's own strat-
egy) the company will make a series of resources (INPUT)
available to its innovation strategy to put new products onto
the market or make significant improvements to those
already existing, or to incorporate new or improved pro-
cesses into the company (OUTPUT). The above is put into
practice through an innovative practice which implies the
implementation of a series of activities, strategies, interrela-
tions, and management modes.
When the innovation process obtains the expected results,
a number of effects occur in the business development of the
organizations. At this point, there is feedback across the
whole model, as the business performance of the organiza-
tion will have an influence on the decision to continue the
commitment to business innovation as a strategy, and on the
resources the organization will make available for the inno-
vation strategy or the innovation process that is applied.
Variables Selection
There is a consensus in the literature about using multidi-
mensional approaches for measuring the effects of innova-
tion, although there are many theories about which such
variables should be (Dewangan & Godse, 2014). Specific
variables are established within the development of a model
that makes up the set of input, process, output, and business
performance variables. The set of variables depends on each
case of study (Edison, Bin Ali, & Torkara, 2013; Gurhan,
Ulusoy, Kilic, & Alpkan, 2011), and for that reason, the
present research should take into consideration the case of
service companies. To determine the proposed variables
(input and process), we have analyzed the scientific litera-
ture and selected those that are considered factors of success
for innovation in service companies (De Jong et al., 2003).
The proposed variables in the group of output and business
performance variables have been selected in line with those
used in the statistical studies in Spain for the case of output
variables, and following the contributions of Kemp, Folkeringa,
Jong, and Wubben (2003) for the case of business performance
variables. Table 1 establishes the list of variables proposed.
Input and Process Variables Validation
To validate and refine the input variables, an analysis has
been made using companies located in a region of Spain
(Castile-Leon) as a population. The population that is the
subject of the study is composed of a total of 51 companies,
of which 23 have between 6 and 9 employees, 24 have
between 10 and 49 employees, and four have more than 50
employees. The research was carried out through the submis-
sion of a survey by post and telephone follow-up. A total of
45 valid surveys were obtained with a confidence level of
95% and a sample error of 0.05.
A factor analysis was made with the aim of reducing the
dimensionality of the variables used and thus enabling work
on a set of variables by exploring the existence of underlying
factors or dimensions. This makes it much easier to handle
the model and to carry out later analyses.
The extraction of the factors was carried out using the
principal axes method, which explained more than 60% of
the variation. This gave rise to the appearance of seven fac-
tors. By applying an orthogonal Varimax model, a matrix of
rotated factors was obtained, which is set out in Table 2.
After analyzing the matrix of rotated factors, it was deter-
mined that the composition of the factors is as follows:
Factor 1: The variables that mainly correlate with this fac-
tor are:
·
· Staff exclusively dedicated to R&D activity
·
· No. of R&D projects set out in writing
·
· R&D activities have been carried out
·
· R&D activities have been carried out continuously

Factor 6: The variables that mainly correlate with this fac-
tor are:

·
· Customer satisfaction analyses are carried out as a rule
Factor 7: The variable that mainly correlates with this fac-
tor is:

· Technological level of the company
Based on the variables associated with each factor, we can
label each of them in the following way:
·
· Factor 1 (F1): R&D in the company
·
· Factor 2 (F2): R&D and innovation finance
·
· Factor 3 (F3): Technical profile of the human capital
·
· Factor 4 (F4): Quality and involvement in associations
·
· Factor 5 (F5): Staff incentives
·
· Factor 6 (F6): Market orientation
·
· Factor 7 (F7): Technological level
These factors conveniently explain the procedures,
behavior, and strategies related to the process of innovation
in SMEs in the ICT services sector. The improved model
can thus be represented as in Figure 2.

Hypothesis 1: The seven factors that comprise INPUT and
PROCESS variables individually show a positive and significant
incidence on the probability that the company will show positive
innovation outputs.
Hypothesis 2: Companies that show a positive innovative
performance (in other words those that have developed
product or process innovations) have had their own customers
as the main source of these innovations.
Hypothesis 3: There is a positive and significant relation
between the positive OUTPUT of the innovation process and
the company's business performance, which is materialized in an
increase in sales, profits, and reference markets, or an extension
of the company's type of customers.

Hypotheses
Once the factors that conveniently explain the INPUT and
PROCESS variables for our model have been determined,
the interest is to find out whether these factors have a posi-
tive and significant influence on the innovative or nonin-
novative character of the companies that apply them. In
this case, we want to know how the presence or absence of
various factors (those determined above) and their value or
level, influence the probability of the appearance of a
dichotomic event, such as the absence or presence of busi-
ness innovation. This is the objective of Hypothesis 1
(Table 4).
Pavitt (1984), and Kline and Rosenberg (1986), pointed
out that interaction with customers is key to the success of
innovation in services. An examination of the characteris-
tics of innovation in the service sector presents a taxonomy
that is clearly dominated by customers and their needs.
The companies analyzed declared that the main source
generating change in products and services in the ICT sec-
tor is the needs of the customers themselves, with nearly
70% of the companies answering in this way. Table 3
shows details of the results corresponding to the induce-
ment to innovation variables. This is the objective of
Hypothesis 2 (Table 4).
In the logic of the model, it can be supposed that those
companies that have developed new processes or products as
a result of their innovation should obtain a superior business
performance to those companies that do not develop innova-
tive behavior. In this sense, companies that are innovative in
products or processes should have a greater increase in sales,
profits, markets, or type of customer. This is the objective of
Hypothesis 3 (Table 4).
García Manjón et al. 7
Analysis and Results
Logistical regression analyses are used to determine whether
a binomial variable depends or not on other variables (not
necessarily binomial). In our case, the process is a binomial
variable as there are only two possible results: "success" or
"failure" (innovative or not innovative), with the probability
of each being constant in a series of repetitions.
The individual significance analysis showed that F2, F3,
and F6 variables were not significant for the model. The
results of the logistical regression were that the factors lead-
ing to innovation are, in order of importance, the technologi-
cal level of the company (F7), the effort made by the company
in R&D (F1), and finally, systems of incentives (F5). Thus,
Hypothesis 1 is only partially validated.
Finally, the specific Hypotheses 2 and 3 were validated.
This was done by carrying out two correlation analyses that
determined the relation between the inducement to innova-
tion variables for innovations and the innovative output of
the company; and a second showed the relations between the
output variables and those of business performance.
The first correlation analysis (for validating Hypothesis
2) showed a Pearson correlation value of .432 for the cor-
relation analysis between the inducement to innovations
variables and the innovative output. This shows statistical
significance for the analysis carried out, with a bilateral
significance level of .004 (valid over .001). Results
obtained for specific Hypothesis 2 show that the main
sources of generating innovation in products and services
in the ICT services sector for SMEs are those that come
from products tailored to specific customers. Thus,
Hypothesis 2 is validated.
The second correlation analysis (for validating Hypothesis
3) was a study carried out for each of the business perfor-
mance indicators to undertake the correlation analysis
between the innovative output and business performance. The
first one (increase in company profits) showed a Pearson cor-
relation of .339, with a bilateral level of significance of .028.
The second (increase in the geographical market of reference)
obtained a value of .332 in the Pearson correlation with a
bilateral level of significance of .032. The third and last
(extension of the number of type of customers) generated a
value in the Pearson correlation of -.362, with a bilateral sig-
nificance level of .017. Results confirm that the direct effect
of product innovation is the extension of the geographical
market of reference; in other words, innovative companies in
the sector have geographically more extensive markets and
companies that innovate in processes also extend the number
or type of customers. On the other hand, such innovative
companies do not necessarily show an increase in sales or
profits. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is only partially validated.
Conclusion
The results show that a more convenient theoretical innova-
tion model for SMEs in the ICT services sector is that of
Figure 3.
According to this model, the decision to innovate (and the
trigger for R&D activities in SMEs in the ICT services sector)
is the result of needs that are presented by customers (public
or private sector) in tailored projects. All the same, the factors
leading to innovation are, in order of importance, the techno-
logical level of the company, the effort made by the company
in R&D, and finally, systems of incentives.

Besides, innovative companies in the sector have geo-
graphically more extensive markets and companies that
innovate in processes also extend the number or type of
customers.
The result of the business policies expressed in the above
paragraphs is an increase in innovation both in products and
processes, but what influence does this increased innovation
have on the company's business performance? SMEs in the
ICT services sector that have introduced new or substantially
improved products onto the market have done so on the basis
of extending their geographical market of reference and suf-
fered a fall in sales over the same period. In addition, these
companies have extended the number or type of their cus-
tomers. In other words, innovation has been for them a mar-
ket growth strategy.
From a managerial perspective, each company needs to
identify which of the factors should be boosted more within
the organization, and also the implications on the business
strategy to be followed. Future research directions to deal
with that question are the study of practical strategy models
that should be followed according to their competitive posi-
tion in the market. Zhou, Yim, and Tse (2005), as well as
Mompó and Redoli (2009) proposed generic models that
could be taken as a reference.
