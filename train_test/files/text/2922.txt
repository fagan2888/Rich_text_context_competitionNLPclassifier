Abstract
Since the turn of the millennium a gap between credit growth and GDP
growth has emerged in Germany. The gap widens with surpluses of the
German trade balance to other euro area countries and becomes negative,
when surpluses of the trade balance contract. This phenomenon is accom-
panied by a new pattern of money growth, which is not driven by domestic
credit of banks any more but by their net foreign assets. German nonfinan-
cial corporations have rising equity ratios and provide other sectors with
funds on a net basis. Moreover, their deposits with German banks have
grown at a much stronger pace than their loans. We suspect that German
membership in the European monetary union is an important explanation
of the changing behavior in the real and financial sector and show the sub-
stitution between export cash-flows and domestic credit theoretically in a
two-country model of post-Keynesian type, in which the two countries use
a common currency.

1 Introduction
The recent financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession resurrected public
and professional interest in fundamental questions on the money system. Over
the Great Moderation period these concerns took a back seat to a view of mone-
tary policy conducted exclusively by changing interest rates. In academic circles,
money and credit aggregates moved away from mainstream economics. Taylor-like
rules became the standard approach to model central bank behaviour in the 1990s
(see, for example, Svensson 1997), while money and credit aggregates disappeared
from the bulk of monetary policy models (see, for example, Woodford 2003) de-
spite the fact that banks create the major part of money in our financial system.
Focusing on money and credit aggregates challenged central banks as standard
money demand models had difficulties in explaining monetary dynamics on the
basis of developments in the traditional determinants, such as output, prices and
interest rates. However, a central bank cannot ignore the information from mone-
tary developments in its assessment and policy considerations, though the relevant
debate is rather how they should do so.
Besides the dominant neo-classical and New Keynesian mainstream, the post-
Keynesian research paradigm allows for a comprehensive modeling of monetary
variables in the stock-flow consistent framework. Godley and Lavoie (2007) pro-
vide a compendium to these modeling techniques. Beyond the post-Keynesian
school of thought, Werner (1997, 2005) was also a distinctive exception in the pre-
crisis period. As already claimed long ago by Schumpeter (1917(1956)) Werner
repeatedly stresses the fundamental importance of credit creation process and its
institutional setup for sustainable growth and financial stability. The financial
crisis led to a critical assessment of the current monetary order, which includes a
revival of the Chicago Plan (see Benes and Kumhof 2012) and 100 percent reserves
as proposed by Fisher (1936). Others try to formulate alternative approaches for
considering the modern money system without disregarding its operational char-
acteristics, see for example Roche (2011).
The focus of our analysis is less radical. The starting puzzle is the fact that
German credit does not drive German money and that there is a gap between Ger-
man credit growth and GDP growth. German enterprises were traditionally known
for their strong bank dependence and low equity ratios and not surprisingly, bank
2
credit to the nonfinancial corporate sector was the main driving force of German
money growth. Since the turn of the millenium this equity ratios started growing
steadily and deposits of nonfinancial corporations increased strongly in relation
to bank credit. Current account surpluses, in particular, trade account surpluses,
increased, while growth of net foreign assets at German banks increased at an
even stronger pace. A major destination of both, the real sector and the financial
flows, were other EMU countries. German enterprises provided other sectors with
funds on a net basis as their surplus funds in the non-financial corporation sector
increased, i.e. the increase of gross investment fell short of the sum of retained
earnings and depreciation.1 Internal financing dominated, while a changing struc-
ture of external financing contributed to waning traditional bank credit only to a
minor extent.2
The driving forces of German money changed. It is not driven by domestic
bank credit any more, but by foreign credit. Accordingly, net foreign assets are
now the main counterpart of the German contribution to euro area money.
In our work we attempt an inspection of driving factors for German low credit
growth in an alternative monetary framework. Despite the importance of export
orientation there may be another important reason: German membership in the
European monetary union by itself. An unique combination of export competi-
tiveness and a membership in a large monetary union form the frame (common
currency, no exchange rates) where domestic credit is partly substituted by cur-
rent account surpluses surpluses. Hence, in some sense we confirm the conclusions
of Koo (2008), who suspects that Germany used its high export performacne to
escape a balance sheet recession in the beginning of the millenium. In addition,
we point out how operational characteristics of a monetary union can change the
credit creation dynamics in the corresponding countries. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows: Section 2 establishes the "Puzzle" of German credit growth
by identifying a credit gap, which "lacks" respective the observed GDP expan-
sion rate. Section 3 attempts to explain the gap by relating it to German trade

part of their funding needs using the equity capital provided by their parent companies, see
Bundesbank (2012).
2While the share of market-based external financing has remained virtually unchanged, credit
to the corporate sector has gained importance during the periods of economic weakness in the
years 2001-03 and 2008-09, see Bundesbank (2012).

surpluses with the Eurozone countries. The next section reconsiders our findings
from the European perspective, indicating that the "closing" of German credit
gap was, however, hardly possible without participation of the German banking
system. Section 5 outlines the substitution mechanics between export cash-flows
and domestic credit theoretically in a simple two-country model of post-Keynesian
type. The final section concludes.
2 The Puzzle of German Credit Growth
In the last two decades it is hardly possible to find any stable correlations between
credit aggregates and aggregated measures of economic activity like GDP in Ger-
many. To illustrate these empirical findings in more detail we compute the results
of Granger causality test as well as simple correlations between the growth rates
of nominal German GDP and nominal bank credit volume to non-bank firms, see
upper plot of Figure 1. The statistics are calculated for different subsamples of
the last three decades, the results are displayed in Table 1. In the decade be-
fore the German reunification credit growth Granger causes GDP growth and the
correlation between them is positive. In the first decade after the reunification
there is no significant link between credit and GDP growth in terms of Granger
causality. During the last decade the direction of Granger causality changes and
the correlation becomes negative.
However, a stable positive relationship between credit and output is crucial
for estimating any credit demand or supply equation. Now our intention is to
decompose the German credit growth and to extract a component, which is highly
correlated with the production dynamics. Finally we demonstrate that the pro-
posed decomposition works well before the reunification and in the first decade
after it but fails in the last one.
For this purpose we adopt the framework proposed by Werner (1997) and
explained in more detail in Werner (2005), called the quantity theorem of disag-
gregated credit. Werner builds his analysis on the well-known quantity theory of
money, agruing that an increase of output, expressed in terms of number and value
of transactions in an economy in a given period (Q), can only be achieved by the

corresponding expansion of money stock in circulation (M),
MV = PQ, (1)
where V is the money velocity and P the price level. However, the traditional
quantity theory exposed a rather bad performance in terms of the money velocity
in the past. Economic theory postulates a constant money velocity, but this is
empirically not the case, since a trending money velocity was required in order to
balance two sides of the quantity equation.
Werner (1997, 2005) claims, however, that the quantity equation in its emirical
form with the gross domestic product as output measure actually is not an equation
since the money stock in circulation is also used in transactions, which are not
measured by the GDP, for example, most of financial transactions. For this reason,
if the number of non-GDP transactions increases, for example due to a financial
market boom, the estimated money velocity has to decrease, otherwise the equation
is not balanced. In order to balance the equation we should use a money measure
that is only used for GDP transactions, however no such measure exists because
it is hardly possible to differentiate between deposits for GDP and deposits for
non-GDP purposes. Hence, Werner proposes to change the balance sheet side
considering credit aggregates. This change is appropriate since banks expand the
size of both sides of their balance sheets by granting loans and creating deposits
simultaneously. However, only bank loans or other form of bank investments
are considered, because investments by non-bank institutions do not constitute
creation of new means of payments but only a redistribution of available means
6
of payments in the economy. Typically banks are required to report information
about borrowers if they lend. This information could be used to discriminate
between credit aggregates for different purposes, thus enabling us to approximate
credit for GDP and non-GDP uses.
First, Werner (1997) formulates the Quantity Equation in terms all economic
transactions
CV = PQ, (2)
where C, V , P and Q denote credit, money velocity, price level and the total
number of transactions respectively. Second, GDP-based and non-GDP transac-
tions are separated, so that Q is replaced by real GDP Y . However, credit, money
velocity and price level are replaced as well, linking new measures to the GDP
CY V Y = PY Y, (3)
with CY , V Y and PY denoting credit for GDP-based transactions, money velocity
in the real economy and finally the GDP deflator. Assuming a constant money ve-
locity and considering growth rates instead of levels the equation can be simplified
considerably as follows
cY

where yN

and cY

are nominal GDP and credit for GDP transactions in logs re-
spectively. Since nominal GDP series are available for most countries, the main
task reduces to finding appropriate measures of credit aggregate for productive
purposes.
Now we apply the framework of the quantity theorem of disaggregated credit
to study the credit growth in Germany. First, a measure of credit aggregate
for productive purposes has to be found. An obvious choice for the productive
credit aggregate is bank credit granted to non-bank firms. Since housing credit
and mortgages of private households are often used for non-GDP transactions
like buying land or already existing real estate, we do not include them in our
productive credit measure. Furthermore, consumption credit usually played only
a minor role in Germany, so that we do not include it until now as well. The
results turned out to be robust also after including consumption credit.
Growth rates of nominal GDP and bank credit for non-financial firms are plot-
7
ted in the upper subplot of Figure 1. We see that even though the one-to-one
relationship between credit and production growth seems to be fulfilled, this is a
very rough approximation, since rather large and persistent deviations from the
postulated equations are observed. In particular, there are two subsequent peri-
ods, where we observe a significant gap between the credit and GDP growth: (a)
the decade after the German reunification as well as (b) the subsequent decade
which is mainly characterized by the existence and functioning of the European
Monetary Union.
In order to refine the productive credit measure we consider also bank credit
for non-banks subject to different industry branches. The overall series of bank
credit for non-banks exhibits a rising GDP-to-credit ratio. It turns out that this is
mainly due to the credit granted to the business services branch. The ratio of credit
for business services firms to its own value added is strongly rising until the last
decade. The branch of financial services (non-banks) features very high and erratic
credit growth rates as well. Hereupon we remove these two components from the
overall bank credit to non-banks and compare it with the GDP growth rates again,
see the lower plot in Figure 1. It is easy to see that the approximation resemble
the GDP growth between 1973 and 2000 very closely. However, the subtraction of
financial and business services credit from the total bank credit volume for non-
bank firms enlarges the gap between the productive credit series and GDP growth
even more. Moreover, the new credit growth series keeps its negative correlation
with the GDP growth during the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery.
In addition, we performed some robustness checks by testing whether other
liability components of non-banks are sufficient to close the gap between credit
and production growth in the last decade. We considered the credit volumes of
non-banks from the German flow of funds, which include credit granted to non-
banks from abroad as well as credit granted by other non-banks. Further, bonds
issued by non-banks as well as their total liabilities were considered. However,
none of these modifications turned out to be sufficient to close the gap between
nominal GDP and liability growth of non-banks - the shape of the series remained
qualitatively the same in all cases.

3 The Ebb and Flow of Retained Profits
There seems to be a gap between credit growth of non-bank firms and German
GDP growth. A possible solution is foreign credit, which can drive domestic money
growth. Foreign credit, however, does not provide financing for domestic firms,
but financing of those who purchase goods and services from domestic firms. We
rewrite the equation in the following way
cY
t
+ gt
= yN
t
, (5)
where gt
denotes the credit gap. Indeed if we consider the consolidated balance
sheet of the German banking system and compute the quotient between the volume
of all bank deposits of non-bank firms and bank credit granted to non-bank firms,
the corresponding picture supports the view stated in Equation 5. As shown in
Figure 2 the deposit volume expanded with a higher rate than the credit borrowed
by non-bank firms since the start of the millenium. Consequently there was no
evident shortage of money, which could hinder the expansion of economic activity.
At the turn of the millenium a continuing improvement of the German export
performance relative to the other member states was under way. Many argue
that the widening trade and current account surpluses reflect structural reforms
initiated in the early 2000s, which boosted German competitiveness. Surpluses,
however, in particular grew to Southern member states of EMU such as Greece,
Portugal, Italy and Spain. Furthermore, money creation in Germany changed
considerably. This suggests that German membership in the European monetary
union was also important. While domestic credit to non-banks was the driving
force of money creation in Germany before the monetary union, net foreign assets
became the dominating counterpart of the German contribution to money in the
euro area. In Figure 3 (upper plot) we present money growth in Germany and the
contribution of the main counterparts to money growth from 1990 to 2012.3 Figure
3 gives evidence that the pattern of money creation changed considerably with the
start of the monetary union. Furthermore, an analysis of national contributions
3A direct comparison of the two periods is difficult due to statistical breaks and changes in
the definition of money and to the fact that currency as part of money cannot be nationally
earmarked in a monetary union any more. Furthermore, net foreign assets in Germany include
interbank claims in the euro area and also TARGET-balances of the Bundesbank, which did not
exist before monetary union.

to money and its counterparts in the euro area shows that credit creation has
increasingly shifted to southern European countries, namely to Spain, before the
outbreak of the crisis (see Deutsche Bundesbank 2013, p. 51).
Thus if current account and trade balances are widening, the demand for do-
mestic credit is expected to decrease. The credit gap gt
defined in Equation 5 is
positive and the corresponding credit aggregates tend to contract given some GDP
level. This is what we observe in the upper plot of Figure 4. Absolute seasonal
differences of German trade balances relative to the European Union (where the
Eurozone constitutes the bulk of dynamics and other countries are closely related
to it) are fitting the credit gap quite well.4 The resemblance is especially close
at the trough of the Great Recession. Here the credit gap becomes negative, the
trade balance contracts rapidly and more domestic credit is demanded in order to
compensate for the shortage of inflowing liquidity. It is worth mentioning why we
have to differentiate the trade balance. Since the whole economy is expanding, only
a growing trade balance can compensate the positive credit gap. Consequently if
trade balance stops widening, credit contraction has to revert providing necessary
funds for the expanding economy. This is what we observe just before the outbreak
of the financial crisis.
Next we check whether the credit gap gt
is only resembled by current account
and trade imbalance with European countries. In the lower plot of Figure 4 abso-
lute seasonal differences of German trade balance relative to all non-EU countries
and the credit gap are compared. A visual inspection shows that the comovement
is not as pronounced as in the EU case. Even more striking are the corresponding
correlations, computed for 2000-2013 period: 0.78 for the upper plot and 0.20 for
the lower plot. There is virtually no significant correlation between the credit gap
and the trade balance dynamics relative to the non-EU countries.
We can draw the following conclusion: if a competitive country is a member
in a monetary union and is running a significant current account surplus with
other members of the monetary union, then differences between domestic and
foreign credit creation can more easily fade away. If export revenues are strongly
increasing, non-financial firms finance themselves via retained profits which tend to
4We amalgamed the Eurozone and non-EMU EU-countries into one group, since the Eurozone
dynamics dominates in absolute terms and the trade balance with the non-EMU part is closely
correlated with the EMU. The non-EMU part of the European Union has also strong financial
links with the Eurozone.
10
substitute domestic credit. If export revenues sharply decrease due, for example,
to some unexpected transitory shock, the firms demand more domestic credit in
order to bridge the recession. In such an economy the credit dynamics is supposed
to be anticyclical relative to GDP, increasing retained profits correspond with
decreasing domestic credit demand. This is in contrast to the standard case where
increasing domestic credit creation stimulates production expansion and retained
profits.
4 Money Creation in the EMU Perspective
According to the evidence German export firms demand less domestic credit and
finance higher production from retained profits, when export revenues are high,
at least inside a monetary union. The missing link between GDP growth and
credit growth seem to be changes in retained profits, but this is not the end of the
story, because also retained profits ultimately need a source of financing. Export
revenues of German firms are import expenditures abroad, which are financed by
foreign credit to foreign nonbanks. The funding for the foreign credit business
increasingly took place abroad, but inside EMU. An important reason for the
increase of cross-border funding of European banks was the start of the monetary
union, or presumably and more precisely, the misinterpretation of what a monetary
union means for the pricing of credit risk. We suspect that an underpricing of credit
risk unduly eased financing conditions and fostered cross-border flows. Thereby,
foreign banks could fund themselves in the converging EMU financial market, for
example, by interbank borrowing or by issuing bank securities.5
Financing conditions considerably eased with the start of the monetary union
in EMU countries, because there was no exchange rate risk any more inside EMU
and market participants also decreased their pricing of credit risk, last but not
least, because they did not believe in the no bail-out clause of the EU treaty. This
expectation, however, can change rapidly. Two examples support this evidence.
For short-term funding in the euro area the spreads between rates for collateralized
and uncollateralized interbank transactions (as measured, for example, by Euribor
5Not only banks but also special purpose vehicles (SPVs) funded themselves abroad. When
the access of SPVs to capital markets deteriorated, banks bought the securities issued by "their"
SPVs and thereby assumed the risk formerly held off balance sheet.
11
- Eurepo 3M-spreads) is a proxy for the price of credit risk, which banks consider
as a benchmark. The average spread measured in basis points remained in single
digits pre-crisis and presumably, banks only added very small margins in order
to price the individual credit risk of their counterparties. During the crisis, how-
ever, the spread swiftly reached three digit numbers and many banks drastically
decreased credit limits to counterparties indicating that this funding source not
only dried up due to lower demand at higher rates but also due to credit rationing.
Though the average spread has declined again, market participants may expect
that spreads will never return to their low pre-crisis level.
Second, spreads of sovereign bond yields serve as a benchmark for longer term
financing in the financial market and for indicating sovereign credit risk. The
spreads of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish 10-year-government bond yields to
German bunds, for example, averaged at about 400 basis points in the mid-1990s6,
before they rapidly converged to a much lower level in the run-up to the monetary
union. During monetary union, but pre-crisis, a period which in retrospective is
often called the honey moon, the spreads averaged at lower double digit numbers
until the collapse of Lehman in September 2008. During the European sovereign
debt crisis they increased rapidly to levels of the mid-1990s again or even higher.
Starting from mid 2012 spreads declined rapidly within a few months, which some
relate to Draghi's famous "whatever it takes" speech and the following OMT-
announcement of the European Central Bank, though spreads in retail interest
rates remain elevated compared to Germany and other so called "core countries".
Given the fact that the pricing of credit risk in the euro area is drastically
re-adjusted whenever market sentiments change, the market for pricing credit risk
may not always efficiently deal with information and reflect it in the price imme-
diately.7
The behavior of banks in Germany also changed with the developments of fi-
nancing conditions in the monetary union. As shown in Figure 3 (lower plot)
their net foreign assets to abroad and denominated in domestic currency surged to
above 1 trillion euro in the early 2000s, while ranging between 100 and 200 billion

7Behavioral finance has supplemented the efficient market hypothesis and recognizes that
individuals neither are able to process the full set of information at the same time nor evalu-
ate it systematically and rationally as assumed by the extremely strict assumptions of a homo
economicus, see Barberis and Thaler (2003) for a survey.

euro during the decade before the start of the monetary union. The develop-
ment was mainly driven by increasing assets towards EMU countries, in particular
Southern European countries, though the latest developments are heavily influ-
enced by changes in liabilities to Britain. Net foreign assets denominated in Euro
have halved again since they peaked in 2008. The crisis has heightened the risk
awareness of banks and suddenly changed financing conditions. Accumulated trade
surpluses, however, continue, because funding from the Eurosystem partly substi-
tuted the lack of funding from sources in the private sector. Large and diverging
TARGET balances at national central banks in the Eurosystem are a symptom
of this asymmetric provision of central bank liquidity in the Eurosystem and sig-
nal an alternative reaction to sudden stops of private capital inflows than sharp
exchange rate depreciations.8
We conclude that the start of the monetary union greatly facilitated financing in
EMU countries, which fostered domestic credit booms in some of them and export
booms in others, namely in Germany. This contributed to the gap between GDP
growth and credit growth in Germany. Credit of foreign banks to foreign non-banks
creates money that finances trade between Germany and its export destinations
and that eventually increases wealth of exporting firms. Assuming that (at least
part of) the wealth is held on accounts at banks in Germany, the banks receive
additional funding via the export revenues of their customers, which they can
invest abroad. Pre-crisis, increasing net foreign assets of banks in Germany have
refinanced foreign credit expansion and have contributed to the easing of financing
conditions. This has been partly substituted by public cross border claims, i.e.
TARGET balances of the Bundesbank, during the crisis. Generally speaking,
credit still creates money, though it is not necessarily domestic credit that creates
8The start of the monetary union is just one of many factors influencing structural changes
in the banking sector. In an environment of decreasing levels of interest rates in developed
economies, stronger de-regulation and higher competition in the financial sector, the tradi-
tional sources of banks' earnings from interest business, became unsatisfactory and were grad-
ually substituted by banks' earnings from commission business and own account trading. The
start of the monetary union offered new profit opportunities of banks that were increasingly
put under pressure from these structural developments. Additionally, some special develop-
ments at Landesbanks, such as the lifting of state guarantees, which eventually took place in
mid 2005, for ensuring the institutions' solvency (Anstaltslast) and for indemnifying depositors
(Gew¨
ahrtr¨
agerhaftung) triggered large scale issuance of bank securities shortly before and a cor-
responding search for yield for the new funding, which was increasingly taking place in EMU
countries.

the domestic, i.e. the national contribution to money in the euro area. The
easing of financing conditions, higher net foreign assets of banks in Germany and
stronger foreign credit creation reinforced each other. Eventually, it should be kept
in mind that the strongly changing price for credit risk lies at the heart of these
developments and could be based on a misperception of the financial sector that
yet has not found a fundamental value.
5 A Small Two-Country Model
The goal of the current section is to demonstrate how the negative short-run
link between output and credit in the presence of export trade surpluses outlined
above can be resembled even in the context of a simplistic stock-flow consistent
model. For this purpose we adopt a slightly changed version of the model OPEN
introduced by Godley and Lavoie (2007) in their section 6.6. The model OPEN
comprises four economic sectors and two countries. The sectors are households,
producers, government and central bank. The countries trade with each other.
However, due to the assumption of two different currencies the central banks hold
gold reserves which enable import transactions. If the trade is not balanced, the
country with trade deficit loses gold reserves and the one with trade surpluses
accumulates them. The unbalanced trade can continue as long as the central
bank of the deficit country is willing or able to provide gold reserves for import
transactions.
For our purposes we abandon the assumption of two currencies, but maintain
the framework of two countries with two central banks, which allows to mimic
the institutional setup of the Eurozone to some extent. Bearing in mind that
in our simplistic model the domestic banking system is amalgamated with the
14
central bank, the trade deficits are financed by incurring net foreign liabilities
in domestic currency. Inside the model this process can continue ad infinitum
while the system approches a non-stationary steady-state, since no endogenous
stabilising mechanisms are considered forcing both countries towards a balanced
trade path. Cross border transactions between the two countries are settled by
changes in net foreign positions at their balance sheets. In contrast to gold, which
is the international means of payments in section 6.6 of Godley and Lavoie (2007),
increasing net foreign assets of the trade surplus country are financial assets with a
liability as their counterpart and are not limited by physical quantity. We outline
the main equations and features of the model. For a more detailed treatment of
post-keynesian models Godley and Lavoie (2007) is probably the best reference
available currently.
First, consider the balance sheet matrix of the model, which is presented in
Table 2. The balance sheet matrix comprises of a nothern and southern part,
however, due to their analogy and in order to save the space only the northern part
is put into the table. The households allocate their wealth in non-interest-bearing
deposits and interest-bearing bills. The bills are issued by the government. The
central bank purchases government bills and injects high powered money (assumed
in forms of deposits) into the economy. If the corresponding country runs trade
surpluses, the central bank accumulates net foreign assets. In case of trade deficit
net foreign liabilities are accumulated. Finally, the household wealth is the sum
of government bills and net foreign assets.
Table 3 contains the transaction matrix for the northern country, however, all
columns sum to zero only if the southern part is considered as well. In partic-
ular, northern exports and imports correspond to southern imports and exports
respectively. The same holds for net foreign assets and liabilities. Government
expenditures constitute the core of the model and correspond to autonomous con-
sumption in models without government sector, since G = 0 implies that all other
model variables converge to zero as well. The government finances expenditures
primarly by taxes. The recurrent fiscal deficits are firstly covered by selling bills to
households. If households do not demand the required amount of bills, they will be
purchased by the central bank. This is how new money is injected into monetary
circuit of the model. If the government runs fiscal surpluses or households demand
more bills than needed, the government liabilities to the central bank are settled

All model equations are adopted from Godley and Lavoie (2007) and are doc-
umented in the appendix. We need only four behavioral equation for the model
closure: consumption function, import and tax function and portfolio decision
function. The households hold non-interest-bearing deposits because of the trans-
action motive. In order to keep the setup as simple as possible the north and the
south posses equal model coefficients but the import prospensities:
Mi = µiY i. (6)
If µN = µS, the trade is balanced and the system reaches a stationary steady-state
with zero fiscal deficit and zero level of net foreign assets and liabilities, since
NFAN = XN - MN . (7)
If µN > µS, the north runs trade and fiscal surpluses, which is offset by equal trade
and fiscal deficits in the south, since government expenditures are exogenous. Due
to fiscal surplus the northern government pays back its debt to the central bank.
First, the balance sheet size of the northern central bank remains constant since
the diminishing stock of bills on the assets side is offset by the growing stock
of net foreign assets, see Figure 7. An asset swap takes place so that the balance
16
sheet size of the central bank in the north remains stationary in the non-stationary
steady-state. If the stock of bills is depleted on the asset side, increasing net foreign
assets and increasing government deposits, which are negative holdings of bills at
the central bank, lead to balance sheet growth.
Surpluses of the north correspond to deficits in the south financed by issuing
new central bank money. Since the stock of bills owned by households converges to
a constant level, the central bank purchases additional bills permanently and the
asset side of its balance sheet expands. On the liabilities side the growing stock
of bills is compensated by growing net foreign liabilities (Figure 7) while the stock
of money remains stationary. Hence, the non-stationary steady-state in the south
leads to non-stationary balance sheet growth of the banking system.
Our simulation exercise starts from a stationary steady-state, where all co-
efficient in the north equals to the southern coefficients. Since the government
expenditures levels are also identical, all model variables converges to same levels
in the north and in the south, see Figures 5 and 6 before 2000. After 2000 the
import prospensity of the south, µS
, is increased carrying the system to a new
non-stationary steady-state. However, all model variables exept the stock of gov-
ernment bills (Bi), the stock of government bills purchased by the central bank
(Bi
cb
) and the net foreign assets (NFAi) remain stationary, see Figures 5 and 6
between 2000 and 2006. Then the government expenditures in the south are ex-
ogenously reduced for a period of two years, while the government expenditures
in the north remain constant. Subsequently this shock causes transitory output
losses in both countries. The households also reduce their holdings of bills and
non-interest-bearing deposits adjusting the lower GDP level. Nevertheless, the
government debt in the north reacts in the exactly opposite way - it is increasing.
The reason for this negative relation between government indebtness and output in
the north is the exogeneity of government expenditure. Since GN remains constant
while export revenues are falling due to weaker import demand in the south, the
northern fiscal balance switches into negative area and the government is forced
to finance its expenditures by issuing new bills.
We bear in mind that the central bank can be considered as a proxy for the
whole domestic banking system in our simplistic monetary circiut. It is also rea-
sonable to view the government and producers as including also all private firms
which have access to credit via government bills, where the taxes partly play the
17
role of retained profits. Under these assumption the analogy of our simple model
outcome to the empircal findings stated above becomes obvious. Since the north-
ern firms expect the demand shock in the south to be transitory and as long as
they believe in their "business strategy", they react to the output decreases by
going deeper into debt maintaining the necessary level of money in the monetary
circuit, which resembles the negative correlation between GDP and credit flow to
the non-bank firms in German data.
6 Conclusions
Since the turn of the millenium the pattern of money and credit changed in Ger-
many. Domestic credit did not drive "domestic" money, or more precisely, the
national contribution to euro area money. We argue that the start of the mone-
tary union had an impact as it triggered an easing of financing conditions, which
facilitated credit booms abroad and current account surpluses in Germany. Ger-
man export firms demand less domestic credit and finance higher production from
retained profits, when export revenues are high. Foreign credit to foreign non-
banks developed as an important source of financing for trade surpluses and GDP
growth and contributed to the gap between GDP growth and credit growth in Ger-
many. Increasing net foreign assets of banks in Germany have refinanced foreign
credit expansion and thereby, fostered the easing of financing conditions. During
the crisis, though, this has been partly substituted by public cross border claims,
i.e. TARGET balances of the Bundesbank. The experience of credit, GDP growth
and current account surpluses in Germany supports the fact that export surpluses
are not an imbalance of savings and investment, but rather an imbalance of fi-
nancing and investment. The financing of credit booms abroad may fuel further
easing of financing conditions. Financing conditions channel the flow of credit and
depend on the risk awareness of market participants. Keeping in mind that the
pricing of credit risk may be less efficient than commonly believed, credit creation
may also be suboptimal. Thus, the question remains whether the new paradigm
of money and credit will be sustainable. Can countries, which maintain ongoing
surpluses in their trade balances, achieve much the same objective of enhancing
their economic growth and employment as long as they ensure that their debtors
can finance their trade deficit (see Kaldor 1978)? Answers probably lie beyond
18
pure economic reasoning.
