Drinking and Adult Abusive and Dependent
Drinking to the Alcohol Industry
Susan E. Foster, MSW; Roger D. Vaughan, DrPH; William H. Foster, PhD; Joseph A. Califano, Jr, LLB
Objectives: To document quantity and cash value of
underage and adult Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)­defined abu-
sive and dependent drinking as well as underage drink-
ing and adult DSM-IV­defined abusive and dependent
drinking combined to the alcohol industry.
Design: Analysis of multiple cross-sectional national data
sets.
Setting: The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, the 2001 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the 2001
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, the 2000 US
Census, the 2000 to 2001 National Epidemiological Sur-
vey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, and the 2001
Adams Business Research.
Participants: A total of 260 580 persons aged 12 years
and older across 4 data sources.
Main Exposure: Underage drinking or pathological
drinking defined as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for abu-
sive or dependent drinking.
Main Outcome Measures: Total amount of alcohol
consumed and the cash value for alcohol consumed
among underage and adult drinkers with DSM-IV­
defined alcohol abuse and dependence as well as all un-
derage drinkers combined with adult drinkers with DSM-
IV­defined alcohol abuse and dependence.
Results: The short-term cash value of underage drinking
to the alcohol industry was $22.5 billion in 2001--17.5%
oftotalconsumerexpendituresforalcohol.Thelong-term
commercialvalueofunderagedrinkingisthecontribution
ofunderagedrinkingtomaintainingconsumptionamong
adultdrinkerswithalcoholabuseanddependence,which
was equal to at least $25.8 billion in 2001.
Conclusions: The combined value of illegal underage
drinking and adult pathological drinking to the indus-
try was at least $48.3 billion, or 37.5% of consumer ex-
penditures for alcohol, in 2001. Alternative estimates sug-
gest that these costs may be closer to $62.9 billion, or
48.8% of consumer expenditures for alcohol.

AN IMPORTANT NATIONAL
health objective in the
United States is to prevent
and reduce the incidence of
pathological drinking
among Americans.1 Federal dietary guide-
lines recognize that "higher levels of alco-
hol intake raise the risk for high blood pres-
sure, stroke, heart disease, certain cancers,
accidents, violence, suicides, birth defects,
and overall mortality. Too much alcohol
may cause cirrhosis of the liver, inflamma-
tionofthepancreas,anddamagetothebrain
and heart."2 Abusive and dependent drink-
ing is recognized clinically as a pathologi-
cal condition in the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition (DSM-IV).3 Alcohol abuse and al-
coholism cost the nation $184 billion in
1998,4 more than cancer ($107 billion) or
obesity ($100 billion).5
Research suggests that an effective way
to prevent pathological drinking is to de-
lay the onset of regular drinking.6-14 For ex-
ample, Grant and Dawson6 found that in-
dividuals who begin drinking before age 15
years are 4 times likelier to become alco-
hol dependent than those who do not drink
beforeage21years,andtheyalsofoundthat
the odds of lifetime alcohol dependence
were reduced by 14% with each increasing
year of age at first use. Expanding on these
findings, DeWit et al12 found that the inci-
dence of lifetime alcohol abuse and depen-
dence is greatest for those who begin drink-
ing between the ages of 11 and 14 years.
Despite knowledge of this relationship be-
tweenearlyonsetofdrinkingandlaterabuse
and dependence, more than 13 000 teens
younger than age 21 years take their first
drink each day.15 Slightly more than 6000
ofthesebeginningdrinkersareyoungerthan
age 16 years.15 In 2001, 47% of 12- to 20-
year-olds reported that they were current
drinkers; 30% of them admitted to binge
drinking in the past month.15

drinking and adult pathological drinking to the industry.
In this article, we close this gap in research. First, we
reexamine the incidence of underage and adult drinking.
Next, we consider the proportion of underage and adult
drinking that can be clinically characterized as abusive and
dependent drinking as well as the percentage of alcohol
consumedbysuchdrinkers.Finally,wedocumentthecom-
mercial value of underage and adult abusive and depen-
dent drinking to the alcohol industry as well as the com-
bined commercial value of underage drinking and adult

METHODS
DATA SOURCES AND MEASURES
We relied on several national data sets to help define the fol-
lowing: (1) the number and proportion of underage and adult
drinkers; (2) alcohol consumption by underage and adult drink-
ers as well as by underage and adult drinkers with alcohol abuse
and dependence; and (3) the cash value of underage drinking
as well as of underage and adult abusive and dependent drink-
ing to the alcohol industry.
NUMBER AND PROPORTION
OF UNDERAGE AND ADULT DRINKERS
To compute alcohol consumption by age group, we first used
the 2000 US Census19 to estimate the number of people in the
United States aged 12 to 20 years and 21 years and older.
To estimate the proportion of people aged 12 to 20 years
who drank in the past month (ie, current drinkers), we con-
sidered several data sets, including the 2001 National House-
hold Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA)20 and the 2001 Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS).21 The NHSDA, administered by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
Rockville, Md, used a nationally representative sample of 55 561
persons, including 24264 persons aged 12 to 20 years and 31297
persons aged 21 years and older. The YRBS, administered by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga,
used a nationally representative sample of 13 601 persons in
grades 9 through 12, with observed ages from 12 to 18 years
(if the participating high school students were older than 18
years, they were recoded as 18-year-olds). We concluded that
the YRBS data are the most accurate for purposes of estimating
the proportion of underage individuals (aged 12-20 years) who
drank in the past 30 days. Several studies22-27 have demon-
strated that the NHSDA data tend to underestimate the pro-
portion of underage drinkers who consume alcohol and the
amounts they consume since it is based on personal inter-
views performed in a household and because children are only
interviewed when a parent is in the home. The YRBS provides
more accurate estimates because it is administered in schools,
with the added benefit of anonymity, and because of the order
and content of the survey questions.22-27
Toestimatetheproportionofpersonsaged21yearsandolder
who drank in the past month, we used the 2001 Behavioral Risk
FactorSurveillanceSurvey,28 whichwasalsoadministeredbythe
CentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention.The2001Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance Survey is a telephone survey of 212 510
respondents, including 148 325 persons aged 21 years or older.
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
BY UNDERAGE AND ADULT DRINKERS
AND BY UNDERAGE AND ADULT DRINKERS
WITH ALCOHOL ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE
Weusedthe2001NHSDAtocomputetheamountofalcoholcon-
sumedbyunderageandadultdrinkers,theprevalenceofabusive
and dependent drinking as defined by DSM-IV criteria, and the
amountofalcoholconsumedbyunderageandadultdrinkerswith
alcoholabuseanddependence.TheNHSDAaskedthefollowing
questionsaboutalcoholconsumption:"Thinkspecificallyabout
the past 30 days--that is, since (fill in date), up to and including
today. During the past 30 days, on how many days did you drink
1ormoredrinksofanalcoholicbeverage?"and"Onthedayswhen
youdrankduringthepast30days,howmanydrinksdidyouusu-
ally have? Count as a drink a can or bottle of beer; a wine cooler
oraglassofwine,champagne,orsherry;ashotofliquor;oramixed
drinkorcocktail."TheNHSDAalsoincludedtheitemsnecessary
for a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence.
We defined pathological drinking according to the DSM-IV
criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence. The NHSDA asked
respondents about the 4 domains related to alcohol abuse, de-
fined by the DSM-IV as "a maladaptive pattern of substance use
manifested by recurrent and significant adverse conse-
quences,"3 and the 7 domains related to alcohol dependence,
defined by the DSM-IV as "a maladaptive pattern of substance
use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress."3
A respondent was labeled as abusing alcohol if he or she ex-
hibited any 1 of 4 conditions in the previous year. The respon-
dent was labeled as substance dependent by the DSM-IV crite-
ria if the respondent exhibited 3 or more of 7 conditions at any
time in the previous year.3
CASH VALUE OF UNDERAGE DRINKING
AND UNDERAGE AND ADULT
ABUSIVE AND DEPENDENT DRINKING
TO THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY
To estimate consumer expenditures linked to underage drink-
ing and to underage and adult drinkers who met or did not meet
the DSM-IV criteria for abusive or dependent drinking, the total
amount (in gallons and liters) of beer, distilled spirits, and wine
consumed by each group in 2001 was calculated using data on
consumer expenditures for alcohol reported by the alcohol in-
dustry and published by Adams Business Research.29-31
Estimating the cash value of underage and adult drinkers also
requires information on the proportion of the type of drink (beer
vsdistilledspiritsvswine)consumedbyunderageandadultdrink-
ers and by those who met vs did not meet the DSM-IV criteria
foralcoholabuseordependence.Toourknowledge,nodatadocu-
menting the proportions by type of alcoholic beverages con-
sumed by underage drinkers aged 12 to 18 years are available.
However, Foster et al18 found that the pattern of drinking among
underage drinkers aged 12 to 20 years closely resembles the pat-
tern of drinking among adult excessive drinkers.

We estimated patterns of alcohol consumption using the 2001
to 2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Re-
lated Conditions (NESARC).32 This nationally representative sur-
vey of those aged 18 and older, administered by the National In-
stitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked participants to
identify type of drink by the categories of beer, distilled spirits,
wine, and "coolers" of all types. Because the price of coolers is
typically similar to that of beer,33-35 we redistributed the percent-
age of cooler consumption into the beer category, producing con-
sumption estimates for adults who met the DSM-IV criteria for
abuse or dependence of 70.8% beer, 18.3% distilled spirits, and
10.9% wine whereas other adult drinkers consumed 56.1% beer,
16.7% distilled spirits, and 27.2% wine. Using this same data set,
we found that underage drinkers (aged 18-20 years) who met the
DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence consumed 79.6% beer,
17.5% distilled spirits, and 2.9% wine whereas other underage
drinkers consumed 71.5% beer, 20.8% distilled spirits, and 7.7%
wine. We applied the estimated beverage type computed among
those aged 18 to 20 years to all of the underage drinkers.
To present a range of estimates of the cash value of underage
and pathological drinking, we also used the NESARC to com-
pute alternative estimates of drinking rates, consumption, and
pathological drinking rates among adults aged 21 years and older.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

TocalculatethecashvalueofeachageandDSM-IVgroup,we
multipliedthetotalamountofalcohol(intheformofbeer,wine,
and distilled spirits) consumed in the United States in 2001, as
reported in the 2003 Adams Beverage Group handbooks,29-31 by
the percentage of total alcohol consumed by each age and DSM-
IVgroup.Thecostperdrinkwasthencalculatedbytakingthetotal
consumer expenditures for beer, distilled spirits, and wine as re-
ported by the Adams Beverage Group and dividing each amount
by the total number of drinks of beer, distilled spirits, and wine,
respectively. Consumer expenditures were calculated by multi-
plyingtheoverallproportionofdrinksthateachgroupconsumed
by the proportion of that amount that was estimated to be beer,
distilledspirits,orwineandfinallybytheaveragecomputedprice
per drink for beer, distilled spirits, and wine ($1.05, $1.34, and
$1.30, respectively29-31).
Although we have accounted for the fact that underage and
adultdrinkerswithalcoholabuseanddependenceconsumelower-
cost beverages (ie, more beer), they also may consume lower-
cost products within each beverage type. If so, our results will be
marginally overestimated since, in the absence of empirical data,
we were unable to calculate the impact that such behavior would
have on consumer expenditures among these groups.
Using these procedures, we accounted for all but 0.3% of
consumer expenditures. We reallocated this small remainder
of the $128.6 billion reported by Adams Beverage Group29-31
across the age and drinking categories according to their
computed percentages of all alcohol expenditures. All of the
analyses using nationally representative data sets incorpo-
rated the appropriate weighting variables provided with each
data set.
RESULTS
CASH VALUE OF UNDERAGE DRINKING
AND ABUSIVE AND DEPENDENT DRINKING
TO THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY
A summary of the data sets and how they were used is
presented in Table 1. We calculated the proportion of
people in each age group who drank in the past 30 days
in 2001 and the percentage of each category who met the
DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. Among
youth aged 12 to 20 years, 47.1% were current drinkers.

ria for alcohol abuse and dependence were 25.9% among
those aged 12 to 20 years and 9.6% among those aged
21 years and older. Whereas people aged 12 to 20 years
composed 15.4% of the population aged 12 years and
older, they composed 30.1% of those meeting the DSM-IV
criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. Underage drink-
ers were 2.7 times likelier to meet the DSM-IV criteria
for alcohol abuse or dependence as compared with adult
drinkers. These results are presented in Table 2.
The mean number of drinks, the total number of drinks,
and the percentage of drinks consumed by age and DSM-IV
categories are presented in Table 3. Those who met the
DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence drank, on
average, 3 times as much per month as those who did not
meet the criteria. Underage drinkers (aged 12 to 20 years)
whomettheDSM-IVcriteriarepresentonequarter(25.9%)
of drinkers in that age group, but they consumed nearly
half of all drinks (47.3%) in that age category. Adult drink-
ers (aged 21 years and older) who met the DSM-IV criteria
represent 9.6% of drinkers in that age group, but they con-
sumed 25.0% of all drinks in that age category.
The cash value of alcohol consumption is presented
in Table 4. An estimated $128.6 billion was spent on
alcohol in the United States in 2001.29-31 Of this amount,
28.3%, or $36.3 billion, was attributable to abusive or de-
pendentdrinking.Underageabusiveanddependentdrink-
ing alone accounted for 8.2% of total consumer expen-
ditures for alcohol; adult abusive and dependent drinking
accounted for 20.1% of all of the expenditures.
The total cash value of underage drinking was $22.5
billion in 2001, or 17.5% of total consumer expendi-
tures for alcohol. Adult drinkers who met the DSM-IV
criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence accounted for
another $25.8 billion in consumer expenditures for al-
cohol. Underage drinkers and adults who met the DSM-IV
criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence together were
responsible for 37.5% ($48.3 billion) of all of the con-
sumer expenditures for alcohol.

years and older. Because the NESARC did not include
persons aged 12 to 17 years, we continued to use the YRBS
data to estimate drinking rates and the NHSDA data to
estimate drinking amounts and pathological drinking rates
among underage drinkers. In this alternative analysis, we
found that underage drinkers and adults who met the
DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence to-
gether were responsible for nearly half (48.8%, or $62.9
billion) of all of the consumer expenditures for alcohol.
COMMENT
There are several limitations of our research. First, sev-
eral data sets were used to derive various estimates for
youth and adults. Although it would have been prefer-
able to have 1 source of data, thereby controlling for pos-
sible moderating factors such as item construction,
method of administration, and time, no such single data
source exists. Therefore, as in other research of this na-
ture, we used the data sources that provided valid esti-
mates of all of the quantities of interest and provided a
conservative and alternative estimate. All of the data that
we used were publicly available national data sources.
We also made several assumptions about the propor-
tion of each type of alcoholic beverage consumed by the
various age and drinking groups. More research is clearly
necessary, especially among underage drinkers, to obtain
direct estimates of consumption amount by type and cost.
The operational definition of the term drink also needs fur-
ther exploration. The estimates produced by the NHSDA20
were based on the number of drinks of wine, beer, or dis-
tilled spirits whereas alternative approaches (the 2001-
2002 NESARC,32 the study by Kaskutas and Graves,36 and
the study by Dawson37) were based on the actual size of
thebeverageconsumedratherthanonthenumberofdrinks.
For the alcohol industry, increases in alcohol consump-
tion come either from new customers or from increased
drinking among existing customers. This analysis demon-
strates that early initiation of alcohol use provides substan-
tial financial value to the alcohol industry in both areas.
Theshort-termcashvalueistheimmediatereturnofatleast

billion per year in consumer expenditures for alcohol con-
sumed by adult drinkers with alcohol abuse and depen-
dence--ie, increased drinking among existing customers.
Almost all (96.8%) of the adult drinkers with alcohol abuse
and dependence began drinking prior to the age of 21
years.20 The combined annual worth of all underage drink-
ing(includingabusiveanddependentdrinking)andalladult
abusive and dependent drinking to the industry is at least
$48.3 billion, or 37.5% of total consumer expenditures for
alcohol,withalternativeestimatessuggestingthatthesecosts
may be closer to $62.9 billion, or 48.8% of total consumer
expenditures for alcohol. Projected into the future, this
present pattern of illegal underage drinking and adult abu-
sive and dependent drinking will realize at least one-half
trilliondollarsincashrevenuesforthealcoholindustryover
the next decade--an extraordinary commercial motive to
insure that such consumer behavior continues unabated.
The drinking behavior of 25.9% of the underage drink-
ers already met clinical criteria for alcohol abuse and de-
pendence. Although youth aged 12 to 20 years composed
15.4%ofthepopulationaged12yearsandolder,theymade
up 30.1% of all of the drinkers in the United States who
met the DSM-IV criteria for abusive and dependent drink-
ing. Of the $128.6 billion in consumer expenditures for al-
cohol in the United States in 2001, $36.3 billion, or 28.3%
of market sales, came from drinking on the part of adults
andchildrenwhomettheDSM-IVcriteriaforalcoholabuse
and dependence in the past year. A drinker with alcohol
abuse and dependence is 3 times more valuable to the al-
cohol industry since such drinkers consume 3 times the
amount of alcohol that other drinkers consume.
With at least 37.5% of sales linked to underage drink-
ing and adult abusive and dependent drinking, the alco-
hol industry has a compelling financial motive to attempt
to maintain or increase rates of underage drinking. Alco-
holadvertisementsinmagazines,forexample,exposeyouth
aged 12 to 20 years to 45% more beer advertisements and
27% more advertisements for distilled spirits than adults
of legal drinking age.38-40 The same pattern of overexpo-
sure of children relative to adults with advertisements for
beer and distilled spirits also can be seen in radio and tele-
vision advertising.41,42 Furthermore, exposure of children
and teens to magazine and television alcohol advertise-
ments has increased, even more so for girls than boys, de-
spite national reports43-45 calling for limits on advertising
by the alcohol industry to children and teens younger than
21 years. Allegations that the alcohol industry profits from
unfair and deceptive marketing practices aimed at under-
age drinkers to assure this flow of profits is the subject of
several lawsuits filed against the alcohol industry.46-48
The financial interests of the alcohol industry appear to
be antithetic to the public health interests of the nation in
preventing and limiting pathological drinking. The public
health implications of this research are two-fold. First, be-
cause of this apparent conflict of interest, the alcohol in-
dustry is not a good candidate to regulate its own market-
ingandsalespractices,particularlyastheyrelatetounderage

ers (12.2% of youth aged 12-20 years) already met DSM-IV
criteria for abusive and dependent drinking underscores
the critical importance of comprehensive prevention strat-
egies and treatment options tailored to the needs of teens.
