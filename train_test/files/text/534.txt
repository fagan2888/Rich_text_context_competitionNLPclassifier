Objectives. The relationship of sleep to health has been an active area of research in recent years, and the National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) expanded sleep data collection in Wave 2 with enhanced core questions
and a novel sleep module that included an objective measure of sleep duration and quality.
Method. A randomly selected one-third of Wave 2 participants and their spouses or coresident partners were invited to
participate in the sleep module. Objective sleep data were collected using wrist actigraphy, an accelerometer that records
an integrated measure of motion over short epochs (15 s each). This information is stored and subsequently analyzed to
determine sleep and wake periods by epoch. Individuals were instructed to wear the actiwatches for 72hr. Several sleep
parameters were derived from the accelerometer. Individuals concurrently kept a sleep diary.
Results. Sleep actigraphy data were successfully collected from 780 individuals. Many of the survey-based and the
actigraph-estimated sleep parameters varied by age and gender. However, age and gender patterns often differed for sleep
characteristics that were both asked and measured, such as sleep duration.
Discussion. The survey and actigraphy data provide different information about sleep characteristics. The opportunity
to examine actigraph-estimated sleep characteristics in a nationally representative sample of older adults allows novel
analyses of the associations of sleep parameters with social and health data.
Key Words: Actigraphy--Sleep--Sleep duration--Sleep quality.
Sleep is a complicated behavior with multiple dimen-
sions that include timing, duration, consolidation,
depth, and restfulness. Sleep characteristics vary from
person to person (Lauderdale et al., 2006; Nunes et al.,
2008; Unruh et al., 2008), and complaints about difficulty
sleeping are common among older adults (Ancoli-Israel,
2003). Although it seems intuitively obvious that sleep is
essential to life, the physiological functions of sleep are not
fully understood; this has been an active area of research in
recent years (Siegel, 2005; Xie et al., 2013).
Sleep has not historically been one of the lifestyle risk fac-
tors routinely queried in population-based surveys and stud-
ies.Forexample,theannualNationalHealthInterviewSurvey
just added sleep questions to the coreAdult Health Behaviors
Section in 2004 (Schoenborn & Adams, 2010). However,
there were a few large epidemiologic cohorts that included
one or more survey questions about sleep prior to 2000, nota-
bly the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study
I and II, the Nurses' Health Study, and the First National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study (Ayas et al., 2003; Gangwisch, Malaspina,
Boden-Albala, & Heymsfield, 2005; Kripke, Garfinkel,
Wingard, Klauber, & Marler, 2002). Analyses from these
studies have found that survey-based sleep characteristics
correlate with many health outcomes, including mortality
(Cappuccio, D'Elia, Strazzullo, & Miller, 2010; Gallicchio
& Kalesan, 2009). Most sleep research in nonclinical popula-
tions has been laboratory-based and included small numbers
of volunteers. Such studies have identified potential mecha-
nisms that could explain some of the correlations found
between sleep and health in the cohort studies. For exam-
ple, laboratory-based experimental studies of younger adults
have indicated that there may be deleterious consequences
of inadequate sleep across multiple physiological domains,
including cognitive, metabolic, and immunologic (Faraut,
Boudjeltia, Vanhamme, & Kerkhofs, 2012; Van Cauter,
Spiegel, Tasali, & Leproult, 2008; Walker, 2008).
Wave 2 of National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project (NSHAP) added a novel sleep module that included
an objective measure of sleep as well as additional survey
questions; these are the first objective sleep data available
for a nationally representative sample of the population in
the United States. This paper will describe the survey ques-
tions about sleep in the Wave 1 and Wave 2 core interviews,
the measurements included in the sleep module in Wave 2,
and some suggestions for using them in analyses.

Wave 1 Sleep Data
Survey questions about sleep have most often assessed
quantity, quality, or general satisfaction, frequently posed
as "feeling rested" during the day. In the first wave of data
collection (2005­2006), the NSHAP asked about sleep with
four questions in the core survey. These questions were
asked of all participants. Sleep quantity was assessed with
the single question "How many hours do you usually sleep
at night?" and response options were in whole hours. Sleep
quality was included as part of the depression instrument, in
which respondents were asked about the frequency of sev-
eral conditions, including "My sleep was restless." Overall
satisfaction was assessed with the question "How often do
you feel really rested when you wake up in the morning?"
with four levels of response endorsement. Finally, in the
social relationships section, there was a question about how
often individuals with spouses or romantic partners slept in
the same bed as that person during the past month. Mean
reported sleep duration from the single question was just
under 7hr and did not vary greatly by age or sex (Table 1).
Only about 60% reported feeling rested in the morning most
of the time, and this also did not vary greatly by age or sex.
Relatively few, however, reported that sleep was restless
most of the time (12%), and this also did not vary strongly
by age or sex. The one sleep question with a strong age effect
in Wave 1 was sleeping with a partner, which decreased by
age, not only because fewer individuals had partners, but
also because those with partners were less likely to sleep
in the same bed. Data are publicly available (NSHAP Wave

Wave 2 Sleep Data
Survey Questions in the Core Data Collection
Growing interest in sleep as a chronic disease risk factor
contributed to a decision to enhance sleep data collection in
Wave 2 (2010­2011) of NSHAP. There were two types of
enhancements: (a) changes in the core sleep questions includ-
ing a different approach to querying typical sleep duration
and a few additional questions and (b) inclusion of a new
module, with an objective sleep measurement and sleep log,
offered to a randomly selected one-third of respondents and
their spouses or coresident partners. Data are publicly avail-
able (NSHAP Wave 2: Waite, Linda J., Kathleen Cagney,

The core sleep duration question was modified in
response to accumulating evidence that single questions
about usual sleep duration are not highly correlated or
well calibrated with measured sleep duration for older

adults, although self-reported duration does nonetheless
predict many health outcomes (Ananthakrishnan et al.,
2014; Gangwisch et al., 2006; Martínez-Gómez, Guallar-
Castillón, León-Muñoz, López-García, & Rodríguez-
Artalejo, 2013). Self-reported duration is typically longer
than sleep as measured by either actigraphy or polysom-
nography, and the correlation between self-reported dura-
tion and measured sleep is in the low to moderate range
(Patel, Blackwell, Ancoli-Israel, & Stone, 2012; Silva
et al., 2007; van den Berg et al., 2009). There is some evi-
dence of systematic biases in self-reported duration: for
example, those with more education have a higher corre-
lation between reported and measured sleep compared to
those with less education (Lauderdale, Knutson, Yan, Liu,
& Rathouz, 2008; Silva et al., 2007).
A few epidemiological cohorts of older adults have
recently added or included objective sleep measurements,
either actigraphy, which estimates sleep based on arm
motion, or polysomnography, which defines sleep based
on electrical activity in the brain recorded by an electro-
encephalogram (Blackwell et al., 2008; Nieto et al., 2000;
Patel et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2007). Neither is a
perfect measure of routine sleep behavior. They are imper-
fect because: (a) actigraphy measures a physical state that
is highly correlated with sleep but does not actually meas-
ure sleep and (b) polysomnography may alter sleep behav-
ior due to its intrusiveness and its need to be set up by a
technician.
There has been very little methodological work about how
best to ask about sleep duration to optimize validity and reli-
ability. This is likely because asking about sleep duration in
more than one way in the same interview causes respondents,
remembering their most recent answer, to be more consistent
in their subsequent answers than they might be if differently
worded questions were asked at different times. There are
understandable reasons why habitual sleep duration questions
may be challenging for individuals to answer. A valid answer
draws on several cognitive domains. First, individuals must
realize that they need to carry out a mental arithmetic prob-
lem in order to give an accurate answer. Then they need to
figure out the time when they typically fall asleep and when
they usually wake up--both of which may have great night-
to-night variability. Finally, they must hold those numbers in
mind and subtract in their head, a calculated difference that
often spans midnight. It seems likely that many older individ-
uals may have difficulty doing this or simply chose not to, and
instead respond with a number that seems plausible. In Wave
2, NSHAP removed two potentially problematic aspects of
the duration question: realizing it is an arithmetic problem and
mentally subtracting. Respondents were asked "What time
do you usually go to bed and start trying to fall asleep?" and
"What time do you usually wake up?" These questions were
asked separately for "weekdays or work days" and for "week-
ends, or days off." Individuals responded with clock time,
including hours, minutes, and a.m./p.m. The answers not only
allow the calculation of usual sleep duration by the analyst,

but also make it possible to consider the circadian timing of
usual sleep as an additional sleep characteristic.
The remaining three sleep questions from Wave 1 were
repeated in the Wave 2 core interview. There were also new
questions about sleep medications and naps in the Wave 2
core interview (Table 2). Average sleep duration calculated
from the usual bedtime and waketime questions for week-
nights and weekend nights (weighted 5/7 and 2/7) was 8.2hr;
this increased with age for men but not for women. Overall,
20% had taken sleep medications in the previous 2 weeks--
this was higher for women than men but did not vary with
age. A majority of respondents had taken at least one nap
during the past week, and the frequency of naps increased
with age.
The Sleep Module
A randomly selected one-third of the Wave 2 respond-
ents were invited to participate in the Sleep Module dur-
ing their in-home interview (Wave 1 respondents and their
spouses/partners were selected independently). Altogether,
808 individuals in the original sample and 309 spouses (or
coresident partners) were invited to participate; of these,
897 agreed to participate. The Module had two compo-
nents: 72
hr of wrist actigraphy and a "Sleep and Activity
Booklet." For those who agreed, a date was set for sleep
data collection and the booklet and actigraph, along with a
prepaid return mailer, were mailed out, usually a few days
after the in-home interview; 823 were successfully recon-
tacted and received the packet. The booklet had two parts:
additional questions about sleep and a 3-day sleep log to
be filled out concurrently with wearing the wrist actigraph.
Seven hundred and eighty-five booklets were ultimately
returned. Because the booklet was received a few days after
the interview, NSHAP had the opportunity to ask respond-
ents about sleep duration in two different ways without hav-
ing both in the same interview. The Wave 1 sleep duration
question was repeated in the Sleep and Activity Booklet:
"How many hours do you usually sleep at night?" There
were three additional sleep quality questions in the book-
let: (a) the frequency of having trouble falling asleep, (b)
waking up during the night, and (c) waking up too early
(Table 3). These questions have previously been used in
many studies, including the Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) and the
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). The mean sleep
hours reported in the booklet, using the same wording as the
Wave 1 core question was 7.5hr, which decreased with age
for women, but not for men. Women were more likely than
men to report having trouble falling asleep. With increasing
age, both men and women were more likely to report wak-
ing up during the night and waking up too early.
The booklet also contained a 3-day sleep log. For each of
the three 24-hr periods (within the 72hr) when the actigraph
was worn, individuals were asked to write down when they
started trying to fall asleep, when they awoke, whether
they napped and for how long (within categories; variables
described in Table 4).
Actigraphy
Wrist actigraphy data were collected using the Actiwatch
Spectrum model from Phillips Respironics; the manufac-
turer loaned Actiwatches to NSHAP for this study through
their grant review process. Actiwatches look like a digital
wristwatch, but they include a highly sensitive accelerometer

Assessment of Sleep in the NSHAP
that digitally records gross motor activity. Counts of activi-
ties are recorded within prespecified epochs (15-s epochs
were used for NSHAP). Upon return of the Actiwatch,
data were downloaded and analyzed using manufacturer-
developed and tested algorithms that estimate several
sleep parameters using the patterns of activity counts. This
Actiwatch Spectrum model includes additional features:
measures of ambient and colored light and a detector of
when the Actiwatch is on the wrist. There have been many
validation studies of individuals concurrently wearing an
actigraph (various manufacturers and models) and under-
going polysomnography. However, most of these studies
only included a small number of subjects, often fewer than
20, and focused on either a clinical population or a much
younger population. There have been several review arti-
cles about the validation studies (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003;
Sadeh & Acebo, 2002; Van de Water, Holmes, & Hurley,
2011). Ancoli-Israel and colleagues (2003) concluded that
the overall correlation in sleep duration for adults is about
90%. Van de Water and coworkers (2011) pointed out that
the accuracy of actigraphy, compared with polysomnogra-
phy, depended on the sleep variable, the manufacturer of the
device and the study population. Among the few studies of
older, community-dwelling adults, a study of 36 postmeno-
pausal women reported correlations over 0.9 for total sleep
timeandsleepefficiency(Jean-Louis,Kripke,Cole,Assmus,
& Langer, 2001). More recently, a very large study of older
men compared different actigraphy scoring algorithms to
polysomnography and found only moderate correlations
for the best of the algorithms (Blackwell, Ancoli-Israel,
Redline, Stone, & Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS)
Study Group, 2011). In general, actigraphy overestimates
sleep relative to polysomnography, as still awake time tends
to be scored as sleep. In addition, Phillips Respironics has
compiled a bibliography of validation studies using their
models (accessed on 18 December, 2012, from http://www.
healthcare.philips.com/us_en/homehealth/sleep/actiwatch/
default.wpd). Details about the Actiware 5.5 software are
available from http://www.learnactiware.com/tutorials/ and
the user manual is available online at www.camntech.com/
files/The_Actiwatch_User_Manual_V7.2.pdf.
Individuals were asked to wear theActiwatch for 72hr; the
Actiwatch records the time and date. The devices were sent
out on all weekdays, and the participants were asked to start
wearing the watch the day they received it, which was always
a weekday because of the type of delivery. The model also
includes an event marker and participants were asked to push
it both when they started trying to fall asleep each night and
when they awoke fully for the day. The event marker leaves
a time stamp but does not affect recording, which was set to
begin automatically during the morning of the day when the
participant received the instrument and record continuously
thereafter.The actigraphy data may be fully analyzed whether
or not the event marker was pressed; the event markers supply
additional information about the individual's sleep-related
behavior. Six hundred and fifty-five individuals remembered
to use the event marker at the beginning and 674 remem-
bered to use it at the end of at least one night. Some analyses
may need to be restricted to nights with event markers. For
example, an analysis of sleep latency would be restricted to
nights with an evening event marker, whereas an analysis
of consistency of bedtime might be restricted to individuals
with all three evening event markers. The main rest interval
(which contains not only the sleep interval but also the time
spent falling asleep and waking up) for each individual was
first set by the manufacturer's software to capture the long-
est sleep interval each day, based on the activity pattern. The
rest intervals were then manually reexamined and reset if the
interval set by the software failed to fully include the longest
sleep interval, defined by the activity pattern. For example,
the software sometimes only included part of the night when
there was a long awake episode during the night. Additional
data used for setting the rest interval were the event marker
and the light level, which typically indicated when the lights
were turned off. When present, the event marker was pri-
oritized unless it was inconsistent with the other pieces of
evidence, because it appeared that individuals occasionally
forgot to press the event marker and then thought to press it if
they awoke during the night.
Actigraphy Results
Actigraphs with data were returned by 793 individu-
als. However, for 13 of them, the data could not be used to
determine sleep statistics, for reasons such as no discernable
rest interval, resulting in usable data from 780 individuals.
Primary respondents had birth years 1920­1947 and were

whereas the 227 spouses ranged in age from 36 to 91. The

ents and the spouses/partners whose birth years were in

For the small number of individuals with fewer than three

teristics are given in Table 5, and the averages for the sleep
characteristics included in the public release data are given
in Table 6. The public use file also includes the nightly data.
Several variables are based on the definition of each epoch
as sleep or not, which is a function of the activity count in
that epoch and surrounding epochs. "Assumed sleep" is the
length of the interval that begins with the first epoch scored
as "sleep" in the major sleep interval and ends with the last
epoch scored as "sleep." "Actual sleep" is the total duration
of the epochs scored as sleep within the assumed sleep inter-
val. Wake after sleep onset, referred to as WASO, is the total
minutes awake during the assumed sleep interval. "Percent
sleep" is the percent of the assumed sleep interval that is
actual sleep. Additional variables are the clock times at the
beginning and end of the assumed sleep interval, the day of
the week of each sleep interval and the fragmentation index.
Fragmentation is an indicator of sleep disruption and is the
sum of two percentages: the percentage of the sleep interval
spent moving and the percentage of immobile periods (i.e.,
contiguous epochs with no movement) that are no more than
one minute long. Although there is no clear definition of
what "sleep quality" is, WASO, fragmentation, and percent
sleep are each thought of as quality indicators.
For the full sample of individuals with birth years 1920­
1947, the average assumed sleep was 7.9
hr (Table 6). This
was higher for women than men and there was a slight trend
toward longer assumed sleep with increasing age.Actual sleep
averaged 7.3
hr, and this increased with age for men but not
for women, with the mean being higher for women than men
at younger ages but similar in the oldest age group. WASO
averaged 39min, and this increased with age for men but not
for women. The mean fragmentation index was higher for
men than women in each age group and increased with age for
men. Percent sleep averaged 82% overall and decreased with
age for both men and women. Figure 1 shows the distribu-
tion of actigraphy-estimated average sleep durations ("actual
sleep") by hours of self-reported sleep (from the single ques-
tion "How many hours do you usually sleep at night?"). This
graph shows that there is not a high correlation between the
self-reported and actigraph-estimated durations.
Discussion
NSHAP greatly expanded the opportunities to investigate
hypotheses related to sleep in the Wave 2 data collection.

Assessment of Sleep in the NSHAP
A few additional questions were added to the Wave 2 core
questionnaire, but the more important additions were in the
randomly selected one-third sleep module that successfully
collected an objective measure of sleep, wrist actigraphy. The
sleep module also included a 3-day sleep log and several addi-
tional survey questions. There is, however, no perfect way to
measure sleep, and the actigraphy-derived variables should be
thought of as estimates of sleep parameters. Because NSHAP
also collected survey-based sleep characteristics, the data pro-
vide diverse opportunities to compare both ways of measuring
sleep characteristics and examine how each relates to social
factors, biomarkers, and health. Finding differences between
survey responses and an objective measure is not unique to
sleep: Differences have similarly been found between self-
reported physical disabilities and performance-based meas-
ures, with both independently predicting short-term mortality
and nursing home admission (Guralnik et al., 1994).
There are important limitations to the actigraphy data.
We only collected data during a 72-hr interval based on
concerns that compliance would suffer with a longer pro-
tocol. Given the amount of day-to-day variability in sleep,
a longer interval would provide a better estimate of the
individual's underlying mean and also permit additional
within-respondent analyses of variability (Rowe et al.,
2008). However, 3-day data collection is probably less of
a limitation in this mostly retired population than among
younger, working adults. For example, we did not find any
evidence of a day-of-the-week effect, which is usually seen
in working age or school age populations. Another limita-
tion is that the data do not support the calculation of sleep
latency for all individuals and all nights. Sleep latency is
the amount of time it takes an individual to fall asleep ini-
tially after she or he begins to try falling asleep. It is dif-
ficult to determine when an individual began trying to fall
asleep unless the event marker was used, which was only
true 84% of the nights. Finally, while there are 195 couples
where both partners provided actigraphy data but the data
were not collected contemporaneously, thereby preclud-
ing an hour-by-hour analysis of how one partner's sleep or
sleep quality affects the other. This was done to avoid the
possibility of the actiwatches being inadvertently switched
were they sent to both members of a couple at the same
time.
Suggestions for Analysis
The public use actigraphy data file includes the day of the
week for each for the three nights.
For each night, there are five variables derived from
actigraphy, listed in Table 5, which also includes the cor-
responding variable name. In addition, the sleep log bed-
time and waketime are included for each night, both on a
1,440min basis beginning at noon (log_bed and log_wake).
Finally, there is a nap variable for each day (log_nap).
Most analyses will want to use the mean values across
nights, although estimates of variability across the three
nights may also be of interest. Caution should be used when
including more than one of the actigraph sleep variables
in the same statistical model because they are all interre-
lated and almost all are strongly correlated with each other.
Specifically, note that acti_sleep and waso sum to assumed_
sleep, and that percent_sleep is the ratio of acti_sleep and
assumed_sleep.

as small circles. These data are unweighted.

Lauderdale et al.
Analysis of changes in sleep quantity and quality from
Wave 1 to Wave 2 are limited by the changes in how the
sleep data were collected, and the relative paucity of sleep
questions in Wave 1. Comparisons of the three questions
asked identically in the two waves are straightforward.
However, comparisons of self-reported sleep hours across
waves are necessarily limited because the duration data
were collected differently in the Wave 2 core. Investigators
may want to consider whether a crosswalk can be developed
between the single question and the sleep duration derived
from the usual bedtime/waketime questions in the Wave 2
core by investigating the responses to the single question in
the Sleep and Activity Booklet for in Wave 2.
The enhanced sleep data in Wave 2 of NSHAP, com-
bined with the rich survey and biomarker data, should allow
researchers to advance our knowledge of how objective and
survey-based measures of sleep relate to health and aging.

Key Points
·
· In Wave 1, sleep data are limited to four survey
questions.
·
· In Wave 2, sleep data collection was enhanced for all
respondents in two ways: one way, by including addi-
tional questions about naps and sleep medications and
another way, by using a different method to determine
usual sleep duration--separately querying usual bed-
times and waking times--which may be more precise
and less subject to reporting bias.
·
· A modularized sleep substudy in Wave 2, in which
785 of the Wave 2 respondents participated, included
a 3-day sleep log, additional survey questions used in
other population-based studies of older individuals,
and an objective sleep measure, wrist actigraphy.
·
· Wrist actigraphy provides three nights of data that
give several estimated sleep characteristics about
duration and sleep quality.
