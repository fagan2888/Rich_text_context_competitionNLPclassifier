"The Syrian flag has two stars, one expresses Syria
and the other Egypt" ­ Tweet by Egyptian activist, Wael
Ghoneim, 25 March 2011.
Between December 2010 and March 2011 a local Tunisian
protest against an aging dictator spread to Egypt and then to
Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and Syria and at a lower intensity
to several other countries (Lynch, 2012). These protests
involved a remarkable number of commonalities in slo-
gans, timing, and methods, and self-conscious framing of
events as a common "Arab" narrative. Yemeni protestors,
for instance, quickly adopted Egyptian slogans or took
heart from Libyan opposition advances. This Arab uprising
represents a critical case for theories of the international
diffusion of protest movements and regime change (Bunce
and Wolchik 2011; Hale, 2013; Solingen, 2012; Zhukov
and Stewart, 2013).
The early Syrian uprising modeled itself after counterparts
across the region, employing similar rhetorical frames,
attempting to seize public places without arms, presenting a
civic, non-sectarian and non-Islamist face at home and abroad,
and in some cases hoping to attract a NATO intervention like
Libya's. Many likely expected Bashar al-Asad's regime to
succumb to a similar fate as those of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak
and Tunisia's Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali (Anden-Papadopolous
and Pantti, 2013; Leenders, 2012; Leenders and Heydemann,
2012).As Syria's conflict evolved towards a mixture of protest
and civil war, while uprisings in Arab Spring leaders such as
Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen themselves struggled, Syria
became far more of a polarizing issue with a higher degree of
sectarian rather than pan-Arab identity narratives.
How did Syria's popular uprising of 2011 fit within the
broader regional wave of Arab uprisings in early 2011,
commonly termed the "Arab Spring"? Existing theories of
protest diffusion and regime change cascades emphasize
the importance of geographic proximity. The pattern of
uprisings in Arab countries in early 2011 only partially fits
Syria in the Arab Spring: The integration
of Syria's conflict with the Arab uprisings,
2011­2013

Abstract
How did Syria's conflict interact with the broader wave of regional protest known as the Arab Spring? This article uses a
unique, complete Twitter dataset of tweets including the word "Syria" in English or Arabic to empirically test how Syria's
conflict was discussed online. The analysis shows a high level of interaction between Syria and other Arab countries
through 2011. Other Arab countries experiencing popular protests ("Arab Spring countries") were referenced far more
often in 2011 than were Syria's immediate neighbors, while keyword analysis shows the framing of the conflict in terms
of Syria's "regime" aligned the conflict with other Arab uprisings. In 2012­2013 this changed sharply, with significantly
fewer mentions of other Arab countries, particularly Arab Spring countries, more fundraising and political appeals across
the Gulf, and growing Islamization. These findings offer one of the first empirical demonstrations of the integration and
disintegration of a unified Arab discourse from 2011 to 2013, with significant implications for theories of the diffusion of
protest and ideas.

these models, however. While Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya
may be physically connected, they are far from Yemen,
Bahrain, and Syria. The regional nature of the Arab upris-
ings has been explained in part by the unusually intense
degree of transnational linkages and a highly unified Arab
public sphere, which facilitated diffusion of ideas, meth-
ods, and actions from one country to the next (Lynch, 2011,
2012). That shared space facilitated the spread of expecta-
tions of the possibility of victory, the sharing of repertoires
of contention such as the tactic of seizing and holding a
central square, and the replication of slogans such as "the
people demand the downfall of the regime."
Current theories of international diffusion have not fully
considered the differences between the Arab uprisings and
previous regional waves of protest, while most accounts of
the Arab uprisings have simply assumed Syria's place
within this broadly integrated, intensely interconnected
Arab public sphere. This article uses a unique Twitter data-
set of all tweets over 2 months that include the word "Syria"
in Arabic or English, to present new empirical evidence
both for theories of international diffusion and for prevalent
explanations of Syria's conflict and the broader Arab
uprising.
The findings suggest that Syria was deeply embedded
within a relatively integrated Arab public sphere during
most of 2011. For the first six months of the conflict,
35­45% of the tweets that mention Syria also mention at
least one other Arab country and 10­15% mention more
than one. What is more, attention in these early days
reflected shared experience of protest far more than it did
geographic proximity. Countries undergoing their own
protest movements were far more likely to be mentioned
in this early phase than were countries close to Syria or
regionally powerful countries such as Saudi Arabia and
Qatar. In 2012, this changed dramatically, online and on
the ground. Far fewer Syria tweets mentioned other Arab
countries, with those that did more likely to mention
neighbors immediately affected by the fighting. As peace-
ful protest gave way to insurgency and civil war, Syria
became less "Arab springy" and more of a sectarian,
transnational civil war with primary impact on its geo-
graphical neighbors.
This evidence challenges and expands upon recent argu-
ments about the socially constructed nature of "diffusion"
(Mekouar, 2014; Solingen, 2012; Zhukov and Stewart,
2013). Where earlier literature highlights the importance of
geographic proximity in regime change cascades and pro-
test diffusion, Arab Spring cases such as Tunisia, Libya,
Egypt, Yemen, and Bahrain were physically distant from
Syria (Bunce and Wolchick, 2011; Saideman 2012). The
Arab countries which occupied the same discursive space
as Syria in 2011, and from which Syrian activists borrowed
protest slogans and methods, were neither its neighbors nor
traditional allies or rivals, but rather other Arab countries
experiencing large-scale protest. Geographical proximity
still matters, of course, but so do socially-constructed iden-
tities framed within distinctive public sphere networks.
Diffusion and identity framing
The high degree of regional media and social media inte-
gration arguably helped to create the conditions for the
international diffusion of revolutionary protest, culminating
in a regime change cascade (Hale, 2013; Hussain and
Howard, 2013; Patel et al., 2014; Weyland, 2012). The key
mechanism explored here is scale shift, the linking together
of disparate local struggles into a single master frame which
allows protest forms to become "modular" (Beissinger
2007; Hale, 2013) that is, applied similarly in otherwise dif-
ferent contexts. We address the prior question: to what
extent was there such a common media and publicly articu-
lated shared identity in the first place?
Evidence that Syria's protestors paid close attention to
physically distant Arab uprisings has implications for
theories of diffusion beyond the Middle East. A tightly
interlinked media environment would help to explain the
particular potency of demonstration effects in the early
Arab uprisings. The articulation of a shared identity
within that media is also important, however, as individu-
als will more likely be inspired by protests in a foreign
land if they have bought in to the notion that protestors
there were "just like me" and engaged in a shared strug-
gle (Lohmann, 1994). As Beissinger puts it, "modular
phenomena are made possible by a sense of interconnect-
edness across cases produced by common institutional
characteristics, histories, cultural affinities, or modes of
domination, allowing agents to make analogies across
cases and to read relevance into developments in other
contexts" (Beissinger, 2007: 263). The linking together
of multiple countries in a tweet is a concrete manifesta-
tion of this construction of a shared identity and shifting
of scale. When individuals tweet "injustice is injustice
whether in Bahrain or Libya or Syria" (@salmaeldaly,
March 2011) or "#daraa of #syria is #sidibouzid of #tuni-
sia and #suez of #egypt" (@drsonnet, March 2011), they
are explicitly constructing such a sense of shared struggle
and shared fate.
The construction of identity in terms of a shared popular
uprising rather than physical proximity or political similar-
ity points to the importance of problematizing the defini-
tion of "proximity" for the purposes of studying diffusion
(Bunce and Wolchik, 2011; Zhukov and Stewart, 2013). In
the early Arab Spring, Egypt and Tunisia were "closer" to
Syria than were its immediate neighbors because of the
shared experience of a popular uprising. In 2012 Kuwait
became "closer" to Syria through the mobilization of public
support in Kuwaiti civil society, and in 2013 Iraq became
"closer" not because the physical distance between the two
countries had changed but because its insurgency fused
with parts of the Syrian insurgency. Our analysis of tweets
Lynch et al. 3
offers one empirically observable manifestation of these
changes.
Methodology
Social media has been used increasingly as a source of data
for examining questions such as these (Bruns et al., 2013;
Lotan et al., 2011; Lynch et al., 2014; Hussain and Howard,
2013; McGarty et al., 2013; Starbird and Pale, 2012;
Tufekci, 2014). The high volume of real time sharing of
information and expression of personal opinions creates an
unprecedented public archive. The Syrian conflict has been
perhaps the most socially-mediated civil war in history,
with little direct journalistic access to the battlefield and an
extraordinary amount of user-generated content shared
across social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter
(Lynch et al., 2014). These tweets do many things simulta-
neously: they share information and frame it within a par-
ticular narrative context through self-selected networks,
they can be used to condemn or praise, to express solidarity,
and to argue and disrupt ongoing conversations (Tufekci,
2014). In this paper we are primarily interested in using
large-scale analysis of these tweets as a window into public
discourse.
Our analysis is based on a complete dataset of every
tweet including the word "Syria" in Arabic or English
between March 2011 and July 2013. The dataset, which we
purchased from the certified Twitter data vendor, Topsy,
includes all public tweets posted in those months ­ totaling
over 5 million tweets and almost 7 million unique users. We
avoided using hashtags or selecting key users in construct-
ing this dataset in order to avoid the inevitable distortions
of selecting on a dependent variable (Tufekci, 2014). It is
worth noting that the use of "Syria" likely means that tweets
from inside Syria itself are underrepresented (i.e. in a long
debate about a protest in Aleppo, the word Syria might not
be used).
Our analysis includes all tweets that were re-tweeted at
least five times, in order to focus on tweets which passed a
minimum threshold of attention. We further focused the
analysis by drawing tweets from a subset of the dataset's
largest densely-connected network communities. We did
this to increase the possibility that the tweets we examined
would come from, and be raised to prominence by, indi-
viduals with a vested interest in Syria and its affairs. This
produced a dataset of 608,026 unique tweets re-tweeted
12,509,706 times (which makes up 22% of the total data-
set) and 120,968 unique users.
We then extracted every mention in Arabic and English
of 14 different Arab countries which appeared in a tweet
containing Syria. We calculated how many tweets each
month contained one, two, three, four, or more other Arab
countries, and how frequently those tweets were re-tweeted.
This gives us an index of "Arab Springness" which tells us
the extent to which tweets on Syria were linked to countries
outside its borders. We posit that higher numbers of tweets
containing one or more other Arab countries in addition to
Syria represent higher degrees of regional interconnection
and shared identification, which in turn are conducive to
scale shift and diffusion across borders.
Which countries were mentioned alongside Syria mat-
ters as much as does the volume of co-mentions. We there-
fore grouped the 14 Arab countries into baskets of similar
states. First, we created a basket of the five "Arab Spring"
states in which a major protest movement took place
between January and March 2011: Bahrain, Egypt, Libya,
Tunisia, and Yemen. None of these countries have particu-
larly close economic, political, or cultural relations with
Syria, and none directly neighbor it. They are in physically
different parts of the Middle East, have different levels of
wealth, different political systems, and different sectarian
compositions. The only thing which unites these five coun-
tries is that they experienced a major uprising in this time
frame which overthrew or came close to overthrowing an
entrenched autocratic regime.
We also broke out a group of Syria's neighbors.
Conveniently for the purposes of analysis, none of these
neighbors (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon) experienced a major pro-
test movement, but each had close political, demographic,
and cultural interactions with Syria. The dataset also
includes Morocco, a distant Arab country which did not
have a major "Arab Spring" uprising, and Oman, a Gulf
state which did not play a major role in Syria. Neither
receives any appreciable level of attention, which provides
a useful validity check on the assumed significance of the
Twitter mentions. Finally, we included Palestine, which did
not have major mobilization and was only marginally
affected by the war during the time period covered here, but
which traditionally occupies a central place in Arab politi-
cal discourse and would ­ all else equal ­ be expected to
figure prominently in any regional discussion.
We coded the incidence of several key words in English
and Arabic within the top 5,000 most re-tweeted tweets each
month as a proxy for the prevalence of particular identity
frames (Petchler and Gonzalez-Bailon, 2014). We employed
a simple lexicon approach, searching in English and Arabic
for the terms "regime" (a term often used by those sympa-
thetic with the Syrian opposition, which resonates well with
the discourse of the otherArab uprising cases), "donate/dona-
tion" (a term which we determined inductively captures a
wide swathe of the public fundraising efforts on behalf of the
Syrian opposition), and "jihad" (a term which captures at
least some of the Islamist framing of the conflict).
Findings
The data demonstrate clearly a high degree of "Arab
Springness" during the six months following the outbreak
of Syria's uprising in March 2011, and the sharp decline of
that integration in the following 18 months.
4 Research and Politics 
During 2011, roughly 30% of "Syria" unique tweets
included at least one other Arab country (and 32% of all
re-tweets), while 8% of unique tweets and of all re-tweets
named two or more (see Figure 1). In August 2011, when
the overall number of tweets containing the word "Syria" in
English or Arabic nearly quadrupled from the previous
month, this shot up to 37% naming at least one other Arab
country and 12% naming at least two. This "Arab
Springness" reached a peak of 41.5% naming one country
and 15.5% naming two in November 2011. And the coun-
tries named were not randomly selected. Figure 2 shows
that the five "Arab Spring" countries dominated the men-
tions during 2011, with Arab spring countries appearing in
no fewer than 20% of all tweets in any month. That
exceeded 30% in each month between August and
November 2011. By contrast, Syria's immediate neighbors

Figure 2. Mentions of all "Arab Spring" countries as percentage of all tweets.
Lynch et al. 5
did not appear in more than 5% of tweets in any month in
this time period except for September, when the proportion
reached 10%.
Our analysis of keywords also matches this pattern. As
Figure 3 demonstrates, the tweets in this period sharply
focused on the "regime." The "regime" frame consciously
mirrors the communicative strategy and framing of opposi-
tions across the Arab world. "The people want to overthrow
the regime" was the definitive slogan of the early Arab
uprisings, shouted from Tunis to Cairo to Sanaa. Tweets
such as "these leaders in libya, syria and yemen didn't learn
the lesson: if your people's blood has flown your end is
near!" by Egyptian businessman @naguibsawiris (April
2011, in English) or "Libya, Yemen, Syria ... all deserve
justice and security together ... and all the Muslim lands"
by Saudi media figure @ahmadalshugairi (April 2011, in
Arabic) were common. Opposition activists tried to keep a
tight focus on the depredations and illegitimacy of the
regime while sustaining the momentum towards an inevita-
ble denouement of regime change. "Jihad" barely appears
at all during 2011, in line with the framing of the struggle as
a civic uprising against an autocratic regime.
Syria's "Arab Springness" did not last, however.
Figures 1, 2, and 3 collectively show how "Arab
Springness" declined as the Syrian struggle evolved from
a civic uprising into civil war and insurgency.
After 2011, "more than two" never exceeds 10% again.
"One" hovers around 20% of all tweets, still a respectable
figure which suggests a continuing high level of bilateral
engagement with Syria. The switch from "Arab Spring"
countries to "Neighbors" (Figure 2) further reveals this
shift. After January 2012, "Arab Spring" never breaks
10%, while "Neighbors" does so multiple times. The
decline in "Arab Springness" coincides with the sharp
increase in violence in the country and the growing shift
towards armed resistance. The "regime" framing preferred
by the mainstream Syrian opposition did not disappear, but
it did fall in salience compared to sectarian and religious
identity framing.
The tweets in the first eight months of 2012 reveal a
major spike in the mention of "donations," the keyword we
chose as a proxy for the massive public fundraising and
political support campaigns which gained steam across the
Gulf in this period. The shift towards "donations" reflects
the shift in focus by outside communities, and their grow-
ing role in funding and supporting armed groups rather
than simply sharing information and expressing support.
Tweets by prominent religious personalities such as @
nabilalawadhy, @tareqsuwaidan, and @salman_odah
bemoaning the fate of fellow Muslims and offering details
on phone numbers, locations, and times for charitable
campaigns commonly received thousands of re-tweets.
These campaigns were often tied to specific Syrian fac-
tions and fighting groups, creating organic links between
geographically distant parts of the Middle East. This was a
very different type of identity construction, however:
instead of identifying with the process of uprising and non-
violent regime change, online strategies now identified
with sectarian identities and particular groups within the
complex insurgency.
By 2013, "jihad" grew rapidly in prevalence, reflecting
the increasingly Islamized and radicalized nature of the
Syria discourse. The dramatic spike over the summer of
2013 in Figure 3 matches the overall shift in tenor in
regional discourse on the conflict. The rise of powerful
groups such as Jubhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq
and al-Sham (ISIS) depended heavily on funding and fight-
ers from outside of Syria. Tweets including appeals for
Muslims to join the jihad, videos of their accomplishments,
and intra-jihadist arguments increased significantly. More
broadly, discussion of Syria took on a palpably more sectar-
ian and radical tone.
Figure 3. Keywords: "Regime," "Jihad," and "Donation".
6 Research and Politics 
Several individual countries are worth highlighting.
Kuwait emerged as perhaps the most heavily invested
country in the Syria debate. Kuwait hosted by far the largest
concentration of fundraising and consciousness- raising
campaigns, both online and offline. Parliamentarians such
as Hajjaj al-Ajmi, Shafi Al-Ajmi, and Walid al-Tabtabie,
and religious entrepreneurs such as Nabil al-Awadhy,
gained enormous popularity for their exploits on behalf of
the Syrian rebels, while raising enormous sums of money.
The word "Kuwait" did not appear as often as might be
expected given this reality on the ground. We speculate that
this is because the fundraising campaigns were presented as
pan-Arab and Sunni rather than as national, and consciously
sought contributions from other Gulf states with tighter
controls over charities and finances (Dickinson, 2013).
Bahrain's unusual identity politics, with a Shi'a majority
repressed by a Sunni monarch, gave its Syria discourse a
very different quality. In the early Arab Spring, Bahrain's
protests were broadly seen through the frame of an Arab
uprising, a mobilized Arab population challenging an auto-
cratic regime. The Bahraini regime and its regional back-
ers, particularly in Saudi Arabia, instead defined the
struggle as one between a legitimate Sunni king and an
Iranian-backed Shi'ite subversion campaign. As that dis-
course took hold, and as the Syria conflict became increas-
ingly sectarianized, Bahrain "flipped" discursively, with its
Shi'a citizens now cast as equivalent to the Syrian Alawi
community and Hezbollah. The nature of Bahrain/Syria
tweets therefore varies significantly from what is seen in
the Sunni-majority Gulf states such as Kuwait, Qatar, and
Saudi Arabia. Bahrain's mentions plummeted from 10.3%
in 2011, to 5.9% in January­September 2012, to 2.1% in
October 2012­July 2013. This shows how a protest which
had once been part of the "Arab Spring" came to be seen as
"not like us" due to its Shi'ite majority, and thus phased out
of the identity-shaped discourse. As one angry Bahraini
tweeted: "Syria: popular mobilization/Libya: popular
mobilization/Egypt: popular mobilization/Tunisia: popular
mobilization/Yemen: popular mobilization/Bahrain and
Qatif? Foreign Intervention" (@m_abdali, October 2011,
translated from Arabic).
What about "Palestine," traditionally that central issue
of Arab political discourse? Interestingly, during 2011,
peak Arab Spring, Palestine appeared in only 1.2% of all
Syria tweets ­ far fewer than Bahrain (10.3%), and fewer
even than Tunisia (2%). Palestine was not a primary refer-
ence point on Syria, compared to other Arab Spring coun-
tries. One of the most popular tweets mentioning Palestine
referred to the failure of the outside world to help: "Syria
shouted, where are the Arabs? And Palestine laughed." In
certain key months, however, Palestine did surge into the
Syria debate; only Kuwait and Bahrain were mentioned
more frequently in May 2012 (when Palestine was men-
tioned in 3% of tweets), no other country was mentioned
more frequently in November 2012 (7%), and only Iraq
was mentioned more often in July 2013 (3.7%). This sug-
gested the enduring, if latent, salience of the Palestine issue
for mobilization at key moments, as became strikingly
clear in July 2014 when it quickly came to dominate online
Arab political discourse war broke out between Israel and
Hamas.
Implications
This analysis offers strong support for the rise and fall of
the Arab Spring frame for the Syrian uprising. The findings
show clearly the intense identification and interaction
which underlay the diffusion of protest across borders for
most of 2011. "Arab Spring" countries, not more obvious
candidates such as geographical neighbors or the Palestinian
conflict, were the primary point of reference for these
online discussions. This intense interconnectedness lasted
less than a year, however, and then sharply plummeted. The
"Arab Spring" lens was replaced by both a regional sectar-
ian and Islamist narrative, and by a focus on the immediate
neighbors most affected by the conflict. The Gulf states
became a particularly intense site of online discussion
about Syria.
These findings document empirically the interconnected
Arab Spring online. These findings matter for our thinking
about the diffusion of protests and ideas, the social construc-
tion of proximity, and the life-cycle of protest waves. The
evidence that expectations, ideas, and protest movements
traveled between fellow "Arab Spring" countries even when
not physically proximate suggests the need to include iden-
tity within theories of international diffusion. Much more
needs to be done with the sprawling wealth of online data
relevant to the Arab public sphere, including rigorous analy-
sis of network clustering and the transmission of informa-
tion. Our index of joint mentions is only one potential
indicator of identification and attention, and could be sup-
plemented with more intensive content analysis. More needs
to be done to identify the specific mechanisms by which
these changes took place, including potentially exogenous
factors. Egyptians, Libyans, or Tunisians might, for instance,
have become preoccupied with their own struggles at home
and dropped out of the Syria conversation. The online data
might also be supplemented with comparative evidence in
the broadcast media. Taken together, this analysis should sig-
nificantly advance the empirical basis for evaluating theories
of international diffusion.
