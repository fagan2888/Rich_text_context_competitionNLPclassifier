OBJECTIVEdThe influence on diabetes of the timing and duration of obesity across the high-
risk period of adolescence to young adulthood has not been investigated in a population-based,
ethnically diverse sample.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA cohort of 10,481 individuals aged 12­21
years enrolled in the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1996) was followed
over two visits during young adulthood (18­27 years, 2001­2002; 24­33 years, 2007­2009).
Separate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of diabetes (A1C
$6.5% or diagnosis by a health care provider) in young adulthood with 1) obesity timing (never
obese, onset ,16 years, onset 16 to ,18 years, onset $18 years) and 2) obesity duration over
time (never obese, incident obesity, fluctuating obesity, and persistent obesity), testing differ-
ences by sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTSdAmong 24- to 33-year-old participants, 4.4% had diabetes (approximately half
were undiagnosed), with a higher prevalence in blacks and Hispanics than whites. In multivari-
able analyses, women who became obese before age 16 were more likely to have diabetes than
women who became obese at or after age 18 (odds ratio 2.77 [95% CI 1.39­5.52]), even after
accounting for current BMI, waist circumference, and age at menarche. Persistent (vs. adult
onset) obesity was associated with increased likelihood of diabetes in men (2.27 [1.41­3.64])
and women (2.08 [1.34­3.24]).
CONCLUSIONSdDiabetes risk is particularly high in individuals who were obese as ado-
lescents relative to those with adult-onset obesity, thus highlighting the need for diabetes pre-
vention efforts to address pediatric obesity.
Diabetes Care 36:865­872, 2013
Diabetes prevalence has risen sub-
stantially over the last few decades,
disproportionately affecting racial/
ethnic minorities (1,2). In 2007, 24 mil-
lion Americans had diabetes; nearly 6
million were undiagnosed (3). The total
cost of diabetes in 2007 was estimated
to be $174 billion (4), and this economic
burden is likely to escalate over time. The
adverse health and economic consequen-
ces combined with significant racial/
ethnic disparities and high rates of undi-
agnosed diabetes emphasize the critical
need to address this disease.
Although the links between current
obesity and type 2 diabetes are clear, some
research suggests that a history of obesity
during childhood (5,6) and young adult-
hood (7) increases diabetes risk later in
life. However, the differential and cumu-
lative effects of obesity during different
periods of the life span on the develop-
ment of diabetes are not well documen-
ted. In particular, adolescence may be a
sensitive period for the development of
diabetes given the substantial decreases
in insulin sensitivity associated with pu-
bertal development (8). This period has
the potential for alterations in insulin me-
tabolism, which might increase diabetes
risk later in life, and there is the potential
that a longer duration of obesity might
elicit additional metabolic changes that
increase future diabetes risk (9,10).
With obesity, pancreatic b-cells initially
increase insulin release to overcome the
reduced efficiency of insulin action, al-
though over time compensation may be-
come insufficient, ultimately leading to
the development of diabetes (9,10). Nev-
ertheless, epidemiologic research specifi-
cally examining the relationship between
duration of obesity with diabetes in adult-
hood has yielded inconsistent results
(11­16). A better understanding of the
relationship of obesity timing and dura-
tion to diabetes in adulthood is needed to
determine important periods for diabetes
intervention, particularly in diverse eth-
nic groups.
In this article, we use nationally
representative, longitudinal data to ex-
amine racial/ethnic differences in rates of
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in
young adults. In addition, we capitalize
upon longitudinal data to examine how
adolescent-onset obesity and adult-onset
obesity might differentially relate to di-
abetes risk in young adulthood and
whether these associations differ by sex
and race/ethnicity. We hypothesize that
individuals who experienced adolescent-
(vs. adult onset) obesity would be more
likely to have diabetes in young adulthood,
independent of current body size, with the
highest risk among those with persistent
obesity from the teen to adult years.

without a longitudinal sampling weight
(n = 801), which was needed to correct
for nonresponse bias and sample design
(18), ultimately resulting in 14,800 eligi-
ble individuals. In addition, we excluded
Native Americans (n = 59) because of the
small sample size and individuals who

Data provided as percentages or means (SEs). All results were weighted for national representation, and the SEs were corrected for multiple stages of cluster sample
design and unequal probability of selection. Diabetes status obtained in adulthood (wave IV). *Diagnosed diabetes defined as self-reported health care provider
diagnosis of diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes defined as A1C $6.5% with no report of a diabetes diagnosis. Percentages of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes do
not sum to percentage of total diabetes because of rounding. Timing of obesity was determined using the individual's age at the wave of initial obesity classification
and categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) adolescent obesity (defined as initial classification of obesity before 16 years of age); 3) adolescent obesity (between 16
and 18 years of age); and 4) adult obesity (obesity onset at or after 18 years of age). Obesity duration from adolescence to adulthood was based on obesity status
at waves II, III, and IV and categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (nonobese at baseline and became and remained obese through last examination);
3) fluctuating obesity (any shift in classification from obese to nonobese); and 4) persistent obesity (obese at all waves). xOf the participants, 256 women had missing
adult weight status/WC because they were pregnant at the time of measurement.

2,839), or demographic data (n = 87).
Our final analytic sample included
10,481 individuals. Comparing the
15,601 eligible participants included in
our analytic sample with the missing
5,120, we observed significant differences
by race/ethnicity, education, age, and sex.
To assess selection bias, we used in-
verse probability weighting (IPW), which
assigns a weight to each subject in the
analytic sample so each subject accounts
for himself or herself in the analysis as
well as those with similar characteristics
who were not selected into our final
analytic sample (19). For each partici-
pant, we estimated a weight proportional
to the inverse of the probability of being in
our analytic sample. We used two sepa-
rate multivariable, logistic models to pre-
dict diabetes at wave IV as a function of
obesity (timing or duration), race/ethnic-
ity, education, age, and sex: one model
included the IPW and the second model
did not include the IPW. The b coeffi-
cients from the two models were nearly
identical, suggesting an absence of selec-
tion bias by race/ethnicity, education, age,
and sex in our final models.
Measures
Outcome measure. At wave IV, diabetes
was identified using self-reported previ-
ous diagnosis and A1C (from whole-
blood spot assays collected from finger
pricks, which have achieved the same
level of precision and reproducibility as
other standard methods of collecting
blood, such as venipuncture [20]). We
defined diagnosed diabetes as a "yes" re-
sponse to the question, "Has a doctor,
nurse, or other health provider ever told
you that you have or had high blood sugar
or diabetes [if female, when you were not
pregnant]?" Individuals who responded
"no" and had an A1C $6.5% were con-
sidered to have undiagnosed diabetes.
In addition, we conducted sensitivity
testing of an alternative classification
strategy in which we take account of med-
ication use, given that some researchers
have defined diagnosed diabetes as self-
reported diabetes or self-reported use of
diabetes medication (21). Yet some par-
ticipants may have used diabetes medica-
tion (e.g., metformin) for the treatment of
diseases other than diabetes (e.g., poly-
cystic ovary syndrome or obesity). For
this reason, we did not use diabetes med-
ication as a criterion for diagnosed diabe-
tes in our primary analysis. Nonetheless,
we conducted a sensitivity analysis, in
which diagnosed diabetes was defined as

self-reported diagnosis (using the survey
question described above) and the use of
diabetes medication (recorded either by
an interviewer when medication contain-
ers were available or by participant recall).
In the sensitivity analysis, undiagnosed
diabetes was defined as no self-report of
diabetes, no use of diabetes medication,
and an A1C $6.5%.
Main exposures. Height and weight
were measured in waves II through IV
during in-home surveys using standard-
ized procedures. As recommended by
expert panels, obesity was defined for
adolescents as a BMI equal to or greater
than the 95th percentile of the age- and
sex-specific Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention growth reference or BMI
$30 kg/m2 and as a BMI $30 kg/m2 for
adults (22). For women who were preg-
nant at time of measurement (wave II: n =
74; wave III: n = 152; wave IV: n = 256),
BMI was coded as missing.
Obesity timing was determined using
individual's age at the wave of initial obe-
sity classification and categorized as fol-
lows: 1) never obese; 2) young adolescent
obesity (initial classification of obesity be-
fore age 16 years); 3) adolescent obesity
(between the ages of 16 and 18 years); and
4) adult obesity (obesity onset at or after
the age of 18 years). Duration of obesity
from adolescence to young adulthood
was based on obesity status at waves II,
III, and IV and categorized as as follows:
1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (non-
obese at baseline and became and re-
mained obese at last examination); 3)
fluctuating obesity (any shift in classifica-
tion from obese to nonobese); and 4) per-
sistent obesity (obese at all waves). We
selected adult-onset obesity and incident
obesity as our referent categories because
of our primary interest in understanding
the effect of obesity timing and duration
on diabetes risk among obese individuals.
We include findings for individuals who
were never obese to allow comparison
with results of other studies.
Waist circumference (WC), obtained
at wave IV, was measured midway be-
tween the lowest rib and the superior
border of the iliac crest at end-expiration.
We defined central obesity according to
the criteria set by the Third Report of the
National Cholesterol Education Program
Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol
in Adults (men, $40 inches; women,
$35 inches). For women who were preg-
nant at the time of measurement (n =
256), WC was coded as missing.
Control measures. Covariates were mea-
sured using traditional survey methods
and included age; sex; education (less
than high school, high school degree,
some college, college or more); smoking
(nonsmoker, former smoker, current
smoker); parental history of diabetes
(mother or father [yes/no]); and race/
ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using
STATA (release 12.0, Stata Corp., College
Station, TX). To account for the stratified
sampling strategy and clustered sampling
design and nonresponse bias (18), longi-
tudinal sample weights and survey analy-
sis techniques were used in all analyses.
Percentages were calculated for categori-
cal variables, whereas means were calcu-
lated for continuous variables. We used
an F statistic to test statistical differences
between individuals with diagnosed dia-
betes, undiagnosed diabetes, and no dia-
betes. Given the low prevalence of
diabetes in our cohort, we collapsed cat-
egories of undiagnosed and diagnosed di-
abetes together for multivariable analyses.
Furthermore, 57 individuals with diabe-
tes at wave IV (by self-report, A1C diag-
nosis, or both) also self-reported diabetes
at wave III. Because diabetes diagnosis
could result in purposeful changes in
BMI resulting from diagnosis, use of med-
ications to improve A1C, or both, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis, exclud-
ing individuals classified with diabetes
before wave IV (results not shown); we
found almost identical results.
We used two separate multivariable
logistic regression models to examine the
association between obesity timing and
duration with prevalent diabetes. Effect
measure modification by sex was exam-
ined using interaction terms and Wald
tests (criterion, P , 0.15). We did not
find evidence of modification by sex for
the association between obesity duration
and prevalent diabetes (P = 0.35), but we
did find evidence of modification by sex
for the association between obesity timing
and prevalent diabetes (P = 0.03). For
comparability across timing and duration
models, we included interaction by sex
terms in all models. Given observed ra-
cial/ethnic disparities for whites and
blacks, we also used race interaction
terms to determine whether the relation-
ships of obesity duration (P = 0.0002) and
timing (P = 0.0003) with diabetes varied
in whites versus blacks. The low preva-
lence of diabetes precluded our ability to
examine racial/ethnic disparities in His-
panics and Asians and to examine a
three-way interaction between our main
obesity exposures of race/ethnicity and
sex. The final model predicted odds of
diabetes (undiagnosed and diagnosed)
by obesity (timing or duration) and in-
cluded confounders that met change-
in-estimate criterion (.10% change in
main effect coefficient) or conceptual ra-
tionale: age, sex (in race-stratified models),
race/ethnicity (in sex-stratifiedmodels),ed-
ucation, and parental history of diabetes
(smoking was not included because it did
not meet change in estimate criterion). The
final models were repeated with control for
current BMI, current WC, and age at men-
arche (women) to assess changes in esti-
mates for obesity timing and duration
once current body size and menarche
were considered.
RESULTSdApproximately 4% of the
sample had diabetes; half of these cases
were undiagnosed (Table 1). Further-
more, the prevalence of diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes varied signifi-
cantly by race/ethnicity, with blacks and
Hispanics disproportionately affected.
Among whites, 2.2% had diagnosed dia-
betes and 0.6% had undiagnosed diabe-
tes. In contrast, among blacks, 2.9% had
diagnosed diabetes and 9.6% had undiag-
nosed diabetes. Among Hispanics, 3.5%
had diagnosed diabetes and 2.6% had un-
diagnosed diabetes.
By young adulthood 3,899 of 10,481
participants (37.2%) had been classified
as obese at least once in the 13-year study
period, and only a small percentage fluc-
tuated in obesity status (Table 1).
age 16 to before age 18); and 4) adult obesity (onset at or after the age of 18 years). B: Obesity duration from adolescence to adulthood was based on
obesity status at waves II, III, and IV and categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (nonobese at baseline and became and remained
obese through last examination); 3) fluctuating obesity (any shift in classification from obese to nonobese); and 4) persistent obesity (obese at all
waves). Prevalence of diabetes was based on total diabetes, which includes (C) both diagnosed diabetes (self-reported health care provider diagnosis
of diabetes) and undiagnosed diabetes (A1C $6.5% with no reported diabetes diagnosis) unless otherwise noted.
868 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 36, APRIL 2013 care.diabetesjournals.org
Diabetes: obesity timing and duration
Diabetes prevalence during young adult-
hood was highest among individuals who
were persistently obese from adolescence
into young adulthood.
Total diabetes prevalence differed
across categories of obesity timing (Fig.
1A) and duration (Fig. 1B), and blacks
and Hispanics were disproportionately
affected. Although the prevalence of diag-
nosed diabetes did not differ by race/eth-
nicity, there were differences in rates of
undiagnosed diabetes, which was highest
in blacks (Fig. 1C).
Multivariable analysis showed that the
likelihood of diabetes for individuals with
adolescent obesity relative to those with
obesity onset at or after 18 years of age
differed by sex (P = 0.03) (Table 2).
Women with onset of obesity during early
adolescence (before 16 years of age) were at
more than a twofold higher risk of diabetes
in early adulthood (odds ratio [OR] 2.77
[95% CI 1.39­5.52]) than women with
obesity onset at or after 18 years of age,
even after controlling for current BMI
(2.26 [1.07­4.76]), current WC (2.91
[1.45­5.86]), or age at menarche (2.46
[1.11­5.48]). In contrast, men who had
onset of obesity between 16 and 18 years
of age had slightly higher odds of diabetes
than those with onset at or after 18 years of
age, but this association was not statistically
significant. Men who had onset of obesity
before 16 years of age had similar odds of
diabetes in young adulthood as men with
obesity onset at or after age 18 years.
Although individuals who were never
obese were less likely to have diabetes
during young adulthood than those who
became obese during young adulthood
(Table 3), this relationship was signifi-
cantly attenuated in blacks compared
with whites (P = 0.0003). Persistent obe-
sity conferred a higher likelihood of dia-
betes during young adulthood than
incident obesity in whites, but not blacks,
even after controlling for current BMI (OR
2.02 [95% CI 1.16­3.51]) and current
WC (2.30 [1.38­3.82]). The estimates
for blacks were attenuated after control-
ling for current BMI (1.36 [0.77­2.40])
but became statistically significant after
controlling for current WC (1.75 [1.01­
3.03]). Limitations of the sample sizes
precluded multivariable analyses for His-
panics and Asians. However, unadjusted
analyses suggest that the relationship be-
tween duration of obesity and prevalent
diabetes in Hispanics was similar to that
in whites. In sensitivity analyses, includ-
ing diabetes medication as a criterion for
diagnosed diabetes yielded a similar pat-
tern of results, albeit with larger confi-
dence intervals around the estimates
(results not shown).
CONCLUSIONSdTaking advantage
of nationally representative data, we ob-
served that 4.4% of our study population,
aged 24­34 years and measured in 2007­
2009, had diabetes. These estimates are
slightly higher than estimates from indi-
viduals enrolled in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
2003­2006, which report that 2.5% of
individuals 20­39 years of age have dia-
betes (1). From SEARCH, a population-
based study of diabetes, approximately
150,000 children and adolescents were
estimated to have diabetes diagnosed
by a physician (23). Our nationally repre-
sentative estimates suggest that approxi-
mately 309,209 young adults between the
ages of 24 and 34 have diagnosed diabe-
tes; thus, the transition from adolescence
to young adulthood is a sensitive period
for the development of diabetes. In addi-
tion, our estimates suggest approximately
265,624 U.S. young adults have A1C
$6.5% but have not been told by a health
care professional that they have diabetes,
and a significantly higher proportion of
these individuals are black. These results
are particularly concerning in that racial/
ethnic minorities may be at greater risk of
certain diabetes-related complications
(e.g., end-stage renal disease, lower limb
amputations, and arterial stiffness [as a
marker of cardiovascular disease]) than
whites (24­26). Furthermore, our find-
ings underscore the need for individual
awareness of diabetes risk, access to
health care, and physicians to screen for
diabetes in at-risk populations.
Although current obesity is associ-
ated with diabetes risk (7,9,10) and some
research suggests that adolescent obesity
is associated with diabetes during young
adulthood (27,28), history of obesity may
provide additional information about fu-
ture risk. Obesity during adolescence may
be more deleterious for insulin resistance
and diabetes than obesity during other
periods of the life span. There are notable
changes in insulin sensitivity during pu-
bertal development, and the adolescent

The, Richardson, and Gordon-Larsen
period is one of increased insulin resis-
tance, particularly for women (8). How-
ever, duration of obesity likely plays a
role as well. We addressed this issue by
examining adolescent obesity onset be-
fore 16 years of age as well as onset at or
after age 16 to before age 18. We ob-
served a significantly higher prevalence
of diabetes in young adulthood among
women who became obese before the
age of 16 years compared with those
who became obese during young adult-
hood, even after controlling for current
size and age at menarche. Our results sug-
gest that the influence of early-onset obe-
sity (before 16 years of age) may be
particularly deleterious for future diabe-
tes risk for women and could potentially
be related to biological factors associated
with being obese during pubertal matu-
ration. Disentangling sex differences re-
lated to the association between obesity
and diabetes risk is an area with great po-
tential for future research.
Obesity duration may also provide
more information about diabetes risk
beyond current obesity (29­31). Pro-
longed duration of obesity may result in
additional metabolic changes, leading to
the development of hyperglycemia and
diabetes (10,32). The epidemiologic
literature is mixed: whereas most studies
report a positive association between obe-
sity duration and diabetes (11,13,15,16),
others report null associations (12,14). In
our study, individuals with persistent
obesity had the highest likelihood of di-
abetes during young adulthood, even
compared with individuals with adult-
onset obesity. Yet we observed attenuated
risk in blacks relative to whites that must
be put in context with the higher propor-
tion of diabetes in nonobese blacks rela-
tive to that in whites, which is consistent
with findings from another large multi-
ethnic study (33). Given that, on average,
blacks have lower adiposity at a similar
BMI than whites (34), we speculate that
the observed ethnic difference in the like-
lihood of diabetes is attributed to other
factors beyond obesity. However, further
research is needed to understand these
racial/ethnic disparities.
Our study has several limitations.
First, Add Health uses A1C measure-
ments and self-report to classify diabetes.
Second, in our regression models we
collapsed all categories of diabetes. The
resulting heterogeneous group includes
those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and
individuals with undiagnosed diabetes (ei-
ther type 1 or 2 diabetes). It is unfortunate
that data limitations precluded us from
disentangling individuals with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes. The inclusion of individ-
uals with type 1 diabetes may have atten-
uated our results, although there is
increasing evidence that suggests a link
between obesity and type 1 diabetes
(35,36). The small proportion of individ-
uals with undiagnosed diabetes precluded
separate multivariable analyses with this
group. However, the inclusion of individ-
uals with undiagnosed diabetes is not
likely to change our results because these
individuals would not have had a pur-
poseful change in their weight as a result
of diabetes diagnosis.
Given the schedule of examinations,
we were unable to determine exact age at
the onset of obesity or the exact duration
of obesity. Instead, we know only the age
of a given individual at each wave and that
the individual became obese before the
wave II survey, became obese between the
waves of Add Health, or was not obese at
the time of the wave IV survey. In some
cases (n = 586), we did not know whether
an individual became obese before or after
18 years of age (e.g., individuals who were
16.5 years and nonobese at wave II and
21.5 years and obese at wave III). For our
main analyses, these individuals were cat-
egorized with adult-onset obesity. We
conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby
we reclassified these individuals as having
adolescent-onset obesity and found larger
estimated effect sizes in identical multi-
variable analyses, suggesting that our re-
sults using the original categorization may
be conservative estimates.
We take advantage of rich longitudi-
nal data from a racially and ethnically
diverse population followed over a period
of increased risk for weight gain, but the
small number of individuals with diabetes
precluded our ability to fully interrogate
differences in Hispanics and Asians in
multivariable analyses. Nonetheless, our
descriptive analyses indicate that Hispan-
ics have a higher prevalence of diabetes
during young adulthood than whites,
regardless of differences in onset and
duration of obesity, which is consistent
with findings from National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey cross-
sectional data, which examined concurrent
BMI and diabetes (37). Our longitudinal
data also show that the association be-
tween duration of obesity and diabetes
may be different in blacks versus whites.
To better understand the potentially differ-
ential effect of obesity on diabetes by race/
ethnicity, future research is needed using

Diabetes: obesity timing and duration
large, longitudinal, population-based stud-
ies of ethnically diverse children.
Using a large, ethnically diverse, na-
tionally representative cohort followed
over a 13-year time span, we examined
the relationship between obesity during
the transition from adolescence to young
adulthood, a particularly sensitive period
for development of obesity (38,39), and
diabetes risk in young adulthood as clas-
sified by A1C, according to the most
recent recommendations (40). Most re-
search examining the relationship be-
tween obesity and diabetes has been
limited to exclusively pediatric or adult
populations, thus precluding compari-
sons of adolescent- versus adult-onset
obesity in the same individuals followed
over time. Furthermore, the few studies
(27,28) examining the association be-
tween obesity in the transition from ado-
lescence to young adulthood and diabetes
have used self-report, recalled weight, or
somatotype silhouettes (28) and have
been conducted in relatively homogenous
populations (28).
In conclusion, we observed high rates
of undiagnosed diabetes in our young
adult population, which is a significant
public health concern. These findings
emphasize the need for awareness, screen-
ing, and access to care, especially among at-
risk populations. We found that adolescent
obesity (vs. adult onset) obesity and per-
sistent obesity from adolescence to young
adulthood conferred the greatest likelihood
of diabetes in young adulthood. Our find-
ings suggest that, in addition to current
obesity, information about timing and
duration of obesity are needed to fully
understand and predict diabetes risk. Fi-
nally, efforts to prevent diabetes must
address pediatric obesity.
