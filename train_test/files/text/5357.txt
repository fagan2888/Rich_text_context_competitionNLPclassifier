Abstract
The present article provides an overview of the best-selling apps for the age range of
0­8 years under various categories, including `Kids', `Books', `Educational games',
`Family games' and `Word games' in the two major application stores (Google Play
and iTunes App Store) in four economically diverse European countries: Hungary,
Turkey, Greece and the Netherlands. As tablets seem to be a substantial part of chil-
dren's leisure activities, and thus apps might play an important role in their development,
we conducted a content analysis to highlight two issues: the educational value of the
most popular children's apps and the fine-tuning of apps to the local culture and lan-
guage of non-English speaking countries. There is a large overlap between the best-
selling apps in the four countries; in fact, half of the apps appear among the most popular
lists in more than one country. Consequently, most children's apps do not include any
oral language and, if they do, they are not available in the local language. Furthermore,
the results show that a substantial part of the apps supported early literacy skills. In the
majority of apps teaching literacy, although advertised for the youngest, the focus of
instruction was more suited for school-age children.

Introduction
The ownership of tablet computers among adults has grown from 3% to 45%
since computer tablets were first introduced in 2010 in the United States
(Anderson, 2015). Tablets have also started to find their way into children's
daily life more and more (Chiong and Shuler, 2010). Common Sense Media,
a nonprofit organization, reports that 80% of children aged 2 to 10 in the U.S.
use educational media that are offered on TV and computer and mobile
devices at least once a week, including about one-third of children who use
them daily (Rideout, 2014). In the Netherlands, the ownership of tablets had
grown to 65% of households in 2015 (Statista, 2015) and children go digital
at an increasingly younger age. In 2014, 70% of Dutch children up to age 7
were reported to use tablets often (Iene Meine Media, 2014). Tablet usage
seems to be a substantial part of children's leisure activities, and thus the apps
they use may play an important role in their development. At the same time,
we have very little data regarding the language and content of those apps.
Consequently, it is of great importance to assess the apps that children spend
time with in order to make an educated guess about the impact tablet usage
may have on children's development and advise developers, educators and
policymakers. We expect similar growth in tablet usage in the three other
target countries of the present study but reports about children's use of com-
puter and mobile devices are not available for Greece, Turkey and Hungary.
Potential of apps as an educational activity
With more than one million apps available for IOS and Android devices and
the fact that the vast majority in the Education category target children, it is of
the utmost importance to examine the type of content that young children are
engaging with (Lauricella et al., 2017). Even though apps may provide an
active, enjoyable and engaging context, the question is whether they are
attuned to children's educational needs: Do popular apps offer opportunities
to foster children's emergent academic skills, including language, literacy,
numeracy and science? For playing a role in language development, the min-
imum seems to be that they include oral language, preferably the first lan-
guage of young children. There are, however, popular app series like Toca
Boca that do not include any language. There is only nonverbal information in
these apps, probably in order to expand the market.
Furthermore, there is an abundance of studies indicating that young chil-
dren show an interest in academic skills and develop those skills through
various voluntary activities in the preschool period (e.g. Duncan et al.,
2 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)
2007; Ferreiro and Teberosky, 1982; La Paro and Pianta, 2000). Purcell-Gates
(1996), for instance, gives numerous examples of activities in the home
environment that include literacy skills and that contribute to emergent liter-
acy. To mention some, parents and teachers read storybooks to children,
which improves their vocabulary and comprehension skills (Bus et al.,
1995); children of preschool and kindergarten age practise writing their
names and other words which may contribute to letter knowledge and phon-
emic awareness (Both-de Vries and Bus, 2010); children count objects in their
surroundings which may foster number skills (LeFevre et al., 2009); and so
on. Apps, if well-designed, may have the potential to elicit similar activities in
the age range of 0­8 and give a boost to early literacy and numeracy skills.
They may even have the potential to involve the child in these activities with-
out any adult support because they provide guidance and feedback that is
similar to adult scaffolding (Falloon, 2013; Kegel et al., 2011; Takacs et al.,
2014).
In fact, technology, if well designed, may have an advantage over traditional
learning materials. Apps have the potential to include nonverbal information
that may, if congruent with the verbal content, including a story, numbers
or letters, to facilitate learning in accordance with multimedia learning
(Mayer, 2003). For instance, in a recent review, digital storybooks with non-
verbal representations of the story, in addition to narration, were found to be
more facilitative of story comprehension and word-learning than traditional
paper storybooks (Bus et al., 2015). However, unlike research on digital pic-
ture storybooks, where studies have explored whether and how the multi-
media additions of e-books affect young children's learning, only a few
studies have investigated other types or features of apps to test their effects
on children's learning (Lauricella et al., 2017).
The aim of the current study was to test available apps as an auxiliary to
traditional playful activities that promote early skills in the language, literacy
and mathematics domains. As a minimum, we propose that the majority of
apps should expose young children to language, and preferably the local
language, as one of the best predictors for academic success (Morgan et al.,
2015). There are quite a few apps that enable activities, like cutting, decorat-
ing, cooking dishes or using make-up, designed to replicate aspects of chil-
dren's free play on digital devices (Lauricella et al., 2017). Although these
apps do not include any language, they are promoted as `educational' in
online stores (e.g. Toca Boca apps). As reported on the official website of
Toca Boca, these applications may improve `children's creativity' (Toca
Boca, n.d.). This and other app series are quite famous and rank high on
Sari et al. 3
the best-selling lists, but the question arises: Are they an auxiliary in addition
to traditional activities in early childhood, like drawing, writing and
dramatizing?
In line with findings by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, we expect that a sub-
stantial part of apps (about 40%) will provide educational content related to basic
academic skills, and probably more to literacy than to maths and science, as
children overall spend more time with literacy-related activities in daily life
(Vaala et al., 2015). However, whether findings from the American market
apply to the European market is, so far, an unanswered question. We also
wonder whether popular apps available in main stores include language, in par-
ticular the local language, thus promoting language skills as a critical aspect of
preschool development. This question seems particularly relevant in countries
that represent relatively small languages (Simons and Fennig, 2017). Compared
to English, spoken by 955 million people, Dutch (20 million speakers),
Hungarian (10 million speakers), Turkish (80 million speakers) and Greek (11
million speakers) are small languages. Without localized content, apps can be
promoted in more countries without the costs of translation and localization.
However, bringing out apps in such a way that they can be sold in different
countries makes sense from a commercial point of view but may be at the
expense of fine-tuning to a specific culture and the local language.
This study
The two major international online application stores, the App Store (iOS) and
the Google Play Store (Android), increasingly offer more apps including
games and digital storybooks specifically designed for children (Guernsey
et al., 2012). In every country, it is possible to download all available apps
in all languages, but a somewhat different set of featured apps appears when
you enter the store. The aim of the present study was, apart from an inventory
of the most popular available apps in four European countries, to be a test of
the overlap between the lists of the most popular children's apps across
European countries and what the consequences are. When apps rank high
on best-selling lists in different countries they may not include the local
language, especially when the language area is small, as is the case for the
countries included in the present study. This omission is of high significance
because, considering the amount of time that young children spend with
mobile devices, this may be a missed opportunity for language development
as compared to other common activities (e.g. watching educational
television).

The number of apps available in the local language may differ as a result of fine-
tuning, which might be related to prosperity. This could be another illustration of
the finding that the quality of educational materials differs, at the expense of
children growing up in less wealthy circumstances (Putnam, 2015). In order to
test this hypothesis, we compared lists of the most popular children's apps in four
European countries with relatively small languages and differing prosperity:
Hungary, Turkey, Greece and the Netherlands. Among the most popular apps
in the Netherlands, the most prosperous country of the four, we may expect more
apps in the local language than in the other countries.
In sum, in the present content analysis of the most popular children's
applications in four European countries we aimed to answer the following
questions:
1. Are apps available in the local language, and more so in more prosperous
countries?
Based on our impressions when familiarizing with the app stores' selections
of children's apps, we hypothesized that there is a significant overlap between
the best-selling apps in the different countries. Consequently, we expected
that most apps were developed by international companies, and accordingly,
the majority of apps do not include any oral language and/or are not available
in the local language. This is of high significance as such an omission
means that applications do not provide any stimulation in the local
language, which is a serious issue for the language development of children
of preschool age and for their emerging academic skills that are founded in
language skills.
Furthermore, we expected more apps in the local language on the Dutch
market as compared to the other three countries; GDP (Gross Domestic
Products) per capita for Greece, Turkey and Hungary ranges between 20
and US$ 26,000, but it is about twice as high in the Netherlands (World
Bank, 2015).
2. To what extent do apps serve educational aims?
In line with previous results regarding the U.S. market (Guernsey et al.,
2012), we expected that a substantial part of the best-selling apps would not
serve purely as entertainment for children but would have some educational
Sari et al. 5
content. Insofar as apps are educational, they are expected to relate more often
to literacy than to other academic skills and are mainly developed for children
of preschool age rather than for school-age children.
Method
Sample of apps
Popular online stores offer apps for children under various categories.
According to the scope of our study, we selected from the two main app
stores' categories that might include educational apps for children. In the
iTunes App Store, we targeted: Kids, Books, Education, Educational Games, Word
Games and Family Games. In Google Play, we focused on Books and References,
Education, Family Games, Word Games and Educational Games. We took a screen shot
of the top 50 best-selling paid and the top 50 most downloaded free apps in
each category on the same day for the Dutch, Turkish and Hungarian markets
(23 March 2015). The same procedure was applied to the best-selling lists in
Greece, but about six months later (16 January 2016). In some cases, 2­5
apps were included in one package in the paid section of the iTunes App Store
as a bundle deal. We decided to include all those apps.
We focused on the top 50. The exact ranking in each category
seems to change daily, but apps may stay for a longer period among
the top 50. About a quarter of the apps were still on the best-selling lists
one-and-half years after the first downloads. The numbers of the same apps
were 22%, 30% and 25% for the Netherlands, Turkey and Hungary, respect-
ively (on 5 December 2016).
We excluded any apps that were not designed for children, such as foreign
language learning apps (e.g. Duolingo), word games, dictionaries, adult audio
books, e-book readers, holy books (e.g. Bible, Quran), sky observation
apps, topology apps etc. When the same apps appeared in different categories,
we excluded duplicates. However, if the same app appeared in both stores,
Android and iOS, both apps were included because the two versions are
not necessarily the same. In the end, we analysed 560 Dutch, 492
Hungarian, 532 Greek and 494 Turkish apps for children found in the
Android and iOS stores.
Coding
Each app was coded on the basis of the specifications explained below.
To make all oral language and educational content manifest we applied very
6 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)
minimal requirements to apps that were coded as including oral language or
apps that were considered as including educational content.
1. General characteristics
1.1. Overlap across countries: We coded for each app if it was unique on the best-
selling list of the country or also appeared on the list of any of the other
countries.
1.2. Device: We coded the app store where we found the app: iTunes (IOS) and/or
Google Play Store (Android).
1.3. Developer: We coded whether the company that developed the app was a local or
an international developer.
1.4. Age range: We coded if the app was recommended in the app store for infants
(0­3 years old), preschool/kindergarten (4­6 years old) or children in pri-
mary education (6­12 years old).
1.5. Price of the app: We coded the price of every paid application in euros. If it was
part of a bundle we divided the price by the number of apps in the bundle.
2. Oral language
We coded whether the app contained any oral language (at least 5 words)
or not.
2.1. Availability of oral language in the local language: We coded whether the apps that con-
tained oral language used the local language or a foreign language. Sometimes,
the title of the apps was in the local language but the app itself in a foreign
language, mostly English. In these cases, we coded the language as a foreign
language.
3. Educational content: We coded whether an app included any content that was
relevant for basic academic skills, i.e. language, literacy, maths or science. In any
other cases, we coded the app as just entertaining. Some of the most popular apps
offer nonverbal games such as driving, cooking and decorating, we coded these as
purely entertaining. Other apps that we considered purely entertaining typically
included dressing-up and make-up games, activities like taking care of a pet or a
baby, or decorating cakes or a room. Apps from the Toca Boca Company let chil-
dren explore areas such as rooms, groceries and restaurants; see for instance Toca
Life: Town. The app is designed to be played without any instructions, dialogue,
narrative or feedback. On the other hand, puzzles, storybooks and games that
relate to basic academic skills, including counting (e.g. Lola's Math Train), com-
paring (Monkey Preschool: Fix it) and sorting (Monkey Math School Sunshine),
Sari et al. 7
were coded as educational. LetterSchool is an example of an educational app that
focuses on literacy skills. Children practise hand-writing letters and numbers in an
engaging and interactive way. We did not code the quality of instruction or feed-
back offered preceding or during assignments.
3.1. Literacy content: We coded whether the educational content of an app was
relevant for language and literacy development or not. We considered narra-
tive stories in addition to games and activities identifying sounds or letter
forms, teaching vocabulary and letter-sound relationships or practising emer-
gent writing as related to language and literacy. The apps that contained
narratives were mostly digital versions of existing print books (Dr. Seuss's
ABC; Frozen: Storybooks Deluxe).
3.1.1. Direct/indirect literacy content: We coded whether literacy skills were taught dir-
ectly (e.g. games with words, letters and the alphabet) or indirectly by means
of stories and nursery rhymes. Apps with a mix of the two approaches were
coded as indirect because mixed apps typically had a main focus on
storytelling.
Inter-coder agreement
The top 10 apps in all categories in the Dutch iTunes App Store were coded by
two independent coders in order to calculate inter-coder reliability statistics.
Coding these apps, Cohen's kappa was satisfactory for all categories:
(k > 0.78) whether the app was designed for children (k ¼ 0.97), whether
it was educational (k ¼ 0.78), whether it was relevant for children's literacy
development (k ¼ 0.82), whether it taught literacy skills in a direct or an
indirect manner (k ¼ 0.78), and whether the content of the app was available
in the local language or only in another foreign language like English
(k ¼ 1.0). The findings were very similar for the three other countries
where agreements between coders were also checked. All disagreements
were settled by discussion between the two coders.
Results and discussion
As shown in Table 1, there were similar numbers of apps on the best-selling
lists that we coded as intended for children in the four countries: about 500 in
each country. Somewhat more than half of these children's apps (on average
55%) were found in the iTunes App Store. Most apps were advertised for the
youngest age groups, i.e. for infants and preschoolers, and less so for school-
aged children. This was similar in all four countries. It should also be noted

that the app stores specified very large age ranges the apps were meant for, and
consequently, applications were often suggested for children between, for
instance, 0 and 5 years of age. For educational applications, this might be
problematic as it is unlikely that what is educational for a toddler is also
educational for a 5-year-old.
Fine-tuning to local language and culture
Overall, only 43% of the children's applications included oral language.
There was a significant effect of country (2 (3) ¼ 15.68, p <.001), with
Hungary having the smallest percentage of applications including any oral
language (36%) and Turkey the largest percentage (47%). On average, only
27% of the apps included oral language in the local language. Regarding
local language speaking apps, there were significant differences between
countries (2 (3) ¼ 56.81, p <.001). As expected, in the most prosperous
country, the Netherlands, there were by far the most apps in the local language
on the best-selling lists (50%), while in Hungary only 10% of the apps were
in the local language. In the same vein, overall, 10% of the apps were released
by local developers. There were significant differences between countries (2
(3) ¼ 67.10, p <.001), with the most locally developed apps appearing on the
Dutch best-selling lists (18%) and the least on the Hungarian list (5%).
As expected, there were substantial overlaps between the best-selling lists of
the four countries: half of the children's apps appeared on the list of two or
more countries, as shown in Table 1. There was a significant effect of country
on this variable (2 (3) ¼ 56.81, p <.001), with the largest percentages of
unique titles in Greece (56%) and the Netherlands (49%), as compared to
34% in Hungary and 41% in Turkey. As a consequence of substantial overlaps,
one might expect that apps that are intended for the markets of more coun-
tries would either have no oral language or, insofar as there is language, it not
to be in the local language.
In fact, we found evidence for these hypotheses. As shown in Table 2, there
were no differences between overlapping and unique titles in the numbers of
apps that included oral language (2 (1) ¼ 0.45, p ¼.50). However, when we
only considered apps that included oral language there were many more
unique apps featuring the local oral language (85%), as compared to over-
lapping titles (15%), 2 (1) ¼ 197.48, p <.001. In the same vein, more apps
that were uniquely popular in one country were developed by a local devel-
oper (19%) as compared to overlapping titles (2%), 2 (1) ¼ 177.30,
p <.001. In other words, unique apps more often offered on the iOS platform
10 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)
than on Android were more fine-tuned to a specific culture and the local
language. It is tempting to attribute these differences between countries to
differences between the countries' prosperity, but these results might reflect
either the preferences of parents and educators (there were apps in the local
language but those were not chosen), the availability of such applications
(apps in the local language were not available) or both.
Apps serving emergent academic skills
Similar to the results of the American content analysis (Guernsey and Levine,
2015), 37% of the best-selling apps were categorized as educational regarding
basic academic skills, meaning that 63% of the most popular apps were coded
as purely entertaining. There were significant differences between countries
(2 (3) ¼ 27.22, p <.001), with the largest percentage of educational apps
appearing on the Dutch best-selling lists (45%) and the lowest percentage on
the Hungarian list (30%). More educational apps were recommended for
preschool-age children (72%, n ¼ 339) as compared to apps advised for
school-age children (n ¼ 113). This finding was similar for all four countries.
Country-specific popular apps were more likely to be educational (45%) than
overlapping apps on the best-selling lists of more than one country (31%), 2

(1) ¼ 42.57, p <.001. It is important to note that whether an app was avail-
able in the local language and whether it was categorized as educational was
highly confounded in all four countries (the Netherlands: 2 (1) ¼ 26.19,
p <.001, Hungary: 2 (1) ¼ 10.33, p <.001, Greece: 2 (1) ¼ 14.87,
p <.001, Turkey: 2 (1) ¼ 5.49, p <.05). Thus, 75­100% of the apps that
were in the local language in the four countries were educational. This makes
sense as letter sounds, and similar topics in educational apps, differ across
countries.
When considering educational apps, about 72% of the apps were relevant
for children's language and literacy development. There were, again, signifi-
cant differences between the countries (2 (3) ¼ 23.57, p <.001), with
the largest proportion of literacy-related apps in Greece (80%) and the smal-
lest percentage in the Netherlands (64%). This also means that the largest
proportion of maths and science apps appeared on the Dutch best-selling lists.
Within the category of literacy apps, 34% taught literacy skills in a direct
manner. Most of these apps targeted teaching letters, spelling words, iden-
tifying phonemes in words and the like. The rest of the literacy apps included
stories instead of or in addition to the direct teaching of basic literacy skills. It
is doubtful that direct practice of basic literacy skills (e.g. letter knowledge,
phoneme awareness) matches the interests of children of preschool age.
There was a significant effect of country (2 (3) ¼ 25.29, p <.001),
with the smallest percentage of apps directly teaching basic literacy skills on
the Greek best-selling lists (19%) and the largest on the Dutch list (44%).
It might be that there are fewer Greek apps because international literacy apps
are not useful due to the Greek alphabet. The data support this hypothesis;
overall, 50% of the literacy apps were international, while this applied to only
23% in Greece.
Main conclusions and future directions
Overall, the results of this first inventory of popular apps are not very promis-
ing. One consequence of the huge overlap in popular apps across countries
(55%) is that most apps are not designed by local developers, which may have
serious consequences for their content. They may, for instance, not include
local characters, typical visualizations and local language, thus preserving the
cultural heritage and fostering children's developing language and literacy
skills. In the current study, we tested whether the set of apps that is available
in more than one country is less fine-tuned to children. We were particularly
interested in the language: do apps make use of the local language? We found
12 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)
that the majority of apps that are on the lists of popular apps in more than one
country and that include language are not available in the local language
(75%). This is a serious issue, particularly when we consider that children
spend an increasing amount of time with apps each year. The effect is stronger
the less prosperous a country is. This finding is even more shocking when we
consider the very lenient criterion applied in the present study, which was at
least five spoken words with no restrictions on whether it is in a complete
sentence or whether these words go beyond the most basic vocabulary, like
`hi' and `good' (E.g. Dr. Panda: Restaurant). The finding that many apps for
young children do not contain any language might be explained by consider-
ing the ease of adaptation of the apps to other countries. Apps without any
language can be easily offered in all countries without the additional cost of
translating them. Although this makes sense from a commercial point of view,
it is a loss from an educational perspective, as these apps provide no language
input for young children. In comparison, even television programming that is
not educational or designed for children includes oral language and thus
provides language stimulation.
About 30­40% of the popular apps are educational according to our
definition: they included some task that is related to emergent literacy, numer-
acy and science. This is not a change compared to the pre-computer era:
Since the seminal work of Ferreiro and Teberosky (1982), we are aware
that preschoolers spend substantial amounts of time on practising academic
skills. It is a reaction to the fact that adults are continuously modelling aca-
demic skills and children respond to that by showing interest in doing the
same activities and making attempts to imitate. We do not yet know whether
educational apps outweigh the benefits of traditional activities that relate to
academic skills and what the long-term effects are when apps are an auxiliary
in addition to traditional activities.
In line with Hisrich and Blanchard (2009), our findings suggest that
few quality apps are available for emergent literacy skills ­ even with a very
minimal criterion. Activities promoted by educational apps often include
assignments that are not age-appropriate. Many apps advertised for pre-
schoolers utilize direct teaching, e.g. letter training by making children
click on the letter that matches the name, while it is doubtful that this kind
of practice matches the interest of children in that age range. According to
emergent literacy research, children in this age range do show some interest
in reading and writing, but in a different way. From the research, it can be
derived that when, for instance, they make attempts to write they are more
interested in `drawing' writing: they often produce writing-like scribbles or
Sari et al. 13
strings of pseudo letters and they mix writing with drawing (Levin and Bus,
2003). More in-depth content analysis is needed to test whether apps reflect
such interests. However, from what we have seen, it is our impression that
among the popular educational apps there are no apps promoting this kind of
age-appropriate writing and reading activities. Note that computer programs
like Kid Pix that came out in the 1980s to elicit writing and reading activities by
young children are no longer available (see Labbo's 1996 description of the
programs). It is more common to practise school-like subskills of reading and
writing. The echoes of thirty years of research on emergent literacy and numer-
acy do not seem to reach the domain of educational apps, perhaps because the
development of apps is the exclusive domain of computer experts and designers
and does not include educators or educational experts. This might provide an
explanation for previous findings showing an ambiguous effect of tablet use on
children's emergent literacy skills (Neumann, 2014).
In sum. Our findings align with what Guernsey et al. (2012) describe as the `fast
evolving and chaotic Wild West of digital apps', and we gave some explanations
for this. In As regards exposure to children's first language, the situation seems
even more worrisome in countries with a small language base. Many apps are
developed without oral language, probably to expand the market for the apps. As
a result of that, about 60% of all apps do not include any oral language and, if they
do include oral language, they are not available in the local language, while
language input is abundantly available in most alternative activities for children
in early childhood. Another trend is that many popular apps targeting educational
issues are recommended for a far too broad age range between 0 and 5 years.
Many apps offer direct training in basic literacy skills including phonics/word
recognition and sounding out letters ­ all activities that are not developmentally
appropriate for the youngest children between 0 and 4 years of age. The advan-
tage of apps is that they are cheap and easily accessible, also for children growing
up in less wealthy circumstances but, unfortunately, the quality of educational
materials is mostly not satisfying, at the expense of those children most in need of
stimulating materials.
Limitations
The long lists of best-selling or most downloaded apps indicate how popular
apps are. The exact rankings seem to change daily. However, after several
attempts, we could not figure out how the best-selling lists are constructed
and which underlying parameters are considered. For instance, it is not known
14 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)
exactly how many downloads are behind the rankings. Furthermore, a ranking
might change at the exact time when someone downloads an app or the ranking
may be based on daily or weekly data. Additionally, the high overlap between
countries might be a result of how the lists are constructed: it might be that it is
not only local sales that affect the rankings on best-selling lists. Also, we do not
know how the lists relate to what is available in the stores. For different reasons,
there may be few popular apps in the local language: these apps may not be
selected or they may not be available. Likewise, the low percentage of apps with
educational content can be both a result of availability and/or the preferences of
parents and educators. As reported in the study, 72% of the apps are suggested
for children between 0 and 6 years old. However, for 51% of the apps, no
recommendation regarding the age of the audience was available. Additionally,
the downloading of the Greek list was not done at the same time as the other
downloads, which probably resulted in an underestimation of the overlap
between the best-selling lists of Greece and the other countries. Finally, our
criteria for oral language and educational content in the apps were set low (e.g.
including at least five spoken words to qualify for an app with oral language).
The results, however, justified this decision because even with such a lenient
yardstick a shockingly small percentage of apps qualified as apps with oral
language and/or educational content. Still, we did not differentiate at the
other end of the spectrum and have no information about the number of
high quality educational apps.
