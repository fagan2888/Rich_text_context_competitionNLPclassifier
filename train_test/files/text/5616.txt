The characteristics of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are
well documented and difficulties in social interaction are a
core facet of ASD (American Psychiatric Association [APA],
2000). Although the definition of social skills is not undis-
puted in the autism community, its description typically
encompasses perspective taking, joint attention, social prag-
matics, social reciprocity, linguistic conventions, and appro-
priate emotional affect. Social deficits in ASD have
significant consequences; people with ASD tend to be iso-
lated in social environments, especially in a mainstreamed
school setting (Rao, Beidel, & Murray, 2008; Sansosti, 2010,
White, Keonig, & Scahill, 2007). Social isolation, particu-
larly for adolescents, has been implicated as a possible cause
for secondary manifestations of psychiatric illness in indi-
viduals with ASD later in life (Hurtig et al., 2009; White et
al., 2007). Research suggests that the lack of social involve-
ment for youth with ASD leads to serious long-term mental
health consequences that exasperate social deficits. During
school years, these students may frustrate their teacher's
ability to manage a classroom of students with mixed abili-
ties, which can lead to the individual with ASD being moved
into more restrictive environments where positive social
models may not exist. The current special educational para-
digm involves the adherence to full inclusion for all students
to the highest degree possible. Students with autism can pose
unique challenges to a classroom teacher especially due to
behaviors resulting from a lack of social competence. They
do not learn social skills incidentally or vicariously in the
same manner as their nondisabled peers, or even persons
with other disabilities (Volkmar, 1993). As such, these stu-
dents often behave in a manner, which may draw negative
attention from others or cause avoidance by neurotypical
peers. In addition, they may find others unpredictable and
therefore difficult to interact with due to their failure to fol-
low rigid routines or structures utilized by the person with
ASD. The crux for the classroom teacher is to create a learn-
ing environment that will work for all students and avoids
crisis management due to problem behaviors. In other words,
educators need to reduce the potential for challenging behav-
iors before they arise rather than focus on contingency plans
for managing behaviors once they occur (Marks et al., 2003).
Based on the fact that poorly formed social skills is a com-
mon attribute across the spectrum of autism disorders,
directly teaching social skills is a proactive strategy teachers

Social Compass Curriculum: Three
Descriptive Case Studies of Social Skills
Outcomes for Students With Autism
LouAnne E. Boyd1 and Deborah M. Ward1
Abstract
The Social Compass Curriculum (SCC) was investigated for its effectiveness in improving core social skills in three descriptive
case studies of students with autism. Treatment fidelity of the SCC was also measured in the school setting. The Social
Responsiveness Scale and the Autism Social Skills Profile were completed by parents to measure pre- and postintervention
social skills for three students aged 8 to 11 years who participated in the present multisite pilot study. Fidelity of implementation
data were collected via a checklist during observations for three educators who implemented the intervention. Results
indicate that the SCC improved core social deficits based on standardized rating scales measures. Fidelity observations
revealed that 83% of teaching components were completed correctly after 3 hr of training. The results of this study aligned
with the National Autism Center's call for ongoing research of school-based interventions and school-friendly interventions
for people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

may use to effectively manage their classrooms. Time is
probably a teacher's most precious commodity. Therefore, a
social skills program used by teachers needs to be easy to
implement, adaptable to unique student characteristics, and
effective. Individuals with ASD are most likely to be recep-
tive to social skills programs that consist of routine struc-
tures, provide alternate modes of completing assignments,
use visual cues, provide mnemonic devices, and nonverbal
cues (Marks et al., 2003). Programs that are provided to a
whole class of students assist in creating a common language
in the classroom for social behaviors, helping all students
understand components of positive social interactions. This
may help facilitate positive interactions between people with
ASD and other students. In addition, Sansosti, in a guide for
school-based professionals, states,
. . . to be most effective, school-based efforts aimed at enhancing
the social skill development of individuals with ASD should be
conducted by using a systematic approach. That is, social skill
interventions should focus on a combination of school-wide,
small group, and individualized supports. (Sansosti, 2010,
p. 259)
Current social skills interventions approach the problem
from an environmental standpoint as well as intra-individually.
Environmental interventions aim to alter the setting by work-
ing with other students and creating a physical environment
that facilitates social interactions. These include The Circle
of Friends Program (Frederickson & Turner, 2003) and Peer
Buddies (Roeyers, 1996), which work with typically devel-
oped students to form facilitated friendships between stu-
dents with ASD and neurotypical peers. These interventions
have positive anecdotal effects for all young people involved
(National Autism Center, 2009). However, the positive
impact of these environmental interventions does not con-
tinue when a person with ASD leaves his or her school site or
reaches adulthood. Orsmond, Krauss, and Seltzer (2004)
reviewed social relationships among adults with autism and
found that nearly 50% of the adults with ASD reported no
social interactions outside prearranged group activities.
Moreover, the same study found that reciprocal friendships
existed for only 8% of adults with ASD when prearranged
social outings were not provided. These findings corrobo-
rated the low rate of friendships reported in other studies
and helped reveal the unfortunate fate for many people with
ASD who age-out of school and lose facilitated social inter-
actions. The absence of structured friendships for these
adults explains the profound loneliness and isolation lead-
ing to the onset of psychiatric behavioral problems that may
further restrict access to community life (Ghaziuddin,
Ghaziuddin, & Greden, 2002). As Ghaziuddin et al. (2002)
detail, social isolation and resultant psychiatric behavior
problems further diminish a person with ASD's ability to
engage in the community at large, thus creating an immea-
surable fissure between sound mental health and mental
illness. This means that young people with autism need to
learn skills rather than depend fully on changes to their
environment.
There is a shortage of evidence-based social skills curri-
cula available to teachers of students with ASD, while at the
same time educators are experiencing the striking rise in the
occurrence of children with autism. The current estimate for
autism prevalence is 1 in 88 for all children and 1 in 54 for
male children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC], 2013), which is up from a rate of 5 cases per 10,000
individuals approximately 10 years ago (APA, 2000).
Individuals with ASD are no longer rare in classrooms and
their needs are painfully obvious to any educator. The
National Autism Center's large-scale project, National
Standards Project, seeks to objectively articulate evidence-
based thematic intervention approaches for ASD rather than
endorse particular curriculums or programs. This project
calls for the use of established and emerging interventions
for people with ASD and for educators to conduct scientifi-
cally meaningful research to further establish interventions
for this population. Krasny, Williams, Provencal, and
Ozonoff (2003) argue that fundamental skills needed are:
nonverbal skills, emotional awareness, conversation skills,
and social problem solving. The Social Compass Curriculum
is a story-based intervention; as such it uses an instructional
methodology cited among the established practices accord-
ing to the National Standards report (NationalAutism Center,
2009). Furthermore, the SCC intervention meets the need for
schools to be the place where the majority of intervention
occurs for young people with ASD. The SCC was initiated in
the schools after collaboration with educators, parents, and
specialists; the first edition of the SCC was implemented
in 2002. The SCC has its foundation in a story-based
intervention that focuses on four key areas: Nonverbal
Communication, Emotions, "We" Skills, and Social Problem
Solving. Each lesson consists of a story relating a particular
social problem, a visual aid, facilitator modeling of success-
ful behavior to remedy the social problem, student role-
playing, student self-reflection, and a letter to the home to
enhance generalization of learned skills. In 2011, a poster
was presented at the California Association of School
Psychologists presenting data reflecting that educators found
the SCC very effective for teaching social skills to students
with autism within a school setting (Boyd, McClelland, &
Flowers, 2011). These findings were based on an online
anonymous, nine-item Likert-type scale, wherein 100 educa-
tors who attended a training on the SCC were invited to
respond. These educators worked within one suburban
Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) including ele-
mentary, middle, high school, and adult transition grade lev-
els. Of the 100 educators invited to participate in the survey,
18 responded. The highest percentage of respondents repre-
sented educators who work with students whose disabilities
range from mild to moderate and whose educational place-
ment was in special day class. The majority of the students
Boyd and Ward 3
were reported to function within the first to sixth grade level.
Sixty percent of respondents reported that they were able to
implement the SCC in their classrooms "pretty well" which
was reported via the following scale: 1 = not well, 2 = some-
what well, 3 = pretty well, 4 = very well. Due to anonymity of
the survey, the researchers were not able to determine the
number of hours of training the educators had prior to imple-
mentation. The results may be biased toward individuals
who had positive relationships with the creators of this cur-
riculum and thus took the time to respond to the survey.
However, this preliminary data suggest that students who
function between the first and sixth grade levels were able to
access the curriculum in a school setting, while the actual
grade level of the students is unknown. Based on preliminary
data, it appears that students who function at the elementary
grade levels can benefit from the SCC and that their teachers
found they could use the SCC "pretty well" in a school set-
ting (Boyd et al., 2011).
The current research aims to answer two research
questions:
Research Question 1: Does the SCC improve social
skills per parental rating scales?
Research Question 2: Can educators implement the SCC
with fidelity after approximately 3 hr of training?
In the present study, fidelity was measured via direct
observation by the trainer using a checklist to describe how
well teachers are able to follow the structure of the SCC in a
typical school setting. Fidelity is an important component of
ASD intervention research since it ensures that the interven-
tion was implemented as prescribed and allows the practitio-
ner to estimate how applicable a particular intervention will
be in a typical classroom environment (Sansosti, 2010).
Method
The present study utilized a descriptive case studies design
for analysis of student social skills development in three stu-
dents with ASD. Two public school sites were invited to
participate, representing two different educator facilitators.
The SCC trainer conducted fidelity of implementation obser-
vations across the implementation of the intervention phase
of the study. See Table 1.
Experimental Intervention
The independent variable for this study was the Social
Compass Curriculum: A Story-Based Intervention Package
for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (Boyd,
McReynolds, & Chanin, 2013). It follows recommendations
put forth by Krasny et al. (2003), "fundamentals . . . such as
nonverbal communication and affect recognition need to be
practiced in a group setting" (p. 108). Areas of social skills
that are addressed in the 24-lesson curriculum include:
Nonverbal Skills, Emotions, "We" Skills, and Social Problem
Solving. Each lesson incorporates the comprehensive com-
ponents outlined by Krasny et al. (2003) and Marks et al.
(2003) such as: defined goals, visual supports, a narrative of
a social challenge, teacher modeling, rehearsal, role-play,
feedback, reinforcement via self-monitoring, and a take-
home letter to encourage generalization of skills. All instruc-
tional components of the SCC lessons encompass skills that
a classroom teacher or service provider already has in his or
her collection of classroom techniques. Each SCC lesson can
be completed in approximately 40 min with a group of stu-
dents. The 8 lessons of the SCC lessons were presented to
groups of students within a pull out social skills group. The
intervention was delivered by California credentialed educa-
tors who received 3 hr of training prior to and brief consulta-
tion during the intervention.
Ethics Statement
Informed consent was obtained from minor students' parents
for student participation in a school-based social skills cur-
riculum, collection of survey data, and presentation of data in
the form of a research paper. Consent to conduct research at
school sites was approved by a committee of administrators
representing the various school districts, the Special

Education Local Plan Area administrators, and the governing
cabinet for individual school districts. Students were given
the opportunity to assent to the intervention as well as to vol-
untarily withdraw from the intervention. No financial offer-
ing or gifts were provided to the parents of the students or to
the students for participation. The educator participants were
provided a free SCC manual that they were allowed to keep.
Participants
The focus of this investigation was on students with ASD
who were provided intervention with the SCC. The three stu-
dents evaluated had educational designations of Autistic-
Like Behaviors determined by school personnel. The
participants aged from 8 to 11 years attended one of two pub-
lic elementary schools in a suburban area of Southern
California experienced the SCC intervention. Demographics
of three students studied with ASD consisted of two male
students and one female student. All three students attend
public elementary school in a fully included general educa-
tion environment without the assistance of an adult aide. All
students are able to access grade-level academics indepen-
dently. The three students would be described as individuals
with high functioning autism based on their ability to access
grade-level general education academics. However, these
students showed social impairments with T-scores about 76
on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). The three stu-
dents studied were provided the SCC intervention as a pull
out designated service per their individualized education
program. See Table 2.
Three public educators were observed to measure fidelity
of treatment. Two were California credentialed special edu-
cation teachers and one was a California licensed speech and
language pathologist. See Table 3.
Procedures
The first month of the study, teachers attended a 3-hr training
using a PowerPoint that described the research components'
rationale and corresponding strategy present in each lesson.
Each of the five steps to a lesson was described in detail with
several examples provided from the text. The original of the
visual supports and how to give feedback was role-played
with the participants. At the onset and conclusion of the
study, social skills rating scales were provided to parents or
guardians of students with designated ASD.
Next, the social skill groups were assembled. Male A par-
ticipated with Teacher B (speech) in a mixed group of four
students who were pulled out of their general education
placement for designated speech services in one public ele-
mentary school. Male B and Female A participated with
Teacher A (RSP) in a mixed group of five students who were
pulled out of their general education placement in the second
public elementary school.
During the intervention phase, the SCC trainer measured
fidelity of the intervention using a data collection system com-
posed of a checklist. The trainer observed the entire lesson and
checked off the presence or absence of each step of the lesson
listed in Table 1. Targeted observations were scheduled once
every 1 to 2 weeks to achieve an adequate measure for treatment
integrity, 10 of 33 sessions were observed. See Table 4.
At each observation, data were collected on the educators'
implementation of the comprehensive components of each les-
son. Total observations may have included parts of a single les-
son as Teacher A and B provided intervention twice a week for
20 min and Teacher C met once a week for 45 min. Teacher A
and B used small pull-out groups and Teacher C worked with
the whole class of students in a special day class (SDC) with
moderate disabilities. The SDC teacher modified the curriculum
by summarizing the social narrative and replacing the self-
monitoring with whole group feedback as the students'attention
to these aspects was poor. The SDC teacher found it useful to
use two sessions per lesson for whole class instruction.
Social Skills Measures
Most rating scales are given at the beginning of a study and can
be used for follow-up measures (Sansosti, 2010). Two rating
scales were chosen to be completed by parents for this study.
The SRS as it is believed to have the potential to be sensitive to
treatment changes in children with autism spectrum disorder
(Sansosti 2010; White, 2007 ) as well as the ASSP by Scott
Bellini (Sansosti, 2010). The authors provide mean changes on
social skills measures as well as qualitative case descriptions for
the effect of the SCC for three students with ASD.
Social Responsiveness Scale
The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item rating
scale based on a normative sample of 1,600 children from 4

years to 18 years of age. This rating scale prescribes to mea-
sure emotionally appropriate social interactions of individu-
als who may have ASD. According to Constantino et al.
(2003), the SRS provides a .7 correlation with the Autism
Diagnostic Interview­Revised and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV;
APA, 1994) in its ability to identify autism and a .8 interrater
reliability. The SRS designates ASD by evaluating the indi-
vidual's social interactions without regard for intellectual
capacity. This scale is described as appropriate for research
pursuits due to its brief administration, approximately
15 min, and its linkage to current theories. It is designed to be
completed by an adult, a teacher, or parent. Subscales on the
SRS include social awareness, social cognition, social com-
munication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms.
The SRS was selected for its ability to quickly identify
aspects of social skills present before and after the SCC
intervention and for confirmation of identified participant
ASD status. The SRS was sent to the participant's parent via
the SCC facilitator. The parent independently completed the
rating scale as a survey without the assistance of the facilita-
tor or the researcher. The researcher scored the rating scale
according to the manual and analyzed the scores at the over-
all level, domain level, and item level.
Autism Social Skills Profile
The Autism Social Skills Profile (ASSP) is a scale developed
to measure social functioning in individuals with ASD and
specifically to facilitate progress monitoring through an
intervention process. The preliminary psychometric analysis
was conducted with mothers representing 93% of respon-
dents, then fathers (3%), grandparents at 2% and other as last
2% (Bellini & Hopf, 2007).The ASSP ascribes to measure
three domains: social reciprocity, social participation/avoid-
ance, and detrimental social behaviors. The ASSP utilizes a
4-point Likert-type scale for each of the 49 items and can be
completed by parents or teachers in approximately 15 to 20
minutes. Bellini and Hopf (2007) analyzed the psychometric
properties of the ASSP finding the internal consistency
(Cronbach's ) to range from  = .848 to  = .940 depending
on the sample. Test­retest reliability was .904 for the entire
sample and factor loading was low (.09 to .36) suggesting the
measure identifies distinct factors. The ASSP was sent home
to the participant's parent by the SCC facilitator; the parent
independently completed the rating scale as a survey without
the assistance of the facilitator or the researcher. The ASSP
was scored using instructions provided by the authors and
was analyzed at the overall, domain, and item level.
The tool was designed to monitor progress on social skill
interventions for students with autism. Bellini and Hopf
(2007) reported parents of students with intellectual disabil-
ity scores between 67 and 161, students with autism scored
between 67 and 177, and students identified as high func-
tioning autism scored between 70 and 177. Bellini and Hopf
(2007) reported the mean score for high functioning students
with autism as 109.83. A group if individuals with intellec-
tual disabilities or severe language deficits had a mean score

rather ranges of scores related to severity of impairment.
Results
Fidelity data collected by the SCC trainer is displayed in
Table 1. Key components of the intervention were monitored
while the teacher implemented the SCC with a mixed group
of students. All Teachers successfully stated the goal of the
lesson. Teacher A (RSP) and Teacher B (Speech) read the
social narrative aloud at each observation point. Teacher C
(SDC) did not read the short story aloud straight through
from beginning to end when the observer was present.
Instead this teacher adapted the story to address the student's
attention span and unique needs using gestures to act out
story as she went along. All teachers modeled skills, allowed
for student rehearsal, and provided feedback to students.
Student self monitoring was an area of difficulty; Teacher B
(speech) was observed as presenting the self monitoring
aspect of the SCC half of the time and Teacher C (SDC) did
not implement the student self monitoring component of the
lessons when observed by the trainer. The self-monitoring
component of the Social Compass Curriculum was the big-
gest challenge to all three groups and required teachers to
prompt students to complete the self-monitoring tasks. To
teach students to self-monitor, the teacher is expected to pro-
vide prompting initially and continue until students are inde-
pendent and accurate with the task. Without therapist
coaching provided and after fidelity observations, teachers
reported they would be likely to stop implementing this step.
Overall Teacher A (RSP) implemented the SCC with 100%
fidelity. Teacher B (speech) implemented the SCC with 86%
fidelity. Teacher C (SDC) implemented the SCC with 72%
fidelity.
Social Skills Measures
Social Responsiveness Scale
Two of three participants with ASD returned the pre- and
post-tests for the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) fully
completed; one participant (Female A) returned a partially
completed posttest rating scale. The SRS generates T-scores
with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 based on a
normative sample of 1600 individuals. A T-score of T-59 or
below suggests normal range; T-60 to T-75 indicates mild to
moderate range; and T-76 or higher represents severe range
All participants for pre- and post-tests had T-scores in the
severe range and corroborates the identification of partici-
pant ASD. A comparison of pretest and posttest total scores
for the SRS shows that the post-test yielded an average T-85
versus an average pre-test of T-89 with a -4.49 mean percent
change. The standard error of measure (SEM) on the SRS is
2.4 for male children and 2.6 for female children. The
numeric difference of T-scores from pre- to post-test for
individual students as well as the average T-score numeric
difference was greater than the SEM for the testing instru-
ment, which suggests that the changes in T-scores were
greater than the degree of natural fluctuation in the instru-
ment's sensitivity. See Table 5.
Item level Analysis for Participants--SRS
Parental rating of participants' pre- and post-intervention
were evaluated at the item level to provide progress monitor-
ing data. The SRS rating scale employs the following Likert-
type scale: 1 = not true, 2 = sometimes true, 3 = often true, 4
= almost always true. Items that directly relate to social func-
tioning were reviewed and areas of change are reported
below for each single case studied. See Table 6.
Male A had the greatest number of socially related items
on the SRS that improved. At the same time this individual
student also had a T-score of 90+ at baseline. He improved in
multiple aspects of social communication such as making
eye contact and matching his facial expressions with what he
is communicating. Male A, according to parental observa-
tions, improved his tendency to interact with other people as
indicated by SRS prompts: does not join activities unless told
to do so, appears to avoid starting social interactions with
peers or adults, and has difficulty making friends, even when
trying his best. See Table 7.
Male B improved on four items related to social skills.
His parent's responses on the SRS indicated improvement in
the area of understanding that others have feelings or think-
ing, a measure of perspective taking. He was noted as being
able to imitate the actions of others more often after the SCC
intervention and was noted as offering comfort to others
when sad to a greater degree after the intervention. Male B
was observed as thinking and talking about the same thing,
which may describe rigid interests, to a lesser degree after
the SCC intervention.
Female A improved on six items of the SRS that relate to
social competency. Female A's parent reported improve-
ments in her ability to take turns during social interactions,
maintaining eye contact, and offering comfort to others when
sad. Her parent also reported that she plays appropriately
with children her age to a greater degree and is less likely to
be regarded as odd or weird by other children. Lastly, Female
A's parent noted that she was not observed as taking things

tions as often as before the intervention with the SCC. See
Table 8.
Autism Social Skills Profile
Of the three participants with ASD, three parents/guardians
completed the pre- and posttest measures for the ASSP scale.
At the time the ASSP post-test was completed, the students
had completed 8 to 9 of the 24 lessons included in the inter-
vention. The study began in January, sessions began in
March, sessions ended in early June and post intervention
was collected in June before the school year concluded. The
ASSP was reported as being appropriate for monitoring of
progress for social skills interventions; higher total scores for
social functioning represents more positive social behaviors
(Bellini & Hopf, 2007). All students' total scores for social
functioning increased. The range of percent increase was
3.96% to 32.94%. When scores were averaged for the group,
16% change was noted.
Item Analysis Pre­Post for single Participants
TheASSP Provides the respondent with the following Likert-
type scale: 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very
often. Areas of improvement are provided in the following
tables based on parental responses pre- and post-intervention
(in this case post refers to approximately 8 to 9 of the 24
lessons).
Male A improved on seven items of the ASSP that related to
social competence. His parent reported improvements in his
ability to interact with peers in structured and unstructured

how he was feeling to a greater extent than before the SCC
intervention. Male A was reported as having positive experi-
ences with peers often and joining activities with peers. See
Table 9.
Male B improved, according to his parent respondent, in
his ability to interact with peers during unstructured activi-
ties and allowing peers to join in activities. He was reported
as engaging in solitary interests or hobbies less often which
seems to account for the aforementioned report of engaging
with others more often. He was noted as being less likely to
misinterpret the intentions of others as well as being less
likely to end conversations abruptly. See Table 10.
Female A improved on three items on the ASSP that relate
to social competency by her parent. From baseline to the
post-measure, Female A was more likely to interact with
peers in structured and unstructured activities. She was also
reported to interact with groups of peers more often than
prior to the SCC intervention. See Table 11.
Discussion
The results of this study at least partially answer the research
question as to whether parents of individuals studied with
ASD would note improvements in core social skills.
Combined parental pre- and post-measures using the ASSP
showed that indicators of social reciprocity by querying
aspects of social exchange, such as maintaining the "give
and take" of conversations, responding to questions directed
at him or her, taking turns during a game, acknowledging
others' interests, and joining a conversation without
interrupting (Bellini & Hopf, 2007, p. 85) improved from the
baseline after approximately eight to nine lessons through
the 6-month period of the case studies on the SCC interven-
tion. Comparison of averaged pre- and posttest results
revealed an increase in social functioning of 16% change,
with an average pretest score of 100 and an average posttest
score of 116. When individual items were analyzed for the
three students with ASD, there was an overlap in parental
perception of improvement for interacting with peers in
unstructured activities for all three students. The fact that all
three parents observed their child interacting with others dur-
ing unstructured activities is a major gain for these youths as
unplanned interactions with peers is known to be an aspect of
social interaction that is particularly difficult for people with
autism who often seek interactions that are controlled by
adults (Orsmond et al., 2004). The SCC includes multiple
lessons that directly teach individuals the mechanics of social
interactions; moreover, the use of peer role-plays integrates a
range of interpretations by students in which the student with
ASD can observe and learn appropriate responses.
The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) supports out-
come analysis of emotionally appropriate social interactions
of people with ASD. The SRS has an additional function of
assisting in the identification of people with ASD. In this
regard, the SRS provided a dual purpose: first, to measure
differences in congruency of emotional response to social
interactions pre and post, and second, to confirm that partici-
pants noted in the study as havingASD were correctly identi-
fied. The SRS provides T-score designations of functional
level; a T-score of 59 or below is considered normal range,
T-60 to T-75 relates to mild to moderate range, and T-76 or

greater indicates severe range. All participants exhibited
T-scores greater than 76, indicating a high probability of
ASD. T-scores for all participants decreased after exposure
to the SCC intervention. The average percentage change was
-4.49 with an average difference of 4 for T-score results. All
outcome measures were above the cutoff for standard error
of measure, suggesting changes were greater than natural
fluctuations in scores innate to the SRS. For the participants
in this study, the item analysis of the SRS showed improve-
ment in social skills as it relates to emotional appropriateness
of the situation while participant T-scores remained within
the severe range. This finding suggests that the pivotal skills
of emotional awareness and social problem solving may
have improved after exposure to the SCC.
When individual items were evaluated for the three students
withASD, there was overlap on two items between MaleAand
Female A and Male B and Female A. Items where there was
shared improvement across participants were using more typi-
cal eye contact and offering comfort to others when sad. The
SCC offers students the opportunity to practice effective con-
versational behaviors, which include facing one's conversa-
tional partner and this repeated practice may have improved the
children's tendency to offer eye contact. Emotional understand-
ing represents a unit of lessons in the SCC including identifying
emotions based on facial expressions and discerning emotional
intensity in others. Appropriate responses to other's emotions
are presented in a social narrative, modeled by the facilitator,
role played by the student, and then considered by peer review
as well as self-reflection. At face value it appears that the SCC
would teach emotional understanding in such a way that
improvements may be accepted as actual changes in the child
withASD's understanding of how to interact with a person who
is sad by offering comfort.
Specific topics covered during the course of the SCC
intervention were reading body language, using proximity to
communicate intent to communicate, using volume and tone
of voice to communicate in expected fashion with peers,
using social referencing to communicate intent to interact
with group, and using appropriate intensity of emotions to
match the emotional intensity of the social situation. Methods
for teaching include providing an adult-generated model,
imitating model (rehearsal), adult and peer feedback of cor-
rect and incorrect examples of behavior, student role-
playing, allowing peer-mediated feedback, and last, student
self-monitoring. In addition, each lesson included a parent
send home letter to describe the content of the lesson and
encourage parental praise of desired behaviors--a practice to
encourage generalization and maintenance of learned behav-
iors. The inclusion of a parent letter describing the content of
each lesson may have caused the parents to inflate their rat-
ings on measures of social skills due to directing the parent's
attention to particular social skills. Although this practice
may have inflated parental responses, this possibility is
viewed as a positive attribute, because this would mean that
the parents were attending to positive behaviors to a greater
degree than prior to the SCC intervention. Praise of prosocial
behaviors by parents would predict repetition of those behav-
iors by the children, assuming the children desire parental
attention, and thus would possibly increase those behaviors
in multiple environments which may influence generaliza-
tion as well as maintenance of learned skills.
Previously presented research revealed that a group of 18
educators found that they were able to implement the SCC
pretty well with limited training (Boyd et al., 2011). To be
useful, an intervention benefits from a format that reduces
interventionist's vigilance (Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, &
Carter, 1999a).Apredictable routine in an intervention aligns
with strengths of people with ASD in adhering to routines
(Krasny et al., 2003; Marks et al., 2003). The SCC uses a
common structure to each lesson while addressing new con-
cepts, thus providing needed routines which lessen interven-
tionist vigilance. For a teacher, this would likely improve
fidelity as well as satisfaction with the SCC. Moreover, stu-
dent motivation was noted by Krasny as being related to stu-
dent perceived relevance of the instructed social skills, and
was reported as being enhanced by story-based lessons
(Krasny et al., 2003). Each SCC lesson includes a vignette of
a particular social problem wherein the protagonist of the
story solves his or her social problem. The SCC social narra-
tives serve a dual purpose: to provide relevance to the skills
taught as well as providing an explicit example of a social
problem and how the problem can be solved.
The SCC is an intervention that educators were able to use
with fidelity; educators reported that students could partici-
pate in it easily, and it stated teaching procedures clearly.
This is especially important with regard to current political
educational mandates that educators must apply differenti-
ated teaching for individuals with ASD. For example, state
mandates in California require special educators to obtain
additional credentialing, an autism authorization, to teach
students with autism. The need for school-friendly effective
interventions are timely and of paramount importance.

The research presented in this study suggests that the
Social Compass Curriculum melds currentASD instructional
best practices with user-friendly intervention educators can
easily use with a whole class or smaller groups of students.
According to Odom and others (2003) theAPA, Division 12,
reported on single-case research designs that were deemed well
established or probably efficacious based on particular stan-
dards. Those single-case research designs that included N > 9,
included well-designed experimental procedures, a treatment
manual, fully described participants, and compared the treat-
ment with another treatment or condition were deemed well
established. Single case studies that included N > 3 and met the
same criteria as noted earlier were described as probably effica-
cious. This research did not meet the standards for "probably
efficacious" based on the APA's criteria on multiple levels.
Although a series of three case studies were presented and had
some areas of common findings, the number was not greater
than three. A treatment or intervention manual was available to
the facilitators and did result in strong fidelity for the implemen-
tation of the SCC intervention for the students with ASD who
were reported here, but the students'single cases were not com-
pared with another treatment or a control condition. The experi-
mental design of pre- to post-test is not as strong as other single
case designs such as ABA (baseline, intervention, removal of
intervention) due to the nature of an intervention that includes
learning which is impossible to remove once gained by the par-
ticipants. Possible confounds to the findings in this study include
possible inflation of parental responses due to knowledge of the
content of lessons taught with the SCC as well as potential
desire to report positive results due to parental relationships
with the facilitators of SCC or the author of the SCC.
The gold standard of research, the fully randomized clini-
cal trials as used in medical research, is far from the portrayal
of data here, and it is well known that educational research
often falls short of the ultimate goal (Odom et al., 2005). In
an evaluation of research in special education, it was noted
that special education research is particularly complex due to
heterogeneity of participant characteristics and the contin-
uum of educational placements which makes the creation of
equivalent groups with large enough sample sizes very dif-
ficult to obtain or infeasible (Odom et al., 2005).
This study does provide preliminary data that helped
determine which rating scales possessed the specificity
needed to measure small changes after the SCC intervention;
the Social Responsiveness Scale and the ASSP yielded
changes pre- and post-intervention. Moreover, parental
observations of improvement were noted in several items on
the SRS and ASSP some of which overlapped which suggest
that changes may have been due to more than chance. Face
validity applies when one compares items wherein students
behaviors changed align well with social skills directly
taught during the SCC intervention.
Maintenance of social capacity is another area wherein
the present study did not provide solid evidence and is thus a
fertile area of research. In the future, a social rating scale
could be provided to parents and teachers well after the SCC
intervention occurred to determine whether participants
maintained skills beyond the active intervention phase. At
present, teachers need as many classroom-based social skills
interventions as possible to address the unique needs of indi-
viduals with ASD, and small studies with preliminary results
assist in meeting this need. The SCC does align well with
recommended procedures indicated by the National Autism
Center (2009). In addition, teachers who used the SCC
reported that the intervention was easy to follow and that the
intervention appeared to work well for students (Boyd et al.,
2011).
Students who participated in the SCC were reported to
engage in unstructured peer interactions to a higher degree
based on parental observations after the SCC than before the
intervention. It is suspected that if these youths with ASD
continue this practice that social reinforcement will aid in
these youths continuing this practice which may reduce the
potential for future isolation known to occur in those people
with ASD after school-aged activities cease (Orsmond et al.,
2004).
The ultimate goal for full integration of individuals with
ASD into the least restrictive environment is to provide a
mechanism for all students to develop an understanding of
personal differences and develop a way to successfully inter-
act socially. It is believed that any social skills intervention
that enhances this possibility is useful for students.
