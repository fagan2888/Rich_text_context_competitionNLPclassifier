Caregivers of persons with chronic illness are at risk of stress
and adjustment-related problems, including physical and
psychological health impairments, disruptions in family
dynamics, and decreased relationship satisfaction and qual-
ity of life (Burton, Newsom, Schulz, Hirsch, & German,
1997; Chronister & Chan, 2006; De Frias, Tuokko, &
Rosenberg, 2005). Caregiver adjustment has a profound
impact on the well-being of the patient, as the process of
adjusting to chronic illness is affected greatly by the func-
tioning of the caregiver. Ultimately, the degree to which the
individual with a disability and the caregiver are able to cope
effectively with the situation contributes to the health and
well-being of both individuals (Chronister & Chan, 2006;
Elliott, Shewchuk, & Richards, 1999).
The importance of understanding the role of the caregiver
in the adjustment process is underscored by a general shift in
the health care system. This paradigm shift is notable in the
movement from inpatient care that addresses immediate
medical needs to outpatient care that addresses residual func-
tional limitations and reintegration into independent living
and employment. In addition, this shift is also affected by the
shortage of available paraprofessionals to provide assistance
with tasks such as daily living skills (McCann & Wadsworth,
1992; Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, 2001).
Consequently, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners
have become increasingly interested in the role of caregiving
in health care outcomes (Elliott et al., 1999).
Purpose of the Study
Prominent pain researchers have acknowledged the impor-
tance of incorporating families as part of the treatment pro-
cess for chronic pain patients. However, few theoretical
models exist with regard to family adjustment and chronic
pain (e.g., Kopp et al., 1995; Romano, Turner, & Jensen,
1997; Turk, Rudy, & Flor, 1985). While these emerging theo-
ries have served as useful conceptual guides for current
research and practice, a comprehensive search of the litera-
ture in this area indicates that empirical outcomes from these
attempts have not been published. In addition, literature on
caregiver adjustment to other disabilities stresses the need
for a caregiver of persons with chronic pain model that con-
siders psychological protective factors such as family
strength, resiliency, coping, and well-being. This model
should also consider social protective factors such as avail-
able social support and family strengths, environmental fac-
tors such as financial security and adequate health insurance

Psychosocial Adjustment of Spousal
Caregivers of Patients With Chronic Pain:
A Model of Risk and Resistance Factors
Denise Mercurio-Riley1, Gloria K. Lee2, Julie Chronister3, and
Elizabeth A. Swigar4
Abstract
This conceptual article aims to propose a framework of understanding the risk and resistance factors that contribute to
the adjustment of spousal caregivers of chronic pain patients (SCCPP). A comprehensive review of literature related to
caregivers of patients with chronic pain was performed. Findings from the review were applied to the Wallander et al.'s Risk
and Resistance Model of Adjustment, specifically examining outcomes among SCCPP. No statistical results are presented
in this conceptual article. We advocate for the need to study and test the adjustment process of SCCPP in a systematic,
comprehensive, and theory-driven manner to further understand caregivers' strengths and challenges. This will allow for
further rehabilitation interventions to address risk factors and promote resistance factors, allowing for more inclusive mental
health care for SCCPP.

coverage, and biological factors such as age and physical
health (Risdal & Singer, 2004). Given the need to understand
the adjustment of spousal caregivers of chronic pain patients
(SCCPP) and the lack of systematic and empirically vali-
dated models to drive research and practice, the purpose of
this article is to propose a comprehensive, theory-driven con-
ceptual framework for guiding research and clinical practice
when working with SCCPP. The proposed framework is
adapted from Wallander, Varni, Babani, Banis, and Wilcox's
(1988) Risk and Resistance Model of Adjustment. This com-
prehensive model has been empirically validated and sup-
ported within independent research as well as across different
medical disabilities. Specific literature on SCCPPis reviewed
and contextualized using this model as the basic framework.
Literature Review
Chronic Pain
The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)
defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experi-
ence associated with actual or potential tissue damage or
described in terms of such damage" (IASP Subcommittee on
Taxonomy, 2003). Chronic pain is pain that persists beyond
what would be considered normal tissue healing time (IASP
Subcommittee on Taxonomy, 2003). According to a large-
scale international study on the prevalence and impact of
chronic pain in 15 European countries and Israel, 19% of the
46,394 participants reported having chronic pain for
6 months or more and experienced chronic pain within the
last month (Breivik, Collett, Ventafridda, Cohen, &
Gallacher, 2006). Sixty-six percent reported having moder-
ate pain, and 34% reported severe pain. Forty-six percent
reported having constant pain while 54% had intermittent
pain. The range of pain duration ranged from 2 to 15 years.
Chronic pain is becoming recognized as a significant
national and international health care problem, and the rise in
disability associated with chronic pain has been described as
reaching epidemic proportions (Lindberg & Bluestein, 2002;
Mason, Skevington, & Osborn, 2004). Chronic pain has been
linked with mental health disorders, including depression
and anxiety, and has also been associated with impairment in
activities of daily living. Individuals with chronic pain have
been found to be less likely or altogether unable to work out-
side their homes, and others needed to change employment
or lost employment as a result of their pain conditions
(Breivik et al., 2006). As a result, significant costs are often
associated with disability compensation, loss in work pro-
ductivity, and treatment side effects.
In contrast to the general caregiving literature, there is a
paucity of literature regarding the experience of SCCPP.
There is some evidence that suggests that SCCPP experience
increased psychological distress, relationship dissatisfaction,
financial problems, role changes, and sexual dysfunction
(Kerns & Turk, 1984; Leonard & Cano, 2006; Rosenbaum,
2009). However, other research has shown that SCCPP do
not necessarily experience distress or negative effects as a
result of caregiving (Basolo-Kunzer, Diamond, & Reed,
1991; Feinauer & Steele, 1992; Flor, Breitenstein, &
Birbaumer, 1995; Liew et al., 2010). Literature in the areas
of positive psychology, resiliency, adjustment, and psycho-
logical interventions provide plausible explanations to the
varying adjustment ability of caregivers, including stress
appraisal, coping resources, personal attributes, and disposi-
tional tendencies (e.g., internal locus of control, optimism,
self-efficacy; Carver, Scheier, & Segerstrom, 2010; Horton
& Wallander, 2001; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). In
addition, Romano and Schmaling (2001) suggested that the
heterogeneity of chronic pain diagnoses (e.g., cancer-related,
musculoskeletal, neuropathic) may result in different psy-
chosocial profiles (different levels of coping mechanisms,
different levels and types of stressors, availability of sup-
port), which in turn may contribute to varying adjustment
results. Despite the heterogeneity of chronic pain conditions,
intervention studies show that couple- or spouse-oriented
interventions have a positive impact on the chronic pain
patient and SCCPP outcomes. For example, Keefe et al.
(1996) found that participation in a long-term spouse-assisted
coping skills training intervention resulted in significantly
higher levels of pain self-efficacy and increased marital
adjustment among patients with knee osteoarthritis. Martire,
Schulz, Keefe, Rudy, and Starz (2007) also found that cou-
ple-oriented education and support interventions effectively
reduced spousal stress, with spouses exhibiting less critical
attitudes, higher marital satisfaction, and less depressive
symptoms.
Theoretical Framework
Caregiving research has been called "one of the largest and
most conceptually sophisticated literatures in health psychol-
ogy" (Williamson, Shaffer, & Schulz, 1998, p. 152). This is
evidenced by various theoretical models of caregiving that
examine the relationships between caregiver stress, psycho-
social resources, and caregiver well-being (Aneshensel,
Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995; Chwalisz, 1996;
Haley, Levine, Brown, & Bartolucci, 1987; Lawton, Kleban,
Moss, Rovine, & Glicksman, 1989; Pakenham, 1999). In
general, these models are consistent with traditional stress
process theories, which emphasize the importance of the
caregivers' personal and environmental resources in their
adjustment as well as overall health and mental well-being.
Thus, like any stressor, caregiving stress is considered a psy-
chological situation wherein the degree to which caregiving
is perceived as stressful is based on the nature of the transac-
tion between the caregiving situation and the individual's
personal and environmental resources. Among the different
models used in psychological and adjustment research,
Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Transactional Model of Stress
Theory has been commonly adopted in such research. This
Mercurio-Riley et al. 3
model indicates bidirectionality on the relationship between
personal characteristics and environmental properties in
affecting adjustment outcomes when someone faces an aver-
sive event. Such personal and environmental variables, how-
ever, can be buffered by certain variables such as coping
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).
Although some empirical studies suggest that caregiving
may increase distress levels, burden, and marital dissatisfac-
tion (Flor, Kerns, & Turk, 1986; Leonard & Cano, 2006;
Zarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980), others indicate that
the role of caregiving may also provide an opportunity for
growth, satisfaction, and challenge (Benner & Wrubel, 1989;
Machamer, Temkin, & Dikmen, 2002) as well as improved
family functioning through increased emotional bonds
(Crow, 1999; Mazur, 2006). While a stress-based model such
as the Transactional Model of Stress Theory (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984) has received merits in its application to psy-
chological research, its utilization focused solely on coping
and neglected other pertinent factors such as the nature of the
stressful event, intrapersonal characteristics, and social sup-
port. The Risk and Resistance Model postulated by Wallander
and researchers, however, provides a more comprehensive
framework that includes variables beyond coping as a perti-
nent variable in affecting an individual's adjustment in
response to a stressful event. Wallander and researchers'
model has also been adopted and used in the psychological
adjustment research in adults and children as well as their
caregivers. Given the merits and the comprehensiveness of
this model, we chose to use the Risk and Resistance Model
as the framework for the current article.
Risk and Resistance Model of
Adjustment: An Introduction
The Risk and Resistance Model (Wallander et al., 1988) was
originally developed to investigate the psychological adjust-
ment of children and families with chronic physical disabili-
ties and illnesses. Included in the model are three sets of risk
factors: (a) condition parameters (e.g., diagnosis, visibility of
the condition, brain involvement, and severity of the condi-
tion), (b) functional independence, and (c) psychological
stress (e.g., handicap-related problems, major life events,
and daily hassles). Similarly, there are three sets of resistance
factors: (a) stress processing (e.g., cognitive appraisal, and
coping strategies), (b) intrapersonal factors (e.g., tempera-
ment, competence, motivation, and problem solving ability),
and (c) socioecological factors (e.g., family environment,
social support, parental adjustment, and resources). Research
exploring the adjustment of caregivers of children with a
medical condition reported that in addition to the normative
life events and the daily hassles associated with dealing with
the illness or the disability of the children, the severity of the
child's condition often leads to parental maladjustment not
necessarily by the disability itself but due to the
disability-related stress resulting from it (e.g., Brown et al.,
2000; McLean, Harvey, Pallant, Bartlett, & Mutimer, 2004).
This negative impact, however, can be buffered by resistance
factors that moderate or mediate the association between
the condition and adjustment (e.g., positive coping, positive
stress appraisal, positive locus of control, optimism, ade-
quate social support). Studies adapting this risk and resis-
tance model of adjustment have demonstrated consistent
results supporting the positive and negative influence of
adjustment outcomes associated with risk and resistance
variables, respectively (e.g., Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al.,
2000; Dekel, Solomon, & Bleich, 2005; Lutz, Barakat,
Smith-Whitley, & Ohene-Frempong, 2004; McLean et al.,
2004; Varni, Wilcox, & Hanson, 1988).
Conceptual Framework for the
Psychosocial Adjustment of Spousal
Caregivers of Persons With Chronic
Pain
In this section, we propose a comprehensive framework for
understanding the psychosocial adjustment of SCCPP.
Notably, the general examples cited in the Wallander et al.
model may not apply to SCCPP, while others may, depend-
ing on the clinical population examined. For example, brain
involvement is a logical disability-related factor for a clinical
population that involves brain damage (e.g., traumatic brain
injury). However, a study applying the Wallander and
researchers' model on a different disability group and care-
giving role (e.g., prostate cancer and female spousal adjust-
ment) may not explore brain damage but other pertinent
variables unique to this clinical condition, such as sexual
functioning. In this review, the general framework of the
Risk and Resistance Model will be adapted with the added
specificity from chronic pain literature on spousal and care-
giver adjustment.
Figure 1 depicts the diagrammatic representation of the
proposed framework. The first column represents the three
risk constructs, including the pain condition, functional
dependence, and psychological stress. The second column
represents the three resistance constructs, including stress
processing, intrapersonal, and socioecological factors. The
third column represents the outcome construct, which is con-
ceptualized as including a multitude of adjustment measures
commonly proposed in the literature addressing psychologi-
cal adjustment among patients and caregivers, including psy-
chopathology, health, quality of life, life satisfaction, and
marital adjustment. Under each of the risk and resistance
constructs, unique factors that make up its respective con-
struct are listed as bullet points.
The following discussion provides a detailed review of
each factor within each construct in this conceptual frame-
work. Because adequate evidence has yet to accrue in terms
of mediating or moderating effects, we are not in the position
4 SAGE Open
to integrate such effects with confidence in the framework
we propose. Therefore, the diagram represents a conceptual
diagram, but not a path analysis or structural equation model
for any direct, indirect, or mediating effects of the variables.
Outcomes
Much of the literature that has examined emotional distress
in SCCPP suggests that depression and anxiety are among
the most frequently reported complaints (e.g., Ahern &
Follick, 1985; Flor, Turk, & Scholz, 1987; Leonard & Cano,
2006; Schwartz, Slater, Birchler, & Atkinson, 1991; Turk,
Flor, & Rudy, 1987). In addition, evidence also indicates
higher marital distress among couples in whom the SCCPP is
affected by the chronic pain condition of their spouse (e.g.,
Flor et al., 1986; Geisser, Cano, & Leonard, 2005; Leonard
& Cano, 2006). Conversely, positive outcomes of adjustment
are also evident among SCCPP, and clinical interventions
have been shown to enhance these outcomes. For instance,
after engaging in a couple-oriented education and support
intervention for osteoarthritis patients, SCCPP showed
higher marital satisfaction, less depressive symptoms, and
better sense of caregiver mastery (Martire et al., 2006).
Therefore, research in measuring adjustment outcomes
should encompass a variety of measures as well as positive
and negative impacts.
Risk Constructs
Patient's pain condition.The first risk construct is the phe-
nomenon that defines what is unique about the diagnosis of
interest and its associated clinical manifestations. Under this
framework, this risk construct is the patient's chronic pain
condition. The pain condition involves the severity, inten-
sity, and the often invisible nature of the condition. Chronic
pain studies have found that the subjective level of the
patient's chronic pain condition is related to caregiver's psy-
chological well-being. Early study findings by Maruta,
Osborne, Seanson, and Halling (1981) noted that 65% of
SCCPP reported a decline in marital satisfaction since the
onset of their partner's condition. Schwartz and colleagues
(1991) found that 28% of SCCPP reported depressed mood
for which level of the patient's pain was one of the three
significant predictors. SCCPP also reported more personal
distress when the chronic pain patients reported higher levels
of pain and/or anger. In addition, Leonard and Cano (2006)
found the severity of chronic pain correlated significantly
and positively with SCCPP's adjustment in terms of depres-
sion and marital dissatisfaction.
Another aspect of the pain condition construct relevant to
the adjustment of SCCPPis the invisible nature of the chronic
pain condition. Invisible conditions are often caused by
chronic illnesses such as neuromuscular diseases (Matthews

Mercurio-Riley et al. 5
& Harrington, 2000), and they are occasionally of unknown
etiology. Understanding conditions such as fibromyalgia and
chronic fatigue syndrome may be difficult due to the fact that
etiology, diagnosis, and treatment are not readily present.
Similarly, chronic pain conditions may have no overt or
obvious source of pain (e.g., visible physical injuries), and
therefore, it may be difficult for SCCPP to fully empathize
with their spouse's pain. Faucett and Levine (1991) sug-
gested that this type of situation often results in others ques-
tioning the intensity of the pain as well as the psychological
consequences that accompany the condition. SCCPP's lack
of understanding of the pain condition and chronic pain
patients' behavioral manifestations (e.g., engaging in pain
behaviors, avoiding physical activity, decreased social or
occupational functioning) may lead to development of nega-
tive or critical views of the patient. Furthermore, this misper-
ception dramatically affects the adjustment of the SCCPP.
Martire and Schulz (2007) found that SCCPP who had an
accurate perception and understanding of their partners' pain
responded less negatively, provided emotional support that
was more satisfying to the chronic pain patient, and reported
less stress from providing support and assistance. Although
the focus of this study was on the impact of spousal response
to chronic pain patients, it also pointed to the importance of
the perception of the SCCPP in affecting their own stress
level and willingness to provide support. Early study find-
ings by Flor et al. (1987) suggested that SCCPP's level of
understanding of the chronic pain condition of their spouses
was directly related to their own psychological adjustment
and well-being.
In sum, while the pain condition can cause distress to the
chronic pain patient, it can also affect SCCPP in a substantial
manner. In particular, the severity and invisibility of the con-
dition may affect spousal perception, which in turn may
affect interactions with chronic pain patients. However, the
functional limitations caused by the chronic pain conditions
appear to have a larger impact than the pain condition itself
on the adjustment of SCCPP. This will be discussed under
the next construct of functional dependence.
Functional dependence.In our framework of adjustment of
SCCPP, the second risk construct pertains to the chronic pain
patient's functional limitations and degree of interference in
daily life activities related to the chronic pain condition, for
the pain patients themselves and to the SCCPP. Functional
dependence has been found to have a negative effect on
SCCPP. For example, high levels of spouse-rated patient
psychosocial disability were found to be associated with
greater marital dissatisfaction (Geisser et al., 2005). In addi-
tion, spousal perception of the patient's functional limita-
tions was found to be significantly related to the adjustment
of SCCPP (Geisser et al., 2005; Martire & Schulz, 2007).
Kopp et al. (1995) found that among patients with headaches
and chronic low back pain, the reduction of leisure activities
for the patients and their caregivers (interference) was related
to negative overall family functioning.
Sexual dysfunction is commonly reported among chronic
pain patients and is therefore an important factor of this con-
struct. Chronic pain patients frequently indicate dissatisfac-
tion with their sex lives, changes in frequency or complete
elimination of sexual activity, and a decrease in relationship
intimacy (Esmail, Huang, Lee, & Maruska, 2010; Esmail,
Munro, & Gibson, 2007). Furthermore, practitioners treating
musculoskeletal conditions are often not trained to discuss
sexual concerns, and therefore, these issues may be under-
addressed (Rosenbaum, 2009). Numerous factors have been
associated with reported sexual dysfunction, including psy-
chological factors, self-esteem, medication side effects, and
relationship problems (Rico-Villademoros et al., 2012).
Sexual dysfunction has been found to be more prevalent and
frequently reported by those patients with greater overall dis-
ability, higher levels of depression, impaired coping, and
shorter pain duration (Kwan, Roberts, & Swalm, 2005).
Naturally, SCCPP can be affected by the sexual dysfunction
of chronic pain patients. These findings highlight that func-
tional dependence and life interference appear to be impor-
tant aspects of SCCPP's adjustment, more so than the
disability or diagnosis itself. Therefore, it is imperative to
further investigate this factor to explore its clinical implica-
tions when working with this population.
Psychological stress. The third risk construct includes psycho-
logical stress. This construct is defined as any challenge that
one faces without having adequate resources with which to
cope. In this conceptual framework, this risk construct
includes the stress and tension resulting from the chronic
pain patients' own psychological and marital maladjustment
and SCCPP's role strain, as well as subjective burden. Early
study findings by Flor et al. (1986) suggested that the best
predictors of SCCPP marital satisfaction were a combination
of their own depressed mood and the marital satisfaction of
the chronic pain patient, accounting for 45% of the total vari-
ance. Similarly, Schwartz and colleagues (1991) found that
chronic pain patients' reported anger and hostility and spou-
sal level of marital satisfaction were found to be predictors of
spousal depression. The authors suggested that the relation-
ship between lower marital satisfaction and more reported
distress could be due to an approach-avoidance method of
dealing with conflict. Specifically, SCCPP may feel sympa-
thy for the chronic pain patient's pain condition but may
avoid him or her due to their hostile behaviors. In addition,
SCCPP who feel that they have no control over the situation
may experience feelings of helplessness. From a learned
helplessness perspective, this perceived lack of control may
result in depressive symptoms among SCCPP.
Other dimensions of SCCPP stress include burden associ-
ated with and resulting from the presence of cumulative
stressors. Subjective burden is defined as the perception of
psychological distress, depression, anxiety, demoralization,
and generalized loss of personal freedom attributed directly
to caregiving (Lawton et al., 1989). Caregiving stress
includes objective burden and subjective burden. Subjective
6 SAGE Open
burden involves the amount of psychological strain experi-
enced by caregivers that is attributable to changes in the
patient (Brooks, Campsie, Symington, Beattie, & McKinlay,
1986; Zarit et al., 1980). Within the area of chronic pain,
studies indicate that SCCPP experience high levels of sub-
jective burden in the area of worry, financial setbacks, loss of
freedom, and physical and emotional demands of caregiving
(Liew et al., 2010; Roy, 2006). Various personal, environ-
mental, and patient-related factors contribute to perceived
burden. It has been reported that SCCPP who lack open com-
munication with the chronic pain patient experience higher
levels of subjective burden and strain (Porter, Keefe,
Wellington, & deWilliams, 2008). Positive relationships
between chronic pain patients'levels of physical and psycho-
logical well-being and perceived burden of SCCPP have also
been found (Beckham, Burker, Rice, & Talton, 1995). In
addition, Martire et al. (2006) found that among other chronic
pain patients' pain and psychosocial variables, pain severity
predicted the SCCPPs' perceived stress level and their per-
ceived level of mastery, which in turn affect SCCPPs' psy-
chological well-being.
Another important facet of psychological stress in SCCPP
is role strain, which may be conceptualized as stress result-
ing from the dual role of spouse and caregiver. Role strain
theory posits that multiple roles may result in competition for
an individual's time while draining psychological and physi-
cal resources (Goode, 1960). Schumacher et al. (2008) iden-
tified two levels of role strain in caregivers. At the task
specific level, role strain is characterized by difficultly com-
pleting tasks and behaviors that impair caregiving. A more
global level of role strain occurs when the caregiver believes
that the entire caregiving situation is stressful. Caring for a
spouse or partner with a chronic health condition is often a
role that is imposed without choice or notice (Winter,
Bouldin, & Andresen, 2010). Ahern and Follick (1985) noted
that the level of disability incurred by a chronic pain patient
contributes to the stress of the caregiver and stems from
acute and long-term demands and the accumulation of other
responsibilities and stressors on the SCCPP. The impact of
this change may affect the SCCPP in areas such as social and
economic situations (Faucett & Levine, 1991; Roy, 2006)
and physical and mental health (Ostwald, 2009; Pinquart &
Sorensen, 2003; Vitaliano, Zhang, & Scanlan, 2003).
In conclusion, this body of research supports the idea that
the relationship adjustment of the chronic pain patient has an
impact on the adjustment of SCCPP. In addition, issues stem-
ming from the stress of maintaining dual roles of spouse and
caregiver should continue to be investigated in future
research.
Resistance Constructs
Stress processing. Stress processing represents the first resis-
tance construct in this conceptual framework. Stress process-
ing, as defined by the Wallander and researchers (1988), are
the cognitive appraisals and coping strategies used to buffer
stress. Before discussing the literature supporting the stress
processing aspects of SCCPP adjustment, a brief discussion
of the cognitive-behavioral transactional model of chronic
pain (CBTM; Kerns & Weiss, 1994; Turk & Kerns, 1985) is
merited here, as it will link the perceived burden/stress, stress
processing, intrapersonal, and social support aspects of this
conceptual framework.
The CBTM posits that family (especially SCCPP) tends
to be the primary source of social reinforcement; therefore,
its role becomes imperative in affecting the adjustment of
SCCPP. One of the key elements of the CBTM is the interac-
tion or reinforcement that SCCPP provide in facilitating the
positive or negative perception and behavior of chronic pain
patients. The concept of "transtheoretical" indicates that the
appraisal of the situation of the patients and the SCCPP can
play an important role in affecting each other's coping and
adjustment. Family, therefore, plays an important component
in this model by searching for information and evaluating
and seeking resources, as well as making decision based on
information gathered from others and the environment.
Family appraisal (from both sides) plays a role in developing
a schema or beliefs about the situation (coping with the
adversities of chronic pain and coping with the challenges of
having a family member with chronic pain). Central to this
CBTM is the appraisal-coping process, where appraisal of
the situation influences the subsequent coping mechanisms
and strategies and is important in determining whether the
specific response will be reinforced or discontinued.
As defined earlier, stress, a risk construct, is defined as the
perceived burden, subjective stress, and role strain associ-
ated with the caregiving role (Brooks et al., 1986; ; Zarit
et al., 1980). Stress processing or coping, on the other hand,
refers to practical actions taken and can include an array of
resources, styles, and efforts that people draw on when faced
with life stressors to increase a sense of well-being and avoid
being harmed by stressful demands. Definitions of the con-
struct have encompassed a range of personal characteristics
including stable and enduring traits (resources), habitual
styles, or behavioral patterns (styles), as well as situation-
specific cognitive and behavioral efforts applied in a given
circumstance (efforts). Numerous types of coping styles and
efforts have been conceptualized and tested in the literature.
The most popular conceptualization is the typology of emo-
tion-focused, problem-focused, and avoidant-focused coping
efforts (Chronister, 2004; Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman,
Thomsen, & Wadsworth, 2001, Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).
The role of coping in the adjustment process among
chronic pain patients is well documented. However, the role
of coping among SCCPP's adjustment processes is limited.
The studies that do exist suggest that SCCPP's and chronic
pain patients' coping styles moderate SCCPP's stress reac-
tions. For example, reduced SCCPP stress was associated
with chronic pain patients who had higher adaptive coping
styles and fewer pain behaviors (Junghaenel, 2007). In
Mercurio-Riley et al. 7
addition, SCCPP who used positive coping styles and
expressed an understanding of the patient's disability
reported higher levels of psychosocial adjustment and well-
being (Flor et al., 1987). SCCPP's negative coping styles,
specifically magnification, helplessness, and catastrophiz-
ing, have been found to be significantly correlated to their
own depression and marital dissatisfaction (Leonard & Cano,
2006). Furthermore, patients' helplessness and catastrophiz-
ing behaviors were also associated with depressive symp-
toms for SCCPP.
Chronic pain patients who use the coping style of "accep-
tance" report greater psychological well-being (Viane et al.,
2003). However, little empirical support exists regarding
SCCPP's acceptance of their partners' chronic pain and how
it relates to their own adjustment.Arecent study by Mercurio-
Riley (2011) found that SCCPP who reported higher levels of
acceptance of their partners' pain also reported better quality
of life across physical, psychological, social-relationships,
and environmental domains of quality of life. In addition,
caregivers in this study who were more accepting of their
partners' pain were also found to be more resilient. Studies
that have looked at similar constructs provide some support
for the role of caregiver acceptance and interaction styles in
affecting the adjustment process of the chronic pain patient.
McCracken (2004) found that solicitous behaviors (i.e.,
excessive expression of sympathy) by SCCPP are related to
increased patient pain behaviors, while punishing responses
from SCCPP such as anger, ignoring, and frustration are also
related to maladaptive patient outcomes, including less activ-
ity engagement and pain willingness (i.e., engaging in activi-
ties despite pain and doing little to avoid or control painful
experiences) and less overall acceptance of pain. In the
generic rehabilitation literature, the concept of acceptance of
a disability has been well documented (i.e., that a person with
a disability who accepts his or her disability as part of the self
is associated with better adjustment; Bishop, 2005; Li &
Moore, 1998; Livneh & Antonak, 1997). However, this con-
cept has not been applied to how others' acceptance of a
patient's limiting condition or disability would affect the
adjustment of their caregivers. An exploration of the coping
style of acceptance in SCCPP may provide additional evi-
dence regarding its role in adjustment, well-being, greater
relationship satisfaction, and improved quality of life.
While ample research evidence supports the importance
of positive and active coping mechanisms among chronic
pain patients in dealing with their pain and disability-related
stress, limited research has been conducted in the area of
stress processing as a coping mechanism among SCCPP. For
instance, aligning with the CBTM model discussed earlier,
an understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the
ways in which SCCPP perceive and cope with their stressors
is important in understanding their own adjustment. In addi-
tion, the concept of acceptance of the spouse's chronic pain
condition by SCCPP can be explored to understand how this
acceptance may have an impact on SCCPP themselves.
Intrapersonal variables. The second resistance construct con-
sists of intrapersonal, that is, internal characteristics of the
affected individual (in this case the SCCPP) when faced with
the stresses and challenges of caregiving, as well as internal
characteristics of the chronic pain patients. Such variables
will be discussed in relation to the SCCPPs' framework of
adjustment and include sense of coherence, self-efficacy,
locus of control, optimism, and personality. Antonovsky's
(1979) concept of sense coherence is defined as a mixture of
optimism and sense of control; one has a sense of confidence
about positive outcomes despite adversities in life. Several
studies suggest that self-efficacy, as defined as one's per-
ceived ability and confidence in performing or carrying out a
task, plays an important role in patients' own adjustment.
In addition, other studies also explored how the self-effi-
cacy level of the patient and the caregiver would affect the
other's adjustment. The level of the self-efficacy of patients
with rheumatoid arthritis has been found to be one of the
strongest predictors of caregiver burden and optimism
(Beckham et al., 1995). Self-efficacy in patients with cancer
was found to be associated with less anxiety and caregiver
strain (Campbell et al., 2004).
Porter and colleagues (2008) investigated the role of self-
efficacy in pain communication between SCCPP and chronic
pain patients with osteoarthritis. Findings indicated that
higher levels of self-efficacy among SCCPP regarding pain
communication were related to their own positive affect.
Specifically, SCCPP who were more confident in their abil-
ity to understand and respond effectively to the patient's pain
experienced more positive affect. In addition, higher levels
of self-efficacy among SCCPP were significantly and nega-
tively correlated with SCCPP's negative affect. Results from
Campbell et al. (2004) indicated that higher levels of care-
giver self-efficacy in relation to patients' symptom control
were associated with caregivers' reported higher quality of
life, better reported health and mental health, reduced depres-
sive symptoms, and less perceived caregiver strain.
In addition to self-efficacy, other intrapersonal variables
such as locus of control have been investigated in relation to
SCCPP's adjustment. Early study findings suggested that
SCCPP's sense of control was related to their adjustment and
well-being (Flor et al., 1987). Finally, SCCPP also reported
higher levels of control (manageability, sense of coherence)
and it related to better SCCPP adjustment when compared
with spouses with a partner without any disability (Romano
et al., 1997). It was suggested that lower cohesion is a result
of the SCCPP's perception that the chronic pain patients can-
not contribute to household duties and be a supportive mem-
ber of the family. Therefore, caregivers exhibit high levels of
control in response to the need for organization and rules to
help lessen the demands. Intrapersonal factors, similar to the
perceived stress/burden factors and the psychological pro-
cessing previously described, relied on the subjective
appraisal of the SCCPP. Despite the fact that there is a pau-
city of literature on the intrapersonal variables and their
8 SAGE Open
effect on caregiver adjustment, their relationship has been
supported in findings in literature of other chronic condi-
tions. For example, Piira, Chow, and Suranyi (2002) found in
caregivers of patients with chronic diabetes that caregiver
locus of control was a significant predictor of caregivers'
negative affect.
The attachment style (e.g., personality traits or interper-
sonal dynamics) of chronic pain patients and SCCPP has also
been studied in relationship to SCCPP's adjustment (Porter,
Davis, & Keefe, 2007). Chronic pain patients with secure
attachment styles or who are more interpersonally indepen-
dent were found to have higher levels of self-efficacy, opti-
mism in relation to symptom management, and positive
adjustment outcomes (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). Other
researchers have found that maladaptive attachment styles
are related to negative outcomes. Attachment anxiety (over-
dependence) relates to "hypervigilance," wherein patients
tend to exaggerate their appraisal of a threat. These patients
exhibit poor coping abilities, overdependence on others, and
prolonged emotional distress (Mikulincer & Shaver), which
in turn is related to a higher level of pain (McDonald &
Kingsbury, 2006; McWilliams & Asmundson, 2000). There
is also evidence that chronic pain patients who have an
avoidance attachment style tend to use "deactivating" meth-
ods to deal with the threat related to caregiving resulting in
the patient minimizing attention to and avoiding threat-
related cues, as well as underappraising threat and using
avoidant and emotion-focused coping styles (Mikulincer &
Shaver). Porter et al., (2012) reported that spouses of lung
cancer patients with an anxious attachment style had higher
levels of caregiving strain, and those with avoidant attach-
ment style experienced lower levels of marital adjustment
and lower self-efficacy in relation to assisting the patients.
In summary, this evidence supports the importance of
examining the impact of intrapersonal variables of chronic
pain patients and SCCPP in further understanding SCCPP's
adjustment process. Specifically, locus of control, self-effi-
cacy, and personality styles (e.g., attachment) appear to play
important mediating roles in SCCPP's adjustment (e.g.,
McDonald & Kingsbury, 2006; Piira et al., 2002; Porter et
al., 2008). The effects of intrapersonal variables, similar to
those from stress processing and perceived stress discussed
earlier, are intertwined with the perception of the SCCPP.
Ongoing research is needed to provide support on how these
intrapersonal variables play a role in SCCPP's adjustment
process.
Socioecological variables.The third resistance construct is
defined as external and/or environmental variables that affect
one's adjustment. Pertaining to the SCCPPs' framework,
these socioecological variables include spousal interaction
and social support.
In the chronic pain literature, social support is contextual-
ized in terms of how support or SCCPP's behaviors feed into
the adjustment of chronic pain patients. Referring to the
cognitive-behavioral transtheoretical chronic pain model
(Kerns & Weiss, 1994; Turk & Kerns, 1985) discussed ear-
lier, empirical studies have documented the effect of differ-
ent types of SCCPP response to chronic pain patients and
how such responses affect the pain behavior and functioning.
However, these studies have focused primarily on the adjust-
ment of the chronic pain patients and far less on SCCPP
adjustment. The various aspects of responses include solici-
tous, distracting, negative, and punishing spousal responses
(Cano, Miller, & Loree, 2009; McCracken, 2004; McCracken
& Eccleston, 2005; Raichle, Romano, & Jensen, 2011;
Romano, Jensen, Good, & Hops, 2000). Specifically, spousal
solicitous behaviors and distracting responses have resulted
in negative outcomes among chronic pain patients, namely,
increased pain behaviors, increased pain-related functional
limitations, and decreased activity (Cano et al, 2004.; Raichle
et al., 2011; Romano et al., 2000). Negative responses from
spouses have similar negative effects on chronic pain
patients. Specifically, it has been reported that chronic pain
patients who receive negative responses from SCCPP may
perceive the SCCPP to be angry or frustrated with them
(Cano, Weisberg, & Gallagher, 2000). This in turn leads to
decreased activity among the patients and increased reported
affective distress or depression in chronic pain patients and
SCCPP (Cano, Gillis, Heinz, Geisser, & Foran, 2004; Faucett
& Levine, 1991; Turk, Kerns, & Rosenberg, 1992).
Interestingly, negative responses in relation to increased
affective distress of patients were buffered by a globally sat-
isfying relationship while depression was reported among
chronic pain patients if negative responses from SCCPP
occurred within a globally dissatisfying relationship
(Goldberg, Kerns, & Rosenberg, 1993; Kerns,
Haythornthwaite, Southwick, & Giller, 1990). A punishing
response by SCCPP, however, was positively correlated with
chronic pain patients' activity. In addition, spouses who
attributed their partner's pain to emotional causes have been
found to give more punishing responses, possibly due to
decreased sympathy for the pain condition (Cano et al.,
2009). The impact of the specific chronic pain behaviors
manifested by the chronic pain patients on the SCCPP, how-
ever, is not well researched.
Additional evidence providing support for the role of
social and family support and functioning in the adjust-
ment process is found in the broader caregiving literature
but less so within the chronic pain caregiver adjustment
literature. Family support was associated with higher
dyadic adjustment among spouses and patients with trau-
matic brain injuries (Moore, Stambrook, Peters, &
Lubusko, 1991). Other findings have indicated that social
support is associated with lower perceived burden and bet-
ter quality of life and moderates family functioning as well
as caregivers' distress, well-being, and adjustment
(Blankfeld & Holahan, 1999; Chronister & Chan, 2006;
Ergh, Rapport, Coleman, & Hanks, 2002; Harris, Godfrey,
Partridge, & Knight, 2001).
Mercurio-Riley et al. 9
Research concerning how family dynamics, pain behav-
iors of patients, and the different types of social support (e.g.,
formal, informal, respite care) affect caregivers is lacking in
the chronic pain literature. As noted in the chronic illness
literature, those are important factors that may influence
caregivers' adjustment. Capitolo (1998) studied the effect of
family variables on SCCPP adjustment to chronic pain
patients and found that disengaged and rigid family systems,
as well as spousal negative response to pain behavior, were
associated with depression among SCCPP. In addition, there
may be other environmental factors that may affect caregiv-
ers' adjustment, including accessibility, availability, and
affordability of health care.
Summary of Relationships Among Variables
The proposed framework depicted in Figure 1 is based on the
three risk constructs and three resistance constructs guided
by Wallander's empirically supported model associated with
the psychosocial adjustment of caregivers of individuals
with health-related chronic conditions, with added specific-
ity to the factors in each of the six constructs in relation to
adjustment outcomes among SCCPP.
The three risk and three resistance constructs included in
this conceptual framework each contribute directly to the
negative and buffering effects on SCCPP adjustment, respec-
tively, as shown in each of the lines connecting each of the
six constructs to the outcome construct. Within the three
resistance constructs, the socioecological construct relates to
the intrapersonal construct as well as the stress processing
construct. Second, the availability of support is associated
with the perception of stress and how one feels about his or
her control over the adverse situation (unidirectional). Third,
the intrapersonal and the stress processing constructs, how-
ever, can operate in both directions. Fourth, the stress pro-
cessing and the intrapersonal constructs, which are relatively
stable characteristics of a person, would not affect an indi-
vidual's environmental resources.
Within the three risk constructs, the disability construct
relates to the functional dependence as well as the psycho-
logical stress constructs, and the stress construct also relates
to the functional dependence construct. Furthermore, all
three risk constructs represented in the far left column have
been shown to be mediated and/or moderated by either one
or a combination of the resistance constructs shown in the
middle column.
Several additional trends in the literature were observed
in which the relationships among certain variables were less
conclusive. First, chronic pain's resultant functional limita-
tions and dependence, rather than the chronic pain condition
itself, appears to have the strongest impact on SCCPP adjust-
ment. While ample literature in the general caregiving field
supports the influence of the stress processing construct of
perceived burden and stress on caregiver adjustment, this has
not been adequately studied and documented in the SCCPP
adjustment literature, especially the duality of the caregiving
role. In addition, the role of coping--by SCCPP and the
chronic pain patients--and SCCPP role strain warrant fur-
ther study and evidence to support its effect on SCCPP
adjustment. In terms of the intrapersonal construct, self-effi-
cacy, locus of control, and, to some degree, personality have
been shown to have a relationship to SCCPP adjustment.
SCCPP's understanding, knowledge, and acceptance of the
patient's pain need further examination to explore its impact
on SCCPP adjustment.
With regard to the socioecological construct, numerous
studies have demonstrated the effect of negative responses
from SCCPP on the pain behaviors of the chronic pain
patients (e.g., McCracken & Eccleston, 2005; Romano et al.,
2000). However, how this process affects SCCPP remains
unanswered. Research on the specific types and functions of
formal and informal social support systems that are effective
for SCCPP and chronic pain patients is lacking. In addition,
while there is some evidence for the relationship between
family functioning and caregiver adjustment, this area needs
to be explored further with regard to its application to the
adjustment of chronic pain patients and SCCPP.
Limitations
We acknowledge several limitations in this developing
framework. Specifically, some of the particular pain-related
variables drawn from the literature may show a correlational
instead of a causal relationship to the adjustment of SCCPP.
This is in part due to the paucity of current literature on the
topic as well as a lack of research design sophistication in the
studies that do exist.
In addition, the framework discussed in this article repre-
sents a conceptual, not an empirically validated, path model
of the relationships among all the risk and resistance con-
structs. Therefore, although such a working framework for
SCCPP adjustment provides some conceptual insights into
and awareness of how different constructs are related to
each other and/or may interact with each other in affecting
the adjustment of SCCPP, this framework lacks the empiri-
cal support to clearly delineate the specific strengths of the
mediating and moderating effects among those constructs.
This lacking can be attributed to methodological inade-
quacy. Specifically, there are limited empirical studies that
demonstrate the relationships among constructs, and meth-
odological design may not allow reasonable hypotheses to
be set and tested on the overall model of adjustment. These
variables may not allow a complex model to be tested simul-
taneously using a strong data analysis methodology. In the
risk and resistance variables where no evidence in the
chronic pain literature exists, evidence will be drawn from
other caregiving adjustment literature to demonstrate the
importance of incorporating and testing those variables with
the chronic pain population. In addition, the factors under
each of the constructs are not exhaustive. For instance,
10 SAGE Open
certain demographic factors such as gender, age, ethnicity,
income, and education level are excluded in the current
framework. Other personal and developmental caregiver
factors including history of mental illness, substance abuse,
childhood trauma, and family upbringing are not included.
This does not suggest that those personal factors or other
developmental factors are not important, but such factors
may not fit into the three risk and resistance factors that are
postulated within the framework of the Wallander et al.'s
model.
Applications of Research and Practice
The current framework represents a conceptual model of
the relationships among all the risk and resistance con-
structs and provides some conceptual insights into and
awareness of how these constructs are related and/or may
interact with each other in affecting the adjustment of
SCCPP. We anticipate refining the broader constructs and
factors comprising these risk and resistance constructs as
additional evidence emerges. Due to the fact that few stud-
ies exist with vigorous research design and an adequate
sample size, as well as the likelihood of their exclusion of
some other potential important variables (e.g., health care
accessibility, demographic variables), a perfect picture
becomes difficult to present. In addition, based on the
results of some of the chronic pain literature, the various
risks and resistance constructs appear to have a mediating
or moderating effect on each other, rather than a direct rela-
tionship with all risk and resistance constructs pointing sin-
gly and directly to the outcomes. However, our intention is
to begin this conversation to advocate for evidence-based
studies to demonstrate important constructs and factors that
affect SCCPP adjustment. Other constructs and factors that
we may not have included (e.g., health care availability,
demographic factors) may also be important variables that
affect caregiver adjustment among the chronic pain popula-
tion. Those variables may need to be studied and added to
this working framework.
With vigorous methodological design, empirical evi-
dence among the factors and constructs of each area can be
used to test a larger path model or structural equation model
in which all variables can be tested simultaneously for their
interaction and latent effects. The accumulation of evidence
in supporting each of the constructs, therefore, can help in
building the broader picture of the adjustment of SCCPP.
Finally, this conceptual framework can be used clinically to
help SCCPP understand the potential factors that may put
them at risk and resistance factors that may protect them
from distress when providing care to their spouses with a
chronic pain condition. This conceptual framework may
also provide insights into the types of interventions that will
help the chronic pain patient as well as the SCCPP in adjust-
ment, positive mental health, quality of life, and marital
satisfaction.
