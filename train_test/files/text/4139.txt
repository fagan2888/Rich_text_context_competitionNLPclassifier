Introduction
Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder
affecting approximately 1% of the American
population. It is characterized by an inflamma-
tory immune reaction in the small intestine trig-
gered by consumption of gluten, a protein found
in wheat, barley, and rye. The autoimmune reac-
tion causes flattening of the villi in the small
bowel, leading to malnutrition, anemia, osteo-
porosis, infertility, growth problems in children,
and other disorders. While the clinical manifes-
tations vary greatly, acute exposure to gluten in
CD may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating.
Currently, the only available treatment for CD is
complete elimination of gluten-containing foods
from the diet.1
Gluten's markedly high proline content causes a
complex structure with regions which are largely
inaccessible to human endoproteases, allowing
large, proline-rich gluten fragments to reach the
small intestine intact.2 These large molecules,
the products of gluten digestion, are up to 33
amino acid in length remain. These molecules
include the 33-mer -gliadin and the 26-mer
-gliadin fragments. These particularly toxic
molecules enter the small intestinal lamina pro-
pria, become activated by the enzyme tissue

Abstract
Background: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However,
there is interest among patients in a medical therapy to replace or help with a GFD. Therapies
include gluten-degrading enzymes (glutenases). There are glutenases available marketed as
dietary supplements that have not been demonstrated to digest the toxic epitopes of gluten.
Methods: We investigated the contents, claims, and disclaimers of glutenase products and
assessed patient interest using Google AdWords to obtain Google search frequencies.
Results: Among 14 glutenase product, all contained proteases, eight contained X-prolyl
exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV, two did not state the protease contents, and eight failed
to specify the name or origin of all proteases. Eleven contained carbohydrases and lipases and
three probiotics. One declared wheat and milk as allergens, two contained herbal products
(type not stated) and one Carica papaya. Thirteen claimed to degrade immunogenic gluten
fragments, four claimed to help alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms associated with eating
gluten. Disclaimers included not being evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and
products not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. On Google AdWords,
the search frequency for the product names and the search terms was 3173 searches per
month.
Conclusions: The names of these products make implicit claims that appear to be supported
by the claims on the labels and websites for which there is no scientific basis. Google search
data suggest great interest and therefore possible use by patients with CD. There needs to be
greater oversight of these `drugs'.

transglutaminase that facilitates their binding to
HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 on antigen-presenting T
cells. Binding is optimized with fragments nine
or more amino acids in length. Therefore, reduc-
tion of the immunogenicity of gluten requires
that it be degraded into fragments shorter than
nine amino acids before the protein reaches the
small intestine.3 One therapeutic approach is to
administer prolyl endopeptidases that can com-
pletely degrade gluten in the stomach, minimiz-
ing the presence of the larger toxic gluten
fragments. A few enzymes have been proposed
for this purpose.
Prolyl oligopeptidases from the organisms
Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Sphingomonas
capsulate, and Myxococcus xanthus have shown
promise, being able to successfully degrade
immunogenic gluten amino acid sequences, but
they are optimally active outside gastric pH levels
and are degraded by pepsin,4 rendering these
proteases useless in a gastric environment. A
combination of aspergillopepsin from Aspergillus
niger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), an
X-Pro N-terminal protease from Aspergillus ory-
zae, was found to successfully degrade small
amounts of gluten in vitro.5 ALV003, produced
by Alvine Pharmaceuticals (San Carlos, CA), is a
combination of a cysteine protease from barley
and a prolyl endopeptidase from Sphingomonas
capsulata that has been shown to successfully
degrade immunogenic gluten fragments in the
stomach,6,7 and a synthetic enzyme called
KumaMax from the Institute for Protein Design
at University of Washington (Seattle, WA, USA)
had similar in vitro results to ALV003,8 but is still
under development. Finally, Tolerase G, a com-
mercially available dietary supplement sold by
DSM (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) that contains
Aspergillus niger derived prolyl endoprotease
(AN-PEP), has had very promising in vitro, ex
vivo, and in vitro initial results.8,9
In addition to these gluten-degrading enzymes
(glutenases), there are numerous dietary supple-
ments already on the market that are marketed to
aid in the digestion of gluten and reduce its toxic-
ity. These products are mainly based on DPP-IV,
which has limited proteolytic activity on its own.
They are most prominently marketed to patients
with CD or gluten intolerance who are maintain-
ing a gluten-free diet (GFD) by choice. In this
study, we investigate various aspects of 14 com-
mercially available glutenase products. We show
that these products have minimal published evi-
dence of efficacy and may actually be hazardous
to patients with CD who are taking them.
Methods
Identifying glutenase products
We conducted a Google search for glutenases
using the following terms and variations thereof:
`glutenase', `gluten enzyme', `digest gluten', and
`celiac enzyme'. We used online articles to sup-
plement our search to ultimately find 14 prod-
ucts. Our criteria for glutenase products required
that they be commercially available, enzyme sup-
plements, claim to degrade gluten, and available
in the United States.
Collecting product data
We examined the manufacturers' websites, prod-
uct labels, and other published information and
advertising materials for the glutenase products
to find the following data: active ingredients;
declared allergen content; indications for use;
data supporting efficacy; claims made about the
product; disclaimers; and the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) classification of the
product (i.e. food item, dietary supplement,
drug, etc.).
Google search frequency
We used Google AdWords' Keyword Planner
tool to obtain Google search frequency data. We
looked at search frequency for the glutenase prod-
uct names as well as a few related search terms
(`CD', `gluten free', and the search terms we used
to find the products) for basis of comparison. For
these search terms, we used Google's data for the
latest available six months' preceding data collec-
tion (January 2015­June 2015) to ensure current
data; we limited the inquiry to the United States
for the purpose of keeping the data local; and we
used the data separated by month rather than the
monthly average presented by the Google
AdWords tool to minimize rounding error appar-
ently inherent to Google's calculations.
Results
Active ingredients
Through our Google search, we found 14 glute-
nase products that met our criteria (Table 1). All
S Krishnareddy, K Stier et al.

of the products were classified as dietary supple-
ments and, as such, are exempt from many FDA
labeling standards. We first identified the active
ingredients of each of the products from their
content labels (Table 2). We found that all of the
products contained proteases, while 8 of the 14
products contained the X-prolyl exopeptidase
DPP-IV, and one, Digest Gluten Plus, listed

`gluten specific bacterial protease' content. None
of the products listed aspergillopepsin content.
Two of the products, BioCore DPP IV and
SerenAid, did not clearly enumerate the pro-
tease contents, and eight of the products
(BioCore DPP IV, Digest Gluten Plus, Gluten-
Ade, Gluten Digest, Gluten Enzyme DG,
Gluten-Zyme, Glutenaid, and SerenAid) failed
to specify what one or more of the contained
proteases were.
Eleven of the 14 glutenase products contained
other enzymes, including carbohydrases; Gluten
Cutter had the highest number of carbohydrases
at nine. Five of the products contained lipases,
though no product listed more than one lipase,
nor did any product containing lipases specify
what lipase it contained, nor their sources.
Neither carbohydrases nor lipases degrade glu-
ten proteins.
Three of the products contained probiotics, with
Lactobacillus species occurring in two products.
No other bacterial family was listed as a probiotic
in more than one product.
The FDA requires that dietary supplements
declare any `major allergens' (including wheat)
that may be present in the products. One of the
glutenase products (Digest Gluten Plus) declared
wheat content, as well as milk. As seen in Table 3,
three of the products possibly contained plant
matter, two contained herbal products (type not
stated) and one Carica papaya (a tropical fruit).
Ingredient origins
After the active ingredients, we looked at the ori-
gins of the active ingredients of the glutenase
products (Table 3). Eight of the products used
fungal sources; each of these eight used Aspergillus
oryzae, five used Aspergillus niger, four used
Aspergillus melleus, and two used non-Aspergillus
species alongside Aspergillus species. Two prod-
ucts (Digest Gluten Plus and Gluten-Ade) used
bacterial sources, excluding bacteria used as
probiotics; both of these products used Bacillus
subtilis. Three products used plant sources, two
of which used the plants as herbs, while the third
used a papaya-derived protease. Unfortunately,
we are not aware of where all of the ingredients
come from, as the manufacturers do not list all
of the origins, as is noted in Table 3.
Claims and disclaimers
We then identified the claims and disclaimers the
manufacturers made on the products (Table 4).

Thirteen of the 14 products claimed to degrade
immunogenic gluten fragments, as is the stated
intent of the products; the one product that did
not make this claim actually made no claims
whatsoever. Four products claimed to help allevi-
ate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms associated
with eating gluten. Six products made claims
regarding their activity in a `range of pH' found in
the stomach. No other claims relevant to CD
were made by any of the products.
Along with these three types of claims, the manu-
facturers also included many disclaimers; the
individual products carried as many as five dis-
claimers. The most prevalent disclaimer, present
on 11 of the products, was the standard `These
statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
This product is not intended to diagnose, treat,
cure, or prevent any disease.' Similarly, five prod-
ucts advised that pregnant and breastfeeding
patients take extra precautions, and two products
advised that patients discontinue use if they react
adversely to the product. More notably, however,
one product advised patients to discuss using the
product with their physicians; one said to contact
a physician if gluten sensitivity symptoms persist
while using the product; two products advised
that patients with CD use the products only under
a physician's supervision; and seven products
stated that patients with CD should maintain a
GFD even while using the product.
Search frequency
Using Google AdWords to obtain search frequency
data, we found that the Google search frequencies
for the glutenase products' names is remarkable
(Figure 1). Gluten Cutter had the greatest search
volume at an average of 1397 searches per month
in the United States, which was only 170 searches
less that of `CD' and 55 times lower than that of
`gluten free', the only available therapy for CD. Of
note, the combined search frequencies for the
product names and the search terms we used to
find the products was 3173 searches per month,
only about 75 times lower than that of `CD' and
24 times lower than that of `gluten free'.
Discussion
The GFD is currently the only available proven
treatment for CD, but it is burdensome and a

factor in the quality of life of individuals with
CD.10,11 In addition, most with CD consume glu-
ten either intentionally or unintentionally.12 It is
understandable that those with CD desire and
need alternative therapies to either replace or
assist them with the GFD.13,14 This is also evident
from our data. People are looking for therapies for
CD, given the 3173 searches/month aggregate
Google search frequency for the search terms we
used to find the glutenase products and the prod-
uct names themselves, the results comparable to
searches for information on `CD'. The fact that
we found the 14 glutenase products in this study
using such search terms as `digest gluten' and
`celiac enzyme', among others, demonstrates how
patients with CD may be finding these products.
There has been considerable interest in the
research and pharmaceutical development of
potential therapies for CD.15 A major area of
research is the development of enzyme prepara-
tions that will digest the toxic fragments of glu-
ten in the stomach preventing exposure of these
fragments to the intestinal mucosa.16 The devel-
opment of specific enzymes that digest the toxic
fragments of gluten has advanced considerably
to phase II clinical studies.17 However, the glute-
nases in the commercially available products
that we investigated have not been demonstrated
to digest the immunogenic, toxic fragments of
gluten in the acid milieu of the stomach.3
The glutenase products we investigated almost
unanimously assure degradation of gluten to
minimize or eliminate the effects of consuming
gluten. Many products also claim to diminish
various GI symptoms. Even the names make
implicit claims: Gluten Cutter, Gluten Defense,
GlutenEase, and other similar names hold the
clear suggestion of protection against gluten
consumption. All of these claims may be very
alluring to patients with CD who feel restricted
by the diet. There is very little evidence, how-
ever, that these products actually do what they
claim to do. One paper finds only 64% hydroly-
sis of gluten by a particular enzyme combination

including DPP-IV.18 Another study reports on
DPP-IV degradation of the N terminus of gluten
peptides but does not specify the speed of degra-
dation or efficacy in gastric conditions.19 In
another study, it was specifically found that cur-
rent commercially available glutenases, primar-
ily DPP-IV-based products, are not effective in
degrading the toxic epitopes of gluten; the five
products tested by Janssen and colleagues left
the immunogenic amino acid sequences in glu-
ten completely intact.3 Indeed, it is entirely pos-
sible that any relief patients may experience from
the glutenase products we investigated can be
attributed to the placebo effect or the carbohy-
drases and lipases paired with an underlying,
undiagnosed digestive condition. Thus, the effi-
cacy claims made by the glutenase product man-
ufacturers are misleading and may cause patients
to cause themselves harm by eating gluten while
believing they are protected.
Beyond the apparent lack of efficacy of the glute-
nases, the products in and of themselves may
actually pose a hazard to patients. One of the
products declared wheat content in the allergen
information. This wheat content poses a clear
hazard to patients with CD using the product,
and it is possible that other products contain
undeclared wheat (or other allergens), as the
FDA does not closely monitor these enzyme sup-
plements and their labels. Recent publicity in the
lay press20 has highlighted the high rate of misla-
beling of dietary supplements, lack of the product
on the label detected in the product, and high
rates of product substitution with nondisclosed
items such as wheat, rice, and noxious herbs.21
Previous work done by our group has found that
55% of probiotics contain gluten, despite being
labeled gluten free, and 18% contain more than
the 20 ppm limit for gluten-free foods set by the
FDA,22 creating a potential hazard to patients
with CD. Furthermore, the probiotic content and
bacterial and fungal origins of the glutenase prod-
ucts we investigated are worrisome. The use of
these microorganisms may unintentionally permit
pathogenic contamination of the products, in
addition to inadvertent gluten exposure.23
The array of disclaimers on the products in this
study may be another issue. Eleven of the prod-
ucts actually say that they are `not intended to
diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease', as
part of the standard FDA-mandated disclaimer,
which included CD. These products should be
clearly labeled with disclaimers about use and
risks of use in CD. Furthermore, seven of the
products explicitly state that they are not intended
to replace GFD in patients with CD, along with
other disclaimers which should indicate to these
patients that the drugs are not effective in treating
CD. Two products even advise patients with CD
not to use the product without physician supervi-
sion. Unfortunately, Kesselheim and colleagues24
found that such disclaimers, which should really
serve as warnings, do not consistently communi-
cate the issues they are trying to express. Instead,
these disclaimers are either misunderstood or
simply ignored, causing patients to unwittingly
put themselves at risk. Furthermore, all the prod-
ucts do not contain these disclaimers and should
be made to in order to clearly identify the risk to
patients using these products.
The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety
and efficacy of drugs, medical devices, biological
products, cosmetics, food, and radiation-emitting
products in the USA, but the FDA has little
authority over dietary supplements and is specifi-
cally prevented from closely regulating the indus-
try.25 Product labels and claims are not subject to
the same approval requirements as drug labels
and dietary supplements are not subject to the
same rigorous testing standards. Consequently,
dietary supplement manufacturers have a sub-
stantial amount of latitude in what they can say
and do. For example, dietary supplement labels
may not be as clear as they should be, such as
with the ambiguity in ingredient listings noted in
Table 2. Because of the FDA's limited authority
over dietary supplements, they are not as well
regulated as drugs in terms of safety, consistency,
efficacy, or labeling, and may be at higher risk of
misinformation or even hazardous contents,
including gluten. Although the addition of gluten
to these products is a clear contraindication for
patients with CD, patients with nonceliac gluten
sensitivity might also be sensitive to the amounts
of gluten in these products and should be aware
of these issues.
Tolerase G, the AN-PEP-based supplement, was
not evaluated in this study because it was not
found via the search methods used. This is likely
a result of the time at which the searches were
conducted, the search terms used, and the Google
search algorithm. Tolerase G became commer-
cially available in June, approximately 1 month
prior to when the searches were conducted, which
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)
480 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
may have contributed to the apparent low visibil-
ity through the Google searches. While Tolerase
G effectively reduced the amount of consumed
gluten that was exposed to the duodenum in a
clinical study, it did not completely degrade the
gluten.9 Therefore, it is not an effective treatment
for CD, as no safe concentration of gluten in the
duodenum has been determined, and the same
study even states, `AN-PEP is not intended to
treat or prevent coeliac disease'.9 Tolerase G,
being a dietary supplement, is also not FDA regu-
lated and therefore has the same regulation con-
cerns as the supplements evaluated in this study.
With the potential hazards and lack of evidence of
efficacy of the glutenase products we investigated,
it appears entirely inadvisable for patients with
CD to use the products. Rather, it remains that
the only valid treatment option presently availa-
ble for CD is lifelong adherence to the GFD.
There are, however, some promising therapies
currently being developed in the United States
and Europe that will be required to demonstrate
efficacy and safety in clinical trials. It is most
advisable that patients with CD maintain GFD
while awaiting the approval and production of
safe, properly regulated therapies. We need to ask
all our patients on GFDs with CD or nonceliac
gluten sensitivity about their use of dietary sup-
plements and protect them from this very poorly
regulated industry and specifically the misleading
labeling of these glutenase products, especially as
patients increasingly use the internet to seek med-
ical information.26
