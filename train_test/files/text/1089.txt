Summary
1. Human­elephant conflict (HEC) in Africa occurs wherever these two species co-
incide, and poses serious challenges to wildlife managers, local communities and
elephants alike. Mitigation requires a detailed understanding of underlying patterns
and processes. Although temporal patterns of HEC are relatively predictable, spatial
variation has shown few universal trends, making it difficult to predict where conflict
will take place. While this may be due to unpredictability in male elephant foraging beha-
viour (the male behaviour hypothesis) it may also be due to variations in the data
resolution of earlier studies.
2. This study tested the male behaviour and data resolution hypotheses using HEC data
from a 1000-km2 unprotected elephant range adjacent to the Masai Mara National
Reserve in Kenya. HEC incidents were divided into crop raiding and human deaths or
injuries. Crop raiding was further subdivided into incidents involving only male ele-
phants or family groups. A relatively fine-resolution, systematic, grid-based method
was used to assign the locations of conflict incidents, and spatial relations with under-
lying variables were explored using correlation analysis and logistic regression.
3. Crop raiding was clustered into distinct conflict zones. Both occurrence and intensity
could be predicted on the basis of the area under cultivation and, for male elephant
groups, proximity to major settlements. Conversely, incidents of elephant-induced
human injury and death were less predictable but were correlated with proximity to
roads.
4. A grid-based geographical information system (GIS) with a 25-km2 resolution
utilizing cost-effective data sources, combined with simple statistical tools, was capable
of identifying spatial predictors of HEC. At finer resolutions spatial autocorrelation
compromised the analyses.
5. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that spatial correlates of HEC can
be identified, regardless of the sex of the elephants involved. Moreover, the method
describedhereisfullytransferabletoothersitesforcomparativeanalysisof HEC.Using
these results to map vulnerability will enable the development and deployment of
appropriate conflict mitigation strategies, such as guarding, early warning systems,
barriers and deterrents. The utility of such methods and their strategic deployment
should be assessed alongside alternative land-use and livelihood strategies that limit
cultivation within the elephant range.

Introduction
Many species face increasing competition with people
for space and resources (Pimm et al. 1995; Balmford
et al. 2001). As a result, some are coming into increas-
ing conflict with people, and this is particularly true
of large mammals. Large herbivores, such as the black
rhinoceros Diceros bicornis L., and large carnivores bear
most of the cost of this conflict and are either critically
endangered or declining rapidly (Woodroffe & Ginsberg
1998; Emslie & Brooks 1999). Others, such as the African
elephant Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, also have
considerable impact on people and are in the unusual

position of being simultaneously an endangered species
(IUCN 2000) and, in places, a pest species.
Human­elephant conflict (HEC) may take many
forms, from crop raiding and infrastructural damage,
though disturbance of normal activities such as travel
to work and school, to injury or death of people and
elephants (Hoare 2000). HEC occurs throughout the
elephant range in Africa, both in forest ecosystems in
west and central Africa (Barnes 1996) and savanna eco-
systems in east and southern Africa (Thouless 1994;
O'Connell-Rodwell et al. 2000). HEC is a problem that
poses serious challenges to wildlife managers, local
communities and elephants alike.
The issue of HEC has become increasingly signifi-
cant as human populations have expanded and
encroached upon elephant habitat (Dublin, McShane
& Newby 1997; Hoare & du Toit 1999), particularly
where people practice cultivation. Crop raiding is per-
haps the most common form of HEC. Although nei-
ther the only crop pest in Africa nor the most damaging
overall, elephants may cause severe localized damage
within affected areas and can destroy entire fields
of crops (Barnes, Asika & Asamoah-Boateng 1995;
Hillman-Smith et al. 1995; Lahm 1996; Naughton-
Treves 1998). Moreover, elephants are also dangerous
to people. As a result, elephants have a higher profile
than other wildlife species and are generally less easily
tolerated(Naughton-Treves,Treves&Rose2000; Hoare
2001).
It is vital, therefore, to gain a thorough under-
standing of the problem in order to develop and direct
mitigation strategies. Recent reviews of HEC (Hoare
1999a, 2000) have identified some trends. Conflict usu-
ally takes place between dusk and dawn, and for crop
raiding in particular is often strongly seasonal. Spatial
patterns have been more difficult to identify. Conflict
is generally highest in close proximity to protected
areas that act as elephant refuges (Barnes, Asika &
Asamoah-Boateng 1995; Bhima 1998; Parker &
Osborne2001).However,fewsystematicstudiesof HEC
distribution have been conducted.
Other pest species, including carnivores (Stahl et al.
2002) and birds (Tourenq et al. 2001; Somers & Morris
2002), have exhibited considerable spatial predict-
ability in their patterns of crop and livestock raiding,
enabling appropriate management and mitigation
methods to be applied strategically. The most com-
prehensive published study of HEC, however, failed to
identify any strong spatial correlates (Hoare 1999a).
This suggested that HEC was as much a feature of
unpredictable behaviour by male elephants, respons-
ible for the majority of crop-raiding events in the study
area in Zimbabwe, as of underlying spatial patterns.
This `male behaviour hypothesis' reflects the fact that
male elephants may be more willing to take risks for
the higher nutritional rewards of mature crops
than female elephants, as has been shown for Asian
elephants (Sukumar & Gadgil 1988; Sukumar 1989,
1991).
A similar study in Kenya identified spatial correlates
related to human and elephant density. This was partly
explained because female-led family groups, which
may be more predictable than male elephants, were
more involved in crop raiding in this area (Smith &
Kasiki 1999). It was not possible, however, to separate
incidents caused by male vs. female-led family groups
in order to test this hypothesis. Moreover, the study was
conducted at a finer spatial resolution than that of
Hoare (1999a). Both studies used local government
administrative boundaries to delineate areas to be used
as data points in subsequent analyses, although those
of Smith & Kasiki (1999) were significantly smaller
(median = 121 km2 vs. 448 km2, Mann­Whitney U =
65, z = -4·86, P < 0·001). Aggregating the value of
independent variables such as distance from roads,
water or protected area boundaries over large and
irregular-shaped areas may obscure patterns that
would be evident using a more refined spatial delinea-
tion of data points. Thus the identification of spatial
correlates of HEC intensity in one study and not the
other may be as much a result of differences in spatial
resolution as of differences in the composition of ele-
phant groups involved in HEC.
The aim of this study was to identify whether
spatially explicit predictive models of HEC could be
derived from field monitoring and other available data,
regardless of the composition of the elephant groups
involved. The study tested the alternate male behaviour
and data resolution hypotheses for the apparent unpre-
dictability of HEC in earlier studies. This was achieved
by performing analyses at fine (1 × 1-km and 5 × 5-km)
spatial resolutions and by separating crop-raiding incid-
ents involving all male groups from those involving
female-led family groups. The resolution of the ana-
lyses was further refined compared with earlier studies
by conducting separate analyses on different forms of
HEC (crop raiding vs. human deaths and injuries) that
may have different spatial patterns. The study tested a
simple grid-based geographical information system
(GIS) and statistical analytical procedure not previ-
ously used in HEC research but with the potential for
widespread comparative application.
Materials and methods
STUDY AREA
TransMara District lies in the south-west of Kenya
on the border with Tanzania (0°50-1°50S, 34°35-
35°14E). The district was created out of the western
part of Narok District in 1994 and encompasses the
western portion of the world-famous Masai Mara
National Reserve (MMNR) (Fig. 1). It covers an area
of some 2900 km2, of which approximately 2200 km2 is
an unprotected area inhabited by people separated
from the protected and uninhabited MMNR by a steep
escarpment. Elevation outside of MMNR ranges from
1900 to 2500 m and is characterized by a southern

plateau separated from northern highlands by the
Mogor River and drainage system running north-east
to south-west. Rainfall averages 1200­1500 mm annu-
ally and falls in a bimodal pattern from March to June
and from November to December. There is a north­
south gradient of high to low rainfall across the district
(Sitati 2003).
The natural vegetation is a mosaic of Afro-montane,
semi-deciduous and dry-deciduous forests and
Acacia savanna woodlands (Kiyiapi, Ochieng-Obado &
Otieno-Odek 1996). However, the northern, north-east
and south-west areas of the district have high agri-
cultural potential, and these areas have undergone
significant transformation for cultivation, particularly
of maize and sugar cane. The central area has lower
potential and remains substantially forested, although
it is increasingly affected by slash-and-burn cultivation
and charcoal production. The 1999 census recorded
168 721 people living in TransMara District, with par-
ticularly dense settlement in the north and west where
the traditional, pastoralist Maasai inhabitants have been
joined by an influx of other agro-pastoral ethnic groups.
Land tenure outside of MMNR is a mixture of private
(18%) and communal (group ranch, 82%) ownership.
Elephants once ranged across most parts of Trans-
Mara District and beyond. As immigration, human
population growth and land transformation have
increased around the borders of the district, elephants
have become excluded from these areas (cf. Hoare & du
Toit 1999). As a result, the elephant range outside of
MMNR has gradually contracted to its present area of
approximately 1000 km2 in the centre of the district
(Fig. 1). This area supports a resident population of
approximately 200­300 individuals that appears to be
spatially segregated from the larger population living
mainly within MMNR. It has lower rainfall, agricul-
tural potential and human population density than
other parts of the district but more intact forest.
The conflict between elephants and people over cul-
tivatedcropsbeganwiththeimmigrationof non-Maasais
into TransMara in the 1920s, through land acquisition
and intermarriage with resident Maasai, to exploit the
fertile soils and high rainfall. As the cultivation intro-
duced to the District by these immigrants increased, so
toodidcropraiding,whichhasbecomeaperennialproblem
throughout the 1990s. Equally, both humans and eleph-
ants have suffered injury and death as a result of their
interactions. This TransMara case study therefore rep-
resents a model of a common situation across Africa
where elephants and people co-exist in disharmony.
DATA COLLECTION
Data were collected on both crop-raiding incidents and
human deaths and injuries from March 1999 to August
2000. To establish a reliable and independent conflict

reporting system (Hoare & Mackie 1993; Hoare 1999a),
a team of 10 community members was selected and
trained to enumerate crop-raiding incidents. This cir-
cumvents the problem of overexaggeration of reported
conflictbyfarmersthemselves(Siex&Struhsaker1999).
Each enumerator was stationed at a different location
within the elephant range, to offer widespread coverage
of the area. Any crop-raiding incident within an enu-
merator's area was visited for verification purposes and
to record the location in Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinates using a Garmin GPS12 satellite
navigation unit (Garmin Corp., Ulathe, KA). Further
details of the incident, such as elephant group size and
composition (male groups vs. female-led family
groups; cf. Sukumar & Gadgil 1988) and time of incid-
ent, were recorded from complainants on a stand-
ardized reporting form (Hoare 1999b). Incidents of
human death and injury were similarly recorded.
However, due to the rarity of suchincidentsduringthe
survey period, historic incidents from 1986 onwards
were also investigated. Details of such incidents were
obtained from Kenya Wildlife Service occurrence
books and through participatory rural appraisals
(PRA)withlocalcommunities,andthesiteof eachincid-
ent was revisited to record its exact location. The
UTM coordinates of each incident were imported
into the ArcView v.3·2 GIS software package (ESRI
Inc., Redlands, CA) for manipulation prior to ana-
lysis. Separate layers were created for crop raiding by
male elephants, crop raiding by family groups and
human deaths and injuries.
Data for seven independent variables that might
determine the spatial pattern of HEC by their effect on
human density or elephant density and movement
patterns were obtained from a variety of sources.
Digital road and river vector files derived from 1 : 50 000
topographic sheets and satellite imagery were obtained
from the Organization for German Technical Coopera-
tion (GTZ) in Lolgorien, TransMara District. Digital
polygons of farm and forest cover were obtained from
the same source and updated with ground surveys in 1999.
The locations of market centres were recorded in the
fieldusingtheGlobalPositioningSystem(GPS).Adigital
elevationmodel(DEM)wasderivedfromtheGTOPO30
data available from the Eros Data Centre, Sioux Falls,
SD, USA. Mean human population density in admin-
istrative sublocations within the district was obtained
from the 1999 population census. No elephant density
data were available so this could not be included in the
analyses. Instead the analyses were confined to the area
of known elephant range where elephants were present
for at least part of the year and within which all conflict
incidents occurred (Fig. 1; Sitati 2003).
DATA ANALYSIS
To facilitate data analysis, all variables were imported
intoArcViewandsuperimposedontoa1-km2 gridcover-
ing the whole of the elephant range (a total of 966 grid
cells). The area of each grid cell comprising forest
or cultivation was calculated. The road, river and mar-
ket centre vector files, and forest polygons, were used to
derive raster distance maps at 100-m resolution in
ArcView, and mean distance from each of these fea-
tures was calculated for each 1-km2 grid cell. The DEM
was already at a resolution of 1 km2 and so did not need
to be manipulated. Human population density was at a
coarser resolution and so each grid cell was assigned
the mean density of the sublocation in which it was
located (or the mean of two sublocations where grid
cells overlapped sublocation boundaries).
Analysis was carried out using SPSS v.9 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago,IL)atthelevelof the1-km2 gridcell.Univariate
correlations were conducted using Spearman's rank
correlation (rs
) for comparison with Hoare (1999a).
Because the intensity of different types of HEC exhib-
ited highly skewed distributions among grid cells it was
not possible to use linear regression to identify multi-
variatecorrelates.Instead,eachtypeof HECwas binary
coded into presence and absence for each grid cell, and
analysis was undertaken using multiple stepwise logis-
tic regression (cf. Manel, Williams & Ormerod 2001;
Tourenq et al. 2001), with entry and exit of variables
determined by the Wald statistic with P-values of 0·05
and 0·1, respectively. The relative contribution of vari-
ables to the model was estimated by the R statistic
(Tourenq et al. 2001). Spearman's rank correlation was
used to examine the relationship between predicted
probabilities of HEC occurrence from the logistic
models and actual intensity of HEC in grid cells.
When analysing spatial data there is a danger of
non-independence caused by spatial autocorrelation
(Koenig 1999) whereby adjacent cells share similar
values in the dependent variable. This effect can reduce
the degrees of freedom in the analysis and thus increase
thechancesof typeIerrors(Legendre&Legendre1998),
whereby correlation coefficients appear more signi-
ficant than they actually are. We tested for spatial auto-
correlation in the dependent variables by calculating
Moran's I statistic (Cliff & Ord 1981) using the Crime-
stats v1·1 software package (N. Levine & Associates,
Annandale, VA). The significance of Moran's I was
examined using a Z-test. An autocovariate term was
derived to model spatial autocorrelation explicitly
where it occurred (Augustine, Mugglestone & Buckland
1996). The term used was an inverse Euclidean dis-
tance weighted mean of conflict presence in the eight
surrounding cells of each cell in the grid. This increases
the fit of logistic models where data are spatially auto-
correlated and removes spurious variables from the
analyses. However, caution is still needed in the inter-
pretation of the significance of correlation coefficients
where spatial autocorrelation occurs (Osborne, Alonso
& Bryant 2001). For this reason, we also conducted the
analyses at a coarser (5 × 5-km grid) resolution at which
spatial autocorrelation was less likely to be significant.
Of the 966 1-km2 grid cells, crop raiding by male
groups occurred in 51 cells and by family groups in 91

cells, whilst human deaths and injuries were present in
34 cells. For each analysis the data were divided ran-
domly into a training set to build the model and a test-
ing set to evaluate its performance (Fielding & Bell
1997; Ambrosini et al. 2002). For male crop raiding,
the training set comprised 80 cells (40 presences and 40
absences) and the testing set 886 cells (11 presences and
875 absences). For crop raiding by family groups, the
training set comprised 100 cells (50 presences and 50
absences) and the testing set 866 cells (41 presences and
825 absences). For human deaths and injuries, the
training set comprised 50 cells (25 presences and 25
absences) and the testing set 932 cells (nine presences
and 923 absences). The partition into random training
and testing sets was repeated five times to avoid any
bias in either set (Tourenq et al. 2001).
At the 25-km2 scale only 55 grid cells were available,
and so for each analysis the data were divided into a
training set of 50 cells and a testing set of five cells (two
presences and three absences in each case). The parti-
tion was repeated five times in an adapted jack-knifing
procedure (Suárez-Seoane, Osborne & Alonso 2002),
with a unique set of five testing cells chosen at random
each time from those not chosen in previous partitions.
In this way a testing set of 25 cells was created from five
separate analyses. Model performance on the test-
ing sets was evaluated by calculating the area under the
curve of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots
(Pearce & Ferrier 2000). ROC values range from 0·5 to
1·0. Values above 0·7 indicate a good model fit while
those above 0·9 indicate a highly accurate model (Swets
1988).
Results
CHARACTERISTICS OF ELEPHANT CROP
RAIDING
Elephants in TransMara destroyed a variety of crops
including maize Zea mays L., millet Eleusine coracana
L., sorghum Sorghum vulgare Pers., cassava Manihot
esculenta Crantz., banana Musa domestica L., sugar-
cane Saccherum officinarum L., tomato Lycoposicon
esculentum Mill., kale Brasica spp., pumpkin Curcubita
maxima Duch., potato Ipomea patatas L., tobacco
Nicotina tobacum L. and bean Phaseolus vulgaris L.
A total of 329 crop-raiding incidents was recorded
between March 1999 and August 2000. Crop raiding
occurred exclusively during the hours of darkness from
19:00 to 05:00 h, with a peak at 22:00 h. In accordance
with previous studies (Hoare 1999a), the size of crop-
raiding elephant groups ranged from 1 to 40 (median =
6), with 80% in groups of  10 animals. However, in
contrast to Hoare (1999a), only 2% of incidents involved
lone male elephants. Individual males and male groups
carried out 32% of incidents (n = 105, median group
size = 3, range = 1­9) compared with 79% in Zimbabwe
(Hoare 1999a), while 68% were by family groups (n =
224, median group size = 8, range = 3­40).
SPATIAL PATTERN OF CROP RAIDING
Crop-raiding incidents were highly clustered at the
1-km2 scale (Fig. 2a,b) and exhibited significant
spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0·02 and 0·03
for male crop raiding and family group crop raiding,
respectively; P < 0·0001 in both cases). As a result, the
significance of correlation coefficients in subsequent
analyses at this spatial resolution may be overestimated
and so are not stated (cf. Balmford et al. 2001).

Correlations of crop-raiding intensity with inde-
pendent variables were generally weak (rs
= 0·01­0·32),
especially when compared with correlations with the
autocovariate terms (rs
= 0·446 and 0·542 for male and
family groups, respectively). Equally, the best predictor
of the occurrence of crop raiding in logistic regressions
at this resolution was the autocovariate term (median
R = 0·382 and 0·432, respectively). ROC values for
these models ranged from 0·86 to 0·95 for male groups
and 0·92 to 0·95 for family groups.
At a 25-km2 resolution, spatial autocorrelation was
not significant (Moran's I = -0·003 and 0·013 for male
and family groups, respectively; P > 0·1). Thus an
examination of the significance of spatial correlations
at this scale could be conducted with confidence.
The area under cultivation was positively correlated
with the intensity of crop raiding by both male and
family groups (P < 0·001; Table 1 and Fig. 3). Male
elephant crop raiding was also negatively correlated
with distance from towns (P < 0·01).
Logistic regressions generated significant spatial
models for the occurrence of crop raiding (Table 2).

Crop raiding by family groups was predicted by area
under cultivation alone (ROC = 0·95 ± 0·05). Includ-
ing an autocovariate term did not alter the other vari-
ables in the model nor improve model performance.
Moreover, the predicted probabilities of occurrence of
both male and family group crop raiding were signi-
ficantly positively correlated with the intensity of each
type of crop raiding (rs
= 0·675 and 0·710, respectively;
n = 55, P < 0·001 in both cases; Fig. 4).
HUMAN DEATHS AND INJURIES
In total, 35 incidents of human death (n = 21) and
injury (n = 14) were recorded between 1986 and 2000.
More than 50% of these occurred in the 5 years from
1996 to 2000, and almost all cases occurred during the
hours of darkness.
Human deaths and injuries were less clustered than
crop-raiding incidents (Fig. 2c) but spatial autocor-
relation was still significant at the 1-km2 resolution
(Moran's I = 0·004, P < 0·01). As with crop raiding,
correlationsof theintensityof humandeathsandinjur-
ies with independent variables were weak (rs
= 0·02­
0·24)andthebestpredictorof theoccurrenceof human
deaths and injuries was the autocovariate term (median
R = 0·250, ROC = 0·73­0·86).
At a 25-km2 resolution, spatial autocorrelation was
not significant (Moran's I = -0·016, P > 0·1). The
intensity of human deaths and injuries at this scale was
negatively correlated with distance from roads (P <
0·05; Table 1 and Fig. 5) but in general correlations
with independent variables were weaker than for crop
raiding. No logistic model for the occurrence of human
deaths and injuries could be constructed.

Discussion
This study is the first of its kind to compare the spatial
patterns of different types of HEC. Furthermore, it is
the first to use a systematic, grid-based approach to
analyse spatial patterns. The occurrence of HEC and
its intensity were correlated with a variety of under-
lying spatial variables in TransMara District. The study
identified different correlates of crop raiding and
human deaths and injuries. Moreover, it was possible
to develop predictive models of crop raiding by both
male elephant groups and family groups, suggesting
that male elephants are no less predictable than females.
There are, however, some caveats to this conclusion.
Although crop raiding by both male and family groups
was significantly correlated with the area of each grid
cell under cultivation, that by male groups was also sig-
nificantly correlated with proximity to towns. Since
proximity to towns also reflects increasing human den-
sity on a fine scale, crop raiding close to towns is more
likely to bring elephants into contact with people.
Thus, this relationship with crop raiding by male ele-
phants, but not by family groups, would seem to indi-
cate an increased propensity to take risks by male
elephants (Sukumar & Gadgil 1988). This in turn is
more likely to lead to less predictability in male ele-
phant behaviour. Indeed, although significant correla-
tions were identified, those for male crop raiding were
less strong than those for family groups, and the pre-
dictiveperformanceof resultingspatialmodelswasless
accurate for males. Although possibly due to differ-
ences in prevalence of male vs. family group raiding,
this might nevertheless suggest that all-male groups are
indeed less predictable than female-led groups.
It may be the case that single males are even less
predictable, so that an area with a higher proportion of
single males involved in HEC (e.g. Hoare 1999a) may
reveal few if any spatial correlates. However, results
from elsewhere with a high proportion of single bull
elephants involved in HEC do not support this (Smith
& Kasiki 1999). It seems more likely that data resolu-
tion, and not elephant group composition, is the key to
identifying spatial correlates of HEC.
The pattern of human deaths and injuries was less
predictable than that of crop raiding. This is partly
because such events were less frequent but may also be
due to the fact that underlying variables, including
human and elephant population density and distri-
bution, forest cover and road networks, may have
changed over the 15-year period for which data were
available. The correlation with proximity to the current
road network reflects the fact that such events usually
occurred at night when people were travelling to or
from home along main roads. They represent unfortu-
nate spatial coincidences when elephants have ven-
tured out of forest refuges and crossed roads just as
people were passing by. In around one-third of cases
the human victim had been drinking and was returning
home from a local bar. Despite the fact that no predic-
tivemodelof theoccurrenceof humandeathsandinjur-
ies could be constructed, there is still a recognizable
spatial pattern to the intensity of incidents. The fact
that this pattern was different to that of crop raiding
implies the need to ensure separation of these types of
HEC in future analyses.
At the 1-km2 resolution crop raiding and, to a lesser
extent, human deaths and injuries were spatially clus-
tered. Such localized and persistent elephant crop
raidinghasbeenwitnessedelsewhere(Bell1984; Damiba
& Ables 1993; Naughton-Treves 1998). Part of this
reflects clustering in the underlying variables such as
area under cultivation and distance from roads. Part of
it may reflect proximity to particularly dense elephant
refuges, from which they forage at night. Neither area
of forest nor distance from forest margin predicted the
occurrence or intensity of HEC in our study. However,
these may not be accurate indicators of daytime ele-
phant refuges as elephant density data over the study
area were not available so could not be included in the
analyses. Indeed, local communities reported particu-
larly high elephant densities in refuges close to three of
the major conflict areas. Clustering of crop-raiding

incidents may also reflect the fact that elephants have
long memories (McComb et al. 2001) and often utilize
traditional movement routes (Low 2000) and thus may
return to areas where they remember having success-
fully raided in the past. The role of daytime refuges and
corridors in determining the distribution and intensity
of HEC outside protected areas warrants further study.
Clustering notwithstanding, there were clear rela-
tionships with underlying spatial variables that became
more apparent at the coarser-scale analyses. Although
useful for fine-scale mapping of HEC and identifica-
tion of high conflict zones, data at the 1-km2 resolution
exhibited too much noise and autocorrelation to iden-
tify spatial correlates reliably. At the 25-km2 resolution,
the data were less clustered and so spatial correlates
could be identified with statistical confidence. More-
over, those variables identified as important at this
resolution were also those with the strongest correlation
coefficients at the 1-km2 resolution. This suggests that
a compromise in resolution on statistical grounds does
not affect the identification of underlying relationships
and may improve clarity by reducing noise. Although
coarser than the 1-km2 resolution data, the 25-km2 res-
olution data are still considerably finer overall than the
government administrative units used in previous ana-
lyses (Hoare 1999a; Smith & Kasiki 1999; although the
latter ranged from 9 to 426 km2 the median of 121 km2
was considerably coarser than in this study). It is also
the finest resolution available for some data sets, such
as wildlife and livestock aerial counts (Ottichilo et al.
2000), that may be incorporated into spatial analyses. It
is therefore recommended that a 25-km2 grid is used to
generate spatial units for HEC analysis. When com-
bined with a suitable index of HEC intensity (Hoare
1999a) such a grid would be a useful comparative map-
ping tool that could be applied to areas experiencing
HEC throughout Africa.
A grid-based approach to mapping, combined with
robust statistical models of HEC, could also be used to
predict HEC intensity in other areas or under chang-
ing circumstances. Although logistic models simplify
the data into presence and absence, the correlations
between predicted presence and actual intensity sug-
gest that relative intensity can be inferred using logistic
models. Moreover, the models developed in this study
relied solely on variables such as land cover and dis-
tance from roads and settlements that can be easily and
inexpensively derived from remotely sensed data, top-
ographic maps and simple ground-truthing. This is in
contrast to variables such as human and elephant den-
sity that would require considerable time and resources
to measure at such fine spatial scales. Such models
could easily be developed using the same variables at
the same fine scale resolution in other sites to enable a
more meaningful comparative assessment of factors
affecting HEC across the continent than has been
possible to date. Including some reference to locally
recognized daytime elephant refuges and traditional
movement routes may also increase the strength of
these analyses. When combined with a grid-based GIS,
such models could be useful management tools both
for planning the deployment of mitigation methods and
for future land-use planning as any planned changes can
be incorporated into the models to assess vulnerability.
For example, although the risk of human death and
injury is small it can probably be reduced substantially
with the avoidance, at night, of walking in areas of high
risk, even along main roads. Crop raiding clearly
increases with increasing settlement and cultivation up
to a threshold at which elephants are permanently
excluded (Hoare & du Toit 1999; Smith & Kasiki 1999).
Moreover, the existence of discrete crop-raiding zones
may simplify mitigation strategies by enabling meas-
ures to be focused on the `front line' of farms closest to
elephant refuges (Bell 1984; Sukumar 1989). A range of
traditional, non-fatal methods has been used by com-
munities all over Africa to combat crop raiding. These
include guarding, scaring elephants with light, noise
and smoke and erecting barriers (Hoare 1995, 2001).
Although not 100% effective and subject to habitu-
ation (Bell 1984; Tchamba 1996), focusing a shifting
combination of such methods on the front-line farms
may be the most successful short-term approach to
mitigating this most prevalent form of HEC. Equally,
knowing where to target mitigation measures also
allows for the strategic implementation of early warn-
ing systems that are critical to the success of HEC
mitigation. Comprehensive field tests of the efficacy of
such measures are vital to identify the most appropri-
ate combination.
Wherever people and elephants coincide, however,
HEC will occur. Short-term mitigation can only
reduce, and not eradicate, the problem (O'Connell-
Rodwell et al. 2000). In TransMara the areas of highest
agricultural potential have already been settled exten-
sively and transformed, and this historic elephant
range has been sacrificed. Settlement and cultivation
are now encroaching on the remaining elephant range,
resulting in further HEC. A longer-term solution to the
problem would be to avoid cultivation or extensive
settlement within the remaining elephant range. The
Maasai occupants of the area, who still form the
majority, were not traditionally agriculturalist and
some communities have now begun to approach the
issue of alternatives to cultivation to alleviate conflict.
Tourism is viewed as a significant untapped oppor-
tunity outside of MMNR, within which a large existing
potential client base resides. Elsewhere in Kenya,
communities are developing small-scale tourism as a
wildlife-compatiblelandusethatgeneratesdirecteconomic
benefits from wildlife (Leringato 2001; Ogutu 2002).
For example, communities in Mwaluganje near Mom-
bassa have abandoned cultivation and settlement in an
elephant corridor between protected areas and, with
theassistanceof theKenyaWildlifeService,havedevel-
oped an elephant sanctuary that generates entrance fee
revenue from tourists. Communities in TransMara
bear the costs of living with wildlife without receiving

manyof thebenefitsfromtourisminMMNR(Walpole
& Leader-Williams 2001). They are now beginning to
take it upon themselves to organize community asso-
ciations charged with exploring and developing alter-
natives to cultivation that conserve the remaining
forest whilst generating benefits from both forest and
wildlife. Generating direct tourism benefits from ele-
phants in a low-density, forested area may be difficult in
the absence of trophy hunting, which is not permitted
in Kenya but which can offer considerable benefits to
offset the costs of co-existence (Taylor 1993; Leader-
Williams, Smith & Walpole 2001). However, any altern-
ative to cultivation, such as broader wildlife-based
and cultural tourism, will alleviate HEC and render co-
existence all the more tolerable.
