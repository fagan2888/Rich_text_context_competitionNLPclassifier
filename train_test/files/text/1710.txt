Abstract
Background: Fish consumption has been shown to be inversely associated with
CHD, which may be due to n-3 fatty acids. The n-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, are
naturally found only in marine sources. Dietary intakes of methylmercury from
certain fish have been hypothesized to increase the risk of CHD.
Objective: To investigate the relationship between 30 d fish frequency consump-
tion (assessed by FFQ), total blood Hg concentrations and risk markers of CHD in
women aged 16­49 years participating in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 1999­2002.
Design: Multiple linear regression analyses were used to test (i) the relationships
between 30 d fish frequency consumption and five CHD risk markers, i.e. HDL
cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, TAG and C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP); and (ii) if total blood Hg attenuated any associations between fish
consumption and CHD risk markers in non-pregnant, non-diabetic females aged
16­49 years.
Results: Total 30 d fish frequency consumption was negatively associated with
CRP (b 5 20?10, 95 % CI 20?19, 20?02, P 5 0?015) and positively associated with
HDL-C (b 5 1?40, 95 % CI 0?31, 2?50, P 5 0?014). Adjustment for other risk factors
did not significantly attenuate the associations. Despite the collinearity between
fish and Hg, there is a protective association between fish intake and CHD risk
factors.
Conclusions: The levels of DHA1 EPA and other nutrients in fish may be adequate
to offset the hypothesized risks of heart disease related to ingesting Hg from fish.

NHANES
Fish and fish oils containing the n-3 fatty acids DHA and
EPA have been shown to have cardioprotective attributes
in both healthy individuals and those at high risk of
CHD(1­4). The chief dietary sources of DHA and EPA are
fatty fish such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, tuna,
sardines and salmon, as well as dietary supplements.
Consumption of DHA and EPA and fish containing these
fatty acids has been shown to reduce blood lipid con-
centrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol
(TC) and TAG, and to raise concentrations of HDL
cholesterol (HDL-C)(5­7). n-3 Fatty acid intake is also
associated with a reduction in plasma biomarkers of
inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP)(5). The phy-
siological effects of DHA and EPA include lowering plasma
TAG concentrations, inhibiting plaque formation, decreas-
ing platelet aggregation and reducing arrhythmias(8­10).
Fish also contains methylmercury (MeHg), an environ-
mental contaminant derived from industrial waste and the
burning of fossil fuels. MeHg makes its way into streams,
lakes and oceans where it becomes incorporated into
the food chain of marine animals(11). The main focus of
MeHg has been its effects on neurodevelopment in chil-
dren(12­14). To monitor exposure to MeHg, the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
measured blood and hair Hg concentrations in the sen-
sitive populations of children and women of childbearing
age. There is more recent evidence that, in addition to its
effects on neurodevelopment in children, MeHg may
increase the risk of CHD by promoting the formation of
free radicals and compromising the function of anti-
oxidants that neutralize these agents(15). Therefore, it is
possible that consuming fish contaminated with MeHg
may increase the risk of CHD.
The hypothesis that MeHg attenuates associations
between fish consumption and CHD risk markers remains
unproven. A review of seven epidemiological studies

conducted to date (five in men, one in women and one
with both men and women) suggests an association
between MeHg exposure and greater CHD risk, including
acute myocardial infarction, but none of these studies
addressed the combined effect of fish or n-3 fatty acid
intake and MeHg on risk markers of CHD(15­19). There-
fore the objective of the current study was to investigate
relationships between 30 d frequency of fish intake, total
blood Hg concentrations and risk markers of CHD in
women aged 16­49 years who participated in NHANES
1999­2002. Indicators of CHD risk examined include
blood concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TAG and the
inflammatory marker CRP.
Materials and methods
The NHANES 1999­2002 database was used to investigate
relationships between fish consumption, total blood Hg
and risk markers of CHD in women aged 16­49 years.
The NHANES is a stratified, multistage probability sample
of the civilian non-institutionalized US population which
interviews approximately 5000 people per survey year.
Respondents are interviewed in their homes and also
complete a health examination component in mobile
examination centres. Low-income persons, adolescents
12­19 years of age, African-Americans and Mexican-
Americans are over-sampled(20).
Independent variables
Fish intake of women aged 16­49 years was assessed as
the total number of fish meals reported consumed in a
30 d fish FFQ in the NHANES 1999­2002. The NHANES
participants did not provide data on the portion sizes of
fish reported consumed in the fish FFQ. In the present
analysis, total fish frequency of consumption data for
women aged 16­49 years was grouped into four cate-
gories: 0, 1­4, 5­8 or $9 times/30 d. Shellfish were
omitted from the analysis because they are low in Hg. For
individuals in each of the four fish consumption cate-
gories, mean blood lipids, CRP, total blood Hg and
nutrient concentrations along with descriptive statistics
for selected demographic variables were calculated. The
summary statistics were derived using the 4-year statistical
weights and adjusting for the statistical design of the
survey as recommended by the NHANES analytical
guidelines(20).
Dietary exposure to Hg was evaluated in this study using
total blood Hg concentrations measured in NHANES
1999­2002 female participants aged 16­49 years.
Dependent variables
The dependent variables of interest in this study were TC,
HDL-C and CRP. Because TAG data were available for a
limited number of participants in the NHANES 1999­2002,
a separate sensitivity analysis was conducted using serum
TAG and LDL-C concentrations.
Covariate variables
Covariates were included in the regression models to take
into account demographic, lifestyle and nutritional factors.
Demographic and lifestyle variables were self-reported
unless otherwise noted and included age (grouped for the
present analysis into four categories: 16­19, 20­29, 30­39
and 40­49 years), ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican-American, other Hispanic and
other), BMI (calculated as measured weight in kilograms
divided by the square of measured height in metres),
educational attainment (less than high school, high school
or General Educational Development, greater than high
school), physical activity (separated into low, moderate
and heavy levels of daily activity), prescription drug use
(anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering), serum cotinine
concentrations (a measure of exposure to tobacco) and
medical history of heart disease (physician-diagnosed
diseases). The diagnoses of congestive heart failure, CHD,
angina, heart attack or stroke were categorized as heart
disease. Intake of individual nutrients was derived from
the 24 h dietary recall interview and was based on calcu-
lations by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
Nutrient intakes (energy, fibre, MUFA, SFA, TC, vitamin C,
alcohol and Se) were treated as continuous variables in
all models. Nutrients that were omitted from the models
because they were not significantly associated with the
dependent variables or caused collinearity included pro-
tein, carbohydrate, total fat and total PUFA.
Cohort for analysis
The sample for the present study was limited to women
for whom data for the independent and dependent vari-
ables of interest were available. The NHANES 1999­2002
dataset contains a total of 10 790 women, including
4084 women aged 16­49 years. Our sample was further
restricted to women having measurements for total blood
Hg (n 3637), CRP (n 3608), 24 h dietary recall interview
(n 3458), 30 d fish FFQ (n 3456), TC (n 3434) and HDL-C
(n 3435). LDL-C and TAG data were collected on only a
subset of women, reducing the sample size to 1726 prior
to testing for confounding variables.
Women were excluded from all analyses if they
reported on the demographic questionnaire that they
were pregnant (n 704), if a doctor had told them
they were diabetic (n 104) or if their 24 h dietary recall
interview was coded by NCHS as unreliable (n 207). This
occurred if .25 % of foods reported consumed had
missing descriptive information, .15 % of foods had
missing quantities eaten or if a meal did not include
at least one identified food. In addition, 211 women who
did not have 4-year statistical weights were excluded. The
numbers excluded are not mutually exclusive. After these
adjustments were made, the sample size was reduced to
1245 women for the analysis of the major dependent
variables, while 577 of the 1245 eligible women were
included in the sensitivity analyses for LDL-C and TAG.

Statistical methods
The STATA statistical software package version 7?0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used to conduct
all statistical analyses including the univariate summaries
and multiple regression models. All estimates were derived
using the 4-year statistical weights based upon mobile
examination centre participation and adjusting for survey
design. Regression analyses were conducted using the sur-
vey regression commands in STATA. The distributions of
continuous variables were tested for normality using the
Shapiro­Wilk test and data were transformed to achieve
normality when necessary. Prior to analysis, log transfor-
mations were done on CRP and total blood Hg values, and a
square-root transformation was performed on the total
reported 30d fish food frequency values(21).
The following hypotheses were tested:
1. Fish intake is negatively associated with TC and CRP
concentrations, and positively associated with HDL-C
and total blood Hg concentrations.
2. Total blood Hg will attenuate any associations
demonstrated between fish consumption and CHD
risk markers.
We tested the effects of dietary 24 h intakes of n-3 PUFA
on TC, CRP and HDL-C and the effects of total blood
Hg on these associations; however, all results were not
significant and thus are excluded from the current paper.
The sample was stratified into categories defined by
total frequency of fish consumption in the past 30 d
(0, 1­4, 5­8 and $9 times/30 d). Means of all continuous
variables for each of the three fish-consuming groups
were compared with those of the fish non-consuming
group using the adjusted Wald test.
The associations between total frequency of fish con-
sumption in the past 30 d, blood lipids and CRP con-
centrations were tested using multiple linear regression
analyses. The initial models (Model 1) adjusted for energy
intake and age (separated by decade, with women aged
16­19 years serving as the reference population). To
adjust for potential confounding, subsequent multivariate
models included known CHD risk factors.
Specifically, Model 2 adjusted for the variables in
Model 1 as well as for lifestyle, dietary habits and medical
history of arthritis and CHD. Model 2 also included
adjustments for prescription drug use (anti-inflammatory
or lipid-lowering), ethnicity, educational attainment
(indicator variables) and continuous variables such as
BMI, smoking (measured as serum cotinine) and 24 h
dietary recall interview intakes of total energy, fibre, SFA,
MUFA, vitamin C, Se and alcohol (continuous variables).
Model 3 included total blood Hg concentrations (log) in
addition to the variables included in Model 2. The analyses
were conducted separately for each of the blood lipids and
CRP. The sample for all multiple linear regression analyses
was limited to women aged 16­49 years with valid data for
all variables included in Model 3 (n 1245).

of 26?3 (SE 0?22) kg/m2. The reported average daily energy
intake of the sample was slightly less than 8500kJ/d
(2000kcal/d), i.e. 8341 (SE 106?7) kJ/d. The study sample
reported an average of 2?9 (SE 0?13) fish meals over 30d
(less than one fish meal per week) and had an average
DHA1EPA intake of 0?1 (SE 0?01) g calculated from the 24h
dietary recall interview, confirming a low fish intake.
The majority of the sample of women aged 16­49 years
consumed fish 1­4 times/30 d. Study participants who
classified themselves as `other Hispanic' and `other' had
the greatest percentage of regular fish consumers (fish $9
times/30 d; 10 %). The data also suggested that fish con-
sumers were less likely to smoke and to be exposed to
second-hand smoke (Table 1).
Of the blood lipids tested, HDL-C concentrations were
higher in the fish consumption groups compared with the
fish non-consumers (P 5 0?0011), while no differences
existed across groups for any of the other lipids or CRP
(Table 3). The women in this sample had desirable
average blood lipid profiles; TC was 188?4 (SE 1?4) mg/dl
and HDL-C was 55?7 (SE 0?7) mg/dl. The average CRP was
0?36 (SE 0?02) mg/l, below the value of 1 mg/l which
indicates inflammation(22).
Total blood Hg concentrations increased gradually for
each fish consumption group, with fish consumers having
significantly greater concentrations than fish non-con-
sumers (Table 3). Regular fish consumers ($9 times/30 d)
had a seven-fold greater total blood Hg concentration
than fish non-consumers (4?2 (SE 0?7) v. 0?6 (SE 0?05) mg/l).
The associations between total blood log-transformed
Hg concentrations and demographic variables were ana-
lysed using multiple linear regression analyses (Table 4).
Women in the 30­39 years and 40­49 years age categories
had significantly greater total blood Hg concentrations

than women aged 16­19 years. Compared with the other
race/ethnicity groups, non-Hispanic blacks had sig-
nificantly greater total blood Hg concentrations (b 5 0?36,
95 % CI 0?14, 0?58). After adjusting for age, energy, BMI,
education, ethnicity, physical activity, prescription drug
use (anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering), serum cotinine,
vitamin C, Se, fibre, alcohol, MUFA and SFA, total blood
Hg concentrations were significantly higher in all fish
consumption groups compared with the fish non-eaters,
indicating a high correlation between fish intake and total
blood Hg concentrations.
Fish consumption, C-reactive protein and
lipid profile
Initial analyses adjusting for age and energy demonstrated
significant negative associations between total 30 d fre-
quency of fish consumption and CRP concentrations
(b 5 20?10, 95 % CI 20?19, 20?02) and significant posi-
tive associations with HDL-C concentrations (b 5 1?40,
95 % CI 0?31, 2?50). After adjustments for known risk
factors for CHD (BMI, educational attainment, ethnicity,
self-reported physical activity, self-reported use of anti-
inflammatory or lipid-lowering prescription drugs, serum
cotinine, vitamin C, Se, fibre, alcohol, MUFA and SFA),
there were no changes in the associations between
30 d frequency of fish consumption and CRP, but
some attenuation with HDL-C concentrations (Table 5).
There were no associations between 30 d frequency of
fish consumption and TC and LDL-C in all models
(P . 0?05).
Sensitivity analyses conducted on the subset of women
aged 16­49 years with measured data for TAG (n 577)
demonstrated that after adjustment for age and other
known CHD risk factors, 30 d frequency of fish con-
sumption was negatively associated with TAG con-
centrations (b 5 24?20, 95 % CI 28?00, 20?33; Table 5).
Fish consumption, C-reactive protein, blood lipids
and total blood Hg
The addition of total blood Hg in Model 3 for CRP did not
change the significant inverse association between fish
consumption and CRP concentrations (b 5 20?10, 95 %
CI 20?18, 20?03; Table 5). To test this effect and control
for total blood Hg, we calculated the average CRP con-
centration by fish non-consumer or fish consumer group
and tertile of total blood Hg concentration (Table 6).
Despite the findings that CRP concentrations among
infrequent fish consumers were higher than for other
groups (Table 3), this analysis, which controlled for total
blood Hg, showed that as Hg concentrations increased
there was no significant change in CRP concentrations or
in the association between CRP and fish consumption.
This was most likely due to the categorization of all fish
consumers into one group. The unweighted sample sizes
were not adequate to conduct the analysis broken down
by fish consumption levels.
The addition of total blood Hg in the Model 3 regres-
sion analyses showed attenuation of the associa-
tion between total 30 d frequency of fish consumption
and HDL-C concentrations to non-significant levels
(b 5 0?48, 95 % CI 20?60, 1?60, P 5 0?372; Table 5). To test
this attenuation effect we calculated the mean HDL-C for
fish non-consumers and fish consumers separated
by tertile of total blood Hg concentration. Analyses of
the association between fish consumption and HDL-C
levels, controlling for Hg levels, showed that that the
difference in HDL-C concentrations between fish non-
consumers and consumers across Hg tertiles did not
decrease, implying that total blood Hg did not diminish
the positive association between fish intake and HDL-C
(Table 7).

resulted in a non-significant association between total fre-
quency of fish and TAG concentrations (b522?30, 95% CI
25?90, 1?20, P50?183; Table 5). A follow-up analysis to test
this effect controlling for total blood Hg (i.e. calculated
average TAG by tertile of total blood Hg and fish con-
sumption category) showed a decrease in TAG for each
tertile of total blood Hg, again demonstrating the high col-
linearity between fish consumption and total blood Hg
concentrations (103?8, 102?4 and 94?6mg/dl per tertile of
total blood Hg). Despite the high collinearity, the TAG
concentrations for fish consumers were consistently lower
than those of fish non-consumers (99?7 v. 102?3mg/dl).

Discussion
The results of the present study suggest an association
between frequent fish intake and selected risk markers of
CHD (HDL-C, TAG and CRP) in women aged 16­49 years.
As the total 30 d frequency of fish consumption increased,
concentrations of HDL-C increased while concentrations
of TAG and CRP decreased. When total blood Hg was
introduced into the regression models, the significant
associations between frequent fish intake and CRP
remained the same although the association with HDL-C
was diminished. Further analyses controlling for total
blood Hg demonstrated that this latter effect is most likely
due to collinearity between fish intake and total blood
Hg. There was no longer an association between fish
consumption and TAG once the total blood Hg and fish
interaction was added to the model. This may be attrib-
uted to the small sample size since the TAG analyses were
conducted on a subset of the population, or it may be
possible that adding Hg to the model may have led to
over-controlling for variables as Hg and fish consump-
tion are highly correlated. No significant associations
were seen between fish intake and either LDL-C or TC
concentrations.
Consumption of DHA and EPA and fish containing
these fatty acids has been shown to reduce blood con-
centrations of LDL-C, TC and TAG and to raise con-
centrations of HDL-C(5­7). The average DHA 1 EPA intake
in our study (0?1 g/d) was much lower in comparison to
that of other studies. Our results agree with other studies
which have shown that fish intake or markers of fish
intake (plasma PUFA) do not significantly impact LDL-C
or TC levels(17,23). The 24 h calculated DHA 1 EPA intake
in our study was also less than the American Heart
Association (AHA) recommendation (at least 0?5­1?0 g of
n-3 fatty acids daily to achieve cardioprotective effects),
which may explain the lack of association in the models
where HDL-C, LDL-C and TC were the independent
variables(24). When 24 h dietary intake of DHA 1 EPA was
used as a marker of fish consumption there were no
associations with risk markers of CHD. The lack of
association may be due to the fact that fish intake is
variable and a single 24 h recall does not capture foods
that are eaten on an irregular basis.
Organic (methyl) Hg is present in fish due to its uptake
from environmental sources(11). In man, the sole source
of exposure to organic Hg is the consumption of fish and
sea mammals(12). Research has linked Hg ingestion from
fish to increased risk of CHD in men(15­17,23,25). In our
study of women aged 16­49 years we found a protective
association between fish intake and CHD risk factors.
Analyses of the association between fish consumption
and HDL-C levels, controlling for Hg levels, showed that
the difference in HDL-C concentrations between fish non-
consumers and consumers across Hg tertiles did not
decrease, implying that Hg did not diminish the positive
association between fish intake and HDL-C. Inconsistent
relationships between biomarkers of Hg and CHD risk
have been reported, perhaps due to differences in the
ages of the study subjects, frequency of fish consumption
among populations studied, type of fish consumed and
health status of the study samples(18,23,26).
CRP is a predictor of CHD risk(27) and is affected by
numerous lifestyle variables. In general, individuals with
elevated CRP concentrations tend to smoke, have high
blood pressure, are overweight and fail to exercise(28). A
few studies have evaluated the effects of dietary intakes of
DHA 1 EPA on CRP concentrations and other biomarkers
of inflammation in different samples of subjects and have
produced varying results(29,30).
The present cross-sectional study extends the results of
previous studies using the NHANES data set (1999­2000).
The average total blood Hg was higher for the 1245
women (aged 16­49 years) in the current study than Hg
levels reported from the same data set using a different
sample of 1709 women (1?6 v. 1?02 mg Hg/l)(31). Schober
et al. also reported that women who ate 3 or more
servings of fish (in the past 30 d) had four-fold greater
geometric mean Hg concentrations compared with
women not consuming fish(31). A second study that ana-
lysed hair Hg data reported three-fold higher hair Hg
concentrations in frequent fish consumers ($3 times in
the past 30 d) than in non-consumers(32). In the current
study, there was a seven-fold difference in total blood Hg
concentration between women who consumed fish $9
times/30 d and the fish non-consumers. The differences
between studies are most likely due to how the fish
consumption groups are stratified and the sample sizes
within these groups.
When total blood Hg data were analysed by race/
ethnicity, the results of the current study are consistent
with two recent reports that analysed relationships
between calculated organic blood Hg (rather than total
blood Hg concentrations), hair Hg concentrations and
fish intake during the first two years of the NHANES
(1999­2000)(32,33). The lowest blood organic Hg con-
centrations were in Mexican-Americans and the highest
concentrations were in participants who designated
themselves in the `other' racial/ethnic category, which
included Asians, Native Americans and Pacific Islan-
ders(33). Mahaffey et al. reported that women aged 30­49
years have blood organic Hg concentrations 1?5 times
greater than women aged 16­29 years(33). Similarly, we
found a two-fold difference in total blood Hg con-
centrations between women aged 16­19 and 30­39 years
(1?0 (SE 0?1) v. 2?0 (SE 0?3) mg/l).
Only fifty-seven women in our sample reported con-
suming fish $9 times in the past 30 d, a frequency similar
to the AHA recommendation of eating fish at least twice
weekly. Most of the women were either fish non-con-
sumers (n 441) or light fish consumers (1­4 times/30 d,
n 166), and thus failed to meet the AHA guideline for fish.

Our study was limited to a sub-sample of women aged
16­49 years in the NHANES (1999­2002) data set for
whom total blood Hg data were available. Therefore,
these results cannot be generalized to other population
groups. Inherent to a large cross-sectional study is the
temporality of the data; therefore, in the present obser-
vational and cross-sectional study we cannot exclude the
possibility that the association between fish and CHD risk
factors may be due to unmeasured variables. However,
we controlled for all variables currently known to affect
risk of CHD. Alternatively, the study would have been
strengthened if actual disease endpoints could have been
used; however, the age group of the study sample was
prohibitive of such analysis.
n-6 and n-3 PUFA compete during metabolism and an
excessive intake of n-6 fatty acids may attenuate the
cardioprotective benefits normally seen with n-3 PUFA.
In a large prospective cohort study, Mozaffarian et al.
investigated the joint effects of different PUFA on the risk
of CHD in men. These researchers saw benefits in the
combination of plant- and marine-based n-3 PUFA on
CHD risk independent of n-6 PUFA consumption. They
concluded that non-marine-based n-3 PUFA are beneficial
in reducing risk of CHD, especially when populations do
not have easy access or availability to marine sources(34).
The interplay of plant-derived and marine-derived n-3
fatty acids was not analysed in the current study.
The results of the present study would have been
strengthened if data on LDL-C and TAG had been avail-
able for more subjects, since both of these lipid bio-
markers may be affected by n-3 PUFA(12). However, the
analysis on a subpopulation did not show any association
between n-3 fatty acids and these blood lipids. Other
inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 or other cytokines
may be better indicators of CHD risk than CRP, but these
data were not available in the current NHANES surveys.
A strength of the current study is that a 30 d frequency of
fish intake was used which provides a good estimate of
habitual intake. Also, the current study included healthy
women of childbearing age, whereas studies that examined
the joint association between fish intake, MeHg and CHD
only included men and older women. Finally, because the
NHANES data set is large, we were able to control for a
number of demographic and lifestyle variables.
Summary
The results of the present study provide further support for
recommending regular fish consumption along with main-
taining a healthy lifestyle (e.g. not smoking and getting daily
moderate exercise) as a way of reducing the risk of CHD.
The effect of Hg on biomarkers of inflammation is unclear.
Based on this study and others, it appears that the levels of
Hg in fish consumed by this population may not be high
enough to counteract the positive association between fish
intake and CHD risk factors.
