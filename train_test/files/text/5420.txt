Abstract
Objectives: To assess the effect of treatment guidance based on data from a continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) device on glycaemic control, and patient satisfaction, in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: Patients with poorly-controlled T2DM treated with insulin were randomly assigned to the
intervention or nonintervention group. Continuous blood-glucose levels were recorded for 4­5 days
using a CGM device on three separate occasions during the 8-month study period. The intervention
group received treatment guidance based on the CGM data; the nonintervention group received advice
based on blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c
) levels.

Results: A total of 34 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean Æ SD baseline HbA1c
was
8.2 Æ 1.2% in the intervention group and 8.2 Æ 0.9% in the nonintervention group. At the study
end, there was no significant difference in the change from baseline of HbA1c
between the two
groups. There was also no significant difference in the change from baseline in the Diabetes
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score between the two groups.
Conclusions: The present study did not demonstrate that treatment guidance using retrospective
CGM data was effective for improving glycaemic control and therapeutic satisfaction in Japanese
patients with T2DM.

Introduction
In Japan, the estimated number of people
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
reached 10.7 million in 2011, which is the
sixth largest population of patients with
T2DM in the world.1 Considering the pres-
ence of a large number of patients with poor
glycaemic control, improvement in T2DM
management is an urgent matter in Japan, as
it is in other countries.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
technology provides maximum information
about fluctuations in blood glucose by
the continuous analysis of the interstitial
glucose level throughout the day.2 CGM
has the potential to change the approach
used to educate patients with T2DM.3
Since the United States Food and Drug
Administration approved a CGM device in
1999, the technology has improved; real-
time CGM and insulin pump-integrated
systems (with sensor-augmented pumps)
have become commercially available in the
United States and Europe, in addition to
retrospective CGM.4 A number of import-
ant studies have investigated the use of
CGM in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and
T2DM in the United States and Europe.5­8
Moreover, the 2014 Clinical Practice
Recommendations of the American Diabetes
Association stated that the proper use of
CGM, in conjunction with an intensive insulin
regimen, results in lowering glycosylated
haemoglobin (HbA1c
) in selected adults (age
!25 years) with T1DM (level A; clear evi-
dence).9 In contrast, the history of CGM use in
Japan is relatively short, since the device was
only approved by the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare in 2009, $10 years after
its introduction in the United States. Until the
beginning of 2015, only the retrospective
CGM device was available in general
Japanese hospitals, and in February 2015, a
sensor-augmented pump was finally intro-
duced to the Japanese market. However,
there are no studies on the usefulness of
treatment guidance using CGM for glycaemic
control in Japanese patients, especially in those
with T2DM. Consequently, the present study
investigated whether the iProÕ2 (a wireless
retrospective CGM device; the most popular
CGM in Japan), is useful for glycaemic control
and therapeutic satisfaction in Japanese people
with T2DM receiving insulin treatment.
Patients and methods
Study population
Patients who fulfilled the following inclusion
criteria at registration were included in the
study: (i) patients with T2DM on insulin
injection therapy; (ii) age > 20 years; (iii)
regular visitors to the outpatient clinic at
110 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan
between December 2012 and April 2014;
(iv) HbA1c
(National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program [NGSP]) ranged
between 6.9% and 11.0% over a period of 3
months prior to study enrolment; HbA1c
fluctuations were within Æ 0.5% over the
same time period. The above selected patients
with T2DM were excluded from the study
when any of the following conditions was
diagnosed at registration: (i) proliferative ret-
inopathy; (ii) serious liver disease (aspartate
aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotrans-
ferase levels>100 IU/l); (iii) serious kidney
disease (serum creatinine level >2.0 mg/dl);
(iv) acute heart failure; (v) active malignancy;
(vi) serious pancreatic disease; (vii) preg-
nancy; (viii) serious infectious disease; (ix)
trauma injury.
Study design
This was an open-label, two-arm, rando-
mized controlled study. Patients meeting the
above criteria were assigned randomly by a
computer-generated method to either the
intervention (I) group or the noninterven-
tion (N-I) group. None of the patients had
used a CGM device within 1 year prior to
the start of the clinical trial. According to
previous reports,5,10,11 the HbA1c
levels
decreased from the baseline after interven-
tion using CGM by variable amounts
(0.5% ­ 1.2%). After considering these
changes, the difference in HbA1c
reduction
between the two groups in this study was
estimated as 0.7% with an SD of 0.6.
Considering a two-sided a-level of 5% and
a power (1-b) of 90%, the appropriate
number of patients was considered to be 34
(17 patients per study group).
Patients were asked to visit the hospital $5
days before the start of the study period, and
were equipped with a wireless retrospective
CGM device (iProÕ2; Medtronic, Northridge,
CA, USA) with the aid of medical staff.12 In
the present study, all patients applied the
CGM to continuously record 4­5 days of
data before every visit, including a recording at
baseline. This type of recording was repeated
twice throughout the duration of the study ($8
months) (Figure 1).
During each 4­5-day CGM recording
period using the iProÕ2, patients in both
study groups were instructed to undertake
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
three times using a handheld blood glucose
meter (GlutestÕ Neo Super; Sanwa Kagaku
Kenkyusho, Nagoya, Japan) on the first and
last days and four times on the other days
for calibration purposes. Patients were also
asked to keep a diary that recorded the
amount and type of food consumed every day.
The proportion of time spent with blood
glucose levels <70mg/dl, 70­140mg/dl, and
>140mg/dl as determined by CGM was
calculated using the following equation: pro-
portion of time spent in range (%)¼ time
spent in range (<70mg/dl, 70­140mg/dl, or
>140mg/dl)/total time of measurementÂ 100.
At the scheduled outpatient clinic appoint-
ment, patients handed the CGM and SMBG
data to the study team for downloading. Data
from three consecutive days from the second
day of the CGM recording period were used
to compute the blood glucose levels. For
patients in the I group, two trained diabetol-
ogists from the study team provided guidance
during an interview with the patient of at least
a 15-min duration, where they discussed a
treatment strategy in terms of lifestyle
changes using a printout of the patient's
CGM data, in addition to the usual routine
clinical examination (range, 5­10min). This
15-min guidance interview included at least
three processes: (i) the trained diabetologists
from the study team used a printout of the
patient's CGM data to explain when blood
glucose levels were >140 mg/dl and/or
<70mg/dl; (ii) the patient was encouraged
to find the reasons for high or low blood
glucose levels in front of the trained diabetol-
ogist from the study team; (iii) the patient was
provided with instructions about improving
Sato et al. 111
his/her blood glucose levels, primarily by
changing his/her lifestyle and secondarily by
changing the dose of insulin or other medica-
tions. Suggestions made by the study team
were written down on paper for the patients
and physicians. The physician in charge then
decided whether or not to adopt the sugges-
tions when they were discussed with the
patient during the routine visit. In the N-I
group, both the patients and physicians in
charge were prohibited from seeing the CGM
data until the end of the study, so the
treatment strategy for the N-I group was
decided based on the results of routine blood
tests such as HbA1c
and blood glucose
analysis.
The routine visit with the physicians in
charge was usually scheduled once every
2 months; only the physicians in charge could
change the insulin dose and other medica-
tions. Blood and urine tests, and measurement
of body weight and body mass index, were
performed using standard methods at every
visit. Blood pressure was measured using
routine methods. Serum lipids (total choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tri-
glycerides) were quantified using an automatic
biochemistry analyser (LABOSPECTÕ 008
Hitachi Automatic Analyzer; Hitachi High-
Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). HbA1c
(NGSP)
was quantified using a high-performance
liquid chromatography analyser (HLC-723Õ
G8; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan).
Patients were instructed at the beginning
and end of the study to complete the Diabetes
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire
(DTSQ).13
The primary endpoint was a change in
HbA1c
level from baseline. The secondary
endpoint was a change in the DTSQ score
from baseline. The study protocol was
approved by the Human Ethics Committee

Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the nonintervention group. Patients visited the
hospital every 2 months for blood tests; CGM recording was performed three times prior to these visits
throughout the 8-month study period. The patients were also instructed to complete the Diabetes Treatment
Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) at the beginning and end of the study.

(No. 25­388). Written informed consent
was obtained from each patient before
enrolment in the study. This study was
registered with the University Hospital
Medical Information Network in Japan
(UMIN: 000012034).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using
the JMPÕ statistical discovery software
package, version 10.0.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA). Data were expressed as
mean Æ SD for normally distributed data
and median (interquartile range) for data
with skewed distribution. The Mann­
Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank
test were used for data analysis. A P-
value <0.05 denoted the presence of a stat-
istically significant difference.
Results
A total of 34 patients meeting the inclusion
criteria were assigned randomly to either the
I group (n ¼ 17) or the N-I group (n ¼ 17).
All of the patients completed the study
(Figure 2). Table 1 summarizes the baseline
demographic and clinical characteristics of
the two study groups. There were no signifi-
cant differences between the two groups at

Changes in HbA1c
levels over time are
shown in Table 2. Such changes were not
significantly different between two groups
for any of the time intervals. Other param-
eters related to diabetes management (such
as body mass index, blood pressure, total
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol and triglyceride levels) were not sig-
nificantly different at the end of the study
relative to the baseline (data not shown).
Blood glucose concentrations obtained
from the CGM devices for the I and the N-I
groups are presented in Table 3. There were
no significant differences in maximum and
median blood glucose levels between the two
groups.
Table 3 also shows the percentage of time

>140 mg/dl, 70­140 mg/dl and <70 mg/dl
within a 24-h time period, based on data
from three consecutive days from the second
day of the CGM recording period. The
percentage of time spent >140 mg/dl
decreased from 68.5% at baseline to 56.0%
at the end of the study in the I group, and
from 63.5% to 51.0% in the N-I group. The
percentage of time spent at 70­140 mg/dl
increased from 31.5% to 44.0% in the I
group and from 36.5% to 46.0% in the N-I
group. These changes were not significantly
different between the two groups. The per-
centage of time spent <70 mg/dl was almost
0% in both groups.

Discussion
The present study investigated the effects of
changes in treatment based on retrospective
CGM data on glycaemic control and treat-
ment satisfaction in patients with T2DM
treated with insulin. In these patients, the
results indicated that treatment guidance
using retrospective CGM data was not
useful with regard to improving people's
therapeutic outcome, specifically their
HbA1c
levels.
In this present study, the mean BMI of
the study population was 27 kg/m2.
According to data from the Japan Diabetes
Clinical Data Management Study Group,
the mean BMI of Japanese patients with
T2DM was 22.7 kg/m2 for men and 23.3 kg/
m2 for women.14 In comparison, the patients
in the present study were relatively obese. In
addition, the baseline HbA1c
was >8% and
the duration of T2DM was >16 years,
indicating that patients in this present
study were obese with poorly controlled
T2DM. CGM data showed that over half
of the 24-h blood glucose sampling period
was spent with a blood glucose concentration
>140 mg/dl, but almost none of the time was
spent with blood glucose concentrations at
hypoglycaemic levels (<70mg/dl). Given that
CGM is useful for detecting unrecognised
episodes of hypoglycaemia, it is likely that
these patients tried to avoid hypoglycaemia
during treatment, probably based on advice
from their physicians.
In a study of patients with T1DM, the use
of real-time CGM and intensive insulin regi-
mens resulted in reduced HbA1c
levels.9,15
Another study also showed the usefulness of
retrospective CGM for T1DM.6 In the case of
patients with T1DM, the dose of insulin can
be easily increased if levels of hyperglycaemia
suggest a deficiency of the insulin effect. In
this present study, physicians increased the
insulin dose by 2.2 Æ 4.4 IU/day in the I group
and 0.2Æ 3.0 IU/day in the N-I group
throughout the study period. This change in
insulin dose was not clinically meaningful
with regard to causing an improvement in
glycaemic control. The small change in insulin
probably reflected the physicians' desires to
avoid further body weight gain (caused by
overdosing of insulin) in obese patients. It is
also possible that physicians preferred their
patients to change their lifestyles regarding
diet and exercise rather than try aggressive
insulin titration. However, no significant
body weight reduction was noted in this
study, indicating that the clinical management
aided by the CGM data used in this study did
not satisfactorily change the lifestyle of
patients. There are some important studies
indicating that CGM is useful for specific
populations such as pregnant women5 and
patients on haemodialysis.8 In contrast,
unstructured retrospective use of CGM does
not provide any benefit for glycaemic control
in people with uncontrolled diabetes.7
Based on changes in DTSQ scores, CGM
intervention did not significantly improve
patient satisfaction. There was a tendency
for less satisfaction expressed by patients in
the I group compared with the N-I group at
the end of the study, although the difference
between the two groups was not significant.
This could be due to the fact that the score
for the perception of the frequency of
hyperglycaemia at the end of the study was
significantly increased in the I group com-
pared with the N-I group. Patients in the
I group could have become much more con-
scious about blood glucose levels based on the
close observation of their CGM data, and they
were not satisfied with the results of treatment
because of the psychological burden.
Patients with diabetes are at risk of emo-
tional problems, such as depression and
diabetes-related distress.16­18 Studies have
found that SMBG increased the likelihood
of depression and did not improve diabetes
control.19,20 However, in the Structured
118 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
Testing Program (STeP) study, strictly `struc-
tured SMBG' for three consecutive days
tended to have a positive impact on psycho-
social outcome and reductions in HbA1c
relative to the control group.21 In the STeP
study, patients received training before the
study on how to respond to the results of
SMBG.21 Each of the participating phys-
icians also received training on the correct
interpretation of the structured data and was
provided with an algorithm that described
various pharmacological and lifestyle treat-
ment strategies.21 This suggests that `struc-
tured SMBG' seems to be the true key for
improvement. The intervention in the present
study involved 15-min consultations with
instructions provided by the trained diabe-
tologists, but the patients and physicians in
charge did not receive training before the
study. It is possible that the three 15-min
consultations throughout the study course
did not help patients in making meaningful
interpretations of their blood glucose levels
measured by the CGM, or in improving their
diabetes control. If patients in this current
study were unable to manage their blood
glucose levels using the CGM data, it would
be understandable that they might have felt
guilty about having high blood glucose levels
and then subsequently experienced dissatis-
faction during the study. Construction of
`structured CGM' with some algorithms, for
the physicians and the patients, describing
various treatment strategies to improve psy-
chosocial and diabetes control might be
necessary.
This present study had a number of
limitations. First, it did not evaluate the
usefulness of CGM for avoiding nocturnal
hypoglycaemia based on proper basal insulin
titration, because almost none of the patients
presented with hypoglycaemia. Secondly, the
study did not evaluate lifestyle changes made
in response to the CGM data. Thirdly, the
sample size was small and further studies that
include larger populations are needed to
confirm the present findings.
In conclusion, this present study showed
that treatment guidance using retrospective
CGM data neither improved glycaemic
control nor therapeutic outcome in obese
poorly-controlled patients with T2DM
treated with insulin at an outpatient clinic.
To elucidate the usefulness of CGM data,
further studies are needed to develop effect-
ive interventions by using retrospective
or real-time CGM for the improvement
of diabetes control and therapeutic satisfac-
tion, in Japanese outpatients with T2DM.
