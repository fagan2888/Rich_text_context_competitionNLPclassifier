OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of methods of age grouping on estimates of
overweight prevalence for children and adolescents based on reference body mass index (BMI) percentiles.
METHODS: Data for children aged 6 ± 17 y came from three nationally representative US surveys, the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 ± 1994) and Cycles II and III of the National Health Examination Survey
(1963 ± 1965, 1966 ± 1970). Month-speci®c BMI percentile values were taken from the revised US growth charts. Ages
were grouped into categories 3, 6 or 12 months in length. Cut-off points were selected as the low or the mean
percentile value within the category. Overweight prevalences for these groupings were compared with prevalences
calculated using the month-speci®c values.
RESULTS: The effects of grouping and cut-off point selection on overweight prevalence estimates were generally
small; however, the combination of 12 month groupings and the low value led to an overestimation by up to 3
percentage points. Within the 12 month groupings, the ®rst 6 months differed systematically from the second
6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Although age categorization may often have little effect on prevalence estimates, prevalence may
sometimes be overestimated by as much as 3 percentage points. Use of narrower age categorizations than those used
to construct the reference values may result in systematic biases. It is important to understand how age was handled
in the construction of the reference population and to select age categories consistent with those used for the
reference population.

Introduction
Children and adolescents may be de®ned as over-
weight using any one of a variety of reference
percentiles based on body mass index in various
populations. Some of the available references and
some issues surrounding their use have been discussed
elsewhere.1,2 The revised version of the US growth
charts includes values for body mass index (BMI)
percentiles tabulated by single month of age.3 Other
references may show BMI percentile values tabulated
by single years of age or by other age groupings.4 ± 7
It is not always clear what is the correct procedure
to follow when the ages of children in a study sample
fall between the tabulated ages for the reference
values. Ages of children in the study sample could
be rounded to the tabulated ages, so that, for example,
if the tabulated ages are in single years, the ages of
8 y, 6 months through the age of 9 y, 5 months could
be rounded to age 9 y. Alternatively ages of children
in the study sample could be truncated (eg age at last
birthday) to the tabulated ages, so that ages of 9 y,
0 months through the age of 9 y, 11 months would be
truncated to age 9 y. Another possibility is that the
reference values could be interpolated between the
tabulated ages to provide reference values for ages
other than those tabulated. Another set of issues may
arise from how data on the ages of the study sample
were collected. If data for the study sample were only
collected on age at last birthday, but the reference
shows age to the nearest month, it is again not clear
how age should be handled relative to the reference.
The objective of this paper is to explore the effects
on overweight prevalence of different methods of
categorizing age. Month-speci®c BMI cut-off values
from the revised CDC-US growth charts are applied to
several US national data sets with ages categorized
in a variety of ways.

(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). A nationally representative
sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized popu-
lation was selected using a complex, strati®ed, multi-
stage probability cluster sampling design. A home
interview was followed by a physical examination in
a mobile examination center. A description of the plan
and operation of the survey has been published.8
NHANES III is the most recent in a series of cross-
sectional health examination surveys carried out by
NCHS. For children and adolescents ages 6 ± 17 y,
data on age and BMI were also used from two earlier
surveys in the series, Cycles II and III of the National
Health Examination Survey (NHES II, 1963 ± 1965;
NHES III, 1966 ± 1970). Descriptions of these surveys
have also been published.9,10 NHES II included chil-
dren aged 6 ± 11 y and NHES III included adolescents
ages 12 ± 17 y.
The study population included all children and
adolescents aged 6 ± 17 y from NHES II, NHES III
and NHANES III. In all surveys, weight and height
were measured using standardized techniques and
equipment.11 Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). For
all surveys, sample weights were used that took into
account the sample design and the probabilities of
selection.
Age categorization
The CDC growth charts for the United States, which
are a revised version of the 1977 NCHS growth charts,
include values for body mass index (BMI) percentiles
and other anthropometric data.3 These values were
based on data from the series of US health examina-
tion surveys. However, NHANES III children were
not included in the reference population for BMI for
ages 6 y and above because of the increasing trends in
overweight for children in that survey.12
For all surveys, ages were available as age in
months at the time of examination, with age in
months truncated to the last full month (so that a
child age 73 months, 2 weeks would be considered
to be 73 months old). The revised CDC-US growth
charts provide reference percentiles for single months
of age, expressed as the midpoint of the month (for
example reference values for children from 73.0 ±
73.9 months would be given by the age 73.5 months).
Age groupings of three different lengths were
constructed using 3, 6 or 12-month intervals. Three
methods were used to select BMI 85th and 95th
percentile reference values corresponding to these
age groupings. One approach was to select the
month-speci®c BMI 85th or 95th percentile value
corresponding to the lower end of the grouped age
category (low value); others were to select the mean
(mean value) and the median (median value) of the
month-speci®c BMI 85th or 95th percentile values
over all the months included in the grouped age
category. Because the means and medians were
almost identical, only the results using means are
shown. Examples of these groupings and the asso-
ciated low value and mean value cut-off points are
shown in Table 1 for selected ages.
For each child, overweight was de®ned as a BMI
value equal to or greater than the month-of-age- and
sex-speci®c 85th or 95th percentile values from the
US growth charts. For the purposes of this paper, this
de®nition using the month-speci®c BMI values was
considered to represent the `true' overweight status.
The prevalence of overweight determined using the
other cut-off points was compared to this prevalence.
Sensitivity for a given cut-off point was estimated
as the proportion of those classi®ed as overweight by
the month-speci®c BMI percentile values who were
also classi®ed as overweight using that cut-off point.
Speci®city for a given cut-off point was calculated as
the proportion of those classi®ed as not overweight by
the month-speci®c BMI percentile values who were
also classi®ed as not overweight using that cut-off
point.
Results
The difference between the single-month-of-age
values and the mean or low cut-off points was

calculated for each month of age and averaged over
all months of age by sex for each survey for both the
85th and the 95th percentiles. The mean difference
and the standard deviation of the difference are shown
in Table 2. When the low value was used for the cut-
off point, the average differences were greater than
zero and increased with the width of the age cate-
gories. As expected, there was no difference on
average between the mean values within any category
and the month-speci®c values. The standard devia-
tions of the differences increased with increasing
category length and varied little otherwise.
Effects on the estimated prevalence of overweight
The prevalence of overweight according to the 85th
percentile is shown in Table 3 by age, sex, survey,
method of selecting a cut-off point (low value or mean
value) and category length (3, 6 or 12 months). The
differences, also shown in the table, are calculated as
the estimated prevalence of overweight for the given
subgroup minus the prevalence calculated using the
single-month-of-age groupings. Thus, for example, for
boys 6 ± 11 y old in NHES IIaIII, the prevalence of
overweight calculated using the original month-
speci®c BMI percentile values was 12.4%. When
ages were grouped into 3 month intervals and the
low value was selected as the cut-off point, the
prevalence was 0.2% higher, or 12.6%.
When the low value was selected as the cut-off
point, all differences were positive, showing that the
prevalence of overweight was overestimated for all
sex, age and survey subgroups. This overestimation
was slight for the 3 month age groupings, always less
than 1 percentage point, and somewhat higher for the
6 month age groupings, sometimes greater than 1
percentage point. The largest differences were seen
when 12 month age groupings were used with the low
value as a cut-off point. In all sex ± age ± survey
subgroups, the prevalence of overweight (85th per-
centile) was overestimated with the low value cut-off
point by 1 percentage point or more, and sometimes
by as much as 2 or even 3 percentage points.
When the mean value was selected as the cut-off
point, there was no systematic tendency for the pre-
valence of overweight to be either overestimated or
underestimated. Differences were slight in all sex ±
age ± survey subgroups, everywhere less than 1 per-
centage point and almost everywhere less than 0.5
percentage points.
Similar analyses for the 95th percentile are shown
in Table 4. The general results were similar to those
seen for the 85th percentile. Choosing the low value
as the cut-off point always resulted in an overestimate

of the prevalence, with differences being most marked
for the widest interval of 12 months. The absolute
differences were not as large as those seen for the 85th
percentile values. When the mean value within the age
category was selected as the cut-off point, there was
no systematic tendency for either overestimation or
underestimation and the average differences were
slight.
Sensitivity and speci®city
Even though prevalence estimates agree, different
methods might classify individuals differently. The
sensitivity and speci®city for each age grouping
relative to the month-speci®c BMI percentile values,
were calculated. As expected, for the low value cut-
off points, the sensitivity was always 100%, indicating
that all children who were identi®ed as overweight
relative to the month-speci®c 85th or 95th percentile
BMI value were also identi®ed as overweight by the
low value cut-off points for all age groupings. The
speci®cities for the low value cut-off point ranged
from 95.7% to 99.9% for the 85th percentile and from
97.6% to 99.9% for the 95th percentile and were
lower for the 12 month groupings than for the other
groupings.
For the mean value cut-off points, the sensitivity
ranged from 95.6% to 100% for the 85th percentile
and from 91.8% to 100% for the 95th percentile. The
speci®city ranged from 98.7% to 100% for the 85th
percentile and from 99.0% to 100% for the 95th
percentile. The sensitivities or speci®cities were
generally lower for the 12 month age groupings.
Effect on prevalence within narrower age subcategories
The effect on 6 month subgroupings of using cut-off
points from the 12 month grouping were examined,
with results shown in Table 5. When the low value
within the 12 month period was chosen as the cut-off
point, prevalences were always overestimated, but the
overestimation was much larger for the second 6
months than for the ®rst 6 months. For the second 6
months, the overestimation was greater than 3 percen-
tage points. The low value cut-off point was perfectly
sensitive (100%) relative to the month-speci®c cut-off
points, but the speci®city was everywhere less than
100%, leading to an overestimate of the prevalence of

overweight. Speci®cities were lower for the second
6 months, leading to a greater overestimate in this
category than in the ®rst 6 month period. Although the
speci®cities were high, inspection of the table shows
that even a speci®city of 96%, coupled with a sensi-
tivity of 100%, was suf®cient to lead to an over-
estimation of more than 3 percentage points within the
second 6 month subgrouping.
When the mean value for the 12 month category
was chosen as the cut-off point, the overall prevalence
estimates were very close to those obtained using the
month-speci®c BMI percentile values. However, there
was a systematic difference between months 0 ± 5 and
months 6 ± 11. The prevalence was systematically
overestimated for the ®rst 6 months of the 12, and
was systematically underestimated for the second 6
months. The overestimation and underestimation were
of similar magnitude, so the net effect on the total
prevalence over the 12 month period was small. For
the ®rst 6 months of the age category, the 12 month
mean cut-off point was perfectly speci®c, but not
quite as sensitive. For the second 6 months, the cut-
off point was perfectly sensitive but not quite as
speci®c. These minor differences in sensitivity and
speci®city resulted in underestimates of prevalence
for the ®rst 6 months and overestimates of prevalence
for the second 6 months of about 1 percentage point or
greater.
Discussion
Exactly how age should be handled relative to refer-
ence values for BMI is not always obvious. These
results show that, depending on the population, the
percentile, the reference, the age categorization and
the way the cut-off point is chosen, prevalence esti-
mates may be affected very little or may vary by as
much as 2 or 3 percentage points.
The effects on prevalence noted here arise from the
slight differences between the month-of-age BMI
percentile values and the cut-off points for the broader
age groupings. If the proportion of the population
falling into this gap is small, the effects on the
prevalence will be minor. The population and the
percentile determine how many people fall between
the month-of-age BMI percentile values and the
cut-off points for the wider groupings. For heavier
populations, or at lower percentiles, when the true
prevalences are higher, it appears that the absolute
effects of misclassi®cation are likely to be greater. In
the data examined here, the largest absolute effects
were seen for the higher prevalences based on the 85th
percentiles, even though the absolute differences
between cut-off points were greater at the 95th
percentiles.
For the reference, it is crucial to understand what
age category a given value is intended to represent.
For example, does a value labeled 9 y represent a
value for children aged exactly 9 y, 0 months? Or does
it represent a value for children ages 9 y, 0 months
through and including 9 y, 11 months? Or could it
represent a value for children ages 8 y, 6 months
through 9 y, 5 months? This requires some knowledge
of how the standard was derived. For example, Must
et al, when smoothing the NHANES I data, grouped
children and adolescents into single year of age
groupings based on age at last birthday and then
smoothed those points.5 Thus in that reference, the
value labeled age 9 y represents all 9-y-olds in the
NHANES I sample, ranging from age 9 y 0 months up
to, but not including, children aged 10 y 0 months.
Because the average age of children within year-of-
age groupings is likely to represent approximately the
midpoint of the range, these values may be considered
to represent approximately the value for a child aged
9.5 y. Given this, an appropriate procedure when using
this reference, is to group children by year of age
based on age at last birthday (eg from 9 y 0 months to
9 y 11 months) and to evaluate all children in that
group using the reference value labeled age 9 y.
Other references may have been created using a
different approach. For example, for the revised CDC-
US growth charts, reference percentiles were created
by smoothing values for single completed months of
age. Because each point represents a value for the
whole month, the values are labeled with the midpoint
of the month. Thus the value for children ages 9 y 0
months up through 9 y 0.9 months is represented as
the value for 108.5 months, equivalent to age 9 y 0.5
months. If the only data on age available for the study
sample were age at last birthday, then the most
appropriate cut-off point to use relative to this refer-
ence would probably be the average or the midpoint of
the reference values over the age range of 9 y 0.5
months to 9 y 11.5 months.
Age may be handled in other ways. One possibility
is that a reference might include point values calcu-
lated for, say, 9.0, 9.5 and 10.0 y but not list inter-
mediate values, as for example was done by Cole and
associates.7 Here, ages could be rounded to the nearest
half-year or truncated to the nearest whole year. The
value for age 9.0 could be considered as the approx-
imate midpoint for the range 8.75 ± 9.25 y and used as
a reference value for that age range. Alternatively, the
value for age 9.5 could be considered as the approx-
imate midpoint for the range 9.0 ± 9.9 y and used as a
reference value for children 9 y of age at last birthday.
Another possibility is that a reference includes values
for 9.0 and 10.0 y that represent data centered around
those values (eg 8.5 ± 9.5 y). Here also, rounding data
to the nearest year would be most appropriate, rather
than using age at last birthday (truncating). In all
these cases, to know how age should be handled
requires some understanding of how the reference
was constructed.
This information may not always be readily avail-
able. When these references are reproduced, the
information about how ages were used in the

included. For instance, the original article by Must
et al describes how the age intervals were con-
structed.5 However, when these values were reprinted
in the monograph by the WHO Expert Committee,
this information on how the age intervals were con-
structed was not included.4 Thus it could, for example,
be thought that the tabulated values for 9 and 10 y
were point estimates for the ages 9.0 and 10.0 y and
that an approximate reference value for 9.5 y could be
generated by interpolation. Actually, since the value
labeled 9 y represents approximately 9.5 y and the
value labeled 10 y represents approximately 10.5 y,
an interpolated value half-way between the two would
represent approximately 10.0 y.
These results also suggest that caution should be
exercised when trying to make prevalence estimates
within ®ner age categories than those used by the
original reference. When children were grouped into
12 month age categories and the mean values within
the category were used as the cut-off points, the
overall prevalence estimate for a given 12 month
category was quite similar to that when the single
month-of-age cut-off points were used. However,
there was a systematic bias such that the prevalence
of overweight for children in the ®rst 6 months of
the range was overestimated and the prevalence for
children in the second 6 months of the range was
underestimated, with these errors approximately com-
pensating for each other. These results suggest that if
standards are based on 12 month-of-age groupings,
then data should not be analyzed or presented by 6
month-of-age categories, and, more generally, that
data should not be analyzed or presented by narrower
age categories than the age categories used for refer-
ence values. If narrower age categories are desired,
then an appropriate procedure might be to interpolate
from the tabulated reference values to intermediate
ages. As a corollary, there appears to be no advantage
to grouping data in broader age categories than those
used by the reference either. Thus, using the narrowest
age categories that are consistent with the reference is
preferable.
Summary and conclusions
Although age categorization may often have little
effect on prevalence estimates, there are circum-
stances in which prevalence may be overestimated
by as much as 3 percentage points. Age categoriza-
tions narrower than those used to construct the
reference values may be affected by systematic
biases unless the reference values are interpolated
to match the narrower age categories. It is important
to understand how age was handled in the construc-
tion of the reference population and to select age
categories that are consistent with the reference
values being used.
