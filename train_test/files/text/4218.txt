Introduction
The term qualitative research covers a diverse, even disor-
derly, array of approaches--a "carnivalesque profusion of
methods, perspectives, and theoretical justifications"
(Atkinson et al., 2001, p. 2). This panoply of approaches can
appear foreign, challenging, and impenetrable, especially to
inexperienced qualitative researchers. As a category label,
qualitative research lends some stability to this quasi-chaotic
situation. However, differences between the approaches can
still make qualitative research amorphous. Qualitative
researchers tend therefore to struggle to typify its attributes
without resorting to oversimplifications. Some authors (e.g.,
Sale, Lohfeld, & Brazil, 2002) do not acknowledge this
problem. Others such as Punch (2005) argue for starting with
simplified definitions of qualitative research, including state-
ments, in introductory research textbooks, about what quali-
tative research is not. For example, Punch (2005) states that
"qualitative research is empirical research where the data are
not in the form of numbers" (p. 3) and other authors suggest
that qualitative research is "a not so-descriptive adjective"
(Schwandt, 2001) of research that "produces findings not
arrived at by statistical procedures or other means of quanti-
fication" (Strauss & Corbin, 1998; pp. 10-11). In contrast,
there are textbooks that speak to the variety of approaches
and traditions on which qualitative research draws in
disciplines such as health care (Grbich, 1999). Alternatively,
authors may typify this research loosely--for example, as
natural, inductive, and people-centered (e.g., Bogdan &
Biklen, 2007)--which further risks distorting its inherent
complexity. The result can be to confuse novice qualitative
researchers or generate broadly held misunderstandings.
Critics may rejoin that this stereotyping of textbook accounts
of qualitative research exacerbates continuing misunder-
standing and mistrust of qualitative research. However, I
believe that it highlights an unmet need to typify this research
in nuanced ways, a need exposing confusion over the mean-
ing of "typical."
To answer this confusion, I wish to draw on ideas of the
German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953) and sug-
gest that qualitative research has no essential nature--no
clear set of one or more predefining attributes that individu-
ally must always be present. Instead, qualitative research
derives meaning from its use to convey attributes whose

How Can a Family Resemblances
Approach Help to Typify Qualitative
Research? Exploring the Complexity of
Simplicity
Stephen Buetow1
Abstract
The term qualitative research still gives meaning to a diverse array of approaches. Attributes typical of these approaches are
easily oversimplified. Recognition that qualitative research requires no essential set of predefining attributes can minimize this
problem. This article suggests how to typify qualitative research outputs on the basis of overlapping similarities in the uses of
this research. It discusses these similarities within and across five domains of qualitative research--philosophy and theory,
purpose, approach to reasoning, data collection, and use of numbers. Across these domains, qualitative research is typified
as research that, without taking a unified stance on epistemological issues, can produce rich data by selecting and engaging
purposefully with small samples, and analyzing these data using iterative processes of induction, abduction, and deduction.
Within this network of family resemblances, no attributes of qualitative research are individually necessary or sufficient.
Together, they attend simply to the complexity of coinciding attributes of this research.

relatedness to each other--and to past research that has been
called qualitative--brings them together (as in the intersec-
tion of a Venn diagram). As Wittgenstein (1953) explains,
"The [meaning and] strength of the thread [signifying here
the categorization of qualitative research] does not reside in
the fact that some one fiber runs through its whole length, but
in the overlapping of many fibers" (p. 32a). No feature,
therefore, needs to be common to all qualitative research.
Instead, we require only a "network of similarities overlap-
ping and criss-crossing" (Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 66).
"Typical" fibers are those that suffice for the fabric of quali-
tative research to hold. Rosch's (1981) prototype theory fur-
ther recognizes that some fibers or family resemblances may
be better than others at serving this function.
This article draws on these ideas to typify qualitative
research on the basis of overlapping attributes in five related
domains: philosophy and theory, purpose, approach to rea-
soning, data collection, and use of numbers. In each domain,
an italicized typification of qualitative research highlights
prototypical features for the sake of being simple and clear
without over-sacrificing complexity (Mosenthal, 1986). This
typification dwells within a larger discussion of domain fea-
tures that are overlapping but not necessarily universal--fea-
tures that the current approach to defining qualitative
research can miss by assuming "that there are universal fea-
tures of all forms of qualitative research," not merely spe-
cific ones (Dixon-Woods, Shaw, Argarwal, & Smith, 2004,
p. 224).
Most qualitative research textbooks similarly start by
describing standard features of qualitative research within
specific methodological design options (e.g., Creswell,
2003), research perspectives (e.g., Flick, Von Kardorff, &
Steinke, 2004), or paradigmatic approaches (e.g., Lincoln &
Guba, 1985). In contrast, a family resemblances approach
can typify qualitative research by producing a single clear
image of sufficient overlapping features that typify this
research more comprehensively than does the requirement
for all features to be present within the individual domains.
Family resemblances still privilege common features--and
therefore a post-positivist conceptualization of qualitative
research--and can overlook differences that question salient
patterns and facilitate theory building. However, reference to
prototypes gives weight to the importance of features of the
typification. And, like a wide-brim umbrella, the typification
gives shelter to diverse features, can be constantly checked,
and can oversee an evolving pedagogy and curriculum for
teaching qualitative research.
Philosophy and Theory
Some researchers mix qualitative (and quantitative) methods
to address their research question (Creswell, 2003)--which
may seek to solve a problem in the real world or widen
insights into, and understanding of, a complex issue--and
increase confidence in their research findings (O'Cathain,
Murphy, & Nicholl, 2007; Patton, 2002). I respect this
approach to bridging differences that can be important in
practice, but want to suggest that philosophical differences,
even between quantitative research and qualitative research,
are frequently overstated in degree and importance.
Overlapping the different types of qualitative research (and
quantitative research) are important similarities in philoso-
phy and theory, which too often go unrecognized.
I contend that the different types of qualitative research
are similar and their underlying philosophical differences
tend to be unimportant or exaggerated. Qualitative research
draws on highly abstract, global, and non-testable theories
called meta-theories, such as post-positivism, social con-
structionism, and pragmatism, which are much more similar
to each other than is typically acknowledged. Post-positivist
researchers believe in the existence of an objective, material
reality beyond the mind and language. However, as Burr
(2003) admits, so too do most of the relativists among the
pragmatists and social constructionists, just as "most realists
acknowledge the power of language to construct the world in
some respects" (p. 88). The differences between these groups
can be subtle. A key difference between their respective
approaches is that social constructionists and pragmatists,
unlike post-positivists, tend to avoid or at least de-emphasize
the question of reality per se.
Pragmatists replace the distinction between appearance
and reality with one between more and less useful descrip-
tions. The value of these descriptions derives from their use-
fulness not as mirrors but as tools for producing things that
people want. For pragmatists such as Putnam ), the tools are
(usefully) answerable to an objective reality, whereas other
pragmatists, such as Rorty, reduce reality to agreement
within a community (Horner, 2004; Rorty et al., 2004). They
resemble social constructionists, who, doubting that the real-
ity of an external world can be directly known, do not con-
cern themselves with its nature. Instead, they seek consensus
on what can be apprehended through discourse--as lan-
guage-in-use--in a given, historical and cultural context. In
common with the pragmatists, they acknowledge that "lan-
guage can be used to refer to reality for practical purposes"
(Burr, 2003, p. 93). For example, most social constructionists
accept that high blood pressure exists, but point out that once
we discuss it, it becomes the social construct of hyperten-
sion, which is useful as well as real on the basis of the con-
text-bound, arbitrary thresholds delimiting hypertension
from normotensive blood pressure. Post-positivists agree
that the world is open to interpretation, that incomplete
understanding of this world varies between people, and that
language contributes to this variation. Yet, for them, knowl-
edge of the world and its positive use depend less on how
discourse constructs the world than on how reality is tenta-
tively understood. They reject any pragmatist premise that
truth necessarily depends on "what works."
The notion that qualitative research is more value-laden
and subjective than "objective" quantitative research is
Buetow 3
similarly too simple. Values permeate both types of research
at all stages, including the assumptions made, questions
posed, methods used, what the research expects to find, and
how findings are recognized and then interpreted for mean-
ing, explanation, publication, and other use. All qualitative
research and quantitative research therefore incorporate sub-
jective acts. Qualitative researchers, however, most openly
acknowledge this fact; distrust claims that objectivity makes
them passive recipients of external information; and reflect
on how their values influence their research and its objectiv-
ity. However, this self-awareness and self-reflection, among
other things, can enhance their objective comprehension of,
and ability to manage, the influence of their own subjective
experience (Ratner, 2002). For all these reasons, I de-empha-
size philosophical differences between types of qualitative
research (and even between quantitative research and quali-
tative research).
Purpose
From recognizing all research as value-laden, and de-stabi-
lizing the opposition in qualitative research between what is
socially constructed and what is real, I now wish to suggest
that qualitative research seeks most importantly to generate
rich data, typically from small samples. This research tends
to be exploratory, although it can also test, seek to confirm,
and generate ideas. Reasons for qualitative research seeking
to produce rich data include, but do not depend on, a search
for in-depth understanding of lived experiences and beliefs,
ideally in a natural setting (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). However,
most qualitative research is not naturalistic--the formal
qualitative interview, the most common method of qualita-
tive data collecting, produces non-naturally occurring talk
(Murphy & Dingwall, 2003)--and understanding is not
always the key purpose of qualitative research. Just as impor-
tant may be instrumental, emancipatory, and symbolic uses
of findings (Rossman & Rallis, 2012).
All these uses depend on qualitative data whose richness
derives from their contextual depth, is feasible to achieve in
small samples, and speaks to the value of generalizations
beyond specific settings (Payne & Williams, 2005). Given
the smallness and selected nature of these samples, some
social constructionists minimize or deny the need to general-
ize from one set of circumstances in qualitative research to
another (Payne & Williams, 2005). Indeed, a challenge has
been mounted to "the possibility of generalizability in any
type of research, be it qualitative or quantitative . . . because
findings are always embedded within a context" (Polit &
Beck, 2010, p. 1452). Other scholars have suggested that
generalization is overrated as a source of scientific progress
(Flyvbjerg, 2006). However, increasing demand for general-
izable and useful knowledge comes from qualitative
researchers who view the generalization of qualitative
research as both possible and important. From the perspec-
tive that "generalization is a matter of degree, rather than a
binary decision" (Kennedy, 1979, p. 665), they believe that
knowledge can be generalized from one or a small number of
cases, to all instances similar to those studied (Ayres,
Kavanagh, & Knafl, 2013). A family resemblances approach
accommodates the capability of qualitative research to have
a purpose of generating data that may be generalizable.
Three modes of generalization elaborate on this purpose
(Lewis & Ritchie, 2003). First, "representational generaliza-
tion" addresses in qualitative research the question of
whether sample findings can represent the phenomenon of
interest and on that basis be generalized to a target popula-
tion. The second mode is the "theoretical generalization" of
general principles and conditions that make different experi-
ences possible. It can include a need to revise or reject a
proposition when even one observation does not fit the
developing schema. The third mode is "inferential general-
ization" of sets of patterns; sometimes also referred to as
naturalistic generalization (Stake, 1995), transferability
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985), case-to-case translation (Firestone,
1993), or reader generalizability (Misco, 2007). It aims to
enable readers to have the detailed descriptions they need to
assess whether empirical findings can be generalized beyond
the sample setting. In summary, unifying the different types
of qualitative research is the aim of constructing rich data,
typically from small samples, which often can be generalized
in different ways.
Approach to Reasoning
The source of all three of the modes of generalization from
qualitative research is analysis rather than probability, and
logical inference rather than statistical inference (Mitchell,
1983). Purposefully selected qualitative samples are appro-
priately typified as not amenable to generalization on a sta-
tistical basis, yet even quantitative research seldom meets the
assumptions of the statistical inference procedures it never-
theless over-applies; many quantitative studies start from the
sample rather than the population and do not sample ran-
domly or achieve random or representative samples (Polit &
Beck, 2010). Logical inference for generalization entails a
form of induction. However, inductive reasoning can also
contribute to analogy and concept formation outside the
domain of generalization (Tsang & Williams, 2013).
Widely typified as being mainly inductive, qualitative
research includes bottom-up reasoning from specific obser-
vations to identify patterns and generate concepts, hypothe-
ses, and theory. This typification is clearest when approaches
to qualitative data analysis (QDA) are explicitly labeled as
inductive, for example, by Thomas (2006). However,
although mainly inductive, the practice of qualitative
research typically demonstrates a recursive cycle of analogi-
cal, inductive, and deductive reasoning (Bendassolli, 2013).
This cycle lessens differences between qualitative research
and quantitative research, the latter being typically misrepre-
sented as merely deductive.
4 SAGE Open
Analogical reasoning involves the logic of comparison
and contrast. For example, inferential generalization requires
researchers to generate thick descriptions of local particulars
to give readers of their research sufficient information to
compare the similarity of their own case setting against the
setting described by the research. This comparison involves
readers in reasoning whether, on balance, these situations are
alike enough on a large number of relevant attributes to war-
rant an empirical, intuitive type of inferential generalization.
Theoretical generalization may similarly invoke analogical
reasoning, but here the researcher explicates a theory, which
is likely supported by analogy (Rossman & Yore, 2009).
Analogical reasoning may draw on inductive reasoning or
generate arguments that are deductively valid.
Deductive reasoning--from a pre-existing framework
that entails its conclusions--is actually common in qualita-
tive research. It is evident in several ways. Pre-existing
research and orienting concepts or theory are likely to sensi-
tize the researcher to a problem requiring investigation. It
can also give focus to the study objectives. Qualitative
research seldom realizes Scriven's (1991) "goal free" ideal
of evaluating only actual effects against demonstrated needs
(p. 56). Indeed, the so-called framework approach to QDA
was developed for policy-relevant research in which the
study objectives are structured explicitly and transparently in
advance to satisfy funding requirements (Ritchie & Spencer,
1993).
Conspicuously here, but also in qualitative research in
general, the study objectives stated and any existing frame-
work will guide the collection and analysis of data, a priori
by informing the identification of relevant study domains
and incipient coding categories (MacFarlane & O'Reilly-de
Brún, 2012). Although typically noted to generate rather than
test prior hypotheses (Thomas, 2006), most qualitative
research is iterative, non-linear and seeks deductively to
refine and confirm the early ideas and patterns that it identi-
fies (inductively) from the study data. Because induction can
lead to false conclusions, these processes include looking for
disconfirming (or deviant) cases that do not fit the patterns
that the researcher finds. Disconfirming cases that are found
are drawn upon analogically to hone meanings of the pat-
terns and themes in the context of rival explanations. Themes
and new theoretical ideas are also checked against pre-exist-
ing knowledge (Rudnick, 2014). Less generally, deductive
reasoning is apparent in qualitative approaches such as Yin's
(1994) case study method and pattern-matching (Hyde,
2000). These approaches state theoretical propositions before
data gathering commences or, in the case of analytic induc-
tion, from the first case or early cases. They then test the
propositions, their premises, or both. This testing involves
deducing expected consequences and comparing them with
what the data show. When the data describe one observed
case, a general rule may be reasoned to best account for that
case. This (abductive) reasoning from a single case is a spe-
cial form of induction. Meanwhile, other approaches, such as
replication case study designs and "hold-out" samples, fur-
ther formalize the use of deductive testing procedures. Hold-
out samples denote data archived to test propositions
developed through early data analysis (Hyde, 2000).
Deduction is even evident in highly inductive approaches
such as classic grounded theory, where "deduction and veri-
fication are the servants of emergence" (Heath & Crowley,
2004, p. 144). Despite recognizing that this theory overplays
its inductive elements, Strauss and Corbin perpetuate the
myth in their own version of grounded theory--QDA--that
theory can "emerge from the data" (Strauss & Corbin, 1998,
p. 12). Seldom can researchers initially and temporarily put
aside their prior knowledge, beliefs, and full range of every-
day, conscious experience; keep an open mind; and let data
speak for themselves. Indeed, QDA emphasizes deductive
reasoning by using predetermined categories (such as condi-
tions, context, and consequences) to cluster open codes (that
can be integrated with a core category to produce a theory).
Over time, however, QDA has become more inductive by
requiring ongoing data comparisons to facilitate the develop-
ment of theory.
Data Collection
Having suggested why qualitative research is mainly induc-
tive but also tends to involve analogical and deductive rea-
soning, I now want to consider the collection of data around
which such reasoning takes place. There is a tendency to
typify qualitative data collection as involving naturalistic
observation and semi-structured or unstructured interviews
that pose open questions as part of a dialogue. This dialogue
is more than "a tool of inquiry . . . [and signifies] a wholly
engaged encounter" that aims to be caring, democratic,
and--by giving voice to interviewees--emancipatory (Kuntz
& Presnall, 2012, p. 733). Students are generally further
taught to avoid "problematic" interviewing practices such as
asking closed--and, in particular, leading--questions (Ezzy,
2010).
However, these generalizations oversimplify qualitative
interviewing. Qualitative interviews are not power-free
meetings of equals. They are hierarchical interactions that
have latent potential for manipulation and exploitation
(Kvale, 2006). Like a "Trojan horse," they can be used to
create trust, get behind interviewees' defense walls, and con-
trol the interview. In these terms, qualitative interviews are
conversations, rather than open dialogues, purposefully con-
ducted to satisfy the research interest of the interviewer in
uncovering or constructing how the interviewee understands
and makes sense of their private life world. How the inter-
view data are collected, interpreted, and reported remains
largely outside the control of the interviewee (Kvale, 2006).
Researchers should not appropriate knowledge without
giving value back to participants--for example, by asking
them questions they want to be asked and listening actively
to the answers. Nevertheless, closed questions can fit the
Buetow 5
purpose of qualitative interviews. Even though formal quali-
tative interviews are not naturalistic, the use of closed ques-
tions mirrors habitual aspects of everyday social interaction.
As detail-oriented probes, these questions can follow up, and
focus, responses from interviewees by requesting and facili-
tating further, specific information from them. The questions
can also check or clarify the understanding of the interviewer
(Roulston, 2011), require interviewees to justify their state-
ments (Brinkmann, 2007; Curato, 2012), and help to control
interviews. Such control is important when time is scarce
and interviewees dwell on material that does not answer the
question posed, are loquacious, or appear to withhold infor-
mation. Likewise, leading questions can appropriately char-
acterize interviews because "the decisive issue . . . is not
whether to lead or not to lead, but where the questions do
lead" (Kvale, 1996, p. 89)). More important therefore than
stipulating the use of open and non-leading questions is pro-
viding a framework wherein questions can lead participants
to provide answers that accurately represent their world and
point of view and are relevant to serving the research aims of
the interviewer (Patton, 2002). In other words, the quality of
formal interviews depends less on the types of questions
posed than their ability to achieve the purposes of the
research (Kvale, 1996).
Use of Numbers
Compared with quantitative research, qualitative research
continues to be typified as de-emphasizing the use of num-
bers (Adler & Adler, 2012). Numbers are not, of course, a
key characteristic overlapping other features of qualitative
research. However, a family resemblances approach allows
recognition of their relevance to different stages of, and
approaches to, conducting qualitative research. Numbers can
be used to establish the rationale for qualitative research, be
important to consider and describe in sampling for qualita-
tive research, and characterize some forms of QDA.
Small samples typify, but are not unique to, qualitative
research; they can also characterize quantitative research,
most notably single-subject trials of treatment safety and
effectiveness. Moreover, the size of qualitative samples var-
ies. Diversity within the study group is likely to increase the
sample size needed. Qualitative samples that are too small
for the purpose of a particular study can miss a key perspec-
tive. Overlarge qualitative samples introduce redundancy
and thus contribute inefficiently to the developing under-
standing of the researcher.
In turn, researchers may seek to analyze the content of
qualitative data by enumerating in context the frequency of
keywords or ideas within analyzed text. The generated fre-
quencies may be reported as numbers explicitly or implicitly
through verbal language such as "most" or "usually." This
approach can represent "an attempt not to infer meaning but,
rather, to explore usage" (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005, p. 1283)
and it can appropriately facilitate and display pattern
recognition.
However, as a point of difference from quantitative
research, the use of simple counts in non-probability samples
cannot give precision to statements about "the frequency,
typicality or even intensity of an event" (Sandelowksi, 2001,
p. 231). Counts of how many participants report something
are also difficult to interpret or use to validate a viewpoint in
these samples. Participants' stories "defy the anonymity of a
number" (Seidman, 2006, p. 9) because "it is the quality of
the insight that is important, rather than the number of
respondents that share it" (Wainwright, 1997, p. 11). Bradley,
Curry, and Devers (2007) nevertheless exemplify the misno-
mer that "themes are recurrent unifying concepts or state-
ments about the subject of inquiry" (p. 1760) even though
recurrence cannot suffice to identify themes because it is not
the same as importance (Buetow, 2010). Because codes can
be infrequent but important, and because inductive reasoning
does not confer likelihood or probability (Rudnick, 2014),
the number of instances is also irrelevant to the ability to
generalize findings on the basis of logic. My key point, how-
ever, is that the relevance of numbers to qualitative research
can be easily overlooked in the absence of looking for family
resemblances.
Conclusion
This discussion has sought to offer a more nuanced under-
standing of qualitative research. It has used a family resem-
blances approach to typify qualitative research as a unified
collection of overlapping similarities, none of which is indi-
vidually necessary or sufficient. This approach typifies qual-
itative research more comprehensively than does requiring
predefining features. My approach also helps to circumvent
the current plethora of competing definitions of, and
approaches to, qualitative research. Instead, it yields a single
clear image of qualitative research as producing rich data by
selecting and engaging purposefully with small samples, and
analyzing them using iterative processes of abduction, induc-
tion, and deduction--without taking an overtly unified
stance on epistemological issues. These family resemblances
reflect a loose kind of structure that still reduces the com-
plexity of qualitative research to similarities and common
features, a characteristic typical of post-positivist epistemol-
ogy and methodology. However, the focus now is on what
some features--not necessarily all--have in common. The
use of prototypes minimizes this limitation by qualitatively
highlighting features that appear functionally most impor-
tant.Afurther problem is that for observable features of qual-
itative research to resemble one another (and so share a
family resemblance) is different from them forming a natural
family; thus, there is likely to be a "gray zone" in which
some examples of qualitative research--such as applications
of a summative content analysis--do not look like qualita-
tive research, whereas other non-qualitative research--such
as a case report--looks qualitative. However, family resem-
blances usefully approximate truth in terms of coherence
within a system of consistent propositions. I invite readers
6 SAGE Open
therefore to consider developing this approach, and my
application of it, to attend as simply as possible to the com-
plex challenge of defining qualitative research.
