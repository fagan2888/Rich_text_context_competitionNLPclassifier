Introduction
The educational system in Finland is considered to be one of
the best in the world. If this is to be believed, how did Finland
achieve such success, while having been oppressed by neigh-
boring nations during political conflicts in the 1930s and late
1940s? The quest to achieve this success lay solely in the
hands of the educational leadership of the nation. Although
educational leadership can have an immense impact on the
educational system of the country, school leadership can
simultaneously make an equivalent contribution to growth
from within the system. Effective school leadership leads to
school success, which, in turn, can help a nation's citizens to
thrive. Accordingly, to improve the educational system, only
qualified teachers should be allowed to teach. Similarly, in
Finland, to be a qualified teacher, a master's degree is man-
datory, while schooling starts at the age of 7 for Grade 1
(Sahlberg, 2010).
The Finnish education system is well known through the
excellent performance of its students in the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA). However, the stan-
dard of this performance has recently fallen (Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2016).
In Finland, free education offers equality to all and shows
concern for all students, including special students (disabled
students) from primary education through to higher educa-
tion. In line with this principle of equality, Finnish legislation
has initiated a series of special-education laws to protect the
well-being of the special student. This legislature provides for
three models. These are general support, intensive support,
and special support (Pesonen et al., 2015). This enables
school leaders to support a quality education system in
schools by offering adequate facilities with a focus on special

Leadership Actions-Oriented Behavioral
Style to Accommodate Change and
Development in Schools
Mani Man Singh Rajbhandari1
Abstract
This study explores the leadership actions-oriented behavior of school principals in Finland. Actions-orientated behavior
enables the leader to appropriately articulate relations and task orientation to meet the immediate contextual demands and
to accommodate followership toward change and development. The leadership actions-orientated behavior of Finnish school
principals were studied in three schools. In-depth interviews with school actors (principals, vice principals, teachers, special
educators, and nonteaching staff) were conducted to triangulate the analyzed data. It was found that leadership actions-oriented
behavior enabled school leaders to articulate appropriate behavioral patterns to generate motivation and commitment. The
results suggest that actions orientations toward high-on relations enabled leaders to achieve leadership success, while actions
orientations toward high-on task enabled leadership effectiveness. Actions-oriented behavior toward high-on task enables
leadership flexibility with greater leadership elasticity. The results suggest that school actors anticipated a relational approach,
whose actions orientations were high-on task. The results also suggest that relations-oriented behavior is rationally applied by
school leaders who have remained in the organization for a longer time to strengthen the systematic approach. It was found
that leaders' actions orientation with high-on task were more effective, while leadership actions orientation with high-on
relations generated social harmony. The results suggest that leadership actions-oriented behavioral flexibility and mobility can
be maintained by articulating high relations to low relations and high task to low task, not necessarily from task to relations or
relations to task alone. In doing so, a leader's personality is prevented from distortions and behavior dysfunction.

needs and care (Rajbhandari, 2016a). Furthermore, this offers
opportunities for special students to enroll in schools that are
conveniently located. The model for special education differs
from that of general education, and offers equality and justice
for all. Consequently, it became mandatory for the special-
student law to be applied in all schools in Finland, which
posed certain logistical and financial challenges. Emanating
from these challenges were new problems with the manage-
ment in school and its leadership due to the emergence of new
contextual variations in the school environment.
To achieve progress toward change, the school leader is
equally challenged to "grow" the periphery of qualified
teachers, especially to direct and instruct the teachers
toward the betterment of students and school development.
Therefore, school leaders as change agents face challeng-
ing moments in leadership, where contextual intelligence
and contextual experience, which were initially explained
as practical intelligence (Sternberg, 1985), can generate
actions-oriented behavior according to the requirements of
the contextual variants. This requires of leadership to
understand, adapt, and initiate behavior according to the
requirements of the situation among the followers, and
within the followership domain. This actions-oriented
behavior is the leader's primary means of incorporating the
appropriate blend of relations- and task-orientated behav-
ior guided by the leader's Skills, Abilities, Competences
and Intelligence (SACI) to best suit the primary situational
context. Moreover, within the school setting, classes are
steered by more than one teacher, thus necessitating team-
work, which has to be planned and organized by the school
leader. As organizing and planning can consume most of
the leader's time and energy, the appropriate blend of rela-
tions and task orientation, whether high or low on any of
these behavioral orientations, can be achieved by school
leaders through their actions-oriented behavior. Actions-
oriented behavior provides a means of restoring leadership
equilibrium by mediating the gaps between internal and
external variables.
Despite the fact that variations within and between con-
texts is inevitable, school leaders have to respond appropri-
ately to prevent situational catastrophe. In responding,
school leaders are able to apply various patterns of behav-
ioral styles to coordinate school actors (such as teachers,
administrative staff, and students) by instituting collabora-
tion for organizational change. This further enables school
leaders to implement suitable behavioral leadership pat-
terns to motivate school actors to adopt immediate organi-
zational changes. Consequently, this study explored the
leadership readiness behavioral pattern in three schools that
had different environmental cultures, climates, school
sizes, and capacities in Finland.
In this study, leadership behavior was explored as a case
study to identify the appropriate leadership behavior of each
school leader. This study was conducted by constructing a
theoretical framework incorporating behavioral leadership
theory which originated at Ohio State University and the
University of Michigan. The leadership philosophical para-
digm is vague. Moreover, leadership success and effective-
ness is appraised by the leader's ability in time management,
task accomplishment with individuals and groups within sit-
uational context. This is in connection with philosophy of
transformational leadership (Bass, 1985; Burns, 1978;
Serviovanni, 1990; Sun, Chen, & Zhang, 2017) which is
based on the concepts of building, bonding, and banking.
With regard to the philosophical paradigm of leadership
behavioral patterns, school leadership readiness--to attain
competence, prudency, and pragmatic endurance--can be
attained by team building with task orientation, team bond-
ing with relational orientation, and banking both the behav-
ioral actions orientations with intelligence. To endure the
internal affairs of the academic realm, school leadership has
to attempt to curtail pitfalls by communicating effectively,
and becoming confident in attaining the common goal by
winning trust for employee productivity.
Leadership effectiveness and success depends largely on
the leader's behavioral patterns. Using behavioral leadership
theory, studies conducted at Ohio State University in the year
1945 and University of Michigan in the year 1947 (Bass,
2008; Likert, 1967) both identified two types of leader
behavior as either "initiation" or "consideration," "people-
oriented" or "task-oriented," and "employee-centered" or
"job-centered." Later, these behaviors were named as rela-
tions-oriented and task-oriented behaviors (Northouse,
2010). Leadership behavioral patterns of collaboration, task,
and relations are, however, implemented within the contex-
tual setting, which enables the leader to use their practical
intelligence (Sternberg, 2003) to illustrate actions behavioral
orientations according to situational variations. This initiates
the leadership to illustrate effective behavior of relations and
task for building team and work achievement.
According to Yulk (2008), effective leadership behaviors
and programs are mutually compatible for creating synergies
effects rather than the side effects. School leadership success
and effectiveness significantly enhances teacher's efficiency,
and student accolade. According to the Appalachia
Educational Laboratory (2005), leaders' behavioral pattern
need to support the student performance through the com-
munication with teachers for their effectiveness. The labora-
tory modeled leadership behavioral patterns in terms of a
reciprocal-effects model. They claimed that the reciprocal
effect generates leadership behavior that connects to leader's
ability of interaction, skills to intervening variables, and stu-
dent achievement. In addition to this, Yulk (2008) suggests
that the competence of leadership enables leader's ability to
comprehend the situation and adapting to a flexible leader-
ship style for organizational effectiveness.
Therefore, in exploring leadership actions-oriented
behavior within the relations- and task-orientated behavioral
approaches used to accommodate change and development
in schools, two research questions were constructed:
Rajbhandari 3
Research Question 1: What leadership behavioral style
was implemented by school leaders to adopt changes and
development in schools?
Research Question 2: How did the actions-oriented lead-
ership behavioral style initiate school success and follow-
ership maintenance?
Method
This study made use of qualitative analysis. The study on lead-
ership actions-oriented behavior of principals in Finnish schools
was guided by behavioral leadership theory. The construction
of the theoretical framework included relations- and task-ori-
ented behavior, which are blended and articulated into the
actions-orientated behavioral style of principals in Finnish
schools. Behavioral leadership theory superseded the traits the-
ory of leadership and introduced sophisticated measures to
understand the leadership behavior of relations and task orienta-
tions. Leadership behavioral orientation was further analyzed to
explain the principals'leadership style by illustrating their lead-
ership actions-oriented behavior. This was achieved by studying
the appropriate combination of relations and task orientations.
As mentioned, behavioral leadership theory was first
explored by the Ohio State University in 1945, and later by the
University of Michigan in 1947, using a quantitative tool
developed to explain leader behavior--the Leaders Behavioral
Description Questionnaire (LBDQ; Stogdill, 1963). This anal-
ysis and the LBDQ were highly acclaimed and accepted within
leadership study. Although the LBDQ is quantitatively formu-
lated, this study used key aspects from the LBDQ to understand
the qualitative paradigm of leadership actions-oriented behav-
ior by incorporating leadership relations and task orientation.
This explorative study offered the opportunity to under-
stand leadership's actions orientation (blending relations and
task) on a deeper level, which the quantitative tool could not
achieve. Although relations and task orientation are viewed
as separate behaviors, these two leadership behaviors are not
mutually exclusive, but together strengthen the bond for
leaders to execute an actions orientation that utilizes these
behavioral patterns simultaneously.
Moreover, this study is viewed as a different case, with
each context constituting a different case. Nevertheless, the
cases are linked by certain commonalities, with school lead-
ers acting as "gap fillers" and adapting their behavioral ori-
entation according to the situations of need within the
different contexts. Furthermore, within its area of responsi-
bility and accountability, leadership competence needs to
combine relations- and task-oriented behavior to initiate
actions-orientated behavior that enables school principals to
fill the gap between internal and external variations.
Research Tools and Techniques
For the purpose of qualitatively exploring the leadership
behavioral patterns of Finnish school principals, one-on-one
in-depth interviews were conducted with school actors. All
the interviews were tape-recorded for reliability and validity
checking. Two different sets of interviews were designed.
One set of interviews was designed to analyze the interviews
with school principals, while the other set of interviews was
designed to analyze and explore the followership domain.
These two sets of interview schedules captured the voices of
school actors involved within the school setting. Furthermore,
these two sets of interview schedules enabled me to verify
and triangulate the data collected from different data sources,
which included a descriptive analysis of leader initiatives
and behavioral patterns.
Data Collection and Analysis
Procedures
The method of data collection was conducted by tape-record-
ing. Every detail was recorded to analyze qualitative mean-
ings, which further enabled me to understand the feelings of
the respondent on a deeper level. The respondents in this
study were school principals, teachers, administrative staff,
and special-student teachers. Each interview lasted for at least
1 hr, and a few interviews were longer than an hour. Interviews
were conducted in English and Finnish. For reliability and
validity checking, the tape-recorded interviews were tran-
scribed, and Finnish interviews were translated and further
interpreted to give meaning to the data. The transcribing was
completed by me, which offered me the additional benefit of
understanding each interviewee and capturing their feelings.
Although the interviewee's views were never shared with the
respondent, they were used to cross-verify the findings from
the leadership behavior descriptive analysis.
The respondent data were triangulated further to verify
the analysis of the leadership behavior descriptions of rela-
tions and task orientation toward initiating the actions orien-
tation. This technique of analysis offered validation and
reliability for additional cross verification. Data triangula-
tion analysis (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2002; Lauri,
2011) contributed significantly to validating the actions-ori-
ented behavioral style of school principals through the lens
of both relations- and task-orientated behavior. The triangu-
lation analysis also captured related views from respondents
in determining the leaders' initiating behavioral pattern
toward actions orientation. All respondent identities were
kept anonymous for ethical reasons. However, to identify the
respondents, pseudonyms were used, that is, Teachers 1, 2,
and 3; special-student teacher; vice principal; and principal.
Similarly, schools were identified as Schools A, B, and C.
Results
This section reports on the cases of three schools, and
endeavors to highlight the leadership actions-oriented behav-
ioral style by articulating both relations-oriented and task-
oriented behavior. The results are based on the analysis of the
4 SAGE Open
reflective critical views of the school actors. These collective
views were cross-verified by triangulation analysis. However,
the three cases are presented independently to address the
research questions.
Leadership Actions-Oriented Behavior: The Case
of School A
Leadership behaviors and skills are essential to use in con-
junction with trusted staff (Goff, 2003). Identifying trusted
staff requires leadership to show consideration of behavioral
patterns to motivate staff toward task accomplishment. In tak-
ing such a necessary step, appropriate articulation of relations
and task is needed to enhance leader actions orientation by
blending the two behaviors. A possible way of knowing and
understanding the staff within the school organization is to
get involved with them and build good relational behavior.
This actions orientation, which is high-on relations, empha-
sizes the need for school leaders to bring about motivation
within the followership domain. In the case of School A's
principal, her compassionate and generous characters resulted
in her becoming successful and trusted through initiating rela-
tions-orientations to accommodate the entire body of school
actors during times of change. Supporting her actions-ori-
ented behavior of using relational approaches, she stated,
As being the head of school, my prime concern is to think about
the school, and its staff. I believe in team work, working together
as a group has helped us so far. I am lenient towards my staff.
Furthermore, she added,
We work in an open environment. We share our issues and
matters together with each other for the betterment of our school.
It helps us to figure out our problem as well, where we are
lacking in our teaching method and how much we have achieved
in our goal so far.
Actions-orientated behavior toward building relations with
school actors inspires the working professional staff to col-
laborate with the principal when dramatic change takes place
in the school. Moreover, the principal's actions-oriented
behavior of closely collaborating with the vice principal to
undertake the change process, and bring about an open-door
policy of information sharing, helped to motivate the profes-
sional community. In support of this approach, the vice prin-
cipal mentions,
She believes in sharing information with her staff, even though
the decision is made by me or any other staff, she takes the
responsibility of that decision on her shoulder. The bond of trust
between principal and her staff is very strong. In one word I
would like to say, we rely and trust on each other.
This style of actions-oriented behavior describes the princi-
pal's behavioral approach toward school effectiveness. The
principal's actions-orientated strategy, used to influence her
staff, was through information sharing. This articulated behav-
ioral orientations by the school leader strengthened the build-
ing of a strong foundation of relations among and between the
leaders and followership, thus winning the trust of the follow-
ership domain. The vice principal described this by saying,
The most important thing in this school about head teacher and
other staff is, she trust all her staff. She shares all her information
with us, which makes the school environment effective and cozy
to work in. She always wants to have everything, this way she
can mention that this is the way I work, she always takes
responsibilities for the decision she makes and even though if
they comes from the staff or from me.
This actions orientation, which is high-on relations and low-
on task, empowered in-group members with crucial informa-
tion. Information sharing is a way toward building trust
among and between the school professional communities.
Information is shared within the trusted and who have the
in-group status. In school settings, trust is one of the contrib-
uting factors shaping for instrumental and forming value-
based attitude. To be trusted and trusting people are both
complicated task for school leader. Leadership confidence
and communicative power to illustrate the vision and show
direction is necessary and essential at the time of accommo-
dating change, which is accomplished together with the
trusted individuals of the in-group. To support this view of
the principal's open policy trustfulness, an administrative
staff member added,
The major thing about our principal is that she equips us with
sufficient information that we need, and I think she trust on her
staff.
Although leadership behavior is concerned with relations-
and task-orientated behavior, it is equally essential for the
school leader to apply these two behaviors reciprocally to
bring about effectiveness. The articulation of these two
behavioral styles generates an actions-orientated leadership
style that is either high or low on task and relations, depend-
ing on the situational need of the context and the followers.
Consequently, trusting and being trusted produce effective-
ness. This behavioral style led to an open socio-environs,
which reflected a good organizational climate. The rela-
tional-behavioral orientation of the school leader in this
school enabled the staff to openly share the problems they
faced. Teacher 1 stated,
She is very honest and frank, whatever is there in her mind, she
always tells us openly, whenever we discuss about any problems,
and she speaks her words openly. This is why we go to her
whenever we have our problem.
Whether articulating and to orient task and relational behav-
ior are mutually exclusive or not, articulating these behaviors
Rajbhandari 5
according to feelings, emotions, and level of trust can vary,
which can be maintained by taking the necessary actions
toward relations building. Nevertheless, nature of leadership
behavior is flexible and is determined by the contextual set-
tings and the leader's SACI. According to Yulk (2008), a
flexible leadership behavioral orientation initiates the leader
to adapt leadership style-mix based on autocratic, demo-
cratic, and abdicratic leadership (Rajbhandari, 2006, 2012).
The mixture of leadership style enables a leader to adapt
their behavioral orientation--either high or low, on either
task- or relations-oriented behavior--to achieve high pro-
ductivity. The vice principal illustrates the school principal's
actions-orientated behavioral style of articulating task and
relations by stating,
She is very helpful and she helps everyone in need, whether its
teacher or students or even a parent, she is always by our side at
times of need and this is why we rely in her. This is her strongest
point.
Articulation of the actions-oriented behavior of a leader heav-
ily relies and depends upon the contextual variations. The con-
textual variation of School A was to bring about changes in the
school to align it with international standards by improving the
school's structure, leadership capabilities, and followership
capacities. This was a radical change initiated by the national
educational department and municipality. In bringing about
this change and development, the leader's role was mainly con-
cerned with motivation and commitment of the school actors.
In directing them toward adopting the changes, the leader was
required to articulate an actions orientation that included both
relations- and task-oriented behavior. Nevertheless, many
school actors resisted the change. To harmonize the organiza-
tional climate, the school principal focused on collaboration
among the school actors by adopting an actions orientation
high-on relations-oriented behavior. This approach encouraged
the staff to develop the motivation to work. In other words, by
exhibiting an actions-oriented behavior toward relations, the
school leader was able to participate with, and support, the
school's professional community. In connection to Teacher 3,
the school principal demonstrated her supportive behavior and
concern for people and this actions orientation further contrib-
uted values to their work­life values:
If I have to name it then that would be our principal, she is very
encouraging and supportive.
Moreover, articulating an actions orientation toward relations-
oriented behavior has become a successful phenomenological
approach for many leaders. However, leadership readiness is
essential for leadership behavioral flexibility and mobility
(Rajbhandari, 2014). However, both task- and relations-orien-
tations are intertwined and inseparable. Moreover, behavioral
articulation within the followership domain also contributes a
pivotal role in shaping and articulating leadership behavior.
The leadership behavior depends largely on, and changes sig-
nificantly, according to, the actions-oriented behavioral pat-
tern of the followers and followership domain. Leadership
behavior, therefore, is closely interlinked with the follower-
ship domain and the followers' actions orientation.
The principal played an essential role in establishing a rela-
tions orientation in School A through team building and bond-
ing for collaboration, which generated the driving stimulus for
change and development. The principal's strategy of actions-
oriented behavior high-on relations was required to enrich
team building to facilitate change and remove constraints.
Teacher 3 in her statement (above) indicates the importance of
the principal's role in articulating an actions orientation toward
high-on relations and low-on task, and how this generated col-
laborations within the followership domain.
Although the principal articulated high-on relations,
development, with the building renovations and curriculum
changes, was initiated by task-oriented behavior. This articu-
lation of actions-oriented behavior enables leaders to blend
both the behavioral orientation of relations and task simulta-
neously and, where necessary, to achieve school effective-
ness. However, too much concern for followership can
sometime divert from actual task and can generate weak-
nesses rather than strength.
The school principal's versatility in articulating a behav-
ioral orientation, that attained the vision of the higher level
national educational authority, was achieved by empowering
the school actors through relational bonding between indi-
viduals and within the team. Her leadership actions-oriented
behavior, of distributing some of her works to the in-group,
also leaped the school toward success.
Moreover, the vice principal supported the actions-ori-
ented behavior of the principal regarding distribution of
authority to trusted in-group, which afforded time for the
principal to concentrate on the developmental aspects of
school, rather than being completely absorbed by daily rou-
tine activities. The actions orientation toward high-on rela-
tions of the leader also articulated her SACI in generating the
driving forces vigorous by showing appreciation for the
school actors. This appreciation motivated the school teach-
ers performance, and to keep pace with the radically chang-
ing environments. Team building played a significant role in
accomplishing the mission of internationalizing the school.
Actions-oriented behavior for participation and supportive-
ness toward the school actors substantially improved staff
performance as a result of improved motivation due to the
appreciation they received for their efforts.
In Finland, complementing and giving praise are not the
cultural norm. However, articulating actions-oriented behav-
ior toward a high-on relations orientation encouraged and
motivated the school actors through the acknowledgment of
their work. Therefore, the actions-oriented relational behav-
ior of the principal empowered her to win trust from within
the followership domain. In support of this view, Teacher 2
acknowledged,
6 SAGE Open
I admire for her bold decision-making nature whenever needed.
You need to have this guts when you are handling 50 teachers. I
really respect her for her sharp mind.
Moreover, an actions-oriented leadership behavioral approach
combines the essential leadership components toward man-
agement of timing, tasking, and teaming by effectively inter-
acting the organizational vision, and fostering trust of
integration within the professional communities. In this
school, the leadership for task orientation within the educa-
tional areas was shared with the vice principal. The vice prin-
cipal aligned her strategy with that of the principal, thus
maintaining a high-on relations-oriented behavior with close
monitoring of the task.
Leadership Actions-Oriented Behavior: The Case
of School B
Articulating the blend between relations- and task-oriented
behaviors generates actions-oriented behavior, which the
leader directs through their practical intelligence grounded in
the leader's SACI. This articulation of behavioral orienta-
tions enables leadership effectiveness. According to
Batagiannis (2011), effective leaders establish an identity for
analyzing the learning and leading through deep transforma-
tions. According to Currie and Lockett (2007), leaders need
to adhere to the four components of transformational leader-
ship (Bass, 1985; Burns, 1978), which are as follows: charis-
matic, inspirational, individual consideration, and intellectual
stimulation.
These leadership transformational elements enhance lead-
ership flexibility by developing an understanding of the con-
textual setting, and articulating the appropriate behavior by
blending either high-on task or low-on relations and vice
versa. Task- and relations-oriented behaviors cannot be sepa-
rated, but blending these two behavioral orientations can
generate a flexibility of leadership style. In connection to
this, Hersey and Blanchard (1977) proposed various leader-
ship behaviors such as task-oriented behavior, relations-ori-
ented behavior, combination of task and relations behavior,
and neither task nor relations behavior. Nevertheless, blend-
ing these two behaviors appropriately, and to the degree that
suits the immediate context, is determined by the context and
the followership domain (Rajbhandari, 2006). Moreover,
appropriate blending can generate leadership effectiveness
and leader success, which can be articulated through leader-
ship actions-oriented behavior by understanding the immedi-
ate context and the followership, and adopting the appropriate
behavioral pattern that suits the immediate context.
In most cases, school leaders attempt to adapt leadership
behavior by combining task and relations. However, rela-
tional behavior is responsive to sensitivity, emotionality, and
attitudinal, and enables the leaders' low flexibility. However,
task-oriented behavior achieves effectiveness and organiza-
tional commitment. Blending both task and relations, toward
articulating actions-orientated behavior high-on relations, is
important in maintaining a harmonious organizational cli-
mate and for leadership success.
Articulating actions-oriented behavior can be productive
if a balance between relations and task orientation is
achieved. In seeking harmony, a relational orientation is
important; whereas to remain effective, task orientation is
necessary. Articulating an appropriate blend of these two
behaviors depends on leader intellectual actions and experi-
ence, within that contextual setting, and leader SACI.
Rajbhandari (2012) states that a driving leadership style
incorporates leaders SACI for timing toning, tasking, team-
ing, and transforming. These are the essential components
needed for any leaders to learn, to know, and to understand
the contextual setting and its variables within the micro level,
meso level, and macro level of educational settings. This is
accomplished by articulating actions-oriented behavior by
blending task- and relations-oriented behaviors appropri-
ately in a balanced way. Accordingly, the principal of School
B articulated her actions orientation by blending high-on
task and low-on relations. She supports this view by saying,
Here in Finland our way of working is quite lenient but
sometimes it's essential to be autocratic, especially when you
need to take decision promptly on difficult matters. In those
cases you need to be strict so that you can implement your work
on time.
In response to the principal's actions-oriented behavior with
a high-on tasks orientation, Special Teacher 1 showed sup-
port for this approach when she said,
She is [a] very hard working person and she expects the same
from us which is good. She remains isolated from us and likes to
have control over the school matters, she believes in sharing the
responsibilities equally, she is an example herself but she is not
being able to devote her time in our teaching lesson. I also think
that she demands too much from us.
This view of the leader's actions-oriented behavior with a
high-on task orientation was also supported by the vice
principal:
She is demanding but I like, she expects a lot from us which I
like it, she like to do things promptly and properly, she is
organized and structured. I think she expect a lot from us. There
are clear line of responsibility for us to carry it out. She is a kind
of person, who wants responsibility of the organization but she
is not into relations.
Articulating actions-orientated behavior with a high-on task
orientation is important to ensure that the matter at hand is
addressed, and which often requires immediate action. This
articulation of behavior produces an autocratic behavioral
style, which initiates the leaders to illustrate their SACI for
actions on urgent matters. In this regard, the principal said,
Rajbhandari 7
I present myself as a strict person inside the organization. One
has to come out from their comfort zone to work harder for the
betterment of their organization; this is the reason of me being
strict and not having a democratic approach.
An actions-oriented behavior with a high-on task orientation
was demonstrated by the principal; however, the principal
also articulated an actions-oriented behavior that was low-on
relations while working with the people. Moreover, the prin-
cipal articulated her behavior toward the task by working
even harder herself. However, the principal does have con-
cern for people and her actions strategy for managing people
was articulated as management by walking around (MBWA).
Teacher 1 described the principal's actions-oriented behavior
toward relations in the following way:
She is trustworthy though demanding, but very reliable. If she
makes a decision now she will stick to it. Her opinion doesn't
change for any new ideas. She is a very organized person. I like
the way how she looks around the school matters, makes
summary and process them. She is quite good in handling
matters and making conclusive decisions.
Moreover, within the transformational leadership theory,
leadership intellectual stimulation with a relational actions
orientation was evidenced, in this case, by the principal
greeting the people by implying MBWA and evaluating the
employees with their task executions relative to organiza-
tional performances contributed in leadership effectiveness.
This, in return, generated an actions orientation that blended
both behavioral patterns in an appropriate way. Moreover,
the leader's strategic management of managing people, by
implying MBWA, also promoted relations building and
information sharing. Teacher 3 mentions,
I like our principal because she is very down to earth. She has
time for everybody. While walking down the corridor, if we stop
her and ask her something, she gives us time. She looks very
confident and calm.
Articulating a leadership actions-oriented behavior toward
high-on task, while maintaining consistency and reliability,
additionally contributed to the principal acquiring trust from
within the followership domain. This view was further sup-
ported by Teacher 2, who states,
She is a very peaceful person. In terms of financial matters, I
have trust on her and I think she also trusts me as well.
Although her actions orientation indicates low-on relations
but high-on task, it was evident that leadership effective-
ness is evaluated by the results of articulating the behav-
ioral blend. Nevertheless, effectiveness is achieved by
leadership ability to quickly assess the contextual varia-
tions and transforming according to their intellectuality that
is generated from the leader's contextual intelligence,
contextual experience, and SACI, and then to articulate the
behavioral pattern best suited to the needs of that situation.
Reflecting on this, Teacher 2 admits,
When I speak, she listen to me and never interrupts, which I like
about her. She is demanding and I am ok with it, as I believe that
I am in an expert group.
In educational settings, leaders are often redeployed to dif-
ferent academic places with the anticipation of bringing
about cumulative-progressive development in the system
where urgent changes are needed. Nevertheless, the success
of a school highly depends on the leadership SACI and
behavioral orientation. Leadership behavior is also influ-
enced by the contextual variations and the cultural environs
of the organizational settings, which can include the legacy
left by the former leader. This legacy can have a strong effect
on cultural binding, which can be difficult to change.
Moreover, new leaders bring along a new culture. Therefore,
new leadership approaches and styles can have an immense
impact on instigating changes in the school culture. For this
to occur in a harmonious manner, it is necessary for the
leader to articulate actions-orientated behavior by evaluating
the situational variables. This principal initially adopted a
leadership behavioral style toward high-on task-oriented
behavior, which allowed her to "put things together" and fur-
ther enabled the delegation of authority. Meanwhile, in this
initial phase of "settling in" to the new organizational struc-
ture, and discarding the legacy of the former leader, the new
appointee had to initially centralize power and then delegate
appropriately. For this to be maintained in a professional
way, leadership actions-oriented behavior enabled the princi-
pal to initiate the blending of behavioral orientations by
focusing high-on tasks and low-on relational approaches.
The vice principal indicated this behavioral approach of the
principal when it came to reengineering the school structural
context for accountability and responsibility. He mentions,
She does everything quite very fast to change, this is because
with the former principal, he wasn't taking leadership. Talking
about our previous principal, he doesn't have leadership
qualities, so the schools leadership went into the hands of, for
instant, mathematician group, Finnish language teacher groups
or sometime English teachers group. The power were spread
everywhere. The former principal does not have his own power
and willingness in his decision. Our present principal took all
the authority back for herself. She made clear to everyone her
responsibilities. Of course, there were some opposing but she
was very prompt and fast in her work by restructuring and
reorganizing the distributed powers and responsibilities that
were previously shared unsystematically amongst the groups of
schools members.
In many cases, articulating the appropriate blend of behav-
iors is difficult, and may not suit the situational variations.
This can reflect as a single-sided behavioral adaptation either
8 SAGE Open
too high on task or too high on relations. Although high-on
task-oriented behavior influences leadership to adopt an
autocratic leadership style, this leadership style does not nec-
essarily have to be instructive with the people in an organiza-
tion. However, this single-sided style can remain strongly
attached within a working environment by adapting behav-
ioral attitude, which enables the employees to follow the
organization's systematic behavioral procedures. The vice
principal states this behavioral by stating,
She is with us but her prime concern and priority always lies
within the organization for making the school better for all of us
and the students that leads to progress and development.
In addition, Teacher 2 supported this view by saying,
At the time of changes, we need a strong leader, who can lead us
and the school and I think she is the one, who have strong
willingness to bring about changes and development.
Articulating the right blend to combine task and relations ori-
entation is complex. However, actions toward maintaining
leadership equilibrium by adapting both these behaviors can
bring about organizational effectiveness by doing the right
things at the right time. In connection to support the view of
the vice principal, Teacher 1 described the leadership behav-
ioral articulation of orienting actions toward high-on task
and low-on relations by saying,
I think some of my colleagues experienced that our principal is
very strict. But you know, sometimes you need to have this kind
of strict behavior, when you are in such a position. Being a
principal she has to take care of everything, which sometimes
makes the situation quite difficult and complicated.
In addition to leadership autocratic behavior, the principal
also exhibited democratic behavior, which reflected an
actions orientation that blends relations-oriented behavior
with task-orientated behavior. Moreover, the results suggest
that the principal is most often engaged with the working
atmosphere; this limits her from displaying relations-ori-
ented behavior as, and when, needed by the followership
domain. Moreover, the Finnish method of good relational
behavior is to offer ample space to the employees, by good
faith, and by trusting them with their work. Appraising and
complementing are not cherished as this is not common cul-
ture in Finland.
The principal of School B articulated her actions-oriented
behavior toward high-on task due to the contextual setting of
the organization. This was also due to the legacy left by the
former school leader, which generated disturbances through
the uneven distribution of authority and power to the school
staff. Hence, to centralize the unwisely distributed authori-
ties, the leader's actions strategy was to enhance reengineer-
ing the structural reform and decentralize the accountability
to those best suited. This situation, therefore, influenced the
school principal to articulate a single-sided orientation and
adopt an autocratic style of leadership, as her actions orienta-
tion tended toward high-on task-orientated behavior and
low-on relational approaches.
Leadership Actions-Oriented Behavior: The Case
of School C
Action-oriented behavior that blends task and relations to the
appropriate degree enables the leader to maintain leadership
success and effectiveness, and satisfy the followership
domain. The followership domain accepts the leadership's
actions-oriented behavior if this leadership behavior satisfies
the immediate context and ensures, and potentially enhances,
future satisfaction. House (1996) adds that leader behavior is
accepted within the followership domain if it aims to satisfy
the instrumental values of the followers. As stated, relations-
and task-oriented behavior is not mutually exclusive. It is the
leader's SACI that blends it appropriately by articulating an
actions orientation between these two behaviors, which may
either be high or low on both these behaviors as determined
by the extant contextual variations.
According to Leithwood, Days, Sammons, Harris, and
Hopkins (2006), leadership behavior can fluctuate and so
does the effectiveness. Not all organizations are alike.
Organizational values, culture, and people differ from one
another, and so does the leader. Thus, leadership effectiveness
is interconnected with the organizational structure, context,
people's maturity, and the organizational system. These vari-
ables have a profound impact on leadership effectiveness.
According to behavioral leadership theory, blending rela-
tions and task orientation appropriately, and articulating
actions-oriented behavior, can generate leadership effective-
ness and success. This blending of behaviors can vary
according to organizational context. This can further enable
the actions-oriented behavior of leaders to articulate high or
low on either behavior, which is mediated by practical intel-
ligence and SACI. The results suggest that the principal of
School C articulated actions-oriented behavior toward high-
on task orientation, for which Teacher 2 mentions,
She wants control of everything as she is in that top position; she
hasn't felt that she has that power naturally. This is also because
she wants to keep aloof from the teachers.
Although effectiveness is desired by all, it is equally neces-
sary to desire and accept leadership effectiveness. Leadership
effectiveness means also accepting a leader's actions orienta-
tion toward the achievement of goals. This requires greater
focus on tasks than relations. Therefore, leadership effective-
ness brings school success. Although success and effective-
ness are often viewed as the same, it is not the same within
leadership study. Success can be achieved through a high-on
relations orientation; whereas effectiveness is achieved by a
high-on tasks orientation. Therefore, to achieve both success
Rajbhandari 9
and effectiveness, actions-oriented behavior requires the
appropriate blend of both relations and task orientations to
satisfy, and be accepted by, the followership domain. Thus,
articulating the appropriate blend of relations and task enables
a leadership actions orientation that initiates a systematic
approach within task parameters, and that builds a harmoni-
ous cultural environment through relations, which offers a
leader success and effectiveness. However, if effectiveness
only is a primary concern of the organization, then an actions
orientation high-on task is essential to generate standard oper-
ating procedures and policies that school actors abide by.
However, actions orientations that are high-on task-oriented
behavior may not satisfy the followership. This is supported
by the principal, who explains her leadership autocratic style
and task-oriented behavior in the following manner:
I am demanding person and I do demand more from myself than
with others. My job as a principal is to focus on the betterment
of the school and the children. I am always with my staff if they
are willing to follow the rules and regulations as instructed by
the law and educational act. This way we all can strengthen and
this may not make all happy.
Interestingly, is an autocratic style always a consequence of
a high-on task actions orientation? Although an autocratic
style and task-oriented behavior offer similar views, they do
differ. Behaviors are responsive to change, whereas style is
grounded in personality, which is inflexible and difficult to
change. Moreover, the personality of School C's principal
reflected an autocratic style, and her behavioral orientation
was articulated toward a high-on task behavioral orientation.
Nevertheless, her behavior-articulated actions orientation of
blending both task and relations was shown by recalling the
distributed powers from the followership domain, and then
reallocating it to in-groups members who were effective and
committed to the change and development of the school.
Teacher 3 states,
Our school principal as a leader, she is a very strict person. If
you do your work properly then you get support from her. If you
are lacking in your task then you will find yourself to be in
trouble with her. I feel that she is fair to all because nowadays in
school, sometimes we have to deal with difficult parents, in that
case if you are doing your work properly then you get support
from the boss.
The results suggest that the recalling of the previously
unwisely distributed power was essential to bring about cul-
tural changes in the school. This actions orientation resulted
in the principal demonstrating an autocratic leadership style
by articulating task-oriented behavior, which was profoundly
suitable to the immediate contextual setting. This articulation
of actions orientation toward high-on task was contextually
necessary to implement the instructions from the higher edu-
cational authorities. Therefore, the urgency for change also
caused her to follow the rules and procedures of legal
policies of the roles and responsibilities of the principalship
as mentioned in the contractual statement. In connection to
this, Teachers 3 mentions,
She likes to take all the authority in her hand. Our previous
principal was not like that. He used to delegate all his work to all
the staff. He used to trust his vice principal, teachers and
administrative staff. It's not like he didn't want to work but those
can be better done by us rather than he would do them. But this
principal wants to do everything by herself and she is working
from morning to evening.
Actions-oriented behavior enables the leader to articulate the
behavioral pattern appropriately to achieve both leadership
success and leadership effectiveness. Accordingly, at the
time of dramatic changes that need to be urgently imple-
mented, the school principal articulated her actions-oriented
behavior by blending high-on task and low-on relations,
which was appropriate at the initial phase. This enabled her
to completely rely on and follow the standard procedures and
policies of principalship. Furthermore, her personality dem-
onstrated an autocratic style, while her actions-oriented
behavior articulated high-on task and low-on relations.
Supporting this view, Teacher 4 explains the leader's auto-
cratic style and her behavior by saying,
She is very demanding and strict with the rules and policies. We
have to follow the state rules and we need to fill the papers before
the deadline and she is very particular with all these official
matters. She works too much and she does make everything sure
that everyone is doing at their best in their duties.
Although actions orientation toward high-on task offers
effectiveness, the blending of these two behavioral patterns
appropriately can offer both success and effectiveness. This
actions-oriented behavior, of articulating the blend of behav-
ioral patterns, generates motivation and commitment. In con-
nection to this view, the principal's actions orientation of
blending both behaviors appropriately, toward high-on task
and low-on relations, offered motivation to committed school
actors. In addition, the actions orientation also maintained a
conducive working environment and teacher satisfaction.
Teacher 1 explains the professional conducive environment
of the school by saying,
Here in Finland, teachers have lots of liberty to think about their
work. They can do their work the way they want them to do. So
far we have a good working relationship with each other.
Everyone respects one another and you know, it's you who gets
on better with teachers but at least everyone has good
professional relationship. A good professional relations doesn't
mean that we have to become best friends; professional
relationship essential.
To maintain work professionalism, school leaders need to be
confident, have good communicating skills, and have trust
among and between followers and in the followership
10 SAGE Open
domain. Articulating actions-oriented behavior by focusing
on high-on task is not an easy behavioral pattern for a leader
to adopt, unless the leader has complete knowledge about the
work and understanding of organizational climate. Therefore,
articulating an actions orientation toward high-on task also
requires leaders to be confident within the professional com-
munity, to communicate the organizational vision, and to win
the followership domain with a level of trust to collaborate in
team building.
In educational settings, the followership domain is com-
prised of mature and intelligent individuals. This enables the
leader to work with teams by building the level of trust
among and between the leaders and the followership domain,
which makes the organization successful while retaining
work effectiveness. Moreover, both the success and effec-
tiveness of leadership are interrelated with leader confidence
and experience. In this connection, Teacher 2 mentions the
principal's confidence in this way,
I also think that she is that type of person who desire perfection;
that's why she is handling everything by herself. She is very
confident in working and she knows what she is doing.
The results also suggest that, within the followership domain,
school actors felt that, although the principal's experience
and confidence was leading the school toward success, the
trust level from the leader toward the staff was low. This is
because the principal had not been completely able to under-
stand the contextual variations and climatic environment.
Although actions orientation toward an autocratic style that
is high-on task can lead to organization effectiveness through
change and development, it may not completely enable the
school leader to learn, know, and understand the context, fol-
lowership, and the followers. Teacher 4 comments on this
behavior of the principal by saying,
She wants to handle everything by herself. She wants to have
control in everything. Sometimes she gives us feeling that we
are not trusted, however for me, it is not a problem.
Although this principal's actions orientation enabled task
achievement, she failed to build a level of trust with the fol-
lowership. However, this actions orientation enabled the
leader to completely rely on the educational law and regula-
tions. This furthermore generated teacher commitment at work
by allocating additional work hours for reporting, as stated in
the educational law. This commitment of school actors was
found to be an attitudinal commitment that was driven by the
leadership's actions-oriented behavior high-on task.
Moreover, teachers held expectations regarding the school
leader, which was collaboration in a relational manner. The
school actors believed that the leader's actions orientation
toward high-on relations would motivate them and lead to
high commitment. Teachers also expected from the school
leader an appropriate blending of both task and relations in
her actions orientation, by enhancing participation and sup-
port to further enhance goal achievement. Hersey and
Blanchard (1977) support the view that appropriate blending
of behavioral patterns can produce the right "energy" leading
toward motivation and commitment, and create a good cli-
mate within an organization. This articulation of behavior is
influenced by a leader's personality.
In support of the role that personality plays in influencing
actions orientation, Boyle (1995) states that the personality
of an individual can contribute toward behavioral tendencies.
These behavioral tendencies are the differences in attitude,
orientations, and decision making. In addition to the behav-
ioral tendencies of school leaders, the principal in this case
showed behavioral tendencies that reflected actions-oriented
behavior toward high-on task, which enabled her to incorpo-
rate rules and regulations. These behavioral articulations
enabled her to restructure and reengineer the school's inter-
nal policy and cultural aspects by centralizing the power that
was unwisely distributed among the members. This created
effectiveness at the initial phase, enabling her to bring about
the required changes and development.
Initiating structural reform was essential in forming a new
working culture and climatic environment. This was made
possible through the principal's articulation of her actions-
oriented behavior, by blending behaviors focused high-on
task and low-on relations, which brought about effective-
ness. In addition, this improved teacher commitment to more
responsibility and accountability in their work. Moreover,
articulating the blend of behavioral patterns appropriately is
essential. This equally concerned time, task, and individuals.
While reflecting upon the school leadership actions-oriented
behavior, the principal was more concerned with time and
task. Reciprocally, this behavior of greater concern for time
and task impacted on the followership domain, thus generat-
ing a mirror-effect (Rajbhandari, 2016b) from leader to fol-
lower, leadership to followership, and vice versa.
Discussion and Conclusion
Leadership behavior of relations and task orientation is not
mutually exclusive. Moreover, appropriate blending of these
two behaviors is essential and is achieved by articulating
either high-on task or low-on relations, or high-on relations
and low-on task, or high-high on both and vice versa.
Appropriate articulation of the behavioral blend generates
the actions-oriented behavioral style. This is produced by the
leader's SACI.
Leaders' SACI articulates behavioral orientations by
focusing both on task and relations, appropriately generating
an actions orientation that fits the context and followership,
which, in return, enables leaders to become successful and
effective. Nevertheless, articulating the needed behavior
appropriately requires leadership flexibility and mobility;
this is generated by the leadership's SACI. This leadership
flexibility and mobility, grounded in SACI, enables the
Rajbhandari 11
leaders to become acquainted with the contextual settings,
and to understand the followership domain. Although leader-
ship effectiveness and success depends largely upon the
leader's SACI, it is equally important to know and under-
stand the followership in an organization. Therefore, it can
be said that knowing and understanding the followership
domain is the key ingredient in enabling leadership success
and effectiveness. Thus, articulating an actions-oriented
behavior grounded in leadership SACI, and by blending rela-
tions and task appropriately to suit the followership domain,
can enhance both leadership and followership success and
effectiveness.
Toward the articulation and blending of behavior, School
A's principal adopted an actions orientation that was highly
focused on a relational approach. This may have been due to
the personality factor that naturally caused her to remain
democratic and participative. However, in School B and
School C, the principals articulated an actions-oriented
behavior that was high-on task orientation. Although both
task and relations orientation are not mutually exclusive,
they can be articulated simultaneously either by executing
high or low on either orientation, depending on the contex-
tual variables. Furthermore, in Finland, school leaders exe-
cuted both behavioral approaches appropriately, which
contributed to the improvement of the school, and toward
changes and development. Moreover, this was possible by
articulating appropriate behavioral patterns according to the
needs of the context.
Although both relations and task orientation are equally
important, the results suggest that an actions orientation
toward high-on relations generates less leadership flexibility
than an actions orientation toward high-on task. The results
also suggest that school leaders who articulated an actions
orientation high-on task were expected to reorientate their
behavior toward relations by the followership domain.
However, the followership domain did not expect leadership
with an actions orientation high-on relations to change toward
a high-on task-orientated behavior. This is also supported by
Rajbhandari (2013), as his research findings suggest that
leadership elasticity is high on leadership task orientation,
and less in relations orientation behavior. The results of this
study collaborate his findings that task-oriented behavioral
styles of leaders are effective, while relations orientation
behavior is more likely to achieve efficiency.
The actions-oriented behavior of School A's principal,
which was high-on relations and low-on task, resulted in her
exhibiting a democratic leadership style. This further enabled
her to collaborate and participate within the followership
domain. This behavioral pattern generated leadership suc-
cess and motivated the followership to accommodate
changes. The motivation was achieved through social inter-
action within the followership domain and between leader-
ship and followership. However, the actions orientation of
the leaders of School B and School C, which were high-on
task and low-on relations, resulted in a degree of autocratic
leadership, which enabled these principals to achieve leader-
ship effectiveness. This articulation of behavior enabled the
followership domain to steer their behavioral pattern toward
adopting changes and development through commitment.
Although both behavioral orientations are equally essen-
tial to achieving motivation and commitment, the orientation
is best determined by the situation and the contextual varia-
tions. Therefore, a school leadership's approach to articulat-
ing their actions orientations, either focusing on relations or
task, depends upon the contextual setting and the immediate
concerns of the organization in bringing about change and
development.
Situations and contextual variations dominate leadership
actions orientation. Thus, it is essential for school leaders to
understand their immediate contextual need and organiza-
tional variables. Reaching such an understanding offers
school leaders the ability to articulate their actions orienta-
tion by appropriately blending relations and task to best suit
the immediate context and organizational variables. Doing
so can generate leadership success and effectiveness, and
furthermore enhance motivation and commitment among the
followership.
In the case of School A, the school leader had spent a long
period at the same school. This offered her intimately knowl-
edge of the organizational variables, and allowed her to blend
within the followership domain. This enabled her to com-
pletely understand how the followership domain functions
and how their needs can best be satisfied for the present and
in the future, which she was able to build through a system-
atic approach of bonding and banking between leader and
followers. Therefore, her actions orientation articulated
high-on relations to strengthen this systematic approach even
more, leading thus to successful changes and development
during the radical overhauling of the school organization.
Moreover, in School B and School C, newly appointed
school principals initially oriented their actions toward high-
on task to gain school effectiveness, but were simultaneously
learning about the organizational context and followership
domain. The results suggest that this actions-oriented behav-
ior focusing high on task was essential to allow them to
accommodate change and development at the time of dra-
matic restructuring. This was because, both these principals
had to deal with contextual variations in the cultural founda-
tion influenced by the legacy of the former principals.
However, because School B's principal had spent more time
in the school as compared with School C's principal, her
actions orientation toward relational approaches was higher
in comparison with School C's principal.
The legacy of former principals created a contrary cul-
tural foundation to that of the new leaders' expectations. In
such a case, an ice-breaking actions strategy was of utmost
importance in reengineering and restructuring the organiza-
tion to regain and recall the unwisely distributed powers.
This was achieved by initially centralizing it, and then redis-
tributing it within the committed followership domain to
12 SAGE Open
build a systematic bond and bank. It was an essential actions
orientation toward accommodating change and develop-
ment. Moreover, new appointees, new education policies,
and newly applied actions-oriented leadership behavior
toward achieving these aspects generated a new context.
This further generated variations in the context and in the
followership domain.
The results show that the environmental context of School
B and School C required the articulation of an actions orienta-
tion that was high-on task, which brought about change and
development to accommodate the organizational variables to
the leaders' expectations. Although these contextual varia-
tions can cause difficulties to the leadership and followership,
understanding the needs of immediate variables, and articu-
lating the behavioral pattern appropriately to address these
needs, can generate both leadership success and effectiveness
by enabling followership motivation and commitment.
Toward addressing internal variations to incorporate
external variables, a leader's immediate concern is to under-
stand these variations by reasoning, to take necessary courses
of action, and to anticipate the expected results with toler-
ance, which is the implication of referee leadership style
(Rajbhandari, 2013). In addition, while exploring the leader-
ship actions-oriented behavior of a relations- and task-orien-
tated blend, it was found that contextual variations externally
and internally were driving the leaders'attention toward ana-
lyzing and maintaining them to fill the gaps between these
two sets of variables. Although external variations are inevi-
table and uncontrollable, leadership abilities to cope are
strongly influences by the leadership SACI. This was articu-
lated by executing an actions-oriented behavior that was a
blend of leadership behavioral patterns tailored to the needs
of the contextual setting.
In School A, external variations arose from the instruction
by the municipality to internationalization the school and
follow special-education rules as amended in educational act
and law. In School B and School C, the external forces of
applying special-education policies combined with the inter-
nal variations due to reengineering and restructuring created
a double impact in the school environmental setting. These
contextual variations, in all the schools explored, were the
prime concern of the school leaders and their focal point.
This enabled the school leaders to articulate the appropriate
behavioral blend through an actions orientation that exhib-
ited the behaviors best suited to the contextual settings.
Drawing from the discussions, the behavioral orientation
of leadership actions orientation can be maintained by articu-
lating from high relations to low relations, and from high task
to low task, if not from between task to relations alone. This
articulation of actions orientations within the same behavioral
tendencies can prevent leaders'personality drift from causing
personality distortions and behavioral dysfunctional.
Conclusively, actions-oriented leadership behavior practi-
cally enables the leaders to articulate relations and task ori-
entation appropriately, to maintain the followership domain,
and to initiate motivation and commitment. This articulation
of behavior toward actions orientation is guided by the lead-
ership's SACI.
In this exploration, it was found that leadership actions-
oriented behavior was pragmatically articulated to meet the
immediate contextual variations. In all three schools, artic-
ulation of relations and task enabled the leader to execute
appropriate actions-orientated behavior to fill the gaps
between internal and external variations to accommodate
changes and development during a period of radical change.
It was also found that leader personalities were a key ingre-
dient in shaping leadership styles. Therefore, leadership
personality, and leadership actions orientation toward
appropriately executing relations and task, enabled the gen-
eration of motivation and commitment in the followership
domain. Furthermore, motivation was achieved through an
actions orientation that was high-on relations, and commit-
ment was achieved through an actions orientation toward
high-on task. In addition, an actions orientation toward
high-on task enabled the leaders to bring about leadership
effectiveness, and an actions orientation toward high-on
relations offered leadership success. Although there is no
single behavior that can lead to leadership success and
effectiveness, actions oriented toward blending relations
and task appropriately and thus suitable to the immediate
context can lead toward an organization's grand leap.
Moreover, contextual variation is inevitable; thus, articu-
lating leadership's actions orientation is necessary. In addi-
tion, both internal and external aspects can cause variations,
which can create a gap in leadership and followership
actions. In an effort to fill in the gaps of leadership behav-
ioral discrepancies, a flexible behavioral actions orientation
is essential. This can be maintained through leadership readi-
ness for flexibility and mobility by articulating actions orien-
tations differently from high relations to low relations, and
from high task to low task, as well as from task to relations
and vice versa. This maintains the leader's personality and
prevents distortion and dysfunctionality. In addition, appro-
priate articulation and blending induces leadership elasticity
of behavioral actions.
