Abstract
Objective: To determine whether neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) differed between patients
with isolated coronary artery disease (CAD), isolated coronary artery ectasia (CAE), coronary
slow flow and normal coronary anatomy.
Methods: Patients who underwent coronary angiography were consecutively enrolled into one of
four groups: CAD, coronary slow flow, CAE and normal coronary anatomy.
Results: The CAD (n ¼ 40), coronary slow flow (n ¼ 40), and CAE (n ¼ 40) groups had similar
NLRs (2.51 Æ 0.7, 2.40Æ 0.8, 2.6 Æ 0.6, respectively) that were significantly higher than patients with
normal coronary anatomy (n ¼ 40; NLR, 1.73Æ 0.7). Receiver operating characteristics demon-
strated that with NLR> 2.12, specificity in predicting isolated CAD was 85% and sensitivity was 75%,
with NLR > 2.22 specificity in predicting isolated CAE was 86% and sensitivity was 75%. With
NLR > 1.92, specificity in predicting coronary slow flow was 89% and sensitivity was 75%.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified NLR as an independent predictor of isolated CAE
(b ¼ À0.499, 95% CI À0.502, À0.178; P < 0.001), CAD (b ¼ À0.426, 95% CI À1.321, À0.408; P <
0.001), and coronary slow flow (b ¼ À0.430, 95% CI À0.811, À0.240; P ¼ 0.001 Table 2).
Conclusions: NLR was higher in patients with CAD, coronary slow flow and CAE versus normal
coronary anatomy. NLR may be an indicator of CAD, CAE and coronary slow flow.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis develops as a result of
inflammatory and fibro-proliferative
events, and involves several factors that
occur in response to localization of athero-
genic lipoproteins on the intima layer of the
blood vessel wall.1 Affecting older adults in
particular, atherosclerosis is a slowly pro-
gressing degenerative disease characterized
by mechanical changes in the blood stream.2
Several studies have reported that inflam-
mation plays a key role in atherosclerosis
pathogenesis, with inflammation being iden-
tified at every stage, from onset to progres-
sion, and until thrombotic complications
develop.3 White blood cells (WBCs) have
been reported to play a significant role in
atherosclerosis-related inflammatory pro-
cess,4 and identification of the relationship
between atherosclerosis and inflammation
has highlighted a role for inflammatory
indicators in determining the risk of cardio-
vascular events.5,6
The main cell types involved in inflam-
mation are WBCs, which are thought to be
accountable for unwanted events in cardio-
vascular diseases, and levels of WBCs and
their subtypes are used as indicators of
inflammatory conditions.7,8 Increased neu-
trophils, and stress-induced low lymphocyte
levels (lymphopenia) both indicate changes
in the immune system.9,10 An index that
reflects high neutrophil levels (indicating
inflammation) and post-physiologic stress-
induced lymphopenia, namely the neutro-
phil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), has been used
in studies along with other inflammatory
indicators, and determined to be a good
indicator of inflammatory conditions.11 The
NLR is shown to be a simple, reliable and
inexpensive inflammatory indicator that can
provide important information on many
conditions, such as coronary artery disease
(CAD) prevalence, and risk classification of
acute coronary syndromes.12,13
In the absence of acute coronary syn-
drome, reasons for NLR variations in
patients with isolated CAD, isolated coron-
ary artery ectasia (CAE) and isolated cor-
onary slow flow remain unclear. The aim of
the present study was to investigate whether
NLR values differ between patients with
CAD, CAE and coronary slow flow, and
patients with normal coronary anatomy in
the absence of acute coronary syndrome.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective observational study
recruited consecutive age, sex and athero-
sclerosis risk-factor matched patients who
underwent coronary angiography while
attending the cardiology clinic of Elazig

Education and Research Hospital, Elazig
 ,
Turkey between January 2015 and December
2015. Patients aged between 45 and 75 years
were consecutively recruited into one of four
groups comprising: !50% lesions in at least
one coronary artery (CAD group); coronary
slow flow only; isolated CAE; or normal
coronary anatomy. Recruitment of age, sex
and atherosclerosis risk-factor matched
patients continued during the study until
each group count reached 40 patients.
Patients diagnosed with acute coronary
syndrome, chronic kidney failure, chronic
lung disease, malignant arrhythmia, sys-
temic connective tissue diseases, heart fail-
ure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular case
history, any chronic or acute inflammatory
disease, thyroid function disorder, malig-
nancy, and/or chronic liver failure were
excluded from the study.
The study was initiated following
Presidential of T.C. Firat University Ethics
Committee approval, and was conducted
under the regulations determined by the
Helsinki Declaration. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent.

Laboratory measurements and coronary
angiography
Blood samples (6 ml for full biochemistry
and 5 ml for complete blood count) were
obtained from the antecubital vein prior to
coronary angiography and following a
12 h fast. Samples were drawn into vacuum
tubes containing 15% K3 ethylenediamine-
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and analysed
within 30 min of being drawn. Haematocrit
and haemoglobin, platelet, neutrophil,
lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil
levels were assessed using a CoulterÕ
LH 780 automated haematology analyser
via an electrical impedance method
(Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. NLR was calculated by manually
dividing the digital neutrophil and lympho-
cyte counts in 103/mm3 unit volume.
Glucose, urea, creatinine, total cholesterol,
triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
levels were measured using a chemilumin-
escence method with a CobasÕ e601 auto-
analyser and associated reagents (Roche
Diagnostics Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland)
according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Coronary angiography was performed
after blood samples were obtained, using
the Judkins technique14 with a Siemens
Axiom Artis FC diagnostic device (Siemens
Healthcare GmbH, Forchheim, Germany).
Following catheterisation, each patient
was administered 350 mg/ml Iohexol
(Amersham Health, Co. Cork, Ireland) as
the contrast agent, and coronary angiog-
raphy recordings were taken at the left
anterior oblique, and cranial and right
anterior oblique, and caudal and horizontal
positions. All angiographic examinations
were conducted by two experienced angiog-
raphy specialists (MNB and OU).
Coronary slow flow measurement
The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(TIMI) frame count method was used to
identify patients with coronary slow flow.15
To objectively assess coronary blood flow as
a continuous numerical variable, the sine-
frame count required for Iohexol contrast
agent to reach the distal end of the left
anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery
was accepted as the TIMI frame count, and
the mean of calculations for at least three
positions was used. During the measurement
period, the frame at which contrast agent
entered the artery was accepted as the first
frame, and the frame at which contrast agent
reached the distal end of the LAD coronary
artery was accepted as the last frame. The
TIMI frame count was then calculated from
the difference between the first and last
frames.16 Since the distance between prox-
imal and distal bifurcation in the LAD
coronary artery is longer than other coron-
ary arteries, LAD TIMI frame count is
significantly higher than right coronary
artery (RCA) and circumflex (Cx) artery
TIMI frame counts. A 1.7 constant coeffi-
cient is used to standardize the measure-
ments and published mean reference values
are 36 Æ 1 for LAD, 22.2 Æ 4 for Cx and
20.4 Æ 3 for RCA.15 In the present study,
values that were two units above the pub-
lished reference values were accepted as
standard, and coronary slow flow was
defined as values above 38 for LAD, above
30 for Cx and above 26 for RCA.
Coronary artery ectasia
Quantitative coronary measurements were
obtained by same-day analyses of digital
data obtained during coronary angiography
for each participant, using Scientific
Quantification Coronary Analysis software
(Siemens Healthcare Gmbh, Forcheim,
Yilmaz et al. 1445
Germany). To determine the actual width of
the coronary artery lumen, a calibration was
conducted using the catheter diameter. To
identify the artery segment as ectatic, at least
two measurements were taken at the prox-
imal, mid and distal segments of the coron-
ary arteries in patients with normal coronary
angiography and normal coronary flow, and
in patients who were considered to have an
ectatic coronary segment. If the diameter of
the artery segment was !1.5 times wider
than the mean artery diameter of patients
with normal coronary angiography and
normal coronary flow, it was accepted as
ectatic and the patient was included in the
isolated CAE group.
Isolated coronary artery disease
Coronary lesion length and percent stenosis
were assessed using a quantitative coronary
angiography method with Scientific
Quantification Coronary Analysis software,
version 14432944 (Siemens Healthcare
Gmbh), and ! 50% stenosis was accepted
as the existence of CAD. Patients with-
! 50% luminal stenosis based on angiog-
raphy were included in the CAD group.
Statistical analyses
Continuous variables are presented as
mean Æ SD and categorical variables are pre-
sented as n (%) prevalence. Kolmogorov­
Smirnov test was used to determine whether
the variables were normally distributed.
Between-group comparisons were con-
ducted using one-way analysis of variance
for continuous variables and 2-test for
categorical variables. Multivariate regres-
sion analyses were performed to determine
which clinical variables would independ-
ently predict CAE, CAD and coronary
slow flow. CAE, CAD and coronary slow
flow were entered into the regression model
as dependent variables. NLR, age, platelet
count, haematocrit, and triglyceride,
glucose, urea, and creatinine levels were
entered into the model as independent vari-
ables. Results are presented as b coefficients
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Sensitivity and specificity of NLR and
its optimal cut-off values were determined
by receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS software, ver-
sion 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All
P values were two-tailed, and values <0.05
were considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
The study included 160 consecutive patients:
40 patients with !50% lesions in at least one
coronary artery (CAD group); 40 patients
with only coronary slow flow; 40 patients
with isolated CAE; and 40 patients with
normal coronary anatomy. There were no
statistically significant differences between
the CAD, coronary slow flow, CAE and
normal coronary anatomy groups in terms
of atherosclerosis risk factors such as age,
sex, smoking, or diabetes mellitus, or in
platelets, WBC, LDL, triglycerides, haem-
atocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, Na, urea,
creatinine and K values (Table 1).
The NLR values were significantly higher
in the CAD, coronary slow flow and CAE
groups compared with the normal coronary
anatomy group (2.506 Æ 0.65, 2.403 Æ 0.75,
and 2.604 Æ 0.55 versus 1.725 Æ 0.71,
respectively; P < 0.0001). There was no stat-
istically significant difference in NLR values
between the CAD, coronary slow flow and
CAE groups (Table 1; Figure 1).
The ROC curve analysis demonstrated
that the specificity of an NLR value > 2.12
(measured prior to coronary angiography)
in predicting isolated CAD was 85% and the
sensitivity was 75% (area under the curve
[AUC] 0.863, 95% CI 0.850, 0.876;
P < 0.0001). The specificity of an NLR
value > 2.22 in predicting isolated CAE
1446 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
was 86% and the sensitivity was 75%
(AUC 0.901, 95% CI 0.820, 0.981;
P < 0.0001), and the specificity of an NLR
value > 1.92 in predicting coronary slow
flow was 89% and the sensitivity was 75%
(AUC 0.843, 95% CI 0.747, 0.940;
P < 0.0001; Figure 2).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
identified NLR as an independent predictor
for the existence of isolated CAE
(b ¼ À0.499, 95% CI À0.502, À0.178;
P < 0.001). CAD (b ¼ À0.426, 95% CI
À1.321, À0.408; P < 0.001), and coronary
slow flow (b ¼ À0.430, 95% CI À0.811,
À0.240; P ¼ 0.001; Table 2). All other inde-
pendent variables tested were not statistic-
ally significant for predicting CAE, CAD or
coronary slow flow.

Discussion
The objective of the present study was to
investigate whether NLR values differed
between three different groups of patients
with CAD, CAE or coronary slow flow, and
patients with normal coronary anatomy in
the absence of acute coronary syndrome.
The present results demonstrated that NLR
values were significantly higher in patients
with CAD, coronary slow flow and CAE
versus patients with normal coronary
anatomy.
Atherosclerosis, which is the main cause
of coronary artery disease, is a pathology
characterized by endothelial dysfunction in
the large and medium muscular arteries,
vascular inflammation, and lipid and inflam-
matory cell accumulation on the intima
layer.17,18 Although it is known that inflam-
mation plays a significant role in the onset
and progression of atherosclerotic disease,
biochemical and cellular events that initiate
and cause the progression of atherosclerosis
have not been completely explained.19
Several studies have investigated the role
and relationship between inflammation and
bio-indicators that reflect inflammatory con-
ditions and unwanted events in coronary
artery diseases.20,21 The role of inflamma-
tion is under active investigation in terms of
progression of atherosclerosis and acute and
chronic forms of artery disease, and also in
CAE and coronary slow flow.11
Coronary artery ectasia is one of the
congenital or acquired coronary anoma-
lies.22 Although CAE demonstrates a

heterogeneous etiologic character, its most
common etiologic cause among adults is
atherosclerosis.23,24 Regional or generalized
angiographic extension of 1.5 times the
normal artery diameter in epicardial coron-
ary arteries is defined as CAE, and a further
extension is defined as coronary artery
aneurism.24,25 Underlying histologic
changes in CAE have been demonstrated
as equivalent to the changes observed in
atherosclerotic lesions (generalized hyalini-
zation, intimal and medial deterioration).26
CAE might accompany occlusive coronary
artery disease, however, it may also be
observed as isolated CAE, and several
studies have reported findings that indicate
a more intense inflammation than occlusive
coronary artery disease.27,28 Investigations
into the relationship between inflammation
and CAE showed a relationship with well-
known inflammatory indicators such as
matrix metalloproteinase, interleukin-6,
tumour necrosis factor-a, WBC count,
neutrophil count, monocyte count, and
C-reactive protein (CRP).28,29 Similar
studies assessed CRP levels in patients with
isolated CAE, CAD without coronary ecta-
sia, and angiographic normal coronary
arteries. CRP levels were found to be
higher in patients with CAE than the other
two groups and it was claimed that a more
intense inflammatory process could be active
in patients with CAE versus patients
with CAD.20,27
Coronary slow flow is a condition char-
acterized by the slowing down of coronary
artery flow rate, and is defined as delay in the
filling of epicardial coronary arteries with
contrast agent without the existence of
stenosis.30 The underlying mechanisms and
aetiology remain unknown, however, stu-
dies have shown that endothelial dysfunc-
tion, vasomotor dysfunction, microvascular
disease and generalized atherosclerosis may
play a role in aetiopathogenesis.31­34 In
patients with coronary slow flow, studies
have identified lengthwise extensive
calcification without narrowing the lumen,
diffuse intimal thickening, and atheroma
plaques in the vessel wall.33­35 Significant
differences have also been observed between
proximal-distal coronary artery pressure
(reflecting the increase in microcirculation
resistance) and fractional flow reserve values
compared with healthy controls.36 As a
result of these findings, it was concluded
that coronary slow flow is an atherosclerotic
process in the capillaries and large vessels
that results in an increase in microvascular
resistance. Endothelial activation and
inflammation may play a significant role in
coronary slow flow pathogenesis.37,38
Two studies have shown that NLR could
be used as a parameter that indicates both
neutrophil elevation, which reflects acute
inflammation, and low lymphocyte levels,
which reflects physiologic stress.39,40
Furthermore, high NLR in patients with
both stable CAD and acute coronary syn-
drome may be an independent predictor of
coronary atherosclerosis progression.41
WBC count and WBC sub-type ratios
could be used as indicators of inflammation
in cardiovascular diseases,42 and WBC
count and sub-types have been demon-
strated as important inflammatory indica-
tors in predicting cardiovascular
outcomes.43
In the current study, NLR was found to
be significantly higher in patients with at
least 50% or more lesions in at least one
coronary artery, in patients with coronary
slow flow, and in patients with CAE, versus
patients with normal coronary anatomy.
These findings are consistent with published
results that considered NLR as an inde-
pendent predictive parameter in coronary
artery disease onset and progression.40,44
The results of the present study are
limited by the relatively low number of
patients included in the research, the exclu-
sion of patients with acute coronary syn-
drome, and the lack of comparison between
NLR and other inflammatory indicators.
1450 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
Another limitation is the fact that, as
demonstrated by intravascular ultrasound
and autopsy studies conducted in cases of
atherosclerotic heart disease, the vessel
lumen could be observed as normal even
though there is an atherosclerotic plaque
over a wide area.45,46 Finally, the study
lacked intravascular ultrasound in the diag-
nosis of normal coronary anatomy, isolated
CAE and coronary slow flow.
In conclusion, NLR is an inexpensive,
routinely used inflammatory indicator that
can be obtained during complete blood
counts. The present study attempted to
measure the inflammatory process by calcu-
lating NLR, and demonstrated that NLR
was higher in patients diagnosed with CAD,
isolated CAE and coronary slow flow using
angiography versus patients with normal
coronary anatomy, and may be an indicator
of CAD, CAE and coronary slow flow in the
absence of acute coronary syndrome. There
was no statistically significant difference,
however, between NLRs in these three car-
diovascular groups that represented differ-
ent variants of coronary artery disease.
