Abstract
The overall purpose of this study is to contribute to bridging the gap between people- and
place-oriented approaches in the study of crime causation. To achieve this we will explore some
core hypotheses derived from Situational Action Theory about what makes young people crime
prone and makes places criminogenic, and about the interaction between crime propensity and
criminogenic exposure predicting crime events. We will also calculate the expected reduction
in aggregate levels of crime that will occur as a result of successful interventions targeting crime
propensity and criminogenic exposure. To test the hypotheses we will utilize a unique set of
space­time budget, small area community survey, land-use and interviewer-led questionnaire data
from the prospective longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study
(PADS+) and an artificial neural network approach to modelling. The results show that people's
crime propensity (based on their personal morals and abilities to exercise self-control) has the
bulk of predictive power, but also that including criminogenic exposure (being unsupervised
with peers and engaged in unstructured activities in residential areas of poor collective efficacy

or commercial centres) demonstrates a substantial increase in predictive power (in addition to
crime propensity). Moreover, the results show that the probability of crime is strongest when
a crime-prone person is in a criminogenic setting and, crucially, that the higher a person's crime
propensity the more vulnerable he or she is to influences of criminogenic exposure. Finally, the
findings suggest that a reduction in people's crime propensity has a much bigger impact on their
crime involvement than a reduction in their exposure to criminogenic settings.

Two core criminological findings are that the distribution of crime in the population is
highly skewed ­ a small minority of people are responsible for a majority of crimes (for
example, Piquero et al., 2007: 17­19; Wikström, 1990; Wolfgang et al., 1972) ­ and that
crime events (and particular types of crime events) tend to be concentrated in space and
time ­ sometimes referred to as hotspots (for example, Sherman et al., 1989; Weisburd
et al., 2012; Wikström, 1991). Criminological theories (and research) tend to focus on
the role of either people (propensities) or places (environmental inducements) in crime
causation; rarely do they consider how both may be explained (and analysed) within a
common theoretical framework. And yet arguably neither can be adequately explained
(and studied) without taking the other into consideration (Wikström and Treiber, 2016).
Discussing individual (people) and community (place) oriented research traditions in
criminology, Albert Reiss Jr. convincingly argued quite some time ago that `more is to be
gained by linking those traditions than by their continued separate development and test-
ing' (1986: 29). To bridge this divide and integrate key insights about the role of people
and places in crime causation, and to move beyond (at times) unfruitful competition and
conflict between person- and place-oriented approaches, we argue that (proper) situa-
tional analysis should form the foundation of criminological theory. However, `research-
ers have thus far done little to develop a systematic situational perspective' (LaFree and
Birkbeck, 1991: 73), a statement that is still largely valid.
To overcome the neglect of (proper) situational analysis and advance knowledge
about crime and its causes, we specifically maintain that criminology needs at its core (i)
an adequate action theory1 that helps integrate key insights from people- and place-ori-
ented approaches (Kroneberg et al., 2010; Wikström, 2004), and (ii) data and methodolo-
gies that better allow us to study the role of and test hypotheses about the
person­environment interaction (Wikström et al., 2012a). In this study we aim to help
bridge the gap between people- and place-oriented approaches and advance knowledge
­ theoretically, methodologically and empirically ­ about the person­environment inter-
action in crime causation. Guided by Situational Action Theory, and utilizing a unique
set of space­time budget, small area community survey, land-use and interviewer-led
questionnaire data from the prospective longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and
Young Adult Development Study (PADS+) and an artificial neural network approach to
modelling, we will explore some hypotheses about what makes people crime prone and
12 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
makes places (settings) criminogenic, and specifically test the interactional hypothesis
that young people vary in their vulnerability to criminogenic exposure depending on
their level of crime propensity.
Situational Action Theory
Situational Action Theory (SAT) is a general, dynamic and mechanism-based theory of
crime causation (for example, Wikström, 2006, 2010, 2014). It analyses crime as acts of
rule-breaking and stresses the importance of the person­environment interaction and the
need to properly understand and explicate the action mechanism that links people and
their immediate environments to their actions, such as acts of crime. SAT insists that
people are the source of their actions (people perceive, choose and execute their actions)
but that the causes of their actions are situational (people's particular perception of action
alternatives, process of choice and execution of action are triggered and guided by the
relevant input from the person­environment interaction).
Whereas most major criminological theories (such as control and opportunity theo-
ries2) seem to work under the (human nature) assumption that people's action choices are
mainly driven by self-interest (Agnew, 2014), SAT asserts that humans are essentially
rule-guide creatures and society (social order) is based on shared rules of conduct
(Wikström, 2010). SAT defines and analyses acts of crime as moral actions, that is,
`actions which are guided by value-based rules of conduct specifying what is the right or
wrong thing to do (or not do) in response to particular motivations in particular circum-
stances'. Acts of crime are specifically defined as `breaches of rules of conduct stated in
law', and this is what all acts of crime, in all places, at all times, have in common. SAT
asserts that the same process that explains why people follow or break rules of law should
also explain why they follow or break other kinds of moral rules (for example, informal
rules of conduct).
Most leading criminological theory tends to focus on either person-oriented or envi-
ronment-oriented explanatory factors (although some theories pay lip-service to the
importance of both, they typically do not explicate in any detail ­ or at all ­ how personal
and environmental factors interact in the explanation of acts of crime3). To bridge this
divide, and integrate key insights about the role of people and places in crime causation,
we need to focus on situational analysis. While most uses of the term `situation'in crimi-
nology seem to refer to the immediate environment and most `situational analyses' seem
to differentiate between people and situations (see, for example, Birkbeck and LaFree,
1993), SAT maintains that a situation is a particular person's perception of action alterna-
tives (on which basis he or she makes choices) that emerge when he or she takes part in
a certain setting (immediate environment) facing a particular potent motivator. A situa-
tion is thus not the setting (immediate environment) but the particular perception of
action alternatives in response to a potent motivator that appear out of a specific person­
environment interaction (Figure 1).
SAT insists that acts of crime are always an outcome of a `person propensity ­ envi-
ronmental inducements' interaction and that crime cannot be properly understood by
focusing on just one aspect. A person's particular crime propensities are triggered by
specific features of a setting, and a setting's particular criminogenic inducements are
Wikström et al. 13
made relevant by a person's specific propensities (although the relative importance of a
person's crime propensities and a setting's criminogenic inducements may vary by cir-
cumstance). However, to argue that acts of crime are an outcome of the person­environ-
ment interaction does not take us far in explaining why crime happens. It is only when we
can identify what makes people crime prone and what makes environments crimino-
genic, and, crucially, specify how their interaction may trigger acts of crime, that we have
reached some understanding of the causes of crime.
Against the background that people are rule-guided creatures and that crime is essen-
tially rule-breaking behaviour, SAT proposes that people's crime propensity (the ten-
dency to see and choose acts of crime as an action alternative) is largely dependent on
their law-relevant personal morals (internalized rules of conduct, including supporting
moral emotions such as shame and guilt) and their ability to exercise self-control (the
ability to withstand external pressure to act against one's own personal morals).4 The
closer a person's personal morals correspond to specific rules of conduct stated in the
law, the less prone he or she is to violate these rules. The stronger a person's ability to
exercise self-control, the less likely he or she is to be enticed to act contrary to his or her
own personal morals. SAT predicts, at one extreme, that people with strong law-relevant
personal morals and a strong ability to exercise self-control are largely resistant to
momentary criminogenic influences of settings, whereas at the other extreme those who
have weak law-relevant personal morals and a poor ability to exercise self-control are
vulnerable to momentary influences of criminogenic settings.5
The theory proposes that the criminogenic features of a setting (the immediate envi-
ronment a person at any given time can experience with his or her senses) is largely
dependent on its (perceived) law-relevant moral context (the moral norms and their
enforcement relevant to the motivations ­ temptations and provocations ­ people may
experience in the setting). Settings (places) are criminogenic to the extent that
Figure 1. The relationship between person, setting and situation illustrated.
14 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
their (perceived) moral norms,6 and their level of enforcement, encourage (or do not
discourage) acts of crime in response to the opportunities they provide and/or the fric-
tions they create.7
The PEA hypothesis
The situational model of SAT is captured in the PEA hypothesis (for example, Wikström,
2014): for any particular motivation (temptation or provocation), the resulting action
(A), for example an act that constitutes a crime, is an outcome of a perception­choice
process () that results from the interaction (×) between relevant personal propensities
(P) and exposure to relevant setting inducements (E).
P × E  A
Motivation is a situational concept. SAT defines motivation as `goal-directed attention'
and asserts that there are two main kinds of motivators: temptations and provocations.8
Temptations arise when there is an opportunity to satisfy a desire or to fulfil a commitment.
Provocations occur when a friction (an unwanted external interference) causes anger or
annoyance towards the perceived source of the friction or a substitute (see, further,
Wikström, 2014: 79). The perception­choice process () is crucial for understanding a
person's actions. Perception (the selective information we get from our senses) is what
links a person to his or her environment, and choice (the formation of an intention to act in
one way or another) is what links a person to his or her actions (see, further, Wikström,
2006: 76­84). The perception­choice process may be more or less automated (determinis-
tic) ­ ranging from a fully habitual to a more reasoned process ­ depending on the circum-
stances (see, further, Wikström, 2006: 97­9; Wikström, 2014: 80­2; Treiber, 2011). The
perception­choice process is most likely to be of a habitual nature when people operate in
familiar circumstances with congruent rule-guidance (or are under high levels of stress or
emotion) and most likely to involve reasoning when people operate in unfamiliar circum-
stances or circumstances with conflicting potent rule-guidance. SAT asserts that acts of
crime are most likely to happen (being seen and chosen as an acceptable action alternative)
when a crime-prone person responds (habitually or deliberatively) to a potent motivator
(temptation or provocation) in a criminogenic setting.
According to SAT, changes in people's actions (including their acts of crime) are a
result of changes in their personal propensities and/or environmental exposure because
such changes affect the input to the perception­choice process that guides people's action
choices (Wikström and Treiber, 2018).
Key issues in testing the core situational hypothesis of SAT
Based on the more general PEA hypothesis, the main proposition to be tested in this paper
is that young people are differentially vulnerable to criminogenic exposure depending on
their crime propensity. More specifically we hypothesize that young people with a low
crime propensity are largely immune to criminogenic exposure whereas young people
with a high crime propensity are increasingly vulnerable to criminogenic exposure.
Wikström et al. 15
Measuring spatio-temporal interaction effects
A crucial test of our hypothesis is whether acts of crime are predicted by the spatio-
temporal interaction between people's crime propensity and criminogenic exposure.
Interaction effects are usually estimated in statistical analysis by studying how the effect
of one independent variable (for example criminogenic exposure) on the outcome vari-
able (for example crime involvement) depends on the magnitude of another independent
variable (for example crime propensity). Typically the data used in such studies (for
example questionnaire data) refer to different scales (for example, one scale measuring
criminogenic exposure, one scale measuring crime propensity and one scale measuring
crime involvement) that are spatio-temporally unconnected. This is not unproblematic
because, even if such a study shows a strong statistical interaction effect (for example,
that time spent in criminogenic settings is predictive of the crime frequency only for
those with a higher crime propensity), it does not conclusively demonstrate that acts of
crime are actually most likely to happen when crime-prone people are in criminogenic
settings (because there is no spatio-temporal link in the data between being in a crimino-
genic setting and committing an act of crime).
Arguably, the ultimate (correct) test of our interactional hypothesis requires exploring
whether the elements of propensity, exposure and crime converge in time and space. In
other words, do crime-prone people tend to commit acts of crime when they are in crimi-
nogenic settings? To properly test this assumption we need data that locate particular
people in particular settings at particular times and tell us whether or not they committed
acts of crime in those particular settings at those particular times. The unique space­time
budget methodology used in PADS+ helps us achieve this (see further the section on
Data and measurements below).
Crime causation ­ A question of minutes rather than years
SAT asserts that the causes of action, such as acts of crime, are situational. It is the com-
bination of a particular person in a particular setting that triggers (and guides) a percep-
tion­choice process that, depending on the input, may or may not encourage an act of
crime.9 Importantly, there is no causal ordering between propensity and exposure because
it is their specific blend that initiates (and guides) the perception­choice process respon-
sible for what action is taken (Figure 2). The causal time-ordering is thus between the
interaction (`the trigger') and the action (`the outcome'). This is allegedly normally a
process of minutes (or in some instances even seconds). The main methodological impli-
cation of this is that ideally we should aim to have data (measurements) of people's
propensity, exposure and crimes that are as close as possible in time ­ preferably meas-
ured concurrently.
The importance of time-ordering the `cause' and the `effect' is often stressed as a key
element in testing causal hypotheses. However, time-ordering between cause and effect
is only one necessary but far from sufficient criterion for causation.10 The often voiced
opinion that longitudinal studies are (always) better than cross-sectional studies when the
researcher aims to address questions of causation is highly misguided when examining
situational factors because longitudinal data are typically collected on an annual basis. It
16 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
is hardly an advantage to have annually time-ordered data when exploring situational
factors and processes; in fact, cross-sectional data are more apt. It would, of course, be
advantageous if the trigger­outcome (interaction­action) sequence could be time-
ordered, but very few research designs and existing data (including ours) make time-
ordering of interaction and action in terms of minutes possible. In practice, therefore, the
(second-)best option when studying situational factors and processes is to aim to meas-
ure propensity, exposure and crime as close as possible in time (and make the reasonable
assumption that the `interaction' produces the `action' rather than the other way around).
Space­time budget methodology helps us spatio-temporally link crime propensity, crim-
inogenic exposure and acts of crime.
Beyond neighbourhoods ­ Measuring settings and exposure
SAT proposes that only the part of the environment (`the setting') that a person experi-
ences with his or her senses can influence his or her perception of action alternatives and
choices. Exploring the person­environment interaction therefore requires that we have
measures of settings (immediate environments) that approximate as closely as possible
the part of the environment that a person in a location is likely to directly experience. The
aim should be to collect environmental data about the smallest possible geographical
units (see, further, Oberwittler and Wikström, 2009). Moreover, since people are not
stationary but move around in space, we need a methodology that can also account for
their activity fields, that is, their exposure to different settings (environments) during the
study period. Even if people live in the same house and belong to the same family, they
may, depending on their specific way of life, have a widely varying exposure to particu-
lar environments ­ for example criminogenic settings ­ within and outside their neigh-
bourhood (see, for example, Wikström et al., 2012b: 68).
Most existing studies of the role of the environment and the person­environment
interaction in crime causation are based on large (and therefore typically environmen-
tally heterogeneous) geographical areas, and usually the person's environment is repre-
sented only by the area surrounding his or her residence (`the neighbourhood'). In
practice these are therefore studies of how the interaction between people's characteris-
tics and their neighbourhood characteristics predict their crime involvement (ignoring
the wider environment in which a person operates), and usually the data on environments

and crime commission are not spatio-temporally linked (for examples, see Simcha-Fagan
and Schwartz, 1986; Simons et al., 2014; Wikström and Loeber, 2000). Space­time
budget methodology combined with a small area community survey helps us to over-
come these problems and advance towards the goal of better measuring the environmen-
tal features of settings and people's activity fields (that is, their specific configuration of
exposure to different kinds of settings).
Data and measurements
The data for this study are taken from the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult
Development Study (PADS+). This is an ongoing longitudinal study of a cohort of 716
randomly selected boys and girls from the UK city of Peterborough who turned 12 in
2003. The study has so far completed nine waves of data collection. The first wave con-
sisted of one-to-one interviews with each participant's main care-giver (parent) and the
subsequent eight waves consisted of data collection conducted with the participants
themselves via one-to-one psychometric tests and space­time budgets, and interviewer-
led small group questionnaires. In addition, a range of official records (for example
police records and census data) have been collected for the participants and for geo-
graphical areas in Peterborough, and two special small area community surveys have
been carried out (in 2005 and 2012) with random samples of the Peterborough popula-
tion aged 18 and older for each output area in the city (output areas are small geographi-
cal areas with, on average, 300 residents).11 For detailed information about the study
design, its data and measurements, see Wikström et al. (2012b: 44­106). The data ana-
lysed in this paper refer only to Phase 1 of the PADS+ data collection. Phase 1 focuses
on adolescence and consists of annually collected data covering the ages 13­17 (the
years in which the participants turned 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17). The retention rate of the
study is very high and at age 17 (wave 6) 97 percent of the initial sample still took part.
Space­time budgets
The space­time budget methodology is the basis for the spatio-temporal matching of
data about people (crime propensities), settings (criminogenic features) and actions
(crime).12 The space­time budget places a person in a setting (output area) at a specific
hour and thereby directly links the person to the setting spatio-temporally. The space­
time budget also collects data about the circumstances in which he or she takes part in
the setting (for example, with whom and doing what) and data about whether or not he
or she committed an act of crime when in the setting (thereby directly linking acts of
crime and settings spatio-temporally). For details of the space­time budget and its cod-
ing, see Wikström et al. (2012b: 67­78, 423­36 and technical appendix A2).
Small area community survey
Space­time budgets thus allow us to analyse on an hourly basis where young people
were (at what geographical locations), in what circumstances (for example, doing what
with whom) and whether or not they committed an act of crime. However, they do not
18 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
provide data about the wider moral context (for example, the output area's level of col-
lective efficacy) in which young people encounter particular circumstances (for exam-
ple, socialize unsupervised with peers). The space­time budget data have therefore been
complemented with relevant environmental data from a specially designed small area
community survey carried out by the PADS+ research team by a postal survey in the year
2005 (for details, see Wikström et al., 2012a).
The city of Peterborough was (in 2005) divided into 518 output areas (with an average
of 125 households). A random sample was drawn from the electoral register of people
aged 18 or older for each output area to ensure sufficient data for each of the 518 output
areas. It was judged that having a minimum of 10 respondents in each area would be suf-
ficient to achieve reliable measures of output area collective features (for further details
about and tests of the validity of this argument, see Oberwittler and Wikström, 2009 ­ see
also Snijders and Bosker, 1999). The average number of respondents per output area was
13. In total, 6615 people participated in the 2005 small area community survey, repre-
senting an overall response rate of 53 percent (for more details about the small area com-
munity survey, its design, reliability and validity, and the content of the questionnaire,
see Wikström et al., 2012b: 87­104). The data from the small area community survey are
directly linked spatially to the space­time budget at the output area level. However, in
contrast to the space­time budget, there is no temporal dimension of the small area com-
munity survey.
Collective efficacy is a concept that combines residents' social cohesion and their
informal social control potential and aims to measure residents' willingness to intervene
for the common good, such as to prevent disorder and crime (Sampson et al., 1997). We
selected collective efficacy as our prime measure of the moral context of a setting because
it is an established and tested measure (for example, Duncan et al., 2003; Sampson and
Wikström, 2008) with a focus on the level of residents' enforcement of key common
rules of conduct relevant to young people. We used the original questions suggested by
Sampson et al. (1997) with one modification.13 The Cronbach's alpha of the combined
scales was a highly satisfactory .87. The measure was scaled so that high values meant
poor collective efficacy (that is, low social cohesion and weak informal social control).
As recommended by Sampson et al. (1997), the scale we use to classify output area lev-
els of poor collective efficacy is an empirical Bayes estimate adjusted for individual-
level socio-demographic composition (for details, see Wikström et al., 2012b: 143­6).
Land-use data
One limitation of the 2005 small area community survey data is that it is largely restricted
to residents' generalized observations of other residents' relationships and behaviour.
Social life and controls in urban areas are determined not only by residents but also by
the quantity and characteristics of temporary populations (visitors) that frequent the area
and their activities. One kind of urban area that tends to have particularly high levels of
visitors and non-residential activities (for example commerce and entertainment) is city
and local centres, and because such features are an important aspect of area social life
and control we decided to classify, based on land-use data, whether or not an output area
was a city or local centre area. As is the case for the small area community survey, these
Wikström et al. 19
data are spatially linked to the other data but lack a temporal dimension (that is, data
about day and hourly variations). We make the assumption that these data satisfactorily
represent the relevant impact of visitors and non-residential activities on the social life
and control in the output area (although we are aware, of course, that centre area activi-
ties tend to be very different at different times of the day, being focused on commerce
during the day and on entertainment at night).
The measure of criminogenic settings
Space­time budget data, complemented with data from the small area community survey
and land-use data, provide information about what kinds of settings (circumstances and
their moral context) a person has taken part in during the studied periods and their acts
of crime.14 The criteria in this study for a setting to qualify as criminogenic for young
people are that the output area is an area with poor collective efficacy (defined as belong-
ing to the output areas with the 25 percent highest scores of poor collective efficacy) or
a city or local centre area and the young person taking part in the setting is engaged in
unstructured and unsupervised activities with peers.
Questionnaires ­ Measuring crime propensity
To explore the interaction between personal propensity and setting exposure as causes of
acts of crime, data about the participants'crime propensity need to be added. To measure
people's crime propensity we use an index that combines standardized values (Z-scores)
from a scale of generalized personal morals (for details, see Wikström et al., 2012b:
132­5) and a scale of generalized ability to exercise self-control (for details, see Wikström
et al., 2012b: 135­7).15 Previous reviews of research have demonstrated that personal
morals (for example, Stams et al., 2006) and ability to exercise self-control (for example,
Pratt and Cullen, 2000) are indeed strong predictors of crime involvement.
As previously argued, data about people's crime propensity should be collected as
close as possible in time to the data about setting exposure and crime commission. The
data about the participants' personal morals and abilities to exercise self-control are
taken from scales measured on the same occasion as the space­time budget data.16 When
exploring the person­setting interactions, we matched the 2003 data on participants'
crime propensity with the 2003 space­time budget data, the 2004 data on participants'
crime propensity with the 2004 space­time budget data, and so forth, to make sure that
the measurement of people's crime propensity was temporally linked as closely as pos-
sible to the measurement of their criminogenic exposure and crimes. This also means
that any age-related (annual) changes over the study period (ages 13 to 17) in a partici-
pant's crime propensity were taken into account when analysing the person­exposure
interaction.
Analytic strategy
To explore how young people's crime propensity and the proposed criminogenic factors
of the environment, in combination, can predict acts of crime, we will use an artificial
20 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
neural network modelling approach. We will first test the predictive power of crime pro-
pensity and the elements making up criminogenic exposure and, then, test the PEA
hypothesis by studying how the influence of criminogenic exposure (exposure vs. non-
exposure) during a particular hour affects the probability of crime in that same hour for
young people with different levels of crime propensity. Finally, and based on the out-
come of the analysis of the propensity­exposure interaction, we will estimate the impact
of (hypothetical) successful reductions in crime propensity and criminogenic exposure
for young people's crime involvement.
Artificial neural network modelling
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly flexible tools for performing non-linear
regression and classification (for example, Bishop, 2009) that so far have had a rather
limited application in criminological studies (for example, Olligschlaeger, 1997). An
ANN specifies a mapping between input and output variables of interest; here the inputs
are the various factors hypothesized to contribute to the commission of acts of crime,
and the output is the probability that a crime is committed in a particular hour. We will
select the optimal model ­ the set of factors that have the greatest predictive power ­ via
cross-validation. That is, we will randomly split the original data set into two parts, the
training data, which are used to fit the model and estimate its parameters, and the test
data, which we aim to predict using the fitted model. Each ANN uses a specific set of
included factors as the predictors of crime probability per hour. The ANN was cross-
validated by training on 50 percent of the available data, with 50 percent withheld for
cross-validation.
A model predicts the probability that a crime will be committed, based on the availa-
ble information provided by the test input. To evaluate the quality of this prediction
against the actual crimes in the test output data, we will use the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC), a canonical test for the predictive power of a binary classifier (Brown
and Davis, 2006; Green and Swets, 1966). Setting a threshold probability, and declaring
that once this probability is reached we will predict that a crime will be committed, we
can test how many true positives (correct identifications of crimes) versus false positives
(predictions of crimes when none occurred) the model produces. Varying this threshold
alters the balance between true positives and false positives, producing a characteristic
curve, the ROC, which shows how the rate of true positives varies with the rate of false
positives. The procedure was repeated 10 times with different subsets of the data with-
held or used for training to determine the average performance of the ANN.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a single number that quantifies the perfor-
mance of the classifier. An AUC of 1 indicates that all true positives are identified with-
out any false positives, that is the classifier is perfect. Conversely, anAUC of 0.5 indicates
the performance characteristic of a random classifier, that is the classifier is useless. The
higher the AUC produced by a model the greater its predictive power.
ANNs that show high predictive power (AUCs) are associated with important factors
in predicting the outcome (in our case, the occurrence of crime). The cross-validation
method, focusing on the ability to predict data previously unseen by the ANN, identifies
models that generalize well and thus avoids overfitting problems common to regression
Wikström et al. 21
methods. Thus we can attribute increased predictive performance to identifying factors
that genuinely affect the probability that an individual will commit a crime.
Factors are selected in a `greedy' manner through an iterative process that tries each
element on its own, then fixes the most important, then tries all the others next, and fixes
the next most important, and so on. That is, all possible one-factor ANNs are tested, and
the best performing is selected. This factor is then included in all future ANNs.
Subsequently all combinations of the best single factor and one other factor are tested to
find the best two factors, which are subsequently included in all future ANNs, and so
forth, until all factors have been included.
The collected data have a time-series structure, being the recorded movements and
activities of individuals for each hour over four separate days each year (190,508 total
waking hours for analysis, including 125 crime hours). As such, temporal correlations
in the data can be expected to be significant and potentially introduce artefacts such
as pseudo-replication into our analysis. To account for the time-series nature of the
data we always include an autoregressive (AR) component in our models, which con-
trols for the possibility that observed crimes are continuations of those that were initi-
ated in the previous hour (this was actually the case for 10 crime hours). The predictive
models are generated as combinations of the other included factors (Table 1). In addi-
tion to AR and the proposed causally effective factors (crime propensity and the ele-
ments of criminogenic exposure), we also included day of week (D) and time of day
(T) as `controls'. The rationale for this is that the variables measuring the moral
context (collective efficacy, city and local centres) lack a temporal dimension (if our
variables are sufficient to measure exposure then we would expect day and hour to
have no residual predictive power). With the AR factor fixed as an element of the
model, and with eight remaining `free' factors, we can generate 28, that is 256, pos-
sible models, though our `greedy' selection algorithm reduces the number of models
tested to a more manageable 36.17 In each case the output remains the same ­ the
occurrences of crime ­ but the inputs are chosen by which factors are included in each
model.

Findings
The predictive power of crime propensity and elements of criminogenic
exposure
To test the predictive power of crime propensity and the elements making up crimino-
genic exposure we assessed the value of each factor by using the area under the ROC
(AUC) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a series of ANNs. The value of the AUCs
may be interpreted in the following way: If we take a random pair of hours, one of which
contains crime and one of which doesn't, AUC is the probability that we assign a higher
probability of a crime to the hour `with'crime than the one `without'crime based on the
included predictors.
Our findings show a number of clear facets (Figure 3). Crime propensity (PS) is
selected first, and has the bulk of the predictive power. Subsequently all the elements that
constitute our proposed exposure variable are selected, with an initial substantial increase
in predictive power for being unsupervised (US) and a subsequent plateau without any
significant drop in prediction for any of the additional elements (PPP, LC, CC, USt, CE)
that constitute our measure of criminogenic exposure.

Figure 4. Probability of crime per waking hour with and without criminogenic exposure by
crime propensity.
The findings support the use of our proposed criminogenic exposure variable (that is,
taking part in unsupervised and unstructured activities with peers in a place of poor col-
lective efficacy or in the city or a local centre) as a measure of the criminogenic exposure
of a setting. Day of the week (D) and time of day (T), which were included as controls,
lead to initially small (D), then large (T) significant decreases in predictive power (con-
fidence intervals for day and time shown in Figure 3). This is evidence of overfitting, and
suggests that, once crime propensity and criminogenic features of the setting (moral
context and circumstances) are accounted for, day and time have no predictive value and
that the included elements of criminogenic exposure pick up the day and time variations
in crime (consequent on the view that they are markers of criminogenic features rather
than factors with any causal efficacy). All in all, our measures of crime propensity and
criminogenic exposure are strong predictors of the probability of committing acts of
crime in a given hour.
The interaction between crime propensity and criminogenic exposure in
predicting the probability of crime in a particular hour
Having established the efficacy of the elements of the criminogenic exposure varia-
ble, alongside the predictive power of crime propensity, we now train an ANN on two
factors, using 100 percent of the data: crime propensity and the composite crimino-
genic exposure variable (that is, unsupervised with peers taking part in unstructured
activities in a residential area with poor collective efficacy or in the city or a local
centre). We use this to calculate directly the probability that an individual with a
given crime propensity will commit an act of crime when exposed or not. To do this
we feed the trained ANN with a range of values of (standardized) crime propensity
from -3 to 3 and of criminogenic exposure with a value of 1 or 0 (exposed vs non-
exposed). The predicted crime probabilities (that is, the probability that a crime will
occur in a particular hour) by level of crime propensity are plotted for hours crimino-
genically exposed versus unexposed in Figure 4.
24 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
This result shows several crucial features. Firstly, the probability of committing a
crime is strongly, and non-linearly, related to crime propensity (the shaded areas in
Figure 4 indicate the 95% confidence intervals). Young people with a high crime propen-
sity commit a disproportionate number of crimes. Even within the group with a high
crime propensity (PS > 1), those with the highest propensity are committing a much
larger number of crimes per hour than their high propensity peers. Secondly, exposure to
criminogenic settings results in a substantial increase in crime probability. This increase
is, in absolute terms, much higher for those with a high crime propensity. Therefore
crimes are disproportionately committed by high crime propensity people in crimino-
genic settings. Thirdly, while the estimated probability of committing a crime for young
people with a low crime propensity is also higher when in a criminogenic setting, the
difference in absolute terms for these young people is negligible (the difference is not
statistically significant when crime propensity is less than -1.5, as indicated by the fact
that the confidence intervals overlap). Our findings thus give strong support for the PEA
hypothesis: acts of crime are most likely when crime-prone young people take part in
criminogenic settings.18 Moreover, our findings specify this relationship: the higher a
young person's crime propensity the stronger the influence of criminogenic exposure on
his or her probability of committing an act of crime. The interaction of people and places
clearly matters in crime causation.
A note on the potential problem of `floor effects'
Our interactional analysis is based on modelling 125 crime events across about 190,000
hours. This fact may cause some colleagues to worry whether our findings are largely a
result of the distribution of the crime variable and reflect only a (so-called) floor effect
(for example, Osgood, 2002: 337­40). However, there is no floor effect inherent in our
classification methodology. Our neural network predicts the probability that a crime will
occur or not within a single hour ­ a binary variable. This is fitted by maximizing the
likelihood of the observed crime/no crime events in the observed hours based on the
parameters of the neural network (via back-propagation, a gradient descent algorithm for
neural networks ­ see Rumelhart et al., 1986), not via any least-squares method or
similar.
Our evidence for an interaction effect is simply that the probability of crime rises with
crime propensity, as shown in Figure 4, but that it is always higher when there is (stronger)
criminogenic exposure. Since the two curves in Figure 4 are not separated by a constant,
but instead exhibit a roughly constant ratio, this is most parsimoniously explained by
criminogenic exposure and crime propensity interacting ­ rather than just summing, as
per the standard linear model.
Changes in crime as a result of changes in crime propensity and
criminogenic exposure
According to SAT, to change people's crime one can either change people's crime pro-
pensities or their criminogenic exposure19 (or both) because such changes alter the per-
son­environment interaction, which is the input to the perception­choice process that
Wikström et al. 25
affects whether or not a person is likely to see and choose an act of crime as an action
alternative in response to potent motivators (Figure 2). For illustrative purposes we have
calculated how much reduction in crimes per 1000 hours would result if one succeeded
in reducing all young people's crime propensity, or all young people's criminogenic
exposure, by 1 standard deviation (STD) (Table 2). These calculations are based on the
relationships between crime propensity, criminogenic exposure and probabilities of
crime, as shown in Figure 4. The result suggests that successfully reducing young peo-
ple's crime propensity (as defined here) has a much greater effect on their crimes than
reducing their criminogenic exposure (as defined here), although both changes would
lead to reductions in crime.
Conclusions and discussion
In this paper we have advocated SAT as a theory that effectively integrates key insights
from people- and place-oriented criminological theory and research, and we have tested
its core situational hypothesis (the PEA hypothesis) using a unique set of data from the
Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+). The PADS+
data and methodologies are exceptionally suitable for conducting situational analysis
because they enable detailed spatio-temporal matching of people, places and acts of
crime, and provide in-depth data about the circumstances and environments in which
young people with different crime propensities take part (and commit acts of crime). In
the present study we have analysed more than 190,000 hours (time awake) of people
(propensities) and place (environmental inducements) convergences in adolescence
(ages 13 to 17).
SAT proposes that humans are essentially rule-guided actors and that the defining
feature of acts of crime is that they breach rules of conduct (stated in law) and, therefore,
law-relevant personal morals and the ability to exercise self-control are the key individ-
ual characteristics upon which a person's crime propensity is dependent. The findings
from our study strongly support this assertion by demonstrating that crime propensity
(measured as an index of law-relevant personal morals and the ability to exercise self-
control) strongly predicts the probability of committing an act of crime.
However, SAT also stresses that acts of crime are always an outcome of the interac-
tion between a person's crime propensity and his or her criminogenic exposure, where
criminogenic exposure is seen as dependent on the moral context of the setting and the
circumstances in which people take part in that context. Our findings show that our
measures of criminogenic exposure are strong predictors of the probability of crime

(which add substantially to the predictive power of crime propensity) and, importantly,
that the probability of crime is strongest when a crime-prone person (as defined here)
takes part in a criminogenic setting (as defined here). Crucially, we find that the higher a
young person's crime propensity the more vulnerable he or she is to influences from
criminogenic exposure.
Although our study provides a methodologically and statistically rigorous test of and
supports the interactional hypothesis of SAT, it does not examine the proposed action
mechanism: the presumed perception­choice process that links the person­environment
interaction (the trigger) to the action (the outcome). However, previous research from
PADS+ using randomized scenarios regarding the intended use of violence (varying by
levels of provocation and supervision) lends some support to this assumption, showing
that those with a high crime propensity (measured in the same way as in this study) were
more likely to choose a violent response (especially at lower levels of provocation) than
those with a low crime propensity (Wikström et al., 2012b: 364­402).
The fact that crime propensity is a stronger predictor of the probability of crime than
criminogenic exposure (Figure 3), and that successful reductions in crime propensity
seemingly lead to larger reductions in crime than successful reductions in criminogenic
exposure (Table 2), is not unexpected since (as our findings show) criminogenic expo-
sure largely affects the probability of crime for those with some level of crime propen-
sity, and particularly (and increasingly) for those with a high crime propensity, whereas
it has little or no impact on those with a low crime propensity.
Our results suggest which key personal and environmental factors are implicated in
crime causation and, therefore, which factors should be the prime target for crime pre-
vention policy and intervention. However, our findings say nothing about which are the
most effective policies and interventions to affect people's crime propensities and crimi-
nogenic exposures. They only suggest that if we can devise successful policies and inter-
vention to affect people's crime propensities (by influencing their law-relevant personal
morals and abilities to exercise self-control), and successful policies and interventions to
affect people's criminogenic exposure (by influencing the law-relevant moral norms of a
setting and their enforcement and/or people's access to criminogenic settings), policies
and intervention that successfully reduce people's crime propensity would most likely be
the more effective.20
In this paper the focus has been on situational analysis. Situational analysis explains
why crime happens; it specifies the interactions and action mechanisms involved and
tells us what moves people to action (what causes action) and what factors are important
in that process. However it does not tell us much about how particular criminogenic situ-
ations (interactions) come about and what (cultural and structural) factors and processes
are important in this respect. SAT suggests that this is fundamentally a question of how
processes of selection (contemporaneous processes of rules- and resource-based social
selection, and agency-based self-selection within the constraints of social selection) cre-
ate criminogenic person­environment interactions (Wikström, 2014: 84).
Moreover, situational analysis does not tell us why people develop different crime
propensities (dependent on their law-relevant personal morals and abilities to exercise
self-control), and why places come to vary in their criminogeneity (dependent on their
law-relevant moral norms and their enforcement). SAT suggests that this is largely a
Wikström et al. 27
question of emergence (that is, the process by which something becomes as it is). SAT
asserts that people's crime propensities are largely an outcome of psycho-social pro-
cesses of person emergence, particularly processes of moral education and cognitive
nurturing of relevance to people's law-relevant personal morals and abilities to exercise
self-control (Wikström and Treiber, 2018). SAT further suggests that the criminogeneity
of a place is largely an outcome of socio-ecological processes of social emergence, par-
ticularly processes of population and activity spatial and temporal differentiation that are
of relevance to (time and) place-based law-relevant moral norms and their enforcement
(see, further, Wikström, 2011).
Situational analysis is arguably the core of the study of crime and its causes. However, to
give a comprehensive account of the question of crime causation, situational analysis needs
to be complemented with analyses and investigations of how (as the `causes of the causes'21)
contemporaneous processes of social and self-selection and past processes of social and
person emergence are implicated in the creation of the situations that cause acts of crime.

Notes
 1. Criminological theories rarely specify a theory of action (a theory about what moves people
to action). When they do, they typically allude to some version of rational choice theory
(RCT). However, we do not believe that RCT is a fruitful or satisfactory basis for integrating
people- and place-oriented insights about crime causation (for a discussion, see Wikström and
Treiber, 2016).
 2. See, for example, Hirschi (1969), social bonds; Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990), self-control;
Felson (2008), routine activity; Cornish and Clarke (2008), rational choice.
3. Further on this argument, see, for example, Wikström and Treiber (2007), re. self-control
theory; and Wikström and Treiber (2016), re. opportunity theory, that is, routine activity and
RCT.
 4. Please note that SAT's conceptualization of self-control differs from that in Gottfredson and
Hirschi's (1990) General Theory of Crime (for a discussion, see Wikström and Treiber, 2007).
SAT carefully distinguishes between (i) the ability to exercise self-control and (ii) exercising
self-control. The former is an individual characteristic; the latter a person's active manage-
ment of a situation.
 5. It should be stressed that SAT acknowledges that people's crime propensity may vary signifi-
cantly depending on the type of crime in question. To adequately study the causes of specific
crimes (rule-breakings) one needs to study the specific propensities and exposures that may
trigger and guide actions that break that particular rule of conduct.
28 European Journal of Criminology 15(1)
 6. The concepts of `place' and `setting' are closely related and overlapping. According to SAT,
the difference is that `place' refers to a specific location in time and space and its immediate
environment (objects, people, events), whereas `setting' refers to the part of the immediate
environment a person in a specific location experiences with his or her senses.
 7. If a setting has a (perceived) high level of enforcement of moral norms promoting acts of
crime in response to its particular opportunities or frictions, this enforcement is criminogenic.
 8. Motivation is the reason for action. However, people commit particular acts of crime for all
kinds of reasons.
 9. SAT applies a `soft' version of causality by acknowledging that there are elements of deter-
mination (habit) and `free will' (deliberation) in the process when people make choices,
although SAT insists that `free will' is always exercised within the constraints of the action
alternatives perceived (see, further, Wikström, 2006, 2014).
10. Causation implies a regularly occurring (asymmetric) association between time-ordered var-
iables that holds universally (or at least in a specific context or in certain circumstances) and
that makes it possible to predict one (the effect) from the other (the cause). However, the idea
of causation is not only the idea of a regular association (and the possibility of prediction)
but, crucially, also the idea that the cause in some way produces the effect through a causal
process that links the cause to the effect (see, for example, Bunge, 2004; Psillos, 2002).
11. The neighbourhood units in criminological studies typically have average population sizes
in the range of 4000­8000 people (for examples, see Bellair, 1997; Sampson et al., 1997;
Sampson and Wikström, 2008; Smith and McVie, 2003; Wikström and Loeber, 2000).
12. The space­time budget methodology was first used in criminology in the Peterborough Youth
Study (Wikström and Butterworth, 2006), a cross-sectional forerunner to PADS+, in which
the technique was piloted and later refined for inclusion in PADS+.
13. We dropped one item asking about the residents' likelihood to intervene if a local fire station
was threatened with budget cuts from the original informal control scale because it signifi-
cantly reduced the scale's internal consistency.
14. Which particular circumstances help make a setting criminogenic may depend on the specific
age(s) and/or type(s) of crime under study.
15. Each scale was standardized over the five included years (ages). The self-control scale is a
modified version of the Grasmick et al. (1993) scale, and the scale of law-relevant morality is
largely based on a scale from the Pittsburgh Youth Study.
16. The space­time budget data refer to the days immediately preceding the time of the data col-
lection. There is no reason to believe that people's crime propensities (based on their personal
morals and ability to exercise self-control) will display any significant change over such a
short period of time (other than in very extreme cases). The annual correlations of the index
of crime propensity for the five included years varies between 0.69 and 0.76 (Wikström et al.,
2012b: 138).
17. The algorithm reduces the number of models tested to 36 by selecting each factor iteratively.
Hence, for example, we investigate only two factor models that include auto-regression, the
factor selected for a single factor model. Likewise, our search over three factor models covers
only those models incorporating both auto-regression and individual propensity, and so on.
This means that we search over 8 + 7 + ... 1 = 36 models in total, as the number of remaining
factors to be selected from at each stage decreases by one.
18. There is also an increase in absolute terms in the probability of crime by level of crime
propensity for settings classified as `other' but not as dramatic as for those defined as crimi-
nogenic (please recall that our classification of a criminogenic setting is rather conservative
and that the settings classified as `other' may included several of the criminogenic elements
jointly defining a criminogenic setting).
Wikström et al. 29
19. Reductions in criminogenic exposure can be accomplished either by interventions reducing
the criminogeneity of the settings a person takes part in and/or by interventions that limit his
or her access to such settings (places).The latter is accomplished mainly by influencing pro-
cesses of social and self-selection (or through incapacitation).
20. Developmentally, exposure and propensity are not unrelated, with, for example, the implica-
tion that, in the longer term, policies and interventions targeting exposure may also affect
people's crime propensities.
21. Causes of the causes are causally effective factors and processes further back in a causal
chain, for example factors and processes that form and shape a person's crime propensities
(see Wikström, 2011).
