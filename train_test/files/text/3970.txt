Abstract
Objective: To analyse the role of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels in the
differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods: This case­control study analysed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients
with RA and healthy control subjects. The diagnostic ability of COMP for RA was evaluated by
comparing it with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody levels. The sensitivity, specificity,
positive and negative predictive values were calculated.
Results: The study enrolled 82 patients with RA and 34 healthy control subjects. The serum
COMP level was significantly higher in patients with RA compared with control subjects
(mean Æ SD 29.51 Æ 9.21 ng/ml versus 17.85 Æ 5.55 ng/ml, respectively). The serum COMP level
was significantly higher in patients with active RA compared with patients with RA in remission
(mean Æ SD 33.08 Æ 8.80 ng/ml versus 24.94 Æ 7.65 ng/ml, respectively). The cut-off value for
COMP to discriminate patients with RA from healthy individuals was 21.51 ng/ml (sensitivity 0.817,
specificity 0.882, positive predictive value 0.944, negative predictive value 0.667, and accuracy
0.836).
Conclusion: The serum COMP level has the potential to be used as a biological marker for
differentiating between patients with RA and healthy individuals.

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex,
chronic autoimmune inflammatory joint
disease that is characterized by progressive
erosive symmetrical joint destruction and
systemic extra-articular manifestations,
affecting approximately 0.5%­1.0% of the
adult population worldwide.1 Research has
shown that the most significant characteris-
tic of RA is proliferative and inflammatory
synovitis of the peripheral joints, which is
accompanied by progressive and irreversible
damage to the articular cartilage and bone
that may cause joint deformity and disabil-
ity.2,3 It is very important that diagnosis and
treatment are initiated in the early stages of
RA, because this has been shown to be very
valuable in slowing down progression of
the disease.4,5 Currently, the diagnosis and
staging of patients with RA is mainly based
on the clinical symptoms, imaging results
and some traditional laboratory tests.6,7
These methods are often used to diagnose
RA during the middle-to-late disease period
when treatment is not able to effectively
control the progressive articular and bone
damage caused by the disease.8 Research has
confirmed that some biological markers
reflecting cartilage degradation provide the
possibility of early diagnosis.7 Biomarkers
may serve a wide range of purposes in
clinical practice, but biomarker research
must be the subject of a quantitative surro-
gate validation schema to ensure clinical and
statistical validity.9,10
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein
(COMP), a cartilage-derived marker of car-
tilage breakdown, is a prognostic factor
in early RA.7,11,12 It can be detected in
biological fluids, including synovial fluid
and serum in patients with RA and other
diseases, such as osteoarthritis and articular
trauma.7 COMP is an extracellular matrix
protein mainly localized to tendon, cartil-
age, and pericartilage tissues.13 During RA
progression, the pathophysiological pro-
cesses involve the digestion and dissolution
of the intercellular components of the con-
nective tissue by protease-derived hydroly-
sis.14 Inflammatory synovium has been
considered as a potential tissue source of
COMP since the molecule has been detected
in the synovium in both RA and osteoarth-
ritis.15­18 A study concluded that serum
COMP was a novel indicator for the diag-
nosis of early RA and a promising tool
to identify patients with significant joint
damage.17 Some studies have demonstrated
that COMP has the potential to be a diag-
nostic and prognostic indicator, a marker of
the disease severity and a marker of the
effect of treatment.12,19
In contrast, there are opposing views
about both (i) the potential use of COMP
as a biological marker for RA diagnosis and
prognosis, and (ii) the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of COMP in early RA diagnosis,20­22
which highlight the need for a greater
understanding of the biological processes
involved in RA disease progression. It also
remains unknown as to whether there is an
optimal cut-off value for COMP that is able
to discriminate patients with RA from
healthy subjects, which would be a key
feature for standardizing the use of COMP
for the diagnosis of RA. This present case­
control study investigated the role of COMP
in the diagnosis of patients with RA by
comparing it with anti-cyclic citrullinated
peptide antibody (anti-CCP) level, which is
another laboratory marker that has been
shown to be valuable in the early diagnosis
and prognosis of RA.23,24
Patients and methods
Study participants
This case­control study enrolled consecutive
patients with RA, who satisfied the revised
criteria for RA recommended by the 2010
American College of Rheumatology,25
between January 2011 and February 2013
in the Department of Rheumatology and
Immunology, Weifang People's Hospital,
Liu et al. 941
Weifang City, Shandong Province, China.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i)
confirmed diagnosis of RA; (ii) RA routine
treatment nai¨ve; (iii) !18 years; (iv) willing-
ness to participate in the study; (v) resident
in Weifang City for >6 months; and (vi) lack
of osteoarthritis or any other inflammatory
articular diseases. The exclusion criteria
were as follows: (i) patients with osteoarth-
ritis, rheumatic arthritis, or gouty arthritis;
(ii) those who had received RA routine
treatment; (iii) <18 years; (iv) resident in
Weifang City 6 months; (v) did not agree
to participate in the study; (vi) suffered from
a severe form of the disease or other
severe diseases and could not participate in
the study.
The healthy control subjects were recruited
from the Health Evaluation Clinic of Weifang
People's Hospital during the same study
period. They were healthy subjects with no
history of rheumatic disease or autoimmune
disease, no other history of infectious or
chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases
and they were unrelated to the patients. They
were matched to the patients with RA based
on sex and age ( Æ2 years).
The study protocol was approved by the
Ethical Committee of Weifang People's
Hospital (no. WRYL11016). Participants
were interviewed and informed of the
nature of the study. Each study participant,
or their legal representative, provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Physical examinations and laboratory tests
All study participants underwent a routine
medical history and physical examination,
which were undertaken by three Associate
Chief Physicians (F.L., X.W. & X.Z.) under
the supervision of an independent rheuma-
tologist in the Department of Rheumatology
and Immunology, Weifang People's Hospital.
The patients' age, disease duration, the dur-
ation of morning stiffness, joint tenderness
index, joint swelling index, joint activity pain
index, and joint resting pain index were
recorded.26 X-rays of the hands were under-
taken using an Axiom Aristos VX Plus digital
radiography system (Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) in order to identify the extent of
joint bone damage so that the stage of the
disease could be recorded. The stages of joint
bone damage were defined as follows (where *
identifies items that are necessary for classifi-
cation):27,28 stage I (early stage) includes (i) no
abnormal change on X-ray examination and
(ii) visible osteoporosis under the joint sur-
face; stage II (interim stage) includes *(i)
regional osteoporosis, with mild cartilage
damage, with or without mild subchondral
bone destruction, *(ii) visible restricted joint
activities with no joint deformities, (iii) adja-
cent muscle atrophy, and (iv) abarticular soft
tissue lesions, e.g. nodules and tenosynovitis;
stage III (severe stage) includes *(i) osteopor-
osis, bone and cartilage destruction, *(ii) joint
deformities, such as subluxation, feet lateral
deflection, with no joint stiffness, (iii) a wide
range of muscle atrophy, and (iv) abarticular
soft tissue lesions with nodules and tenosyno-
vitis; and stage IV (late stage) includes *(i)
joint stiffness and (ii) each item included in
stage III.
A 5-ml sample of venous blood was
collected into IMPROVACUTERÕ EDTA
K2 tubes (IMPROVE MEDICAL
Technology, Guangzhou, China) before the
patients started treatment with prednisolone
and/or disease modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs. Blood samples were centrifuged at
2000 g at room temperature for 20 min in
a BY-320 C centrifuge (Baiyang Medical
Instrument Company, Beijing, China)
and stored at À80C until analysis. The
blood samples were analysed by routine
methods for erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) (Westergren's blood sedimentation
tube; Hull Medical Science and Technology,
Hefei, China), platelet count (PLT) (SYSMEX
XE-2100TM Automated Haematology System;
SYSMEX, Kobe, Japan) and C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) (IMMAGEÕ 800 Turbidimetric
942 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
Inhibition Immunoassay System; Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Rheumatoid
factor (RF) was measured using the latex
agglutination test (Rheumatoid Factor
Reagent Kit; Rongchuan Biotechnology
Company, Shanghai, China) and a positive
titre was >1/20. Anti-CCP levels were
analysed using an ImmunoscanCCPlusÕ
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(Euro Diagnostica, Malmo
¨ , Sweden) according
to the manufacturer's instructions and the
minimum detectable concentration was
0.1 U/l. Serum COMP levels were measured
using the Human COMP ELISA assay
(Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle,
WA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The minimum detectable
concentration was 0.4 ng/ml, and the
intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of
variation were both <5%.
Patient subgroups
The patients with RA were divided into two
groups according to the information
obtained from the physical examination,
laboratory tests, and X-ray imaging.6,25,27
Patients were considered to have active
disease if four of five of the following items
were satisfied: (i) there was moderate joint
pain at rest; (ii) the duration of morning
stiffness was !1 h; (iii) there was swelling
of > three joints; (iv) there was pressing pain
in > eight joints; (v) ESR > 30 mm/h or
CRP > 8 mg/l. Patients were considered to
be in remission if ! five of the following
items were satisfied and had been in exist-
ence for !2 months: (i) the duration of
morning stiffness was 15 min; (ii) there is
no lack of strength; (iii) there was no joint
pain at rest; (iv) there was no joint pain or
pressing pain when undertaking activity; (v)
there was no joint or sheath soft tissue
swelling; (vi) ESR 30 mm/h (for females)
or 20 mm/h (for males).
The patients with RA were divided into
two groups according to the information
that was obtained from the X-ray imaging of
the patient's hands: patients with joint bony
damage as demonstrated by abnormal
changes observed on the X-ray examination
(stages II­IV); and patients without joint
bony damage as confirmed by the lack of
abnormal changes on the X-ray examination
(stage I).27
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 19.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous data are presented
as the mean Æ SD. Differences in continuous
variables between groups were determined
using Student's t-test or the Mann­Whitney
U-test. Categorical data are presented as n of
patients (%). Differences between categor-
ical variables were analysed using Pearson's
2-test or Fisher's exact test. The sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative pre-
dictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively)
of COMP and anti-CCP for the diagnosis of
RA were assessed. Optimum cut-off values
are calculated to optimize sensitivity and
specificity (i.e. the Youden index). Receiver-
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
plotted and the areas under the ROC curves
were calculated to assess the performance of
each marker to distinguish RA. A P-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant (two-tailed).
Results
This case­control study enrolled 82 patients
with RA and 34 healthy control subjects.
There was no significant difference in the
mean Æ SD age of the group of patients with
RA compared with the control group
(49.93 Æ 11.15 versus 47.60 Æ 15.49 years,
respectively; Student's t-test). Among the
82 patients with RA, the mean Æ SD disease
duration was 3.79 Æ 5.45 years, the mean Æ
SD duration of morning stiffness was
Liu et al. 943
1.47 Æ 1.67 h, the mean Æ SD joint tender-
ness index score was 11.91 Æ 16.82, the
mean Æ SD joint swelling index score was
10.37 Æ 14.16, the mean Æ SD joint activity
pain index score was 17.93 Æ 20.83, and the
mean Æ SD joint resting pain index score
was 3.39 Æ 7.54.
The baseline laboratory characteristics
of the study population are presented in
Table 1. The serum COMP and anti-CCP
antibody levels were significantly higher in
patients with RA compared with the control
group (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons).
There were no significant difference in
the ESR, CRP, PLT or RF levels between
patients with RA and healthy control
subjects.
The serum COMP levels were compared
among different subgroups of patients
with RA and healthy control subjects
(Table 2). The serum COMP levels were
significantly higher in the patients with RA
compared with the healthy control subjects
(P < 0.0001).The serum COMP levels were
significantly higher in the patients with RA
with active disease compared with patients
with RA in remission (P < 0.0001). The
serum COMP levels were significantly
higher in the patients with RA in remission
compared with healthy control subjects
(P < 0.0001).The serum COMP levels
were significantly higher in the patients
with RA with joint bony damage compared
with patients with RA without joint
bony damage (P ¼ 0.0156).There was no
significant difference in the serum COMP
level between male and female patients
with RA.
The ROC of COMP and anti-CCP for
discriminating RA patients from healthy
control subjects were analysed. The areas
under the curves (AUC) for COMP (AUC
0.864; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.790,
0.937) was significantly greater than that of
anti-CCP (AUC 0.764; 95% CI 0.674, 0.854;
P ¼ 0.0015) (Figure 1). Optimal cut-off
values for COMP and anti-CCP were
21.51 ng/ml and 34.76 RU/ml, respectively.
At these cut-off values, diagnostic validity
such as sensitivity, specificity, positive pre-
dictive value, negative predictive value, and
accuracy were calculated (Table 3).

Discussion
The main findings of this present study
include the following: (i) serum COMP
levels were significantly higher in patients
with RA compared with healthy control
subjects; (ii) serum COMP levels were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with active RA
compared with patients with RA in remis-
sion; (iii) serum COMP levels in patients
with RA who also had joint bony damage
were significantly higher compared with
patients with RA who did not have joint
bony damage; and (iv) a serum COMP level
of 21.51 ng/ml was the optimal cut-off value
for discriminating between patients with
RA and healthy control subjects. Based
on the above findings, this present study
demonstrated that COMP could be a useful
laboratory marker for discriminating
between patients with RA and healthy indi-
viduals, and it could also be used to judge
the severity of the disease; findings that were
in accordance with other research.8 A pre-
vious study concluded that serum COMP
was significantly higher in patients with RA
compared with healthy subjects; and it was
also significantly higher in patients with
joint destruction compared with those
patients in the early stages of the disease,
but its levels were affected by age, disease
duration, and body mass index.29 In con-
trast, another study reported a sensitivity of
15%­48% and a specificity of 66%­69% for
COMP as a marker for RA.20 It has also
been suggested that the usefulness of testing
for COMP as a marker of joint damage
should be confirmed by additional and
preferably longitudinal studies.21 In add-
ition, this present study is the first to
demonstrate the optimal cut-off value of
COMP for discriminating between patients
with RA and healthy individuals.
This present study found that the serum
COMP level was not only a useful labora-
tory marker for discriminating between
patients with RA and healthy control sub-
jects, but it also discriminated between the
different stages of joint bone damage. Other
methods exist for the diagnosis of RA and
for the determination of disease severity,
such as RF, CRP, ESR, anti-CCP and bone
imaging.30,31 In this present study, the RF,
CRP, ESR and anti-CCP levels were also
measured. Although the anti-CCP levels
were significantly higher in the patients
with RA compared with the healthy control
subjects, its predictive accuracy was not as
high as that determined for COMP (0.672
versus 0.836, respectively). There were no
significant differences in RF, CRP, and ESR
between the patients with RA and the
healthy control subjects. Anti-CCP levels
demonstrated a high specificity (0.824) and
low sensitivity (0.610) for discriminating
between patients with RA and healthy con-
trol subjects. Another study reported that
CRP and ESR may not reflect the early stage
of bony damage in RA and their sensitivity
and specialty were low when used for RA in
clinical practice.32 The imaging features
of bones often change during the bone
destructive stages of RA and bony damage
often causes deformation.7 Thus, an early
diagnosis based on the results of a physical

examination, radiographs and ESR may not
be useful for establishing a therapeutic strat-
egy. Therefore, a method with high sensitivity
and specificity is needed for the early stage
evaluation of bone joint dysfunction.
In this present study, the serum COMP
level demonstrated an acceptable diagnostic
performance for discriminating between
patients with RA and healthy control sub-
jects. A COMP level of 21.51 ng/ml was the
optimal cut-off value for discriminating RA
patients from healthy individuals. The AUC
of COMP to predict RA was high (0.864),
and when using the COMP cut-off of
21.51 ng/ml to rule out and rule in the
presence of RA, the percentage of correctly
classified patients was 81.7% (i.e. sensitivity)
and the percentage correctly classified as not
having RA was 88.2% (i.e. specificity).
However, it should be noted that COMP
levels can be influenced by factors such as
muscle mass, sex, age and diet.7
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, the sample was selected from a
city-level hospital, which may cause some
limitations in the extrapolation of results;
thus, when extrapolating the results of this
study, the representativeness of the sample
should be considered. Secondly, the patients
in the study had RA with a relatively long
disease duration, so the individual's COMP
values may have been affected by multiple
factors, which might have then influenced
the optimal cut-off value.
In conclusion, this present study demon-
strated that serum COMP levels have the
potential to be used as a biological marker
of cartilage metabolism in RA. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to demon-
strate the diagnostic ability of COMP for
differentiating between patients with RA
and healthy individuals. These findings
also indicated that a cut-off value of
21.51 ng/ml for serum COMP could be
useful for the discriminating between
patients with RA and healthy individuals.
The monitoring of COMP levels in serum
could also be a helpful method for assessing
the presence and progression of RA.
