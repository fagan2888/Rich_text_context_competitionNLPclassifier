Introduction
Teacher education programs across the nation are being
called on to prepare their graduates to serve an increasingly
diverse student population. Most states have a mandate that
requires teacher candidates to take one or more prescribed
multicultural courses before certification is granted. But,
teaching diversity at the college level can be tricky. This is
due in part because there are definition problems, process
and methodology issues, higher levels of emotions, self-
esteem issues, opinions, religious and cultural differences,
and politics that must be traversed compared with other
fields of study (Banks, 2009; Nieto & Bode, 2012; Stockman,
Boult, & Robinson, 2008; Sue & Sue, 2013). Adding to the
confusion is the fact that Barack Obama, a Black man, was
elected in 2008 to the Presidency of the United States and
reelected again in 2012. Many White and conservative stu-
dents use this as evidence that America no longer has a major
race relations problem. Minorities and liberals, however, use
the July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman for the death
of Trayvon Martin as evidence that we are far from reaching
optimal results.
Navigating the mine-laden field of multicultural instruc-
tion can be mentally and physically exhausting. A sampling
of problems an instructor might encounter include dealing
with administrators and curriculum specialists who agree to
supplement the curriculum without truly transforming it
(Freire, 2005; Jay, 2003; Nieto & Bode, 2012); instructors of
color being disproportionately assigned to teach diversity
course offerings (Ladson-Billings, 2005; Perry, Moore,
Edwards, Acosta, & Fret, 2009); deciding which groups to
eliminate due to a lack of instructional time (Boyer-Fier &
Ramsey, 2005); wading through a plethora of typologies that
appear to have little articulation (Castagno, 2009); students
who insist on a non-threatening, color-blind style of curricu-
lum (Gordon, 2005; Richardson & Villenas, 2000); dealing
with students who desire a simple recipe approach as opposed
to learning how to problem-solve (DiAngelo & Sensoy,
2010); students having difficulty accepting concepts such as
White privilege (Campbell, 2010) and affirmative action
(Heriot, 2011); dealing with a range of intense student emo-
tions (Mio & Barker-Hackett, 2003); and adequately account-
ing for and explaining the emotional consequences of racism
(Sue & Sue, 2013).
One of the ways students express resistance to multicul-
tural education is through constantly bringing up counter-
argumentsandexceptionstotherules(Mio&Barker-Hackett,
2003). An example would be the student who resists

Effective Multicultural Instruction:
A Non-Color-Blind Perspective
Franklin T. Thompson1
Abstract
The reason why the Trayvon Martin murder trial and similar court cases create a philosophical rift in our nation is due in
part to flaws in the delivery of multicultural education. Traditional multicultural instruction does not prepare citizens for the
subtleties and complexities of race relations. This study investigates critical strategies and practices that address multicultural
missing gaps. I also seek to fill a void in the literature created by a lack of student input regarding teaching strategies that
encourage lifelong learning. Students (N = 337) enrolled at a Midwestern university were asked to rate the efficacy of selected
instructional strategies. Utilizing a 9-point Likert-type scale, students gave themselves a personal growth rating of 7.15 (SD
= 1.47). Variables important to predicting that growth (R2 = .56, p < .0005) were a six-factor variable known as a non-color-
blind instructional approach (t = 10.509, p  .0005), allowing students an opportunity to form their own opinions apart
from the instructor (t = 4.797, p  .0005), and a state law that mandated multicultural training (t = 3.234, p = .001). Results
demonstrated that utilizing a 35% traditional and 65% critical pedagogy mixture when teaching multicultural education helped
promote win/win scenarios for education candidates hoping to become difference makers.

comprehending problems that emanate from the abuse of
power and privilege by making statements such as, "I treat
all people with dignity and respect. All we need is love."
Educators need to do a better job of teaching students how to
(a) go beyond the surface level of analyzing disadvantage
and (b) release themselves from historic guilt so they can
redirect wasted energy toward creating solutions to social
problems. "Faculty members need to employ instructional
strategies that empower students, rather than provoke defen-
siveness" (Anderson, MacPhee, & Govan, 2000, p. 39). The
educator's highest priority should not be discovering things
that make our job easier or creating a classroom atmosphere
where students feel safe and warm, but rather on maximizing
the impact the experience will have on students becoming
difference makers.
Despite potential setbacks, the instruction of multicultural
education can be a rewarding and productive experience.
This study seeks to highlight critical strategies and practices
that encourage lifelong learning in multicultural education.
Student Input
Current debate regarding effective instructional strategies
tends to exclude the views of teacher candidates. "Students
are a viable and important (yet neglected) source of informa-
tion about the impact of multicultural education" (Anderson
et al., 2000, p. 52). Effective teachers are not only theoreti-
cally sound and challenging; they also find ways to include
students as partners (Zeichner et al., 2001). Effective teach-
ing must start from the students' life experiences, not the
teacher's perspective (Gollnick & Chinn, 2013).
During the few times when a student voice is offered, it
mostly comes from a primary and secondary education per-
spective. Gollnick and Chinn (2013), for example, offer
these findings: Graduating high school students wanted their
teachers to (a) be passionate about their work, (b) connect
instruction to issues they care about outside of school, (c)
give students choices when it comes to problem-solving
activities, and (d) make learning more than just an academic,
cerebral affair. Many high school minority students emotion-
ally drop out of school because their voices and experiences
are silenced or ignored.
Research that studies student opinion about multicultural
education at the college level is sparse. Rudney and Marxen
(2001) surveyed 25 graduates of an elementary teacher edu-
cation program and identified the following correlates of
good multicultural instruction: (a) adequate attention must
be given to learning style differences, (b) emphasize on
cross-cultural communication skills, (c) expose students to a
variety of curriculum approaches, (d) promote the articula-
tion of multicultural goals in all courses and not just in stand-
alone offerings, (e) provide mandatory field placements in
diverse settings, and (f) provide additional immersion oppor-
tunities (e.g., visits to social service agencies, ethnic
churches, parades, etc.).
Anderson et al. (2000) surveyed current and former col-
lege students and summarized the following instructional
correlates: (a) dynamic and thought-provoking lectures and
discussions, (b) exposing students to facts and statistics that
help address missing gaps, (c) readings and homework that
force students to compare and contrast different theories, (d)
reflective exercises and self-exploration activities, (e) simu-
lation games, (f) collaborative research projects, (g) persua-
sive guest speakers, and (h) a diverse class composition.
Outside of these two (and perhaps a few more) hard-to-find
studies, there is little written about the multicultural views of
college students. My study hopes to fill a portion of that gap.
Best Practices
The literature is replete with macro suggestions of what
makes for good multicultural education. Most of it is from a
theory, program, or political point of view, however.
Conversely, there is not enough in the literature that addresses
(a) missing gaps, (b) the art of multicultural curriculum
delivery, and (c) how to deal with learner resistance.
James Banks (2009) offers foundational perspectives for
multicultural teacher training. The following is a paraphrase
of those suggestions:
 1. Aperson's cultural identity can and should be defined
by more than just racial and ethnic factors. There are
many components of cultural identity (pp. 15-16);
2. Because of our country's history, the study of racism
deserves to have its day in the sun without being
watered down. Still, we must also acknowledge that
the true study of multiculturalism goes beyond mere
race (pp. 72-73);
3. The ethnic experience cannot fully be understood apart
from a nation's struggle for power. The abuse of power
and privilege has as much to do with explaining racism
as does skin color, culture, and beliefs (pp. 78-80);
4. While it is important to discuss global education, it
should not be confused with multicultural education.
While the former deals with interrelationships
between nations, the latter deals with the interaction
of groups within a nation (pp. 23-25);
5. The purpose of multicultural education is not to dimin-
ish the accomplishments of European culture, but
rather to highlight the contributions of non-western
and indigenous peoples. The accomplishments ofALL
ethnic groups, whites included, should be celebrated
(pp. 69, 231);
6. Sometimes it is better to teach multiculturalism from
a theme base, as opposed to a specific event. For
example, teaching about discrimination while using
examples such as slavery, the Trail of Tears, and the
Holocaust sends a stronger universal message about
humankind's inhumanity towards one another than
just highlighting only one of those topics (pp. 92-94);
Thompson 3
 7. We must learn to investigate an event from multiple
angles. The causes of WWI, for example, may be
viewed quite differently by Europeans, as compared
to that of populations from the Mideast. We should
teach a wide range of perspectives, then allow stu-
dents an opportunity to make up their own minds
(pp. 23-24);
8. Ethnic studies must be conducted from an interdisci-
plinary perspective. A study of diversity utilizing
only traditional inputs such as history, literature, and
music will leave out important pieces of information
that could help students see a bigger and more com-
plete picture (pp. 33-38);
9. Teachers must understand the various levels of cur-
riculum delivery. For example, the contributions
approach focuses on low-level learning such as
heroes and holidays. The additive approach adds to
the curriculum without changing its structure. The
transformative approach identifies missing pieces,
while also creating new ways of viewing and defin-
ing truth. Unfortunately, too many diversity instruc-
tors teach at the two lower levels without promoting
higher-order thinking skills (pp. 18-22);
10. It is not enough to just arm students with knowledge.
Educators must provide opportunities for social
action aimed at bettering society (p. 105); and
11. The teaching of race identity development theory
greatly enhances minority self-awareness. It helps
teachers understand why some minority students
resist instruction. It also provides educators with a
path for how to engage and encourage resistant learn-
ers (pp. 62-65).
Sonia Nieto and Patty Bode (2012) suggest a critical ped-
agogy approach to multicultural education--curriculum that
seeks to reinvent the rules of how we live. The importance of
not watering down racism, elevating the study of multicul-
tural education to the level of other academic subjects, and
the infusion of multicultural goals into all course offerings is
highly recommended. Effective multicultural education is
seen as instruction that leads to (a) social justice, (b) student
reflection, (c) an equal emphasis on content and process, and
(d) the acquisition of problem-solving skills.
Sleeter and Grant (2009) describe five approaches that
curriculum specialists and school officials rely on when set-
ting up a program of study: (a) teaching the culturally differ-
ent, (b) human relations approach, (c) single studies, (d)
multicultural education, and (e) social justice education.
Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, but any of
the choices is better than the business-as-usual paradigm that
is still popular in many academic circles.
Although John Farley (2010) writes from a sociological
perspective, educators can learn a lot from his analysis of the
role that ego defense mechanisms play in resisting multicul-
tural messages. For example, some individuals may choose
to hate Jews as a way of displacing their own personal
and business failures. Other unconscious mental games that
people play include the following paraphrased Farley
examples:
1. If I can prove that I am a good person on the individ-
ual-to-individual level, then that gives me permission
to ignore disparities that exist at the group level.
Furthermore, if one of the "good minorities" made it
out of the ghetto but others fail to do the same, I can
safely assume that it is because they didn't apply
themselves properly (pp. 17-18).
2. If Koreans and Japanese come over to America and
succeed despite the odds stacked against them and
Mexicans, African Americans and Indians don't do
the same, it's because the latter groups are lazy [i.e.,
a general problem of not understanding the differ-
ences between colonized and immigrant minority
groups]. (pp. 141-145)
The many connections between multicultural resistance
and ego defense mechanisms constitute a fascinating field of
study that is vastly overlooked by multicultural instructors.
A Call for Dispositions
The practice of assessing the dispositions of pre-service edu-
cators has gained increasing attention among institutions of
higher learning. Teacher dispositions strongly influence the
impact educators have on student development (Collinson,
Killeavy, & Stephenson, 1999; Notar & Taylor, 2009).
Teacher preparation programs must help candidates develop
the necessary dispositions to be effective educators (Rike &
Sharp, 2008). Unless teachers are willing to explore beyond
the familiar comfort zone of the majority culture, the educa-
tion of students of color will be shortchanged (Dee & Henkin,
2002). Training for greater multicultural awareness is an
often-overlooked part of teacher preparation (Gay, 2003;
Tozer, Senese, & Violas, 2006).
The term dispositions has been used in so many different
contexts that finding a working definition is hard to come by
(Borko, Liston, & Whitcomb, 2007). For purposes of this
study, the following Gollnick and Chinn (2013) definition will
be used: Dispositions are "Values, commitments, and profes-
sional ethics that influence teaching and interactions with stu-
dents, families, colleagues, and communities" (p. 379).
The movement toward greater professionalization of
teaching through assessment-based accreditation was spear-
headed by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher
Education (NCATE; 2008) as a way to determine whether a
person was the right match for the classroom, thus the rein-
forcement of dispositions. This study is grounded in that rec-
ommendation. I concur with NCATE officials that the
training of teacher candidates in the areas of skill and knowl-
edge without the added inclusion of exploring mind-sets that
4 SAGE Open
enhance student learning results in incomplete teacher prepa-
ration. It is important to note that the call for dispositions by
NCATE is at the overall professional level (Standard 1), as
well as a need for teachers to become proficient in diversity
issues (Standard 4; NCATE, 2008). From this perspective,
the usage of dispositions becomes a best practice that I incor-
porate into my teaching.
Dispositions as formulated by the Interstate Teacher
Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC)--an agency
that collaborates with state teacher licensing departments--
provide another portion of the theoretical framework for this
research. The following eight multicultural dispositions are
gleaned from a broader set of 43 recommendations teachers
should embrace to better serve our children (Council of Chief
State School Officers, 2011, pp. 13-18). Effective teachers
1. Believe that all children can learn and persist in help-
ing each learner reach his or her potential;
2. Realize that content knowledge is not a fixed body of
facts but is complex, culturally situated, and
ever-evolving;
3. Recognize the potential of bias in their representation
of the discipline and seek to appropriately address
problems of bias;
4. Constantly explore how to use disciplinary knowl-
edge as a lens to address local and global issues;
5. Respect learners' diverse strengths and needs and are
committed to using this information to plan effective
instruction;
6. Are committed to deepening awareness and under-
standing the strengths and needs of diverse learners
when planning and adjusting instruction;
7. Value the variety of ways people communicate and
encourage learners to develop and use multiple forms
of communication; and
8. Are committed to deepening an understanding of
their frames of reference, the potential for biases in
these frames, and their impact on expectations for
and relationships with learners and their families.
Not all writers agree that dispositions can or should be
assessed. Damon (2007), for example, argues that (a) dispo-
sitions in teacher education risk becoming poorly defined
constructs that are interpreted in open-ended ways to suit the
subjective biases of the evaluator, and that (b) while the tra-
ditional scientific discussion of a disposition emphasizes a
birth-to-adult process that impacts personality development,
the NCATE definition focuses only on the candidate's here-
and-now, value-driven conduct. This can cause a misalign-
ment of purpose between established research and current
practice. There is also concern that loosely defined standards
of dispositions can lead to the elimination of people who do
not pass a political litmus test, which could potentially lead
to intimidation and fear of being eliminated from teacher
preparation programs (Damon, 2007; Dee & Henkin, 2002).
Some writers (Dee & Henkin, 2002; Gollnick & Chinn,
2013) call for a closer marriage between multicultural educa-
tion and the dispositions movement. Aside from NCATE and
InTASC standards, however, multicultural dispositions are
less defined in the literature compared with the broader pro-
fessional dispositions discourse. If pursued, this marriage
will need to be more than just a symbolic exercise. It must
contain a workable link between ensuring educator First
Amendment rights of speech on one hand, while also
acknowledging the efficacy of creative and non-traditional
perspectives that ethnic groups identify as helpful to their
development on the other hand.
Despite reservations, Damon (2007) believes that stu-
dents deserve to be instructed by teachers who are ethics-
driven, but only if educators can find ways to address the
problems of definition and assessment. Borko et al. (2007)
and Duplass and Cruz (2010) believe that despite the lack of
metrically sound assessment measures, we must find creative
ways to provide on-going constructive feedback for teacher
candidates regarding dispositions. Other writers (Burant,
Chubbuck, & Whipp, 2007; Diez, 2007) who are conflicted
about dispositions agree that, if done correctly, students can
benefit from instruction that encourages an educator code of
ethics that can be assessed.
I strongly believe it is possible to define and identify mul-
ticultural dispositions in meaningful and operational ways. A
viable example of how to accomplish this does exist
(Thompson, 2013). It is also possible to assess dispositions
in fair and equitable manner, especially if you have a design
that (a) allows students to grade and monitor themselves and
(b) counsels and encourages resistant students, as opposed to
exiting them from their program of study (Thompson, 2009).
Non-Color-Blind Curriculum (NCBC)
In addition to the review of literature, this study will also pull
from the 35 years of experience I have with teaching multi-
cultural education. Over the years, I have developed a macro
perspective called non-color-blind curriculum (NCBC). It is
defined as a style of teaching that attempts to go beyond the
feel-good, "I treat everybody like I would want to be treated"
approach to instruction. NCBC builds on a collaborative,
synthesis approach to teaching and learning. Although
NCBC borrows elements from the critical race theory, criti-
cal pedagogy, and critical theory schools of thought, it does
not abandon the underlying principles of the Western tradi-
tions of rational inquiry.
The tenets of NCBC agree with Max Horkheimer and the
Frankfurt School that learning must accomplish more than
just the promotion of knowledge--that we must use educa-
tion to liberate ourselves (Ray, 2003). Likewise, NCBC
agrees with Delgado and Stefanic (2012) that the phenome-
non of white privilege is greatly understated in current dis-
cussions and that many civil rights advances made on the
behalf of African Americans coincided with the self-interest
Thompson 5
of the white elite. Still, NCBC is hesitant to embrace fringe
critical race theorists who call for such remedies as separat-
ism and reparations.
The principles of NCBC also agree with the views of Joan
Wink (2010) and other leading critical pedagogists that
teachers must redistribute classroom power so that students
take more responsibility for their own education. While it is
true that sharing power encourages intellectual character and
discourages the promotion of simple mimicry of the profes-
sional style, it is also true that many 20-year-olds require
deeper levels of knowledge and guidance before they are
able to make critical decisions about topics such as race,
power, and privilege. NCBC acknowledges the need for a
delicate balance between mentoring students and utilizing
traditional teaching methods on one hand, while empowering
learners to critically think, self-explore, and reinvent truth on
the other hand.
In addition to the generalized description given above, the
following is a more detailed listing of strategies and perspec-
tives that underlie the NCBC approach:
1. Even though anti-racism still remains the central
theme of multicultural education, its study must now
include multiple examples of oppression. Addressing
non-race forms of discrimination must not be done in
trivial ways;
2. Giving all cultural groups equal time is unrealistic.
Because it is impossible to cover all groups in a
17-week course, students will need to learn basic
social justice principles from a sampling of diversity
populations, then apply the general themes and prin-
ciples learned to all groups;
3. A politically correct (i.e., color-blind) approach is
viewed as insufficient. Its ultimate goal appears to
make teacher candidates feel-good without adequately
addressing real problems within our communities;
4. Multicultural education should never be an awareness-
only exercise. The attainment of cross-cultural com-
munication skills, greater levels of insight,
self-efficacy for disadvantaged kids, and change
agency are preferred goals;
5. Controversy should not be shunned, but rather
embraced. Good learning happens when instructors
face problems head on and skillfully address, not
avoid, controversy;
6. Once traditional indices are accounted for, additional
attention must be given to power and privilege issues,
as well as the abuses that often flow from them;
7. Successful multicultural instruction must pay atten-
tion to both content and process. One cannot be sac-
rificed at the expense of the other;
8. In order for meaningful lifelong learning to take
place, instruction must simultaneously be aimed at
the head (academic), gut (feeling), and heart (social
change) levels;
9. Effective multicultural education is greatly enhanced
by engaging in interactive learning experiences. The
lecture-only method is not good enough;
10. Multicultural education must take on an interdisci-
plinary mentality. It should include a synthesis of
information gathered from many fields of study. It
should not only investigate people, places, and
events, but also pay attention to psychological forces
that explain multicultural rejection and ego defense
mechanisms that encourage learner resistance;
11. The instructor must become adept at releasing major-
ity group students from historical guilt, while at the
same time recruiting them to become change agents;
12. Effective multicultural education is enhanced when
instruction highlights the pain and suffering of disad-
vantaged groups, as well as testimonials about how
obstacles were overcome. A delicate balance between
messages of pain and triumph is needed for the suc-
cessful training of education candidates;
13. Partisan political pandering is viewed as counter-
productive to the ultimate goals of a diverse society.
Eclectic collaboration between political groups and
competing ideologies is highly encouraged. Common
ground can be found;
14. Student reflection and on-going self-assessment
make for a better professional. Self-analysis is not
our enemy; and
15. Educators who adopt a well-conceived dispositional
mind-set will have a greater opportunity to bring
about meaningful change in our schools compared
with those who are dispositional critics.
To a large degree, this research investigates the efficacy of
the NCBC approach that I have developed. But it also seeks
to allow students an opportunity to weigh in on what works
and what does not work for their personal and professional
development.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
This study addressed the following research questions:
Research Question 1: How are students impacted by
NCBC teaching strategies aimed at promoting greater
multicultural awareness?
Research Question 2: How do students respond to a
brand of multicultural instruction that is 35% traditional
and 65% critical pedagogy and questioning oriented?
Research Question 3: Are the results of this analysis
affected by certain demographic characteristics such as
race, gender, age, and political allegiance?
Going into the study, I rejected the null hypothesis for all
three questions. I hypothesized that NCBC would positively
impact students, that the 35/65 curriculum mixture would
6 SAGE Open
encourage deeper thought and greater analytical skills, and
that factors such as race and political allegiance would have
an impact on the findings.
Method
Participants
Participants who comprised a convenience sample for this study
were teacher and counselor candidates (N = 337) who attended
a Midwestern metropolitan university situated in an urban set-
ting of 800,000 people. One hundred twenty-one students (36%)
said that they had received no prior multicultural education. One
hundred sixty-six respondents (50%) had taken 1 to 3 prior
classes, while 45 persons (14%) had taken 4 or more classes.
Eighty-eight (26%) of the individuals surveyed were male and
249 (74%) were female. Three hundred persons (89%) were
Caucasian, while 37 (11%) were students of color. Of those 37,
15 were Hispanic, 13 were African American, and 9 were of
Asian descent. A low percentage of race minority students
applying to become an educator has been a long-standing issue
for this and many other communities.
There were 206 persons (61%) who fell in the 18 to 22 age
range, 67 persons (20%) within the 23 to 30 age range, and
62 individuals (19%) who were 31 to 58 years old. Two hun-
dred thirty-one persons (69%) possessed only a high school
degree, while 82 persons (24%) had obtained an associate's
or a bachelor's degree, and 23 individuals (7%) had a post-
bachelor's degree. Two hundred twenty respondents (66%)
were undergraduate education majors, while 59 (18%) were
graduates studying to be counselors (35 school and 24 agency
candidates). Fifty-two persons (16%) were non-education
majors who took the class as an elective.
Politically speaking, 65 individuals (20%) classified
themselves as being conservative, 70 persons (21%) as mod-
erate, 36 (10%) as liberal, and 84 people (25%) said they
were eclectic in their thinking. Seventy-seven (23%) were
politically undecided, and 3 people (1%) refused to answer
the question. The rationale for including political affiliation
on the survey was to test the popular stereotype (accurate or
not) that conservatives do not value the study of multicul-
tural education. I will investigate that stereotype through the
narrow lens of education majors.
The Survey Instrument
A copy of the survey is enclosed (see Appendix A). The first 2
items measure the impact that the treatment plan (i.e., instruc-
tion based on recommendations from the review of literature
and NCBC principles) had on student personal and profes-
sional growth or lack thereof.As previously mentioned, a 35%
traditional and 65% critical pedagogy approach to teaching
multicultural education will be used. To better aid the reader's
understanding of what that means, a comparison of the two
approaches is enclosed (see Appendix B). The remaining 13
survey items help the reader better understand the components
of NCBC. They also help highlight the need for educators to
emphasize both content and process when teaching multicul-
tural education. Additional items that solicit demographic
information round out the survey. The survey was cleared by
the university's institutional review board and administered at
the end of the semester. It was included in addition to the end-
of-semester evaluation students typically partake in.
Data Analysis
Utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) computer program, the following statistical analyses
were conducted:
1. A summarization of descriptive findings;
2. Several ANOVA analyses to estimate relationships
between selected survey responses and selected
demographic attribute variables;
3. A factor analysis to help clarify the delineation
between instructional and environmental impacts,
and to ascertain which constructs pass statistical
scrutiny for inclusion in a predictive model; and
4. A multiple regression analysis to determine which of
the instructional variables help predict personal and
professional growth.
Results
Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive results reveal interesting findings (see Table 1).
On a scale of 1 to 9 with 1 being the lowest and 9 being the
highest, respondents rated their personal growth as a result of
experiencing NCBC instruction with a mean score of 7.15 and
a professional growth score of 7.44. These are high marks for
a predominantly White population from a mostly conservative
part of the nation--students who were required to take a state
mandated multicultural course. Nothing was rejected. Students
rated all of the individual instructional strategies higher than
the average (i.e., mid-point) score of five. The two highest
instructional influences were (a) the class allowed me to form
my own opinion independent of the instructor's perspective
(7.97) and (b) the instructor's non-color-blind teaching
approach positively impacted me (7.76). The two lowest
instructional influences were: I was positively impacted by (a)
information gained from the textbook and other readings
(5.87) and (b) guest speakers who shared stories about per-
sonal trials and triumphs (6.97). Even these lower set of scores
represent solid multicultural acceptance, however.
Variables such as prior education, parents, religious train-
ing, and the individual's sense of "personal goodness" (i.e.,
environmental mediators) were important in forming the
multicultural worldview of students, but they did not have the
same impact as the NCBC instructional factors (see Table 1).
Of special note is the fact that prior education was the lowest
score (5.39) of any of the variables. Also significant was the
Thompson 7
fact that students did not want the instructor to exchange his
critical questioning, experimental style for a safer, more
standard teaching approach (2.53).

The hypothesis that significant differences would be found
as a result of disaggregating the data by selected
demographic variables had to be mostly rejected. By and
large, scores were relatively independent of race, gender,
class, and age (see Table 2). When looking at political alle-
giance, however, there were a few significant findings.
For example, conservatives were more likely to have (a) a
lower mean score (6.71, SD = 1.66) compared with moderates
(7.40, SD = 1.38) when looking at personal growth, F(4, 327)
= 2.74, p = .029; (b) a lower mean score (7.72, SD = 1.67)

compared with liberals (8.50, SD = 0.74) when looking at
the impact of a state mandate, F(4, 317) = 3.44, p = .009; and

als (6.61, SD = 1.68) when judging the textbook's impact on
learning, F(4, 326) = 2.47, p = .045. Effect size (d) scores were
.45 (small), .65 (medium), and .62 (medium), respectively.
Students who did not know what their political allegiances
were had the hardest time adjusting to the experimental
teaching style. People who were politically undecided were
more likely to have higher mean scores (4.13, SD = 2.12)
compared with liberals (2.92, SD = 2.02) and eclectic think-
ers (3.23, SD = 1.91) when it came to believing the instructor
should have experimented less, F(4, 325) = 3.17, p = .014.
Effect size scores were .58 (medium) and .46 (small),
respectively.
Factor Analysis
The results of the factor analysis (see Table 3) indicate that two
dimensions were being measured. The first construct was
labeled instructional correlates. It consists of the following six
teaching techniques: (a) a non-color-blind, critical style of
teaching; (b) a message that is aimed simultaneously at both
the head and heart; (c) the promotion of open dialogue that
addresses tough questions; (d) the usage of videos that high-
light human relations missing links; (e) guest speakers who
share persuasive stories about human relations' trials and tri-
umphs; and (f) the impact of the textbook and other reading
materials used for the course. These are the components of the
six-factor non-color-blind instructional variable identified in
the abstract of this article. Although each of the teaching strat-
egies can stand on its own merit, it is more accurate to account
for variances shared between variables. Therefore, the vari-
ables are included in the multiple regression model as a six
dimensional construct. The reader will note that Cronbach's
alpha coefficient for all six variables was above the .70 accept-
ability rule, meaning the construct was reliable.
A second construct was tabbed environmental influences.
It consists of the following four correlates: The influence of
(a) prior education, (b) parents and family upbringing,
(c) religious beliefs, and (d) the "naturally good person in
me." Unlike the first construct, the coefficients for these four
variables did not meet the .70 rule for establishing reliability.
Kachigan (1991) argues that results in the .40 to .69 range
should not be totally ignored because of the potential to
understand important part influences. Because a .50 cut-off
is only a guideline, however, each researcher must make his
or her own judgment call. I decided to reject the environmen-
tal influences coefficients because they were not reliable
enough to be included in my predictor model.
Multiple Regression Analysis
The results of the multiple regression analyses were encour-
aging (see Table 4). Variables important to predicting student
personal growth were the six-factor NCBC instructional
variable described above (t = 10.509, p  .0005), allowing
students the opportunity to form their own opinions indepen-
dent of those of the instructor (t = 4.797, p  .0005), and a
state law mandating multicultural education (t = 3.234, p =
.001). The linear equation for the three predictor model is
Personal Growth = -1.139 + .714 (Critical Teaching) + .248
(Independent Thinking) + .161 (State Mandate), R2 = .56, p <
.0005. The (F2) effect sizes were .17 (medium), .03 (small),
and 0.1 (less than small), respectively, for critical teaching,
independent thinking, and state mandate. It is important to
remember that regression analysis does not establish causa-
tion, but rather primarily speaks to predictive correlations.
Factors important to predicting students' professional
growth include the same variables as above but with a slightly
lesser impact, namely, non-color-blind instruction (t = 9.485,
p  .0005), allowing students the opportunity to form their
own opinions (t = 3.493, p = .001), and a state mandate (t =
2.947, p = .003). The linear equation for the three predictor
model is Personal Growth = -1.44 + .647 (Critical Teaching)
+ .181 (Independent Thinking) + .147 (State Mandate), R2
=.49, p < .0005. The effect sizes were .16 (medium), .02
(small), and 0.1 (less than small) for critical teaching,

curiosity, I included the factored environmental construct
into both models of the regression, but that move did not
significantly improve the prediction.
Discussion
Regarding the first research question, students responded
very positively to a non-color-blind, critical and questioning
brand of multicultural instruction. On a scale of 1 to 9 with 9
representing the most positive experience, students (N = 337)
rated their personal growth at 7.15 and their professional
growth at 7.44 (refer to Table 1). These are high scores taking
into account the level of emotion and controversy inherent in
teaching this topic in a predominantly white setting.
The dimensions of the six-factor NCBC variable utilized
for instruction include (a) a questioning, deep-seeking, explor-
atory, and critical brand of instruction; (b) a message that is
simultaneously aimed at the head, heart, and gut; (c) instruc-
tion that promotes open and honest student-to-student, and
student-to-instructor dialogue; (d) the usage of outside speak-
ers who are adept at highlighting both challenges and ways to
overcome obstacles; (e) the usage of videos that help make a
head-to-heart connection about the struggle of disempowered
people; and (f) written material and textbook readings that
inspire reflection and enhance multicultural awareness.
Respondents also placed a high value on the importance
of an instructor who encourages people to think about how
we think. The promotion of independent thinking was one of
the better received teacher strategies in this study. On one
hand, students do not want instructors to water-down the
material nor do they want us to handle them with kid's
gloves, on the other hand, they do not want to be told how to
think. Today's students appear to want educators to give
them all aspects of a debated topic and then trust them to
come up with their own conclusions. This is a good thing.
The null hypothesis regarding the impact of selected demo-
graphic influences was mostly accepted. By and large, scores
were relatively independent of race, gender, and age. When
looking at political allegiance, however, there were a few sig-
nificant findings, albeit none of them were surprising. For
example, respondents who did not know what their political
allegiances were had the hardest time adjusting to the experi-
mental instructional style. People who were politically unaware
or undecided were more likely to have higher mean scores com-
pared with liberals and eclectic thinkers when it came to believ-
ing the instructor should have experimented less. Likewise,
conservatives were more likely to have (a) a lower mean score
compared with moderates when looking at personal growth, (b)
a lower mean score compared with liberals when looking at the
impact of a state mandate, and (c) a lower mean score compared
with liberals when judging the impact of written material on
learning. Although the views of liberals and moderates were
somewhat more pro-multicultural education than that of conser-
vatives and undecided persons, those differences had small
effect sizes. By and large, all groups were benefitted by the
NCBC brand of multicultural instruction.
There were a couple of findings that I did not foresee
going into this research. For example, I was quite surprised
that nearly a quarter of my students did not understand the
concept of political affiliation. A show of hands during class
sessions also revealed that only 25% of them voted in the last
national election and even less in local elections. This is an
educational indictment aimed at the home, high school, and
college levels. In addition, I was somewhat surprised that
prior education and parental influence did not play a bigger
role, although the impact was by no means marginal.
Surprisingly, the highest score (8.07) on the post-survey was
given for support of a multicultural state mandate. Contrary
to popular myth, education candidates support the role of an
intervening governmental body on behalf of multicultural
education if it is explained and executed well. Whether or not
the multicultural optimism found in this study can be dupli-
cated for other non-education majors remains to be seen.
It is important to note that the goals of a traditional multi-
cultural approach are not bad--they are, however, incomplete.
The goal of the NCBC approach is to include important prin-
ciples that the traditional approach embraces, while also

extending the conversation into new areas that are often over-
looked or minimized. Students often spoke about the need for
teachers to "keep it relevant and keep it real." My 35/65 tradi-
tional-critical pedagogy curriculum mixture appears to suc-
cessfully accomplish this goal. When given a chance to state
that they wish the instructor had taken a more standard and
safer approach to instruction, students responded with a mean
score of 2.53 representing a dissenting view.
Quantitative results appeared to be aligned with anecdotal
commentary provided in the optional portion of the survey. A
few student samples include the following comments:
To be totally honest, I was dreading this class. Turns out I
learned a lot about life and about myself.
Thank you for teaching more than just me. Every time I learned
something new in your class I shared it with my husband and the
rest of my family.
You have provided me with so much education. You have
stretched my brain to think beyond the "Pollyanna" ways in
which I normally think.
To be sure, not all students were happy. Listed below is an
example of a negative review:
I leave this class more confused than when I first entered it.
Before this class I believed in treating everyone equal. Now, I
feel guilty for being white.
This study is not without limitations. First, even though a
multiple regression quotient of .56 is considered solid for the
social sciences, there may be other factors not accounted for
(i.e., student self-analysis, simulation games, self-disclosure,
use of humor, etc.) that could potentially improve the predic-
tion. Second, we are all aware of great curriculum designs that
are poorly articulated by marginal teachers. It is quite possible
then that poor designs can yield better-than-expected results
because of the professional and personal qualities of teachers.
More research needs to be conducted regarding the personal
and professional characteristics that master teachers possess.
Third, the study is also limited by the fact that until it is repli-
cated, the results cannot be generalized to a larger population.
Duplication of this work is sorely needed and welcomed.
Despite these limitations, the results of this study are
important because they highlight two separate, but related
gaps in the literature: (a) a set of user-friendly, critical-
oriented multicultural instructional strategies can be identified
and (b) there is a need to include more student input when
defining what makes for effective multicultural instruction.
Implications for Educators
It goes without saying that permeating instruction makes a
difference in student learning. Curriculum approaches that
were formed during the 1960s and 1970s provided a solid
foundation for multicultural education, but changing times
dictate that methods of teaching be adapted to reflect a
changing world. Since the early days of multicultural educa-
tion's inception, a true global society has emerged, and the
definition of diversity has broadened. In addition, it is no
longer acceptable to teach about personal possibilities with-
out also investigating the roadblocks that keep individuals
and society from reaching our full potential.
Many will say that the days of multicultural education are
numbered; that society is moving toward a meritocracy and
the need for such college course offerings is waning. While it
is true that race and social conditions have improved, we are
far from being out of the woods. Casual viewing of the eve-
ning news easily corroborates that conclusion. Misinformed
folks will try to make a claim that the election of Barack
Obama as President of the United States was a signal that
class and socioeconomic factors have replaced racism and
sexism as the main concerns of human relations. From my
point of view, that kind of thinking appears to be about 50
years too soon. We cannot afford to mistake the positive
changes taking place in our nation as evidence that our soci-
ety no longer needs to be educated. Still, it is incumbent on
classroom teachers to evolve with the times. Today's stu-
dents do not want the blame-game nor the feel-good brands
of multicultural education indicative of yesteryear's efforts.
While educators should never ignore the power of love
and the wisdom of treating others like we want to be treated
(i.e., a traditional approach), it is also imperative that we
investigate the deeper factors that keep good people divided.
The outcome of the recent Trayvon Martin murder trial is a
good example of how well-meaning people on both sides
operate from vastly different perspectives. In that case, con-
servative pundits failed to see how issues of power and privi-
lege blocked Florida jurors from understanding how
disempowered people communicate and react with authority
figures. I believe that a 35% traditional and 65% critical mul-
ticultural curriculum mix taught in our schools can help cre-
ate more opportunities for win/win results in cases like these.
Findings from this study appear to corroborate curriculum
suggestions found in the literature. For example, they agree
with Gordon (2005) that color-blind curriculum is insuffi-
cient; with Freire (2005) about the importance of dialogue;
with Nieto and Bode (2012) that content alone is not
enough--that the process of multicultural education is just as
important; with Banks (2009) that it is important for teachers
to critically teach many perspectives, and then trust students
to form their own opinions, and; with Anderson et al. (2000)
that including guest speakers who have a permeating story to
tell helps give the message of diversity staying power. My
study validates literature recommendations, but they also
encourage the coupling of correlates in new ways that are
seldom realized in the typical classroom.
My findings also address a concern by Perry et al. (2009)
that the pedagogical skills necessary for the required diversity
education classroom are, " . . . complex, extensive and may be
Thompson 11
beyond the skills that are modeled in current classrooms or
represented in typical instructional training and development
programs on campus" (p. 100). There is not enough in the lit-
erature that addresses the art of multicultural curriculum deliv-
ery. Undoubtedly, there are many programs and paradigms
that work, but we as educators need to get busy and share our
successes with each other. Strategies outlined here in the
review of literature, the introduction of NCBC instruction, and
the 35/65 melding of traditional and critical pedagogy
approaches (see Appendix B) provide one example of how the
multicultural teacher training gap can be closed.
The NCBC approach utilized in this study asserts that
there is more useful truth located somewhere along a critical
spectrum, as opposed to what we typically find at the fringes
of the political left or right. Criticism will undoubtedly ema-
nate from both sides. Traditionalists and conservatives will
hail the suggested approach as the end of national unity.
Critical pedagogists and education liberals will say it does
not go far enough--that hegemony and the abuses of the
powerful and privileged will remain protected for the benefit
of the elite. Both arguments have merit. One thing is clear:
There is no argument that something new and different must
be done. I believe that revolution is not always warranted;
that established legal and constitutional methods have the
potential to bring about meaningful social change. Many will
disagree. In the meantime, there is a war being waged against
children and many of them fall through the cracks of society
while pundits continue the debate.
This research is significant because students from a typi-
cally conservative part of the country were positively
impacted by a synthesis approach that 15 years ago would
have been labeled as radical or over-the-top. The difference
between now and then is threefold. First, students of all
colors and backgrounds today want a more meaningful edu-
cation that lines up with the everyday life they experience
outside of the classroom. Second, putting more emphasis
on the process and not just highlighting multicultural con-
tent is a key factor to greater multicultural awareness.
Third, the adoption of a critical pedagogy which infuses
discussions of power and privilege into the traditional con-
versation helps students better understand interference
points that account for the missing gaps in our human rela-
tions efforts.
The art of managing social polemics is never an easy road
to traverse. We as a people appear to be forever enslaved by
a day/night, either/or, black/white, up/down, devil/angel
existence. The critical middle is a hard place to find. This is
especially true with regard to race and human relations. But,
there is a remnant of young people that appear poised on the
horizon to one day crash the gridlock convention. They sing
a familiar song with its sacred chorus, but with new vigor
and interpretation: "Yes, we are truly free at last!" The results
of this study demonstrate that meaningful human relations
do not occur by happenstance, but rather by the purposeful,
critical, and creative efforts of educators to properly instruct
and inform students.

Appendix B
A Comparison of a Traditional Versus a Non-Color-Blind Approach to Multicultural Instruction
Traditional Multicultural Approach Non-Color-Blind Curriculum
I. Foundational principles (Note: NCBC incorporates many of the elements found in the traditional
curriculum approach, while also attempting to extend student awareness
into new awareness)
· 
Regardless of ethnicity, culture, gender, and family background, I
believe all kids can learn and they deserve my best effort.
· Do not fear diversity; we should celebrate it!
· 
A rising tide raises all boats.
· 
Education and dialogue will solve all social evils.
· 
It is better to be color-respective than to be color-blind. It is good to
sometimes question the status quo and political correctness.
· 
Unless you address the root of a "social weed," when it sprouts back up
it will be even more stubborn.
· 
Do not ignore the impact power and privilege has on disadvantage.
II. Probable multicultural worldview 
· 
The United States electing a Black President shows how far are nation
has come in race relations.
· 
Poverty, single-parenting, and miseducation are the main reasons for
continued social ills.
· 
Learned helplessness is just as much the fault as racism and poverty.
· 
The best way to train teacher candidates is to emphasize greater
knowledge and skill development. Dispositions are a slippery slope.
· 
Greed, abuse of power, and uncritical thinking are the real enemies.
· 
Highlighting the accomplishments of a few successful minority persons
while ignoring the problems of the many is neither fair nor wise. We
need to keep it real and honest when we teach.
· 
Yes, we should embrace controversy as a teaching tool.
· 
Awareness, knowledge, and skills are not enough. The application of
dispositions (if done correctly) is a key missing link.
III. Probable instructional strategies utilized 
· 
We must choose lessons and activities that create a safe, caring, and
accepting classroom atmosphere.
· 
We must choose lessons that highlight our similarities.
· 
We should utilize lessons that honor our heroes and their deeds.
· 
Language policing and practicing how to talk is a main component.
· 
We should use group work and interactive learning strategies.
· 
We should utilize journaling, service learning and portfolios.
· 
We must teach toward the gaps. Find the missing links. Teach both
content and process.
· 
It is imperative that we investigate power and privilege interferences.
· 
It is imperative that we investigate ego defense mechanisms.
· 
We must train future teachers to be critical thinkers.
· 
We should utilize reflection, dialogue, and interactive learning.
· 
We must utilize a 35/65 traditional-critical pedagogy curriculum mix.
IV. Potential impact on majority teachers 
· 
Now is the time to show how the other forms of discrimination are
just as bad as racism.
· 
There is a magic recipe that exists. Once I learn that recipe, all my
students will be successful.
· 
Once minority students learn the power of education and middle class
values and once white students learn not to stereotype, all will be fine.
· 
Yes our society has improved, but now is not the time to go soft on the
impact of racism.
· 
It's not about me or the views I happen to hold. It's about the kids!
· 
My intentions and being a good person have little correlation with
whether or not I am effective with hurting kids.
· 
I must change the world one kid at a time.
V. Potential impact on minority students 
· 
I did not realize that multicultural education is much bigger than race
and gender issues. I now see all forms of injustice must be addressed.
· 
The way to climb out of poverty and become successful is to (a)
assimilate and emulate the majority group, (b) rely on sports, music,
and other entertainment opportunities to escape my condition, or (c)
create a viable and legal alternative to the majority paradigm.
· 
Now that I have gained my freedom, it is now all about making money
and collecting material things.
· 
I don't have to stay bitter about life. I can forgive. I can overcome. I can
succeed. I can change my trajectory in life.
· 
Letting down my guard and learning to trust is not for the other guy; it's
for me. I will be better off by forgiving!
· 
In order for me to succeed in this society, I must become bi-culturally
competent!
· 
Life is not fair. Whether I like it or not, after I achieve my goals I will be
asked to reach back and help those less fortunate than I.
· 
I finally understand how the system works.
VI. Potential impact on majority students 
· 
I've always been a good person who means well. Now I can add to my
resume the fact that I have taken "the class." Love will conquer all.
· 
It is been an enlightening class, but still--is not the problem more the
older generation and not the people my age and younger?
· 
It is those "backward Whites" who are causing all the problems, not
we who are already enlightened.
· 
My best friend is black and I bowl with Asians.
· 
I have learned the magic of word-policing. I now know what to say and
what not to say. I found the recipe.
· 
I can see clearer now. There is more to this multicultural thing than I
first realized. I can now see that I did not understand the role power and
privilege plays in creating disadvantage.
· 
I need to put away my magic wand. Self-reliance and education are only
two of many tools needed for disadvantaged kids to beat the odds and
escape poverty.
· 
Even if we elect a woman or a race minority person to be President of
our nation, we still have more work to do.
· 
To whom much is given, much is required.
