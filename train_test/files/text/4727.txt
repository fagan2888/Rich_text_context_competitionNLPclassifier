Introduction
The history of second language writing research has wit-
nessed theoretical and methodological controversies over
whether L2 writing is primarily cognitive or social. There is
an increasing emphasis on the social and motivational con-
text within which the writing process is embedded. This view
originally emerged as a critique of purely cognitive
approaches to the teaching and learning of writing. So writ-
ing is no more approached as an individually written product
isolated from its context. This social view of L2 learning and,
thus, writing has received extra impetus since the 1990s by
an increasing interest in the application of the Vygotsky-
inspired sociocultural theory (SCT) to second and foreign
language research (e.g., Ellis, 1997; Nyikos & Hashimoto,
1997; Oxford, 1997; Scarcella & Oxford, 1992; van Lier,
1996; among others). Within this approach, writing is no
more considered as a nonlinear process and an individual
practice. Prior (2006) claims that cognitive paradigm is too
narrow in its understanding of the context, so the writing task
is approached within the SCT. It best describes the context of
writing activity in its totality. It offers a perspective within
which writing can be examined as a social practice, with stu-
dents as active participants in constructing learning pro-
cesses, and as a result, the interaction between different
factors can be explored. Lantolf (2000, 2002) states that the
central and distinguishing concept of the SCT is that the
human mind is always and everywhere socially and semioti-
cally mediated within the "zone of proximal development"
(ZPD), or "the domain of knowledge or skill where the
learner is not yet capable of independent functioning, but can
achieve the desired outcome given relevant scaffolded help"
(Mitchell & Myles, 2004, p. 196).
On the other hand, research on L2 writing has shifted its
focus from concentration on the final product of writing to
investigating the process of writing. This necessitates under-
lining L2 writing strategies to discover the actions and the
behaviors of L2 writers while producing written texts. A myr-
iad of studies have focused on the cognitive strategies the L2
writers use while writing, such as planning, analyzing, synthe-
sizing,reasoning,andmonitoring(Cumming,1989;Cumming,
Rebuffot, & Ledwell, 1989; Zamel, 1983). However, with the
recent shift from the cognitive to the sociocultural approach to
writing, L2 writing studies have reconceptualized writing
strategies within the sociocultural framework.

The Effect of Strategies-Based Instruction
on the Improvement of EFL Learners'
Writing Quality: A Sociocultural Approach
Mohammad Rahimi1 and Elmira Noroozisiam1
Abstract
The present study draws primarily on Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural approach and sets out to explore the effect of instruction
of sociocultural writing strategies on the improvement of EFL learners' quality of writing. The study was conducted with
two EFL writing classes randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 22) and a control group (N = 21) during a university
term. Although the students in both classes worked in groups while practicing writing, only the experimental group was
continuously taught to mediate their writings through different strategies and contextual mediations based on Engstrom's
(1987) activity theory. The students' individual writing scores at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were
compared, and the results convincingly proved that the experimental group made significantly more improvement in their
writing ability than did the control group. The analysis of the recorded students' interactions in both groups revealed that
the experimental group used almost all the sociocultural strategies while practicing writing, whereas the control group made
a very limited use of only some of these strategies.

However, very few studies have examined the use of L2
writing strategies within a sociocultural framework, which
are mainly descriptive in nature (e.g., Anton & DiCamilla,
1998; De Guerrero & Villamil, 2000; Fernandez, Wegerif,
Mercer, & Rojas-Drummond, 2001; Lei, 2008; Leki, 1993;
Storch, 2005; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Villamil & De
Guerrero, 1996; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009). For instance,
Anton and DiCamilla (1998) examined the use of L1 as a
powerful strategy of semiotic mediation in providing scaf-
folded help in the collaborative activities. De Guerrero and
Villamil (2000) demonstrated how two students, one as a
writer and one as a reviewer, learn from each other (a media-
tion strategy) during interaction in a peer-review activity.
Villamil and De Guerrero (1996) report five strategies used
by L2 learners while revising their writing. These strategies
included using symbols and external resources, using L1,
providing scaffolding, resorting to interlanguage, and vocal-
izing private speech via social interaction in L2 writing.
A relatively recent study by Lei (2008) investigated EFL
learners' writing strategy use based on activity theory
(Engstrom, 1987). She found four types of writing strategies
from two learners'mediated actions, that is, artifact-mediated,
rule-mediated, community-mediated, and role-mediated strat-
egies. She argues that L2 writing involves strategic mediation
of various resources in the world, and the use of writing strat-
egy is oriented toward a writer's goals in society.
Nonetheless, all the L2 writing strategies reviewed above
are descriptive in nature. That is, they have explored whether
and to what extent the L2 students use the sociocultural
writing strategies. None of these studies, however, has
focused on whether teaching these strategies could help L2
students mediate their writing more strategically through
using a variety of writing strategies and, as a result, develop
their writing ability. As Lei (2008) contends, "Although L2
learners might have already used some of these strategies,
they may not always be aware of the mediated processes or
potential strategies and be able to use them efficiently and
with control" (p. 232). As an impetus for further research on
sociocultural writing strategies, Lei (2008) underlines the
importance of L2 writing teachers raising the students' con-
sciousness about these strategies. In a similar vein, Van der
Veer and Van Ijzendoorn (1985) argue that, according to
activity theory, the natural upward movement from lower
order processes to higher order ones can be influenced by
direction and instruction.
The present study, hence, investigates the impact of
instructing the writing strategies within a sociocultural
framework on the improvement of L2 students' writing abil-
ity. Although acknowledging that group work may provide
opportunities for creative thinking, this research is specifi-
cally concerned with the use and nonuse of sociocultural
strategies in groups and the possible effect it brings about on
the quality of essay writing as a result of instruction and con-
sciousness raising. Triggered by the aspiration to address the
current gap and further extend sociocultural research in L2
writing, this study draws primarily on the SCT, activity the-
ory, and concept of mediation (a key element in the SCT) to
investigate the effect of strategies-based instruction within
the sociocultural framework on the quality of writing.
Writing quality is expected to meet the five content criteria
of communicative quality, organization, paragraphing, cohe-
sion, relevance, and adequacy (Jacobs, Zinkgraf, Wormuth,
Hartfiel, & Hughey, 1981). In other words, the negotiation
and interaction between learners, learning materials, tasks,
and context, as well as using cognitive and sociocultural
mediating strategies, make students active learners in the co-
constructing of the knowledge.
Theoretical Framework of the Study
The activity system model (Figure 1), which is used to depict
a framework for writing activities and mediating strategies,
and their interaction with each other within the sociocultural
approach, will be used as the theoretical framework of the
present study. The system implies the multidimensionality of
the context of second language writing and the possible
dynamic relationships between the elements.
The model comprises the following components: (a)
Subjects including students' attitude toward writing, motiva-
tion to write, their goals, and personal and world knowledge.
The subjects' collaboration in class is the substantial strategy
used during the writing. While in collaboration, the subjects'
schematic knowledge is at play, and they continuously tend to
utilize each other's factual, local, and sociocultural knowledge
when brainstorming and constructing the text. (b) Rules include
class norms such as the evaluation method adopted by the
teacher. Coded errors are left to be revised by peers in groups.
(c) Tools like guidelines, worksheets, and instructions, includ-
ing cognitive writing strategies instruction such as planning,
drafting, and revising. Tools can be internal or external, physi-
cal or symbolic mediating artifacts or signs. Concretely, tools
include Internet-mediated strategies, literary work-mediated
strategies, and L1- (through translation) and L2-mediated strat-
egies (through negotiating right grammar, structure, vocabu-
lary, and rhetoric). Through these strategies, the learners are
asked to compare their written texts with a native's model or
Figure 1. Activity system.

p. 222).

sign-mediate their text in the process of writing. (d) Object
(instructional objective). (e) Outcome (the development of
written texts) is the individual writings intended to be high in
quality. (f) Community (students and teachers in the classroom)
in which the activity is carried out and by which the activity is
negotiated. Campus-mediated strategies can be mentioned as
an example. The students strategically communicated with
people in the class and outside the class. (g) Division of labor
(the roles to play and the jobs to be shared in learning activities,
that of the learners and the teacher) assigns an active role to the
students and a role of facilitator to the teacher. Among role-
mediated strategies, one can refer to author-mediated strate-
gies, which are specified as trying to establish authorship as an
English writer or the consideration of the readers.
The model provides a proper theoretical foundation of the
study in a holistic manner as the epistemological stance of
the sociocultural turn defines human learning as a dynamic
social activity that is situated in physical and social contexts,
and distributed across persons, tools, and activities (Rogoff,
2003; Salomon, 1993; Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch, 1991).
The Study
The study through a triangular data-elicitation approach
(pre-test [treatment] post-test control group design) exam-
ines the effect of sociocultural strategies-based writing
instruction on writing quality. The study intends to answer
the following questions:
1. Does strategies-based writing instruction with a
sociocultural perspective have any effect on the
improvement of the students' writing ability and the
quality of their writing?
2. To what extent do the students use the instructed
sociocultural strategies in their interactions while
working in groups?
Participants
Participants of the study comprised 43 English majors (8
males and 35 females) studying at Shiraz University, Iran.
They participated in two intact essay writing classes taught
by the first researcher. The two classes were randomly
assigned to an experimental group (N = 22) and a control
group (N = 21). The results of a proficiency test administered
to the students of the two classes prior to the beginning of the
term indicated that the two groups were equal with respect to
their level of proficiency. The data were collected in the
course of one semester. None of the students had attended an
essay writing course before entering university.
Instruments
Two instruments were used in the present study. The first
instrument of the study was the Oxford Placement Test (OPT;
2004) utilized to ensure the homogeneity of the two groups
with respect to their general English proficiency.
The second instrument was Jacobs et al.'s (1981) scoring
rubric. The rubric contains five subsections, namely, content
criteria, organization criteria, vocabulary criteria, language
criteria, and mechanics criteria. Based on this 100-point
scheme, 30 points are allotted to the content of writing, 20
points to writing organization, 20 points to vocabulary use,
25 points to language use (mainly syntax), and 5 points to
mechanics. On the whole, 50% of the score assigned to the
writing quality is related to global aspects (content and orga-
nization) and 50% to the formal aspects (vocabulary, gram-
mar, and mechanics).
Materials
Essays.Throughout the semester, the participants wrote
seven essays, but only two essays--one written at the begin-
ning of the experiment and one at the end--were considered
as the materials of the study. The first essay, which was on an
argumentative topic, was written by the students before they
received any instructions on the organization and the process
of writing an essay. The second was an argumentative essay,
which was written by the students at the end of the semester.
The topics of the first and the last essays were, to some
extent, similar to control the genre as well as the lexical
items, and the structures needed for writing on that particular
topic. The topics of the two essays were as follows:
1. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Exams should be removed from the educational system
of the universities and the students must be evaluated
based on their performance in the classroom.
2. "Attending university classes should not be obliga-
tory." To what extent do you agree or disagree with
this opinion?
Audiotaped discourse. To triangulate the results of the study,
the students' oral interactions while writing and practicing
group essays were taped to see to what extent they used the
learned strategies while going through the different stages of
the writing process.
Data Collection Procedure
The data collection started 1 week before the commencement
of the experiment. Although the students were all sopho-
mores, to ensure that they were at the same level of profi-
ciency, the OPT was administered to both groups. Then, in
the first session of the course, the students were given an
argumentative topic to write an essay before receiving any
instruction on essay writing. This essay served as the pre-test
of the study; the purpose was to ensure that the two groups
were similar in terms of their tentative writing skill. These
essays were then scored in terms of quality, based on Jacobs
4 SAGE Open
et al.'s (1981) scoring rubric. To ensure the reliability of the
scores assigned to the essays, the two researchers scored
10% of the essays. The scores assigned to these paragraphs
were subjected to Cohen's Kappa's interrater reliability test.
The interrater reliability index acquired was .86. The rest of
the essays were scored by the second researcher only.
Starting from the second session, the process of writing
the expository essay and later the argumentative essay was
presented to both groups. However, during the course, the
instructor taught the sociocultural writing strategies to the
experimental group and continuously asked them to mediate
their learning by using these strategies.
Table 1 summarizes the sociocultural strategies adopted
in the instruction of the experimental group. The strategies
have been adopted from Lei's (2008) study.
The students in the experimental group were divided into
four groups of four and two groups of three. Each group
comprised students of three descending levels ofA, B, and C,
based on the writing scores they obtained on the first essay;
in fact, based on their scores, the students were divided into
three groups: 27% of the students with the highest scores
were put in Group A, 27% with the lowest scores in Group C,
and the remaining 46% in Group B. Care was taken to ensure
that each group (the groups consisting of four students) was
composed of one student from Group A, one from Group C,
and two from Group B. There was one student from each
group in the groups consisting of three students.
Then, in each session, depending on the usefulness and the
importance of the strategies to each stage of the writing pro-
cess, a combination of these strategies were introduced by the
teacher and practiced in class. The students'writing practices in
class were all in groups, and while they were working in
groups, the teacher wandered around the class and, besides
helping the students with their language problems when they
arose, monitored the students, ascertaining that they used the
strategies when needed. Each group was provided with an mp4
player to record all their interactions during the whole class
time. After practicing writing each essay type (expository and
argumentative) in groups (two for each), they were also
required to write essays of each type individually. In addition to
the pre-test, they wrote two individual essays (one on each
genre), the second of which (the argumentative essay), written
at the end of the experiment, served as the post-test of the study.
To sum, of the 16 class sessions, the students in the experimen-
tal group had 6 sessions of essay writing instruction along with
writing strategies instruction, followed by practice, and 10 ses-
sions of writing practice. The writings which were given con-
tent and form feedback by the teacher were revised
collaboratively as well.
The procedure for the control group was similar to that of
the experimental group, except that writing strategy instruc-
tion was not part of their class procedure. That is, the students
of this group were taught the process of writing the expository
and the argumentative essays, and practiced writing these
essays in groups, but the strategies mentioned above were not
taught to this group, and while working in groups, the teacher
only discussed the writing problems with the students. In fact,
it can be said that this group, too, enjoyed peer and teacher
scaffolding, as it is the case in any cooperative learning activ-
ity, but they did not learn and practice the writing strategies.
As in the experimental group, the students had 6 sessions of
essay type instruction and practice, and 10 sessions of group
practice in class. All the essays were examined in terms of
content, organization, task fulfillment, and form to be com-
pared later on within and between groups. Similar to the
experimental group, the students of this group were asked to
record their interactions while writing.
There were time and length limits on the individual essays
(pre- and post-tests); the students were required to write
essays of 300 to 350 words in 90 min.
Data Analysis
Quantitative data analysis was conducted to analyze the data
collected from OPT and the essays. A series of independent-
samples t-tests were run to compare the two groups' lan-
guage proficiency and writing quality at the beginning and at
the end of the term. Matched t-tests were used to compare
each group's writing quality at the beginning and at the end
of the term. The recorded interactions between the students
were transcribed and coded with based on the sociocultural
strategies indicated in Table 1.

indicated that two groups were equal with respect to their
general English proficiency and the writing ability.
Research Question 1: Does strategies-based writing
instruction with a sociocultural perspective have any
effect on the improvement of the students'writing abil-
ity and the quality of their writing?
Mean scores on the quality of the individually produced
writings by the students of the two groups at the beginning
and at the end of the term were calculated and compared
through an independent t-test. Table 3 illustrates the results
of the comparison of the two groups in terms of writing qual-
ity at the beginning and at the end of the instruction.
As the Table presents, the two groups were similar in
terms of their writing ability at the beginning of the term (t =
1.30, p > .05). However, the table reveals a significant differ-
ence between the means of the scores indicating the writing
quality of the two groups (t = 2.970, p < .05) at the end of the
experiment. The mean for the quality of the writing produced
by the experimental group (82.85) is larger than that of the
control group (74.50). That is, the participants in the experi-
mental group who were taught the sociocultural writing
strategies and practiced writing their essays utilizing these
strategies outperformed those in the control group, who had
not been explicitly taught these strategies. As a result, one
can come up with the conclusion that the strategy instruction
and context-providing scaffolding had a significant influence
on the quality of the writing the participants in the experi-
mental group produced.
Within-group improvement in writing quality was also
investigated through matched t-tests, which were run for
both groups. The obtained results are illustrated in Table 4.
As it can be seen in the table, both groups have improved
their writing quality at the end of the experiment, and the dif-
ference between the means of their scores on the first and the
last essays is statistically significant (t = 7.65, p < .001, for
the experimental group and t = 3.120, p < .05, for the control
group). To see how big the mean differences are, the effect
size for the differences between the writing scores for each
group was calculated. The results, as presented in Table 4,
show that the effect size for the control group is at a moder-
ate level, very close to the border between moderate and
small, while that of the experimental group enjoys a large
one (.33 and .75, respectively). This implies that receiving
strategies-based instruction and mediation through coopera-
tion seem to have more effect on the improvement of writing
quality than cooperative writing without having a conscious
knowledge of these strategies.
Research Question 2: To what extent do the students use
the instructed sociocultural strategies in their interac-
tions while working in groups?
The analysis of the transcripts of the recorded interactions
in the experimental group revealed that they used the major-
ity of the sociocultural strategies the teacher had taught,
while negotiating in different stages of the writing process.
Randomly selected pieces of discourse have been presented
below to exemplify the use of the selected strategies by the
students. It should be noted that, for the most part, students'
interactions were in Persian with English used occasionally
when referring to the different parts of the text written or
when reading parts of the text. To facilitate understanding,
the English version of the interactions has been produced and
presented in each section. The words said in English are
boldfaced. Note that letters at the beginning of each exchange
just replace the names of the students; neither do all similar
letters indicate the same students nor do they correspond to
Groups A, B, and C indicating the proficiency levels.

brainstorming.

The above-mentioned examples are just some of the strat-
egies the students in the experimental group used while writ-
ing their essays.
The transcripts of the interactions of the controlled group
just showed a very limited use of some of these strategies,
the most important ones being L1-mediated strategies and
L2-mediated strategy, which are usually used in such inter-
actions particularly when the correct language form is con-
cerned. This group, in spite of having the same resources at
their disposal, made a very limited use of the relevant strate-
gies or did not use them at all. For instance, although the
scoring scheme was introduced to both groups, since the
teacher did not teach evaluation-criteria-mediated strategies
to the control group, they did not refer to it in their interac-
tions while writing or revising their writing.
Discussion and Conclusion
The results of the present study showed that the experimental
group, who were taught the writing strategies within a socio-
cultural framework outperformed the students in the control
group in both strategy use and writing quality, although both
worked in groups. The findings are theoretically justified and
almost in line with most of the experimental studies that have
a sociocultural foundation, as the review of the literature
indicates.
Students in both groups formed small communities of
practice doing the writing tasks progressively, except that
those in the experimental group learned and used the writing
strategies during the course and achieved more growth in the
use of those strategies, and as a result, in writing quality, as
compared with the control group.
The strategies taught to the participants of the present
study were of mediational type. They were explicitly
introduced and used in class for the students to mediate their
writings in all the three phases of the writing process. This
type of teaching assumes a paradigm of teacher­student and
peer­peer interaction, while a strong emphasis is placed on
the active role of the learner as a strategy user, which is
essential for becoming a self-regulated learner (Vygotsky,
1978). The teacher in the experimental group wandered
round the class to ensure that the students used the strategies
taught, negotiating the strategies with the students when
needed. This negotiation is one of the vital factors in suc-
ceeding the mastery of the strategies and their implementa-
tion as well (Vygotsky, 1978). Some of these strategic
behaviors displayed by the peers and the teacher in this study
included intentionality, joint regard, affective involvement,
communicative ratchet, contingent responsivity, and so on,
which are all mostly among mediational process-related
strategies awareness of which were intended to be raised in
the experimental group along with the instruction of the
other sociocultural strategies.
One of the strategies that the students learned in class and
used while doing group work was articulation, which
involves any method of encouraging students to express their
knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving processes in
group work (Yang, 2011). In effect, the use of this strategy by
the students of the present study provides a likely explana-
tion for their higher use of revision strategies, which led to
writing essays of a higher quality in their later independent
writings. As a matter of fact, through articulation, students
are encouraged not only to make revisions but also to pro-
vide reasons for revisions to their peers in groups. Such tasks
require students to participate in generating language knowl-
edge and evaluating the writing outcomes. In reflection, stu-
dents compare their own problem-solving processes in
writing with those of their peers (Liu, 2005). Such compari-
sons aid students in diagnosing their difficulties, and adjust-
ing and negotiating their revision strategies until they achieve
the goal of text improvement. An exploration of this kind has
possibly enabled students to become more and more inde-
pendent learners in producing high quality essays, as they are
encouraged to select appropriate and effective peer review
for improving their own texts.
Another kind of strategy practiced in the experimental
group was time-mediated strategy, which has a basis from
some well-founded studies emphasizing the temporal nature
of composing. As with the group writing requirements, the
students had the choice to allocate different amounts of time
to negotiation while working collaboratively on different
parts of the task.
According to Cumming (2001), L2 writers "seem to devote
much attention and, as a result, much time, while they write to
make decisions about the form of the second language or to
finding resources such as appropriate words" (p. 5).
The participants of the study were also taught to assess their
writing regularly based on criteria that the teacher offered them
through feedbacks and the instruction on academic writing the
Rahimi and Noroozisiam 7
teacher gave them through the course. This strategy is catego-
rized under evaluation-criterion-mediated strategies (Lei,
2008), which is a subcategory of rule-mediated strategies.
Assessing writing and providing feedback is considered a
social practice in nature. In this research, part of this process
was fulfilled by the teacher and part of it by the students. In this
process, teachers' preliminary feedback to students' writings
served as an evaluation criterion to their future collaborative
tasks in class, which was done for both groups. They were pro-
vided with an insight into what good English writing is and
strove to meet the respective criteria for good writing.
The principles of peer feedback and collaboration are
clearly consistent with a social constructivist framework
(Peterson & McClay, 2010). Communication among the
teachers and the students is essential for effective assess-
ment, as Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) advocate an
emphasis on productive, supportive talk. Garcia-Mayo and
Pica (2000) claim that students can give each other useful
input. Ellis (2003) also indicates that during group work
exercises, students will provide each other with input that
promotes their comprehension better than the input provided
by the teacher, which is carefully planned beforehand.
Therefore, they, along with Gass (1988), suggest that effec-
tive input that facilitates language acquisition should be
comprehended input instead of a comprehensible input,
which emphasizes the importance of students' production by
which the actual level of students' understanding can be
gauged.
In addition, the participants of the study were taught to
mediate their writing through different artifacts such as the
Internet, dictionaries, English literary works, writing text-
books, and cognitive and organizational strategies instructed
by the teacher. The artifacts were many times introduced as
an effective strategy on its own to mediate the writing tasks.
For example, the Internet, which is one of the strategies
introduced in the class, is one of the fastest spreading tech-
nologies of communication in human history. Theorists from
many cognitive traditions (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978) have pointed
out that technologies (an example of artifacts) are not exter-
nal to human activity but rather intimately bound up with it.
All in all, the study explored how raising the students'
consciousness about the L2 writing strategies would help
them mediate their writing strategically in all the stages with
diverse resources in the dynamic context of the writing and,
as a result, improve the quality of their writing. To this end,
the activity system model provided a proper framework to
depict such a dynamic and cyclical process and to investigate
each component's relationship to the other. In the experimen-
tal group, the whole context with all its elements was taken
into consideration to improve the quality of the writings. The
result of the treatment proved to be successful as the rela-
tively large difference between the control and the experi-
mental group's performance revealed. As it is evidenced in
the study, there is also a perceptible change in the control
group. That is, although they were not taught how to use the
collaborative writing strategies, they still made a limited use
of some of these strategies, which can partly explain the
improvement observed in their writing ability. The great dif-
ference in effect size calculated for each group indicates the
experimental group outstandingly outperformed the control
group and that is attributed to the right and conscious utiliza-
tion of strategies within sociocultural approach. So it could
be concluded that the sociocultural strategies-based instruc-
tion has the desired effect on writing quality in case they are
explicitly introduced and practiced in the class.As Lei (2008,
p. 232) asserts,
One implication that L2 writing teachers can draw from
the study is that if students can raise their consciousness
about the mediation of resources in writing processes, they
might be able to strategically mediate their writing with a
multitude of resources, find the true meaning of writing, and
gradually develop themselves into better writers.
Suggestions for Further Research
With regard to the importance of learning style (defined as
the general approach students use to learn a new subject or
tackle a new problem) in group working, further research
should address the influence of style harmony and style con-
flict in collaborative writing activities.
Transition from other- to self-regulation has not proved to
be an easy task to accomplish (Rasku-Puttonen, Eteläpelto,
Arvaja, & Häkkinen, 2003), but scaffolding activities, in the
long run, might need less intervention on behalf of the
teacher and perhaps might trigger longer episodes of collec-
tive thinking on behalf of the students. A comprehensive
microanalysis of the nature of such transition, which finally
ends in individuals' self-regulation, would be very illuminat-
ing with regard to the concept of scaffolding, which needs to
be done in an extended period of time.
Further research can also concentrate on the use of these
strategies in different stages of writing--pre, while, and
revision--to see which one/ones are used more frequently in
different stages and why.
