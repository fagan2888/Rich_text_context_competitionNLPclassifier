Although recent studies suggest that 13% of young adults, including at least one-fourth of African Americans,
experience parental incarceration, little research has examined links between parental incarceration and physical
health. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1994­2008) and gender-based
theories of stress, the authors examined whether parental incarceration is associated with increased body mass
index among women but not men. Panel analysis spanning adolescence and adulthood, controlling for stressful life
events, internalizing behaviors, and a range of individual, familial, and neighborhood characteristics, reveals that
body mass index for women who have experienced parental incarceration is 0.49 units (P < 0.004) higher than that
for women whose parents have never been incarcerated. This association is not evident among men. Similarly, in
change score models between waves II and IV, women experiencing parental incarceration have a 0.92-unit
increase in body mass index (P < 0.026) relative to women who did not have a parent undergo incarceration. In
supplemental analysis examining if gender differences in incarceration stress response (externalizing vs. internalizing)
explain these findings, the authors found that obesity status moderates the relation between depression and
parental incarceration. Results suggest a stress internalization process that, for the first time, links parental
incarceration with obesity among women.

With the exponential rise in the US prison population,
parental incarceration has become an increasingly common
experience in US society. In 2007, 1.7 million children had
a parent incarcerated in state or federal prison, while nearly
7.5 million children had a parent either incarcerated or on
probation or parole (1, 2). Among young adults in the United
States, 13% report that their biologic father has spent time
in jail or prison, with mother/father incarceration becoming
an increasingly common life experience, particularly for
African-American children (3, 4). Wildeman (5) estimates
that 1 in 4 African Americans born in 1990 have experi-
enced a father's incarceration, compared with 1 in 25 whites.
The racial disparities in adult incarceration are reflected among
children: Black and Hispanic children are 7.5 and 2.5 times,
respectively, more likely to have an incarcerated parent
than are white children (1). With an incarceration rate that
is 5­10 times higher than that in other industrialized nations,
the United States is unique in its proportion of children
experiencing a parent undergo incarceration (4).
As an increasingly common life-course event among chil-
dren and young adults, parental incarceration has become the
focus of a growing body of research (6­10). Parental in-
carceration is linked to a number of problem behaviors and
poor outcomes, including aggression/misbehavior in early
childhood (11, 12), antisocial behavior/delinquency (12­16),
drug use (17, 18), mental health issues (17, 19­21), and poor
educational performance/outcomes (9, 20). These associations
result, in part, from additional risk factors that accompany
636 Am J Epidemiol. 2012;175(7):636­644
incarceration, including parental absence, lack of economic
resources, family instability, and strained parental relation-
ships; consequently, parental incarceration is considered
a major and long-term stressor in the lives of children (9, 17,
22­24). Furthermore, male and female children may dif-
ferentially express stress related to parental incarceration.
General stress research suggests that boys and men typically
externalize stressful life events like paternal incarceration
through actions such as delinquent behavior; in contrast, girls
and women generally internalize similar stressors through
mechanisms such as anxiety or depression (25­27). Although
most studies of parental incarceration do not separately ana-
lyze males and females (9), some findings are suggestive of
this pattern. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child
Wellbeing Study, Wildeman (11) found paternal incarceration
to be associated with increased risk of aggression among
young boys but with a decrease or ``protective effect'' for
aggression among young girls. In an Australian sample,
Kinner et al. (19) reported an association between paternal
incarceration and internalizing behavior among adolescent
girls but no association among boys.
The links among stress, internalizing behaviors, and sub-
sequent health among adolescent and adult women (28­34)
are well established. Thus, parental incarceration may, in
turn, also be associated with such physical health issues,
particularly among females, who internalize stress in lieu
of the aggression/delinquency commonly observed among
men. Recent work by Jackson et al. (33) and Mezuk et al.
(34) suggests that poor physical health behaviors may also
act as substitutes for mental health issues such as depres-
sion, similarly implicating obesity and other mental health
issues as alternative adverse outcomes to aggression and
delinquency.
Although stress theories and mental health outcomes have
been studied among children of incarcerated parents (9), the
lack of longitudinal studies examining long-term physical
health outcomes, such as obesity, is notable. The internali-
zation of stress, long-term association between parental in-
carceration and mental health issues reported by Murray and
Farrington (9), and engagement in poor physical health be-
haviors make it a potentially highly significant issue among
female children of incarcerated parents, both as an extension
of current research on the effects of parental incarceration
and in the context of high rates of parental incarceration
within the US population. As a growing epidemic in the
United States, an outcome frequently linked with internal-
ization of stress, and a precursor to major health problems
such as stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart
disease in later life, obesity represents a physical health mea-
sure with significant consequences with increasing age.
By examining the body mass index (BMI) of respondents
over a 12-year period that extends from adolescence into
adulthood, we examine how parental incarceration may result
in increases in body size over this critical developmental
period. We use a comprehensive set of statistical controls
that are believed to mediate or confound the association
between parental incarceration and BMI in a series of nested
regression models that are designed to account for the hypoth-
esized association. To test for robustness, we also compare
how changes in parental incarceration status are associated
with increased body mass for respondents interviewed at
waves II­IV and, to further eliminate other sources of un-
observed heterogeneity, we perform a comparable analysis
on a subset of respondents reporting parental incarceration
at some point during their lives. Finally, we explore the
mechanism for this association by examining the influence
of parental incarceration on changes in depressive symptoms
among obese and nonobese women. If increased BMI is due
to overeating as a means to cope with stress, then the in-
fluence of this stressful life event should be notably weaker
among obese women than among nonobese women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
We used 4 waves of in-home data collection from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (hereafter
referred to as ``Add Health''). Information on how to obtain
the Add Health data files is available on the Add Health
website (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth).
The Add Health in-home sample consists of 20,700
respondents enrolled in grades 7­12 at wave I during
1994­1995. Follow-up interviews were conducted in 1996,
2001­2002, and 2007­2008, with approximately 14,700
(71%), 15,200 (73%), and 15,700 (75.5%) respondents com-
pleting interviews at waves II, III, and IV, respectively.
Answers to sensitive questions in Add Health, including
youth offending and arrest, were obtained by using audio-
computer­assisted self-interviewing (known as ``audio-CASI'')
technology to increase the reliability of self-reports (35).
For this study, we examined 15,558 individuals who had
completed interviews for all waves of the study. In our sample,
1,205 males and 1,472 females reported that their biologic
mother or father was incarcerated, including 242 male and
306 female respondents who reported that a parent was in-
carcerated between waves II and IV. Because of variation in
BMI arising from pregnancy, we eliminated female respon-
dents who reported being recently or currently pregnant.
We used multiple-imputation techniques for missing values
(36, 37) by use of the ``ice'' procedure in Stata software (38)
across 50 imputed data sets to increase the reliability and
statistical power of imputations (39). To make use of these
imputed data, we used the Stata add-on ``mim'' in conjunc-
tion with regression analysis (40). To examine the reliability
of our imputations, we compared the results presented below
with results from the subset of observations with no missing
data. Although we found that estimating the full sample
yielded biased results, imputations that were restricted to
the subsample of 1) observations with no missing internalizing/
externalizing behaviors and 2) cases in which respondents
completed interviews yielded reliable and consistent re-
sults. In our panel analysis, we use imputations from this
subsample.
Because interactions can bias imputations (36) and to
demonstrate robustness of findings, we present results for
change models that include only cases with complete data
for change score models presented in Tables 1 and 2. For
change score models, we present results for all respondents.
As a robustness check for unobserved heterogeneity, we

also report results for the subpopulation of respondents who
reported that their biologic father was incarcerated prior to
wave IV.
Key measures
Tables 3 and 4 provide a description of constructed mea-
sures; Table 3 also presents means and standard deviations.
In the following subsections, we discuss key variables used in
the analyses.
Body mass index. BMI, derived from the respondent's
weight (kg)/height (m)2, is a metric used in research as an
approximation of a respondent's body fat. Add Health col-
lected self-reported weight and height at wave I but inter-
viewer-assessed weight and height at waves II­IV. Although
measured BMI is preferred in research, prior research exam-
ining BMI among Add Health respondents has shown that
self-reported BMI at wave I yields results that are consistent
with those at later waves (41). In Table 5, we differentiate
between obese and nonobese women using a standard BMI
threshold of 30 (42).
Parental incarceration. Parental incarceration is measured
by the respondent's retrospective reports at wave IV. Reports
at this wave are the first to provide the age at which the
respondents recalled their mother and/or father being incarcer-
ated. During interviews, respondents were first asked, ``Has
your biological mother/father ever spent time in jail or
prison?'' If respondents noted, ``yes,'' they were then asked,
``How old were you when your biological mother/father
went to jail or prison (the first time)?'' Responses range
from ``not yet born'' through ``31 years.'' Cases in which
respondents either refused to answer these questions or in-
dicated no knowledge of their mother's/father's incarceration
are coded as missing. To adjust for the various methods
used in analysis, we coded timing of parental incarceration
in 2 ways. To investigate parental incarceration in panels, we
used an indicator variable to denote whether either parent had
undergone incarceration. Alternatively, for fixed-effect models,
we investigated parental incarceration occurring between
waves II and IV. We also report results from models for panel
data that examine only respondents whose parents completed
incarceration prior to wave I (these data are not shown).

Internalizing/externalizing and unhealthy behaviors. To
determine the extent to which associations between parental
incarceration and obesity may be explained by internalizing/
externalizing behaviors, stress, and unhealthy behaviors/
lifestyles, we also added several additional measures listed
in Table 4. In longitudinal analysis, our measures include
1) the proportion of all stressful life events a respondent
experienced at each wave, 2) 4-wave measures of depression
and suicidal thoughts to assess internalization, and 3) 4-wave
measures of sedentary behavior, fast food consumption, and
soft drink consumption to capture maladaptive behaviors that
may substitute for internalization. In change score models,
we examined onset of arrest, increase in depression, increase
in suicidal thoughts, and an increase in stressful life events
to explore potential internalizing/externalizing pathways.

Measure Descriptiona Mechanism
Stressful life
events
Stressful life events experienced by the respondent in the 12 months prior to the interview.
As a guideline, we used the stressful life events list found in the reports by Adkins
et al. (47) and Boardman and Alexander (48) and identified the following occurrences of
stress: ran away from home, was expelled from school, had an unwanted pregnancy,
had an abortion, gave baby up for adoption, cohabitation ended, romantic relationship
ended, marriage ended, nonromantic sexual relationship ended, diagnosed with STD,
attempted suicide, threatened someone, shot or stabbed someone, injured someone in
a fight, was discharged from the military, entered the military, was evicted from home,
utility service was cut off, receiving welfare, involuntarily cut from welfare, juvenile
conviction or detention, adult conviction, adult jail time, had a miscarriage, biologic
father died, biologic mother died, parental figure died, romantic relationship partner died,
spouse died, baby died, friend or family member committed suicide, baby had medical
problems, relationship abuse (threatening, insulting, swearing, throwing things, pushing),
was jumped, saw violence, was shot or stabbed, had sex for money, was threatened,
mother or father is on public assistance, was raped, was injured in a fight, skipped
needed health care.
As recent ethnographic work
suggests, parental
incarceration is associated
with a number of long-term
stressful life events, and
parental incarceration may
act as a ``marker'' for
experiencing many
stressful life events, which
would explain the
association between
parental incarceration and
obesity/BMI.
Depression Five-item depression scale based on that of Perreira et al. (49) for Add Health measures
found to be reliable and consistent across racial/ethnic groups. The questions assess
the respondent's frequency of particular emotions during the past week, including
being happy/satisfied with life,b feeling depressed, being unable to shake off the blues,
being happy, and feeling sad. The adjusted Cronbach's alpha was 0.80 at wave I,
0.79 at wave II, 0.85 at wave III, and 0.84 at wave IV. Psychiatric diagnoses are not
available in Add Health.
With the strong correlation
between depression and
obesity/BMI among
women, depression may
be higher among females
who have experienced
parental incarceration.
Suicidal
thoughts
Self-report at each wave indicating whether the respondent considered suicide or had
suicidal thoughts in the 12 months prior to the interviews.
Suicidal thoughts are used
as a measure of
internalizing behaviors.
Average no. of
sedentary
behaviors
per day
Average number of hours per day that the respondent was engaged in sedentary behaviors.
At waves I­III, these behaviors were the sum of hours spent watching television, playing
computer or video games, and watching videos. At wave IV, these measures were the
number of hours spent watching television, playing video or computer games, and time
spent at a computer.
Measures whether increased
BMI associated with
parental incarceration may
result from increased
sedentary behaviors.
Fast food
consumption
Average number of days per week that the respondent ate fast food at
wave IV interviews.
Measure capturing whether
children of incarcerated
parents may cope with
stressors through
unhealthy dietary patterns.
Consumption
of soft drinks
Indicator variable for whether the respondent had consumed soft drinks in the
week prior to the interview at wave IV.
Measure capturing whether
children of incarcerated
parents may cope with
stressors through
unhealthy dietary patterns.

b At waves I, III, and IV, respondents were asked how happy about life they were during the last 7 days. Unfortunately, this item was not queried
at wave II, so we substituted a similar measure that asked how satisfied respondents felt about their lives. The mean and standard deviation of this
substituted variable are similar to those for the ``happy'' items used at the other 3 waves and yielded results that are comparable to those from other
waves in cross-sectional analyses.

All analyses were conducted by using Stata, version 11.1,
statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Table 5 contains the mean BMI by gender and parental
incarceration status for all 4 waves of the Add Health Study.
As indicated in this table, the average effect of incarceration
is 0.44 BMI units across all waves, and parental incarcera-
tion is positively associated with higher BMI for each of the
4 waves of the study. Importantly, the effects are evident
among women only. At wave I, we show an average differ-
ence of ~0.75 BMI units for women who have had a parent
go to jail, compared with those who have not. For a woman
170 cm tall and weighing 68 kg, this translates to a 2.3-kg
weight increase. By wave IV, the average BMI difference
is ~1.3 BMI units. For the same 170-cm woman, this trans-
lates to a 4.1-kg increase, compared with those who have
not had a parent incarcerated. On average, we observed an
unadjusted difference of 0.88 BMI units for women whose
parents had been incarcerated compared with those whose
parents had never been incarcerated.
Random-intercept models
Table 1 presents a series of nested regression models that
add successive blocks of mediating variables to examine
the social and behavioral mechanisms that may account for
the patterns observed in Table 5. For parsimony, we provide
only the effect of parental incarceration on BMI; for full
results for models 1­5, refer to Web Tables 1­3, respectively,
for all respondents, males, and females, posted on the Journal's
website (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). The first 4 models
are random-intercept models in which 4 observations are
nested within individuals. For both the full sample and women,
the inclusion of basic sociodemographic controls (model 1)
significantly attenuated the association observed in Table 5,
but parental incarceration remains a highly significant pre-
dictor of BMI; sociodemographic factors account for roughly
32% of the association between parental incarceration and
BMI. Similarly, as shown in models 2­4, statistical controls

for alternative risks, stressful life events, and differential
health lifestyles account for only a small amount of the
remaining association (~18%). After we adjusted for these
factors, parental incarceration was associated with a ~0.49-unit
increase (P < 0.004) in BMI for women (model 4). As
a robustness check, in comparing those who experienced
parental incarceration prior to wave I with those never ex-
periencing parental incarceration, we found nearly identical
results; for example, we observed a 0.43-unit increase in
BMI for women experiencing parental incarceration prior
to wave I (P < 0.003) using model 4 of Table 1.
In supplemental analyses (available on request), we also
estimated the relation between parental incarceration and
respondents' meeting official classifications for obesity, using
comparable longitudinal models presented in models 1­4 of
Table 1. In the baseline model, parental incarceration is
associated with a 29.6% and 40.9% increase in the risk of
obesity for all respondents and women, respectively; there
is no significant association between parental incarceration
and obesity among males.
Change score models
To derive more refined estimates of the influence of paren-
tal incarceration on BMI, we examined change in BMI from
wave II to wave IV (in which measured BMI is available and
provides a large-enough window to assess change) as a func-
tion of parental incarceration during that same period. This
model includes the full set of controls, changes in the control
variables, and a control for BMI at wave II (model 5 of
Table 1). According to this model, women whose parents
were incarcerated between waves II and IV (n ¼ 194) saw
BMI increases that were 0.92 units higher than those of
women whose parents were not arrested during this period.
As a final check of robustness to rule out other sources of
unobserved heterogeneity, we also reran model 5, comparing
respondents whose father was arrested during the wave II­IV
period with respondents whose father was arrested prior to
wave II; the results were substantively identical (b ¼ 1.25)
and statistically significant (P < 0.05, 1-tailed test). In other
words, this association does not appear to be due to unob-
served characteristics that affect both the risk of parental
incarceration and the risk of BMI.
In Table 2, to examine the mechanism responsible for
the observed association between parental incarceration
and BMI and the notable gender differences in this associ-
ation, we considered the gendered process of internalizing
stress by estimating the effect of parental incarceration on
change in depression levels from wave II to wave IV. Our
models control for stressful life events and changes in them
from wave II to wave IV that may confound the association
between parental incarceration and mental health. The first
model examines this association among men. As the gen-
dered-internalization perspective anticipates, parental incar-
ceration does not significantly influence the mental health of
men (b ¼ 0.114; not significant). However, this same model
indicates a fairly robust and deleterious influence of parental
incarceration on the mental health of women (b ¼ 0.576;
P < 0.01). Results from interaction models suggest that the
gender difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05, one-
tailed test). We then examined this association among women
as a function of wave IVobesity status and showed a stronger
effect among nonobese women (b ¼ 0.829; P < 0.01) and
a nonsignificant effect among obese women (b ¼ 0.381; not
significant). That is, obesity appears to mute the mental health
consequences of parental incarceration for women and remains
an alternative coping mechanism that may help to explain
the mechanism by which parental incarceration influences
BMI levels for young women.
Sensitivity analyses
To evaluate the robustness of findings, we conducted sen-
sitivity analysis on the models and methods used in the anal-
yses (data not shown). For parental incarceration, we found
no substantive variation by parent's sex (i.e., mother's and
father's incarceration), age of respondent (e.g., parental in-
carceration before age 10), or incarceration prior to wave I.
In alternative methods, we found that parental incarceration
significantly predicted increased BMI using multilevel models
that controlled for school clustering and cross-sectional anal-
ysis that made use of Add Health's multistage weights. In
interaction models, we found that the effect of parental in-
carceration did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity, age, or
parental education.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we linked parental incarceration to increases
in body mass among a national sample of American youth.
By controlling for a comprehensive array of stressful life
events, detailed information about family structure and socio-
economic status, father closeness, neighborhood poverty,
respondent low self-control, and internalizing/externalizing
behaviors, we are able to demonstrate a significant, in-
dependent influence of parental incarceration on the BMI
and obesity for young women. Additionally, our results from
change models support research suggesting that parental
incarceration leads to increased BMI through internalizing/
externalizing behaviors. Parental incarceration is associated
with increased depression among women who are not obese,
but it is nonsignificantly associated with depression among
all men and among women who are obese. The gender differ-
ences that we observe are in line with gender-based theories
of internalizing/externalizing behaviors in the general health
literature (25­27), research linking internalization with obesity
(28­32), and research on the effects of parental incarceration
(11, 19). Thus, we find parental incarceration to be a risk
factor for increased obesity among women and a potential
alternative to internalizing behaviors such as depression.
Given the gender and internalizing/externalizing dif-
ferences observed in our research, links between parental
incarceration and long-term physical health outcomes, such
as obesity, should be a focus of increased research. Instead
of simply being added risk factors, obesity and elevated
BMI are consistently observed among women who do not
display internalizing behaviors. Given the many risks as-
sociated with parental incarceration and recent research sug-
gesting that children of incarcerated parents suffer adversity
642 Roettger and Boardman
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;175(7):636­644
in adolescence and young adulthood (17), our research
suggests the need to consider how individuals may differ-
entially respond to the stresses of incarceration and related
disadvantages.
We believe that this association is particularly important
for African-American women, who are more likely than non-
Hispanic white women to express this internalization through
high caloric intake and sedentary lifestyles (33, 34). According
to recent estimates, the median BMI for non-Hispanic white
women aged 20­39 years is 24.5, compared with 29.4 for
African-American women aged 20­39 years (44). Thus, the
0.9-unit increase in BMI for women who have had a parent
incarcerated is equivalent to 18.4% of the existing disparity
(4.9 BMI units). Because at least one-fourth of African-
American children entering adulthood are raised in families
in which the father has spent time in prison (4), this stressful
life event may uniquely contribute to obesity disparities be-
tween black women and white women. Similarly, given the
characterization of the exponential increase in obesity among
black women as rooted in a stress-coping process (33, 34),
future research examining how women respond to the stresses
of parental incarceration may yield insights into racial dis-
parities in obesity.
Several limitations should be considered in the interpre-
tation of the results of our study. First, we have fairly limited
information about the specific timing of incarceration, the
duration of incarceration, and parental criminality that may
clarify the links between parental incarceration and BMI.
Future research should explore these associations as a func-
tion of the type of crime committed, the occurrence of the
event within the criminal history of the parent, and the specific
developmental periods of the child's life in which a parent
was absent because of incarceration. Second, we emphasized
gender differences in the association between parental in-
carceration and BMI, but age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, religiosity, and other important sociodemographic
factors may also moderate the effects of stress on body mass.
Future research should explore these possibilities. Finally,
we emphasize one particular health outcome when, in fact,
parental incarceration is linked to behavioral problems
(11­16) and health behavior problems such as drug use
(17, 18). An important next step would be to characterize
the influence of parental incarceration on the comorbidity
of health, risky behaviors, and education (20). If parental
incarceration affects this broad range of outcomes in unique
yet predictable ways, then interventions should be developed
to provide this specific at-risk population with effective
mechanisms to reduce the deleterious health influences of
parental incarceration.
