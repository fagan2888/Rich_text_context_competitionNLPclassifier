Abstract
HIV risk remains high among Cambodian female entertainment and sex workers, driven by amphetamine-type substance
use and sexual risk. Conditional cash transfer is an evidence-based approach to reduce stimulant use and optimize
HIV/AIDS prevention, but questions remain regarding implementation in resource-limited settings. We conducted
formative qualitative research to enhance acceptability of a conditional cash transfer intervention aimed at reducing
amphetamine-type substance use and HIV risk among female entertainment/sex workers and inform implementation
as part of a large cluster randomized trial. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 female entertainment/sex
workers. Interviews were digitally recorded and conducted and transcribed in Khmer. English transcripts were read
for emerging themes and an initial coding scheme was developed. Data were coded using open and axial coding to
clarify and consolidate initial themes. While most participants expressed enthusiasm for the intervention, financial
and transportation issues emerged as key barriers to participation. The proposed incentive of USD$1 per screen was
regarded as unacceptable and participants identified a need for transportation assistance. Participants also expressed
concerns about directly observed urine specimen collection. Finally, while most participants found the 4-week aftercare
program acceptable, the need for enjoyable as well as educational content was emphasized. Revisions to the protocol
taking these data into account were made to optimize the acceptability of the intervention and the implementation of
the trial. Findings identified key concerns and preferences that were taken into account in the final trial protocol. In
particular, financial and transportation issues were identified as critical barriers to participation, with the potential to
impact both intervention uptake and trial feasibility. Results demonstrate the value of formative qualitative research
for clinical trial planning and implementation, particularly in settings where little is known about acceptability of
interventions or willingness to participate.

Introduction
An estimated 0.8% of the adult population in Cambodia is
living with HIV. A key driver of the epidemic is transactional
sex work. In epidemiological studies, prevalence among
female sex workers, referred to in Cambodia as female enter-
tainment and sex workers (FESW), has ranged from 15.5%
to 23%, with HIV incidence between 1.2% and 3.5% (Page
et al., 2013). A significant proportion (26%) of FESW also
use illicit drugs, principally amphetamine-type stimulants
(ATS) which are associated with increased risk of HIV and
other sexually transmitted infections (STI) in this setting
(Couture et al., 2011, 2012). No HIV prevention interven-
tions in Cambodia currently target ATS use among FESW,
and there is a need for novel approaches which target ATS
use as a driver of the epidemic in FESW in Cambodia and
other resource-limited settings.
Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs provide tangi-
ble rewards as positive reinforcement for the achievement of
specific behavioral goals and have been used to impact a
range of health outcomes including infant mortality, child
health and nutrition, tuberculosis, immunization, and HIV
risk (Baird et al., 2012; Boccia et al., 2011; Fernald et al.,
2008; Rasella et al., 2013; Topp et al., 2013; Todd and
Winters, 2011; Victora et al., 2011). CCT approaches have
been shown to mitigate the negative effects of structural fac-
tors, such as food insecurity and poverty, on health outcomes
(Forde et al., 2011). In the drug treatment field, an extensive
literature has examined the efficacy of contingency manage-
ment, an evidence-based form of CCT where individuals
receive escalating financial reinforcement for abstinence.
Founded on behavioral economics, contingency manage-
ment yields clinically meaningful, short-term reductions in
stimulant use and has been utilized to promote HIV-related
health behavior change among drug users (Crawford and
Vlahov, 2010; Haug and Sorensen, 2006; Higgins et al.,
2012; Prendergast et al., 2006; Sorensen et al., 2007). CCT
programs for stimulant users have shown that these short-
term reductions in stimulant use promote enhanced retention
in other drug treatments and better overall treatment out-
comes (Lee and Rawson, 2008; Prendergast et al., 2006;
Rawson et al., 2002, 2006; Shoptaw et al., 2006).
The Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention
Implementation (CIPI) program includes the following inter-
vention components: (1) a 12-week, CCT intervention where
women complete thrice-weekly urine screening visits and
receive small financial incentives for ATS abstinence fol-
lowed by (2) a four-session cognitive-behavioral aftercare
group for those who attend at least half (>18) of the CCT
urine screening visits. The CIPI program also includes a
microfinance opportunity consisting of financial literacy
training and the possibility to apply for small business loans
for women who do not use ATS or those who complete the
CCT plus aftercare intervention with confirmed abstinence.
CIPI is utilizing an implementation science approach to
evaluate this evidence-based intervention to reduce ATS and
HIV risk among FESW using a cluster randomized stepped-
wedge trial design. The trial involves the sequential rollout in
10 Cambodian provinces of a 16-week program that com-
bines the 12-week CCT program with a 4-week group-based
aftercare program (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01835574).
Previous research shows that formative research can sup-
port intervention development and clinical trial design and
implementation through improved understanding of the
mechanisms and effects of interventions by exploring the
attitudes of target groups, identifying barriers to trial partici-
pation and intervention uptake, improving ethical informed
consent, and informing intervention design and evaluation
(Institute of Medicine, 2008; Oakley et al., 2006; Riley et al.,
2005; Tolley and Severy, 2006). Qualitative research meth-
ods, with their capacity to identify and describe beliefs and
practices, are especially useful in providing specific, con-
crete understandings of particular groups or settings and in
exploring complex beliefs and attitudes about the acceptabil-
ity and feasibility of particular programs or interventions.
These attributes mean that qualitative methods are well
suited to formative research designed to inform more effec-
tive interventions and enhance evaluations of their efficacy.
However, studies reporting the impact of qualitative data in
informing interventions and shaping implementation in the
context of clinical trials remain rare. The goal of this qualita-
tive study was to inform the content, implementation, and
evaluation of the proposed intervention by assessing accept-
ability and feasibility among ATS-using FESW, focusing on
barriers and facilitators to engagement in CCT and percep-
tions of potential aftercare components.
Methods
Adaptation of the CCT and cognitive-behavioral aftercare
intervention was informed by the Assessment, Decision,
Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration,
Training, and Testing (ADAPT-ITT) model for modifying or
tailoring evidence-based HIV interventions for new target
populations while remaining consistent to the core elements
and internal logic of the prototype work (Wingood and
DiClemente, 2008). Consistent with the ADAPT-ITT model,
the process of adaptation was iterative and the development
phase for the trial was informed by qualitative research with
the target population, FESW who use ATS. This article
describes the processes and results of the formative phase of
the adaptation of the intervention, including consultation on
key elements, activities, attributes, and delivery methods.
During 2013, we conducted in-depth interviews with
FESW (n=30) in five provinces. Eligibility criteria were that
participants were aged at least 18years, biologically female,
understood spoken Khmer, used SMARTgirl (SG) services
operated by our Cambodian partner FHI360, and reported
both ATS use and at least two sexual partners in the last
month. SG is the most widely disseminated HIV prevention
Dixon et al. 3
program in Cambodia aimed at FESW. It was implemented
nationally in 2009 as a social marketing health promotion
program aimed at women working in the high-risk entertain-
ment sector. SG uses a "club" recruitment system and tar-
geted communication tools to promote use of health
information and referrals for HIV testing, STI, and reproduc-
tive health services. In each locale where SG is implemented,
local non-governmental organizations (NGO) are the facili-
tators (FHI 360, 2015). In order to minimize potential issues
of access and trust, participants for the study were recruited
through neighbourhood- and venue-based outreach by SG
program staff. Following verbal informed consent, women
were interviewed at SG program offices in each province.
Interviews were conducted in Khmer by trained interviewers
and took between 30 minutes and 2 hours to complete.
Participants were remunerated with a USD$3 phone card and
provided with transportation assistance.
Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verba-
tim in Khmer. Transcripts were checked for accuracy against
the original recordings before being translated into English
by a certified translator. Following the general tenets and
principles of grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin, 1990),
we analyzed the data using an inductive approach. Interview
narratives were scrutinized and emerging themes discussed
and refined to develop an initial coding scheme. Data were
formally coded using both open and axial coding to clarify
and consolidate initial themes (Ezzy, 2002). The Cambodian
National Ethics Committee and the University of California
San Francisco Institutional Review Board provided ethical
approval for the study.
Results
Participants'accounts identified three key barriers and facili-
tators to CCT: the amount of financial remuneration for the
multiple visits, the need for transportation assistance to
attend the visits, and issues regarding urine toxicology
screening. Women also provided feedback on potential com-
ponents of the aftercare program.
CCT intervention
CCT interventions provide opportunities for behavioral
change by incentivizing, enabling, and empowering par-
ticipants and have been shown to be effective in increas-
ing healthy behaviors among vulnerable populations in
low- and middle-income countries (Baird et al., 2012). As
well as providing a source of short-term income, CCT
programs can facilitate the first and often most difficult
steps toward lasting health and lifestyle changes. CCT or
the use of financial incentives may also help to reduce
barriers to healthcare among marginalized populations by
addressing indirect and opportunity costs (Ranganathan
and Lagarde, 2012).
Our previous research identified occupational functional-
ity as an important determinant of ATS use among sex work-
ers in Cambodia (Maher et al., 2011). ATS was described as
a "power drug" (thnam kam-lang) which allowed women to
work long hours and increase their income by seeing more
clients but increased their risk of STI (Couture et al., 2012).
By providing women with income support to compensate for
reduced working hours, CCT interventions have the potential
to mitigate occupational ATS use.
While the idea of an intervention that paid women to
reduce or refrain from using drugs was initially met with sur-
prise, participants understood the concept and the potential
for cash incentives to reduce the occupational use of ATS.
However, there were concerns that not all FESW would par-
ticipate in such a program, particularly those who were
"addicted," raising the potential for selection bias:
[Do you think this amount [USD$84] can have an impact on
their decision to reduce their drug abuse within 12 weeks?] It
can. Yes, but only those who are not so addicted can get it. But
if they are so addicted it is difficult. (Chorvy, 22-year-old
woman)
I think that for some it is possible. For others, I dare not say.
[Why?] For those who are so addicted, I dare not say. In my area,
even their child was sold at 700 or 800 dollars and they did not
use the money to run any business but to buy drugs. (Haratey,
24-year-old woman)
Our original proposal for the intervention was a 12-week
program in which participants, who were required to attend
three urine screens weekly, would receive USD$1 cash if they
tested negative for recent ATS use. Women who provided
three negative screens in 1
week would receive weekly
bonuses of USD$4, USD$6, and USD$8 for weeks 1­4, 5­8,
and 9­12, respectively. The total maximum amount over the
12-week program was USD$84. Almost all women felt
strongly that USD$1 per visit was too small to be attractive to
FESW. Because many women could earn substantially more
from sex work, participants felt that the proposed incentive
was likely to attract only very poor FESW:
[T]his amount of money [$USD 1] could not be enough for them
to eat, just like how much is one box of rice? One box of rice
costs six thousand [riel] already, three thousand riel each and
how about paying for motorbike-taxi and water fee? So it could
not be enough for them. (Chorphum, 30-year-old woman)
Most participants felt that the minimum acceptable
amount per visit would be USD$2­USD$3 per day. This
would mean that women could potentially earn US$14­
US$18 per week with the bonuses:
About two or three dollars they could buy something to eat.
Don't give them too much as they may buy drugs. (Leahkhena,
29-year-old woman)
4 Methodological Innovations
However, some women felt that women should receive
US$5 or more per visit:
Maybe five dollars or they would think that this would waste
their time ... They think it wastes their time for sleep and wastes
their time for travel. But for me, I don't think so. I think that [it's
not] a waste of time because we travel for our health. (Sophary,
36-year-old woman)
Some participants felt that for women who were moti-
vated to stop using ATS, the escalating schedule of weekly
bonuses made the program more acceptable:
I believe they want it because not only this one dollar. If in this
one week the results for the three tests are negative, they can get
five dollars. (Viriya, 23-year-old woman)
One dollar is not much but it's just that we think we will get
much more in the future. As you said one dollar is little but when
we stop it for a long time, we get 84 dollars then we feel happy.
It's nearly 100 too. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old woman)
In short, this one dollar could not [make them] reduce it, but
what's most important is the bonus ... Yes, I think the bonus
could. (Sohpa, 32-year-old woman)
The data indicated that the proposed incentive of US$1
per negative urine toxicology result would be unlikely to
attract a representative sample of FESW. Along with heavy
ATS users, participants suggested that younger women and
women working in entertainment venues would also require
higher incentives to participate. FESW felt strongly that if
the incentive was set too low, the cost of participation would
be higher for women who continue to use ATS as this group
would earn less (because they will test positive for ATS) but
still need to pay for their transport costs and commit the same
amount of time attending urine screening. From a trial per-
spective, this could potentially lead to differential attrition
with FESW who continue to use ATS being more likely to be
lost to follow-up. In response to these data, we raised the
base incentive to USD$2 for each negative urine screen and
the weekly bonuses to USD$8, USD$10, and USD$12 for
weeks 1­4, 5­8, and 9­12, respectively.
However, most women also indicated that they would not
be prepared to attend the CCT program if their transportation
costs were not covered:
[What do you think about this one dollar?] Think that it is little.
Yes, this amount will be all spent for motorbike-taxi to come to
meet you. This is for a near place but how about the place so far
away? If you come to pick me up back and forth it will be okay.
(Phavy, 20-year-old woman)
[I]f I am far away, I refuse it. I'd say that one dollar is impossible.
[So how much would be possible?] Two dollars. [Two dollars
including the travel expense?] Yes. It's also good for two dollars.
I'm afraid that if we give just one dollar, they would criticize it.
(Phany, 19-year-old woman)
These data suggested that the proposed incentive payment
of USD$1 would not be sufficient to incentivize women to
reduce their ATS use and cover the costs of their transporta-
tion to the program:
We just get one dollar after the test. If it [ATS] is found, the
money is not given and if it is not found, we get only one dollar
which is even not enough for motorbike-taxi. (Ratana, 20-year-
old woman)
In response, we revised the trial protocol to include either
USD$2 travel reimbursement for those who arranged their
own transportation or the option of being transported to visits
by outreach staff who then received the USD$2.
Urine toxicology screening
The majority of participants expressed concerns about speci-
men provision. Almost all women indicated they would be
unwilling to provide a specimen under direct observation as
required by the original draft protocol. Women suggested
several alternatives, including using a curtain or a modesty
screen below the waist:
We need some concealment as well and women shall not be so
nude shamelessly ... If they ask to take our urine they have a can
to store urine. In short, for the test if they don't get in we go to
the bathroom alone. [And if the female staff stands in front of
the room, is it okay?] If she stands in front of the room that's
okay. (Srey Neang, 27-year-old woman)
Let's say, [I] feel shy when someone enters the bathroom with
me, feel shy. [For instance, if you get in, I turn my face, don't
look at you, how do you feel?] No problem for that. [But if you
get in, for example, the whole curtain is placed to hide you in
the bathroom, but I just stand outside of the curtain in the same
bathroom, how does it feel?] No problem if nothing can be
seen as it is hidden with the curtain. (Chorvy, 22-year-old
woman)
While a solution to this privacy issue would have been to
use tamper-resistant (heat-coded) specimen collection con-
tainers, the project budget did not allow for this. However, in
response to the data, we obviated the need for direct observa-
tion during specimen collection using a Specimen Validity
Test on each sample to check for adulteration prior to
testing.
Women were also asked about preferences for the loca-
tion and timing of urine toxicology screening. In relation to
the location, because the interviewees were recruited by, and
familiar with, their local SG club, almost all participants
nominated this as the most acceptable location for urine
screening:
I think it is good at the [SMARTgirl] club. Coming to the club
may help us release stress, feeling refreshed. [Why?] I once
came here and had fun and had blood test something like this.
(Phany, 19-year-old woman)
Dixon et al. 5
[Where should we come for a test?] It's okay to come to our
club, let's go. [SMARTgirl Club?] Yes, we have a meeting room
as normal like before. (Leahkhena, 29-year-old woman)
Views about the most suitable times for specimen collec-
tion were mixed. Approximately half the women felt that the
most acceptable time to present for urine screening was in
the morning:
Coming in the morning is better perhaps around eight or nine
o'clock as we are afraid that in the daytime women would be
busy. (Chakriya, 25-year-old woman)
The other half of the sample felt that the afternoon and, in
particular, the early afternoon was the most acceptable time:
We work at night, we feel sleepy ... If we make the appointment
before 2pm, we feel rather exhausted. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old
woman)
In response, we amended the trial protocol to provide for
urine testing on a drop-in basis between 8
a.m. and 5
p.m.
daily. Participants can choose between two schedules:
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; or Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday. Given the clear preference for SG clubs, we pro-
ceeded with our original plan to conduct urine screening at
these locations. In some provinces, once the trial was under-
way, it became apparent that women who anticipated posi-
tive results often failed to present for testing (~10%­15%).
In these cases, SG outreach workers conducted home visits
to collect the specimen.
Aftercare program
Participants were asked what they would like to see featured
in the weekly aftercare sessions. Women expressed a desire
to receive information or education about drug use and sex-
ual/reproductive health:
The topic on education about reduction of addictive substances.
[What else? What other activities?] And education about
women's health, birth spacing and blood testing for HIV [and]
sexually transmitted diseases. (Haratey, 24-year-old woman)
However, there were some concerns that not all FESW
would be interested in this type of educational content:
[Do you think if they raise a topic about the reasons why women
start to use drugs for discussion in our after-care group?] Some
don't like to listen. [Why?] Because of feeling bored ... [So
what do you think it is good or not if we include it?] Maybe it is
not possible because they don't listen to it. (Chamnan, 27-year-
old woman)
Participants also identified a need for practical skills and
strategies to avoid using ATS with friends, partners, and cli-
ents (Maher et al., 2013):
I think that if we can stop it we have to say no, [we have to be
able to] answer that we don't want. (Phavy, 20-year-old woman)
Refusal skills were identified as particularly important in
the context of relationships with partners and clients who use
ATS:
Because I think that first they want to say it too but don't dare to.
So when they get that help and motivation, they dare to say it,
dare to say no with guests. Dare to say no to drug use. "If you
want to do that [have sex] with me, I can, but if you want to use
[drugs], do so alone." [Do you think this skill is useful for
them?] I think it's useful for them. It helps them to be brave ...
They dare to say [no], dare to object to it without being afraid.
(Haratey, 24-year-old woman)
Some women emphasized the need for strategies for deal-
ing with stress and/or anger in the aftercare component:
As for my feeling, sometimes I also feel bad-tempered ... when
we don't use it, we feel like this. [So if I teach them how to
manage anger, do you think it is important for our program in the
fourth month or not?] It's important because most of them get
more and more angry. (Chorphum, 30-year-old woman)
While there was some receptivity to the idea of including
meditation exercises in the aftercare component, many par-
ticipants felt this would be unsuitable for most women, par-
ticularly those still using ATS:
Some may get bored. [Why?] Because they can't stay still. They
smoke drugs, let's say, today you come to examine their urine,
they smoked drugs last night, but the drugs' effects are not gone
immediately. Its effect may somewhat remain. When it is quiet,
they get bored. (Ratana, 20-year-old woman)
There were also some concerns that meditation was too
traditional, especially for younger women:
It's [meditation] too traditional. [So what should we do to avoid
being too traditional?] As I said, we do it like having fun in the
program such as lucky draw for prizes or buffet and then we talk
to them ... I think that it's me who has to concentrate my feeling.
If you tell me to concentrate my feeling I can't do it because it's
my feeling. It may explode and I will die. I bang my head against
the wall [laughter]. (Morokoth, 18-year-old woman)
While this may indicate a lack of understanding of the
goals of meditation, several women expressed a fear of
"thinking too much" (kit chreon). This is consistent with
Khmer cultural beliefs which associate "thinking too much"
with poor health outcomes (Frye and D'Avanzo, 1994;
Stevens, 2001):
[B]ut for users when using it and being asked to do this
[meditation] it's their brain problem, they would think a lot ...
Doing meditation is the best way but mostly for non-users, good
for non-users, users could not do this. It is the best way for
6 Methodological Innovations
non-users, but it is very difficult for users when staying quiet,
they tend to think a lot. Thinking a lot may lead to brain damage.
(Sohpa, 32-year-old woman)
While women felt it might be possible to meditate in a
group while attending the aftercare program, an overwhelm-
ing majority doubted that these skills would be practiced out-
side the group, often citing practical constraints such as
finding time or room to meditate in cramped living
conditions:
Because no one does meditation, just watch over the children all
the time ... If there is no gathering and after they return to their
homes, they will not do it ... They do it or anything only in front
of you. And then no one could take exercise [home] as everyone
thinks of only making his or her living. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old
woman)
While just over half the sample indicated that they per-
sonally would be prepared to do meditation, almost all par-
ticipants voiced concerns that others might find it too boring.
However, this apparent bias against meditation may be
explained by the fact that most participants understood medi-
tation in a religious sense, as opposed to the meditation exer-
cises envisaged in the original protocol. Many participants
also articulated a desire to learn stress relief techniques
which informed our decision to incorporate brief meditation
exercises into the aftercare program.
Importantly, most women identified entertainment and
"having fun" as an indispensable component of the aftercare
program and suggested many activities:
I request you to start the meeting once per week such as program
for exercises or dances or comedies. Just play what we call Leak
Kanseng game, we feel exhausted. This means that we stop this
and we don't think about it. We can play any entertainment
game. (Chakriya, 25-year-old woman)
Let's say, there are a lot [of games we could play] such as hitting
clay pots, Lot Anteak [Cambodian version of jump rope]. Boh
Angkunh [knocking down large seeds] is also good. (Srey
Neang, 27-year-old woman)
A key part of having fun was having lucky draws and
prizes. This was seen as particularly important given that
women would not be incentivized to attend the aftercare pro-
gram. Many women had previous exposure to lucky draws as
participants in SG programs:
I think it's good. It's like the SMARTgirl too. Because we can
get [an] understanding of it when we come and there is also a
lucky draw for prizes. (Rumdoul, 23-year-old woman)
There should any lucky draw for small prizes. We should some
items like ice bucket ... ice bucket and fan. Before the big prize
was bicycle. Like small blankets. We give them prizes. They
may feel happy when they win any prize. (Phany, 19-year-old
woman)
In relation to content of the aftercare program, what some
women dismissed as "boring," others insisted was essential.
The divergence of preferences highlighted the necessity for
balance between enjoyable and entertaining activities and
more educational and evidence-based components of the
program. Based on the input of FESW, the final aftercare
program included the following overarching domains: social
support for reducing stimulant use and related harms, cog-
nitive-behavioral recovery skills, culturally appropriate
experiential group exercises (e.g. role plays), as well as brief
meditation and relaxation training (Center for Substance
Abuse Treatment, 2006). We also included a "lucky draw"
whereby women draw one ticket from a prize bowl following
each group session. For each four session aftercare group,
prize bowls with 110 total tickets for the "lucky draw"
include one $10 ticket, 11 $5 tickets, 48 $2 tickets, and 50
tickets for applause and positive affirmations from the group
(Carrico et al., submitted).
Conclusion
Our results informed the development of the protocol for a
cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial with Cambodian
FESW who use ATS. Findings also provided key insights
into the concerns and preferences of FESW that shaped the
adaptation of the CCT intervention and the content of the
aftercare program. In particular, our qualitative observations
identified the role of poverty and transportation difficulties
as key barriers to engagement and participation, with the
potential to impact uptake of the intervention and the feasi-
bility of the proposed trial.
While the CCT concept had broad appeal, women had
strong views regarding the amount of the incentive and pro-
vided explicit feedback on the "value" of their time and living
costs. Participants were quick to point out that the maximum
incentive of USD$84 initially proposed compared extremely
poorly with most FESW earnings. In response, we modified
the protocol to allow for a USD$2 incentive for each negative
urine screen plus weekly bonuses of USD$8, USD$10, and
USD$12 for weeks 1­4, 5­8, and 9­12, respectively, making
for a total of USD$120. Our data also identified a need
for financial assistance with transport, which was absent in
the original trial protocol. In response, we offered women the
choice between receiving a USD$2 payment to cover the
costs of arranging their own transport or being transported by
SG Outreach Workers who were reimbursed USD$2.
Findings also informed pragmatic aspects of the trial such
as scheduling. We decided to provide women with a choice
between attending for urine screening on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
at any time between 8a.m. and 5p.m. with no appointment
necessary. Direct observation during specimen collection
was unacceptable to the majority of women interviewed. In
response, we removed the need for this using a Specimen
Validity Test on each sample to check for adulteration before
testing for ATS. Finally, input from our participants informed
Dixon et al. 7
the adaptation of the aftercare program to make it "fun" and
enjoyable for women while including four key components:
(1) group exercises; (2) recovery skills training; (3) medita-
tion and relaxation training; and (4) a lucky draw as positive
reinforcement for attendance.
Importantly, CIPI is the first trial assessing the impact of
a CCT intervention in reducing drug use and HIV risk to be
conducted in Asia. In resource-limited settings like
Cambodia, CCT interventions represent a time-limited,
potentially scalable approach to reducing ATS use and opti-
mizing HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The data presented
here indicate that CCT interventions are highly acceptable in
this setting, where women report widespread occupational
ATS use in order to cope with the conditions of sex work,
including long working hours, multiple clients, and extended
sexual transactions (Maher et al., 2011). The choice of a CCT
intervention appears particularly apposite in the Cambodian
context where there are currently limited options for drug
treatment. CCT may help FESW to engender lasting changes
by providing them with a minimum or base income while
attempting to reduce or abstain from ATS use and, poten-
tially, by incentivizing them to sustain these changes in the
longer term.
Indeed, the second component of the CIPI project involves
a microfinance intervention for women who are ATS-free.
Microfinance programs have been shown to increase wom-
en's empowerment as well as reduce gender inequality, vio-
lence, and improve health (Hamad and Fernald, 2012; Kim
et al., 2007, 2009; Pitt et al., 2003; Pronyk et al., 2006), in
association with economic benefits. Women who are ATS-
free will be offered the intervention, combining financial lit-
eracy education and referral to a Cambodian microloan
program. By integrating the CCT intervention with a sup-
portive aftercare program, CIPI aims to assist women to
achieve clinically meaningful reductions in their ATS use
that are necessary to benefit from the subsequent microfi-
nance intervention. However, becauseATS use assists FESW
with seeing more clients, it is possible that our intervention
may not adequately offset the lost earnings due to the rela-
tively modest amount of the cash incentives.
Further research is needed to examine whether and how
behavioral interventions targeting ATS use can be paired
with structural interventions such as microfinance that
address poverty as a driver of ATS use and HIV risk in this
population (Gupta et al., 2008). However, as highlighted
here, in the short-term, FESW will need to be incentivized at
a level which outweighs the occupational drive to use ATS.
This issue--getting the dose or the amount of the incentive
right--is crucial to the uptake of CCT interventions and the
success of trials designed to evaluate their impact.
Our results illustrate the value of formative research
designed to facilitate consultation with potential participants
in order to provide affected community input into the devel-
opment of both interventions and trial protocols. The rela-
tively inexpensive changes implemented as a result of our
findings have the potential to increase the acceptability of the
study and the intervention to prospective participants.
Preliminary data from the trial indicate the intervention is
feasible and acceptable to Cambodian FESW who use ATS.
Process indicators from the first six provinces in this ongoing
stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial demonstrate strong
engagement, with 138 of the 183 eligible FESW (75%) initi-
ating CCT and completing a median of 25 of the 36 possible
urine screening visits. Similarly, 79 of the 84 participants
eligible for aftercare (94%) attended at least one aftercare
group session and 57 (68%) completed three or more group
sessions (Carrico et al., in press).
Our results are particularly timely, given the growing
interest in strategies to improve the recruitment of partici-
pants to clinical trials (Mapstone et al., 2007) and health
research more broadly (Robinson et al., 2007). Suboptimal
accrual reduces power to detect significant effects, increases
costs, and may result in trial failure. Despite Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) guidelines which recommend that investiga-
tors should be able to demonstrate potential for recruiting the
required number of participants within the agreed recruit-
ment period (ICH, 1996), only 31% of recent clinical trials
sponsored by the UK Medical Research Council and the
Health Technology Assessment Program achieved their orig-
inal recruitment target and 55% did not reach a revised target
(McDonald et al., 2006). Inadequate enrollment thus reduces
the power of trials to detect effective interventions and may
delay the public health impact of a positive trial (Institute of
Medicine, 2008). Interventions to improve recruitment to
clinical trials have been systematically reviewed (Caldwell
et al., 2010), including two Cochrane reviews (Mapstone
et al., 2007; Treweek et al., 2010). While the effects of vari-
ous strategies remain unclear, with most studies examined
based on small samples and/or recruitment to hypothetical
trials (Caldwell et al., 2010; Mapstone et al., 2007; Treweek
et al., 2010), trial accrual is also impacted by the intervention
under study as well as the target population.
While the importance of using qualitative research for
community consultation and pre-trial engagement of target
populations has been previously demonstrated in preparatory
work for candidate vaginal microbicide trials inAfrica (Shagi
et al., 2008; Vallely et al., 2007, 2010), few studies have
assessed the acceptability of proposed interventions and
study protocols from the perspective of potential partici-
pants. Formative qualitative research with people who inject
drugs conducted as part of a hepatitis C virus vaccine prepar-
edness study informed the development of study protocols,
resulting in changes to the amount of participant reimburse-
ment (from AUD$30 to AUD$50), changes in the type of
reimbursement (from store vouchers to cash), and a decision
to reduce the amount of blood collected at screening (from
six tubes to one). These changes were relatively minor and
of minimal cost, yet had the potential to increase the accept-
ability of the study to prospective participants and therefore
maximize recruitment and retention (Maher et al., 2010;
Treloar et al., 2010; White et al., 2014). The results presented
here add to this literature by demonstrating the value of
8 Methodological Innovations
formative qualitative research in adapting interventions,
as well as trial protocols, to make them more acceptable to
potential participants.
Our results confirm the value of integrating formative
qualitative research into the process of clinical trial devel-
opment. Field trials and large-scale cluster randomized tri-
als are particularly resource-intensive, and in this context,
formative qualitative research represents a sound invest-
ment. In settings like Cambodia, where little is known
about the acceptability of proposed interventions or indeed
clinical trial participation itself, formative qualitative
research has the potential to yield even greater benefits.
As the results presented here indicate, had the CIPI trial
proceeded to recruit FESW into a trial where they were
incentivized USD$1 for a urine screening visit, this may
have resulted in sub-optimal recruitment leading to insuf-
ficient power to show an effect of the intervention. Under-
incentivizing CIPI participants also had the potential to
result in sampling bias with only impoverished FESW
enrolling in the trial, leading to non-generalizable findings
(Maher and Page, 2015). Formative qualitative research
clearly has the capacity to identify, from the perspective of
potential intervention recipients and research participants,
what is appropriate remuneration and why and to reveal
previously unconsidered barriers (e.g. lack of transporta-
tion, directly observed urine screening) and facilitators
(e.g. "fun" content) of participation, with the potential to
impact both the acceptability of interventions and their
implementation in the trial context.
These issues are particularly important, given the growing
interest in implementation science or the study of methods
for improving the uptake, implementation, and translation of
research findings into routine practice (Padian et al., 2011).
Given the historical preference and priority for discovery-
driven research over implementation science, qualitative
research is a powerful ally in shifting the focus away from
the discovery of "what" to elucidating the "how" (El-Sadr
et al., 2014: 1680). The application of qualitative research
methods to meaningfully involve affected populations in
planning, designing, and developing both interventions and
their implementation and evaluation has the potential to
increase trust and acceptability, improve recruitment and
retention, and provides an effective foundation for engage-
ment in future public health responses.
