Technology Report
Use of early real-time continuous glucose monitoring
(rtCGM) systems was correlated with significantly reduced
hemoglobinA1c (A1C), reduced time in hypoglycemia (<70
mg/dL), reduced time in hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL), and
increased time in range (70-180 mg/dL) for adults >25 years
with type 1 diabetes (T1D).1 However, glycemic control was
not significantly improved for CGM users ages 4-25 years;
this has been attributed to poor consistency of sensor wear in
this age group.1,2 The lack of sustained use and poor accep-
tance of early-generation CGM technologies correlated with
perceived and actual sensor inaccuracies, frustration with
nuisance alarms, body issues (size and appearance of sensor/
transmitter), painful insertion, and variable and often inade-
quate insurance coverage.3-5 Optimal CGM performance is
especially important in pediatric populations because they
experience greater glycemic variability and wider glycemic
excursions than adults with diabetes. 6
CGM adoption rates in pediatric patients with diabetes
have increased dramatically over the last decade,7 likely due
to improved system performance, and the introduction of
smartphone companion apps for real-time sharing and remote
monitoring. However, CGM users are still in the minority.
Barriers to increased adoption may include the requirement
for periodic fingerstick calibrations and short sensor wear
times. Here we report on the accuracy of a sixth-generation,
factory-calibrated rtCGM system ("G6") that addresses
some of the potential challenges to improved adoption in
children and adolescents.

Abstract
Background: The perceived value and consistent use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems depends in part on
their accuracy. We assessed the performance of a sixth-generation CGM system (Dexcom G6) in children and adolescents.
Methods: Forty-nine participants (6-17 years of age, mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 3.3 years), all with type 1 diabetes, enrolled and
data were available from 37. Each participant wore 1 sensor for up to 10 days and was asked to undergo an in-clinic visit
lasting 6-12 hours for frequent blood glucose (BG) sample testing on one of the sensor wear days. Estimated glucose values
(EGVs) from the G6 system were compared with venous BG values measured with a laboratory reference instrument (YSI).
Results: The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for 1387 EGV-YSI pairs was 7.7%, and the overall percentage
of EGVs within 20% or 20 mg/dL of the YSI reference value (for YSI > or 100 mg/dL, respectively, the "%20/20") was
96.2%. The %20/20 was 92.1% on Day 1 and 91.0% on Day 10 of sensor wear. For EGVs <70 mg/dL, 92.6% of the YSI values
were within 20 mg/dL and for EGVs >250 mg/dL, 100% of the YSI values were within 20%. Differences between EGVs and
YSI values in over 99.9% of the pairs posed no or only slight clinical risk as evaluated by surveillance error grid analysis.
Conclusions: The accuracy of the G6 CGM system in pediatrics may encourage consistent use of the system and contribute
to improved glycemic outcomes in this population.

Methods
Methods used to assess the performance of the G6 system
(Dexcom, Inc, San Diego, CA) have been published previ-
ously.8 Briefly, G6 was evaluated using retrospective data
from a prospectively designed, multicenter study involving
both adults (ages 18 and older) and pediatric participants
(ages 6 to 17) with T1D or insulin-requiring T2D at 4 U.S.
sites. Data presented here are from pediatric participants.
Study Procedures and Data Collection
All sensor insertions were performed at the clinic by partici-
pants and/or guardians using the automated sensor applica-
tor. All participants used the G6 system for one 10-day wear
period (up to 240 hours).
Pediatric participants returned to the clinic for one session
on days 1, 4-5, 7, or 10 of system use. Participants ages 6-12
years returned for one 6-hour clinic session and participants
ages 13-17 years returned for one 12-hour clinic session for
comparison of CGM readings with arterialized venous glu-
cose concentrations using a laboratory reference method
(YSI). Participants had venous sampling once every 15 ± 5
minutes for the duration of each clinic session for reference
glucose measurement. CGM data were masked during the
clinic session. The study was reviewed by the FDA through
the Investigational Device Exemption process and registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02880267).
Methods of Data Analysis
Analysis was performed on estimated glucose values
(EGVs) derived from reprocessed raw sensor data, without
incorporating information from fingerstick calibrations. YSI
values were paired with temporally matched EGVs; matched
pairs within the CGM reportable range of 40-400 mg/dL
were evaluated. No matched pair data were excluded from
analysis.
Accuracy metrics included the proportion of the EGVs
within ± 20% of paired YSI values >100 mg/dL or ±
20 mg/dL of YSI values 100 mg/dL (hereafter referred to
as %20/20), as well the analogous %15/15 and %30/30. The
overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was
determined as the average absolute relative difference
between paired EGVs and YSI values. Surveillance error
grid analysis9 was used to quantify the clinical risks resulting
from CGM inaccuracies.
Accuracy across glucose concentrations was evaluated for
the following ranges: hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), euglycemia
(70-180 mg/dL), Level 1 hyperglycemia (181-250 mg/dL), and
Level 2 hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL).10
Trend accuracy assessed the concurrence between rates of
glucose change measured by CGM and YSI. Rate of change
(RoC) was calculated by interpolating per-minute glucose con-
centrations for YSI and CGM data separately. Six YSI RoC
categories ranging from rapidly decreasing (<­2 mg/(dLmin))
to rapidly increasing (>2 mg/(dLmin)) were established. The
frequency of CGM-measured RoCs that agreed with YSI-
measured RoCs was assessed. Point and percentage accuracy
was also determined at different EGV RoCs. All analyses were
performed using SAS® software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Study Population
Twenty-one participants ages 6-12 years and 28 participants
ages 13-17 years enrolled. The mean (SD) age was 13.5 (3.3)
years; 61% were female; mean (SD) diabetes duration was
6.0 (4.0) years; 100% had T1D; 84% were using insulin
pumps; and mean (SD) A1C was 8.1 (1.1)%.
Twelve pediatric participants were excluded from the accu-
racy assessment: 6 withdrew from the study voluntarily after
sensor insertion, and 6 had a sensor or adhesive failure before
the clinic session. Thus, 37 pediatric participants contributed
EGV-YSI matched pairs for the accuracy assessment.
Accuracy Overall, Across Days of Wear, and
Across Glucose Ranges
There were 1387 EGVs that had a temporally matched YSI
reading and were used for analysis. The %15/15 accuracy
between EGV and YSI was 91.1%, the %20/20 was 96.2%,
and the MARD was 7.7%. The %30/30 was 99.6%, indicat-
ing very few outliers (Table 1).
Accuracy was consistent throughout the 10-day wear
period. The %15/15 and %20/20 on the first day of wear
Welsh et al 3
were 78.3% and 92.1%, respectively. The %15/15 and
%20/20 on Day 10 of sensor wear were 89.3% and 91.0%,
respectively (Table 1). MARD values on Day 1 and Day 10
were 10.5% and 7.1%, respectively (Table 1).
There was consistently high accuracy across glucose con-
centrations. The %20/20 accuracy of the G6 System was
92.6% in the hypoglycemic range, 96.6% in the euglycemic
range, 95.1% in the Level 1 hyperglycemic range, and 100%
in the Level 2 hyperglycemia range (Table 2). The corre-
sponding %15/15 and %30/30 accuracies across glucose
ranges, as well as MAD and MARD, are reported in Table 2.
Trend Accuracy and Accuracy Across Rates of
Change
When G6 EGVs were falling rapidly (<­2 mg/(dLmin)), cor-
responding YSI values were falling 100% of the time; when
EGVs were rising rapidly (>2 mg/(dLmin)), corresponding
YSI values were rising 98.6% of the time (Table 3). When
EGVs were steady (-1 mg/(dLmin) to  1 mg/(dLmin)),
YSI glucose was changing rapidly less than 0.5% of the time.
Percentage and point accuracy was demonstrated during
rapid rates of change (Table 4), with %20/20 accuracy no
less than 81.8% and MARD of no more than 11.9% for any
RoC category analyzed. Remarkably, when EGVs were ris-
ing rapidly (>2 mg/(dlmin)), the %20/20 was 94.2% and the
MARD was 7.7% (Table 4).
Surveillance Error Grid Analysis
The discrepancies between the vast majority of EGV-YSI
pairs posed no or only slight clinical risk when evaluated by
surveillance error grid analysis (Figure 1). These plots dem-
onstrate that 1276 (92.0%) pairs fell in the "No Risk" zone,
106 (7.6%) were in the "Slight, Lower" risk zone, 4 (0.3%)
were in the "Slight, Higher" risk zone and only 1 (<0.1%)
was in the "Moderate, Lower" risk zone (Figure 1).
Conclusion/Discussion
In the landmark 2008 JDRF CGM study,1 only 50% of 8- to
14-year-olds and only 30% of 15- to 24-year-olds wore
CGM devices consistently for 6 days a week. In contrast,
86% of adults ages 18+ years in the same study wore CGM
6 days a week. A separate study of CGM adherence in
children <4 years published in 201211 showed that only
45% of participants used CGM 6 days a week. Poor dura-
bility among pediatric participants was associated with dis-
comfort, too-frequent alarms, overwhelming amounts of
information, and "glitches" found with early-generation
CGM systems.3,5,11 However, the transition from an early- to
a newer-generation CGM system (Dexcom SEVEN PLUS

to Dexcom G4 Platinum) significantly improved adherence
in pediatric patients.12
The new G6 system offers several new features, including
elimination of calibration requirements, 10-day sensor wear
time, resistance to acetaminophen interference,13 and simpli-
fied sensor insertion.14 G6 accuracy in pediatric participants
is consistently high across wear sites,8 days of wear, glucose
ranges, and rates of glucose change. Performance of G6 in
pediatric participants eclipses that of G4 Platinum and G5
Mobile, especially with regard to overall accuracy.12 Together
these attributes should provide pediatric users and their
guardians with high device confidence and facilitate persis-
tent use.
Outcome studies utilizing current-generation CGM tech-
nologies, including G6, in pediatric patients are pending. The
Strategies to Enhance New CGM Use in Early Childhood
(SENCE) trial (NCT02912728) will evaluate the impact of
CGM alone and CGM combined with family behavioral
training on CGM-derived glycemic metrics, A1C, and qual-
ity-of-life measures in young children (<8 years) with T1D.
The CGM Intervention in Teens and Young Adults with type
1 Diabetes (CITY) trial (NCT03263494) seeks to determine
the effect of CGM use on A1C, CGM-derived glycemic met-
rics, and quality-of-life measures in adolescents and young
adults (14-<25 years) with suboptimally controlled diabetes
(A1C 7.5-<11%). These studies will help to determine the
extent to which improvements made in technology facilitate
adherence and improve glycemic control in challenging,
pediatric patient populations. Hopefully, these studies will
also influence payer coverage policies to facilitate CGM use
for all eligible patients.
