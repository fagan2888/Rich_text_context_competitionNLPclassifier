Introduction
Climate change with its associated global warming is an envi-
ronmental issue that is most dreaded and poses a lot of threat
to the very existence of human beings, and all efforts are
being made to curb it (Borenstein, 2009; Cherry, 2011;
Pettenger, cited by Feirabend & Eilks, 2010). Different meth-
ods are being used to find solutions to this menace. Education
is one of the methods that have been recommended (Anderson,
2010; Cherry, 2011; Sharma, 2012; Stanford University,
2011). Although there are many advocates of having climate
change education incorporated in the educational system,
there are counter arguments against that (Fortner, 2001;
Tomasevic, 2013). The reasons given by the opposers are: (a)
the real cause of climate change is not known, so why teach
students what is not fully established (Conger, 2013;
Tomasevic, 2013), (b) overloading of school curricula (Smith,
2013), and (c) it is not man-made (Conger, 2013). For exam-
ple, in the United States, the controversial nature of its inclu-
sion led to the slashing off of some of the content of climate
change from the science curriculum and emphasis on its
anthropogenic nature was also reduced (Tomasevic, 2013).
United Kingdom removed it from its curriculum (Tomasevic,
2013) but has brought it back (Smith, 2013).
Literature reveals that opposition to climate change educa-
tion comes mainly from non-scientists and are found in non-
refereed journals and are often funded by special interest
(Cherry, 2011; Tomasevic, 2013). The controversies sur-
rounding the inclusion of climate change in school curricula
has made it difficult for its integration in the curricula of some
schools (Tomasevic, 2013). That notwithstanding, it has been
included successfully in the curricula of some schools
(Roehrig, Campbell, Dalbotten, & Varma, 2012) because it
equips the young who have more years to live and therefore
will have longer exposure to the effects of climate change.
Although recent research has shown that knowledge about
climate change does not automatically mean concern toward
it (Battistoni, 2012), the reasons for learning about climate
change far outweigh the reverse. This is also because there is
evidence that students equipped with such knowledge show
concern for it (Cherry, 2011).

Climate Change Education: The Role of
Pre-Tertiary Science Curricula in Ghana
Cecilia Boakye1
Abstract
The study found out the role that some selected science curricula of the pre-tertiary level of education in Ghana played with
respect to climate change education. Content analysis was used to analyze four science curricula of the pre-tertiary levels
of education in Ghana, namely, the curriculum for primary, Grades 1 to 3 (age = 6-9 years); integrated science curriculum
of primary, Grades 4 to 6 (age = 9-12 years); integrated science curriculum of the Junior High School (JHS; age = 12-13
years); and the integrated science curriculum of the Senior High School (SHS; age = 13-16 years). It was found that of the
four curricula, it was only in the integrated science syllabuses of the SHS and that of the JHS that climate change as a topic
for study had been stated categorically, but, even then, the teaching and learning methods needed to be improved on. It
was practically non-existent in the natural science curriculum of Primary Grades 1 to 3. There were topics in some of the
curricula such as "Ecosystems," "Photosynthesis," and "Energy" that can provide links to climate change education but were
not linked to it. Some of the suggestions made to make these curricula play their roles in climate change education are that:
(a) topics that lend themselves to climate change education in the various curricula could be linked to it in the teaching
and learning situation to reinforce learning and (b) teaching and learning methods should be improved upon for effective
attitudinal and behavioral changes to help mitigate climate change and its impact.

For climate change education to be effectively imple-
mented in schools, there is the need to find out the extent of
its integration into school curricula so that any deficiencies
can be addressed. Research into the extent of integration of
climate change in school science curricula has been done in
some countries (Dalelo, 2012; Republic of Kenya, 2012). In
both cases, content analysis was used to analyze curricula
and syllabi. Findings from both studies stated abysmal inte-
gration of climate change in the curricula of the schools and
the non-action-oriented nature of the teaching and learning
methods. Action-oriented methods make students active par-
ticipants in the lesson or have the potential to sensitize stu-
dents to take action (Carboschools Consortium, 2010; Filho,
Pace, & Manolas, 2010). There is the need to do the same for
the curricula of other countries so that climate change educa-
tion can be integrated effectively in school curricula. In this
study, I also sought to find out the extent of integration of
climate change into science curricula of pre-tertiary schools
in Ghana so that if there was a need for improvement, this
could be done to promote effective climate change education
in Ghana. This is necessary because Ghana is experiencing
the impact of climate change, and she needs to educate her
citizens to help mitigate climate change and its effects.
Context of the Study
There have been reported cases of environmental catastro-
phes in Africa due to climate change (AllAfrica, 2013; Ofei-
Nkansah, 2013; Wikimedia Foundation Inc., 2013; The World
Bank Group, 2013), and Ghana has her fair share of it (Badu-
Agyei, 2012; Boadi, 2013; GhanaCentric, 2010; Kunateh,
2013; Mller-Kuckelberg, 2012). Climate change has posed a
lot of problems in Ghana such as (a) change in rainfall pat-
terns, (b) a rise in the incidence of pests and diseases of crops
and livestock, (c) reduction in crop yield, and (d) destruction
of lives and property caused by floods and droughts (Kunateh,
2013). All these have negative effect on income generation
activities. Some of the human activities that contribute to the
climate problems in Ghana are deforestation caused by bush
burning and the use of wood as fuel and charcoal making
(GhanaCentric, 2010). This situation has demanded that
efforts must be made in Ghana to combat climate change. To
this end, a National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) has been
made, and it has been approved by parliament to help combat
the effects of climate change in Ghana (OmgGhana, 2013).
The University of Ghana on its part has introduced two post-
graduate programmes in climate change and sustainable
development for the 2012-2013 academic year. The aims of
the programmes "are to contribute to the development of
expertise in Ghana and Afrclimate change and development
issues and to promote research on climate change impact
assessment, adaptation and mitigation" (University of Ghana,
2013, p. 1). The president of Africa University College of
Communication (AUCC) also expressed the desire to restruc-
ture its curriculum to integrate climate lessons to equip their
students so that they can educate ordinary citizens, including
farmers (OmgGhana, 2013). Ghana needs to integrate climate
change education into the curricula of the basic to the tertiary
levels of education after reviewing them (GhanaCentric,
2010). This according to Ghanacentric, will produce the local
expertise to manage crisis and reach out to the entire popula-
tion.Also as a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it is also oblig-
atory for Ghana to control her own greenhouse emission
(GhanaCentric, 2010).
In Ghana, the pre-tertiary education consists of pre-
school, followed by 3 years of lower primary and 3 years of
upper primary. The next level is the Junior High School
(JHS) that is of 3-year duration. Successful candidates enter
the Senior High Schools (SHSs). At all these levels, science
is taught except at the pre-school level. One objective for the
teaching and learning of science at these levels is to equip the
students to solve environmental problems. Is climate change,
which is a very important environmental problem, factored
into the science curricula at these levels? Knowing the state
of climate change education in the pre-tertiary curricula is
important so that it can be made more effective if there is that
need. Students can be better equipped in that way so that
they, in turn, can educate the populace.
The purpose of the study was, therefore, to find out the
extent of integration of climate change education in the
pre-tertiary science curricula and to make suggestions if
necessary. The study answered specifically the following
questions:
Research Question 1: To what extent is climate change
integrated in the science curricula at the pre-tertiary levels
of education, if at all?
Research Question 2: If climate change has not been
integrated, how can it be improved upon?
Literature Review
The Need for Climate Change Education
Although natural phenomena such as ocean currents, emis-
sions from volcanoes, or normal climate variability can
influence climate change to a great extent, it is also influ-
enced by some of these activities of humans: deforestation,
intensive farming, and intensive use of fossil fuels (Sharma,
2012). The anthropogenic nature of global climate change
has support in the literature (Semper, 2010; Sharma, 2012;
Stanford University, 2011). There is, therefore, the need for
something more than technology to address it. Sharma
argued that if it were the consequences of individual actions,
as shared by Pettenger, cited by Feirabend and Eilks (2010),
then the logical thing to do to address global climate change
was to educate individuals to behave in environmentally
responsive ways. As a social solution, Sharma suggested that
the preparation of students in schools should equip them with
a better understanding of climate change to enable them to
Boakye 3
act in ways that will sustain the environment. According to
CarboSchools Consortium (2010), Sharma (2012), Stanford
University (2011), and United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] (2009), education is
an indispensable component of any program to combat cli-
mate change and its effects. For example, if one considers
"adaptation" and "mitigation," which are the two current
approaches in responding to climate change (Ofei-Nkansah,
2013), not much can be done to combat climate change and
its effects without education.
The need for education is clarified by Dyster (2013):
Education is the most powerful tool and can engage young
people in the debate, prepare them for working with the green
economy, and give the definitive science and facts about the
biggest issue facing young people. To quote H.G. Wells: "Human
history becomes more and more a race between education and
catastrophe." (p. 3)
Research shows that pupils are empowered to do some-
thing about climate change and feel positive and less wor-
ried about it when they are given accurate information about
it (Bryan, 2011). Examples abound in the literature where
education has been helpful in addressing issues with respect
to climate change such as: (a) when a 15-year-old student
opposed the removal of climate change from the geography
curriculum of the United Kingdom by writing eloquently
about the dangers of its removal. Thirty thousand signatures
supported her petition in a matter of weeks (Dyster, 2013)
(b) pupils made a great impact in their communities regard-
ing the reduction of global warming gas emission with
resultant great monetary savings through school carbon
reduction initiatives (Cherry, 2011) and (c) The League of
Conservation Voters Education Fund found in a study that it
was information from educational materials that their chil-
dren brought home from school that even environmentally
minded citizens received most of their "green" information.
Moreover, it was pressure from their children that caused
them to act in a responsible way toward their environment
(Cherry, 2011).
Although children are vulnerable, they are agents of
change in climate change issues (Anderson, 2010; UNICEF,
2012). Thus, if children are empowered by providing them
with the necessary education on disasters and climate change
in a conducive environment, their vulnerability is reduced,
and, at the same time, they contribute to sustaining the envi-
ronment. Such knowledge and empowerment given to chil-
dren through the school curriculum results in reduced
vulnerability to risk, and, at the same time, it promotes the
achievement of children's environmental rights as is con-
tained in the numerous articles of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (UNICEF, 2012).
Different definitions have been given to climate change
education, but they mainly stress on knowledge, attitudinal,
and behavioural change. One such definition is:
climate change education is about helping learners understand
and address the impacts of global warming today, while at the
same time encouraging the change in attitudes and behavior
needed to put our world on a more sustainable path in the future.
(Matsuura quoted by UNESCO, 2009, p. 3)
Therefore, some of the characteristics of a climate literate
person are that the person is: (a) knowledgeable enough
about climate change to take informed decisions that will
help mitigate climate change, and (b) has desirable attitude
and behaviour toward climate adaptation and mitigation
(Anderson, 2010; Semper, 2010). A successful climate
change education should therefore move from awareness, to
understanding, and finally taking action (Carboschools
Consortium, 2010).
Teaching and Learning Methods in Climate
Change Education
Because climate change education involves learning that
should change attitude and behaviour, the teaching and learn-
ing method is very important. Literature supports active
learning (Bryan, 2011; Carboschools Consortium, 2010;
Cherry, 2011; Pruneau, Grave, Bourque, & Langis, 2003;
Roehrig et al., 2012). According to Bryan (2011), the teach-
ing and learning methods should touch the heart as well as
the mind. Cherry (2011), through her Young Voices on
Climate Change project, used methods that touched the
hearts as well as the minds of the young people, and this had
a great impact in the community in which the young people
lived. Cherry used motivational Young Voices on Climate
Change films in which children were involved in activities to
combat climate change.
With respect to climate change "the main emphasis of any
educational campaign should be on learning not on teaching"
(Filho et al., 2010, p. 144). Carboschools Consortium (2010)
recommended that to enable pupils to become active mem-
bers of society in future, action skills in which a situation is
created for pupils to experience the democratic process of
thinking up, agreeing, implementing, and evaluating con-
crete changes individually and in a group should be used in
climate change education.
Climate Change Education and the Science
Curriculum
Some of the causes of climate change such as greenhouse
effect, bush burning, and deforestation make it science
related. According to Tomasevic (2013), climate change is
science. Science lessons have been used to teach climate
change and some of such lessons are found in the literature
(Fries-Gaither, 2010; Smith, 2013). Some of the science top-
ics that have been used in climate change lessons are energy
(Climate Change Live, 2013; Fries-Gaither, 2010), photo-
synthesis (Mr. Green Lesson Plan, 2010), and the forest (Job
4 SAGE Open
Corps Lesson Plan, 2008; Kindlmannová & Semeráková,
2010). In the U.S. curriculum, climate change forms part of
the science curriculum (Tomasevic, 2013). In Ethiopia, it is
integrated into the Biology curriculum (Dalelo, 2012).
However, the literature reveals that science alone is not
very effective in the teaching and learning of climate change.
"Climate change science is one of the first science topics that
social science physical science collaboration is required"
(Semper, 2010, p. 8). Many suggestions have been given as
to what should constitute a climate change curriculum. Some
examples are that it should be (a) multidisciplinary/interdis-
ciplinary (Roehrig et al., 2012; Semper, 2010) and (b) part of
the science curriculum (Conger, 2013). The interdisciplinary
approach to climate change education has been used success-
fully in the CYCLES approach. The approach blended inte-
grative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to
teach climate change. That approach motivated the students
and engaged them in meaningful problems within their com-
munities. The conclusion drawn from the approach was that
there is the need for new approaches to science teaching and
learning that can promote the kinds of skills and critical
thinking needed to address the global and multidisciplinary
problems facing our planet (Roehrig et al., 2012).
Method
It was a content analysis research in which I purposively
sampled and analyzed the natural and integrated science cur-
riculum documents of the pre-tertiary institutions to find out
to what extent climate change as a topic had been included.
The documents were the syllabuses, the textbooks, and the
teachers' guides. The pre-tertiary documents selected for the
lower primary to JHS were implemented in 2012 and those
of the SHS were implemented in 2010. They are: (a) lower
primary, Grades 1 to 3, natural science syllabus (Ministry of
Education, 2012a); (b) lower primary, Grades 1 to 3, natural
science teachers'guides (Asiedu, Baah-Yeboah, & Domptey,
2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d, 2012e, 2012f); (c) lower pri-
mary, Grades 1 to 3, natural science textbooks (Asiedu et al.,
2012a, 2012b, 2012c); (d) upper primary, Grades 4 to 6, inte-
grated science syllabus (Ministry of Education, 2012b); (e)
upper primary, Grades 4 and 6, integrated science textbooks
(Yeboah, Kwesi-Ahordjie, & Mensah, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c,
2012d); (f) upper primary, Grades 4 and 6, integrated science
teachers'guides (Yeboah et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d);
(g) JHS, Years 1 to 3, integrated science syllabus (Ministry of
Education, 2012c); (h) JHS, Years 1 to 3, integrated science
textbooks (Kom-Zuta, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d, 2012e,
2012f); (i) JHS, Years 1 to 3, integrated science teachers'
guides (Kom-Zuta, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d, 2012e,
2012f); and (j) SHS integrated science, Years 1 to 3, syllabus
(Ministry of Education, 2010). I chose the natural science
and integrated science curricula because they were core cur-
ricula. Other curricula in the Ghanaian pre-tertiary education
that had some element of climate change are the (a) SHS
biology, (b) SHS chemistry, and (c) SHS geography.
However, they were elective curricula and besides, the aspect
of climate change (greenhouse effect) and the teaching and
learning methods were almost the same as those found in the
science core curricula that I chose for this study. The curri-
cula that had the potential to be used for the teaching and
learning of climate change at the pre-tertiary level were the
social studies curricula of the basic schools and SHSs.
However, no element of climate change was incorporated in
either of them. The textbooks and teachers'guides that I used
were based on the syllabuses. Because the syllabuses were
teaching syllabuses, what they contained was not much dif-
ferent from how the curricula were enacted. The content of
all the syllabuses that I used had been arranged in units (see
the appendix). I also analyzed the West Africa Examination
Council (WAEC) test items for Basic Education Certificate
Examination (BECE), West Africa Senior Secondary School
Certificate Examination (WASSCE), and Senior Secondary
School Certificate Examination (SSSCE) to find out if cli-
mate change items were included. WAEC is the principal
examining institution for the West African sub-region. BECE
is the final examination at the end of basic school (primary
and JHS) education that qualified one to enter the SHS.
SSSCE and WASSCE are the examinations at the end of
SHS education that qualified one to enter a higher (tertiary)
institution. SSSCE has been phased out, and it has been
replaced with WASSCE. For BECE, the papers I analyzed
were from 1990 to 2012. Those of SSSCE and WASSCE
were from 1993 to 2014. I used quantitative and qualitative
methods in this study.
To establish the extent of the integration of climate change
in each curriculum, I based my analysis on: (a) the propor-
tion of climate change topic(s) in the syllabus, (b) the nature
of the information the climate change topic(s) provided, (c)
the nature of the teaching and the learning methods associ-
ated with the topics, (d) potential climate change topics that
have not been related to it, and (e) the frequency of assess-
ment based on climate change.
To establish the proportion of the curriculum that made up
climate change, the units in the syllabuses served as units of
analysis. I counted the units that contained climate change
topics for each syllabus and proportions were established
using percentages. The percentage was calculated by divid-
ing the number of climate change unit(s) I identified by the
total number of units in the syllabus and multiplied the result
by 100. For the nature of the content, it was found out
whether they promoted climate change education by provid-
ing knowledge about climate change that will help a person
to make informed decisions with respect to adaptation and
mitigation (Semper, 2010). Because climate change knowl-
edge demands attitudinal change, teaching and learning
methods must have the potential to foster that. I therefore
analyzed the teaching and learning methods to see whether
they were action-oriented by using methods that involve (a)
active participation of the students (Bryan, 2011;
Boakye 5
Carboschools Consortium, 2010; Pruneau et al., 2003;
Roehrig et al., 2012) and/or (b) methods that have the poten-
tial to promote active participation in the fight against cli-
mate, such as observing other children involved in climate
change activities (Cherry, 2011). The fourth criterion for the
integration was whether there were topics that have the
potential to be used to teach climate change and whether they
have been used for that purpose. Relating such topics to cli-
mate change can have the potential to reinforce learning
because of the repetition and also enhance adaptation and
mitigation. For the fifth criterion that is on assessment, I ana-
lyzed WAEC test items for BECE (1990-2012), WASSCE,
and SSSCE (1993-2014) to see whether students'knowledge
on climate change was assessed and the kind of knowledge
that was assessed. I solicited the assistance of another col-
league, science educator, to do the same analysis using the
five criteria, and the two outcomes were reconciled so that
the analyses were objective.
Results and Discussion
The Extent of Integration of Climate Change Into
the Pre-Tertiary Science Curricula
Table 1 shows the integration of climate change in the four
curricula.
The content analysis revealed that climate change was
non-existent in the curricula of the lower primary, Grades 1
to 3, and upper primary, Grades 4 to 6, but was present in the
JHS and SHS curricula.
As can be seen from Table 1, at both the JHS and SHS levels
the proportion of climate change integrated into both curricula
were the same, 2%. The 2% climate change content of both the
SHS and JHS leaves much to be desired considering the fact
that there were potential topics in the curriculum that could
have been related to it to reinforce learning. Nonetheless, the
2% is higher than what was found in Kenya (Republic of
Kenya, 2012) where only 0.53% of the total secondary school
curriculum addressed directly or indirectly climate change
issues. The absence of climate change in the primary school
curriculum in Ghana is worrisome. The situation is unlike
Kenya and other places where teaching and learning of climate
change start in the primary school (Cherry, 2011; Republic of
Kenya, 2012). UNICEF (2012) actually supports the empower-
ment of children with climate change information.
Lower and upper primary curricula and climate change integration.
Although climate change was not integrated into the curri-
cula of the lower and upper primary, there were topics in
both curricula that lent themselves to climate change as can
be seen in Table 1. The science curriculum of the lower pri-
mary consisted of topics in the major branches of science.
The purpose of the lower primary science curriculum was to
provide a strong foundation for further study of science at the
upper primary level and beyond (Ministry of Education,
2012a). That climate change was absent in the science curri-
cula of the lower and upper primary is worrisome. This is
because children form a large part of millions of people
needed to mitigate climate change and its impact (Cherry,
2011). This situation is not in conformity with the suggestion
of Stanford University (2011) about children's knowledge of
climate change. Moreover, it is the opposite of what is being
done in the American school system (Tomasevic, 2013).
In the upper primary integrated science curriculum, the
topic "Flooding" in the syllabus could have provided a good
link to climate change, but content analysis of the syllabus,
pupils' textbooks, and the teacher's guide revealed that that
link was absent. Table 2 shows the teaching and learning activ-
ities and evaluation as given in the upper primary syllabus on
the topic "Flooding."
The role of climate change in flooding should have been
included. Prevention of flooding was included in the content
of the textbook, but it was not related to climate change. The
preventive measures to flooding that were stated in the
pupil's textbook, such as not building in waterways are good,
but it should not end there. Children must learn about climate
change adaptation and how to be safe during disasters. Skills
such as first aid, swimming, and water safety can be learned
through simulation and drills. Then, through theater and
music activities, they can educate their communities.
Training children in disaster skills has been done in the
Philippines and has proved useful. In Liloan and San
Francisco villages, knowledge learnt that way saved both
adults and children from a landslide (Anderson, 2010).

Junior secondary school and climate change integration. In the
JHS syllabus, climate change was integrated in the JHS 2
under "carbon cycle."
Content analysis of the pupil's science textbook on "car-
bon cycle" showed that pupils were supposed to be intro-
duced to the following terms: "greenhouse effect,"
"greenhouse gas," "climate change," photosynthesis, com-
bustion, atmosphere, carbon cycle, deforestation. This is
good, because they are all related to climate change. They
were also supposed to learn about the negative effects of cli-
mate change and the activities that can cut down on green-
house emission such as the use of less fossil fuel, and the use
of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power.
Pupils were supposed to carry out a role-play to represent the
carbon cycle. These activities can empower the pupils with
knowledge on climate change as recommended by (Anderson,
2010; Semper, 2010; UNESCO, 2009). Moreover, such infor-
mation in their notebooks/textbooks may sensitize others
such as their parents who may read them as was reported by
Cherry (2011). It can also empower them with some knowl-
edge on mitigation. However, action-oriented teaching and
learning methods where students learn by doing as suggested
by Carboschools Consortium (2010) and used successfully by
Cherry (2011) were lacking. This situation does not augur
well for the acquisition of attitudinal and behavioural changes
that are needed for combating climate change. The teaching
and learning methods can be improved upon to help the pupils
make more impact on their environment as was done by
Cherry (2011) and learn adaptation methods as was reported
by Anderson (2010). The evaluation activities and student
activities in Table 3 are not action-oriented. There was one
item in the science textbook that asked the pupils to find out
how climate change may affect Ghana and how the impact
could be reduced. This is good because it is sensitizing them
to mitigation. It can however be improved upon , for example,
by asking the pupils about the effect of climate change on
their school compound and in the communities they live and
the action they can take if there is a negative impact. Then
students can be engaged in action-oriented activities.
Although the climate change content in the JHS curriculum
was 2%, it is higher than what was found in Ethiopia (Dalelo,
2012) and in Kenya (Republic of Kenya, 2012). One limita-
tion in this study is that the textbook and teacher's guide for
Primary Grade 5 were not available to be analyzed. However,
the syllabus reflected what should be in the textbook and
teacher's guide, because it was a teaching syllabus.
The analyses of the BECE test items revealed that from
1990 to 2012 it was only in 2011 that an item on climate
change formed part of the assessment. That item demanded
of the candidates to mention two ways in which the carbon
cycle can be maintained and to state one environmental
effect when the carbon cycle is disrupted. This formed two
separate subsections of an item with four subsections. The
indication from this observation is that climate change does
not feature much in the assessment at the BECE level. This is
to be expected because the BECE is based on the whole of
the basic school syllabus in which the component of climate
change is only 2% of the JHS curriculum.

SHS and climate change integration. The climate change com-
ponent of the SHS integrated science syllabus is one unit out
of 50 (2%) of the total content of the SHS integrated science
teaching syllabus. It formed part of the SHS 1 syllabus under
"interactions in nature." Table 4 shows the content of the cli-
mate change in the SHS syllabus.
For the SHS, one limitation was that only the teaching syl-
labus was analyzed. The SHS syllabus is also a teaching syl-
labus, and it reflects the content to be taught in the curriculum.
In the SHS syllabus, similar to the JHS, students were sup-
posed to be equipped with knowledge on the effects of cli-
mate change. This is in line with Anderson (2010), Semper
(2010), and UNESCO (2009). The suggested evaluations in
the syllabus are: (a) differentiate between the troposphere and
stratosphere in terms of the following: temperature, air com-
position, and pressure; and (b) outline five effects of climate
change on biodiversity resources. In terms of action-oriented
activities (Carboschools Consortium, 2010) that promote atti-
tudinal and behavioral changes, these were lacking in the sug-
gested evaluation. The latter evaluation on biodiversity is
good but can be made better if students transfer the knowl-
edge to their community by finding out the effect of climate
change on biodiversity in their community. After that, they
can be engaged in activities in their community to mitigate or
prevent climate change and its impact depending on the out-
come of their investigation. That will make it action-oriented
(Bryan, 2011; Carboschools Consortium, 2010; Cherry, 2011;
Pruneau et al., 2003; Roehrig et al., 2012). The topics that are
related to climate change in the SHS curriculum (Table 1) can
also be used to reinforce knowledge on climate change.
The analysis of the SSSCE and WASSCE items (1993-
2014) showed that climate change was featured in (a) 1999,
SSSCE; (b) 2000, SSSCE; (c) 2006, WASSCE; (d) 2011,
WASSCE; and (e) 2014, WASSCE. Thus, within that
period, items on climate change had been assessed in 4 out
of the 14 years. This is to be expected because climate
change forms only 2% of the SHS curriculum. The items
mainly focused on the gas responsible for the greenhouse
effect and how global warming can be minimized. The test
items reflected the nature of the climate change content that
was stated in the syllabus.
Conclusions and Implications
On the whole, the extent of integration of climate change into
the pre-tertiary science curricula in Ghana leaves much to be
desired. The content analysis of the four science curricula
revealed that climate change is factored into the JHS and
SHS curricula, but it is non-existent in the lower and upper
primary curricula. Leaving the upper and lower primaries out
cuts off children whom literature shows are very effective in
the fight against climate change (Cherry, 2011). For the JHS
and SHS curricula, climate change formed 2% in each case
but there are topics in both curricula that lend themselves to
climate change education some of which have been used in
that respect in the literature (Climate Change Live, 2013;
Fries-Gaither, 2010; Mr. Green Lesson Plan, 2010; Job Corps
Lesson Plan, 2008; Kindlmannová & Semeráková, 2010).
Probably, relating those topics to climate change may over-
load the curricula (Smith, 2013). The climate change content
generally provides factual knowledge to the students which
are not in line with the expectation of the nature of climate
change education (Anderson, 2010; Carboschools
Consortium, 2010; Semper, 2010). The teaching and learning

activities are generally inadequate because they are not
action-oriented as has been suggested in the literature (Bryan,
2011; Carboschools Consortium 2010; Cherry, 2011;
Pruneau et al., 2003; Roehrig et al., 2012) and used effec-
tively (Anderson, 2010; Cherry, 2011). They can help to pro-
vide students with knowledge about climate change but can
hardly help the students in the adaptation and mitigation of
climate change.
Climate change items are factored into the BECE and
WASSCE/SSSCE. The implication is that it is deemed to be
important and for that matter, the students must have knowl-
edge on it. However, the frequency of the incorporation of
the test items is higher at the WASSCE/SSSCE level than at
the BECE level. This shows the less emphasis given to it at
that level. This is to be expected because at that level, there
is a total absence of climate change content at both the upper
and lower primary curricula.
Suggestions
For the curriculum to play its role in climate change educa-
tion properly and for Ghana to play a more effective role as a
signatory to the Kyoto Protocol (GhanaCentric, 2010), there
is the need to infuse climate change content into the curricu-
lum of the lower and upper primary to make the students
knowledgeable and be able to take part in debates and deci-
sions on it (Dyster, 2013) and also equip them with the skills
needed for mitigation and adaptation (Anderson, 2010;
UNICEF, 2012).
The topics that lend themselves to climate change in the
four curricula can be used for reinforcement of knowledge
on climate change if that will not overload the curriculum
(Smith, 2013). The "application" aspect of the Ghanaian pre-
tertiary science lesson plan (Arhin & Asimah, 2006) where
the knowledge gained in a lesson is applied to everyday life
can be used for that purpose. That aspect takes up only 2 to 4
minutes of the lesson. The literature has lessons on science
topics and how they are related to climate change, and teach-
ers can avail themselves of such lessons.
The teaching and learning activities should be improved
upon to provide opportunities for students to acquire skills
for adaptation and mitigation with respect to climate change
as has been done in other places (Anderson, 2010). All these
have implication for facilities and resources. Facilities and
resources must be made available to engage the students in
activities that will give the students knowledge about climate
change. Teachers who are the implementers of the curricu-
lum must be knowledgeable about climate change and be
prepared to engage students in action-oriented activities.
Pupils can be engaged in greening activities on their school
compound.
An interdisciplinary approach to the teaching and learn-
ing of climate change (Roehrig et al., 2012; Semper, 2010)
can be adopted to effectively groom the students for adapta-
tion and mitigation because the science curriculum alone
cannot do that effectively. This has implication for research.
Research can be done by analyzing all the Ghanaian basic
and SHS curricula that lend themselves to climate change
education so that a better approach to the teaching and learn-
ing of climate change that meets all the conditions specified
in climate change education (Anderson, 2010; Semper, 2010)
can be developed.
