Glial glucokinase expression in adult and post-natal development of the hypothalamic region. ASN NEURO 2(3):art:e00035.doi:10.1042/AN20090059
ABSTRACT
It has recently been proposed that hypothalamic glial cells
sense glucose levels and release lactate as a signal to activate
adjacent neurons. GK (glucokinase), the hexokinase involved
in glucose sensing in pancreatic b-cells, is also expressed in
the hypothalamus. However, it has not been clearly
determined if glial and/or neuronal cells express this protein.
Interestingly, tanycytes, the glia that cover the ventricular
walls of the hypothalamus, are in contact with CSF
(cerebrospinal fluid), the capillaries of the arcuate nucleus
and adjacent neurons; this would be expected for a system
that can detect and communicate changes in glucose
concentration. Here, we demonstrated by Western-blot
analysis, QRT­PCR [quantitative RT­PCR (reverse transcrip-
tion­PCR)] and in situ hybridization that GK is expressed in
tanycytes. Confocal microscopy and immunoultrastructural
analysis revealed that GK is localized in the nucleus and
cytoplasm of b1-tanycytes. Furthermore, GK expression
increased in these cells during the second week of post-natal
development. Based on this evidence, we propose that
tanycytes mediate, at least in part, the mechanism by which
the hypothalamus detects changes in glucose concentrations.
Key words: arcuate nucleus, brain, glia, glucokinase,

INTRODUCTION
The hypothalamus has been associated with the modulation
of feeding behaviour and corporal growth due to its ability to
detect changes in blood glucose. It has been proposed that
metabolic interactions between glial cells and neurons may
be required for glucose sensing in the brain a short time after
feeding. Thus the glycolytic metabolism of glucose by glial
cells and transfer of lactate to neighbouring neurons may
lead to enhanced ATP synthesis in the latter and thus
contribute to the closure of KATP
channels (Ainscow et al.,
2002).
Hypothalamic neurons are associated with highly elon-
gated glial cells, namely tanycytes. There are four different
types of tanycytes, a1, a2, b1 and b2 (Akmayev and Popov,
1977). The a2- and b1-tanycytes are localized in the lower
lateral wall of the third ventricle and develop cell processes
that contact neurons in the arcuate nucleus as well as
capillaries in the hypothalamus (Garcia et al., 2001). Thus
periventricular hypothalamic tanycytes, which contact the
CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and the neuronal soma, may
metabolically couple neurons from the arcuate and the
ventromedial nucleus, regulating glucose-sensing activities.
We demonstrated that GLUT2 (glucose transporter 2) is
expressed in tanycytes; however, we observed a reduced
hybridization and immunohistochemical reactivity of GLUT2
in neuronal soma, indicating low-to-absent expression of
GLUT2 in arcuate nucleus neurons (Garcia et al., 2003). The
expression of GLUT2 in a- and b-tanycytes suggests that
tanycytes contacting ventromedial hypothalamic neurons (a)
and arcuate nucleus neurons (b) are involved in glucose
uptake using the same low-affinity transporter. In both types
of cells, the localization of GLUT2 is observed in the proximal
pole of tanycytes, which contacts the CSF (Garcia et al.,
2003). Thus tanycytes may be primarily involved in detecting
glucose concentration in the CSF of the ventricular system.
Similar localization of GLUT2 and GK (glucokinase) has been
detected in ependymal cells of the cerebral aqueduct and
dorsal third ventricle (Maekawa et al., 2000), indicating that

different cells facing the ventricular system may be involved
in glucose sensing.
GK plays a fundamental role in glucose homoeostasis,
catalysing the high-Km
phosphorylation of glucose in different
tissues involved in glucose sensing. Glucose is transported by
GLUT2, which has a high Km
for glucose, and then glucose is
phosphorylated by GK or hexokinase IV. GK has a low affinity
for phosphorylating glucose (Km
510­15 mM), and the enzyme
is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate. Mice lacking b-cell
GK die within 3 days of birth from acute hyperglycaemia (Bali
et al., 1995; Terauchi et al., 1995). Hepatic GK is regulated at
a post-translational level through binding to GKRP (GK
regulatory protein), which functions as an anchor protein,
modulating GK activity and mediating its nuclear translocation
(Vandercammen and Van Schaftingen, 1990, 1991). In
normoglycaemia, GK is detected in both the nuclei and
cytoplasm of parenchymal cells (Toyoda et al., 1995a). GK
mRNA was selectively identified by RT (reverse transcription)­
PCR as well as in situ hybridization in rat hypothalamus (Kang
et al., 2004, 2006; Yang et al., 1999). At the protein level,
immunoblotting and enzyme assays have confirmed the
presence of GK in rat and human hypothalamic extracts
(Roncero et al., 2000, 2004). GK is expressed in the
hypothalamus, regulating reproductive function, glucocorticoid
secretion, food intake and hypothalamic gene expression (Yang
et al., 2007). Thus GK plays a key role in the neuroendocrine
regulation of metabolic economy. Kang et al. (2006) confirmed
that GK is a critical regulator of neuronal activity in freshly
dissociated ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus neurons.
The hypothesis that the hypothalamus can detect changes
in glucose levels requires the identification of the cells
involved in this process. Consequently, the aim of the present
study was to study whether tanycytes express GK and to
define its subcellular distribution in the hypothalamic
periventricular region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
WeusedadultSprague­Dawleyrats.TheAnimal Experimentation
Committee at the University of Concepcion, Faculty of Biological
Science, approved all animal experiments.
Immunocytochemistry
Rat brain samples (Sprague­Dawley) were dissected and
fixed directly by immersion in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde
(12 h) or cold (220°C) methanol (2 h). Thick transverse
sections (40 mm) were cut with a cryostat, and the sections
were processed free-floating. For immunohistochemical co-
localization analyses, we used the following antibodies and
dilutions: anti-GLUT2 (1:100, Alpha Diagnostic International,
San Antonio, TX, U.S.A.), rabbit anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein; Dako, Campintene, CA, U.S.A.), mouse anti-
vimentin (1:100; Boehringer­Mannheim, Mannheim,
Germany), rabbit anti-GK (1:50, sc7908; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.), and sheep anti-GK
(1:200, provided by Dr Mark Magnuson, Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN, U.S.A.). Sections were incubated
with the antibodies overnight at 20°C in a humid chamber.
The antibodies were diluted in a Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8)
containing 8.4 mM sodium phosphate, 3.5 mM potassium
phosphate, 120 mM NaCl and 1% BSA. After extensive
washing, the liver or pancreas sections were incubated for 2
h at 20°C with peroxidase-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (1:100;
Dako). The peroxidase activity was developed using a DAB
(diaminobenzidine) substrate kit (ImmunoPure; Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). For immunofluores-
cence and co-localization analyses, the brain tissues were
incubated with the primary antibodies overnight and
additionally with Cy2- or Cy3-labelled secondary antibodies
(1:200; Jackson Immuno Research). These samples were
counterstained with the DNA stain, Topro-3 (Invitrogen,
Rockville, MD, U.S.A.). The slides were analysed using
confocal laser microscopy (D-Eclipse C1 Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan).
Ultrastructural immunohistochemistry
Brain tissues were immersed for 2 h in a fixative containing
2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The samples were dehydrated in
dimethylformamide and embedded in London Resin Gold
(Electron Microscopy Science, Washington, DC, U.S.A.).
Ultrathin sections were mounted on uncoated nickel grids
and processed for immunocytochemistry (Peruzzo et al.,
2000). For immunostaining, rabbit anti-GK antibody was
diluted 1:100 in Tris/HCl (pH 7.8) buffer containing 8.4 mM
sodium phosphate, 3.5 mM potassium phosphate, 120 mM
NaCl and 1% BSA. After extensive washing, the ultrathin
sections were incubated for 2 h at 20°C with 10-nm
colloidal gold-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (1:20). Uranyl
acetate/lead citrate was used as contrast, and samples
were analysed using a Hitachi H-700 electron microscope
with 125­200 kV accelerating voltage.
In situ hybridization
A PCR product of 510 bp obtained from the hypothalamus
was subcloned into pCR-4-Blunt-TOPO (Clontech, Palo Alto,
CA, U.S.A.) and was used to generate sense and antisense DIG
(digoxigenin)-labelled riboprobes. RNA probes were labelled
with DIG-UTP by in vitro transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA
polymerase by following the manufacturer's procedure
(Boehringer­Mannheim). In situ hybridization was performed
on rat frontal brain sections mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated
glass slides (Garcia et al., 2005). The sections were baked at
60°C for 1 h, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in

graded ethanol. After proteinase K treatment (5 min at 37°C
in PBS, 1 mg/ml), the tissue sections were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 5 min, washed in cold PBS and
then acetylated with 0.1 M triethanolamine/HCl (pH 8.0) and
0.25% acetic anhydride at 20°C for 10 min. After a brief wash,
the sections were incubated in pre-hybridization solution at
37°C for 30 min and then 25 ml of a hybridization mixture
[50% formamide, 0.6 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1
mM EDTA, 16 Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll 400/0.02%
polyvinylpyrrolidone/0.02% BSA), 10% poly(ethylene glycol)
8000, 10 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 500 mg of yeast tRNA/ml,
50 mg/ml heparin, 500 mg/ml DNA carrier and 1:20 to 1:100
dilutions of riboprobe] were added to each slide. The slides
were covered with glass coverslips and placed in a humidified
chamber at 42°C overnight. After the removal of the
coverslips, the slides were rinsed in 46 SSC (16 SSC is
0.15 M NaCl/0.015 M sodium citrate) and washed twice for 30
min at 42°C. The slides were washed at 37°C for 30 min each
in 26 SSC, 16 SSC and 0.36 SSC. Visualization of DIG was
performed by incubation with a monoclonal antibody
coupled with alkaline phosphatase (anti-DIG alkaline phos-
phatase Fab fragments diluted 1:500; Boehringer­Mannheim)
at 20°C for 2 h. Nitro Blue Tetrazolium and BCIP (5-bromo-4-
chloroindol-3-yl phosphate; Boehringer­Mannheim) were
used as substrates for the alkaline phosphatase. Controls
included the use of the sense riboprobe and omission of the
probe.
RT­PCR
The brain of each rat was removed and the hypothalamic area
was taken out and further dissected until a region close to the
ependymal layer was obtained, and total RNA was isolated using
TRIzolH (Invitrogen). For RT­PCR, 1 mg of RNA was incubated in a
10 ml reaction volume containing 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 50
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2
, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mM dNTPs,
2.5 mM of oligo(dT) primers, and 50 units of MuLV (murine
leukaemia virus) reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.) for 10 min at 23°C followed by 30 min at
42°C and 5 min at 94°C. Parallel reactions were performed in the
absence of reverse transcriptase to control for the presence of
contaminant DNA. For amplification, a cDNA aliquot in a volume
of 12.5 ml containing 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.6
mM MgCl2
, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.04 unit of Taq DNA polymerase
(Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and 0.4 mM primers was
incubated at 94°C for 4 min, 94°C for 15­50 s, 55°C for 30­50 s
and 72°C for 30­135 s for 35 cycles. PCR products were
separated by 1.2­1.5% agarose-gel electrophoresis and visua-
lized by staining with ethidium bromide. The following set of
primers was used to analyse the expression of GK: sense 59-
AAAGATGTTGCCCACCTACGTGCG-39 and antisense 59-
ATCATGCCGACCTCACATTGGC-39 (expected product of 510 bp).
Additionally, the following set of primers was used to analyse
the expression of b-actin: sense 59-GCTGCTCGTCGACAACGGCTC
and antisense 59-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-39 (expected
product 353 bp).
Real-time PCR
RNA samples were treated with DNase I before reverse
transcription processing to remove genomic DNA contamina-
tion. A total of 2 mg of RNA from each sample was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScriptTM III first-strand
synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
suggested protocol. QRT­PCR (quantitative RT­PCR) reactions
were prepared with a LightCycler reaction kit in a final volume
of 20 ml containing 2 ml of 250 ng of reverse-transcribed total
RNA, 500 nM of primers, 4 mM MgCl2
and 2 ml of LightCycler
FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science).
PCR reactions were carried out in capillaries in a LightCycler 2.0
instrument (Roche Applied Science Biosystem, Forster, CA,
U.S.A.) and were cycled 40 times. The following set of primers
was used to analyse the expression of the housekeeping gene,
cyclophilin: sense 59-TGGAGATGAATCTGTAGGAGGAG-39 and
antisense 59-TACCACATCCATGCCCTCTAGAA-39 (expected
product of 382 bp). The primers used to detect GK mRNA
expression were the same as those used for non-quantitative
PCR. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of a pre-
incubation for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation for 10 s at 95°C, annealing for 5 s at 55°C and
extension for 10 s at 72°C. All experiments were done in
triplicate to verify the results. The relative expression of GK
mRNA to cyclophilin mRNA was calculated using the 22DDCt
method. The statistical analysis was performed using Prism
version 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
U.S.A.). GK expression in each group was compared using the
Kruskal­Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA).
Immunoblotting
Total protein extracts were obtained from rat periventri-
cular hypothalamus, liver and pancreas by homogenizing
the tissue in buffer A (0.3 mM sucrose, 3 mM DTT, 1 mM
EDTA, 100 mg/ml PMSF, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml
leucopeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin) and sonicating on ice
at 300 W (VCF1, Sonics and Material ) three times for 10 s
and centrifuging at 4000 g for 10 min. Proteins were
resolved by SDS/PAGE (70 mg per lane) in a 5­15% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membranes (0.45
mm pore, Amersham Biosciences., Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.),
and probed with rabbit anti-GK or sheep anti-GK
antibodies. The reaction was developed using the ECLH
Western-blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Nuclear extract preparation
To analyse the subcellular localization of GK in situ,
hypothalamic nuclear extracts were prepared using the
following protocol. Unicellular suspensions were obtained
from the dissected tissues by trypsinization followed by
disruption in ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors, DNase I,
3 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. Cells were collected after
centrifugation at 700 g for 5 min and resuspended in
GK expression in the hypothalamus

ice-cold lysis buffer for 10 min. After centrifugation at 850
g for 1 min, the cell pellets were resuspended in hypo-
osmotic buffer (10 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM MgCl2
and 10 mM
KCl, pH 7.9). The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at
4600 g (Micromax RF centrifugue; IEC) for 1 min, and the
nuclear pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (20
mM Hepes, 1.5 mM MgCl2
, 420 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and
20% glycerol, pH 7.9) and agitated on an orbital shaker at
maximum speed in a cold chamber for 45 min followed by
centrifugation at 9300 g for 5 min. Nuclear extract aliquots
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280°C. All
procedures following the cell disruption were performed on
ice or at 4°C. The purity of the nuclear extracts was
confirmed by Western-blot analysis using the antibody TFIIB
(transcription factor IIB; sc-225, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
a nuclear marker.
RESULTS
GK is expressed in the hypothalamus
The expression of GK in rat hypothalamus was analysed by
RT­PCR with primers specific for GK mRNA (Figure 1A, lane
1). The amplified DNA band was approx. 510 bp, which was
the expected size for the GK amplification product. The PCR
product was sequenced and showed 100% homology with
hepatic or pancreatic GK (results not shown). The PCR
conditions were optimized using RNA from rat liver and
pancreas as positive controls for GK expression (Figure 1A,
lanes 2 and 3) and spleen tissue as a negative control
(Figure 1A, lane 4) (Iynedjian et al., 1986; Waeber et al.,
1994). No amplification product was observed in samples of
hypothalamus in the absence of reverse transcriptase
(Figure 1A, lane 5). GK expression was also evaluated by
Western-blot analysis using protein extracts isolated from
rat liver, pancreas and hypothalamus. First, we verified the
reactivity of two different anti-GK antibodies (sheep and
rabbit) (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Both antibodies
recognized the same band (54 kDa) in liver extracts.
Additionally, a similar band was detected in pancreas and
hypothalamic protein extracts using rabbit anti-GK
(Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Rabbit anti-GK specificity was
further analysed by immunohistochemistry in control
tissues: liver, pancreas and insulinoma INS-1 cells (see
Supplementary Figures S1A­S1G at http://www.asnneuro.
org/an/002/an002e035add.htm). Additionally, we demon-
strated that rabbit and sheep anti-GK antibodies showed
the same GK distribution in liver cells (Supplementary
Figures S1H­S1J). Thus sheep anti-GK was used to perform
GK and GLUT2 co-localization analyses in brain cells.
Cytoplasmic GK expression was confirmed in ventricular
ependymal cells (Figures 1D and 1G), which also express
GLUT2 localized in the cilia (Figures 1C and 1F).
Morphological characterization of tanycytes and
GK mRNA distribution
Prior to analysing GK in hypothalamic tissue, anti-vimentin
antibodies were used to define the exact localization of
tanycytes in the rat brain (Figure 2). Using confocal microscopy
analysis and Z-stack projection in the X­Y and X­Z planes
(Figure 2C), we observed strong immunoreaction for the anti-
vimentin antibodies in the periventricular bodies of cells and
processes that are in contact with the ventromedial (a) and
arcuate nucleus (b) neurons (Figures 2A­2C). Additionally,
ultrastructural analysis (Figures 2D­2F) confirmed the classical
morphological characteristics of ventricular b-tanycytes:
namely microvilli and bleb projections in the apical region
of cells (Figures 2D and 2E) and long processes that are in
direct contact with hypothalamic neurons (Figure 2F,
arrows). This structural association is essential for glia­
neuron metabolic interaction. Scanning microscopy analysis
revealed the transition between ciliated ependymal cells and
tanycytes (Figures 2G­2I) with microvilli (a-tanycytes) or
blebs (b-tanycytes) in the apical membrane.
We analysed GK mRNA expression by in situ hybridization
using DIG-labelled cRNA probes specific for GK (Figures 3A­3F).
A positive hybridization signal concentrated in the region facing
the third ventricle was detected in both a and b hypothalamic
tanycytes (Figures 3C­3E). Although neurons showed a very low
hybridization signal, the signal was not concentrated in the
arcuate or the ventromedial nucleus (Figures 3D and 3F). The
reaction detected in tanycytes was completely abolished when
the sense probe was used (Figure 3B).
Optic and ultrastructural analyses of nuclear and
cytosolic GK distributions in hypothalamic
tanycytes
To establish the precise localization of GK in the hypothal-
amus of adult rats, immunocytochemical detection and
confocal microscopy analyses were employed (Figure 4).
Intense anti-GK immunoreactivity was detected in periven-
tricular glial cells co-expressing vimentin (Figures 4A and 4B).
A weaker reaction was observed in some hypothalamic
neurons (Figure 4A); however, astrocytes and endothelial cells
were negative (Figures 4E­4L). Quantitative immunoreaction
analysis revealed that GK was preferentially expressed in
periventricular glial cells or tanycytes (Figure 4D). Addi-
tionally, we demonstrated that GK was preferentially
localized in tanycyte nuclei (Figures 4M­4O). A lower
immunoreaction was also detected in the tanycytes cytosol
(Figure 4O and the inset). In order to confirm GK nuclear
detection, Western-blot analysis was performed using nuclear
protein extracts isolated from the periventricular hypothal-
amus. The purity of the nuclear extracts was confirmed using
anti-TFIIb (Figure 4P) and GK localization was confirmed by
using rabbit anti-GK.
Ultrastructural immunohistochemistry showed GK nuclear
localization in tanycytes (Figures 5C and 5D). GK was

detected in the apical region of the tanycytes (Figures 5A and
5B); however, the blebs and microvilli were almost negative.
To confirm the apical localization of GK as well as GLUT2 and
GK co-distribution in tanycytes, we used confocal microscopy
analysis and Z-stack projection to increase the positive GK
signal (Figure 6). A diffuse GLUT2 distribution was detected in
tanycytes (Figures 6A and 6D); however, most of the cells
showed stronger immunoreactivity in the apical region
(Figure 6D). After Z-stack projection analysis, GK immunor-
eaction was clearly detected in the nuclei as well as the apical
region of tanycytes (Figures 6B and 6E). GK and GLUT2 co-
localization was mainly detected in the apical region of the
cells but not in the nucleus (Figures 6C and 6F).
Additionally, immunofluorescent staining and confocal
microscopy were used to demonstrate broad GK distribution
in different hypothalamic regions (Supplementary Figure S2
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/002/an002e035add.htm).
GK is induced during post-natal development in
hypothalamic tanycytes
GK levels during post-natal development were assessed by
immunohistochemistry and RT­PCR analyses (Figure 7). The
intensity of the GK immunoreactivity markedly increased
during the second week of post-natal development; on day
10 of the post-natal period, positive GK immunoreaction was

tion was mainly detected in vimentin-positive cells, confirm-
ing GK expression in tanycytes (Figures 7D, 7H and 7L). On

carried out (Figure 7N). Whereas GK was initially present in
the hypothalamus at equivalent levels for the first 5 days,
additional brain post-natal development was accompanied by
a marked increase in the amount of GK. Specifically, on days
10 and 15, the amount of GK mRNA was approx. 3- and 8-
fold greater than that on day 1 respectively.
DISCUSSION
Different hypothalamic areas as well as others regions within
the brain, specifically the area postrema, medulla oblongata
and tractus solitarius nucleus, are believed to have glucose-
sensing mechanisms that modulate feeding behaviour
(Frizzell et al., 1993; Leloup et al., 1998; Roncero et al.,
2004; Schwartz et al., 2000; Wan et al., 1998). Similar to b-
cells of the pancreas, previous studies indicate that GK and
GLUT2 expression in these brain areas is essential to detect
changes in blood glucose concentration (Bady et al., 2006;
Leloup et al., 1998; Lynch et al., 2000; Maekawa et al., 2000;
Marty et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007).
In situ hybridization analysis has revealed GK and GLUT2
expression in a region of the hypothalamus containing neurons
and ependymal cells (Lynch et al., 2000; Navarro et al., 1996;
Yang et al., 1999). However, the low resolution capacity of the
radioautographic detection of the GK probe prevented
identification of the cell types expressing GK and GLUT2. The
in situ non-isotopic hybridization carried out in the present
study clearly identifies a- and b-tanycytes as the main
hypothalamic cells positive for GK expression; however, a
reduced hybridization signal in neuronal soma (arcuate
nucleus) was also detected. Additionally, we performed a
detailed immunohistochemical analysis of GK expression in rat
hypothalamic tanycytes using two different antibodies that
showed the same pattern of immunostaining. The tanycyte
subpopulation expressing GK and GLUT2 was also identified. As

observed in liver cells, optic and ultrastructural microscopic
analyses showed preferential GK immunoreaction in the
nucleus of a- and b-tanycytes. In pancreas and insulinoma
ISN-1 cells, GK was not detected in the nucleus; positive
immunostaining was observed only in the cytoplasm, con-
firming the specificity of GK antibodies. Other hypothalamic
cells, such as astrocytes and endothelial cells, were consistently
negative for GK immunoreactivity; however, some neurons in
the arcuate nuclei were positive for GK. To increase GK
detection, we used 40 mm slides for confocal laser microscopy
and Z-stack projection, confirming nuclear GK distribution as
well as its localization in the apical cytoplasmic region of
tanycytes and ependymal cells of the third ventricle.
Our results are consistent with initial immunocytochemical
analyses of GK expression, which revealed that this protein has
a wide distribution in the ependymal cells of ventricular
cavities (Maekawa et al., 2000). GK and GLUT2 expression has
been localized in ciliated ependymal cells of the cerebral
ventricles, specifically in the cell membrane of the cilia
(Maekawa et al., 2000), which is similar to our results. However,
no immunoreaction was observed in the low wall of the third
ventricle, the tanycytes region. It is possible that the difference
could be attributed to the use of different antibodies. The
antibodies used in the present study recognize pancreatic and
hepatic GK; however, the antibody used by Maekawa et al.
(2000) reacted specifically with the pancreatic isoform.
Nuclear GK localization in tanycytes strongly suggests GKRP
co-expression in these cells. Alvarez et al. (2002) demonstrated
GKRP expression in the hypothalamus; GKRP mRNA was
detected in the periventricular nucleus. However, a detailed

analysis of the hybridization signal strongly suggests a positive
reaction in glial periventricular cells. Therefore subcellular
translocation of GK may regulate its activity in tanycytes in
accordance with the metabolic needs of the cell.
Using rat hypothalamic slices, Sanz et al. (2007) reported
GK expression and functional activity in ventromedial
hypothalamus and lateral hypothalamus areas. They also
analysed the effects of glucose and insulin on GK activity in
rat hypothalamus and demonstrated that GK activity was
modified by these molecules. Additionally, they postulated
that altered GK activity may be associated with specific cells
in defined brain areas. Because tanycytes express GK and are
in contact with ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic
neurons, tanycytes may also modify GK activity.
In the periventricular hypothalamus, the interaction
between hypothalamic neurons and glial periventricular cells
may be necessary for glucose sensing. Our previous study
revealed that astrocytes were absent from areas containing
a- and b1-tanycytes. In the hypothalamus, tanycytes are the
primary glial cell in contact with the CSF, blood and neurons
(Garcia et al., 2001). Therefore the expression of GLUT2 and
GK in hypothalamic tanycytes may have important physio-
logical consequences. An elevated Km
for glucose transport
and the presence of GK imply that tanycytes increase their
glucose uptake rate in direct proportion to extracellular
changes in glucose concentration. This property of GLUT2 and
GK determines their participation in the glucose-sensing
mechanism of pancreatic b-cells (Guillam et al., 1997, 2000;
Iynedjian, 2009; Schuit et al., 2001; Yang et al., 1999).
Therefore GLUT2 and GK may play a similar role in
hypothalamic tanycytes. Sanders et al. (2004) injected
alloxan, a GK inhibitor and toxin, into the third ventricle,
demonstrating that treated rats exhibited impaired feeding
behaviour and blood glucose concentration. These impaired
responses were associated with the destruction of third
ventricle tanycytes, neuronal swelling and decreased arcuate
nucleus neuropeptide Y mRNA. However, 2 weeks after

alloxan injection, third ventricle tanycyte destruction was
reversed; this was accompanied by restoration of feeding and
hyperglycaemic responses to both systemic and hindbrain
glucoprivation. Interestingly, in genetic complementation
experiments in which a GLUT2 cDNA was expressed in
Ripglut1;glut22/2 mice under the control of the GFAP (glial-
specific) or the synapsin (neuron-specific) promoters,
counter-regulation was restored only when GLUT2 was
expressed in glial cells (Marty et al., 2005). According to a
previously published hypothesis, the glia cell may take up
glucose through GLUT2, catabolize it to lactate and transfer
lactate to neurons via monocarboxylate transporters for
production of ATP through further degradation by the
tricarboxylic acid cycle (Ainscow et al., 2002).
GK levels were strongly up-regulated during the second
week of post-natal development. This suggests that GK
functional activity is increased when the blood­brain barrier
reaches the mature level with the weaning (Vorbrodt et al.,
2001). In the second week, GK was broadly distributed in the
cytoplasm of the tanycytes but not in the nucleus. A similar
subcellular distribution has been observed in liver cells.
Before day 11 post-partum, only some hepatocytes were
immunostained, and a positive reaction was found in the
cytoplasm but not in the nucleus of the cells (Toyoda et al.,
1995b). These results suggest that nuclear compartmentaliza-
tion may be associated with post-natal GKRP co-expression, a
condition that has not been analysed in hypothalamic
tanycytes or liver cells.
