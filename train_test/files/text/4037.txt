Fracking: Minding the gaps
Joanne Hawkins
University of Bristol, UK
Abstract
Fracking, an extraction technique for unconventional oil and gas, has proved highly controversial in England,
with environmental and health impacts being a central concern. Although the topic has been widely debated,
such debate has focused on the pros and cons of the technique and little attention or literature has focused on
the current regulatory system. At present, uncertainty surrounds numerous aspects of the extraction
technique and the promotion of fracking in England is largely founded on the assumption that a strong
regulatory system is already in place to control any impacts. This article will examine the current suites of
regulation and will highlight the gaps that are present within the existing European Union (EU) and national
controls and their connection to potential environmental and public health damage. Such an examination
will consider legislation as well as the ability of regulators in England to act. This article will show that, at
present, the system governing fracking is far from satisfactory. In light of this, the regulatory approaches
now available will be evaluated and the need for a more precautionary approach to regulation highlighted.

Introduction
With energy demand rising and UK home-grown energy sources dwindling, the prospect of a wealth of
shale gas under our very feet is an understandably tempting prospect. However, the extraction of such
`unconventional' gas is not without its issues, particularly the technique of hydraulic fracturing ­ commonly
known as fracking ­ which is used to release it. Current literature surrounding shale gas exploration in
England has focused on examining the positive and negative consequences associated with the develop-
ment of such an industry.1 Only brief comment has been made on the state of the current English regu-
lation.2 Since the shale gas industry is at a critical stage of development in England, examining the

corresponding regulatory and legal frameworks which will govern the industry's development is impera-
tive. The focus of this article will be upon the regulatory framework and role of authorities in England; as
such, it will not be a comparative piece.
Whilst there have been arguments based on the assertion that fracking is, in fact, not a new technology,
such arguments are misleading as technological advances and changes in intensity and depth mean that, in
the present context, the current fracking techniques are novel. The relationship between regulation and
new technologies is something that is apparent, but not unique, in relation to fracking. The issue of reg-
ulatory gaps and the imposition of controls after the event is a problem that can be seen in relation to other
novel technologies such as genetically modified organisms and nano-technology.3 In the context of frack-
ing, the time and political pressure for development, due to energy supply and energy security demands,
highlights the tensions and problems that can emerge in the relationship between the law and novel tech-
nologies. For reasons of space, this aspect is not a core concern of this article, but is worthy of further
future study.
The first part of this article outlines what fracking is and the concerns associated with it. An examination
of the current regulatory gaps and uncertainties will then be undertaken. The final part of this article will
examine how the regulation of fracking should proceed, highlighting the options available and demonstrat-
ing the benefits of a temporary moratorium whilst a more precautionary approach to the regulation is
developed.
What is hydraulic fracturing/fracking?
Fracking is the extraction technique for natural gas or oil found within unconventional resources such as
shale formations. Artificial fractures are created by injecting wells at high pressure with water, tracers (that
allow the fracturing fluids to be tracked), chemical additives (such as friction reducers) and proppants
(which keep the created fractures open allowing the gas released to flow).4 The resources are unconven-
tional because the oil and gas trapped within them is not recoverable using conventional methods. Addi-
tional stimulation techniques are required, hence the use of fracking. To conduct onshore shale gas
exploration involving fracking in England the following process must be followed. Petroleum Exploration
and Development Licences (PEDL) for shale gas exploration are obtained through licensing rounds, plan-
ning permission is then sought for a particular exploration site, relevant permits are obtained from the Envi-
ronment Agency, an independent well inspection is arranged and notification to drill given to the Health and
Safety Executive. Monitoring plans are then agreed before consent to drill is awarded by the Department of
Energy and Climate Change (DECC), followed by the submission of a hydraulic fracturing plan which,
when approved, sees consent to fracture awarded.5 Hydraulic fracturing by shale gas exploration companies
first took place in England in 2011.6
Hydraulic fracturing does not have a fixed or commonly shared meaning. Fracking only comprises one
part of the process of shale gas extraction, but this is not always how the term is used and variations in the
use of the term can account for miscommunications between stakeholders. The general meaning attached by

members of the industry is that of the actual process of injecting wells at high pressure to fracture the rock
formation. However, outside the industry, the term is used to cover the whole process of shale gas extraction
from the drilling of a wellbore to the underground injection and, even further, to the abandonment of the
well at the end of its life.7 The definition is crucial as a number of concerns associated with fracking are
not tied solely to the technical underground injection, but are related to other practices associated with
extraction. It is only through looking at the process as a whole, from design through to abandonment, that
this article can effectively evaluate the control system currently in place. As such, the term fracking will be
used to cover the entire process of exploration and utilisation unless otherwise stated.
Key issues with fracking
Fracking has enabled the exploitation of previously inaccessible gas resources, giving rise to a boom in US
shale gas production and a fall in gas prices. Although a corresponding fall in prices here in England/the UK
is unlikely,8 the potential tax revenue and increased security of supply are proving to be driving factors in
government policy. However, concerns surrounding fracking have been raised and these have both environ-
mental and health implications. At present, public opposition to fracking poses a potentially significant bar-
rier to the development of a UK shale gas industry.9 The absence of social acceptance or approval of
fracking in turn means the absence of a social licence to operate. Following the anti-fracking protests at the
exploration site in Balcombe in the summer of 2013, there has been a noticeably negative impact on public
perceptions of shale gas.10 A detailed examination of the role of a social licence to operate is beyond the scope
of this article and as such will not be discussed in detail here. Notably, however, in many ways the concerns
expressed are not new and mirror concerns with other energy sources, both traditional and renewable.
Water. One of the prime concerns with fracking, for the environment and public health, is its potential link to
water contamination. There are a number of facets to this concern. The first is the risk of migration into
groundwater of pollutants within the fracturing fluid, potentially polluting natural substances and methane
gases through the fractures created. Due to the height to which fractures extend and the low porosity of shale
in the absence of pressure conditions (that is, fracking), contamination through these methods is considered
unlikely.11 Additional concerns which may have more of a scientific basis surround the migration of gas
released during fracking, fracking fluids and polluting natural substances due to inadequate well integrity,
and the impact of surface spills.12 Finally, there are concerns over the volume of water used during fracking.
At present the recycling of water is not common practice (this may change if production begins)13 and the

supply of freshwater required (approximately 15,000m3 during the entire fracturing process into a well) is a
significant problem, particularly in drier areas.14
Air quality. Pollution concerns are not confined to water impacts, but also extend to the effect fracking sites
will have on air quality. Emissions from machinery and gaseous escape from flaring raise issues for local air
quality and the effects on the local environment/health from exposure. In addition, fracking brings into
question wider issues relating to whether exploiting more fossil fuel is compatible with the UK's binding
climate change targets.15
Seismic activity. Another concern, especially after the tremors near Blackpool in 2011, is the risk of seismic
activity, particularly in areas where natural geological faults lie. Fracking at this exploration site saw a num-
ber of seismic events with a maximum magnitude of 2.3M, and triggered a temporary moratorium on frack-
ing in England.16
Current regulation17
Reports, such as those conducted by the Royal Society and Public Health England, have expressed the
opinion that if a `robust' regulatory system is in place the risks associated with fracking can be reduced
and controlled. Such claims have been repeated by political figures.18 The next section discusses whether
the assumption that a `robust' regulatory system exists in England is justified by examining whether cur-
rent controls effectively translate and map onto the operation of a new technology and industry in
England.
The government insists that current regulation for conventional oil and gas extraction is adequate to con-
trol fracking.19 However, these controls were designed pre-fracking and, as will be discussed, whilst current
oil and gas regulations do not fail to offer any relevant controls, their application leaves a number of gaps
which may risk harm to human health and/or damage to the environment. The emergence of such gaps is not
surprising and has been seen in the regulation of other novel and new technologies.20 In addition, the lack of

English experience and expertise in relation to the regulation of fracking questions the ability of local
authorities and other regulators to deal with and monitor such developments, particularly when resources
are limited.21
Assertions that any risk to the environment and health from exposure to emissions related to fracking are
expected to be low are highly dependent on the `proper operation' of activities and the imposition of `proper
regulations'.22 As this article will show, this assumption regarding the current regulatory structure is mis-
placed and uncertainty renders defining `proper operation' standards problematic. Evidence of the inade-
quacy of a borrowed regulatory regime has already become apparent. Prior to the occurrence of seismic
tremors near Blackpool in 2011 there were no seismic controls in England. Although DECC has now imple-
mented regulation following a short suspension of fracking, this was only done in response to the materi-
alisation of the risk (i.e. the earthquake).23
With similar uncertainty surrounding other environmental risks associated with fracking, there is con-
cern that such a reactive approach will provide little consolation if damage to health or to the environment
has already occurred. The key question surrounding the concerns on shale gas exploration and fracking at
this early stage must be: how far do these risks and uncertainties coincide with the current regulatory gaps?
Environmental and health consequences must also be considered. What has happened so far with fracking
mirrors a number of other narratives in EU and UK environmental regulations where specific, targeted
controls have been imposed after the event, not before.24
The European Commission has recently published a Recommendation setting out the minimum princi-
ples for the exploration of oil and gas using fracking.25 Although the recognition that current EU regulation
fails to comprehensively cover fracking operations is welcome, Member States are only encouraged to
apply the non-binding suggestions. This fails to guarantee that the problem areas are addressed. As such,
this article focuses on the existing enforceable regulatory controls on shale gas exploration under EU and
English law whilst considering how the recent EU Recommendation impacts on their operation. The fol-
lowing section examines the use of conventional oil and gas regulation in the context of fracking and the
affect this has had on the regulatory protection offered.
Regulatory mismatch
Current conventional oil and gas regulation fails to translate into adequate controls for the shale gas industry
and fracking leading to a regulatory mismatch and uncertainty over if and how regulations apply. Regula-
tion is dependent on existing controls in a wide number of sectors and media: laws on waste, water quality,
air quality, environmental impacts and liability, chemical controls, noise emissions, planning and

development controls. The current regime is not conducive to clarity and consistency. The following section
discusses this mis-match in further detail.
Water. The emergence of regulatory gaps is clearly evident when the controls on fracking and water are
examined. There is no guarantee that a borehole passing through groundwater will require a permit under
the Environmental Permitting Regulation.26 This is due to the fact that many chemicals used in drilling
muds27 and fracturing fluids are categorised as non-pollutants (pollutants being defined as any substance
liable to cause pollution, in particular those listed in Annex VIII of the Water Framework Directive
(WFD)).28 This means that their direct injection into groundwater is not controlled, despite the fact this may
ultimately impact on groundwater quality and aquifers. In addition, with many of the chemicals used in
fracking only assumed to be non-hazardous based on current information, there is a risk that inadequate
controls will be applied as such chemicals do not currently fall under the hazardous or priority substances
listed under the WFD.29
Failure in regulatory translation is again apparent due to the present lack of control on water abstrac-
tion.30 These controls limit the amount of groundwater an operator can extract for industrial purposes. Such
controls are, however, rendered ineffective due to the current sourcing of water supplies from local utility
operators. Water supply moves beyond legislative controls, becoming an issue of utility provider policy on
water allocation and priority.
Chemicals. As detailed above, the chemicals used in fracking are not necessarily regulated via a ground-
water permit. Nor are they effectively regulated via dedicated chemicals regulation. REACH, the regu-
lation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, is the EU flagship regime
for chemicals risk assessment and management. As downstream users (that is, users of chemicals in an
industrial process), registration of new usages of chemicals is key in ensuring appropriate risk manage-
ment and exposure scenarios are considered. Despite the `new use' of chemicals during fracking, an
assessment of registration dossiers found that neither hydraulic fracturing nor shale gas were explicitly
mentioned.31 In addition, the current description system for chemical use does not provide a suitable cate-
gory to describe the use of chemicals in fracking. Compounding these gaps is the fact that none of the
investigated dossiers explicitly quantified potential releases into the environment and associated environ-
mental exposure. Where they did, it was in relation to marine surface waters which are not relevant to
English onshore fracking.32 There is a clear need for alteration of the controls/descriptors available. With-
out such alteration the controls offered by REACH will not operate effectively. The recent EU recommen-
dation emphasises that registration of chemicals used in fracking is required to comply with REACH

(operators being downstream users), but it does nothing to address the inappropriate descriptors and mod-
els currently available in the registration process.33
Waste. The classification of fracking fluids and drilling muds as non-hazardous is based on assumptions
from current information. This is of particular concern when the controls offered by the Mining Waste
Directive (MWD) are considered.34 The MWD should govern the way in which waste from fracking oper-
ations is dealt with. However, it is not clear whether fracturing fluids that remain underground whilst the
site is still active will be discarded for the purposes of the directive. As such they may only be subject to
directive controls when operations at the site are suspended or wells abandoned.
Regulatory mis-match is once again visible when the supposed role of Best Available Techniques
(BATs)/Best Available Techniques Reference Documents (BREFs) under the Industrial Emissions
Directive (IED) is considered.35 Such documents are used to improve industrial practices and avoid/
reduce emissions and the impact of installations on the environment. However, with uncertainty as to
whether the IED applies to fracking, and with no such BREF documents existing for the treatment of
fracking waste or for drilling equipment (even if the IED is applicable), their role in controlling opera-
tions is redundant. The EU Recommendation emphasises that risk assessment should be based on BAT
and BREF, but does nothing to fill the gap where no such documents exist. Notably, as part of the policy ini-
tiative, the Commission has pledged to review the BREF on extractive waste in light of fracking operations
(although this is not contained in the Recommendation).36 In addition, as a result of fracking waste, some shale
gas operators are likely to classify their sites as mining waste facilities.37 Facility categorisation affects the
relevant prevention and emergency plans in place; with uncertainties over the classification of Category A
waste facilities there is a risk of inadequate waste controls and safeguards if the appropriate category is not
applied.
Emissions. There is uncertainty over whether the IED will apply (shale gas and fracking are not mentioned
and do not necessarily qualify under hazardous waste/combustion capacity criteria).38 This brings into ques-
tion whether a permit under the IED will be necessary.39 If no permit is needed, monitoring requirements of
emissions to air, water and land, including measures concerning waste, may not be applied. The impact on
local air quality is also compounded by the absence of emission limits for non-road mobile machinery above
560 kW used on fracking sites.40

Inappropriate thresholds. The imposition of inappropriate thresholds is another problem which has previously
been an issue in relation to other novel and new technologies.41 This section focuses on current EU and
English legislation whilst planning controls will be discussed further in the subsequent section.
When looking at controls on safety, Seveso II (which requires operators handling dangerous substances
to have a major accident prevention policy) is unlikely to apply as the storage of hydrocarbon products fails
to reach the relevant threshold.42
The unsuitability of these thresholds can also be seen under the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) Directive, which was created to ensure that projects likely to have a significant impact on the envi-
ronment are subject to environmental assessment prior to development. However, exploratory sites can
fall short of the national threshold (i.e. 1 hectare or the extraction of more than 500,000 cubic meters of
gas per day), meaning that assessment is discretionary rather than mandatory.43 With the assessment of
health impacts by the Health Protection Authority only undertaken after an approach by a Local Authority
or as part of the EIA process, the absence of an EIA has clear implications for the environment and
health.44 Whilst the EU recommendation emphasises the need for an EIA, its retention of the directive
as the basis for requiring such an assessment means that inappropriate mandatory EIA thresholds are not
altered.
The absence of any provision for automatic remediation of any environmental damage is also proble-
matic. The EU Environmental Liability Directive (ELD), operating on the `polluter pays' principle, imposes
strict liability for activities classed as dangerous and listed under Annex III.45 At present, shale gas oper-
ations are not included, meaning that fault or negligence is required to attribute liability for environmental
damage. In the United States, it has been extremely difficult to assign responsibility for claimed environ-
mental damage from fracking operations. The fault/negligence burden in England looks set to be a signif-
icant hurdle to remediation if environmental damage does occur.46
When discussing thresholds, it is not possible to ignore the implications of UK climate change targets.
Whilst it is not the purpose of this article to engage in wider debates as to the merits of extracting shale
gas, in considering the fit of regulatory controls, if a large-scale industry is to develop here in England, the
80% reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels) looks
problematic.47
Having examined the current regulation on shale gas and fracking, it is clear that the inherent problem
lies in the fact that old regulations are being used to govern a new technology. This results in inappropriate
thresholds, the failure of controls to apply (or lack of clarity as to whether they apply) and the absence of
required guidance documents such as BREFs. Clearly, the existing controls offer some regulatory protec-
tion, but that should not obscure the fact that there are gaps in the present system.

Lack of English experience
The number of authorities involved and lack of English experience in regulating fracking is of significance.
Although the presence of multiple regulators can provide a system of checks and balances, it can also
exacerbate the risk of regulatory gaps.48
This is a point of particular concern in England. The authorities involved in regulating fracking range
from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) through to the Local Mineral Authority
(LA/usually the County Council), the Environment Agency (EA) and the Health and Safety Executive
(HSE). Broadly, DECC is responsible for the initial licence grant (Petroleum Exploration and Development
Licence/PEDL), for approval of the hydraulic fracturing plan and agreed method for monitoring induced
seismicity, consent to drill, consent to fracture and consent for an extended well test. The LA takes respon-
sibility for screening and defining the scope of an EIA (if applicable), determining the planning application
and planning conditions. The EA controls the environmental permits which fracking operations may
require, whilst the HSE takes responsibility for well design, integrity and operational safety. In reality
however, many of these aspects overlap.
One of the key issues stemming from the current structure is regulators' lack of relevant experience and
knowledge. This is of particular significance to LAs whose general planning experience ill-equips them to
deal with fracking applications. The role of LAs is further questioned by the community incentive scheme
and Council retention of 100 % of business rates from exploration sites and through their role in the EIA
process.49 The self-scoping of EIA issues by operators, combined with the LAs' limited experience in deal-
ing with shale gas operations, risks important issues being excluded from consideration.
Although the above issues are of particular relevance to LAs, it must be noted that planning applications
are also subject to consultation both by statutory (e.g. the EA) and non-statutory/relevant consultees as well
as the public. Accordingly, other bodies with relevant knowledge and experience are involved in the plan-
ning process. Bodies involved in regulation beyond the planning system also have significant knowledge of
and experience in related industries. In particular, the EA and HSE both have considerable experience in the
conventional oil and gas sector, with the HSE having a long history of regulating well integrity and design.
For both bodies involved in the planning and further regulatory stages, this experience and knowledge is of
great value, but it must be noted that, like the regulation, it cannot simply be transposed. This is evidenced
by recent calls from Public Health England (PHE) for further research into agencies' analytical capacities.50
In light of the current cut-backs, in many regulatory agencies the capacity of regulators to monitor the indus-
try is questionable. Lack of English expertise and understanding is a two-pronged issue: first, the authori-
ties' technical capacity to adequately control the industry; and second, the authorities' resources to ensure
that controls are implemented and enforced. These issues have been seen previously in other environmental
regimes such as that of contaminated land.51
Despite the absence of regulations specific to shale gas, planning guidance tailored to onshore oil and gas
exploration has been issued.52 Although aimed at ensuring clarity in the area, the document does add a

number of uncertainties and gaps to those already present within the regulations. The guidance, whilst not
replacing the LAs' judgement, is provided as a specific and detailed guidance tool on the relevant consid-
erations and requirements for those dealing with unconventional exploration applications. There are indi-
vidual issues within the guidance itself, as discussed below, but these are compounded by the presumption
that when granting planning permission `all other regulatory controls are to be considered fully functional
and effective'.53 As has been shown, there are clear gaps in the current regulation; such an assumption
intensifies the risk of damage from regulatory inadequacies.
The planning guidance states that cumulative impacts are unlikely to be a consideration at the explora-
tion stage regardless of how close well pads are. This is despite the National Planning Policy Framework
referring to the relevance of cumulative impacts in assessing whether a development is appropriate to its
location and in the public interest.54 This means that fracking impacts are segmented. Separating such
aspects imposes an artificial distinction and ignores the full implication of the potential for environmental
damage at the exploration stage, particularly when deficiencies in the regulation are ignored.
The planning guidance stresses the importance of mineral extraction for both local and national econo-
mies as a relevant planning consideration. However potential future activities and alternative energy devel-
opments in the area are not relevant.55 This emphasis on the economic value of shale gas is likely to be
challenged in the context of conservation during appropriate assessments. A project can only be authorised
in a protected habitat if the authority has made certain there will be no adverse effects on a protected site.
However, the question of how easily exemptions allowing development for imperative reasons of over-
riding public interest (IROPI) will be invoked on an economic basis remains.56 This tension will be of even
greater concern should clause 58 of the Draft Deregulation Bill come into force. This emphasises the need to
consider the desirability of promoting economic growth when exercising regulatory functions.57 Such eco-
nomic considerations raise questions as to how the EU requirement to avoid conflict between regulators'
`regulatory' functions and their function relating to economic development of resources is to be met.58
Economic implications also extend to English landowners. Whilst section 106 agreements between
operators and LAs can be used to impose planning obligations to cover the remediation of sites, the planning
guidance highlights the imposition on landowners of a duty to restore the site if the operator defaults.59 This
suggests that the area is open to legal uncertainty and that a lack of precedent could have extreme and
unforeseen consequences.
Although a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has now been conducted for the fourteenth
onshore licensing round (consultation ended on 28 March 2014),60 which compels a more holistic approach
to risks, this has been conducted under several problematic assumptions. Whilst recognising significant
negative effects and cumulative effects on population health, air quality, geology, soil, water and waste
at the local and community level from operations, these are assumed to be mitigated to an acceptable level

through planning controls and regulation.61 With mitigation emphasising the use of current regulations such
as the EIA and BAT, it is clear that even the SEA assessment is constrained by the assumption that the
current regulatory system is `robust'.
Being a new industry in England, the UK and the EU, building a shared resource and knowledge base
could prove of significant value.62 However, Member States have adopted radically different approaches
to fracking. Some (e.g. France) have a moratorium in place and others (e.g. the UK) have actively encour-
aged the technology. The development of shared best practices and accident prevention is likely to face sig-
nificant hurdles, meaning that any improvements based on EU industry experience will be neither
straightforward nor prompt.63
Although the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG) has issued best practice guidance
for shale gas operators, it remains voluntary. Relevant legislation and regulatory requirements are collated
in the guidance, as are references to other relevant oil and gas guidelines (e.g. the Well Integrity Guidelines)
and industry best practices from the conventional sector. Monitoring and transparency within the industry
are encouraged (including the public disclosure of fracturing fluids), but without enforceability mechanisms
and supporting legislation many guidance provisions still fail to guarantee adequate environmental and
health protection.64
At present, the uncertainty in relation to fracking controls extends beyond technical regulation and into
practical application and enforcement. Such a combination is problematic and highlights that the regulatory
system will not remove the current gaps and uncertainties unless the issue of authority experience, expertise
and resources is also addressed.
The need for regulatory change
With uncertainty as to application and potential for gaps in the controls, the question that must be addressed
is: what now for the regulation of shale gas and fracking? The objective of fracking regulation (leaving aside
questions of whether England should develop a new fossil fuel industry) is to ensure that the exploration for
shale gas can proceed in a manner which also protects the environment and public health. Under the current
regulatory system, the uncertainty and risk associated with fracking is not justifiable. The very way in which
the risks have been assessed assumes that a `robust' regulatory system will be in place; this has fed the justi-
fication for significant instances of regulatory inaction.65 Clearly the current regulation is not `robust', and the
framing of such risks as `low' based on this assumption highlights the deficiencies in this cyclic determination.
As this article has shown, there are a number of risks associated with fracking and a number of uncer-
tainties as to its impact in England. These correspond with evident gaps and uncertainties within the current
regulation and the current regulatory approach risks a non-uniform application of uncertain regulations.
Maintenance of the current approach is beneficial in that it requires minimal effort and expenditure, whilst
allowing the shale gas industry to develop. However, it risks allowing regulatory gaps to remain until prob-
lems materialise.

Fracking remains unpredictable in the English context. First, in relation to the natural environment
there are a number of unknowns in geological terms (e.g. pathways and receptors for pollution and envi-
ronmental damage). Second, there are unknowns relating to human behaviour and practices (e.g. the way
in which operators will act, particularly in light of the lack of English experience and understanding of
shale gas activities). Fracking must be recognised and regulated as a new and uncertain technology.
What next?
Guidance. There are some arguments in favour of the introduction of guidance on fracking both to avoid reg-
ulatory reform and to allow this new technology and industry to develop.66 This argument is not without
merit; however, the assertion that current provisions provide `proper environmental safeguards' and are
well understood by businesses is highly questionable.67 A vast number of regulations apply and misunder-
standings surrounding their application have already materialised.68 Whilst guidance on the applicability of
the current provisions would be useful, this does not resolve the problem of the gaps in the current regula-
tion. Once these have been addressed, the value of guidance will be significantly increased. At present, how-
ever, it is of limited value. This is exemplified by the current EU Recommendation, which encourages
useful processes such as baseline monitoring and public dissemination of information. However, in relation
to areas such as environmental impact assessment and chemical registration, the current EU guidance, even
if legally enforceable, still leaves regulatory gaps and uncertainties.
Alteration of current provisions. An alternative would be to conduct a piecemeal reform of current regulations.
Such action fails to address the fundamental problem that controls from one system are failing to translate to
another system and its technology. Altering the current controls would not address this issue and would sup-
port the misplaced idea that they are sufficient to control new technologies. Such a piecemeal reform poses
the potential for clashes in controls and a distinct lack of clarity meaning that, in practice, gaps in the
regulation would likely remain.
A moratorium. Another available option would be to impose a temporary moratorium on fracking. A mor-
atorium on shale gas extraction is not a new concept in England (as seen following the seismic events in
2011).69 Further use of a response that allows the materialisation of damage prior to regulatory action
should not be adopted.
However, a moratorium could be used to halt activities in England until further information on the risks
and uncertainties associated with fracking becomes available based on operational experience in other
countries. Nonetheless, information from other jurisdictions with different geological, social and regulatory
conditions may prove to be of limited value.
Precaution and regulatory reform. The remaining, preferred option, is the development of precautionary reg-
ulation for fracking. To develop this, a temporary moratorium must be imposed. This would address the

current deficiencies in the regulatory system by acknowledging the need for change and allowing time for
detailed consideration of how this can be achieved. As precaution is a complex and disputed term the precise
approach needed is something beyond the scope of this article. Further research is required.70
There are too many regulatory gaps and uncertainties in the current legislation relating to fracking. Under
such a system environmental and health risks are self-evident, but could be avoided by the imposition of a
temporary moratorium until these issues can be addressed. Despite recognition at EU level of the need and
value of precautionary measures, these have not been adopted.71 The need for English operational informa-
tion requires exploratory activity; this will inevitably be delayed by a temporary moratorium and the imple-
mentation of precautionary measures. This carries the risk of economic disadvantage and slower industry
development, as well as delaying any potential benefits from shale gas.72 However, there is a need to ensure
that during the exploration and development stage, current risks and uncertainties are not left open.73 A pre-
cautionary approach would not prevent future industry development and would allow for later review of the
regulation, and amendment if necessary, once uncertainty in the English context is reduced (through the
production of operational information without unnecessary risk to the environment and health).
Ensuring that strong precautionary regulation is in place would also permit regulators to develop relevant
experience and knowledge, whilst simultaneously protecting both the environment and public health. This
is crucial to ensuring that regulation is effectively applied in practice.
Current law does not transpose neatly onto the new technology and industry it is trying to control. This
article does not attempt to propose the technical contents of any regulatory changes and, whilst there may
not be an immediately obvious and effective way to do this, until attention is drawn to the issue of regulatory
inadequacy and it is given serious consideration a mismatch of regulatory uncertainty and gaps will
remain.74 Notably, the use of current industry best practice guidance could prove useful at this stage in help-
ing to design enforceable precautionary regulation.
These issues are not unique to fracking. Despite the problems with allowing new technologies such as
genetically modified organisms and nano-technology to proceed in a manner where regulation is constantly
catching up,75 fracking indicates that little has been learnt from the historically problematic relationship
between new technologies, the law and environmental and health protection.
Conclusion
Exploration for shale gas in England has sparked significant debate, yet little of this has focused in any detail
on the control afforded by current regulation. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with
fracking accompanied by a number of corresponding gaps and uncertainties in the regulation. Whilst the
present regulatory systems offers a base of controls built upon conventional oil and gas experience, its suit-
ability is limited. The inability to transpose one set of regulations from an existing context into a new con-
text is apparent. At present gaps emerge as a result of a lack of coherence and uncertainty surrounding the
applicability of regulations as well as through the application of inappropriate thresholds. These are com-
pounded by the lack of regulatory expertise and experience and the questionable capacity of regulatory

authorities to fulfil their assigned roles. Maintenance of the current approach and controls will leave areas
exposed to potential environmental and health damage.
At present, the framing of shale gas and fracking activities as low risk is based on the assumption that a
robust regulatory system is in place.76 This article has shown that this is not the case and that regulatory
change is needed. Such a change requires recognition of the fact that the current regulation does not fit the
technology and processes it is trying to control. Until this fact is acknowledged and addressed, the regula-
tion governing fracking will continue to be inadequate.
A number of options exist in relation to the reform of fracking regulation, including the piecemeal reform
of current provisions or the production of guidance. The difficulty with such reforms is that they fail to
acknowledge the problems raised by trying to map old regulations onto a new technology. The alternative
option ­ a temporary moratorium until further information on fracking in other jurisdictions is available ­ is
of limited value due to the context-specific generation of this information. At present, the state of the reg-
ulation suggests the need for a temporary moratorium which utilises the time to examine the current regu-
lation in detail and engages with the notion that gaps and uncertainties are apparent. This would ensure that
the regulatory gaps highlighted in this article are filled and that the operation of the new technology of frack-
ing in England is conducted under a precautionary regime enabling context-specific data to be generated.
This, in turn, would reduce uncertainty surrounding fracking and help to minimise damage to the environ-
ment and to public health.
