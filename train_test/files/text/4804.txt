Background Chronic hepatitis C is associated with significant morbidity and mor-
tality as a consequence of progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and
liver failure. Current treatment for chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon (IFN)
and ribavirin is associated with suboptimal responses and numerous adverse effects.
A number of botanical products have been used to treat hepatic disorders. Silyma-
rin, extracted from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum (L) Gaertn. (Asteraceae),
has been most widely used for various liver disorders, including chronic hepatitis C,
B, and alcoholic liver disease. However, the safety and efficacy of silymarin have not
been studied systematically in chronic hepatitis C.
Purpose We describe our strategy for a phased approach for studying the impact
of silymarin in hepatitis C, in the context of the unique challenges of botani-
cal product clinical trials and the development of specific and curative antiviral
therapy.
Methods This multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial
was conducted with four clinical centers and a data-coordinating center in the
United States, to assess the impact of silymarin therapy in patients with chronic
hepatitis C who failed conventional antiviral therapy.
Results Key aspects relevant to performing clinical trials of botanical products
include early identification of an appropriate product with standard product chem-
istry, acquisition of pharmacokinetic and dosing information, selection of the appro-
priate study group, and choosing rigorous outcome variables.
Potential limitations Trial participants were chronic hepatitis C patients who were
nonsustained virologic responders to IFN-based therapy; therefore, the findings are
not generalizable to all hepatitis C populations. Further, alanine aminotransferase,
a biochemical liver test, rather than hepatitis viral RNA or liver histology was the
primary end point.
Conclusions The challenges identified and addressed during development of this
United States multicenter Phase II trial to evaluate silymarin for treatment of patients
with chronic hepatitis C infection who had failed to respond successfully to previous
IFN-based therapy are common and must be addressed to conduct rigorous trials of
botanical products. Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 102

Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a heterogeneous
virus; it is estimated that 170 million people are
infected worldwide [1]. The prevalence of antibodies
to hepatitis C in the United States is approximately
1.6%, representing 4.1 million anti-HCV-positive
persons, according to the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey [1]. Chronic viral
hepatitis infection can lead to cirrhosis, hepatic
decompensation (i.e., liver failure), hepatocellular
carcinoma (i.e., liver cancer), and death. Further,
approximately 10,000 deaths result from hepatitis
C-associated complications annually. End-stage
liver disease due to chronic hepatitis C is the main
indication for liver transplantation [2]. Current esti-
mates suggest that there will be a continually
increasing disease burden, at least over the next
couple of decades, from hepatitis C and its compli-
cations [2].
While there have been some advances in the
treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection, thera-
peutic options remain limited. Over the past two
decades, treatment has evolved from standard
interferon (IFN) monotherapy to current standard
of care with pegylated IFN and ribavirin [3­5].
Apart from less than ideal response rates for most
HCV genotype 1 patients in the United States,
there is a more difficult issue of tolerance of ther-
apy. Both IFN and ribavirin have numerous side
effects that are frequently not well-tolerated by
patients; several studies estimate that up to 86% of
patients are deferred from conventional IFN treat-
ment due to medical or psychiatric comorbidities
[6­8]. Substantial numbers of patients with chronic
HCV in the United States therefore do not receive
available therapies or are nonresponders to current
treatment regimens, due at least in part to the ina-
bility to tolerate full therapy [3­5]. With the dearth
of treatment options for such a common and seri-
ous disease, it is not surprising that both clinicians
and patients have an interest in studying other
potential therapies for treatment-resistant chronic
HCV infection that may have a better side effect
profile.
Silymarin, extracted from the milk thistle plant,
Silybum marianum, is one of a variety of botanical
products that have been used to treat hepatic disor-
ders, including chronic hepatitis C, B, and alcoholic
liver disease [9­12]. Silymarin is primarily a mixture
of at least six major isomeric flavonolignans and a
few flavonoids and is touted for its antioxidant
properties [13]. Data from the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2007 indicate that
20% of the U.S. population uses botanical products
regularly, and that silymarin use constitutes nearly
5% of this product exposure [14].
Limitations of current silymarin data
Although largely in vitro evidence has accumulated
on silymarin and its putative antiviral, immu-
nomodulatory, and antifibrotic properties, clinical
studies have not suggested a clinical benefit for sily-
marin in HCV infection [9­11,15­21]. A review of
clinical studies of botanical products, including sily-
marin, that have been used for hepatic diseases
revealed a lack of consistency in botanical prepara-
tions, dosing, clinical outcome measures, and
length of treatment. There was no firm evidence
that botanical products conferred clinical benefit in
HCV infection [9­11].
As is common with clinical trials of all or most
botanical products, studies are limited by a lack of
standardization of the product to be tested and lack
of pharmacokinetic and dosing data. In addition,
the outcome measures may not be comparable with
those used in other studies. Furthermore, informa-
tion on duration of treatment and follow-up are
often lacking. For clinical trials of conventional
pharmaceuticals, extensive preliminary preclinical
and clinical studies (i.e., pharmacokinetics, dosing,
and mechanistic studies) are undertaken early in
product development, prior to studies testing effi-
cacy, due to regulatory requirements of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Such data,
however, typically are not required, or even availa-
ble, for most marketed botanical products, includ-
ing silymarin. Also, unlike conventional drugs,
botanicals are typically mixtures of uncharacterized
constituents; particular attention must be given to
analyzing all potentially active ingredients.
Therefore, it is essential to perform early-phase test-
ing of botanical products to provide such critical
information before embarking on large-scale clini-
cal trials.
Identifying the silymarin
manufacturer
Prior to issuing the request for applications (RFA)
for the clinical trials of silymarin in 2005 (Figure 1),
the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), via the
National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine (NCCAM), issued a Notice of Opportunity
for Clinical Trial Collaboration to identify manu-
facturers of silymarin that would be interested in
donating product and placebo for proposed future
trials. The early identification of a manufacturer
was essential in developing a clinical trial for this
botanical product. Unlike conventional pharma-
ceuticals, there is considerable variability in com-
position and chemistry of marketed botanical
products. Therefore, it was necessary to identify a
104  KR Reddy et al.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 102­112 http://ctj.sagepub.com
manufacturer that could provide appropriate prod-
uct information. Moreover, as dietary supplements
are marketed in the United States without require-
ments for standard chemistry, manufacturing and
controls, or providing preclinical data to the FDA,
the manufacturer selected was expected to be will-
ing to work with both NIH and FDA to provide
such information for silymarin.
Silymarin manufacturers who responded to the
Notice of Opportunity were requested to provide
NIH/NCCAM information regarding their silyma-
rin product as it was anticipated that a trial of sily-
marin for a chronic liver disease would require
approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND)
application from the FDA; thus, product specifica-
tions would have to comply with standard FDA
requirements. NIH/NCCAM selected the manufac-
turer based on several components of the product
information, including product chemistry, manu-
facturing and controls, preclinical data, clinical
data, information on regulatory filings, and the
ability to provide support for phased clinical trials.
Following review of responses from the manufac-
turers, the Legalon® 140 brand of silymarin mar-
keted by Rottapharm|Madaus (Monza, Italy and
Cologne, Germany) was selected for the silymarin
trials.
Study organization
After identifying the silymarin manufacturer, NIH/
NCCAM issued an RFA in 2005 for Phase I/II trials of
silymarin for chronic liver disease (Figure 1) in order
to assemble a consortium (the Silymarin in Non-
alcoholic Steatohepatitis and C Hepatitis (SyNCH)
Study Group, Appendix). The National Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
(NIDDK) also participated in the project. This Phase
II multicenter trial was conducted with four clinical
centers and a data-coordinating center (DCC) in the
United States. The steering committee for the con-
sortium comprises the principal investigators from
the clinical centers, one of whom is the steering
committee chair, and the DCC and two NIH project
scientists (NIH/NCCAM and NIH/NIDDK). The
steering committee members designed and imple-
mented the clinical trials of this consortium. A Data
and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was estab-
lished by NIH/NCCAM to provide trial oversight.
Investigational product
Legalon® 140 is a milk thistle fruit extract (Silybum
marianum (L) Gaertn. (Asteraceae)) standardized to
140
mg of silymarin per gelatin capsule (53% as
total silibinin, quantified photometrically). A
Legalon® 140 capsule contains 180
mg of dried
extract of milk thistle fruits, or 140mg of silymarin,
which is the presumed active ingredient, or 108mg
of silymarin quantified as silibinin by high-pressure
liquid chromatography. The total weight of the cap-
sule is 429mg and includes other milk thistle com-
ponents of the extraction process, excipients, and
the capsule shell. The 108mg of silymarin in Legalon®
capsules consists of the following potentially active
ingredients: silibinins A + B (~50
mg), silicristin
(~20mg), silidianin (~15mg), and isosilibinins A + B
(~15
mg). The placebo gelatin capsules used in the
trial were identically sized capsules filled with a
powder containing lactose and other components
of Legalon® 140, including mannitol, magnesium
stearate, and sodium carboxymethyl starch. The
phased trials in this program were conducted under
an IND, held by NIH/NCCAM, from the FDA.

Phase I study and selection of
doses for Phase II
In view of suggestive in vitro evidence, a phased-
study approach was developed by the SyNCH Study
Group (Figure 1) to study the potential role of sily-
marin in research participants with chronic hepatitis
C who were previously refractory to conventional
therapy. Since preliminary dosing and pharmacoki-
netic data on the product were not available, a Phase
I dose-ranging study in research participants with
chronic HCV was performed initially by the study
team [22]. The research participants were randomized
to one of four silymarin doses covering a fivefold
range (140, 280, 560 and 700
mg, thrice daily), to
assess safety and dose­exposure relationships in HCV
patients who were previously treatment nonrespond-
ers. No drug-related adverse events were reported
during the Phase I study, and daily oral doses of up to
2.1
g were well tolerated. Nonlinear pharmacokinet-
ics of silibinins A and B were noted, with data sug-
gesting that the otherwise low bioavailability of
silymarin may be overcome at higher than usual
doses (700
mg thrice daily). Since no adverse events
were observed at the highest exposures obtained
with a dose of 700mg, this dose was identified as the
high dose for Phase II trial, as it was expected to pro-
vide reliable exposures and to be safe and well toler-
ated in the HCV population. In addition, the dose
burden of five pills three times daily was considered
the largest at which acceptable patient compliance
can be expected. As dose­exposure proportionality
was observed over the dose range of 140­700
mg of
silymarin, a dose of 420mg was selected for the lower
dose in the Phase II trial, as it would be expected to
result in 40% lower exposure than the 700-mg dose,
which might be associated with clinically significant
differences in pharmacodynamic end points.
The Phase II study, the subject of this report, was
a placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized
trial that focused on safety and efficacy of silymarin
at two distinct doses (420 and 700mg, thrice daily)
for treating patients with chronic HCV infection
who had previously failed to respond successfully to
IFN-based therapy. This report describes the ration-
ale for the design of a Phase II trial of a botanical
product in treating previous nonresponders, the
challenges encountered in study design and imple-
mentation, and presents baseline characteristics of
the enrolled cohort.
Methods
Selection of trial participants
This clinical trial studying silymarin treatment in
chronic hepatitis C included treatment-resistant
patients. Several studies estimated that up to 86% of
patients are deferred from conventional IFN treat-
ment due to medical or psychiatric comorbidities
[6­8]. Adverse events are common in patients with
chronic hepatitis C treated with combination of
pegylated IFN and ribavirin [23]. The impressive
therapeutic response rates from Phase III clinical tri-
als of pegylated IFN and ribavirin reflect a highly
select patient population, that is, those who are
deemed to be ideal treatment candidates and who
have no comorbidities that would hamper their
ability to tolerate a rigorous therapy. The remainder
of patients with chronic hepatitis C, those with
absolute or relative contraindications and those
who did not achieve sustained virological response
with previous therapy, could potentially benefit
from other therapies.
Thus, as conventional treatment options existed
for chronic hepatitis C when this trial began and
currently, this study focused on the subset who had
failed to have a sustained virological response to
previous IFN-based therapy (treatment resistant),
then the standard of care, rather than treatment-
naïve patients. Lack of a sustained virological
response was defined as detectable virus less than 6
months following end of treatment:
1. HCV RNA remained detectable throughout
the therapy (nonresponders).
2. HCV RNA dropped to below detectable levels
during treatment but became detectable
while still on therapy (breakthrough).
3. HCV RNA dropped to below detectable levels
during treatment but became detectable once
therapy was discontinued (relapsers).
After they completed screening (see Table 1), 154
patients with chronic hepatitis who did not have a
sustained virological response to previous IFN-based
antiviral therapy, with or without ribavirin, were
allocated, using an adaptive minimization randomi-
zation scheme, to one of three treatment arms:
420mg of silymarin (three Legalon® capsules + two
placebo capsules), 700mg of silymarin (five Legalon®
capsules), or placebo (five placebo capsules). Thus,
five capsules of study treatment were taken orally
thrice daily for 24 weeks. At screening, eligible
patients were instructed to avoid the use of milk
thistle products, and most were randomized within
28 days.
Patients with any of the HCV genotypes were eli-
gible, provided they met the treatment-resistant
definition. Study visits were planned as outlined in
Figure 2; they were planned to provide the opportu-
nity to perform population-based pharmacokinetic
studies. In addition, the multiple study visits and
trial infrastructure provided the opportunity to
106  KR Reddy et al.
Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 102­112 http://ctj.sagepub.com

collect serum samples from a well-characterized
cohort that can be assayed for mechanistic studies,
including exploring immunologic effects of chronic
silymarin exposure and biomarker screening.
An exemption subcommittee of the overall steer-
ing committee, comprising two hepatologists from
the NIH/NIDDK who did not enroll participants,
adjudicated whether participants who did not meet
all inclusion, or who met at least one exclusion, cri-
terion could be enrolled in the trial. During accrual,
25 exemptions were requested and 24 were
approved. None of the exemptions were related to
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was the basis
of the primary efficacy end point of the trial.
Phase II trial objectives and
outcome variables
The primary objectives of the Phase II trial are to
assess the safety profile of silymarin versus placebo
across three exposure levels (0, 420, and 700 mg)
and to evaluate whether a 24-week course of silyma-
rin has a discernible impact on ALT, a biochemical
marker of hepatic disease. The primary outcome
variable for efficacy is serum ALT level of 45
IU/L
(approximate maximum of normal range) or less, or
a decrease in ALT from baseline level by at least 50%
to less than 65
IU/L (approximately 1.5 times the
upper limit of normal) at the end of the 24-week
treatment period. The primary outcome variable for
safety is the occurrence of a dose-limiting toxicity
during the 24-week treatment period.
Secondary objectives of the trial include assessing
changes in serum levels of HCV RNA during silyma-
rin therapy, characterizing the population pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of silymarin
isomers, including silibinins A and B, isosilibinins A
and B, silicristin, and silidianin, following adminis-
tration of silymarin to participants with HCV, and
exploring relationships between silymarin therapy
and clinical markers of HCV hepatic disease activ-
ity. The relationship between dose and change in
log10
(ALT) will also be assessed.
Choice of primary outcome
variable
Perhaps the most direct measure of improvement in
liver disease is obtained by assessing the grade of
necroinflammatory activity and stage of fibrosis in

paired liver biopsies obtained before and after

therapy [24]. Indeed, most therapeutic trials of liver
disease have focused on liver biopsy end points.
However, liver biopsies confer some risks and dis-
comfort to the patient and are costly to perform.
More importantly, it is possible that significant
changes in hepatic histology cannot be discerned in
trials conducted for relatively short treatment peri-
ods (i.e., weeks to months). These factors, as well as
the inherent variability of liver biopsy sampling and
its histologic scoring, compelled the investigators to
develop a nonbiopsy primary outcome variable for
this Phase II trial.
Therefore, when designing this trial for resistant
disease, the approach focused on a clinically
important end point (changes in ALT level), which
did not require a liver biopsy. Precedence for such
this choice of outcome was available from earlier
trials of antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C,
prior to the advent of qualitative assays for HCV
RNA, which utilized biochemical response (changes
in hepatic enzyme activity) as the primary end
point [25­29]. Histologic improvement, however,
frequently accompanied biochemical improve-
ment in these studies during IFN therapy, even
when sustained virological response was not
observed. Many hepatologists consider that serum
ALT activity may provide an indirect marker for
improvement in disease activity, although this
supposition has not been demonstrated conclu-
sively [3,4,29­31].
Thus, the primary outcome assessment for this
24-week Phase II study of silymarin focuses on
quantifying changes in ALT levels to explore initial
evidence for efficacy of silymarin in treatment-
resistant chronic HCV infection. The primary end
point of the trial incorporates stringent criteria for
changes in ALT levels. In order to detect such
marked changes in ALT, the enrollment criteria also
required a high threshold for inclusion (at least
65
IU/L). It is likely that therapeutic agents that
could improve surrogate biochemical markers of
disease activity and, perhaps, ameliorate complica-
tions of hepatic disease even without affecting HCV
RNA, would be an attractive adjunct to currently
available medications.

Rationale for revising eligibility
criteria to include patients with
well-compensated cirrhosis
At initial study implementation, trial eligibility was
restricted to patients without cirrhosis noted on any
previous liver biopsy. Subsequently, the protocol
was amended to permit enrollment of patients with
well-compensated cirrhosis. This protocol change
resulted primarily from two considerations. The
first consideration was that a significant proportion
of patients with chronic HCV have cirrhosis but
were excluded from the trial. During the trial plan-
ning phase, there was considerable interest in
including patients with well-compensated cirrhosis
as they are a significant subgroup of those with
chronic disease. But due to insufficient product
safety data in the patient population, they were
excluded. Another consideration was the lower
than anticipated enrollment rate across all sites dur-
ing the trial enrollment phase, in part due to exclud-
ing a significant fraction of patients with chronic
HCV infection and cirrhosis, a factor associated
with nonresponse to IFN-based therapies.
The Phase I trial had provided safety data across
many dose levels among HCV patients without doc-
umented cirrhosis. After the Phase II trial was initi-
ated, however, pharmacokinetic and safety data
from a newly published study suggested that cir-
rhotic patients could be treated safely with an intra-
venous form of silibinin (Legalon® SIL). It was noted
that circulating levels associated with the intrave-
nous form of the product were considerably higher
than those associated with orally administered sily-
marin [12]. In that study, higher serum levels of sili-
binins A and B were achieved during daily
intravenous infusions for a 2-week period with no
dose-related adverse effects; patients with cirrhosis
who had failed prior therapy were an important
subgroup of study participants [12].
However, the safety profile observed in patients
with cirrhosis with the intravenous form of silibinin
(Legalon® SIL) may not be identical to silymarin since
they are chemically two different drugs. Silymarin is
composed of six flavonolignans including silibinins
A and B, whereas Legalon® SIL is composed of water-
soluble hemisuccinate covalent esters of only silib-
inins A and B. Therefore, once the protocol was
modified to include those with well-compensated
cirrhosis, after approval from the DSMB and relevant
institutional review boards (IRBs), the study adopted
a more stringent plan to monitor safety in trial

participants with well-compensated cirrhosis. This
plan included monitoring plasma concentrations in
the event of a serious adverse event or hepatic bio-
chemical test elevation in someone with cirrhosis,
since the only oral silymarin pharmacokinetic data
published to date indicated that blood levels were
likely to be substantially higher in cirrhotics than in
noncirrhotics [32].
Sample size considerations
The sample size for this study was estimated based
on the primary comparison of the proportions of
participants in each arm who attain the primary
end point, as defined earlier. The total sample size
of 153 was calculated to provide 80% power to
detect a clinically meaningful difference in outcome
between the placebo and silymarin arms if there
was no dose­response relationship, and over 90% if
there was a dose­response relationship. This sample
size calculation assumed a spontaneous ALT nor-
malization (primary end point) in 15% of placebo-
treated participants and assumed a clinically
significant (25%) improvement in the success rate
for the silymarin-treated group. A total of 154 par-
ticipants were enrolled.
Baseline characteristics of
participants in the Phase II trial
The baseline characteristics of the participants
enrolled in the Phase II trial (summarized in Table 2)
are representative of the population of nonrespond-
ers to current hepatitis C therapy of pegylated IFN
and ribavirin [33]. The median age of the predomi-
nantly male (71.4%) participants was 54 years. As
anticipated, many of these previous IFN-based ther-
apy nonresponders had characteristics of difficult-
to-successfully-treat patients including genotype 1
infection (91.4%), cirrhosis (27.9%), overweight or
obese (85.0%), and elevated fasting blood glucose of
at least 100
mg/dL (36.6%) [34] (Table 2). The final
cohort is composed of 20% African-American par-
ticipants, similar to the percentage enrolled in non-
responder trials but higher than the percentage
enrolled in clinical trials involving treatment-naïve
patients [3­5]. Nearly 90% of the cohort reported
regular use of medications (prescription or over-the-
counter preparations) at study enrollment, with
almost 30% reporting taking one or more alterna-
tive or complementary medications. Dietary supple-
ments reported by 28% of trial participants at
enrollment included a variety of products such as
nutrients and botanicals.
Discussion
Despite a large body of literature describing the use
of silymarin over several decades, the published

evidence of clinical efficacy in hepatic disease is
Silymarin in chronic hepatitis C 109
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 102­112
equivocal. Thus, it was important to systematically
study the potential benefit of silymarin in a com-
mon chronic liver disease. The large disease burden,
with lack of effective therapies, along with frequent
poor tolerability of IFN and ribavirin therapy by
chronic hepatitis C patients made them an impor-
tant group of patients in which to evaluate silyma-
rin. The previous lack of consistency across the few
studies with regard to efficacy end points, silymarin
preparations, and liver disease diagnosis was further
impetus to implement a phased development plan
for clinical testing. During the early planning stages,
it was apparent that, as for most botanical products,
dose-finding pharmacokinetic studies were sparse
and doses of different preparations had been identi-
fied arbitrarily for assessment in liver diseases. In
addition, there were no preexisting studies of botan-
ical-food or botanical-drug pharmacokinetics. It
was also important to identify an industry collabo-
rator motivated to participate in the development
plan, which would provide study product of stand-
ard composition and which also could provide a
product that complied with FDA IND requirements
for clinical testing. Implementing a phased
approach, the investigators initially performed a
dose-ranging Phase I study to assess pharmacokinet-
ics and safety, after which two doses of 420 and
700
mg taken three times a day were targeted for
evaluation in the Phase II study.
The cohort reflects the treatment-resistant HCV
population in the United States in many ways, as it
is predominantly male, with a number of clinical
parameters associated with resistant disease, includ-
ing genotype 1, obesity, diabetes, and cirrhosis [3­5,
34,35]. Several reports have suggested that African-
Americans do not respond well to hepatitis C ther-
apy [36]. Thus, it was anticipated that the cohort
would consist of substantial numbers of African-
Americans. Although 20% of the cohort is African-
American, it is lower than might be expected in a
cohort of treatment-resistant HCV patients. This is
likely due to several factors, including the typically
lower ALT levels observed in African-American
patients, compared with Caucasian with chronic
HCV, and the stringent inclusion threshold of at
least 65
IU/L for the current trial [37]. In addition,
data regarding botanical product use from the 2007
NHIS CAM survey indicate much greater use for
such products in Caucasians (43%) than African-
Americans (26%), suggesting that Caucasians might
have greater interest in enrolling in studies of
botanical therapies [14].
While IFN and ribavirin are known to cause sig-
nificant side effects, silymarin has been well tolerated
by patients with chronic hepatitis C [9­12]. As fre-
quently noted among patients with serious chronic
illnesses, quality of life is significantly diminished in
patients with chronic hepatitis C. This aspect of the

disease is associated with considerable work absence
due to functional disability [38]. Given the side
effects of conventional HCV therapy, many patients
are reluctant to adhere to standard treatment regi-
mens. Many patients explore other potential thera-
pies, such as silymarin, to complement conventional
therapies, or less frequently, as an alternative to con-
ventional therapies. In view of the fairly widespread
use of silymarin, the current phased investigation of
its use in chronic hepatitis C will provide a rigorous
assessment of its safety and associated quality of life,
as well as further pharmacokinetic data on silymarin
in patients with hepatic disease.
Summary
The phased-study approach undertaken for silyma-
rin as described in this report addressed several
unique challenges to design of clinical trials pro-
grams of botanical products. As products may be
marketed in the United States without standard
chemistry data provided and usually with limited
data on pharmacokinetics and dosing, much early-
phase testing is required before clinical trials can be
designed and implemented. Unlike studies of con-
ventional pharmaceuticals, early work to identify a
manufacturer and a standard botanical formulation
must be undertaken to begin the process of prelimi-
nary preclinical assessment. Verifying the accepta-
bility of testing for IND filings with the FDA is an
important early step in planning clinical testing of
all new products for specific disease indications but
are particularly challenging for botanical products
due to lack of data, manufacturing requirements,
and standard product composition. The phased-
study approach implemented by the SyNCH Study
Group for silymarin has required several years of
effort but has been successful in providing impor-
tant chemistry, pharmacokinetic, and dosing data
on a commonly used botanical product. Enrollment
in the trial began in May 2008 and concluded in
May 2010. The treatment and follow-up phases of
the trial were completed by March 2011.
