Introduction
Sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea)
have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascu-
lar and cerebrovascular diseases and metabolic disorders.1
In addition, patients experiencing sleep problems report
lower self-perceived physical health,2 and impaired qual-
ity of life (QoL).3 Hence, in their recent scientific state-
ment the American Heart Association called for more

Abstract
Background: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in patients with cardiac diseases and associated with poor health
outcomes. However, little is known about sleep disturbance in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Aims: We examined the prevalence and predictors of sleep disturbance and the impact on perceived health status in a
Dutch cohort of implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients.
Methods: Patients (n=195) enrolled in the Web-based distress program for implantable cardioverter defibrillator
patients (WEBCARE) trial completed questionnaires at the time of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation,
three, six and 12 months afterwards. Sleep disturbance was assessed with the corresponding item #3 of the Patient
Health Questionnaire 9.
Results: At baseline, 67% (n=130) reported sleep disturbance (cut off 1). One year later, the prevalence was 57%
(n=112). Younger age (odds ratio=0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.92­0.99; p=0.012) and high negative affectivity/low
social inhibition (odds ratio=4.47, 95% confidence interval 1.52­13.17; p=0.007) were associated with sleep disturbance
at 12 months in adjusted analyses. Sleep disturbance was not associated with health status at 12 months. Charlson
Comorbidity Index, anxiety, Type D personality and high negative affectivity/low social inhibition were associated with
impaired health status at follow-up.
Conclusions: Sleep disturbance was highly prevalent in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Younger
age and high negative affectivity predicted sleep disturbance 12 months post-implantation independent of other
demographic, clinical, intervention and psychological covariates. Sleep disturbance was not associated with impaired
health status at the 12-month follow-up.

research and implementation of evidence-based sleep rec-
ommendations by healthcare organizations.1
The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a
device that monitors the heart rhythm and in the event of a
potentially life threatening arrhythmia intervenes with car-
dioversion and an electric shock of up to 840 volts.4
Despite the unequivocal medical benefits of the ICD,4 a
subgroup of ICD patients is at risk of experiencing adjust-
ment problems post-implantation that include anxiety,
depression and even posttraumatic stress.5,6 In turn, this
may lead to impaired QoL, adverse cardiovascular out-
comes and perhaps sleep disturbances.7­9 Particularly,
patients with a Type D (distressed) personality (combina-
tion of high negative affectivity and high social inhibition)
are prone to experience adverse health outcomes
post-implantation.10,11
To date, only a few studies have focused on sleep dis-
turbances in patients with an ICD. A Danish study found
clinically significant sleep problems in up to 67% of
patients.12 One American study found that patients with
ICD and co-morbid sleep problems reported increased
fatigue, decreased mood and poorer device acceptance,8
while a small study using actigraphy that measures sleep
efficiency by means of sleep/wake cycles found that ICD
patients had better sleep efficiency than cardiac patients
without an ICD.13 This is somewhat in line with a recent
meta-analysis revealing that sleep disordered breathing is
associated with an increased incidence of appropriate ICD
therapy only in patients with heart failure and reduced
ejection fraction.14 This might indicate that the underlying
disease (e.g. heart failure) is of importance when assessing
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and sleep disturbances
in ICD patients.15
TheAmerican HeartAssociation has advocated the assess-
ment of cardiovascular health by using PROs, which repre-
sent patients' subjective evaluation of their functioning.16
Given the association of sleep disturbances and cardiac
and metabolic diseases,1,14 it is of utmost importance to
examine which patients are at risk of experiencing self-
reported sleep disturbance and whether this affects their
perceived health status. The objective of the current study
was therefore (a) to examine the prevalence of sleep dis-
turbance in an ICD population followed over a 12-month
period; (b) to longitudinally relate demographic, clinical
and psychological variables (i.e. depression, anxiety, Type
D personality) to sleep disturbance; and (c) examine
whether sleep disturbance has a negative effect on per-
ceived health status, using a prospective study design.
Methods
Study design
Data from the Web-based distress program for patients
withanimplantablecardioverterdefibrillator(WEBCARE)
trial was used in the current study. The study was regis-
tered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00895700). A
detailed description of the WEBCARE trial has been pub-
lished elsewhere.17 In brief, WEBCARE examined the
effectiveness of a Web-based intervention based on the
principles of cognitive behavioural therapy that targeted
symptoms of anxiety and depression in a randomised con-
trolled trial design. No statistically significant differences
were found between the intervention versus usual care
group on the pre-specified primary and secondary
endpoints.18
Participants
Patients implanted with a first-time ICD between April
2010­February 2013 in one of six medical centres in the
Netherlands (Amphia Hospital, Breda; Canisius-
Wilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen; Catharina Hospital,
Eindhoven; Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam; Onze
Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis Hospital, Amsterdam; Vlietland
Hospital, Schiedam) comprised the study population.
Participants were eligible for inclusion if it was their first-
time ICD and they were between 18­75 years of age.
Exclusion criteria were other life-threatening comorbidi-
ties (e.g. cancer), significant cognitive impairments (e.g.
dementia), history of psychiatric illness other than affec-
tive or anxiety disorders, life expectancy less than one
year, and being on the waiting list for a heart transplant.
Participants lacking Internet or computer skills and partici-
pants with insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language
were also excluded.
Procedure
The ICD nurse or technician approached patients about
study participation in the hospital, prior to, or shortly after,
the ICD implantation.All patients were informed about the
study both orally and in writing. Patients who met all of
the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and
provided written informed consent were included in the
study. Patients completed a set of standardised and vali-
dated questionnaires at baseline (prior to leaving the hos-
pital) and at three-, six- and 12 months post-implantation,
and these were sent to their home address together with a
pre-addressed stamped envelope. Patients received up to
three reminder phone calls if the questionnaires were not
returned within two weeks. The study protocol was
approved by the medical ethics committees of the partici-
pating hospitals. The study was performed in accordance
to the Declaration of Helsinki principals.
Measures
Demographic and clinical variables.Information on demo-
graphic (age, gender, marital status, education level, body
392 European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 17(5)
mass index) and clinical variables (ICD indication ­
primary: patients at risk of experiencing sudden cardiac
arrest vs secondary: patients who have previously experi-
enced a sudden cardiac arrest-, heart failure, New York
Heart Association Functional Class, left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction, QRS-width, heart rate, diabetes, comorbidi-
ties, psychotropic and cardiac drugs) were captured from
the patients' medical records or by self-report.
Sleep disturbance.Sleep disturbance was assessed with
item #3 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9):
`Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much'.19
This item is evaluated on a four-point Likert scale ranging
from zero (not at all) to three (nearly every day) and indi-
cates sleep problems in the last two weeks. Previous
research has shown that a cut off of 1 on the PHQ item #3
provides the best balance between sensitivity (82.5%) and
specificity (84.5%) and that it can be used as a valid indi-
cation of sleep disturbance.20
Psychological variables
Anxiety.Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the
seven-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).21
Items of the GAD-7 are answered on a four-point Likert
scale ranging from zero (not at all) to three (almost every
day), with the total score ranging from 0­21. Higher scores
indicate higher levels of anxiety. The GAD-7 has an excel-
lent internal consistency with a Cronbach's  of 0.92 and
good test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation of
r=0.83.21
Depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were assessed
with the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2),
as these two items represent the core symptoms of depres-
sion.19 This was done in order to prevent overlap with the
predictor variable (i.e. sleep) and outcome variable (i.e.
depressive symptoms) in the analyses. The two items rep-
resent the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia
over the past two weeks and are answered on a four-point
Likert scale ranging from zero (not at all) to three (nearly
every day), with a score which can range from 0­6.22 The
PHQ-2 has a good validity and internal consistency with a
Cronbach's  of 0.83.22
Type D personality.Type D (distressed) personality was
assessed with the 14-item Type D Scale-14 (DS14).23
Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from
zero (false) to four (true). The 14 items can be divided into
two seven-item subscales, negative affectivity (NA; 0­28)
and social inhibition (SI; 0­28). A cut-off score of 10 on
both the NA and SI subscales is used to classify Type D
personality. Both subscales show a high level of internal
consistency with a Cronbach's  of 0.88 for the NA sub-
scale and 0.86 for the SI subscale and a high level of struc-
tural validity with test-retest correlations of r=0.72 for the
NA subscale and an intraclass correlation of r=0.82 for the
SI subscale.23
Health status.Perceived health status was assessed
with the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12).
This survey is a shorter version of the 36-item Short-
Form Health Survey (SF-36) and is a good alternative to
the SF-36 because of the high degree of correspondence
between both measures (r=0.94­0.97).24 The 12 items
can be divided into two subscales, the Physical and the
Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS, respec-
tively) scores. The scores range from 0­100 with a higher
score indicating better perceived health status. The test-
retest reliability is 0.89 and 0.76 for the PCS and MCS,
respectively.24
Statistical analyses
To compare patients with sleep disturbance to those with-
out on baseline variables, Chi-square tests were performed
to compare discrete variables and Student's t-tests were
used to compare continuous variables. Univariate and mul-
tivariate (hierarchical) logistic regression analyses were
used to identify the predictors of sleep disturbance at one
year after implantation and to identify predictors of health
status. Patients were classified as having a disturbed sleep
if they had a 1 score on #3 item of the PHQ-9 (0=no sleep
problems; 1=sleep problems). In multivariable analyses,
we adjusted for age, gender, ICD indication, Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI), use of psychotropic medication,
depression and anxiety, and Type D personality. These
variables were selected based on literature.25­28 To assess
the effects of Type D personality (high NA/high SI) on
health status, three dummy variables were created: high
NA/low SI, low NA/high SI, and low NA/low SI. Low
NA/low SI served as the reference category. In the second-
ary analysis, (a) CCI and (b) psychotropic medication vari-
able were replaced by heart failure (yes/no). If the
questionnaire was missing 20%, the missing data were
imputed using the mean score of the patient on the availa-
ble completed items. For DS14, GAD-7, PHQ-2 and
Health Status, two, three, two and six patients needed
imputation respectively. All statistical tests were two-
tailed, and p<0.05 was used to indicate statistical signifi-
cance. IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 was used for all
statistical analyses.
Results
Sample characteristics
A total of 195 patients were included in the current analy-
sis (Figure 1). Patients who did not return the baseline
questionnaires (n=51) or were excluded from current anal-
yses (n=94) were younger (M=57.12 vs 59.94; p=0.014)
Habibovi et al. 393
and more likely to use psychotropic drugs (24 vs 15
patients; p=0.011) compared to included patients. No
other statistically significant differences were found
between included and excluded patients on baseline demo-
graphic, clinical and psychological characteristics.
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of the total sample was 59.9 years (standard
deviation (SD)=10.00) and 82% of the participants were
men. Patient baseline characteristics for the total sample
and stratified by self-reported sleep disturbance are shown
in Table 1. At baseline, 130 (67%) patients reported having
a disturbed sleep at least several days per week. Patients
with a disturbed sleep at baseline were more likely to have
heart failure, symptoms of anxiety and depression and a
Type D personality (Table 1). No other significant differ-
ences were found on demographic or clinical variables
between patients with versus without reported sleep
disturbance.
Predictors of sleep disturbance
Figure 2 provides the prevalence of sleep disturbance at
baseline and at three-, six- and 12-month follow-up.
Univariate logistic regression analyses showed that age
(odds ratio (OR)=0.96; confidence interval (CI): 0.93­
0.99; p=0.005), anxiety symptoms (OR=1.11; CI:
1.03­1.19; p=0.007), Type D personality (OR=2.99; CI:
1.24­7.23; p=0.015) and high NA/low SI (OR=4.38; CI:
1.72­11.16; p=0.002) were significant predictors of dis-
turbed sleep 12 months after ICD implantation. None of
the other baseline demographic or clinical variables were
associated with sleep disturbance at the 12-month follow-
up (results not shown).
Results of the multivariable analyses are presented in
Table 2. Current findings show that younger age (OR=0.96;
CI: 0.92­0.99; p=0.013) and high NA/low SI (OR=4.47;
CI: 1.52­13.7; p=0.007) were independent predictors of
disturbed sleep one year after implantation after adjusting
for demographic, clinical, and psychological variables.
Secondary analysis showed that replacing CCI or psycho-
tropic drugs by heart failure in the model did not change
the results. In the current sample, heart failure was not
associated with disturbed sleep at 12 months (results not
shown).
Sleep disturbance and health status
After controlling for demographic (age, gender) and clini-
cal (ICD indication, CCI, use of psychotropic medication)
variables, sleep disturbance was a significant predictor of
impaired physical and mental health status (Table 3).
However, after adding the psychological variables (anxi-
ety, depression, Type D personality, high NA/low SI) to
the model, the effect of disturbed sleep on health status
disappeared.
CCI (PCS: =-0.220; p=0.002), anxiety (MCS:
=-0.270; p=0.001), and Type D personality (MCS:
=-0.169; p=0.018) were independent predictors of health
status at 12 months post-ICD implantation. NA was the
only significant predictor of both PCS and MCS, indicat-
ing that patients who with higher levels of NA at baseline,
generally reported lower physical (=-0.259; p=0.001) as
well as mental (=-0.276; p0.001) health status at the
12-month follow-up, after adjusting for demographic, clin-
ical and other psychological variables. When heart failure
was added to the model instead of psychotropic drugs, the
results did not change significantly (not shown).
Discussion
Current findings demonstrated that sleep disturbance is
highly prevalent among patients with an ICD at the time of
ICD implantation. Although sleep disturbance tended to
abate somewhat over time, a significant number of patients
still experienced disturbed sleep post-implantation.
Multivariable analyses showed that, after adjusting for rel-
evant demographic, clinical and psychological variables,
younger age and high NA/low SI were independent predic-
tors of sleep disturbances 12 months post-implantation.
Patients with high NA/low SI scores had a 4.5-fold increased
risk of having disturbed sleep at one-year follow-up. Sleep

disturbance was predictive of impaired health status at the
12-month follow-up after adjusting for demographic and
clinical variables. However, after adjusting for psychologi-
cal variables, they were no longer associated with health
status. In the final multivariable model, comorbidities were
associated with impaired physical health status, while anxi-
ety and Type D personality were associated with impaired
mental health status. The combination of high NA/low SI
was the only independent predictor of impairments in both
mental and physical health status.
Current finding with respect to prevalence rates are
comparable with a previous study reporting prevalence
rates of up to 67% at baseline and 57% at the six-month
follow-up within the ICD population.12 Our findings
extend current knowledge by providing prevalence rates
over a prolonged period of 12 months post-ICD-implanta-
tion. These findings indicate that sleep disturbance is not
merely caused by concerns associated with ICD implanta-
tion itself or other short-term adjustment issues. Moreover,
as they remain relatively stable over time, this might sug-
gest that there is an underlying, stable construct that
accounts for these prevalences (e.g. psychological or med-
ical profile). Hence, interventions that target sleep distur-
bances in this population should perhaps target more stable
constructs that are associated with poor long-term
adjustment.
With respect to predictors of sleep disturbances/lower
sleep quality, others have shown that younger age, female
gender, anxiety, depressive symptoms and underlying car-
diac disease predict lower sleep quality over time.1,12­14
Current findings are mostly in contrast to previous findings
with the only similarity being that younger patients are
identified as having a higher risk of experiencing disturbed
sleep. No evidence was found that gender, anxiety, depres-
sion and underlying cardiac disease (heart failure) were
associated with disturbed sleep. This difference could be
attributed to the fact that the previous studies focused more
on sleep quality as compared to sleep disturbances which
were the focus of the current study. In addition, previous
studies did not control for Type D personality or high NA/
low SI. The relationship between psychological distress
and sleep disturbances/quality could possibly be explained
by the presence of a more stable construct such as NA.
A relationship between NA and impaired sleep has been
demonstrated several times in previous research.29­31 The

tendency to experience negative emotions across time and
situations is associated with feelings of dysphoria, anxiety
and a negative view of self.23,31 This is partly also in line
with the current findings, as high NA/low SI was an inde-
pendent predictor of impaired health status. A possible
explanation for the relation with sleep disturbance is that
NA amplifies a person's reaction to, and perception of,
stressful events. These individuals are likely to experience
high levels of stress, tend to worry and often feel unhappy
and irritated,23 which may result in impaired sleep quality/
sleep disturbances. In addition, impaired sleep quality may
increase the patient's reaction to negative stimuli,32 result-
ing in more distress and thus leading to a vicious cycle.
Previous studies have shown that Type D personality is
also significantly associated with impaired sleep.29 In the
current study, Type D personality (the combination of high
NA and high SI) was also associated with sleep distur-
bance in univariate analyses, but not after adjusting for
demographic, clinical and psychological variables. In
accordance with our findings, a previous study which
found an association between Type D personality and sleep
problems also showed that NA was more strongly related
to sleep problems in adolescents, as compared to SI.29
To date, none of the studies have focused on the effects
of sleep disturbance on health status at 12 months post-
ICD-implantation. Our findings showed that sleep distur-
bance was associated with impaired health status, but that
this association was no longer significant after adjustment
for psychological variables. Here again, high NA/low SI
was the only predictor that was independently associated
with both impaired mental and physical health status.
These findings are in line with previous studies showing
an association between NA and impaired health status.33 In
addition, comorbidities, anxiety and Type D personality
were also associated with one of the components of health
status, which is in line with previous findings.11,34
A number of limitations must be acknowledged. First,
the WEBCARE trial was not designed to study sleep pat-
terns in patients with an ICD and, hence, current findings
should be interpreted with caution as the sample might not
be representative for the general ICD population. Second,
sleep disturbance was measured with one single item from
the PHQ-9. Nevertheless, PHQ-9 item #3 has been shown
to be an effective screener for identifying sleep distur-
bance and has been proven to significantly correlate with
the Insomnia Severity Index, a measure that adequately
assesses diagnostic criteria for insomnia.20 Sleep distur-
bance measured by PHQ-9 item #3 has also been associ-
ated with an increased occurrence of cardiovascular risk
factors and disease.2 However, using a one-item measure
might be associated with random measurement errors and
interpretation biases. In addition, reliability statistics can-
not be calculated with a one-item measure. Third, it was
not possible to diagnose and distinguish between different
kinds of sleep disorders like insomnia, obstructive sleep
apnoea and hypersomnia in this study. Fourth, due to the
relatively small sample size and the risk of overfitting the
regression models, it was not possible to adjust for all clin-
ical variables that might be of interest. Finally, only 37%
of the eligible patients were included in current analysis.
This might have resulted in a bias in current findings.
Hence, the results may not be representative for the gen-
eral ICD population. However, this is the first study to
determine the prevalence of sleep disturbance in patients
with an ICD during the course of 12 months post-implan-
tation, the predictors and the impact of sleep disturbance
on health status at the 12-month follow-up. In addition, as
advocated by the American Heart Association this study
presents the subjective, PROs which are considered as a
good measure of cardiovascular health.16
For clinical practice it would be recommended to iden-
tify younger patients with high levels of NAand offer them
support as needed to improve their sleep quality and poten-
tially their health status. Also patients with a Type D per-
sonality should be identified due to its impact on patients'
health status. This could be done using the 14-item DS14
questionnaire23 which could be administered within min-
utes. Patients could be identified at time of implantation
and offered support as soon as possible in order to decrease
long-term adjustment problems. Future studies should
focus on examining the relationship between NA and dis-
turbed sleep and also investigate whether the association
between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular health is
mediated by NA. In addition, larger studies with more
objective measures (e.g. daily monitoring with wearables)
are needed to replicate current findings and inform the
clinical practice.
Conclusions
Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with an ICD.
Current findings show that particularly younger patients with
high negative affectivity may experience disturbed sleep
post-ICD implantation. Sleep disturbance was not associated
with impaired health status at the 12-month follow-up.
Implications for practice
·
· Sleep disturbance in patients with an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be
addressed in clinical practice.
·
· Sleep disturbance remains relatively stable over
time after ICD implantation.
·
· Younger age is associated with sleep disturbance.
·
· Negative affectivity is associated with sleep
disturbance.
