Mortality Due to Gastroenteritis of Unknown
Etiology in the United States

Gastroenteritis of unknown etiology (GUE) is a significant cause of mortality in the United States. In the
present study, the demographic and medical characteristics of people who died of GUE were examined, using
the 1995­1997 Multiple Cause of Death files to calculate GUE death rates and proportionate mortality ratios.
There were 13,153 GUE deaths during the period, or 4400 deaths per year. Death rates were highest among
infants and elderly persons, especially nursing home residents, and increased during the winter months.
Compared with all decedents, GUE decedents were more likely to have certain other medical conditions,
including bacteremia, volume depletion, renal failure, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immu-
nodeficiency syndrome. Fatal GUE often appeared to be infectious in origin, but death certificates provide
insufficient information to determine whether the causative agents were unknown or foodborne. The accuracy
of GUE reporting on death certificates and the etiology of fatal GUE merit further investigation.
Gastroenteritis of unknown etiology (GUE) is a sig-
nificant cause of mortality in the United States. Mead
et al. [1] recently estimated that there are 5000 annual
deaths due to GUE and attributed these deaths to un-
known, predominantly foodborne agents. Information
about deaths due to GUE is limited, hindering efforts
to identify the sources of foodborne illness and improve
the safety of the US food supply. The purpose of the
present study is to examine the demographic and med-
ical aspects of GUE mortality, using the 1995­1997
Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files. GUE death rates
by age, sex, and other factors were calculated to assess
differences within the US population in exposure or
susceptibility to unidentified infectious agents. The
medical conditions associated with fatal GUE were also

examined using information about the other causes of
death for GUE decedents.
Previous studies of gastroenteritis mortality examined
deaths due to all categories of gastroenteritis, including
GUE, but did not describe GUE deaths in detail [2­7].
GUE is the most important category of gastroenteritis
mortality, accounting for 77% of all gastroenteritisdeaths
in 1992­1996 [1]. Mead et al. [1] proposed thatunknown
agents were the sole cause of fatal GUE and estimated
that 67% of GUE deaths were due to the foodborne
transmission of these agents. There is evidence that un-
known agents affect human health, because population-
based surveillance has detected unexplained deaths that
appeared to be caused by infections but were not asso-
ciated with known pathogens [8]. There is also evidence
that unknown agents may be transmitted by food, be-
cause the etiology of some well-documented outbreaks
of foodborne illness has not been determined despite
intensive investigations [9, 10], which suggests that un-
known agents were responsible.

1997 annual MCD files, which include most of the information
recorded on death certificates [11]. The causes of death re-
ported by physicians were coded by state vital statistics offices
and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), accord-
ing to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9), and were listed on the entity-axis of each death record
in the same sequence as on the death certificate [11, 12]. NCHS
also assigned an underlying cause of death, defined as the med-
ical condition that initiated the events leading to death. The
1995­1997 MCD files were combined for the present analysis,
to reduce random variation in the number of deaths in small
subpopulations. There were no significant changes in MCD
coding or processing procedures during the 1995­1997 period.
Five ICD-9 codes identify GUE: 009.0­009.3 and 558 (table
1). The codes for gastroenteritis and diarrhea of presumed in-
fectious origin (009.1 and 009.3) are invalid under World Health
Organization and NCHS mortality coding procedures and were
coded instead as 558 on the MCD files [12]. ICD-9 558 (other
noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis) also includes conditions
described simply as "gastroenteritis" or "diarrhea," as well as
radiation, toxic, and allergic gastroenteritis. Most of the condi-
tions coded as 558 are thought to be infectious in origin, despite
the title for this category [13]. NCHS assigned additional ICD-
9 codes on the MCD files that distinguished between radiation
and toxic gastroenteritis. Conditions due to medical exposure to
radiation, such as radiation gastroenteritis, were also coded as
E879.2 (abnormal reaction to a radiological procedure or ther-
apy) [12]. Conditions qualified as "toxic," such as toxic gastro-
enteritis, were assigned 2 additional codes that specified the na-
ture of poisoning and the external cause whenever poisoning was
also mentioned on the death certificate [12].
A GUE death was defined as any death of a US resident with
an ICD-9 code of 009.0, 009.2, or 558 on the entity-axis of the
death record, excluding deaths with a 558 code that were due
to radiation or toxic gastroenteritis. Deaths with a 558 code
were considered to be radiation or toxic gastroenteritis deaths
if a code for toxic poisoning or an abnormal reaction to a
radiological procedure or therapy appeared on the same line
or 1 line after 558 on the death certificate, when 558 was an
immediate or intervening cause of death, or on the same line
when 558 was an underlying or contributing cause. Deaths due
to allergic gastroenteritis, coded as ICD-9 558, could not be
distinguished from GUE deaths, but the number of such deaths
likely was small. Previous studies of gastroenteritis mortality
have also used ICD-9 009.0, 009.2, and 558 to identify GUE
deaths but did not exclude radiation or toxic gastroenteritis
deaths [1­3, 6].
Analysis of GUE mortality. The causes of death for GUE
decedents were examined to determine how often GUE was
the underlying cause of death and how often physicians re-
ported that GUE was infectious in origin, as indicated by ICD-
9 codes 009.0 (infectious gastroenteritis) or 009.2 (infectious
diarrhea). Average annual age-adjusted GUE death rates by age,
sex, race, and region were calculated to identify variations in
the risk of fatal GUE. Population denominators for death rates
were obtained from 1995­1997 annual postcensal estimates of
the US resident population by age, sex, race, and state [14­16].
Death rates were computed by dividing the number of GUE
deaths during 1995­1997 by the sum of the midyear (July)
1995­1997 populations for the specified group and age-ad-
justing on the basis of the 2000 US standard population [17].
Infant deaths were divided into neonatal and postneonatal
deaths, and average annual neonatal and postneonatalmortality
rates were calculated using the sum of 1995­1997 births as the
denominator [18]. Three race categories (whites, blacks, and
other races) were examined, but death rates were only calcu-
lated for whites and blacks, because mortality is known to be
underestimated for other races [19]. Deaths were classified by
region of residence using the 9 US census divisions, each of
which consisted of 3­9 contiguous states [20].
GUE death rates excluding decedents with human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS were also calculated to deter-
mine the effect of HIV/AIDS on GUE mortality patterns. De-
cedents with HIV/AIDS included any death with an ICD-9 code
for HIV/AIDS (042.0­044.9). Seasonal variations in GUE mor-
tality were analyzed by computing monthly GUE death rates.
Population denominators were obtained from monthly post-
censal estimates of the US resident population by age [14]. The
monthly death rates were age-adjusted and plotted to identify
seasonal patterns.
The number of GUE deaths was subject to random variation,
so a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each death
rate. Deaths were assumed to be distributed as a Poisson var-
iable when there were !100 deaths in a group and as a binomial
variable in other cases, in conformity with NCHS procedures
[21]. The postcensal population estimates used to compute
death rates were not subject to sampling error.
The proportion of GUE deaths in medical facilities, nursing
homes, and other places was examined using information about
the place of death. Approximate GUE death rates for elderly
persons (65 years old) who lived in nursing homes and other

settings were also calculated. Exact death rates could not be
determined, because an unknown number of nursing home
residents were transferred to medical facilities before death, and
a medical facility was reported as the place of death. Instead,
a lower limit of the death rate for nursing home residents and
an upper limit of the death rate for other elderly persons were
calculated by assuming that GUE deaths in nursing homes
included all nursing home residents who died from GUE. The
true GUE death rate was likely to be higher for nursing home
residents and lower for other elderly persons, depending on
how many fatal GUE cases were transferred from nursing
homes to medical facilities before death. The size and age dis-
tribution of the elderly nursing home population was estimated
using the 1995 and 1997 National Nursing Home Surveys
(NNHS) [22, 23]. The 1995 and 1997 NNHS estimates were
averaged to obtain the 1996 nursing home population, and the
other elderly population was determined by subtraction from
the total elderly population. The GUE death rate for each pop-
ulation was age-adjusted, and approximate 95% CIs were cal-
culated using a formula provided by NCHS, because the public-
use version of the NNHS files does not include the information
needed to determine exact SEs [21, 24].
Other causes of death. The association between fatal GUE
and other medical conditions was investigated by examining
every condition reported on 2% of GUE death records. Each
of the 5570 ICD-9 codes used on the MCD files was treated
as a separate condition, with 2 exceptions. The codes for HIV/
AIDS (042.0­044.9) were combined, because the individual
codes were not relevant for the analysis. The codes for extreme
immaturity (765.0) and other preterm infants (765.1) were also
combined, because these conditions were unlikely to be con-
sistently differentiated on death certificates. The combined
codes identify infants with short gestations (!38 weeks) or low
birth weights (!2500 g).
The relationship between GUE and each medical condition
was evaluated using a proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) to
determine whether GUE decedents were more likely to have
the condition than all decedents. Previous studies have used
PMRs in this manner to investigate hemochromatosis and neu-
rofibromatosis mortality [25, 26]. The PMR for a specified
condition was defined as the observed number of GUE deaths
associated with the condition divided by the expected number
of GUE deaths associated with the condition [27]. The expected
number of deaths was determined by multiplying the number
of GUE deaths by the proportion of all deaths associated with
the specified condition. Each PMR was standardized by sex and
age, using 8 age groups (!1, 1­24, 25­44, 45­54, 55­64, 65­74,
75­84, and 85 years). Following procedures used by the Na-
tional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 95% CIs
were computed by assuming that GUE deaths were distributed
as a Poisson variable when there were 1000 deaths with the
specified condition and as a binomial variable in other cases
[28]. The value of each PMR indicates whether GUE decedents
were more likely ( ), equally likely ( ), or
PMR 1 1.0 PMR p 1.0
less likely ( ) to have the specified condition than all
PMR ! 1.0
decedents.
The conditions associated with GUE were likely to vary by
age, so PMRs were also calculated for each condition reported
on 5% of the GUE death records for infants, nonelderly
persons (aged 1­64 years), or elderly persons (aged 65 years).
The expected number of GUE deaths associated with each con-
dition was determined in comparison to all deaths for the rel-
evant age group.
RESULTS
There were 13,153 deaths involving GUE during 1995­1997,
an average of 4384 GUE deaths/year. This estimate excludes
818 deaths from radiation gastroenteritis and 11 deaths from
toxic gastroenteritis. GUE was the underlying cause of death
for 34.2% of GUE decedents (table 2). GUE was more likely
to be the underlying cause of death for decedents aged !15
years old than for older decedents. Only 10.3% of fatal GUE
cases were reported to be infectious in origin, but the propor-
tion of infectious cases was much higher for infants (81.1%)
than other age groups. Approximately 2 of every 1000 deaths
involved GUE. GUE was a more important cause of death for
young children than older persons and was mentioned in 1.0%
of all deaths of persons aged !5 years old, including 2.7% of
postneonatal deaths (data not shown).
The characteristics of GUE decedents are summarized in
table 3. Most (74.3%) were elderly. A majority (57.1%) were
female, and most (86.1%) were white. Only a small proportion
(1.5%) were other races, a category that included American
Indians, Native Alaskans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.

death rate per 100,000 persons during 1995­1997 was 1.70
(95% CI, 1.67­1.73) (table 3). The death rate was higher for
infants and elderly persons than other age groups, reaching a
maximum of 32.73 for persons aged 85 years. Among infants,
postneonatal mortality was 7 times higher than neonatal mor-
tality ( ). GUE mortality was 12% higher for males than

The sex and racial differences in GUE mortality were reduced
when the 740 decedents with HIV/AIDS were excluded, because
these individuals were disproportionately male (84%) and black
(39%). In contrast, the age and regional differences were largely
unaffected. When HIV/AIDS decedents were excluded, the
GUE death rate was 4% higher for males than females (P p
) and 8% higher for blacks than whites ( ) (data
.020 P p .020
not shown). The racial difference in mortality was greatest dur-
ing infancy, when the death rate was 14 times higher for blacks
than whites ( ) (figure 1). The racial difference decreased
P ! .001
after infancy and was reversed at the oldest ages, with the white
death rate exceeding the black death rate at ages 75­84 years
( ) and 85 years ( ). The age pattern of mor-
P p .025 P ! .001
tality was J-shaped for whites but U-shaped for blacks because
of the higher mortality among black infants and lower mortality
among blacks aged 75 years.
There were regular seasonal variations in the monthly age-
adjusted GUE death rate during 1995­1997 (figure 2). For each
year, the death rate increased during the winter months and
decreased during the summer months. The maximum monthly
death rate, in December or January, was 52%­70% higher than
the minimum monthly death rate, in August or September
( in all 3 years). Approximately 47% of GUE deaths
P ! .001
occurred during the 5 months from December through April,
a period that included 41% of the calendar year.
Most GUE deaths occurred in inpatient hospital facilities
(63%) or other medical settings (6%), but 18% were in nursing
homes and 11% were in residences. Nearly all (96%) of the

GUE deaths in nursing homes occurred among elderly persons.
The estimated lower limit of the GUE death rate for elderly
nursing home residents was 38.91 (95% CI, 38.55­39.27). The
estimated upper limit of the GUE death rate for other elderly
persons was 8.50 (95% CI, 8.47­8.53); thus, GUE mortality
among elderly persons was substantially higher in nursing
homes ( ).

Medical conditions associated with GUE. The average
number of causes of death (including GUE) reported on death
certificates was 4.5 for GUE decedents versus 2.8 for other de-
cedents. The other causes of death reported in conjunction with
GUE included 31 medical conditions mentioned on 2% of
GUE death records. Twenty-one conditions had a PMR 11.0 and
were associated with fatal GUE (table 4). The most common
associated condition was unspecified septicemia (bacteremia),
which was mentioned in 16.4% of GUE deaths and occurred
3.93 times (95% CI, 3.84­4.01) more often than expected, in
comparison with all deaths. The second most common condition
was volume depletion. The other associated conditions included
a variety of disorders--notably, shock, renal failure, HIV/AIDS,
anemia, short gestation/low birth weight, and electrolyte and
fluid disorders.
Four conditions mentioned on 2% of GUE death records
had a PMR of 1.0 and occurred as often as expected among
GUE decedents, including cardiac arrest and diabetes without
mention of complication (data not shown). The other 6 con-
ditions mentioned on 2% of GUE death records had a PMR
!1.0 and occurred less often than expected, including 5 car-
diovascular conditions (data not shown).
Differences by age. Conditions with a PMR 11.0 men-
tioned on 5% of the GUE death records for infants, noneld-
erly, or elderly persons are reported in table 5. Fatal GUE was
associated with bacteremia, volume depletion, shock, and renal
failure in all 3 age groups and with respiratory arrest, cardiac
arrest, and pneumonia in 2 age groups. The most common
conditions were short gestation/low birth weight and bacter-
emia in infants; HIV/AIDS and bacteremia in nonelderly per-
sons; and bacteremia and volume depletion in elderly persons.
Nine conditions appeared in only 1 age group: short gestation/
low birth weight, chronic perinatal respiratory disease (bron-
chopulmonary dysplasia), and other specified intestinal dis-
orders in infants; HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cytomegalic inclusion
disease (cytomegalovirus infection), and cachexia in nonelderly
persons; and chronic airway obstruction and malnutrition in
elderly persons.
DISCUSSION
The present study confirms that GUE is a significant cause of
death in the United States. GUE was associated with 4400
deaths/year during 1995­1997. The annual number of GUE
deaths was comparable to the mortality burden from 3 diseases
with infectious etiologies: cervical cancer (4400 deaths), rheu-
matic fever and heart disease (4800 deaths), and hepatitis B
virus infections (4400­6000 deaths) [29­31]. The estimate of
4400 annual GUE deaths is 12% lower than the estimate of
5000 annual GUE deaths by Mead et al. [1], in part because
the present study excluded nearly 300 annual radiation and
toxic gastroenteritis deaths. The present study also relied ex-
clusively on death certificate data, whereas Mead et al. [1] av-
eraged separate estimates on the basis of death certificate and
hospital discharge data. The use of hospital discharge data to
estimate the number of GUE deaths is problematic, because
29% of the GUE deaths reported on death certificates occurred
outside medical facilities.
The MCD files provide considerable information about the
demographic and medical characteristics of GUE deaths. The
underlying cause of death for 66% of GUE decedents was a
medical condition other than GUE, which suggests that fatal
GUE usually occurred in individuals who were already ill and
were probably more susceptible to infection. However, only
10% of fatal GUE cases were reported to be infectious, as in-
dicated by the proportion of deaths with ICD-9 009.0 or 009.2
codes. Physicians may have described other GUE cases as pre-
sumed infections, but these cases could not be identified be-
cause the ICD-9 codes for gastroenteritis and diarrhea of pre-
sumed infectious origin (009.1 and 009.3) were not used on
the MCD files.
GUE deaths in children had strikingly different character-
istics from other GUE deaths. GUE was the predominant un-
derlying cause of death for GUE decedents !15 years old, and
most fatal GUE in infants was reported to be infectious. Both
characteristics are consistent with gastrointestinal infections
that were recognized at the time of death, although the causative
agent was not reported on death certificates. GUE was also a
more important cause of mortality for infants and young chil-
dren than older persons, particularly during the postneonatal

period. On the basis of the definition used in the present study,
GUE would have been the sixth leading cause of death for
postneonates in 1997, after sudden infant death syndrome, con-
genital anomalies, accidents, pneumonia and influenza, and
homicide [32].
There were large variations in the risk of death from GUE,
especially by age. GUE death rates were substantially higher
among infants and elderly persons than other age groups, and
the age pattern of mortality resembled that for all categories
of gastroenteritis combined [3]. Individuals 75 years old had
the highest GUE death rates and accounted for 58% of all GUE
deaths. Infants had the second highest GUE death rate and
accounted for 7% of deaths. The age pattern of GUE mortality
may reflect age-related variations in exposure or susceptibility
to unknown agents. Elderly persons are particularly susceptible
to many foodborne agents because of changes in the immune
and gastrointestinal systems during aging [33, 34].
The higher mortality rate from GUE during the postneonatal
period than the neonatal period was unusual, because infant
mortality from most major causes of death is lower during the
postneonatal period [32]. One exception was infectious disease,
which caused more deaths among postneonates than neonates
[35]. The lower GUE mortality rate among neonates was not
an artifact of the modified ICD-9 coding procedures for the
MCD files, because the coding of infant gastroenteritis did not
depend on age [12].
Elderly nursing home residents had the highest risk of GUE
mortality of any group examined in the present study and
accounted for 17% of all GUE deaths, although they represent
!1% of the US population. The risk of fatal GUE was 14 times
higher for elderly nursing home residents than other elderly
persons, which confirms that GUE was a special problem for
nursing home residents [3]. The difference in GUE mortality
between nursing home residents and other elderly persons is
almost certainly understated, because some persons with fatal
GUE were probably transferred from nursing homes to medical
facilities before death and, therefore, were classified in the pres-
ent study as "other elderly" persons. One study of nursing home
residents found that one-fourth of those who died were dis-
charged to a hospital before death [36]. If a similar proportion
of nursing home residents with fatal GUE were hospitalized
before death, then the GUE death rate has been substantially
underestimated for nursing home residents and overestimated
for other elderly persons.

The elevated risk of fatal GUE in the nursing home popu-
lation is not surprising, because nursing home residents have
high rates of chronic illness, malnutrition, and functional im-
pairments, such as bowel incontinence, that are conducive to
the spread of infection [37]. Outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis
are common in nursing homes [38], including many attributed
to unidentified foodborne agents [39]. Recent studies based on
new molecular diagnostic methods have indicated that most
gastroenteritis outbreaks of unknown etiology in nursing homes
were actually caused by Norwalk-like viruses [40, 41]. This
finding suggests that some GUE deaths in nursing homes were
also due to Norwalk-like viruses. The role of Norwalk-like vi-
ruses in adult gastroenteritis mortality has not yet been estab-
lished, but these agents might eventually emerge as an impor-
tant cause of sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis, as well as
mass outbreaks [42].
The risk of GUE mortality varied by sex, race, and region, as
well as by age and nursing home residence. Much of the differ-
ence in mortality by sex and race was due to the high proportion
of males and blacks among GUE decedents with HIV/AIDS.Even
after decedents with HIV/AIDS were excluded, the risk of fatal
GUE was higher for males than females and for blacks than
whites. The reason why the risk was higher for males is unclear,
but sex differences in behavior affecting exposure to unknown
448 · JID 2003:187 (1 February) · Frenzen
foodborne agents might play a role. Compared with females,
males were more likely to engage in several unsafe food prepa-
ration and consumption practices that increased exposure to
pathogens in foods of animal origin [43, 44].
The racial difference in GUE mortality varied by age and
was reversed at the oldest ages. However, the mortality "cross-
over" at the oldest ages was probably exaggerated by age mis-
reporting on death certificates for elderly blacks, which causes
black death rates to be underestimated at the oldest ages [45,
46]. As a result, the true age pattern of GUE mortality for
blacks might be J-shaped rather than U-shaped. The reason
for the racial difference in GUE mortality was unknown, but
the relationship between GUE and short gestation/low birth
weight suggests that racial differences in birth characteristics
might contribute to the higher GUE mortality among black
infants. In 1999, 22% of black births were preterm (!37 weeks
gestation) or low birth weight (!2500 g), compared with 13%
of white births [47]. Other factors increasing GUE mortality
among black infants might include racial differences in ma-
ternal characteristics affecting the use of medical care [2, 6].
The regional variation in GUE mortality was greater than
the differences by sex or race. The GUE death rate was 26%
higher in New England than in the Mountain census division,
the regions with the highest and lowest GUE mortality. Geo-
graphic variations in the incidence of illness may be typical of
foodborne agents. For example, the Foodborne Diseases Active
Surveillance Network (FoodNet) [48] has found large geo-
graphic variations in the incidence of culture-confirmed illness
due to most of the foodborne pathogens under surveillance.
The seasonal increase in GUE mortality during the winter
months was suggestive of a viral etiology, because the incidence
of gastroenteritis due to Norwalk-like viruses, rotavirus, and
astrovirus is also higher during the winter months [49­51]. In
contrast, the incidence of culture-confirmed illness due to most
of the foodborne bacterial and parasitic pathogens monitored
by FoodNet was higher during the summer months or else did
not vary seasonally [48]. Viral agents that cause acute gastro-
enteritis, including Norwalk-like viruses, rotavirus, and astro-
virus, are less likely to be transmitted by food than are most
other gastrointestinal pathogens [1], so the unknown agents
that caused GUE may not have been predominantly foodborne.
The present study did not examine age differences in the sea-
sonality of GUE mortality, because the monthly number of GUE
deaths for most age groups was subject to a high degree of
random variation. Other studies have found that deaths from all
categories of gastroenteritis were higher during the winter among
young children and elderly persons, although the winter peak
among children became less prominent after 1985, probably be-
cause of a decrease in rotavirus mortality [3, 52]. Rotavirus often
causes severe gastroenteritis in children, but many rotavirus in-
fections are never identified [53]. However, few GUE deaths were
likely to be unidentified rotavirus infections, because rotavirus
is estimated to cause only 20 deaths/year [54].
Physicians reported more causes of death, on average, for
GUE decedents than other decedents, which suggests that GUE
cases were relatively more complicated. The PMRs comparing
GUE deaths with all deaths indicate that a variety of different
medical conditions were associated with fatal GUE. Many of
these conditions were indicative of incomplete reporting of the
causes of death. Ten conditions had ICD-9 codes with the term
"unspecified" in the title, because physicians did not provide
enough information to allow coders to assign a more specific
code. Two other conditions--respiratory arrest and shock--are
cited on the US standard death certificate as examples of modes
of dying that should not be reported as causes of death [11].
It was unclear why physicians reported these nonspecific con-
ditions. One possible explanation is that the conditions were
caused by the same unknown agents responsible for fatal GUE,
precluding a complete diagnosis. Alternatively, nonspecific di-
agnoses may have been erroneously recorded on death certif-
icates in place of specific diagnoses [55].
Bacteremia was the condition most commonly associated
with fatal GUE. The etiology of bacteremia was apparently un-
determined, because bloodstream infections were coded as
ICD-9 038.9 (unspecified septicemia) when there was no men-
tion of a causative agent on the death certificate. Gastroenteritis
is a possible complication of bacteremia [56], so some cases of
GUE may have resulted from infections of sites other than the
gastrointestinal tract. However, the association between GUE
and bacteremia may also indicate that unknown agents that
caused GUE could invade the bloodstream, like certain gastro-
intestinal pathogens, notably Salmonella species.
Several other conditions associated with GUE were possible
complications of severe gastroenteritis, including volume de-
pletion, shock, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and cardiac arrest
[3]. Volume depletion occurred 9.6 times more often than ex-
pected and was present in 13% of GUE deaths, making it the
second most common condition associated with GUE. The
frequent mention of volume depletion may indicate that GUE
decedents did not always receive timely treatment for gastro-
intestinal fluid losses. Volume depletion was less likely to be
present in GUE deaths among infants (5%) than nonelderly
(12%) or elderly (14%) persons, perhaps because infants were
more likely to receive rehydration therapy.
Some conditions associated with GUE could also be caused
by Shiga toxin­producing pathogens (Shigella dysenteriae type 1,
Escherichia coli O157:H7, and other Shiga toxin­producing E.
coli strains). Infection by these pathogens may result in hem-
orrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome (characterized by
acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia),
as well as gastroenteritis. Nearly 4% of GUE decedents had gas-
trointestinal hemorrhage and 2% had vascular insufficiency of
Gastroenteritis of Unknown Etiology · JID 2003:187 (1 February) · 449
the intestine (ischemic colitis), conditions similar to hemorrhagic
colitis. GUE was not associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome
but was associated with acute renal failure (7% of decedents)
and unspecified anemia (4% of decedents). Overall, 13% of GUE
decedents had gastrointestinal hemorrhage,ischemiccolitis,acute
renal failure, or unspecified anemia.
Shiga toxin­producing pathogens are estimated to cause
160 deaths per year [1], assuming that S. dysenteriae type 1
is responsible for most of the estimated deaths due to Shigella
species. However, only 20 deaths/year are reported on death
certificates, under the assumption that all of the deaths on the
1995­1997 MCD files with ICD-9 codes for shigellosis (004.0­
004.9), E. coli infections (008.0), or other bacterial food poi-
soning (005.8) were caused by Shiga toxin­producing patho-
gens. The discrepancy between the numbers of reported and
estimated deaths implies that most fatal infections due to Shiga
toxin­producing pathogens were not reported on death cer-
tificates. Some of these unreported infections may have been
included instead among the GUE deaths involving gastroin-
testinal hemorrhage, ischemic colitis, acute renal failure, or
unspecified anemia.
GUE was associated with unspecified renal failure and disorder
of the kidney and ureter, as well as acute renal failure. One or
more of these conditions was reported in 13% of GUE deaths.
GUE decedents were more likely than all decedents to have cer-
tain conditions that could result in renal failure, including bac-
teremia, volume depletion, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
GUE decedents who were hospitalized before death were also at
risk of nosocomial renal insufficiency [57].
Other conditions associated with GUE made individuals
more susceptible to infection. The most important example
was HIV/AIDS, which was present in 6% of GUE deaths and
occurred 4.0 times more often than expected. Nearly all (99%)
of the GUE decedents with HIV/AIDS were nonelderly persons.
Some (24%) of the nonelderly persons with HIV/AIDS also
had cytomegalovirus infections, a common cause of diarrhea
in patients with HIV/AIDS [58]. It was unclear whether cy-
tomegalovirus was responsible for gastroenteritis in these de-
cedents, because cytomegalovirus can affect other organs with-
out involving the gastrointestinal tract.
Chronic illness may also predispose individuals to infection.
Five of the conditions associated with GUE typically occurred
in chronically ill or debilitated individuals, including pneu-
monia due to unspecified organisms, chronic airway obstruc-
tion, malnutrition, organic brain syndrome, and pneumonitis
due to inhalation of food or vomitus. Overall, 25% of GUE
deaths involved 1 of these 5 conditions, including 33% of
the deaths among elderly nursing home residents. The asso-
ciation with GUE was strongest in the case of malnutrition,
which occurred 3.9 times more often than expected.
The association between GUE and pneumonia might also
indicate that fatal pneumonia due to unidentified agents some-
times involved gastrointestinal symptoms. Acute gastroenteritis
of unknown etiology accompanied by respiratory symptoms
has traditionally been attributed to respiratory, rather than gas-
trointestinal, pathogens [1]. If the 420 annual GUE deaths as-
sociated with pneumonia due to unspecified organisms were
classified as respiratory rather than gastrointestinal mortality,
the number of GUE deaths would be reduced by nearly 10%.
The classification of GUE deaths involving pneumonia is less
consequential for estimates of respiratory mortality, because
this group of GUE deaths represented only 0.2% of the 187,000
annual deaths on the 1995­1997 MCD files with ICD-9 code
486 for pneumonia due to unspecified organisms.
A majority (56%) of infant GUE deaths were premature or
low birth weight. Fatal GUE might be associated with short
gestations because the immune response is more deficient in
premature infants than other infants [56], increasing the risk
of infection. Low birth weight has also been identified as a risk
factor for infant mortality from all categories of gastroenteritis
[6]. The association between GUE and 2 other conditions in
infants might be related to the use of dexamethasone; infant
GUE deaths were 3.6 times more likely to involve broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia and 21.2 times more likely to involve other
specified disorders of the intestine than all infant deaths. Bron-
chopulmonary dysplasia develops in premature infants receiv-
ing mechanical ventilatory support and is sometimes treated
with dexamethasone, an adrenocortical steroid that impairs the
immune response [59]. Low-birth-weight infants treated with
dexamethasone are also at risk of perforation of the intestine,
one of the conditions classified under other specified disorders
of the intestine [60].
Possible explanations for the association between GUE and
2 other conditions can also be identified. The most likely ex-
planation for the association with cardiac dysrhythmia was dis-
turbance of cardiac function by electrolyte imbalances resulting
from severe diarrhea [56]. Dysrhythmia might also result from
the use of drugs with proarrhythmic effects, such as erythro-
mycin, a macrolide antibiotic recommended for treating di-
arrhea due to Campylobacter species, the most common cause
of foodborne gastroenteritis [61, 62]. The most likely expla-
nation for the association between GUE and urinary tract in-
fections was nosocomial infection, because diarrhea is a risk
factor for nosocomial urinary tract infections, particularly in
patients with an indwelling catheter [63]. Alternatively, the un-
known agents that caused GUE may have been able to invade
the urinary tract, like one of the most common gastrointestinal
pathogens, Salmonella species [64].
In summary, the information reported on death certificates
suggests that fatal GUE was often due to infectious agents. All
of the GUE deaths where gastroenteritis was described as in-
fectious in origin and coded as ICD-9 009.0 or 009.2 probably
450 · JID 2003:187 (1 February) · Frenzen
involved infectious agents. Infectious agents likely were also
present when GUE was the underlying cause of death and when
GUE occurred together with bacteremia or pneumonia. Other
aspects of GUE mortality that were consistent with an infectious
etiology included the seasonal increase in mortality during the
winter months [3] and the association with HIV/AIDS and
certain chronic conditions, such as malnutrition, that increased
susceptibility to infection.
Although fatal GUE was often due to infectious agents, the
information provided on death certificates was insufficient to
determine whether GUE was caused by unknown, predomi-
nantly foodborne agents, as proposed by Mead et al. [1]. Death
certificates do not indicate why physicians ruled out known
causes of gastroenteritis or record how the agents that caused
GUE were transmitted. More research is needed to assess how
GUE was diagnosed and to identify the risk factors for fatal
GUE to determine whether the agents that caused GUE were
unknown or transmitted by food.
The most important limitation of the present study is the
uncertain accuracy of death certificate data on causes of death.
Reported causes of death may be incomplete or even inaccurate
[65­68]. The most frequent errors made by physicians include
omitting some causes of death and listing nonspecific rather
than specific diagnoses [55, 66]. Infectious conditions are par-
ticularly likely to be underreported, including conditions due
to gastrointestinal pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus and Cryp-
tosporidium parvum [1, 69, 70]. The accuracy of gastroenteritis
reporting on death certificates has not been investigated and
merits attention, in view of the effect on estimates of GUE
mortality. One important issue is whether physicians correctly
ruled out known causes of gastroenteritis, such as Shiga toxin­
producing pathogens or adverse drug reactions [71]. Another
important issue is whether physicians sometimes erroneously
reported a nonspecific diagnosis of gastroenteritis or diarrhea,
rather than a specific cause such as a known pathogen.
Other shortcomings of death certificate data include the un-
reliable information about American Indian, Native Alaskan,
Asian, and Pacific Islander mortality, the errors in age report-
ing for elderly blacks, and the absence of a variable identify-
ing nursing home residents. In addition, information about
whether GUE was described as a presumed infection on death
certificates was not available, because ICD-9 codes 009.1 and
009.3, for gastroenteritis and diarrhea of presumed infectious
origin, were not used on the MCD files.
The PMRs used in the present study also have limitations.
A high PMR for one condition will necessarily result in a low
PMR for other conditions, because the PMR is a ratio and the
number of deaths from all causes is fixed [27]. This relationship
may explain why GUE decedents were less likely to have certain
cardiovascular conditions than all decedents. However, PMRs
are a good approximation of standardized mortality ratios when
the 2 groups being compared have the same overall death rate
from all causes [27]. The true group at risk of fatal GUE is
unknown, but the results from the present study indicate that
most or all of the US population was likely to be at risk, because
GUE deaths occurred in every age, sex, race, and geographic
category examined. Therefore, the group at risk of fatal GUE
probably had the same overall death rate as the US population,
and the PMRs reported here are likely to approximate stan-
dardized mortality ratios.
The PMR analysis involved multiple comparisons, increasing
the likelihood that GUE would be significantly associated with
some conditions simply by chance. At the conventional sig-
nificance level of , 1 or 2 of 31 conditions reported in
P p .05
2% of GUE deaths would be associated with GUE by chance.
In fact, 21 conditions were associated with GUE, so most of
the associations were unlikely to be due to chance. Many of
the conditions associated with GUE were possible complica-
tions of gastroenteritis, disorders that could be caused by
known gastrointestinal pathogens or conditions that increased
susceptibility to infection, further increasing confidence in the
validity of the analysis.
The GUE death rates reported here are provisional, because
the postcensal population estimates for 1995­1997 will ulti-
mately be superseded by intercensal estimates. The postcensal
estimates are projections based on the 1990 census, whereas
the intercensal estimates are interpolations based on the 1990
and 2000 censuses. At the time of the study, intercensal esti-
mates were available only for the US population by state and
age [72]. The intercensal estimate of the 1995­1997 US pop-
ulation was 1.6% higher than the postcensal estimate, because
the population enumerated in 2000 was larger than had been
projected [73]. As a result, the GUE death rates reported here
would be slightly lower if intercensal population estimates were
used for the denominator in place of the postcensal estimates.
The findings from the present study have important impli-
cations for efforts to reduce gastroenteritis mortality. Many
GUE deaths occurred in individuals who were susceptible to
infection, including patients with HIV/AIDS, persons with
chronic illness, and nursing home residents. Other GUE deaths
were associated with serious conditions, such as bacteremia or
acute renal failure, that may have been caused by the same
unknown agents responsible for GUE. It may be difficult or
impossible to prevent such deaths without first achieving a
better understanding of the etiology of GUE.
