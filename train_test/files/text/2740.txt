Abstract
Background: Across the United States, many states have actively banned the sale of soda in high schools, and
evidence suggests that students' in-school access to soda has declined as a result. However, schools may be
substituting soda with other sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and national trends indicate that adolescents are
consuming more sports drinks and energy drinks. This study examined whether students consumed more non-
soda SSBs in states that banned the sale of soda in school.
Methods: Student data on consumption of various SSBs and in-school access to vending machines that sold SSBs
were obtained from the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS), conducted in 2010. Student
data were linked to state laws regarding the sale of soda in school in 2010. Students were cross-classified based on
their access to vending machines and whether their state banned soda in school, creating 4 comparison groups.
Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to compare these 4 groups with respect to students' self-
reported consumption of diet soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, or other SSBs. Students who had access
to vending machines in a state that did not ban soda were the reference group. Models were adjusted for race/
ethnicity, sex, grade, home food access, state median income, and U.S. Census region.
Results: Students consumed more servings of sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and other SSBs if they
resided in a state that banned soda in school but attended a school with vending machines that sold other SSBs.
Similar results were observed where schools did not have vending machines but the state allowed soda to be sold
in school. Intake was generally not elevated where both states and schools limited SSB availability ­ i.e., states
banned soda and schools did not have SSB vending machines.
Conclusion: State laws that ban soda but allow other SSBs may lead students to substitute other non-soda SSBs.
Additional longitudinal research is needed to confirm this. Elevated SSB intake was not observed when both states
and schools took steps to remove SSBs from school.
Background
For decades, diet patterns around the world have shifted
toward greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages
(SSBs) [1]. Some of the most striking trends have occurred
in the United States (U.S.), where the proportion of daily
energy intake that came from SSBs increased from 4.8% to
10.3% from 1977-78 to 1999-2001 [2]. The proportion was
even higher among 12- to 19-year-olds, who consumed
13.5% of their energy from SSBs in 1999-2000 [3]. By
2005-06, soda alone accounted for more energy than any
other food/beverage group among 14- to 18-year-olds
(approximately 946 kJ/day) [4]. Overall SSB consumption
has declined in the past decade [3,5], but 12- to 19 year-
olds still consumed 10.5% of their energy from SSBs in
2009-10 [3].
These trends have become a prominent public health
concern due to the large volume of evidence that SSB
consumption is associated with increased weight gain
and cardio-metabolic risk factors [6-8]. In response to
these concerns, state and local policymakers in the U.S.
have aggressively targeted adolescent soda consumption,
often by banning the sale of soda in schools. School

district policies that ban soda increased rapidly starting in
2006-2007 [9], when districts that participated in federal
school meal programs were required to design a wellness
policy to target nutrition and physical activity [10]. Sev-
eral studies have since reported that schools were less
likely to sell soda if their state or district had a policy
banning soda sales in schools [11-14]. Overall, the pro-
portion of high school students in the U.S. who could
purchase soda in school was cut in half in a 5-year span
(from 53.6% in 2006-2007 to 25.3% in 2010-2011) [15].
Trends in adolescent soda consumption reversed dur-
ing this time, as adjusted mean intake decreased from
approximately 1,255 to 1,046 kJ/day from 1999-2000 to
2007-2008 [5]. Evidence also suggests, however, that ado-
lescents may be replacing soda with other SSBs. The
decrease in soda consumption was balanced by a nearly
equal increase in adjusted mean consumption of energy
drinks and sports drinks (approximately 531 to 699 kJ/
day) [5]. Most countries have not measured beverage-
specific trends as extensively, but a study in South Korea
also reported that adolescent soda intake was stable from
2001 to 2009, whereas intake from miscellaneous SSBs,
including sports/energy drinks, increased [16].
Adolescents often perceive these beverages as healthy
alternatives to soda [17] and beverage companies adver-
tise them as such [18]. However, sports drink consump-
tion has been actively discouraged by the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) because of sports drinks'
high calorie and sugar content [19], and energy drink
consumption has been strongly discouraged by the AAP
[19], American Medical Association [20], and Interna-
tional Society of Sports Nutrition [21] because of energy
drinks' high caffeine content and understudied additives
such as taurine and guarana [22]. Few countries care-
fully track adverse health events that are tied to energy
drink consumption, but several adverse events have
been reported in Germany and New Zealand [22]. Some
countries, including Turkey and Uruguay, have banned
energy drinks entirely [22].
Policymakers in the U.S. have not targeted non-soda
SSBs as aggressively. The Institute of Medicine (IOM)
recommends that all SSBs be banned in schools [23,24],
but this degree of restriction is rare. In 2010-11, 47% of
high school students were in a district that banned soda
in vending machines, but only 6% were in a district that
banned all SSBs in vending machines [9]. In the same
year, 87.8% of high school students nationwide reported
having access to some type of SSB in school [15]. State
laws that ban all SSBs in high schools are virtually non-
existent [25]. The Alliance School Beverage Guidelines,
created from a partnership between the American Bev-
erage Association, American Heart Association, and
Clinton Foundation [26], permitted the sale of sports
drinks and low-calorie soda (up to 10 calories per 8
ounces) in public and private high schools.
In the absence of more comprehensive policies, there
is growing evidence of schools substituting soda with
other SSBs. Studies in California [11] and Washington
[27] reported that non-soda SSBs were widely available
in schools even after sodas were removed. A U.S.
national study also reported that student-reported access
to SSBs did not decline if states only banned soda [12].
No study, to our knowledge, has examined whether
similar substitution patterns have occurred in response
to policies in other countries.
The notion of individuals substituting soda with other
SSBs, in response to policy change, is frequently dis-
cussed but rarely studied. Other policy initiatives have
been struck down on the rationale that people would
simply substitute; when the New York City Board of
Health attempted to limit SSB portion sizes, for exam-
ple, state courts blocked the proposal in part because
the limits would not apply to all SSBs in all locations
[28]. Some experts have questioned the effectiveness of
SSB taxes for similar reasons [29,30]. Simulation studies
suggested that policies could reduce caloric intake even
when substitution was taken into account [31-33], but
these results were largely theoretical, not based on
empirical data or randomized trials. Little research has
directly examined whether policies that target soda are
associated with higher consumption of non-soda SSBs.
This study was designed to analyze substitution pat-
terns, particularly examining whether high school stu-
dents consumed more sports drinks, energy drinks, and
other SSBs if their state banned soda in school.
Methods
This cross-sectional study linked student data from the
National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study
(NYPANS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) in spring 2010, with state
laws regarding the sale of soda in school venues during
the 2009-10 school year. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of Illinois
at Chicago and the University of Texas Health Science
Center at Houston.
Student sample
NYPANS was designed to measure diet, physical activity,
and sedentary behaviors, weight status, and environmen-
tal determinants of these measures in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of 9th-12th grade students [34]. Students
were sampled using a 3-stage cluster sample design; the
school response rate was 82%, the student response rate
was 88%, and the overall response rate was 73%. In total,
10,887 public school students participated in NYPANS.

For the purpose of our study, students were excluded
if they were missing data on self-reported vending
machine access within school (n=691), SSB consumption
(n=98), or other variables of interest (n=208), or if they
were unsure if vending machines that sold SSBs were
available in school (n=1,194). Students who were
excluded did not differ from the study sample with
respect to sex, weight status, vending machine access, or
consumption of most sweetened and unsweetened bev-
erages, but they were more likely to be racial/ethnic
minorities (p<0.001), tended to be in lower grade levels
(p<0.001), and tended to consume more diet soda,
energy drinks, and coffee/tea than students in the study
sample (p<0.001). The final study sample included 8,696
students in 27 states.
Student-level measures
All student data that were utilized in this study were
obtained using a written questionnaire completed in class.
The NYPANS questionnaire was similar in format to the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey that has been administered by
the CDC in odd-numbered years since 1991 to study
health risk behaviors in 9th-12th grade students [35]. Our
outcomes of interest were overall consumption of various
SSBs other than regular soda, including diet soda, sports
drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and "other" SSBs (e.g.,
<100% fruit juice, flavored milk), each of which was mea-
sured using separate items. Students were asked to report
the number of times they consumed each beverage in the
previous 7 days; response options ranged from zero to
"4 or more per day." The questionnaire instructed students
to include consumption from all locations. It should be
pointed out that there was overlap between the questions
for coffee/tea and "other SSBs," as the latter included a list
of examples that included "coffee drinks" and "sweetened
tea." It should also be pointed out that the question for
coffee/tea included "any kind of tea," not necessarily
sweetened.
Students also reported whether the school had "a
vending machine that students can use to purchase soda
or pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100%
juice, such as Coke, Gatorade, or Sunny Delight." Here-
after, we use the term "vending machines" to refer spe-
cifically to this type of vending machine.
Other survey data that were utilized in this study were
race/ethnicity, sex, grade, and home food access. Race and
ethnicity were measured separately; for the purpose of this
study, students were classified as non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic Other.
Home food access was measured by asking students to
report how often fruits and vegetables were available at
home and how often chips/cookies/cakes were available at
home. Both items included 5 responses ranging from
"never" to "always." For the purpose of this study, students
were classified based on whether they usually or always
had access to fruits and vegetables only, chips/cookies/
cakes only, both, or neither.
State data
Laws regarding the availability of soda in high school
vending machines, school stores, and cafeterias (a la carte)
in the 2009-2010 school year were obtained from the
Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research databases. Laws
were double-coded by two trained coders and verified
against secondary source state law data to ensure complete
collection and coding interpretation. [36-38]. Laws for the
three venues were analyzed separately and then combined
to create one binary indicator of whether the state prohib-
ited soda in all three venues. If a state banned soda only in
specific venues (n=5), it was coded as a `0' because this
essentially meant that soda was not banned. These laws
were compiled by the Bridging the Gap research program
at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
To be clear, a school could adhere to state law by
offering vending machines that sold SSBs other than
soda. If students reported that vending machines were
available, this was not an indication that schools were
not adhering to state law, as schools could adhere by
offering other SSBs. We explored studying whether laws
were more effective if states banned SSBs other than
soda, but no state in NYPANS had such restrictions on
the high school level in 2009-10.
Analyses also utilized state data on Census region
(Northeast, South, Midwest, or West) and median
household income, which were obtained from the 2010
U.S. Census.
Statistical analysis
All analyses used a zero-inflated negative binomial model
due to the highly-skewed distributions of SSB consump-
tion. For each SSB in this study, a large proportion of the
sample consumed zero servings and a small proportion
consumed a large quantity. For example, 42% of students
consumed zero servings of sports drinks in the past 7
days, but 11% consumed 14 or more servings of sports
drinks (mean=3.5, SD=6.0). The zero-inflated negative
binomial model estimates both the log odds of students
reporting zero servings and the log count of servings that
they consumed [39].
In analyses of state soda laws, students were cross-classi-
fied based on whether their state banned the sale of soda
in all school venues and whether their school had vending
machines that sold other SSBs. This categorization scheme
was chosen because soda bans that are similar, on paper,
may have a different effect in practice if students still have
access to other SSBs in vending machines. The reference
group was students who had access to vending machines
in school and resided in a state that allowed soda in

school. Indicator variables were used to mark the other 3
groups: 1) students who had access to vending machines
in a state that banned soda, 2) students with no access to
vending machines in a state that allowed soda in school,
and 3) students with no access to vending machines in a
state that banned soda.
Each model controlled for race/ethnicity (reference
group: non-Hispanic White), sex (reference group: boys),
grade (continuous), home food access (reference group:
access to fruits/vegetables only), Census region, and state
median income (log-transformed) in the logistic portion
of the model, and race/ethnicity, sex, grade, and home
food access in the negative binomial portion of the
model. Census region was modeled as a 3-category
variable ­ South/Midwest (reference group), Northeast,
West ­ because there were no Midwestern states in
NYPANS that banned soda.
Analyses were conducted in the overall sample and
then repeated by race/ethnicity and sex. This stratifica-
tion was conducted because consumption of specific
SSBs has been found to vary by race/ethnicity and sex
[5,40]. All analyses utilized Stata, Version 13.

Census region and racial/ethnic distributions differed
considerably across categories of state laws. Specifically,
no Midwestern states in the study banned soda. Due in
part to the demographics of the Midwestern states,
which tend to have a relatively large proportion of non-
Hispanic White residents, students who resided in a
state that did not ban soda were far more likely to be
non-Hispanic White (64.4% vs. 44.9%) and less likely to
be Hispanic (12.3% vs. 31.1%). Overall, students con-
sumed an average of 5.4 servings of soda per week;
among the SSBs that we analyzed in this study, `other
SSBs' such as <100% fruit juice were the most heavily
consumed (4.1), followed by sports drinks (3.5). Students
in states with no soda ban were more likely to report
having access to SSB vending machines (84.0%), but
such vending machines were still widely available in
states with soda bans (68.9%).
Results from analyses of state soda laws and school
vending machine access are presented in Table 2. Para-
meter estimates in Table 2 represent the difference in log
odds of reporting zero servings ("logistic") and difference
in the log number of servings consumed in the past 7
days ("negative binomial"). Here, to make results more
interpretable, we present the relative measures of con-
sumption (e.g., RR=relative number of servings per week)
that are calculated from the parameters in Table 2.
Consistently, state laws banning soda and vending
machine access were not associated with the odds of
reporting zero/no servings of SSBs. (As a reminder, the
reference is students who had access to vending
machines in a state that allowed soda.) Among SSB con-
sumers, however, the quantity of consumption tended to
be higher in 2 of the 3 comparison groups ­ 1) students
with access to vending machines in a state that banned
soda, and 2) students with no access to vending
machines in a state that did not ban soda. In other
words, SSB consumption tended to be higher if indivi-
dual state or school restrictions on SSB access were in
place, but usually not if both state and school restric-
tions were in place.
For example, students who had access to vending
machines in a state that banned soda in schools
(n=2229) consumed 1.25 times as many servings of
sports drinks in the past 7 days (RR=1.25=exp(0.23),
95% CI: 1.11, 1.42). They also consumed more energy
drinks (RR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.62), coffee/tea
(RR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.36), and other SSBs (RR=1.16,
95% CI: 1.02, 1.32). Similarly, students who attended a
school with no vending machines in a state that allowed
soda (n=969) consumed more diet soda (RR=1.40, 95%
CI: 1.00, 1.97), sports drinks (RR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.03,
1.45), energy drinks (RR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.71), and
coffee/tea (RR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.56). In contrast,
intake of SSBs was not elevated among students who
attended a school with no vending machines in a state
that banned soda (n=1046), with the exception of a

slight positive association with the number of servings of
`other SSBs' such as <100% fruit juice.
Our stratified analyses suggested that state soda laws
were associated with elevated intake of different SSBs in
different sub-groups (Table 3). Only results from the
negative binomial portion of the models are presented
because, as in Table 2, there were no differences in the
log odds of zero consumption. Notably, non-Hispanic
Blacks consumed 1.70 times as many energy drinks
(95% CI: 1.09, 2.65) and 1.49 times as many sports
drinks (95% CI: 1.16, 1.92) if they resided in a state that
banned soda in schools but had in-school access to
vending machines. Boys in this category also consumed
1.41 times as many energy drinks (95% CI: 1.04, 1.92),
whereas girls consumed 1.25 times as much coffee/tea
(95% CI: 1.06, 1.47).
Discussion
Understandably, sugar-sweetened soda has been the
principal target of school nutrition policies in the U.S.

in the past decade. Prior to the diffusion of school nutri-
tion policies, sodas had been widely available in schools
nationwide [15] and were consumed in large, unhealthy
quantities by a large proportion of adolescents in the
U.S. [2,4,5]. Policies have been very successful in remov-
ing soda from schools, as intended [11-14], but this
study raises questions of how students may be compen-
sating for such changes.
We found that students tended to consume more
sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee/tea, and other SSBs if
they resided in a state that only banned soda in schools.
These trends were most apparent where the state banned
soda at schools but students still had access to vending
machines that sold sweetened beverages. The NYPANS
measure of vending machines explicitly instructed stu-
dents to include vending machines that sold any type of
SSB, and nearly 70% of students in states with soda bans
reported having access to such vending machines at
school. Thus, it is plausible that schools in NYPANS
adhered to laws by replacing soda with other SSBs, as
other studies have reported [11,12,27]. We also found
elevated SSB intake among students whose school did
not have SSB vending machines but the state did not ban
soda at school. The inverse association between vending
machine access and SSB consumption may represent a
different causal mechanism, such as students leaving
campus if schools did not have vending machines and
state laws were not actively requiring healthier beverages
within school. We can only speculate about why these
patterns were observed; additional research is needed to
explore the mechanisms behind them.
Interestingly, SSB consumption was not elevated if both
schools and states took action to reduce SSB access ­ i.e.,
states banned soda and schools did not offer vending
machines. A recent study similarly reported that students
without vending machines consumed more soda unless
the state also banned soda in school [41]. Different
factors may explain the null results that were observed
when both schools and states restricted SSB access. One
explanation is that the comprehensive effect on policy/
environmental changes at the state and school level cre-
ated healthier environments overall (e.g., access to heal-
thier beverages). Previous research reported that the sale
of unhealthy foods/beverages in elementary schools was
often lowest when both state and local policies were
enacted [13]. Low statistical power is another possible
explanation for the null results, however, as the group
with both state soda bans and no access to vending
machines had a relatively small sample size.
Results also suggested that different sub-populations
may have substituted soda with different SSBs. Non-
Hispanic Blacks tended to consume more sports drinks
and energy drinks, in particular, when the state banned
soda; these results differ from racial/ethnic trends in
SSB intake in the U.S. overall, as reported elsewhere [5].
The increase in energy drink consumption among
Blacks is particularly concerning as health organizations
continue to speak out against the harmful effects of
energy drink consumption [19-21]. Energy drinks have
no health benefits and include several additives that are
understudied and unregulated [22]. They commonly
contain 70-80 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per 8 ounces,
more than twice the concentration in cola drinks; 20-
ounce energy drink containers include up to 325 mg of
caffeine, comparable to 3-4 cups of coffee [42].
Changes in industry marketing practices may have
contributed to the results that we observed. In the U.S.
in 2006, a coalition of food/beverage companies pledged
to market "healthier dietary choices" to children <12
years old, but recent evidence suggests that companies'
marketing of unhealthy foods has shifted toward 12-17
year-olds [43]. Advertising spending on energy drinks
alone increased from $120 million to $164 million from
2008 to 2010 [18]. Research has also shown that bever-
age companies' marketing is often targeted at Black and
Hispanic youth [18]. More research is needed to deter-
mine if changes in marketing practices have contributed
to high consumption of SSBs that were observed in this
study and in the general population [5].
These results underscore the limited scope of existing
school beverage guidelines at the high school level. In the
2009-2010 school year, when NYPANS was conducted,
14 of 50 states in the U.S. met IOM recommendations to
ban all SSBs at the elementary school level, but Connecti-
cut was the only state that met IOM recommendations
for high schools [25]. High school students are a popula-
tion whose SSB preference has shifted toward non-soda
SSBs in recent years [5]. This shift may be a direct conse-
quence of policies that targeted soda, of increased mark-
ing of other SSBs, or it may be a coincidence. Regardless,
policies need to shift accordingly to improve the overall
quality of adolescents' beverage intake and thereby
reduce the health risks that are associated with overall
sweetened beverage consumption. Policies that restrict
SSB availability should also be accompanied by initiatives
that promote low-cost alternatives such as filtered water
while recognizing that beverage choices are commonly
based on taste and price, not health [44].
As with any observational study, we cannot conclude
that laws or vending machine access were the causes of
elevated SSB intake. States may have banned soda, in
part, because of students' elevated SSB intake, which
would partially explain the associations that we observed.
We could not control for unmeasured student-level vari-
ables such as socioeconomic status (SES), either. Our
analyses of vending machines were further limited
because students were not asked which specific SSBs
were available in vending machines, nor were students
Taber et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and
Physical Activity 2015, 12(Suppl 1):S7
http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/12/S1/S7
Page 7 of 9
asked where they were consuming these beverages or
whether SSBs were available in other school venues.
Therefore, we cannot ascertain if schools were substitut-
ing soda with other SSBs or students were simply obtain-
ing SSBs elsewhere. We should also point out that,
among the three comparison groups in our analysis, the
sample size was largest for the category of students who
had access to vending machines in a state that banned
soda; statistical power was more limited in the other two
groups. NYPANS was also designed to be representative
at the national, not state, level.
Finally, we did not analyze specific measures of nutrient
intake, a topic that should be explored further in future
research. The overall impact of SSB substitution on stu-
dents' nutrient intake, weight status, and cardio-metabolic
health has not been studied extensively and is difficult to
project due to variance in serving sizes and compositional
differences between beverages and brands. The energy and
sugar content of energy drinks and fruit drinks can vary
enormously by brand and variety [45]. Sports drinks con-
tain 50-90% as much energy per ounce as soda [46], but
are commonly sold in 32-ounce containers (in contrast to
the typical 12-ounce soda can or 20-ounce soda bottle.)
Furthermore, traditional SSB measures do not fully cap-
ture beverages that are calorically sweetened after pur-
chase, but recent methods have been designed to account
for this [47]. Careful research is needed to determine how
SSB substitution behaviors translate to health outcomes
when these variables are taken into account.
Conclusions
Our study raises concerns about whether policymakers'
focus on soda may have unintended negative conse-
quences at the high school level, as laws that ban soda
were associated with higher intake of other SSBs when
vending machines were still available. We cannot prove
causality, but the elevated SSB intake suggests that state
soda bans were, at best, not addressing the beverage
consumption patterns of the adolescent populations in
these states. Adolescents' SSB preferences have shifted
in the U.S. overall, but high school SSB policies have
not followed suit even though high school is a period
when children tend to consume the most SSBs. Existing
policies may need to be expanded to restrict the sale of
all SSBs, in accordance with IOM recommendations
[23,24], and ensure that students are able to access low-
cost healthier alternatives in school. Additional longitu-
dinal research is needed to determine whether more
comprehensive SSB restrictions can reduce consumption
of all SSBs.
