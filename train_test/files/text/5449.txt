Abstract
Objective: To assess clinical characteristics and cytokine levels in children with severe pneumonia
who required ventilatory support.
Methods: In this prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study, blood and endotracheal fluid
samples were obtained from patients with severe pneumonia, aged <5 years, within 24 h following
intubation. Blood samples were also obtained from age-matched healthy controls. Cytokine levels
were investigated using flow cytometry-assisted immunoassay.
Results: Forty-five patients with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (aged 10 Æ 5
months) and 35 healthy age-matched controls were included. Patients with severe pneumonia had
significantly increased serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-
stimulating factor concentrations compared with controls (80.84 pg/ml versus 2.06 pg/ml,
90.03 pg/ml versus 6.62 pg/ml, and 115.58 pg/ml versus 11.47 pg/ml, respectively). In the severe
pneumonia group, serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher in patients aged <6 months versus
those aged 6­12 months. Age-group differences in serum cytokine levels did not correspond to
age-group differences in endotracheal-fluid cytokine levels. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly
higher in patients who subsequently died versus those who survived (267.12 pg/ml versus 20.75 pg/
ml, respectively).
Conclusion: High IL-6 concentrations were associated with mortality in patients <5 years of age
with severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.

Introduction
Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of
death in children, particularly in those under
5 years of age,1 and can be caused by
different types of agents, such as bacteria,
viruses, exposure to toxic substances, pollu-
tants, irritants, and allergens.2 Under
normal circumstances, microorganisms do
not penetrate into the alveoli, due to pro-
tective mechanisms and the anatomy of the
bronchioles and alveoli. When microorgan-
isms do enter the bronchioles and alveoli,
inflammation occurs, and many cells are
activated to release cytokines and mediators
to launch and maintain the inflammatory
response.2 A balance between inflammatory
response and anti-inflammatory processes is
necessary to maintain lung homeostasis.
Macrophage cells transit into the lungs
from the pulmonary capillaries and reside in
the respiratory tract, alveoli and interstitial
space around the alveoli. Macrophages play
a role in regulating the acute and chronic
inflammatory response, and although they
can proliferate in the lungs, their numbers
are often not high enough to fight infec-
tion.3,4 Macrophages have phagocytic
ability and are a source of cytokines,
chemokines, and other inflammatory medi-
ators.5,6 Other cell types including neutro-
phils, lymphocytes, epithelial cells and mast
cells also participate in inflammation, pro-
ducing cytokines and helping to modulate
the inflammatory response.2
An imbalance in the two types of
cytokines, proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory, may influence the prognosis
of sepsis and other infectious and inflam-
matory diseases.7,8 The proinflammatory
cytokines include tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8,
and interferon (IFN)-g, all of which
activate the immune system and participate
in the acute inflammatory response.
The anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-a
and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) play a
major role in regulating the activities of cells
and other cytokines.9 Alveolar macrophages
secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines to
reduce inflammation in the lungs,10,11 for
example, TGF-a receptor is present on most
cells and TGF is known to promote wound
healing and fibrosis.10 Proinflammatory
cytokines encourage transition of T helper
(Th) type 0 cells towards Th1, which can
further amplify the inflammatory cascade by
secretion of INF-g, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-12, and
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulat-
ing factor (GM-CSF).12­14 In turn, IL-10
inhibits the production of proinflammatory
cytokines by T cells, natural killer cells, and
monocytes, thus reducing inflammation.12
Dysregulation of cytokines and the cells that
procure them may predispose to severe
pneumonia.13,14
Macrophages alone may not be able to
contain and destroy bacteria during infec-
tion, and require the influx of polymorpho-
nuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to assist in
containment.15 Cytokines, such as TNF-a,
IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, are secreted by alveo-
lar macrophages and act as chemotactic
agents for PMNs, enhancing the phagocytic
activity occurring in the lungs. Over pro-
duction of these cytokines, however, can
be destructive, damaging normal lung
structure, and increase morbidity and
mortality.15
Several life-threatening bacterial lung
diseases are demonstrated to be caused by
excessive neutrophil-mediated inflammatory
signals, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6; IL-8
and other components.16 In a study of 201
hospitalized patients with pneumonia, blood
levels of cytokines such as IL-1RA, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10 were shown to increase in the
acute phase, and rapidly decrease when
patients were discharged from hospital.17
1806 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
In bacterial pneumonia the cytokine
response is mostly confined to the affected
lung,18­21 but systemic concentrations of
cytokines are also increased.18,19,22 Higher
concentrations of cytokines in blood are
reflected by, and have been shown to pre-
dict, the severity of pneumonia.19,23,24
Prior studies of infectious diseases have
mainly focused on the systemic inflamma-
tory response, investigating markers such as
the number of white blood cells, the number
of neutrophils, and C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels, that also demonstrate the
severity of inflammation.25 Studying cyto-
kine transition in patients with severe pneu-
monia may help in determining prognostic
factors of disease severity and outcomes,
and may help to determine interventions. In
Vietnam, minimal data are available on
peripheral blood and endotracheal fluid
cytokine levels in children with pneumonia
who are intubated. Thus, the objective of the
present research was to study clinical char-
acteristics and cytokine levels in young
patients with severe pneumonia requiring
mechanical ventilation compared with
healthy age-matched controls, in order to
determine if cytokine levels were associated
with outcome in paediatric cases of severe
pneumonia.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional
study sequentially enrolled patients <5 years
of age, who were admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit, National Hospital of Paediatrics,
Hanoi, Vietnam diagnosed with severe
pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring
mechanical respiratory support, and healthy
age-matched controls who received routine
care also at the National Hospital of
Paediatrics, between February 2014 and
August 2014. Inclusion criteria comprised:
severe pneumonia requiring mechanical
respiratory support; endotracheal
intubation within 24 h following hospital
admission; aged between 1 month and
5 years; and legal proxy consent to partici-
pate in the study. Exclusion criteria com-
prised: severe pneumonia with other chronic
diseases, such as congenital heart disease,
encephalitis, stroke, and chronic lung dis-
eases; or endotracheal intubation conducted
>24 h following hospital admission.
Pneumonia was diagnosed according to
clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory
tests:26 Fever or low temperature, a dry
cough or cough with phlegm, fast breathing,
chest indrawing, crackles upon auscultation
of both lungs, and chest X-ray with typical
findings consistent with pneumonia.
Severe pneumonia was diagnosed based
on signs and symptoms of pneumonia, chest
indrawing, respiratory failure without cyan-
osis, SpO2
<95%, PaO2
<60 mmHg, and
normal or slightly decreased PaCO2
.26
Seriously severe pneumonia was diag-
nosed based on signs and symptoms of
pneumonia, respiratory failure with cyan-
osis of varying degrees, respiratory rate
(slow or fast breathing, episodes of apnea,
and with chest indrawing), SpO2
<95%,
PaO2
<60 mmHg, and increased PaCO2
>50 mmHg.26
This study was approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee of the National Hospital
of Paediatrics, Hanoi, Vietnam (No. 954B/
BV.NTW- VNCSKTE), and written informed
consent was obtained from the legal proxies of
all study participants.
Data and sample collection
Relevant data for the present study were
gathered from the patient's hospital data-
base records, and a complete history and
exam was obtained for all participants.
Venous blood samples (2 ml) were drawn
into tubes without anticoagulant from
patients meeting the inclusion criteria
within the first 24 h following endotracheal
intubation, and from control participants.
Nguyen Thi Dieu et al. 1807
Immediately following collection and trans-
fer to the processing laboratory, blood
samples were placed at 37C for 30 min to
allow clotting. Samples were then centri-
fuged at 1 000 g for 5 min at 4C. The
subsequent fibrin plug was removed with
glass chopsticks followed by further sample
centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4C.
Endotracheal fluid samples (2 ml) were col-
lected by aspiration via catheter following
injection of 5 ml sterile 0.9% NaCl into the
endotracheal tube from patients meeting the
inclusion criteria within the first 24 h follow-
ing intubation. Serum and endotracheal
fluid samples were stored at ­80C prior to
analysis.
Quantification of peripheral blood and
endotracheal fluid cytokine levels
Serum and endotracheal fluid cytokine
quantification was performed at the
Immunology Laboratory of Military
Medical Academy 103, Hanoi, Vietnam,
via flow cytometry-assisted immunoassay
using the Bio-PlexÕ system of reagents
and equipment (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
First, 96-well assay plates were pre-
wetted by adding 100 ml of assay buffer
(Bio-Plex ProTM; Bio-Rad) and removing
the liquid using vacuum filtration. Magnetic
bead sets coloured with two fluorescent dyes
(red and infrared) at distinct ratios, and
conjugated to capture monoclonal antibo-
dies specific to target cytokine epitopes
(Bio-PlexÕ, Bio-Rad), were diluted to a
1 Â working suspension, vortexed for 30 s
at medium speed, then 50 ml was transferred
to each well of the assay plate. The plate was
washed twice with 100 ml of wash buffer
using a Bio-Plex ProTM Wash Station with
the MAG Â 2 programme setting (Bio-Rad).
Diluted standards, blanks, samples, and
controls were gently vortexed for 5 s, and
50 ml was transferred to each well of the
assay plate, which was then covered with
sealing tape, protected from light with alu-
minium foil and incubated on shaker at
room temperature. Following incubation,
the sealing tape was slowly removed and
discarded, and the plate washed three times
with 100 ml of wash buffer as before.
Secondary biotinylated monoclonal detec-
tion antibodies, specific to a different epi-
tope on the target cytokines (1 Â dilution;
Bio-PlexÕ human cytokines; Bio-Rad), were
gently vortexed for 5 s, poured into a reagent
reservoir, and 25 ml was then transferred to
each well. Plates were covered with new
sealing tape, protected from light with alu-
minium foil, and incubated on a shaker for
30 min at room temperature before washing
three times with 100 ml of wash buffer.
Finally, 50 ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin
(SA-PE) reporter conjugate (diluted 1 Â)
was vortexed and transferred to each well,
and the covered plate incubated at room
temperature to form streptavidin-biotin
complexes. Following the streptavidin-
phycoerythrin incubation step, the plate
was washed three times with 100 ml of wash
buffer, then 125 ml of assay buffer (Bio-Plex
ProTM; Bio-Rad) was added to each well,
and the covered plate incubated on a shaker
for 30 s at room temperature. The plate was
ready to read following removal of the
sealing tape. The identity and quantity of
the cytokines was assessed using a flow
cytometry/laser excitation­based Bio-Plex
200 system (Bio-Rad) with two different
sources of laser (532­635 nm) and detectors
to generate and record two types of inde-
pendent fluorescent signal emitted by the
beads (qualitative signals) and from the
specific reaction emitted by the particle
surface (quantitative signals).
Based on the density of the fluorescence
emitted from the particles incubated with
known concentrations of cytokines, the
target cytokines were quantified. The
normal range of studied cytokines with
age-matched values for healthy subjects

Academy 103 Immunology Laboratory
were: IL-6, 1.73­9.26 pg/ml; IL-8, 2.32­
9.58 pg/ml; IL-10, 0.52­5.56 pg/ml; IL-12,
0.01­1.05 pg/ml; GM-CSF, 7.64­19.34 pg/
ml; INF-g, 5.54­98.2 pg/ml; and TNF-a,
1.94­3.76 pg/ml.
Statistical analyses
The recorded parameters were analysed
using IBM-SPSS software, version 20.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Values are
presented as mean Æ SD or median (min­
max) for quantitative variables, and n (%)
prevalence for qualitative variables.
Normally distributed quantitative param-
eters were compared using analysis of
variance, or by non-parametric methods
(Mann­Whitney U-test and Kruskal­
Wallis test) if not normally distributed.
Z-test was used for proportion comparisons.
A P value < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
A total of 45 patients with severe pneumonia
and respiratory failure requiring ventilatory
support (mean age, 10 Æ 5 months; range,
2­31 months) and 35 healthy age-matched
controls (mean age, 13 Æ 4 months; range,
2­36 months) were included in the present
study. There were no statistically significant
differences between the patient group
and age-matched controls, and demographic
and clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 1.
Serum IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF levels
were significantly higher in patients with
severe pneumonia on mechanical support
than in healthy age-matched controls
(P < 0.001). There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences in serum concentrations
of IL-10, IL-12, TNF-a and INF-g between
patients with pneumonia and healthy age-
matched controls (Table 2 and Figure 1).
Serum cytokine levels in patients with
severe pneumonia classified by age are pre-
sented in Figure 2 and Table 3. Serum IL-10
levels in patients with severe pneumonia
aged <6 months were significantly higher
than those aged 6­12 months (P < 0.05).
There were no statistically significant
differences in other serum cytokine

Serum and endotracheal fluid cytokine
levels were compared in patients with severe
pneumonia requiring mechanical ventila-
tion, and showed that levels of TNF-a,
IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly higher in
endotracheal fluid than in blood serum
(P < 0.01; Table 3). In contrast, levels of
IL-10 and INF-g were significantly higher in
serum than in endotracheal fluid (P < 0.01;
Table 3). There were no statistically signifi-
cant differences in GM-CSF and IL-12 levels
between serum and endotracheal fluid.
Serum cytokine levels were compared
between patients with severe pneumonia
who survived and patients who died.
Serum IL-6 levels obtained within 24 h of
endotracheal intubation and mechanical
ventilation were significantly higher in
patients who subsequently died versus
those who survived (267.12 pg/ml versus
20.75 pg/ml; respectively; P < 0.05; Table 4).
Discussion
The present study focused on cytokine con-
centrations in peripheral blood from
patients <5 years of age, with severe pneu-
monia requiring ventilatory support, com-
pared with healthy age-matched controls.
Cytokine levels in endotracheal fluid from
the patients with severe pneumonia were
also investigated.
Fever is a host self-defence mechanism
against pathogens during infection, stimu-
lated by IL-1, IL- 6 and TNF, and is a
common symptom of pneumonia.27
Although all patients in the present study
had severe pneumonia, only 62% of patients
were found to have fever, which may be

explained by the fact that the patients had
been previously treated with antibiotics, and
also because malnutrition, seen in 53% of
patients, may have blunted the immune
response and led to atypical clinical signs
of infection.28,29 Malnutrition is the leading
risk factor for death in children with pneu-
monia, particularly in infants under 1 year
of age.30,31
The present results showed that serum
IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF concentrations
were significantly higher in patients with
severe pneumonia than in age-matched
healthy controls (Table 2 and Figure 1).
Cytokines are soluble proteins of low
molecular weight, that function as signalling
molecules between cells. The immune
response in patients with pneumonia
varies, depending on cause and severity of
the disease, but the most important physio-
logical reaction is the release of various
cytokines by inflammatory cells, to magnify
the inflammatory reaction in the lungs.8 The
inflammatory response depends on the types
and concentrations of cytokines produced,
and research into the inflammatory response
in pneumonia has shown an imbalance
between proinflammatory and anti-inflam-
matory factors, which is often related to
mortality in children.17 Cytokines, such as
GM-CSF and IL-8, are known to cause an
increase in the inflammatory response and
influx of neutrophils into the airways.
During the same time, there is a transition
from Th0 lymphocytes to Th1 and Th17,
both of which further enhance inflammation
and the influx of other infammatory cells.
The cytokines produced by Th1 cells include
TNF-a, INF-g, and IL-6. Th-2 cytokines are
key players in the development of allergic
disease, while Th17 cells cause a neutrophil
response, and are associated with IL-17,
IL-21, IL-22, and IL-26.17,32,33 The patients
in the present study showed increased IL-6,
IL-8 and GM-CSF levels, as expected for an
acute bacterial pneumonia. Levels of IL-10,
which downregulate inflammation,34 were
not significantly elevated in the present
patients, and reflected the lack of down-
regulation of the immune response. In
addition, IL-12, TNF-a, and INF-g are
more commonly elevated in response to
Table 4. Serum cytokine levels obtained within 24 h of endotracheal intubation in patients <5
years of age with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation who

and a more pure Th1 response, and for this
reason were not expected to be elevated.
Published research suggests that cyto-
kines are time-dependent following the
initiation of infection. TNF-a and IL-6
normally act as proinflammatory cytokines,
with the early response cytokine, TNF-a,
appearing early in patients with pneumo-
nia.36 During acute respiratory distress syn-
drome (ARDS), proinflammatory cytokines
increase quickly,37 for example, in bronch-
oalveolar lavage samples from patients with
early stage ARDS, the concentration of
TNF-a is increased.20 The present study
failed to demonstrate an increase in TNF-a
and IFN-g, possibly because the latter is
more important in viral and intracellular
organism infections,38 and the present
patient population differed from those
expected to have viral infections. Most
importantly, the present findings suggest
an association between significantly elevated
serum IL-6 levels and mortality. Other pub-
lished studies have shown that the severity of
pneumonia is reflected by levels and types of
cytokines in the blood.18
In a prospective study of 1886 patients
admitted to the emergency department for
pneumonia,19 in which blood concentrations
of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured
daily during the first week of pneumonia,
concentrations of all cytokines were shown
to be increased in 82% of patients. Cytokine
concentrations were highest at hospital
admission and decreased quickly following
the first day, but remained high in the first
week. High concentrations of IL-6 and
IL-10 reflected serious disease and a higher
risk of mortality.19 In patients with pneu-
monia in the early days and the 30th day of
the disease,17 IL-6 concentrations were
found to be increased by 1 695%, CRP
increased by 1 088%, IL-10 increased by
332%, and IL-8 increased by 96%. In
addition, the concentration of IL-12
increased by 6%, and IFN-g by 6%, in the
acute phase,17 which was similar to the
present data in patients with severe pneu-
monia versus healthy age-matched controls.
The present results showed that, compared
with healthy controls, IL-6 concentration
increased 39 fold (80.84 pg/ml versus
2.06 pg/ml), IL-8 concentration increased
14 fold (90.03 pg/ml versus 6.62 pg/ml), and
GM-CSF concentration increased 10 fold
(115.58 pg/ml versus 11.47 pg/ml).
In a study of bronchoalveolar lavage
from 74 patients with pneumonia on mech-
anical ventilation and 17 control patients
without pneumonia on ventilators,20 con-
centrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were signifi-
cantly increased compared with controls,
while TNF-a was not elevated. In a further
study of 31 patients with pneumonia aged 13
years, and 6 healthy age-matched controls,23
bronchoalveolar lavage IL-8 concentration
was significantly increased in patients with
pneumonia versus controls, and there was
no correlation between bronchoalveolar
lavage IL-8 concentration and polymorpho-
nuclear leukocyte quantities. IL-8 is a cyto-
kine produced by macrophages and
epithelial cells, amongst other cell types,
and airway smooth muscle cells and endo-
thelial cells are the first to secrete IL-8 to
attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the
inflammatory area.39 Similar to other stu-
dies, in which blood IL-8 concentration was
shown to be increased in children with
pneumonia,40 and the concentration of
IL-6 and IL-8 was shown to be increased
in the first 48 hours of pneumonia,18 the
present results showed that IL-8 concentra-
tion was highly increased in the blood serum
of very young children with pneumonia
under 5 years of age, compared with healthy
age-matched children. These results demon-
strate that even in early life, increases in pro-
inflammatory cytokines are detected in
response to infection.
In the present study, serum TNF-a levels
were not increased within 24 h of intubation,
but levels in bronchoalveolar lavage were
1814 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
high compared with serum. These data
suggest that the inflammatory response
occurs in the airways early, before the
systemic reaction. TNF-a concentration
was shown to be increased in the alveolar
and lung parenchyma of mice following
stimulation with different respiratory aller-
gens.21 Inhibition of TNF-a reduces neutro-
phil concentration in the lungs, and the
process of destroying bacteria, resulting in
rapid increase in the severity of disease, and
mortality rate was shown to increase from
10% in healthy mice to 80% in mice
with complete inhibition of TNF-a follow-
ing injection of 102 units of Klebsiella
pneumoniae.21
A published study in children with pneu-
monia15 showed that blood IL-6 concentra-
tion in children with pneumonia on
mechanical ventilation who survived was
464 pg/ml, compared with 1209 pg/ml in
children with pneumonia who did not sur-
vive. In this study,15 IL-6 and TNF-a con-
centration in endotracheal fluids was high,
corresponding to the scale of lung injury,
and blood IL-6 concentration was con-
sidered to be a prognostic factor for mor-
tality in children. Similarly, the present
study found that serum IL-6 concentrations
were high in patients with pneumonia who
did not survive versus patients who survived
(267.12 pg/ml versus 20.75 pg/ml, respect-
ively), suggesting an association between
high blood IL-6 concentration and mortal-
ity. Analyses of serum cytokine concentra-
tions between three age groups in the
present study revealed statistically signifi-
cant differences in IL-10 levels only.
Endotracheal fluid concentrations of IL-6,
IL-8 and TNF-a, however, were signifi-
cantly higher in patients aged 6­12 months
than in patients aged under 6 months or over
12 months, and IFN-g was significantly
higher in patients aged 6­12 months and
>12 months versus those aged <6 months.
In conclusion, cytokines such as IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, and GM-CSF appear to play an
important role in acute inflammation in
young patients, under 5 years of age, with
severe pneumonia. The inflammatory
response was shown to occur at the infection
site (in the lungs) and systemically (in blood
serum). High IL-6 concentration was asso-
ciated with mortality.
