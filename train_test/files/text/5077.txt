Abstract
Numerous studies have examined the association between pharmacogenetic effects and the
response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with asthma. In fact, several single nucleotide
polymorphisms of a number of candidate genes have been identified that might influence the clinical
response to ICS in children with asthma. Their direct or indirect effects depend on their role in the
inflammatory process in asthma or the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids, respectively.
Among the genes identified, variants in T-box 21 (TBX21) and Fc fragment of IgE receptor II
(FCER2) contribute indirectly to the variability in the response to ICS by altering the inflammatory
mechanisms in asthma, while other genes such as corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1
(CRHR1), nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1), stress induced phosphopro-
tein 1 (STIP1), dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), glucocorticoid induced 1 (GLCCI1), histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC), ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3), and vascular
endothelial growth factors (VEGF) directly affect this variability through the anti-inflammatory
mechanisms of ICS. The results to date indicate various potential genetic factors associated with
the response to ICS, which could be utilized to predict the individual therapeutic response of
children with asthma to ICS. Clinical trials are underway and their results are greatly anticipated.
Further pharmacogenetic studies are needed to fully understand the effects of genetic variation on
the response to ICS in children with asthma.

Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disease in
children, which makes them absent from
school and sometimes requires emergency
hospitalization. About 50% of patients with
asthma have the initial symptoms from
childhood.1 One of the key pathogenic
characteristics of asthmatic children is
chronic inflammation in the airways. Anti-
inflammatory drugs are therefore the usual
treatment of choice and they are recom-
mended by many international asthma man-
agement guidelines.2 Children with asthma
are recommended to use inhaled corticoster-
oids (ICS), bronchodilators (short- or long-
acting beta-agonists), antileukotrienes, or
anticholinergics for those more than 12
years old;2 and immunotherapy is recom-
mended in some severe cases.3 To date,
corticosteroids are known to be one of the
most effective ways to treat inflammation for
children with persistent asthma and for
preventing airway remodelling.4 However,
there is evidence that some asthmatic chil-
dren do not respond when using ICS.5
Previous studies have suggested that
60­80% of asthma patients have different
responses due to genetic factors.6 The results
from pharmacogenetic studies have demon-
strated the correlation between candidate
genes and drug responses, for example
adrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB2), corticotropin
releasing hormone receptor 2, and arginase 1
encoding for different responses to beta-2
agonists; arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, leu-
kotriene A4 hydrolase, leukotriene C4 syn-
thase, and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2
for affecting the response to leukotriene
antagonists; and corticotropin releasing hor-
mone receptor 1 (CRHR1), T-box 21
(TBX21), and Fc fragment of IgE receptor
II (FCER2) for response to ICS.5,7­9 This
review summarizes the results of studies on
genetic factors in the modulating corti-
cotherapy effects in children with asthma.
Overview of airway inflammation
in asthmatic children
Asthmatic children are particularly recog-
nized by inflammation in the airway, bron-
chial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and
reversibility of airway obstruction.10 Many
inflammatory and structural cells and
inflammatory mediators are involved in the
disease processes in asthmatic children.11
Negative impacts on the airways caused by
pathogens induce structural changes of the
airways or remodeling.12 These changes are
responsible for the persistent clinical symp-
toms such as a chronic refractory cough and
dyspnoea. It is also a common cause for
bronchoconstriction and severe dyspnoea
during and after exercise.
Mechanism of airway inflammation
in asthmatic children
In children with asthma, the inflammation is
initiated by infiltration of allergens into the
lower airway, which are taken up by den-
dritic cells (DC).13 DC process allergens to
peptides and present the peptides to nai¨ve T
cells, and in a suitable environment the nai¨ve
T cells develop into type 2 helper T (Th
2)
cells.11 Th
2 cells produce cytokines such as
interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, stimulating B
lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin
(Ig)E; IL-3 and IL-5, attracting eosinophils
to the lungs; and IL-4 and IL-9, which
stimulate mast cell hyperplasia.14 Under
the influence of Th
2 cells, B lymphocytes
secrete IgE, which is a key factor in allergic
Duong-Thi-Ly et al. 1819
asthma because it activates mast cells
(Figure 1). With exposure to the specific
allergens that individuals are sensitized to,
mast cells, secondary to binding of allergens
to IgE, release histamine and start to
produce prostaglandin D2 and cysteinyl-
leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4),
which attract inflammatory cells to the
lungs.11 The early phase of asthma is sec-
ondary to the effects of histamine and other
mediators released from mast cells, while the
delayed effect is secondary to other inflam-
matory cells and the release of mediators.
Molecular mechanism of inflammation
in asthmatic children
As in adults, the molecular mechanism of
inflammation in asthmatic children is char-
acterized by increasing various inflamma-
tory genes controlled by proinflammatory
transcription factors, such as nuclear
factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1
(AP1).15 Both NF-kB and AP1 are activated
by mediators, including cytokines, tumour
necrosis factor-a, IL-1b, and other factors
(Figure 2).14 There are many coactivators
that also participate in the activation and
repression of inflammatory genes through
acetylating the core histones.4 As a result,
inflammatory proteins or enzymes and other
proteins are synthesized and their produc-
tion can influence inflammation in asthma.16
Anti-inflammatory mechanisms
of corticosteroids
Corticosteroids are synthesized and secreted
by the cortex of the adrenal gland as a result
of stimulation by the hypothalamus­pituit-
ary­adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is
responsible for the adaptation to stress and
inflammatory stimuli. This response is char-
acterized by a hypothalamic release of

corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH),
which is important in regulating the
secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) and consequently in the catechola-
minergic response to CRH. Hypothalamic
CRH acts by combining with the CRH
receptor (CRHR), predominantly CRH
receptor 1 (CRHR1) (Figure 3). When
CRH combines with CRHR1 on the anter-
ior pituitary gland, ACTH is released and
then binds to melanocortin 2 receptors on
the adrenal cortex to stimulate cortisol
secretion.17
Both endogenous and exogenous cortico-
steroids act effectively by combining with a
cytoplasmic receptor known as the gluco-
corticoid receptor (GR). Two isoforms of
the GR exist, GRa and GRb, of which only
GRa can bind ligand.18 GRs are expressed
in most types of cells with different modular
structures.19 A protein complex including
heat shock protein (HSP)70 and HSP90
binds the inactive GR. While HSP70 inacti-
vates GR through partial unfolding, HSP90
reverses this inactivation, and is required for
activation of the GR. The nuclear localiza-
tion of the activated GR­steroid complex
takes place when the ligand combines with
GR-HSP90 complexes. GR homodimers
bind to glucocorticoid response elements
(GREs) in the promoter region of steroid-
sensitive genes, by which the anti-inflamma-
tory proteins, such as annexin-1, secretary
leucocyte protease inhibitor, MAPK
phosphatase-1 (MKP-1/DUSP1/MAPK1),4
NF-kB, inhibitor of kappa B alpha, IL-10
and glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper
can be encoded.19 Less frequently, GR
homodimers prevent genes from being
encoded by combining with negative
GREs, especially those relating to cortico-
steroid side-effects.4 Proinflammatory
transcription factors like NF-kB or
AP1 activate coactivator molecules, like

Pharmacogenetic response to
inhaled corticosteroids in the
treatment of asthmatic children
Inhaled corticosteroids are one of the most
effective anti-inflammatory medications for
asthma and they are the first-line treatment
of choice for persistent asthma in children.20
However, 5­15% of asthmatic children fail
to respond to ICS and they are often treated
with high doses of ICS, which then has
the potential to cause significant side-
effects.19,21 Although ICS non-responsive
patients are uncommon, their treatment is
associated with clinical challenges because
alternative treatment choices are limited and
the cost of treating this small population of
patients accounts for more than 50% of all

asthma cases.19 Gene polymorphisms are
one of the causes for the inter-individual
variability in a patient's response to medi-
cation. With regard to the response to ICS,
the genetic factors in question may be
categorized into three groups: (i) the proin-
flammatory mechanisms of asthma; (ii) the
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of cortico-
steroids; and (iii) a group with unclear
mechanisms.
Genetic factors and inflammation
in asthma
The TBX21 gene
The transcription factor T-bet (also known
as T-box 21 or Tbx21 protein) encoded by
the TBX21 gene acts as a type 1 helper T cell
development regulator by inducing inter-
feron-g production and inhibiting Th
2 cyto-
kines (Figure 1).22 Previous research has
shown that knockout mice lacking T-bet
developed BHR and other changes consist-
ent with asthma, including peribronchial
inflammation and collagen deposited in the
basement membrane.23 ICS also modify
BHR in asthma patients and it's efficacy
might be altered by TBX21 mutation.22
A correlation between the single nucleo-
tide polymorphism (SNP) rs9910408
(c.-7947) in the TBX21 gene with BHR was
reported in children,23 which was also seen
in another study in adults.22 Changes in
TBX21 expression in asthmatic children
was previously demonstrated, in which the
minor G allele in the TBX21 SNP rs2240017,
which codes for glutamine (33Q), was
associated with a dramatic improvement in
the PC(20) (a measure of airway responsive-
ness) in the ICS-treated group (Table 1).24
However, this was not replicated in a study
that genotyped four genes (ADRB2, adenyl-
ate cyclase 9, neurokinin receptor 2, and
TBX21) in 53 adult Korean patients with
mild-to-moderate asthma; after 4 weeks of
treatment with ICS, there was a correlation
between the control of asthma and the high
frequency of the major C allele in TBX21
H33Q C>G.25
The FCER2 gene
The Fc fragment of IgE receptor II (FCER2)
gene, which encodes the low-affinity recep-
tor for IgE (CD23),26 decreases IgE-
mediated immune responses when activated
(Figure 1).27 In patients with asthma, high
IgE levels cause acute exacerbations,28 emer-
gency consultations,29,30 and hospitaliza-
tions (Table 1).31,32 A novel variant
(T2206C) of the FCER2 gene was shown
to be associated with higher IgE levels and
increased severe exacerbations in children
with asthma treated with ICS (Table 1).26
A study that aimed to identify predictors of
a poor response to ICS during long-term
therapy, evaluated 17 phenotypic variables
and polymorphisms of the FCER2 and
CRHR1 genes in 311 asthmatic children
treated with budesonide during the
Childhood Asthma Management Program
(CAMP) clinical trial by comparing recur-
rent exacerbations and lung function.33 The
results showed that both a poor lung func-
tion response and repeated exacerbations
were caused only by the FCER2 gene muta-
tion.33 Children that were homozygous for
the FCER2 gene T2206C mutant allele had a
3.3-times higher risk of recurrent exacerba-
tions and a 3.9-times higher risk of poor
lung function than the wild-type homozy-
gous children (Table 1).33
Data from two cohort studies undertaken
in the Netherlands, which included 386
children in the Pharmacogenetics of Asthma
medication in Children: Medication with
ANti-inflammatory effects study and 939
children in the BREATHE study, were used
to analyse the effect of the FCER2 gene
T2206C variant on acute asthma exacerba-
tions, symptoms and treatment.34 The results
showed that the T2206C variant was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of asthma-related

2.64, 95% CI 1.00, 6.98), and a higher daily
steroid dose (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.38, 4.39).34
The CRHR1 gene
Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1,
encoded by the CRHR1 gene, is one of the
key receptors of the pituitary gland and it
plays an intermediary role in releasing
ACTH (Figure 3). CRHR1 has been
shown to be important in the pathogenesis
of asthma in children and adults.35 The
absence of CRHR1 leads to enhanced
airway inflammation and dysfunction.36 A
study that evaluated 14 candidate genes that
are relevant to the entire corticosteroid
pathway demonstrated that the rs242941
polymorphism of the CRHR1 gene was
associated with a positive treatment
response in both children from the CAMP
clinical trial and a population of adults
with asthma (known as the Adult Study)
(Table 1).37 However, this result was not
replicated in adults with asthma from the
Asthma Clinical Research Network popula-
tion who were also evaluated in this study.37
The NR3C1 gene
The nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C
member 1 (NR3C1) gene encodes the gluco-
corticoid receptor, which acts as a transcrip-
tion factor that binds to the promoter area
of the glucocorticoid responsive genes
(Figure 3).38 Mutations in this gene are
associated with generalized glucocorticoid
resistance.39

take part in the regulation of the cortico-
steroid response of severely asthmatic
patients with lung dysfunction.41 Four
STIP1 gene SNPs (rs4980524, rs6591838,
rs2236647, and rs2236648) were closely
associated with a decrease in the baseline
percentage predicted forced expiratory
volume in 1 s (FEV1
) and the largest differ-
ence was measured for SNP rs6591838.41
The rare GG genotype of rs6591838
increased the percentage change in FEV1
at
both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.41
The GLCCI1 gene
Corticosteroids induce the expression of the
glucocorticoid induced 1 (GLCCI1) gene.7
GLCCI1 gene polymorphisms are associated
with a decreased ICS response in asthmatic
patients.7 In the CAMP clinical trial, the
minor (T) rs37972 allele was demonstrated
to be significantly associated with a poor
response to ICS (Table 1).7
The HDAC genes
Members of the histone deacetylase
(HDAC) family of enzymes are involved in
regulating the inflammatory genes by
removing acetyl groups from histones
(Figure 3).42,43 Conditional gene targeting
that resulted in the T cell-specific loss of
HDAC1 lead to an inflamed airway and Th
2
cytokine production in an in vivo allergic
airway inflammation model in mice.44 In
addition, HDAC is related to the cortico-
steroid activity mechanism.45 For example,
HDAC2 recruitment is an important step in
the process by which corticosteroids repress
inflammatory genes; and HDAC2 is less
active in some diseases where a proportion
of patients respond poorly to corticoster-
oids.46 Therefore, HDAC1 and HDAC2 can
be studied as target mediators for corticos-
teroid-response prediction.47
A study on 70 children and 35 adults with
asthma showed that there was a significant
correlation between the rs1741981 poly-
morphism in the HDAC1 gene and asthma
severity, while the rs58677352 polymorph-
ism in the HDAC2 gene showed no correl-
ation with asthma severity.47 Children with
the rs1741981 CC genotype had the lower
increase of percentage FEV1
in response to
corticosteroid therapy in comparison with
children with the CT and TT genotypes.47
The ORMDL3 gene
The ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis
regulator 3 (ORMDL3) gene at locus
17q21 is ubiquitously expressed and encodes
a protein that is a crucial mediator in
decreasing the synthesis of sphingolipids.48
In asthma, sphingolipids play an important
role in synthesizing many inflammatory
proteins (Figure 3).49 The ORMDL3 gene
increases the risk of asthma in children.50
The SNP rs2872507 that modulates
ORMDL3 gene expression has been shown
to have a significant correlation with
asthma.51,52 In a study of 311 children with
persistent asthma and 276 healthy control
subjects, the rs2872507 polymorphism was
demonstrated to be associated with
ORMDL3 gene expression and with ICS
treatment response in children with atopic
asthma.53
The VEGF genes
Members of the family of vascular endothe-
lial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate angio-
genesis and vascular permeability.54 In
mouse models, VEGF (now known as
VEGF-A) has been observed to increase
mucus production, collagen deposition, as
well as smooth muscle hyperplasia.55
Empirical evidence suggested that increased
VEGF levels were inversely correlated with
FEV1
and positively associated with airway
hyperresponsiveness.56 However, there is a
lack of evidence about the effects of the
VEGF genes on medication responsiveness.
1826 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
A study that investigated the effects of the
VEGFA gene in 131 asthmatic children
being treated with different therapies (the
ICS fluticasone propionate or the leuko-
triene receptor antagonist [LTRA] montelu-
kast) for 12 months, demonstrated that the
polymorphism rs2146323 A>C was asso-
ciated with ICS response.57 Specifically,
patients with the AA genotype had a greater
improvement in FEV1
when compared with
those with the AC and CC genotypes.57
However, among children treated with the
LTRA, the AA genotype was associated
with uncontrolled asthma and a worse
FEV1
/forced vital capacity ratio compared
with the other genotypes.57 Another poly-
morphism associated with the LTRA
response was rs833058 C>T, in which
patients with the TT genotype had an
improvement in the percentage predicted
FEV1
in comparison with no improvement
in patients with the CT or CC genotypes.57
Other genes
The role of other genes such as dual speci-
ficity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) or allantoi-
case (ALLC) in response to corticosteroids
in children with asthma has not been well
demonstrated.58,59 DUSP1 protein (also
known as mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphatase-1) is important in the human
cellular response to stress caused by the
environment and to cell proliferation.60 In
asthmatic patients, DUSP1 seems to medi-
ate corticosteroid activity (Figure 3).58 The
ALLC gene, an uricolysis enzyme involved
in uric acid degradation, has an unclear role
in ICS response in asthmatic patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, despite the use of ICS and
other therapies, childhood asthma
causes significant morbidity worldwide.
Understanding the pathogenesis of asthma
and the impact of genetic polymorphisms on
the ICS treatment response could lead to
personalized therapy and improved quality
of care for children with asthma in the
future.
