Background
Lung cancer (LC) is diagnosed in more than 221 000
patients in the United States annually.1 Medical advances
have improved survival for LC, but because of disease bur-
den, preexisting illness, and the toxicities of therapy,
patients with LC have a significant respiratory symptom
burden.2,3 Dyspnea is present in up to 87% of patients with
LC and has a profound impact on quality of life and sur-
vival.4-8 The existing literature is sparse on interventions to
improve dyspnea for patients with LC.9 Physicians also
appear to treat the dyspnea associated with LC less aggres-
sively than they do dyspnea associated with chronic lung
disease.10 Effective interventions for dyspnea are a clear
area of need for patients with LC.
Acupuncture is a component of a 2500-year-old Eastern
medical system and is used by more than 2 million adults
annually in the United States. Multiple studies have shown
acupuncture to be safe when administered by trained practi-
tioners.11-13 A recent systematic review has revealed signifi-
cant efficacy of acupuncture for a variety of cancer-related
symptoms.14 Although the exact mechanism of action for
acupuncture is not fully understood, recent animal and
human studies have demonstrated an effect that is mediated
in part by endogenous opioid release.15,16 These molecules
bind the same opioid receptors engaged by synthetic opi-
oids currently used for dyspnea treatment. In addition,

Abstract
Purpose. Dyspnea is a common and distressing symptom for patients with lung cancer (LC) because of disease burden,
therapy toxicity, and comorbid illnesses. Acupuncture is a centuries-old therapy with biological plausibility for relief of
dyspnea in this setting. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of acupuncture for
dyspnea among patients with LC. Methods. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of LC and clinically significant dyspnea without
a clear organic cause. The treatment consisted of 10 weekly acupuncture sessions, with a follow-up visit 4 weeks after
therapy. The primary outcome was dyspnea severity as measured using a validated Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of 0 to
10 (10 being "most severe shortness of breath imaginable"). Results. We enrolled 12 patients in the study. The median age
was 64.5 years; 66.7% of the patients were female, and 66.7% were Caucasians. Among those enrolled, 10 (83.3%) were
able to complete all 10 acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and self-limited.
Mean (SD) dyspnea scores on the NRS improved from 6.3 (1.7) at baseline to 3.6 (1.9; P = .003) at the end of treatment and
3.2 (2.3; P = .008) at follow-up. Fatigue and quality of life also improved significantly with acupuncture (P < .05). Conclusion.
Among patients with LC, acupuncture was well tolerated and exhibited promising preliminary beneficial effects in the
treatment of dyspnea, fatigue, and quality of life. Performing a trial in this population appears feasible.

neuroimaging studies suggest that acupuncture stimulation
may influence the limbic system,17 a brain region whose
activity is known to be modulated by dyspnea.7 Endogenous
opioid release and limbic system stimulation provide bio-
logical plausibility for the use of acupuncture as a treatment
for dyspnea.
As with many other integrative modalities, the scarcity
of properly designed and conducted randomized controlled
trials is a major barrier to more widespread use.18,19 A single
randomized study has evaluated acupuncture for dyspnea,
but significant issues limit interpretation of this trial. The
amount of acupuncture administered was substandard, and
the study combined acupuncture with acupressure.20 To
evaluate the potential role of traditional acupuncture for the
treatment of dyspnea in LC in a formal manner, we per-
formed a pilot study. The specific aims of this study were
(1) to evaluate the feasibility of accruing patients with LC
to a trial of acupuncture and (2) to estimate preliminary
effect size and safety of the intervention.
Materials and Methods
Study Patient Population
We recruited eligible patients from the thoracic oncology
clinics at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of
Pennsylvania. Patients 18 years and older were eligible if
they had a diagnosis of LC, a dyspnea severity score of at
least 4 on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 (10
being most severe shortness of breath imaginable), an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status
of 1 to 3 and could provide informed consent and complete
study surveys in English. Key exclusion criteria included
life expectancy of less than 12 weeks as assessed by the
treating oncologist, an organic cause of dyspnea requiring
immediate treatment (eg, pleural effusion, acute radiation
pneumonitis as measured by treatment with steroids for less
than 3 weeks, acutely progressive disease, or severe ane-
mia), or a current bleeding disorder. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients prior to participation. This study
received approval from the institutional review board at the
University of Pennsylvania.
Study Intervention
The acupuncture treatment regimen was semistandardized,
which has been an effective approach in prior studies of
acupuncture.21 The acupuncture points were chosen based on
a review of the literature and were further informed by a team
of licensed acupuncturists, a palliative care physician, and an
oncologist with knowledge of LC treatment. The primary acu-
puncture points were chosen to improve dyspnea, but addi-
tional points were presented as optional in the case of a
particular symptom (see Supplemental Table 1 [available at
http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental] for acupuncture points
used). The needles (25 or 40 mm and 0.25 gauge, Seirin,
Seirin-America Inc, Weymouth, MA) were inserted until the
patient reported a sensation of soreness (termed De Qi).
Treatments occurred in 2 stages. Patients were first seated in
a comfortable chair in the chemotherapy infusion suite to
allow the placement of anterior needles. These needles
remained in place for 15 to 20 minutes and were then
removed. Patients were then placed face down in a massage
chair for the placement of posterior needles. These needles
were also kept in place for 15 to 20 minutes and then removed.
No stimulation of the acupuncture needles was utilized.
Patients received weekly treatments for 10 weeks and had a
follow-up visit 4 weeks after the end of treatment. This dose
of acupuncture has been effective in prior trials.22 Two
licensed acupuncturists, each with greater than 10 years of
experience, administered the acupuncture.

Data Collection and Outcome Measurement
Patient-reported outcome instruments were utilized to
obtain information on symptom severity. Patients com-
pleted surveys at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at a
follow-up visit 4 weeks after treatment completion.
The primary outcome of the study was dyspnea severity
in the past 7 days, as measured by a Dyspnea NRS. Scores
on the NRS ranged from 0 (no shortness of breath) to 10
(most severe shortness of breath imaginable). NRSs have
been used extensively in the measurement of dyspnea and
are responsive to change.23
Given the limitations of unidimensional measurement of
a complex symptom such as dyspnea,23 we also used a mul-
tidimensional instrument. The Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS)
was originally written and validated in Japan to assess the
effort, anxiety, and discomfort associated with dyspnea24
and has since been validated in English.25 The CDS is struc-
tured around 3 domains: sense of discomfort, sense of anxi-
ety, and sense of effort. Scores range from 0 to 49, and a
higher score indicates more severe dyspnea. The CDS is the
only multidimensional dyspnea assessment tool that is vali-
dated in cancer patients, but it has never been used in a clini-
cal trial. Thus, we did not know its sensitivity to change and
chose to use the CDS as a secondary outcome measure.
Patients with LC often describe their dyspnea as a feel-
ing of fatigue,26 so we also measured fatigue with the Brief
Fatigue Inventory (BFI).27 The BFI is a validated instrument
for the assessment of fatigue among patients with cancer. We
also measured global quality of life using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy­Lung version (FACT-L).28
Each of these validated instruments was utilized at baseline,
at the end of treatment, and at the follow-up visit.
To monitor objective findings related to dyspnea sever-
ity, we performed spirometry and lung volume measure-
ments in the pulmonary function laboratory at the University
of Pennsylvania at baseline and at the end of treatment. In
addition, patients completed a 6-minute walk test, which
has been validated as a prognostic marker in patients with
dyspnea.29
To define the patient's impression of their dyspnea
improvement with acupuncture, we administered the Patient
Global Impression of Change instrument30 weekly through-
out therapy.
Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in STATA (STATA
v12.1, College Station, TX). For our primary outcome, we
used a paired, 2-sided t test to compare the dyspnea severity
as measured by NRS at baseline with the score at the end of
treatment. Significance was defined at .05. Based on prior
studies, the SD of a NRS measuring dyspnea among patients
with LC is 2.1.23 We hypothesized that if acupuncture could
cause an effect size of 1 SD reduction in dyspnea, we would
need 10 individuals to have 80% power to detect such dif-
ference, using a 2-sided significance level of .05. We chose
a 12-subject sample size to account for an expected loss to
follow-up rate of 15%.
To better characterize the effect of acupuncture among
patients with LC, we performed a series of paired t tests to
compare objective pulmonary measurements and symptom
severity at the end of treatment and at the follow-up visit
with baseline measurements. All tests were 2-sided, and a
significance level of .05 was used. Given our small sample
size, these evaluations should be regarded as exploratory.
Results
Participant Characteristics
We screened 17 patients to identify the 12 patients who
enrolled in our study (see Figure 1). The median age of
enrolled patients was 64.5 years, with a SD of 10 years, and
66.7% of patients were female. The racial breakdown of
enrolled patients included 66.7% Caucasians, 25% African
Americans, and 8.3% Asian Americans. Prior treatment
included surgery (25%), radiation therapy (58.3%), and
chemotherapy (75%); 33.3% of patients had recurrent/met-
astatic disease and were receiving active treatment (see
Table 1). Of note, all patients who received radiation ther-
apy also received concurrent chemotherapy.
Feasibility and Safety
In this study, 83.3% of patients were able to receive all
scheduled acupuncture treatments, with only 2 patients
unable to attend all sessions. One patient withdrew from the
study because of a long commute to the center, and another
had progression of LC while on the study and was unable to
participate further because of illness. A third patient had
progression of disease after the final acupuncture appoint-
ment and was unable to attend the follow-up visit. All
patients who completed at least 1 acupuncture session were
included in the final analysis.
Despite the use of chest wall acupuncture points in a
population with a high incidence of emphysema, no patient
experienced a pneumothorax. There were no attributable
adverse events of grade 2 or higher seen in this study.
There were 3 possibly related or related adverse events
noted during >100 acupuncture sessions. There were 2
patients who experienced mild redness/bruising near a nee-
dle site, and 1 patient experienced a minor exacerbation of
chronic back pain. All adverse events were mild and
resolved without intervention.
Improvement in Dyspnea
Mean dyspnea severity (SD) on the NRS was 6.3 (1.7) at
baseline, 3.6 (1.9) at the end of treatment, and 3.2 (2.3) at
Bauml et al 329
follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference
between both later time points and baseline (P = .003 and
.008, respectively). There was a 49% reduction in dys-
pnea severity from baseline to follow-up. This was a clin-
ically significant effect size, correlating with a Cohen's d
of 1.49 at the end of treatment and 1.53 at the follow-up.
Scores on the CDS also improved from 12.3 (6.8) at base-
line to 7.1 (4.8) at the end of treatment and 6.3 (4.8) at
follow-up. This was also a statistically significant differ-
ence (P = .04 for both comparisons). There was a numeri-
cal improvement in all subscales of the CDS at the end of
treatment and at follow-up (see Table 2). At the end of
treatment, 60% of patients reported that their dyspnea
was at least somewhat better, and at the follow-up
visit, 77.8% of patients reported at least some improve-
ment in dyspnea. No patient experienced worsening of
dyspnea.
Improvement in Related Symptoms
Overall, participants experienced an improvement in fatigue
and global quality of life at the end of treatment. The effect
on fatigue maintained statistical significance at the follow-
up visit (see Table 2). No statistically significant changes
were seen in pulmonary function testing or in 6-Minute
Walking Distance (see Table 3).

Discussion
Dyspnea is a distressing symptom that is highly prevalent
among patients with LC4-8; mitigating this symptom is a
high priority and a clear unmet need. In this pilot study, we
demonstrated successful recruitment and retention to a
study of acupuncture for dyspnea in LC. There was a statis-
tically and clinically significant improvement in dyspnea,
as measured with both the NRS and CDS. At the time of
follow-up, nearly 80% of patients reported some improve-
ment in their dyspnea. Acupuncture was well tolerated, and
there were no episodes of pneumothorax despite a signifi-
cant rate of emphysema among patients with LC. In addi-
tion to improving dyspnea, acupuncture was also associated
with improved fatigue and quality of life.
Although dyspnea is a debilitating symptom, with even
mild symptoms leading to significant interruption of normal
activities of daily living,26 currently available therapies are
inadequate. The current standard of care for dyspnea among
patients with advanced cancer is low-dose opioids, which
are associated with significant side effects.9 Our study
revealed an effect size for acupuncture that was similar to
that previously reported for opioids,31,32 with an improved
side effect profile for acupuncture. This observation needs
to be confirmed in a larger, randomized study.
Dyspnea has previously shown a strong correlation with
quality of life and fatigue.33,34 Indeed, for some patients
with LC, fatigue and dyspnea represent the same clinical
entity.26 Thus, the effect seen in our study on quality of life
and fatigue is not surprising. Interestingly, subjective dys-
pnea severity has historically exhibited poor correlation
with expected objective factors predicting degraded lung
function. For instance, dyspnea severity is not associated
with the extent of LC surgery, and its correlation with pul-
monary function tests has been inconsistent.5,35 Therefore, it
is not surprising that we were able to see an improvement in
dyspnea severity without a change in objective pulmonary
measurements. It should be noted, however, that all objec-
tive measurements exhibited a numerical improvement.
Prior studies of acupuncture for other lung diseases have
shown improvement in pulmonary function test measure-
ments.36,37 Our pilot study was not adequately powered to
detect a significant improvement.
This study has a number of important limitations. First,
the lack of a control group makes it impossible to rule out
the possibility of a placebo effect or symptomatic improve-
ment independent of the intervention itself. Whereas prior
studies have raised the concern of a placebo response to
acupuncture,38 this seems to be mostly limited to sham acu-
puncture. Prior work by our group has indicated that
response expectancy, a key component of the placebo effect,
is not a predictor of response to true acupuncture.39 Although
we cannot exclude symptomatic improvement independent
of the intervention, dyspnea and other symptoms generally
worsen over time among patients with LC.2,40 The presence
of a significant improvement in dyspnea is, thus, notable.
Next, our population was relatively heterogeneous, includ-
ing patients with cured and active cancer who had received
a variety of prior treatments. For instance, some patients
became quite ill related to their disease and were unable to
complete follow-up. Although this is certainly a limitation,
it may reflect a more "real-world" application of acupunc-
ture for dyspnea and would be expected to bias our study
toward the null. Finally, our sample size in this pilot trial
was small, which, when combined with the heterogeneous
population, may limit generalizability of our findings. Our
findings should be confirmed in a larger, randomized study.
In spite of these limitations, our study has notable
strengths. Dyspnea is a major cause of symptomatic distress
for patients with LC,4,8 and currently available therapies for
its treatment are inadequate and can have significant toxici-
ties (eg, opioids).9 Acupuncture was well tolerated by a
group of patients with LC, and performing a trial in this
population was feasible. This was the first trial to use the
CDS in the context of a clinical trial, and it seemed to be
responsive to change. In conclusion, acupuncture exhibited
promising preliminary effects in the treatment of dyspnea.
This benefit needs to be confirmed in a larger, randomized
controlled study.
