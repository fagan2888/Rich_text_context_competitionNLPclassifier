Abstract
Instruments for credit risk transfer arise endogenously from and interact with
optimizing behavior of their users. This is particularly true with credit deriva-
tives which are usually OTC contracts between banks as buyers and sellers of
credit risk. Recent literature, however, does not account for this fact when
analyzing the effects of these instruments on banking. The present paper
closes this gap by explicitly modelling the market for credit derivatives and
its interaction with banks' loan granting and deposit taking activities.

Non-technical summary
Owing to their business operations, banks are heavily exposed to credit risk. This
has traditionally been managed by passive strategies such as portfolio selection and
loan sales. The increasing availability of new instruments such as credit derivatives
and synthetic structures in the recent past, however, has allowed a more active
management of credit risk, ie credit risk transfer.
While practitioners as well as researchers increasingly take new instruments into
account, effects with respect to banks' behaviour and the stability of financial sys-
tems are not that clear. In particular, (theoretical) analyses are unable to derive
unambiguous results regarding the way credit risk transfer affects exposure to credit
risk either on the bank-level or the level of the financial system as a whole. The
main reason for this is that theoretical models usually consider the structure of
credit derivatives and synthetic instruments given exogenously. However, because
of the OTC character of these new instruments, one might expect interdependencies
to appear between contract design and banks' behavior.
The model used in the present paper considers two banks which do not compete
for depositors or lenders. Banks have the opportunity to transfer credit risk applying
a credit derivative in the form of a credit default swap (CDS). In this regard it is
assumed that bank 1 only sells credit risk and bank 2 only buys credit risk. In order
to take into account the OTC character the process of negotiating credit derivatives
is modelled as a cooperative game. In this way, one is able to show that there
appear portfolio effects in addition to the ones familiar in the context of banking
activities. In particular, we find the probability distributions of banks' returns from
loan business to improve in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This, in
turn, reduces banks' costs when funding loans by deposits. The reason for this is
that risk-averse depositors demand a lower risk premium when a bank's outcome
from loan business becomes less risky. Furthermore, this allows banks to grant more
loans, which reinforces portfolio effects. Moreover, by taking a closer look at the
financial system one finds, first, that aggregate credit risk is reduced and, second,
that credit risk transfer allocates total credit risk among banks efficiently.
In this regard, the optimal credit derivative just covers parts of the protection
buyer's total exposure to credit risk. In particular, the banks agree just to transfer
credit risk to the amount which affects the protection buyer's ability to meet his
own depositors' claims. In return, the protection seller gets payed a fixed premium
which ensures that total profits from credit risk transfer are shared optimally among
the banks.
Recent descriptive data regarding CDS transactions basically seem to support
the main results of the theoretical model in the present paper. The nominal amount
of CDS contracts outstanding steadily increased during the last few years which is
particularly true with portfolio CDS contracts. Moreover, it could be observed that
banks which participate in credit risk transfer expanded loan granting activities.
Unfortunately, currently there is no sufficient data available which allows for a more
detailed empirical analysis ­ especially with respect to banks' effective total exposure
to credit risk.

risiko ausgesetzt, bei dessen Management sie sich traditionell auf eher passive Strate-

Obwohl Praxis wie auch Wissenschaft diesen Entwicklungen zunehmend Beach-
tung schenken, sind die Auswirkungen der Nutzung von Kreditderivaten und syn-
thetischen Verbriefungen auf Banken und Finanzsystem erst wenig erforscht. Ins-
besondere gelingt es der einschl¨
agigen theoretischen Literatur bislang nicht, ein-
deutige Aussagen hinsichtlich der Beeinflussung des Kreditrisikos insgesamt auf
Bank- und Finanzsystemebene herauszuarbeiten. Zur¨
uckzuf¨

ster Linie darauf, dass ¨
ublicherweise in den Analysen von exogen gegebenen Instru-

ur den Kreditrisikohandel ausgegangen wird. In der Praxis werden diese
jedoch in der Regel durch die beteiligten Vertragspartner bilateral ausgehandelt, so
dass Abh¨
angigkeiten zwischen dem Verhalten von Banken und der Ausgestaltung
von Kreditderivaten und synthetischen Verbriefungen zu erwarten sind.
Das Modell der vorliegenden Arbeit bezieht diese Abh¨
angigkeiten explizit in die
Analyse ein. Ausgangspunkt der Modellierung sind zwei Banken, die in unter-
schiedlichen M¨
arkten im Kredit- und Einlagenbereich t¨
atig sind und somit keinem
Wettbewerb unterliegen. Durch ein Kreditderivat in Form eines Credit Default
Swap (CDS) erhalten die Banken die M¨
oglichkeit zum Kreditrisikohandel, wobei
Bank 1 lediglich als Verk¨
aufer und Bank 2 lediglich als K¨
aufer von Kreditrisiko
auftritt. Die Modellierung der optimalen Gestaltung des Kreditderivats erfolgt hier-
bei als kooperatives Verhandlungsspiel unter symmetrischer Information zwischen
den Vertragspartnern. In diesem Rahmen gelingt es zu zeigen, dass mit Hilfe des
optimalen Kreditrisikohandels Diversifikationseffekte erzeugt und ausgenutzt werden
k¨
onnen, die zus¨

seffekten auftreten. Diese ¨
außern sich in Form einer Verbesserung der Wahrschein-
lichkeitsverteilung der riskanten Ertr¨
age aus dem Kreditgesch¨
aft der am Risikohan-
del beteiligten Banken im Sinne stochastischer Dominanz erster Ordnung. In der
Folge sind die Banken in der Lage, ihre Kreditvergabe zu geringeren Kosten durch
Kundeneinlagen zu refinanzieren, da das gesunkene Ertragsrisiko ein Absenken der
an die risikoaversen Einleger zu zahlenden Risikopr¨
amie erlaubt. Als Resultat wer-
den mehr Kredite vergeben und die auftretenden Portfolioeffekte weiter verst¨
arkt.
Bei Betrachtung des gesamten Finanzsystems wird zudem deutlich, dass durch den
Risikohandel das insgesamt auftretende Kreditrisiko reduziert und dieses geringere
Risiko anschließend effizient auf die beteiligten Banken aufgeteilt werden kann.
Dar¨
uber hinaus zeigt sich, dass das im Modell bestimmte optimale Kreditderivat

Vielmehr wird Kreditrisiko nur in dem Umfang an den Sicherungsgeber transferiert,

Die vorliegenden deskriptiven Daten scheinen die Ergebnisse aus der Modellierung

Endogenous Credit Derivatives and Bank
Behavior
1 Introduction
The formation and tremendous growth of markets for credit derivatives during the
past two decades has significantly extended banks' opportunities to actively manage
credit risk. Whether this is beneficial to participating banks or even the financial
system at all is still an unresolved question. That is, recent academic analysis is
not able to determine unambiguous conclusions regarding the effects arising from
banks' use of credit derivatives.
The reason for this is that in the literature credit derivatives do not emerge
endogenously from rational behavior of involved institutions. Rather, structures of
the instruments and pricing techniques are considered exogenous. Banks' decisions
are, hence, only passive in the sense that behavior is simply adjusted to actual market
conditions. The possible impact of banks' decisions on the market environment is
usually not considered. As a result, it is found that credit derivatives allow one to
exploit effects of portfolio diversification on the one hand, and on the other hand,
banks may adjust their decisions with respect to granting loans. When they decide
to issue more risky loans it is unclear whether this offsets the portfolio effect.
In order to determine the net effect of this tradeoff one needs to consider that
credit derivatives are in general over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. That is, buyers
and sellers of credit risk exposures bilaterally negotiate the terms of credit deriva-
tives contracts. If one assumes rational behavior of both parties one might expect
interdependencies between details of credit derivatives and banks' loan granting and
deposit taking activities.
The present paper starts from this consideration and explicitly models the market
for credit derivatives.1 One is able to analyze the optimal structure of the credit
derivatives contracts as well as its interactions with banks' decisions in the deposit
and loan business, and the model picks up a number of real-world facts recently
observed in markets for credit derivatives.
In particular, a Nash-bargaining situation between two monopolistic banks is con-
sidered in which the terms of Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts are negotiated.
That is, the assumption of Nash-bargaining captures the OTC character of credit
derivatives. Furthermore, when focusing on CDS contracts one acknowledges that
this is the most common type of present credit derivatives. Moreover, since banks
make up the largest group of sellers as well as buyers of credit risk the effects of
1The model is based on chapter 5 of my dissertation completed at the University of Augsburg.

credit risk transfer within the banking system are considered. The assumption of
monopolistic banks permits one to focus on the pure effects of credit risk transfer
and prevents distorting effects which may arise from competition among banks. The
results, which are derived within this setup, undoubtedly help to better understand
the effects of credit risk transfer ongoing at present.
The main results may be summarized as follows. The application of a CDS
contract positively affects participating banks in the sense that they are less exposed
to credit risk than before entering into a CDS contract. In fact, the CDS contract
synthetically merges the loan portfolios of both banks and in this way reinforces
the effect of portfolio diversification. In this regard, the optimal structure of the
CDS contract allows a bank to exploit corresponding benefits which are then shared
among banks. For this purpose, the optimal CDS contract exhibits a number of
interesting features.
In particular, it is found that credit risk is only transferred to the extent that
the risk seller is not able to meet their own depositors' claims. Credit risk exposure
which only affects the risk seller's positive profits above this threshold is not handed
over to the risk buyer. The risk buyer, in turn, agrees to cover losses of the protection
buyer only if the claims of the risk buyer's depositors are not put at risk. A CDS
contract, thus, shifts credit risk to the bank which is better off and hence better able
to absorb risk. In other words, CDS contracts ensure that credit risk is allocated
efficiently among banks.
A more efficient allocation of credit risk, then, allows banks to expand granting
loans and taking deposits. This enhances portfolio diversification even more and
reinforces risk reducing effects of credit risk transfer. As a result, one observes a
complementary interrelationship between credit risk transfer on the one hand and
banks' loan and deposit decisions on the other hand.
In this way the present paper contributes to the relevant literature in a number
of aspects. First, explicitly modelling the market for credit derivatives considerably
extends the usual view of the literature. For example Broll and Welzel (2002), Broll
et al. (2002) and Broll et al. (2003) analyze a bank's decisions on loans, deposits and
risk management applying an industrial organization approach. That is, the bank's
technology of producing loans and deposits is given exogenously. In addition, credit
risk may be traded with some standardized derivatives instruments at fixed price.
In this context a bank has an incentive to only sell credit risk. The extend of risk
sold, then depends on the correlation between the risk exposure and the risk of the
underlying of the derivative. In contrast, the present paper argues that endogenous
credit risk transfer and OTC markets for credit derivatives is beneficial for banks
regardless if they are sellers or buyers of credit risk. Moreover, credit derivatives will
be designed such that the risk of the underlying perfectly matches the risk seller's
exposure to credit risk. Hence, there will always be a perfect hedge.
2
Another important aspect addressed in the present paper considers the inter-
action between diversification effects and bank's decision making process. Recent
papers of Wagner and Marsh (2004), Wagner (2006a), Wagner (2006b) and Wagner
(2007) start from exogenously given credit derivatives. With this assumption credit
derivatives might be used to utilize diversification effects, but the consequences re-
garding total exposures to credit risk cannot be derived. In contrast, in the present
paper it is argued that credit risk transfer allows banks to exploit diversification ef-
fects without increasing the overall risk in the market. Hence, credit risk transfer is
not only a matter of allocating risk in the financial markets efficiently, but may also
help to reduce the market's exposure to risk. In this way, the present paper is able
to show that a large number of arguments are parallel to findings in the literature on
reinsurance agreements. The seminal papers of Borch (1960), Borch (1961), Borch
(1962) and Blazenko (1986) derive similar results in the case of insurers reinsuring
some of their risk. An important difference, however, is that in these papers the
structure of reinsurance agreements is not derived endogenously. Rather, a number
of plausible exogenous reinsurance designs are considered. Therefore, the results of
the present paper are more general.
The analysis to follow is also related to papers of Hart (1975), Santomero and
Trester (1998) and Duffee and Zhou (2001) which examine the effects of innovations
in financial markets in general. A common argument in these papers is that there
may occur situations when financial innovations might reduce welfare. However,
this result is largely driven by exogenous creation of instruments and asymmetric
information. While informational problems in financial markets are not explicitly
addressed in the present paper the endogenous character of credit derivatives helps to
tradeoff a number of effects figured out in these seminal papers and find unambiguous
net effects.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 sets up the model.
Section 3 considers portfolio aspects in detail which are used to derive the main
results of the paper in section 4. Section 5 concludes. Mathematical proofs can be
found in the appendix.
2 The Model
Assumptions
For the analysis of endogenous credit risk transfer consider the following situation.
Two monopolistic banks, B1 and B2, may bilaterally negotiate a CDS contract and
in this way set up a market for credit risk. In this regard, it is assumed that B1 just
3
sells credit risk (buys protection) and B2 just buys credit risk (sells protection).2
The purpose of the CDS contract is to enable trading credit risk without affecting
the banks' balance sheets. Therefore, the contract needs to define the (part of) B1's
exposure to credit risk to be transferred to B2 and the price being payed in exchange
by the protection seller (B1).
In particular, the CDS contract transfers credit risk by defining a payment from
the protection seller to compensate the protection buyer for a loss of at least a
single loan. This implies that B1 first needs to specify a number s of loans out of
B1's loan portfolio for which credit risk is transferred. Below, s will be referred
to as the underlying of the CDS contract. Furthermore, denote R the payment of
B2 to B1 which depends, first, on the underlying's return Ys
and, second, on B2's
outcome from the loan business Xl
. Besides endogenously determining the levels of
Ys
which trigger a payment from B2 to B1 (default events) the functional definition
of R(Ys
, Xl
) allows for considering counterparty risk. That is, for a given Ys
B2
might be allowed to reduce the payment R depending on B2's disposable funds. In
this regard it needs to be mentioned that from B2's point of view R is subordinated
to its depositors' claims. In addition, let  denote the fixed premium B1 has to pay
to B2 in exchange for credit risk transfer. Finally, it is assumed that there does not
appear any asymmetric information between the banks. In this way, one is able to
focus on effects of credit risk transfer without being distorted by incentive aspects.
This opportunity for credit risk transfer needs to be incorporated into a finan-
cial system in order to analyze interdependencies between credit risk transfer and
banks' behavior. For this purpose, consider two (geographically) separated financial
markets. Each of the aforementioned banks is a monopolist in one of these markets.
Moreover, in B1's (B2's) region there is a finite number n1
(n2
) of borrowers. Each
borrower has an investment project with positive net present value available which
generates an ex ante random outcome and requires one unit of external funds. De-
note yi
 [0, y] and xi
 [0, x] the outcome of borrower i's investment project and
f(yi
) and a(xi
) the corresponding probability distribution functions (pdf) in B1's
and B2's region, respectively. Investment projects in a certain region are assumed
identical and stochastically independent. Since banks as well as borrowers are as-
sumed to lack any own funds, one needs to add lenders to the setup.
The assumptions regarding lending below truly extend the standard models in
the literature.3 In particular, there is a finite number m1
(m2
) of risk-averse lenders
in B1's (B2's) region. Let U(·) and V (·) denote lenders' strictly increasing von-
2While this assumption seems to be quite restrictive at first glance, one might argue that it is
the bank's net position in credit risk transfer which is captured by the assumption. Hence, there
appears no loss of generality in this way.
3Note that so far assumptions simply represented an application of the standard models of
Townsend (1979), Diamond (1984), and Williamson (1986) to a situation of multiple financial
markets.

Neumann-Morgenstern utility function in the region of B1 and B2, respectively.4
Each lender is endowed with one unit of funds which they wish to profitably invest.
Moreover, the number of lenders ­ and hence the amount of funds ­ in each region
are assumed to be sufficient in order to run all investment projects. Furthermore,
lenders have different levels of reservation utilities which they can realize by choosing
some opportunities outside the model. However, while each lender exactly knows his
level of reservation utility, banks as well as borrowers only know the range of possible
utility levels and some kind of probability distribution thereof. In this regard, let
URj
 [UR
, UR
] (VRj
 [VR
, VR
]) with UR
> 0 (VR
> 0) denote the domain and g(URj
)
(b(VRj
)) the corresponding pdf of lender j's reservation utility in B1's (B2's) region.
In this way it becomes possible to consider some kind of supply function for financial
funds in the model. Note, if a bank, for example, wants to take more deposits, the
price of deposits will increase, too. While this relationship is standard in economics,
the standard literature on financial intermediation so far did not account for this
fact. Rather, the focus of this strand of literature was on asymmetric information
within financial contracting situations.
In the context of the present model, there is also asymmetric information between
banks and borrowers, on the one hand, and lenders and banks, on the other hand.
In particular, assume that banks (lenders) need to incur some fixed cost c in order
to observe the actual outcome of a borrower's investment project (a bank's loan
business). That is, the costly state verification problem which is well known from
the literature may also appear in the present model. In this context, it is noteworthy
to mention that the verification cost c is the same regardless of the region or the
relationship considered. In this way, one prevents that results of the decision making
process are driven by such differences.
Owing to the assumptions above the decision making process can be represented
as a three-stage game. It starts (stage 1) with banks' decisions on optimal con-
tracts, ie loan, deposit, and CDS contracts are determined. In particular, there is a
(natural) sequence of decisions at this stage which starts with determining optimal
volumes of loan and deposit contracts by both banks. In addition, B1 optimizes the
underlying s of the CDS contract. If one refers to this set of decisions as stage 1a, at
stage 1b payment R(Ys
, Xl
) and premium  of the CDS contract are negotiated. At
stage 1c both banks decide on the optimal structure of loan and deposit contracts.
At stage 2 banks offer loan and deposit contracts to lenders and borrowers who then
4Note, the assumption that lenders behave risk-averse while banks and borrowers are risk-
neutral captures the consequences of limited liability of the latter. While Froot et al. (1993) and
Froot and Stein (1998) present arguments for risk averse behavior of borrowers and banks, Jensen
and Meckling (1976) explain that because of limited liability their level of risk aversion is less than
the one of lenders. This is particularly true if one considers lenders to be private households which
are not able to well diversify their claims. Hence, the assumptions with respect to preferences
towards risk of the present model are the most simple way to consider these arguments.

decide on accepting or not. If deposit and loan contracts have been accepted by
lenders and borrowers, investment projects will be carried out and outcomes from
investment projects and the banks' loan business will be realized. Since outcomes
are observed only by borrowers and banks, they would be apt to exploit their infor-
mational advantage opportunistically and renege on contracts (stage 3). Therefore,
rational behavior by participating actors will take this into account when designing
contracts.
Fundamentals
For the analysis of the three-stage-game presented above, the concept of subgame-
perfect Nash equilibrium will be applied. For this purpose one considers stage 3 first.
That is, provided that contracts had already been written and accepted, incentive
compatibility of deposit and loan contracts is examined in a first step. The analysis,
then, continues with stage 2. In this regard, conditions will be figured out which
ensure that lenders and borrowers are willing to accept deposit and loan contracts.
When so doing results derived for stage 3 are taken into account. At the end, stage
1 is examined. For this purpose analysis starts with determining optimal structures
of deposit and loan contracts (stage 1c), and then proceeds with analyzing optimal
CDS contracts and the optimal volumes of deposit and loan contracts. In either
case results derived for subsequent stages are taken into account. Moreover, there
are some aspects to be noted which might simplify the analysis.
In particular, because of the assumption of separate financial markets interde-
pendencies between both banks' decisions may arise only from credit risk transfer.
This makes it possible to examine optimal deposit and loan contracts of a bank
independently from the decisions of the other bank as long as CDS contracts are
taken as given. Furthermore, let k (l) and d (e) denote the volume of loan and de-
posit contracts of B1 (B2). Then B1 is able to grant k loans only if it takes enough
deposits to cover the premium of the CDS contract in addition: d = k + . B2,
however, can reduce the volume of deposits taken in order to grant l loans due to
: e = l - . This argument also considers the fact that deposit taking is costly to
the banks. Therefore, there is no reason for any bank to take more deposits than
necessary to run loan business and credit risk transfer. In the following analysis this
is considered as given.
As explained above, stage 3 of the earlier outlined game is examined first. In
this regard, it should be noted that there are two sources of incentive problems.
First, in the context of the loan contract a borrower might misreport the project
outcome to the bank if he will be able to reduce payment in this way. Second, a
bank might claim that proceeds from the loan business do not suffice to meet pre-
specified payments to depositors. Hence, loan and deposit contracts need to specify
payments and situations in which the better informed party is monitored in order
6
to ensure incentive compatibility.
As can be easily verified, optimal loan and deposit contracts which solve this
problem show the structure of standard debt contracts. Denote tK
(yi
) (pK
(xi
)) a
borrower's payment to B1 (B2) and TD
(Yk
) (PD
(Xl
)) B1's (B2's) average payment
per unit of loans to depositors. The structure of optimal incentive compatible loan
and deposit contracts, then, is
TD
(Yk
) =

. (2)
That is, the solution of the costly state verification problem in the literature still
applies in the context of the present model.5 Of course, the interpretation of the
optimal contracts is also straightforward. The contracting parties of either contract
agree on a fixed payment which is denoted TD0
, PD0
, tK0
, and pK0
in the respective
cases. As long as this fixed payment is made, there is no verification. If, however, the
payment falls short of this fixed amount, there will be verification and the payment
will be as large as possible. In the latter situation, verification costs need to be
payed in addition. Compared to the literature, there is, however, one point in which
the present model is different.
Taking a closer look at optimal deposit contracts, a banks' payment depends on
the total outcome from its loan business. In this regard, Yk
and Xl
denote B1's and
B2's total average outcome per unit of loans from the loan business. Furthermore,
define
Yk
=
1
k
(Y + R(Ys
, Xl
)) with Y =
k
i=1
tK
(yi
) and Xl
=
1
l
X with X =
l
i=1
pK
(xi
).
From these definitions it is obvious that B1's outcome from the loan business in-
cludes repayments from loan contracts as well as CDS payments. In addition, B2's
payments to depositors are not affected from credit risk transfer since CDS pay-
ments are subordinated to depositors' claims. The question is, however, whether
these optimal deposit and loan contracts are accepted by lenders and borrowers.
This latter question is exactly the focus of stage 2 of the present three-stage
game which will be analyzed next. Note, borrowers and lenders are willing to accept
offered loan and deposit contracts only if it is beneficial to them. And this means
that a certain borrower's/lender's expected utility when a loan or deposit contract

contracts without credit risk transfer.6 In formal terms this may be written from

With respect to lenders' participation constraint it should be noted that neither
bank can observe a certain lenders reservation utility. Therefore, deposit contracts
do not differ among lenders. As a result, a bank which wishes to take a certain
amount of deposits needs to write the uniform deposit contract such that the prob-
ability that a lender's reservation utility is less than the expected utility from a
deposit contract equals the desired share of lenders who accept deposit contracts.
It should be noted that results sketched so far represent optimal decisions at
stages 3 through 1c of the three-stage game. The volumes of deposit and loan
contracts as well as terms of CDS are taken as given in this context. Therefore,
these results need to be considered when examining stages 1b and 1a of the game
in the following section.
6In this regard see Pausch (2006) for a basic version of the present model without credit risk
transfer. There it is argued that banks which grant loans and take deposits provide strictly pos-
itive profits to borrowers and lenders. Moreover, they earn a strictly positive expected profit for
themselves.(p. 88ff)

3 Portfolio effects and optimal deposit and loan
contracts
From taking a closer look at borrowers' and lenders' participation constraints (3),
(4) and (5), (6) it is obvious that a bank's volume of loans is very important for the
level of expected profit and expected utility in the respective cases. A more detailed
examination of this matter, therefore, seems to be necessary.7
Considering borrowers' participation constraints first, one observes that a bor-
rower's repayment tK0
(pK0
) increases when a bank decides to grant more loans.
More formally, applying the implicit function theorem to B1's and B2's borrowers'
participation constraints ­ which are binding in the optimum ­ yields
dtK0
dk
> 0 and
dpK0
dl
> 0. (7)
At a first glance this result seems to be counterintuitive. However, if one considers
that with increasing its volume of loans a bank rises a borrower's probability of
successfully entering into a loan contract. It should be clear that in this way the
expected profit of a borrower grows ­ all other things being equal. The monopolistic
bank is then able to skim the borrower's additional expected profit by increasing
the repayment written down in the loan contract. At the end, a borrower's ex-
pected profit remains unchanged and corresponding participation constraints are
still binding.
At the deposit side of banks' business things are more complicated. As can be
easily seen from lenders' participation constraints (5) and (6), there are two ways in
which banks' decisions on the volume of loans affects lenders' expected utility. First,
a direkt effect appears, ie k and l enter (5) and (6) directly. Second, there is also an
indirect effect which affects a lender's expected utility via probability distribution
functions.
This latter indirect effect is worth to be examined in more detail. In this regard,
it proves useful to consider the cumulative distribution function of Xl
first. Note,
earlier it was argued in this context that by the assumption of CDS payment being
subordinated B2's depositors' claims are not affected by the CDS contract. There-
fore, one can apply the convolution theorem8 to determine the value of the cdf W
of Xl
at an arbitrary realization l
and given volume of loans l as
W(l
|l) =
{(pK1,...,pKl): l
i=1
pKill}
a(pK1
) . . . a(pKl
)dpKl
. . . dpK1
.
7The arguments in the present section are more intuitive in order to economize on space. For
a strictly formal treatment of the aspects see Pausch (2006, p. 132ff ).

In this latter equation we have, moreover, used the facts that pKi
= pK
(xi
)  i
and xi
being independently identically distributed with density function a(·). Now,
adding a further loan to B2's portfolio yields
W(l

(8)
given that k and l are sufficiently large to be considered continuous. In words, what
has been figured out is that there appears a portfolio effect in the sense of first-
order stochastic dominance as a bank increases the number of issued loans. That
means that the probability of low realizations of outcome from the loan business
decreases when the loan portfolio of a bank grows. This may also be interpreted as
a reduction of a bank's total exposure to credit risk due to pooling of a large number
of independent risky loans.
It is worth noting at this point that the portfolio effects which appear in the
present paper differ from similar effects in the standard literature. In particular, the
arguments of Diamond (1984), Williamson (1986), or Krasa and Villamil (1992a)
and Krasa and Villamil (1992b) apply portfolio effects based on the law of large
numbers or the large deviation principle, respectively, to figure out the value of
banks. For this reasoning, however, banks need to be very large since portfolio
effects in these papers only arise in the limit. This is not the case in the context of
the present paper. A portfolio effect in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance
occurs even when a bank is small. Hence, the value of a bank depends on the cost
of taking deposits. Therefore, the optimal size of a bank in the present model may
be determined by explicitly trading off benefits and costs of banking which was not
possible in the literature so far.
In order to determine the cost of deposit taking the relationship between the size
of the loan portfolios k and l and the optimal payments TD0
and PD0
in the banks'
10
deposit contracts, respectively, need to be examined. Unfortunately, by applying
the implicit function theorem to lenders' participation constraints (5) and (6) one
is not able to find an unambiguous relationship. Rather, there appears a tradeoff of
two effects. In this regard the portfolio effect, in general, reduces banks' credit risk
exposure which is also beneficial from lenders' point of view. Since the probabilities
of low outcomes from the banks' loan business decrease due to the portfolio effect,
lenders' risk of low repayments when entering into deposit contracts also decreases.
Hence, banks are able to reduce risk premia ­ note that lenders behave risk-averse ­
and therefore TD0
and PD0
might decrease when k and l are increased, respectively.
However, because of k = d -  and l = e + , for given  k and l can increase only
if the banks take more deposits d and e. For this purpose, lenders' expected utility
from entering into deposit contracts needs to increase which means that banks need
to raise TD0
and PD0
. Hence, the net effect depends on the relative strength of both
effects just explained.
However, since the present paper aims at an examination of an interior optimum
for k and l it is obvious that the total effect of increasing the volume of loans cannot
be negative. If this would be the case, increasing k and l would allow to reduce TD0
and PD0
, respectively, which reduces banks' costs of deposit taking. At the same
time, due to (7) expected profits of both banks would increase. In this situation
further increasing the volumes of loans is beneficial. Therefore, an optimum is
arrived only if
TD0
k
 0 ;
PD0
l
 0. (9)
The cost of deposit taking of both banks are, in addition, affected by the CDS
contract. In particular, the premium  might shift TD0
and PD0
whereas the pay-
ments R(Ys
, Xl
)  (Ys
, Xl
) might furthermore shift the optimal level TD0
.9 In this
regard, applying the implicit function theorem to lenders' participation constraints
(5) and (6) yields
TD0

> 0 and
PD0

< 0. (10)
The reason for this is that a higher  means to increase (decrease) the volume of
deposits (loans) of B1 in order to hold constant the volume of loans (deposits). How-
ever, taking more deposits forces the B1 to increase lenders' expected utility from
accepting deposit contracts. In contrast, reducing the volume of loans and leaving
constant the amount of deposit contracts hurts the portfolio effect and increases
B1's exposure to risk. Risk averse lenders will demand a higher risk premium in
this latter situation. Hence, in either case TD0
needs to increase when  increases.
With respect to B2 the converse argument is true: for B2  represents an addi-
tional source of income. As a result, B2 may reduce deposit taking in order to issue
9Note, PD0
of B2 is independent from R(·) due to the subordinated character of the CDS
contract.
11
a certain volume of loans. Hence, PD0
may decrease and deposit taking becomes
less expensive to B2 when  increases.
To figure out the relationship between TD0
and R(·) it should, first, be noted
that R(·) does not enter constraint (5) directly. Rather, R(·) may be interpreted
as an additional source of income of B1. Hence, it affects TD0
via the probability
distribution function H(·) of Yk
= 1
k
(Y + R(Ys
, Xl
)). It is, therefore, necessary to
examine H(·) in more detail. Basically, for this purpose the well known convolution
theorem will be applied. However, the approach needs to be modified because Y
and R(Ys
, Xl
) are stochastically dependent due to Ys
. One, therefore, derives
H(k
) =
{tK (y1),...,tK (yk-s): k-s
i=1

In equation (11) loans i  {s-k+1; . . . ; k} form the underlying of the CDS contract
with corresponding total outcome of Ys
= k

tK
(yi
). Moreover, FR|Ys
denotes
the conditional cumulative distribution function of R(·) given a certain realization of
Ys
. If one, now, considers some realization (ys
, xl
) of (Ys
, Xl
) from (11) it is obvious
that
H(k
)
R(Ys
, Xl
)
 0 ;  k
; (Ys
, Xl
). (12)
In this regard, increasing R(·) for any given realization of (Ys
, Xl
) apparently reduces
the probability that Yk
falls below some arbitrary threshold k
. That is, the payment
of the CDS contract reinforces the portfolio effect in B1's loan business. As a result,
B1's loan business becomes less risky which is beneficial to lenders and allows to
reduce the risk premium implied in B1's deposit contracts. Hence, it must be true
that
H(k

R(Ys
, Xl
)
 0 and
TD0
R(Ys
, Xl

; (Ys

With these findings in mind, one can proceed with the determination of the op-
timal CDS contract and optimal decisions on volumes of deposit and loan contracts
in the next section.

4 The optimum
The fundamental results outlined in the previous sections allow for an examination
of optimal endogenous CDS contracts and optimal volumes of deposits and loans
in the following. More formally, analysis of the three-stage game proceeds with an
examination of stage 1b and, thereafter, stage 1a. That is, one continues to apply
the technique of backward induction to stages 1b and 1a taking into account results
at stages 3 through 1c.
4.1 The optimal CDS contract
In order to consider the OTC character of a CDS contract banks' negotiation process
is modelled as a cooperative game. The idea is that banks' objective to maximize
expected profit also implies maximizing benefits from credit risk transfer. However,
banks are free to enter into a CDS contract or not. Hence, the negotiation process
will be successful only if either bank is better off with credit risk transfer. There-
fore, rational behavior of banks makes for maximizing joint profit from credit risk
transfer and sharing proceeds between banks. Given the assumptions of the present
model this cooperative game can be solved applying the bargaining solution of Nash
(1953).10
For this purpose banks determine the premium  and payments R(Ys
, Xl
)  (Ys
, Xl
)
of the CDS contract such that the increase of joint profit due to credit risk transfer
is maximized. This, however, ist constrained by the fact that any payment R(Ys
, Xl
)
is bounded above by B2's remaining funds after having payed depositors. Further-
more, payments R(Ys
, Xl
) are assumed to be non-negative and premium  is strictly
positive in an effective CDS contract. Formally this maximization problem can be
written as
max
,{R(Ys,Xl)}(Ys,Xl)
[E(1CDS
) - E(1
)][E(2CDS
) - E(2
)] (14)
s.t. R(Ys
, Xl
)  l(Xl
- PD0
())  Xl
> PD0
(15)
R(Ys
, Xl
)  0  Xl
> PD0
(16)
 > 0. (17)
In order to solve the optimization problem optimal volumes of deposit and loans
contracts of both banks as well as the optimal underlying of the CDS are considered
as given. As a result, one can state and prove
10See Pausch (2006, S. 176ff) for a more detailed discussion regarding the application of the Nash
bargaining solution.
13
Proposition 1 For any given k, l, and s the optimal CDS contract is characterized
by the following payment function:
R(Ys
, Xl
) =







min min{stK0
; kTD0
} - Ys
; l(Xl
- PD0
) - (Ys
(Xl
), Xl
) if()
0 else
with () = {Xl
> PD0
; Ys
< min{stK0
; kTD0
}} and (Ys
(Xl
), Xl
)  0. The optimal
premium  ensures an optimal allocation of credit risk to both banks.
Proof: See the appendix.
At first glance, the structure of the optimal CDS contract looks quite complex
and, hence, some comments seem to be appropriate. In this regard, note first that
both banks agree on a kind of default event which triggers a payment of B2 to B1.
This is the interpretation of the term min{stk0
; kTD0
} - Ys
. In particular, the total
outcome from the underlying of the CDS contract is compared to a threshold which
is the minimum of the highest realization of Ys
and B1's depositors' total claims. If
Ys
falls short of this threshold, B2 will have to cover exactly the difference. This, of
course, requires that B2's funds are enough after paying depositors' claims. Other-
wise, B2 will pay a lower amount to B1 in case of default. In this latter situation,
note that B2 will never pay all remaining funds to B1. Else, it is obvious from
constraint (15) that B2 would end up without any own funds and expected profit
of E(2CDS
) = 0 < E(2
). That is, whenever B2 has to pay some strictly positive
R(·) to B1 an arbitrary low amount (·) will be retained. Therefore, constraint (15)
will never bind for any Xl
> PD0
. At the end, there will be, of course, no strictly
positive payment R(·) as long as there is no default at B1 and/or B2's earnings
from granting loans do not exceed depositors' claims. As a result, with determining
optimal payments R(·) the banks optimize the allocation of credit risk in the present
model of a financial system.
But this is only part of the story. The arguments above made clear that the CDS
contract allows B1 to get rid of some part of credit risk which is, instead, borne
by B2. Bearing this in mind, it is obvious that B1 gains from credit risk transfer
whereas B2 might suffer a loss. Therefore, there needs to be a compensation to B2
which optimally allocates benefits from credit risk transfer. This is what determines
the optimal premium . Unfortunately, the optimal allocation of benefits from
writing a CDS contract depends on a number of parameters just like the probability
distributions of investment projects' outcomes and lenders' utility functions. One
is, thus, not able to derive more detailed results regarding the optimal level of .
Moreover, results have been derived for given underlying and volumes of deposit
and loan contracts of both banks. Therefore, changing one of these parameters might
affect R(·) and  which makes it necessary to do some comparative statics. However,
14
in order to economize on space results in this regard will be derived intuitively.11 In
this way, it is found out that
R(Ys
, Xl
)
s
 0 ;

s
 0 ; (Ys
, Xl
). (18)
That is, as long as s < k holds increasing s means that there are more loans of
B1 included in the underlying of the CDS contract. This causes a portfolio effect
in the sense of first order stochastic dominance: the probability of low realizations
and, hence, the probability of high payments of B2 decreases. In other words, B2's
risk of covering losses from B1's credit risk decreases. This makes the CDS contract
more beneficial for B2 but less valuable for B1. As a result, B1 is less willing to
enter into a CDS contract and adjustments need to occur to ensure both banks to
enter into the contract. For this purpose R(·) needs to increase and / or  has to
decrease. Furthermore, when s  k then there is no change in the underlying and
no portfolio effect appears. Therefore, in this situation both banks' benefits remain
unchanged when s increases and no adjustments of R(·) and  will occur.
Taking a look at the effect of changing B1's volume of loans k on the details of
the CDS contract R(·) and , in general, one is not able to derive unambiguous
results. The reason for this is that there appears a tradeoff. On the one hand,
increasing k reinforces B1's portfolio effect in the sense that low realizations of B1's
outcome from granting loans become less likely. On the other hand, in order to
increase k B1 needs to take more deposits. For this purpose payments to depositors
have to increase which makes B1's costs of deposit taking to increase, too. The
net effect, however, depends on the relative strength of both partial effects and
general unambiguous conclusions are not available. But if one considers a situation
of optimal decisions it is obvious that reducing R(·) and / or rising  when k is
increased makes the CDS contract less beneficial for B1. That is, when R(·) decreases
and / or  increases low realizations in B1's earnings become more likely and / or
credit risk transfer becomes more expensive. As a result, B1's depositors demand
even higher repayment due to higher risk premia which leaves B1 worse off and less
willing to enter into a CDS contract. Therefore, in the optimum it must be true
that
R(Ys
, Xl
)
k
 0 ;

k
 0 ;  (Ys
, Xl
). (19)
4.2 Optimizing banking activities and hedging
As explained earlier, the final step in the analysis of banks' behavior when credit
derivatives are endogenous regards the examination of stage 1a of the three-stage
game. That is, in the following optimal amounts of deposit and loan contracts as
11For a formal treatment, the reader may be referred to Pausch (2006, ch. 5.2.5).
15
well as the optimal underlying of the CDS contract will be determined. For this
purpose the previous results need to be considered.
Note first that there is a well-defined relationship between a bank's volumes of
deposit and loan contracts. In section 2 above, it was explained that d = k + 
and e = l -  holds for B1 and B2, respectively. As a result, given the optimal
premium  it is sufficient to examine optimal volumes of loans explicitly. The
optimal numbers of deposit contracts can, then, be calculated as a residual. Second,
from the optimal structure of the CDS contract of Proposition 1 one can conclude
Yk
= tK0
.
In words: B1's maximum average outcome per unit of loans is exactly the repayment
obligation of a loan contract which does not default. It will prove useful to keep in
mind these observations when, in the following, optimal volumes of loan and deposit
contracts and the optimal underlying of the CDS contract is determined.
For this purpose, both banks decide on the optimal number of loan contracts in
order to maximize expected profits. In addition, B1 determines the optimal level
of s which defines the underlying of the CDS contract. Moreover, in either case
lenders' participation constraints (5) and (6) need to be considered. Formally, B1's
optimization problem may be written as
max
k,s
E(1CDS
)
s.t.
k + (k, s)
m1
 G(EU1-nCDS
) (20)
k, s > 0.
From the examination of the optimization problems of both banks one can conclude
Proposition 2 The optimal volume of loans of the protection buyer (B1) does not
decrease due to credit risk transfer. B1's optimal volume of deposits strictly increases
due to credit risk transfer.
Proof: see the appendix.
Proposition 1 states that there is an interrelationship between B1's loan granting
and deposit taking activities and credit risk transfer. As can be observed from the
proof of Proposition 2 B1's optimal volumes of deposits and loans are driven by
a tradeoff. On the one hand, offering more loans allows B1 to increase payment
tK0
which, in turn increases expected profit ­ see arguments in section 3. On the
other hand, in order to grant more loans B1 needs to take more deposits. Since
lenders, however, are willing to buy additional deposits only if their expected utility
increases, B1 has to pay more TD0
­ see arguments of section 3. Optimality, then,
16
appears when marginal profit from extending loan business just outweighs marginal
costs from taking more deposits.
This tradeoff is affected by the portfolio effect which occurs because of credit risk
transfer. In section 3 it has been shown that due to the payment R(·) of the CDS
the pdf of B1's earnings improves in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.
From the lenders' point of view this means that B1's loan business becomes less
risky. With risk aversion of lenders this portfolio effect reduces B1's cost of deposit
taking since less risk in granting loans allows to reduce risk premium for lenders. In
other words, credit risk transfer reduces marginal cost of deposit taking. Hence, the
tradeoff explained above results in more deposits and loans with credit risk transfer.
This, however, raises the question of the optimal level of credit risk transfer, ie the
optimal underlying of the CDS contract needs to be determined. The examination
of B1's optimization problem yields
Proposition 3 The optimal underlying of the CDS contract is the complete loan
portfolio of B1.
Proof: See the appendix.
The reasons for this result are obvious if one considers the arguments presented
in section 4.1 when the optimal CDS contract was examined. In particular, it has
been argued that as long as s < k increasing s allows to increase R(·) and reduce
. Both effects are beneficial to B1: increasing R(·) reinforces the risk reducing
effect of credit risk transfer and reducing  makes using the CDS contract less
costly. Therefore, it is optimal to choose the largest underlying possible which is
the complete loan portfolio of B1.
At the end, we take a closer look at B2's optimal volumes of deposits and loans.
In this regard it is easy to see that due to lenders' participation constraint (6) B2
cannot reduce the volume of deposits. If it did, lenders would suffer a loss of expected
utility and would, hence, not longer be willing to accept deposit contracts. Due to
l = e +  it is obvious that the premium from the CDS contract will be used to
increase loan granting. Therefore, with respect to B2 one can summarize:
Proposition 4 The protection seller's (B2) optimal volumes of deposits and loans
increase due to credit risk transfer.
4.3 Results and Interpretations
The results presented in the previous sections allow for a number of very interesting
conclusions and interpretations. In this regard it should, first, be noted that with
Proposition 3 one is able to refine the optimal CDS contract.
17
Proposition 5 In the optimum the payment function of the CDS contract is
R(Yk
, Xl
) =







min{k(TD0
- Yk
); l(Xl
- PD0
) - (Yk
, Xl
)} if ()
0 else
with () = {Yk
< TD0
; Xl
> PD0
} and (Yk
, Xl
)  0.
That is, result 5 generalises and extends the main findings known from the lit-
erature. In particular, the industrial organisation approach to banking states that
a full hedge is optimal only in a situation when there is no basis risk included in
a CDS contract. However, owing to the OTC-character of credit risk transfer the
present analysis could show that banks' rational behaviour prevents the appearance
of basis risk. The optimal CDS contract always exhibits a perfect correlation with
B1's exposure to credit risk. Therefore, a full hedge of B1's credit risk is optimal.
Furthermore, from the inspection of Proposition 5 one observes that the default
event in the optimum is kTD0
. That is, there is a CDS payment only in the event
of B1 not being able to meet its depositors' claims. All variations in B1's profit
exceeding this threshold are not covered by the CDS contract. Moreover, the CDS
payment just covers the claims of B1's depositors. The effects of this kind of contract
design are twofold. On the one hand it insures B1's depositors against losses, which
allows a reduction of risk premia due to risk aversion, which, in turn, generates
additional profits for B1. On the other hand, the CDS contract generates no adverse
incentives to B1. This is true since any positive level of profit still exposes B1
to credit risk. Hence ­ while not explicitly modelled ­ B1 will not conduct any
hazardous action such as reducing monitoring borrowers.
Keeping in mind the arguments lined out in the previous sections, one is now able
to derive a number of conclusions about the role and the effects of credit derivatives.
The optimal CDS contract implies the following relationship between both banks'
average outcomes from granting loans:
Xl
= Xl
+
k
l
Yk
-
k
l
Yk
or X = (X + Y ) - Y.
That is, the CDS contract in fact merges loan portfolios of both banks synthetically
and defines how to share total outcome (X + Y ) among both banks. Thus, B1 (B2)
actually receives Y (X). Moreover, realizations of X + Y increase compared with
the situation without credit risk transfer. The reason is that both banks increase
their optimal volume of loans, which causes tK0
and pK0
to increase. However, this
does not mean that, at the same time, banks are more exposed to credit risk than
before they started to use CDS contracts. This can be seen from the cumulative
probability distribution function of actual outcomes from both banks' loan business.
18
The cumulative probability distribution function of B1's actual outcomes was
shown to be
H(Yk
) =
Yk
0
hYk
(Yk
)FR|Yk
(k(Yk
- Yk
))dYk
above.12 Moreover, the conditional cumulative distribution function FR|Yk
(·) may
be rewritten using the previous results as
FR|Yk
(k(Yk
- Yk
)) = W PD0
+
k
l
(Yk
- Yk
) =
PD0+ k
l
(Yk-Yk)
0
w(Xl
)dXl
.
In other words, the probability of R falling short of k(Yk
- Yk
) for given Yk
cor-
responds to the probability of B2's outcome from loan business being less than
PD0
+ k
l
(Yk
- Yk
). Hence, the probability distribution of B1's actual outcome Yk
is
derived from a convolution of random variables Yk
and Xl
, which causes a portfolio
effect in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. That means the aggregate
level of credit risk decreases due to credit risk transfer. Moreover, since the CDS
contract then allocates this reduced credit risk among banks, each bank faces a lower
level of risk from granting loans. As a result, granting more loans does not increase
credit risk at all. This argument is further supported if one considers B2's earnings'
cumulative probability distribution function:
W(Xl
) = 1 - H Yk
-
k
l
(Xl
- Xl
) .
As is obvious from this latter equation, the cumulative probability distribution func-
tion of B2's outcome from granting loans is derived by calculating the convolution
of probability distributions of Yk
and Xl
.
A notable aspect in this regard is that, with the optimal CDS contract, credit
risk transfer becomes effective only in a well-defined set of situations. In particular,
a CDS payment R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0 appears if, and only if, Yk
< TD0
and, at the same
time, Xl
> PD0
holds. That is, at first a positive CDS payment requires B1 to be in
financial difficulty and, second, B2 simultaneously has excess funds. Therefore, one
might conclude that credit risk transfer from B1 to B2 only appears in a situation
when B2 is better able to absorb risk than B1, which undoubtedly enhances financial
stability.

character of CDS contracts. Both banks were, moreover, active in loan granting and
deposit taking in a market environment with a costly state verification problem.
With these assumptions the model also captures interdependencies between writing
a CDS contract on the one hand and decision making in banks' deposit and loan
business on the other.
The examination of the resulting three-stage game determined a very interesting
optimal structure of the CDS contract. It has been shown that the risk buyer
only pays a pre-specified amount to the risk seller, when the latter's funds are
insufficient to meet own depositors' claims. Moreover, the payment of the risk buyer
exactly covers the difference between the risk seller's funds and his depositors' claims.
However, counterparty risk ­ that is, the risk that the risk buyer is not able to make
this payment ­ prevents that this optimal payment is made at any time. Therefore,
the optimal up-front premium of the CDS contract needs to be adjusted adequately.
Furthermore, in the model it has been derived that by using CDS contracts both
banks' loan granting and deposit taking activities are extended. The reason for
this is, that with an optimal CDS contract both banks synthetically merge their
loan portfolios. This creates a portfolio effect which reduces a bank's probability to
realize low outcomes from the loan business. As a result, the probability of both
banks' depositors claims being met increases. This reduces funding costs of both
banks and allows them to expand loan granting and deposit taking activities. Hence,
credit risk transfer with credit derivatives is valuable.
However, while these results are quite encouraging it should be noted that the
model of the present paper abstracts from important aspects of the real market en-
vironment. The two banks in the model, for example, are local monopolists. Hence,
there are no forces of competition which might affect banks' behavior in both loan
and deposit business and credit risk transfer. But Pausch and Schweimayer (2004)
argue in their industrial organization approach with exogenous credit derivatives
that banks might use derivatives as strategic device in competition for borrowers
and lenders. Nevertheless, against the background of the results in the present pa-
per a more realistic model with endogenous markets for credit risk transfer might
help better understand issues in this regard.
Another useful extension of the present model would be to consider asymmetric
information between participants in credit risk transfer. The recent literature sug-
gests that this might be a very important issue. For example Morrison (2005) and
Parlour and Plantin (2005) examine questions in this regard. However, in their pa-
pers credit derivatives are, again, exogenous which captures just part of the relevant
effects.
Nevertheless, from an empirical point of view recent descriptive data from CDS
markets seem to support the main results of the present paper. That is, besides the
20
steadily increasing nominal amount of CDS contracts outstanding one can observe,
in particular, growing relevance of portfolio credit default swaps. In addition, banks
which participate in credit risk transfer expanded their loan granting activities.
Unfortunately, due to reasons of data availability one is not able at present to
perform a more detailed empirical analysis. This is particularly true with respect
to an examination of banks' total exposure to credit risk after participating in CDS
markets.
To sum up, the considerations of the present paper provide a number of important
insights into the nature and the role of credit derivatives. The conclusions are
unambiguous since by endogenizing the formation of credit derivatives one is able
to trade off diversification effects on the one hand and banks' risk taking behavior
on the other. In this way, the present paper makes a first attempt to close a gap
in the recent literature on credit risk transfer and credit derivatives. However, as
is obvious from the discussion above, there is still a number of important aspects
which are not analyzed in sufficient detail. Hence, further research on these issues
is necessary.
Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1
In order to derive the optimal CDS contract, at first, expected profits of both banks
need to be formulated appropriately:
E(1CDS
) = Yk
(, R(·)) - TD0
(, R(·)) -
Yk(,R(·))
TD0(,R(·))
H(Yk
)dYk
(21)
E(2CDS

(22)
where Xl
= 1
l
(X - R(Ys
, Xl
)) with corresponding cdf
W(l
) =
Ys
hs
(Ys
) 1 - FR|Ys
(l(Xl
- l
)) dYs
.
Moreover, hs
(·) denotes the pdf of the realizations of the outcome of the CDS's
underlying. In addition, in the following Hs
(·) represents the cdf of the returns from
the part of B1's loan portfolio which is not included in the underlying of the CDS.
The following arguments consider the fact that constraint (15) of the maximiza-
tion problem for the optimal CDS is not binding. It is easily verified that otherwise
21
B2 were not able to earn any positive profit and were, hence, worse off compared to
non-participating in CDS. Using this observation, first-order necessary conditions
for an optimal CDS are
TD0

))

 R(Ys

)  0 ; Xl
> PD0
. (24)
The first step of the proof shows Ys
+ R(Ys
, Xl
)  kTD0
 R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0. For
this purpose consider realizations (Y b
s
, Xb
l
) and (Y m
s
, Xm

) with R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
) > 0 and
(Y m
s
, Xm
l
) = arg max Ys
+ R(Ys
, Xl
)  R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0. If in this situation
kTD0
< Y b
s
+ R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
) < Y m
s
+ R(Y m
s
, Xm
l
)
would hold, it is obvious from condition (24) that
Yk

=
Yk
TD0

needs to be true. This, however, is impossible since
kYk
- (k - s)tK0
- (Y b
s
+ R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
)) > 0
implies
Yk

<
Yk
TD0
Hs

­ a contradiction. Therefore, in the optimum it must be true that Ys
+ R(Ys
, Xl
) 
kTD0
 R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0 holds.
This result may be extended to Ys
+R(Ys
, Xl
)  stK0
 R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0 since there
may be a difference between k and s. And, indeed, for the situation stK0
 kTD0
this
follows immediately from arguments above. In the situation stK0
< kTD0
, however,
arguments need to be modified. If one defines (Y m
s
, Xm
l
) and (Y b
s
, Xb
l
) just like in
the previous case it might be asked whether a situation
stK0
< Y b
s
+ R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
) < Y m
s
+ R(Y m
s
, Xm
l
)  kTD0
with R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
) > 0 and R(Y m
s
, Xm
l
) > 0 may occur. If this was the case, one finds
for the second-line terms of (24)
Yk
TD0
Hs
(kYk
- (Y m

+ R(Y m
s

<

TD0
Hs

+ R(Y b

22
which is the same as in the previous situation. Furthermore, with replacing TD0
R(·)
in
first-line terms of (24) by expressions derived from applying the implicit function
theorem to lenders' participation constraints (5), one finds
TD0
R(Y m
s
,Xm
l
)
(1 - H(TD0
))
hs
(Y m

R(Y m

hs

R(Y b

.
Since it is obvious from above relationships that in the present situation R(Y m
s
, Xm
l
)
and R(Y b
s
, Xb
l
) cannot satisfy first-order necessary conditions (24) simultaneously, it
must be true that ­ considering the earlier result ­ in an optimal CDS
Ys
+ R(Ys
, Xl
)  min{stK0
; kTD0
}  R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0.
Moreover, from the arguments presented above it becomes immediately clear that
Ys
+ R(Ys
, Xl
) = min{stK0
; kTD0
}  R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0 and (Ys
, Xl
)
must hold. Otherwise, first order necessary conditions (24) were not satisfied by
all optimal payments R(Ys
, Xl
) > 0 simultaneously. However, in the case that
counterparty risk is striking, ie R(Ys
, Xl
) > l(Xl
- PD0
), B2 is not able to pay the
optimal payment. But from above arguments it is obvious that B2 will pay as much
as possible in this situation. That is, B2's retained funds approach zero in this case:
(Ys
(Xl
), Xl
)  0.
Proof of Proposition 2
To prove Proposition 2 maximization problem (20) is solved using the definition of
E(1CDS
) in the proof of Proposition 1.
The first-order necessary condition for optimal k, then, is

Now, let k denote the optimal volume of loans when B1 enters the CDS contract
and k the optimal volume of loans when there is no credit risk transfer. Suppose
23
k < k , then for the first-order necessary condition one yields
-

In this latter equation replace TD0

which contradicts first-order necessary condition above. Hence in the optimum
k  k must be true. Furthermore, from this result and d = k +  it is obvious that
 > 0 implies a strictly increasing optimal volume of deposits due to credit risk
transfer.

for the optimal s

where we have used the fact that Proposition 2 implies that the participation con-
straint is not binding.
From this latter equation, it can be easily shown that s < k cannot be an optimal
solution. The reason is that, owing to TD0

> 0, TD0
R(Ys,Xl)
 0, H(Yk)
R(Ys,Xl)
 0, and
1 - H(TD0
) > 0 both terms on the left hand side of the equation are positive with
s < k. Moreover, since any s > k does not create a further effect of first-order
stochastic dominance, any CDS contract with s > k needs to include the same
payments R(·) and premium  as does a contract with s = k. Therefore, the
optimal underlying covers the complete loan portfolio of B1.
