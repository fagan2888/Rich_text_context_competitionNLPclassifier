Abstract
We present a visual analytics approach to explore and analyze movement data as collected by ecologists
interested in understanding migration. Migration is an important and intriguing process in animal ecology,
which may be better understood through the study of tracks for individuals in their environmental context.
Our approach enables ecologists to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of such tracks interactively. It
identifies and aggregates stopovers depending on a scale at which the data is visualized. Statistics of stopover
sites and links between them are shown on a zoomable geographic map which allows to interactively explore
directed sequences of stopovers from an origin to a destination. In addition, the spatio-temporal properties of
the trajectories are visualized by means of a density plot on a geographic map and a calendar view. To evalu-
ate our visual analytics approach, we applied it on a data set of 75 migrating gulls that were tracked over a
period of 3 years. The evaluation by an expert user confirms that our approach supports ecologists in their
analysis workflow by helping to identifying interesting stopover locations, environmental conditions or
(groups of) individuals with characteristic migratory behavior, and allows therefore to focus on visual data
analysis.

Introduction
The study of animal movement has long been of inter-
est. Starting in the 1990s, the availability of new tech-
nology has led to increasingly detailed and diverse
types of data relating to movement.1 Global
Positioning System (GPS)-based movement tracks are
currently among the most frequently collected types of
data. Because of its relative accuracy and high sam-
pling rate, the GPS technology drastically improved
the ability to describe and gain new insights about ani-
mal movement. The continuing miniaturization allows
at the same time to collect data for an increasing range
of species and conditions.2 Today, animal movement
tracks form one of the main data sources when
studying the mechanics of movements, navigational
cues, or drivers of movement, constantly leading to
new insights on animal physiology, behavior, and
demography.3 Through those advances, ecologists are
starting to ask novel questions on the causes of move-
ment and its consequences for individuals, popula-
tions, and ecosystems for which formal analysis
techniques are not always readily available. Kays
et al.2 claim that interdisciplinary research between
data scientists--computer scientists, statisticians--and
ecologists will be required to develop these new tools
efficiently and will eventually lead to new insights and
scientific breakthroughs.

The goal of data visualization is to provide insights
into data.4 New visualization techniques and visual
encodings help users to understand their data sets.
Furthermore, visual analytics can be used to generate
knowledge from large and often complex data sets by
developing and deploying analytical and visualization
techniques.5
To support an ecologist in her search for new
knowledge, a visualization expert needs to spend time
and effort to understand the relevant questions, data,
and the general ecological context of a study system--
knowledge which has often not be acquired a priori.
An ecologist does, however, not commonly have an
overview of the analysis and visualization possibilities
that are technically feasible or how these would help in
answering certain ecological research questions. Thus,
a knowledge gap between domain experts and visuali-
zation designers exists.4,6 Explorative visualization can
help in filling this gap as it provides means for ecolo-
gists to discover new trends, to present a data set
visually, to identify pertinent subsets, to compare the
movement of individuals, and to locate moving enti-
ties, among other tasks. Abstracting such tasks helps
to reason about similarities and differences between
them, to distinguish between different goals, and to
guide data abstraction.7 Eventually, exploratory visua-
lization provides a novel analytical means and there-
fore leads to new ecological insights. In addition, it
may help the users to build trust in their generated
knowledge base.5
The current practice of ecologists to investigate and
visualize movement is by developing and using
MATLAB or R libraries.6,8 Those results are either
analyzed and visualized statically or plotted on top of
satellite maps. Few bird ecologists examined move-
ment data in interactive visualizations with multiple
coordinated views or used a Google Earth­based tool
for exploring GPS data from a bird's eye perspective,
both of which have been of limited value.6 It seems
that a tight integration of different spatio-temporal
views of the data, with a flexible selection, would be
beneficial to ecologists to focus on data analysis
mechanisms rather than laborious coding.9
In this article, we present such a technique. It com-
prises a novel visual analytics approach to help explore
animal migration patterns interactively. Our approach
provides analytical and visual means to understand
different aspects of migration through an aggregation
at various spatial scales, with interlinked geographical
maps, and views on spatio-temporal events. Migration
is ubiquitous in ecology. It is the seasonal displace-
ment of individuals between sites. In our approach, we
identify and aggregate stopovers. A stopover is a break
within a migratory trajectory. Functionally, stopovers
are important for foraging, resting, or socializing with
conspecifics, but stopovers can also be used diagnosti-
cally to recognize different migration strategies: along
the coastline, over sea, or over land.
Past research on visualizing gull migration lack an
aggregation of the trajectories8 or impose visual clutter
by drawing the results of the clustering as colored data
points on a map.9 Our visual analytics approach reme-
dies this by employing a stopover aggregation visualiza-
tion, a density map, and a calendar view (see Figure 1).
The stopover aggregation and density map are plotted
on top of interconnected zoomable geographic maps.
The user can select stopovers and impose constraints
on spatio-temporal properties of the selection.
We applied our approach to a data set of 75 migrat-
ing Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus), which we
will henceforth denote as ``gulls'' in this article. We
evaluated our tool by consulting an expert user10 with
an expertise on bird migration to assess the strengths
and weaknesses of our approach. We identified ecolo-
gical research questions and requirements on the visual
design and mapped them to analytical tasks that the
expert user completed. In this article, we use the terms
moving entities and individuals interchangeably.
Our qualitative evaluation confirms that our
approach helps ecologists in their analysis of migration
patterns, so that they are able to identify and to isolate
groups of individuals with a certain migration behavior
visually rather than in non-visual computations. This
speeds up and fosters their analytical workflow because
our approach empowers ecologists to focus on inter-
preting the data and on developing new questions
without being distracted by coding or by algorithmic
technicalities.

To identify different homogeneous movement episodes
in trajectory data, trajectories are commonly segmen-
ted, that is, cut into parts, according to characteristics
of the movement. Segmentation together with classifi-
cation or clustering of movement data helps to sum-
marize and visualize large trajectory data sets.
Visualization techniques on movement data support
users in identifying new trends within data sets. We
survey past research on visualization and clustering of
movement data from various application backgrounds
to give an overview of recent achievements in these
fields.
Segmentation algorithms have been successfully
applied to migrating geese11,12 and gulls9 among many
other studies.13­19 These approaches segment individ-
ual trajectories into pieces of similar movements.
Buchin et al.20 present algorithms to summarize seg-
mentations of a larger number of trajectories in a flow

players to analyze spatial formations and plays.
To aggregate movement data, Andrienko and
Andrienko21 transformed trajectories into aggregate
flows between spatial regions within their visual analy-
tics approach. This type of aggregation allows group-
ings of essential characteristics of the movement. In
their approach, the user can control the overall level of
abstraction of the visualization interactively. Andrienko
and Andrienko21 applied their approach to deer and
stork data and to trajectories in an urban context,
where the aggregated results are visualized as flow
maps or as transition matrices.
Density visualization is a powerful visualization tech-
nique for analyzing many trajectories. One such example
is the work by Willems et al.,22 which presents a multi-
scale density visualization for trajectories. They demon-
strate it on vessel trajectories. The visualization of the
density fields is derived from the convolution of the
dynamic vessel position with a kernel that takes the speed
of the movement into account. The density fields are
illuminated as height maps on top of the heat map.
Additionally, Willems et al.22 visualize the individual's
contribution of a moving point within the overall density.
Scheepens et al.23 use a similar approach to visua-
lize densities of maritime trajectories, for which they
apply a cascade of filtering and selection mechanisms
on top of the density maps. These selection mechan-
isms are sensitive to a user role, either a domain expert
or an operator, and to the task at hand. An operator is
usually only concerned with events connected to his
work task, such as surveillance of a particular port.
Densities of movement data do not have to be
visualized necessarily as a raster map on top of a geo-
graphical map. Slingsby et al.24 deploy hierarchical,
interactive treemaps to explore spatio-temporal move-
ment patterns of couriers in London.
Clustering on urban data has been studied by Lu
et al.25,26 on taxi data. Lu et al.25 explore Origin
Destination (OD) pairs as an interactive selection of
clustered regions. The underlying summarization uses
a modified DBSCAN algorithm, which is a density-
based clustering algorithm. Lu et al.26 ranked trajec-
tories of taxi data based on their similarity of travel
time. Within their visual analytics tool, they visualized
the ranking as bands over time. Before ranking the tra-
jectories, they are mapped onto the underlying street
network first and then segmented.

and select stopovers. The density map (2) shows the spatial distribution of the selected moving entities. Within the
calendar view (3) the temporal distribution of the stopovers of the selected entities over time is visualized. The list of
gulls (4) shows the names and genders of the selected entities.
Konzack et al. 3
Slingsby and van Loon8 present an exploratory
visual analysis approach for animal movement data.
They applied it, as we did, on gull data, and they
devised ecological and visualization requirements on
the analytical process. Their visual encodings range
from point plots over density maps to tile maps and,
thus, cover partially our visualization techniques. The
visual analytics software consists of a central view, a
satellite map with an overlaid visual encoding and user
interactions, and two interconnected timelines: one for
a sequence of days and the other one on the times dur-
ing those days. They did not, however, consider a
summary and aggregation of the gulls' trajectories,
which we provide and use as the main technique to
interact with the user in our study.
Spretke et al.9 developed a visual analytics approach
for migrating seagulls. It supports interactive data
exploration and enrichment of movement data by add-
ing attributes dynamically from existing ones, and
incorporating weather information, such as wind and
temperature. They clustered the trajectories of gulls
into three states: day migration, night migration, and
stopover. They also segmented the trajectories based
on spatio-temporal characteristics (45 min resting and
less than 2 km continuous flight). Their visualization
with interconnected views lacks an abstraction for
visualizing clusters since Spretke et al.9 mapped the
clustering to only colors, and plotted the clusters as
plain data points yielding visual clutter.
Ko
¨lzsch et al.27 reflected on the visual design of
migrating birds by exploring different visualization
techniques to encode spatio-temporal characteristics
of migration. They related ecological research ques-
tions to the visual design which inspired us to link our
ecological research questions to the requirements of
our visual design.
Problem definition and requirement
analysis
Animal migration is an intriguing phenomenon in
nature and has, as a consequence, always received
much attention as a research topic in biology. It is
increasingly being studied through visual and quanti-
tative techniques due to the availability of tracking
data in combination with relevant environmental data
layers.8,12,28,29
In our study, we focus on the interactive analysis of
animal migration tracks, and in this section, we lay out
a number of important ecological research questions
that can be partially answered through these means.
By relating those domain research questions to analyti-
cal requirements, we aim for a holistic problem analy-
sis30 of migratory animal movement.
Ecological research questions on migration
patterns
Even though there is a large body of knowledge about
bird migration31,32 and some common principles are
generally recognized (a migrating organism would
maximize its fitness behaviorally by minimizing energy
consumption, time expenditure, or the risk incurred
during migration),33­35 our understanding of underly-
ing drivers as well as the (behavioral, ecological, and
physiological) mechanisms is still far from complete.
In the case of the focal species in this study (the
Lesser Black-backed Gull), for instance, exact energy
budgets are unknown, the comparative advantage of
migration (vs overwintering in the breeding area) is
unclear, and the reason for the wide spread in overwin-
tering sites by individuals from a single colony is also
unknown.36 However, some aspects of the migration
of this species have been studied, leading, for example,
to the conclusion that it minimizes the energetic costs
rather than time spent during migration.28
In this study, we explore how an interactive analysis
of trajectory data can help to gain more insight in the
possible role of individual differences, sex, and time-
dependent conditions (such as weather patterns or
ephemeral food resources) as well as the characteristics
of stopover sites during migration. The ecological
questions that we consider are listed in Table 1. They
have been designed to cover insights into a summary of
stopovers and the exploration of the relation between
trajectories and the actual movement.
Questions E1 to E3 focus on the relation between
attributes of the movement tracks (that can be consid-
ered as predictor variables) and migration decisions
(that can be considered as response variables).
However, both the predictor and response variables
have not been operationalized, so that inferential test-
ing through, for example, multiple regression is not
feasible yet. Rather, an explorative analysis is required
to help to define those variables.
Questions E4 to E6 deal with the uniqueness of
stopover sites. For these questions, the reference (e.g.
direct surroundings, other individuals) is not clearly
defined, hence part of the challenge is here to discover
the type and scale of reference that is meaningful.
Requirements for analysis tasks
We now map these ecological research questions to
more abstracts requirements that our approach needs
to support. These requirements are listed in Table 2.
Moreover, they help abstracting generic tasks from
spatio-temporal characteristics of migratory trajectory
data.

In our approach, we want to identify spatial patterns
(T1). This requirement covers a comprehensive visua-
lization of all trajectories, allowing the user to under-
stand and compare spatial patterns in migration (E1)
across different scales. A grouping of gulls with similar
movements provides insights into different categories
of migration behaviors (E6). A sequence of stops from
an origin to a destination (E5) can be expressed as
such a grouping. The behavior of individuals should
be distinguishable from overall group patterns to inves-
tigate how the migration strategy of an individual devi-
ates from the group movements (E6).
We want to identify temporal patterns (T2) across sev-
eral scales, ranging from day/night patterns over days
to seasonal patterns. A visualization should allow to
specify an episode to constrain the selection to lie
within a start and end date (E4, E5, E6).
Another analytical requirement is to identify stop-
overs (T3). This requirement deals with a more aggre-
gate view on the data to identify important or often
used places (E2) where migrating gulls come together
(E6). Stopovers can also be considered at the level of
an individual to visualize its migration strategy on top
of an exchangeable map, such as a geographic or a
topographic map, to investigate the surroundings of a
stopover (E4) with different visual cues. A visualiza-
tion should furthermore provide insight into the prox-
imity of the stopover. Statistics on a stopover help to
understand the nature of the stopover (E2).
Within our analytical framework, we want to com-
pare groups and individuals (T4). This requirement con-
cerns grouping individuals that show similar migration
strategies (E1), for example, travel mostly along a
coastline, over land, or over sea. A visualization should
enable not only a visual linkage between these groups
(E5) but also the comparison of one or more individu-
als with a group (E6). Subgroups can be selected by
the user individually or by characteristics of the gulls,
such as gender (E1, E2, E3).
Visual analytics approach
Our visual analytics approach (see Figure 1) enables
users to explore migration patterns interactively. We
identify stopovers, and aggregate them in a visualiza-
tion, so that the user can investigate and interact with
stopovers. The tool allows the user to select a sequence
of stopovers from an origin to a destination. Such a
selection imposes a direction of movement for moving
entities within a migration. The selected group of mov-
ing entities is rendered in the density map, the calendar
view, and the list of gulls. In the density map, the spa-
tial usage of the selected gulls is shown while the calen-
dar displays the counts of stopovers per day of selected
or all stopovers. The geographic maps for the density
map and the stopover aggregation are interconnected.
Our visual analytics approach is implemented as an
interactive website (http://www.win.tue.nl~kbuchin/
proj/gullmigration/), so that it is widely accessible to
researchers who want to explore migration patterns.
By visually exploring a data set, trust into the knowl-
edge base of the data set can be built,5 and it allows
ecologists to focus on data analysis instead of imple-
menting source code to isolate groups with different
migration behaviors.9
In this section, we first discuss the algorithmic tech-
niques which underlie our visual analytics tool and
relate these to the requirements of our tool.

Subsequently, we link the requirements to the visuali-
zation design.
Computational methods
To allow a clustering across different spatial scales
(T1), we have applied a single-linkage agglomerative
clustering to aggregate stopovers. Since gulls have
along their migration routes frequent stops which are
heterogeneous in duration and local detours, we can-
not readily apply stopover criteria used in existing
algorithms12 for segmenting the trajectories. Our algo-
rithm supports two parameters to facilitate flexible
stopover definitions. These parameters are thresholds
on the speed of a point to its successor within a trajec-
tory, defaulted to 3:5 km=h, and a maximum distance
between two moving entities, defaulted to 500 m. The
distance threshold determines whether two points
from distinct trajectories are within the same stopover.
Our chosen defaults provide sensible parameters to
describe stopover criteria for gulls.
In Figure 2 we show the aggregation algorithm that
we employed; it has four phases. The first two phases
focus on identifying stopovers (T3), and phases (3)
and (4) exploit spatio-temporal characteristics of
migration (T1, T2). The first three phases are exe-
cuted sequentially. After that, phase four is executed
for different spatial scales. We discuss each phase in
more detail in the following.
First, we classify points as idle if the speed of a point
with respect to the previous point of the trajectory of
an individual is below the given threshold. This allows
us to distinguish between movement and non-
movement of an individual.
Next, we compute stopovers (T3) by employing
Ritter's Bounding Sphere algorithm37 onto the idle
points and thresholding the distance between two idle
points. A stop is the smallest disk containing idle
points (Figure 2 shows five idle points that together
define a stop). Ritter's algorithm, with a running time
of O(nd) in general for n points in d dimensions, is
exceptionally efficient with a linear running time in
our case, since we compute the sphere in the plane
and n points at a stop. A drawback of this algorithm is
that the obtained disk is approximately 5% larger than
the optimal minimum-radius circle. By identifying
these stops, we are able to represent them as a visual
abstraction.
In the third phase, we take the centers of all disks,
which represent stopovers of idle points, and compute
a Delaunay triangulation38 on those centers. Because
a Delaunay triangulation minimizes the minimum
angle within the triangulation, that is, avoiding narrow
triangles, it is a suitable means to compute all possible
edges between stopovers.
Finally, to aggregate the stops, we perform a single-
linkage clustering by applying Kruskal's algorithm39
on the Delaunay triangulation from fine to coarse scale
(T1), where the distances between the corresponding
stops--disks--serve as edge weights. We span an edge
uv between the centers of the smallest enclosing balls
at u and v only for the moving entities incident to this
edge. We exclude in this computation those individu-
als who are not traveling along that edge uv. This step
allows us to construct a summary of the stopovers that
reduces visual clutter across multiple spatial scales.
The density map is dynamically computed on a set
of gulls and allows comparisons between different
groups (T4). The computation of a density map con-
sists in our approach of three steps: first, we interpolate
the data linearly for each individual, using a sample
resolution of 15 min to bypass irregular sample
Figure 2. The computational process to aggregate stopovers consists of four phases: (1) the identification of idle points,
(2) the computation of stops, (3) the triangulation of stops, and (4) the aggregation of stopovers on various scales. The
first two phases identify stopovers (T3). The resulting triangulation from phase (3) is used in phase (4) to compute
summaries on different spatial scales from fine to coarse (T1).

intervals. Then, we bin the counts for each individual
on a grid of all possible locations. The counts of a cell
are the occurrences of all moving entities with that grid
cell. Eventually, we discretize the binned values to five
quintiles (see Figure 3) and compute the contour lines
of the density map. Such a density map allows users to
perceive the distribution and the spatial extent of the
trajectories (T1).
As we are interested in investigating day and night
patterns of trajectories (T2), we need to classify sub-
trajectories as daytime or nighttime. To determine
whether a data point of a trajectory, given as longi-
tude, latitude, and a time stamp, occurs during day,
night, or twilight, we used the method described in
Forsythe et al.40 It is robust across the latitude, and
the computational error ranges from maximum 1 min
near the equator up to 2 min near 60° north latitude.
Visualization techniques
The stopover aggregation (T3) provides an overview
of the stopovers and the segmented trajectories, mov-
ing among the stopovers. We represent each stopover
as a disk, of which the radii encode the quantiles on
the number of trajectories at the stopover. This encod-
ing allows us to visualize the spatial distribution of the
stops within a stopover. The selected stopovers have
an orange halo, and the number indicates the sequen-
tial ordering of the stopovers from an origin to a desti-
nation (see Figure 1). Edges are colored in a light
shade of gray per default without any selection. The
more moving entities of the selection travel along an
edge, the stronger it will be saturated in a darker shade
of gray. Our encoding enables users to have a visually
salient selection.
To change the spatial layout of the stopover aggrega-
tion from coarse-grained to fine-grained (T1), we allow
the user to select an aggregation level (see phase four in
section `Computational methods') by providing a slider,
which is only visible if no selection has been made. The
map type can be changed to a satellite view (see Figure
4) to investigate the vicinity of the stopover (T3), as it is
provided by other state-of-the-art map services.
The density map provides an overview of the spatial
usage of a set of moving entities or all of them (T1).
We ensure that individual trajectories that deviate sub-
stantially from others are clearly visible using an appro-
priate kernel size. This way, the density map also
supports task T4. As for the stopover aggregation, the
map type can be changed to a satellite view as well
(T3).
To investigate the migration strategy of an individ-
ual, we provide a trajectory visualization. The trajec-
tory is drawn on top of the density map (Figure 4).
Day, night, and twilight are color coded in light blue,
black, and purple (T2), respectively. This allows a user
to see whether a gull travels long or short periods on a
particular day and also how many days the entire jour-
ney takes. The text labels on top of the trajectory show
the stopovers of an individual and can be turned off
and on. They indicate the sequence and the direction
of the movement for an individual.
The calendar view is shown when a stopover, a set
of gulls, or an individual gull has been selected (T4).
It provides information on the distribution of stops at
each day and which gulls stopped at a specific day
(T2). Such temporal information can be encoded in
various ways, such as a timeline or a punch card chart.
A calendar has the advantage of showing multiple
years at the same time. Our tool allows users to toggle
between showing the distribution of the selected stop-
overs or of all stopovers. The number of stops are
visualized in the same saturated scale of blue as the
one used in the stopover aggregation. Selecting a time
frame within the calendar helps to exploit temporal
patterns (T2), and such a selection is visualized as a
contour in the same shade of orange as the one used
for the selection in the stopover aggregation (see
Figure 6).

the individual gull, Sanne, shows considerable movement

After evaluating the metadata of the used data set,41
we focused on visualizing only names and gender of
the gulls in addition to their trajectories because the
ancillary data did not provide any pertinent statistics
(categorical and numerical) beyond gender and name.
The gulls within the selection are alphabetically sorted
by the names of the gulls. Males are colored in blue
and females in red. Subselections of previous selec-
tions are supported in various ways (T4).
Exploratory analysis process
Our visual analytics tool provides two ways to explore
migration: analyzing migration patterns at a level of
stopovers and investigating the spatio-temporal char-
acteristics of a single moving entity. Within the more
comprehensive analytical process in exploring stop-
overs, we support at any time the inspection of an
individual.
The analysis process for exploring stopovers is the
following:
1. Spot interesting stopovers;
2. Select a promising stopover;
3. Investigate the selected stopover(s);
4. Refine the selected stopover(s);
5. Inspect the individual trajectories of the result set.
Users start by attaining a general overview of the
data set by zooming, panning, and inspecting the inter-
connected maps. By hovering on interesting stopovers
(see Figure 5(a)), users gain insight on the structure
and the relevance of the stopovers (step 1).
Next, users select a stopover of their interest by
clicking on it (step 2). This will update all other views:
the density map, the calendar, and the list of gulls.
Subsequently, users explore the nature of the selec-
tion (step 3). Within the calendar view, users can tog-
gle between showing the counts of all stopovers or only
the selected ones. By hovering a day in the calendar, a
tooltip (Figure 5(b)) is shown with the names of the
gulls stopping at that day. Alternatively, the inspection
process on a single gull can help to gain insights here,
too (step 5).
The current selection of stopover(s) may be incom-
plete or inconclusive, so users can refine the selected
stopover(s) (step 4). By adding another stopover to
the selection, users define a sequence from an origin,
the first selected stopover, to a destination, the most
recently selected stopover. In the stopover aggregation
(2) of Figure 1, we show a stopover sequence from
Spain/Portugal to the Netherlands/Belgium. A dese-
lection of stopovers is supported and restricting the
selection to a specific gender is supported too, so that
users can investigate gender-specific differences (see
Figure 7). Using the slider for the aggregation level,
users are able to adjust the granularity of the stopover
aggregation.
Additionally, users can define a time range wherein
the sequence of stopovers must lie (see Figure 6). This
imposes a temporal restriction in which each individual
within the selection must have at least one sequence of
stopovers matching to the selection sequence, a stopover
at the origin after or during the start date of the time
frame, and a stopover at the destination before or dur-
ing the end date of the time frame. On a single stopover
selection, the origin and the destination then coincide.
It is also possible to define a subgroup manually
from the current selected entities. The users apply
steps 3 and 4 until they are satisfied with their find-
ings. Eventually, they discern the individual trajec-
tories from the result set of moving entities (step 5).
The analytical process to inspect a trajectory of a
single moving entity is defined by selecting the individ-
ual first and investigating the movements of the trajec-
tory on top of the density map. The visual encoding
can be altered to exploit geographical characteristics
and stopovers along the trajectory.
Evaluation
To assess the effectiveness of our visual analytics tool
in terms of strengths and weaknesses, we applied it to a
data set of migrating gulls over a period of 3 years and
evaluated the visual analytics tool by interviewing an
expert user in a 2-h session.
Our domain expert (one of the co-authors) has a
background in ecology and studied bird migration in
the past. He has seen a previous prototype of our

approach, but he did not experiment with the visual
analytics tool nor did he study the used data set
beforehand.
We conducted the evaluation with the expert user
in three phases. First, we gave instructions and expla-
nations on the visual design, the user interaction, the
computation of stopovers, and the analytical features.
This phase took 25 min. After that, we dealt with spe-
cific analytical questions on the data set. We developed
a catalog of analytical tasks, see Table 3, covering dif-
ferent facets of the tool and linking ecological research
questions and the requirements for our approach, see
Tables 1 and 2 in section ``Problem definition and
requirement analysis.'' In the final phase, we asked to
apply our tool on an area of interest and then asked
questions on the usability of the tool. Those reflections
will serve as a discussion of our approach.
Data set of migrating gulls
The Lesser Black-backed Gull is an interesting and
challenging species to analyze, since it has a broad diet
and can feed on many resources (both terrestrial and
marine), can fly efficiently in many weather conditions,
and can rest on both land and sea. As a consequence,
migration can take place across almost any landscape,
and foraging is possible almost anywhere along its
migration route. This species generally adopts a fly-
forage migration strategy which avoids carrying loads
but switches frequently between flying and feeding
instead.28
We applied our visual analytics tool to a comprehen-
sive data set collected by Stienen et al.,41 investigating
our ecological research questions on the Lesser Black-
backed Gull. Stienen et al.41 collected almost 2.5 mil-
lion data points from 101 gulls. This data set is unique
with respect to other gull data sets, since in other data
sets only 10­20 individuals were tracked over two to
three seasons in a coarse resolution, whereas individu-
als in this data set were tracked over 3 years in a much
higher resolution. The gulls have been tracked for at
least 10 days, and more than half of the gulls had loca-
tions for more than 100 days. This data set contains
75 Lesser Black-backed Gulls and 26 Herring Gulls.
Since the Herring Gulls stayed at their breeding site,
we have focused on the Lesser Black-backed Gulls in
Figure 6. A selected time range from October to November within the calendar view at a stopover.

and Dutch coast, and during autumn the Lesser
Black-backed Gulls migrated to the South of Spain,
Portugal, and North Africa. Further details about the
data set and the ecological studies that it supports are
provided in Stienen et al.41
Expert user evaluation
All analytical tasks (see Table 3) were completed suc-
cessfully. The ecologist completed most of the tasks
within 2­5 min. However, A5 consumed 9 min in
total, since this task heavily relied on several inspection
processes and contemplating on the meaning of ``inter-
esting movements during nighttime.''
We discuss the analytical tasks sequentially from top
to bottom and elaborate on the differences in solving
similar tasks as well.
To accomplish A1, the expert user inspected first
different aggregation levels (T1) and zoomed at differ-
ent levels within the stopover aggregation visualization.
Next, he investigated the whole map by hovering sev-
eral stopovers (E4, T3). Eventually, he identified the
stopover in North of Spain and Portugal as a stopover
with many gulls.
A3 and A7 are similar tasks to A1, but the expert
user did not use the aggregation slider. In A3, the user
browsed over a couple of stopovers (E4) and spotted
three stopovers in Brittany (North France) where only
female gulls stayed (E2, T4). The expert user instantly
recalled the stopovers from A3 in A7 and started to
hover on several stopovers (E2, E4) until he found
suitable stopovers in Brittany, England, and other
parts of France, where more females than males
stopped. He implicitly assumed there might be stops
where there are more males than females (compare
Figure 7).
To solve A2, the user directly selected the singleton
stopover in England and noted that there are multiple
stopovers in North Africa (E4). He used the slider for
the aggregation level after that until there was only one
stopover in North Africa left and selected this one as a
destination (E5). Subsequently, the domain expert
inspected the individual trajectories of the selection
using this route (T1, T4).
A4 differs from A2 by adding a temporal constraint
(E3, T2) on an origin-destination selection (E5). The
domain expert wanted to use the aggregation slider
similarly as in A2 for Brittany, but he did not find a
unique way, since, if the clustering is too coarse, there
is no stopover in England, and, if it is too fine, there
are many stopovers in Brittany. The expert user
accepted this trade-off and selected a sequence from
England to the largest stopover in Brittany (T1). Next,
he restricted the time frame within the calendar
appropriately (T2), enumerated the gulls Harry and
Sanne, and expressed that he wanted to select a
region, Brittany as such, since he thought that he
might miss some birds from other stopovers in
Brittany. In A8, he shared the same desire to select a
region after selecting yet another origin-destination
pair, over an intermediate stopover in this case. Thus,
a weakness of our approach is that we do not support a
selection of a region.
Within A5, finding a gull with interesting move-
ments during nighttime (E1), the user investigated at
first the complete list of gulls by hovering them (T4).
He was surprised that he could not see long trajec-
tories sometimes. After discovering that half of the
gulls stayed at the breeding spot, he wanted to select
all gulls from all stopovers excluding the breeding spot
(E5, T4) to investigate night movements outside of the
breeding spot, since he presumed that those motions
at the breeding spot are probably due to human inter-
ference. He moved through the list of gulls further,
while noticing that selecting a stopover (T3) might be
more effective, until he found gull Angel with a suitable
long trajectory (E1) (see Figure 8). Then, he defined
``interesting'' in this context as distinctively different
patterns in travel duration, speed, or trajectory shape
between a series of consecutive days and nights (E5).
He assumed implicitly that gulls can float on the
sea and be moved by tidal forces, as known from the
Figure 7. Density maps for (a) females and (b) males
reveal that females stop more often in Brittany, the most
northwestern part of France, than males and that males
tend to take larger detours during migration along the sea.

literature.8,29 So these patterns were not considered as
interesting per se, only when occurring at a different
rate during day and night.
We classified the locations of a trajectory based on
the time stamps and the corresponding geographical
position as twilight, daytime, or nighttime (see section
``Computational methods'') and visualized this on the
trajectory. So the visualization tool does not provide
direct information about the actual duration of daytime
and nighttime periods for a given date. In order to com-
pare trajectory lengths between day and night straight-
forwardly, the domain expert sought for periods around
equinox, since daytime and nighttime are then almost
equally distributed (based on this the ecologist did, for
example, skip a stopover of Angel in November, since
then the nighttime is longer). He switched to another
individual, Eric, subsequently, and zoomed out to get
an overview of the overall movements (E1). After some
panning and zooming, he found interesting that Eric, as
many others, traveled as much during the day as during
the night. He hypothesized that there might always be
light at the landmarks available to navigate.
While the trajectories of Angel and Eric (see
Figure 8) do not show much difference between the
lengths of day/night stretches, there are enormous dif-
ferences in the lengths of the tracks between Angel
and Eric. This poses whether Angel is coping with
adverse wind conditions (during the segment with
short distances per day/night) while Eric would have
strong wind support.
In A6, the user investigated the coastline of the
Atlantic ocean and selected the stopover covering this
area in South France. After wondering whether he
missed some gulls within the selection, he inspected
the individual gulls (E6, T4). The domain expert dis-
tinguished between gulls traveling up north at the
coastline, Anke, Sjarel, and Hilbran, southwards,
Roxanne and Jasmin (partially), in both directions,
Lea, or not all, Joke and Ian. To investigate the migra-
tion of gull Marie, a partial coastline migration, he
needed to zoom further to obtain a higher resolution
for the text labels of the stopovers. He wondered
whether he covered all of them, and hovered and
selected other stopovers south of the previous selection
(T3). Eventually, he noticed that those gulls are a sub-
set of the previously analyzed gulls.
A9 and A10 dealt with migration strategies at spe-
cific locations (E1), Madrid, and Gibraltar. To obtain
a more detailed aggregation, the domain expert used
the slider in A9 first. Then, he noted movements
within the density map in Madrid, and selected the
stopover at Madrid, enumerated Joke, Lea, and
Michelle, and noticed that only females visited the
stopover (E2, T4). The expert defined a migration
strategy for a group or an individual by identifying the
most southern stopover during their/its migration
(E5). By inspecting the individual trajectories, he
traced that Madrid was the most southern stopover for
Joke during the migration. Lea, in contrast, visited a
more southern stopover and traveled a week later than
Joke. The ecologist noticed instantly that Michelle has
been recorded for 2 years and pursued different
migration strategies. At the stopover in Gibraltar
(A10), the expert user often switched between the
individual trajectories of Annelies and Ella, the gulls
stopping in Gibraltar, since he was interested whether
both were visiting England (E5). He summarized that
Annelies is migrating in a clockwise two-way migration
(E1), and Ella migrates a year later than Annelies, vis-
its England before migrating south (anticlockwise two-
way migration) (see Figure 9). Then, the ecologist
used date information within the green stopover of an
individual trajectory (T2) to accomplish this. He
remarked that both pursued a coastline migration, and
he assumed that gulls learn to shortcut during migra-
tion through experiences based on learned landmarks
and resources from previous visits at the coastline. In
ecology, it is commonly believed that bird species gain
a better navigation capacity over the years through
learning experiences of the past. Therefore, older birds
are assumed to have better navigation abilities.
The final analytical task A11 of describing the
migration pattern over France was driven by the user's
interest in whether a stopover is used in a spring or
Figure 8. Overview of the movements of gulls: (a) ``Angel''
and (b) ``Eric.'' Both show considerable movement at night
in France, Spain, and Portugal.

autumn migration. He reflected first on the meaning
of a migration pattern and defined it as how many
stops do the gulls make (E2) and at what time do they
stop (E3, T3). To accomplish this task, he selected the
largest stopover in Brittany and analyzed the temporal
distribution of the selection (T2) within the calendar
by toggling between showing the distribution of all
stopovers or at the selected one. The domain expert
concluded after investigating some other stopovers
(E4) that the majority of stopovers in France is used
during spring migration, such as the large stopover in
Brittany, and little during autumn migration. He
found this fact interesting because he assumed that the
gulls would use them in both directions.
Reflections
After the task-oriented questions, we asked the expert
user to apply the visual analytics tool on an area in
which he is interested. He chose the stopover in
England and wanted to know whether the visits to
England were during, after, or before the breeding sea-
son (E2). He zoomed into the area around England
and analyzed the movements within the density map
(E1). Using the aggregation slider, he obtained the fin-
est resolution of the clustering. Next, by toggling the
temporal distribution between all stopovers and at the
selected stopover, it became clear that the gulls visited
England after breeding (E2), see Figure 10. The ecol-
ogist was surprised that the gulls visited England
mainly in 2014. He hypothesized that this fact might
be weather related and depended on wind conditions
as well (E5). Using a temporal restriction from mid-
July to September, he found that the gulls Harry,
Jules, and Sanne were regular visitors of England. He
was surprised that these gulls visited England that
early (E3). The ecologist was also interested in investi-
gating the difference among the entities (E6) between
two time range selections. He used the tooltips within
the calendar heavily to perform this comparison.
After that, we asked the ecologist to elaborate his
reasoning behind the selection mechanisms. Regarding
origin-destination selections, he would not select more
than three stopovers at the same time, and he would
like to select regions only at a very aggregate level. In
particular, a gridded map to select areas of interest,
such as cities or agricultural regions, would be benefi-
cial to the expert user. This indicates that a hierarchical
clustering, as we employed it, is crucial to aggregate
stopovers dynamically on different spatial scales.
The time restriction within the calendar has been
used by the expert user to isolate yearly cycles, and it
was easy for him to identity pre-, post-, and peribreed-
ing visits in this way.
Then, we asked him to outline his workflow after find-
ing something of interest in our tool and to contemplate
on the purpose of our approach. The expert user saw our
approach as ``a visual data querying tool'' to generate sub-
sets of the data set. He would select individuals showing
a certain behavior and look at their space-time usage after
finding something of interest. Subsequently, he would
continue his research by computing some metrics, corre-
lations, and statistics on the selected individuals in R to
test a hypothesis on these groups. This confirms that our
approach helps ecologists to explore and identify migra-
tion patterns visually and interactively before they pro-
ceed with non-visual analytical tasks.
By exploiting spatio-temporal relations between
stopover sites, showing characteristics on a particular
stopover, and visualizing spatio-temporal properties of
an individual's trajectory in our tool, we enhance such
analytical tasks for ecologists from manually extraction
through custom prototyping--which would consume
several hours--to a visual user interaction that takes a
couple of minutes. Furthermore, an ecologist can
identify individuals with a certain migration strategy
and also infer migration routes of individuals36 at a
selected stopover site. Hence, our approach enables
ecologists to visualize movement data sets with many
movement tracks as well as individuals in the trajec-
tory aggregation and thus speeds up the inspection
process of discovering interesting stopover sites, indi-
viduals, or tracks drastically.

Conclusion
This study presents a novel approach to visually explore
migratory trajectory data. We computed an aggregation
of stopovers from those trajectories and the movements
between them in different spatial scales and visualized
it interactively together with a density map and a calen-
dar view. To investigate the tracks interactively, we
enable the user to select stopovers and add restrictions
on spatio-temporal properties of the selection. By
applying our approach to a data set of 75 migrating
Lesser Black-backed Gulls and by evaluating it with an
expert user, we validated our visual analytics tool.
Our findings show that this exploratory visual ana-
lytics tool supports ecologists to investigate research
questions on migration interactively. It especially
enhances the identification of (groups of) individuals
with a characteristic spatio-temporal migration beha-
vior, but also allows discovering stopover sites with
environmentally conditions which stand out.
As we used a single criterion on all stopover sites
and individuals within our clustering, we think it is
worthwhile to investigate varying rules per individual
and per region. This would help to enhance the aggre-
gation of stopovers to be more flexible.
As part of future work, we plan to integrate environ-
mental data, such as information on land use, weather
conditions (primarily wind), sea currents, and daylight,
to facilitate the spatial exploration in the context of rel-
evant variables.
