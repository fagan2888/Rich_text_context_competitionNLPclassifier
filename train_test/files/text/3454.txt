Introduction
Scholars of political ideology are increasingly interested in
adult attachment theory to understand better the role of ideol-
ogy in thought processes and behaviors from childhood to
adulthood (Fraley, Griffin, Belsky, & Roisman, 2012; Huddy,
Feldman, & Weber, 2007; Koleva & Rip, 2009). Different
attachment styles may condition different ideological world-
views (Buck, 2014; Roccato, Russo, & Senestro, 2013;
Thornhill & Fincher, 2007; Weber & Federico, 2007). Only a
few studies have examined the relationship of adult attach-
ment relational styles to ideology, mainly in college student
samples in the United States,1 and their results differ (Dunkel
& Decker, 2012; Gillath & Hart, 2010; Koleva & Rip, 2009;
Thornhill & Fincher, 2007; Weber & Federico, 2007; Weise
et al., 2008). The objective of the present research was to study
ideology and attachment in general population samples.
Ideological divisions have deepened in the United States
in the past 40 years, making it increasingly difficult for parti-
san groups to agree or compromise on policy and legislation
(Abramowitz, 2010;Abramowitz & Saunders, 2005; Gauchat,
2012). Well-educated citizens tend to be the most politically
involved and the most likely to identify with an ideological
stance (Abramowitz, 2010; Pew Research Center, 2016).
Among other factors contributing to the increasing ideologi-
cal impasse are intensifying differences among the genera-
tions (Pew Research Center, 2016) and increasing divides
between the highly religious and the nonreligious (Twenge,
Sherman, Exline, & Grubbs, 2016). Being religious is often
related to being conservative (Brossard, Scheufele, Kim, &
Lewenstein, 2009; Gauchat, 2012; Roccato, 2008). Another
factor is citizens'growing preferences for information sources
associated with an ideological orientation. Conservatives tend
to view mainstream news media with distrust and to prefer
outlets that share their views; liberals are disposed to trust
news media, particularly those perceived as congruent with
their positions (Center for Political Communication, 2012;
Diercks & Landreville, 2017; Gaziano, 2014; Hindman &
Yan, 2015; Jamieson & Cappella, 2009; Johansen & Joslyn,
2008; Lee, 2010; Morris, 2005).
The Current Research
The goal was to explore the relationship of attachment and
ideology in the context of variables identified as important to
trends shaping polarization: formal education, income, age,
religiosity, and trust in mass media. Adult attachment was
conceptualized as an independent variable because it derives
theoretically from infant attachment, a process occurring in
the first few years of life. Gender was also considered an
independent variable because it is determined before birth.

Adult Attachment Style and Political
Ideology
Cecilie Gaziano1
Abstract
Political polarization has intensified in the United States since the 1970s. The present research concerned adult attachment
style as a potential explanation for ideological divisions. Few studies have examined this, mainly in college student samples, and
their results conflict. The present research contributes to the literature because it is the first one to focus on the relationship
of adult attachment to ideology in general population samples. Ideology was measured by self-placement on a 7-point scale.
Attachment was measured by Carver's 14-item self-reported Measure of Attachment Qualities (MAQ). Structural equation
models were estimated for path analyses. The results for the direct effect of secure attachment style on ideology were
mixed and indicated that both liberals and conservatives can have secure attachments. Results also underscored the potential
importance of higher socioeconomic status for secure relational attachment style. Higher religiosity and lower trust in mass
media contributed to conservatism.

The earliest relationships that humans know influence
their perceptions of power and authority (Ainsworth, Blehar,
Waters, & Wall, 1978; Barker & Tinnick, 2006; Feldman &
Stenner, 1997; Grossman, Grossmann, & Waters, 2005;
Lakoff, 2002; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003). Political ideo-
logical orientations, in part, are based in attitudes toward
power and authorities.
Independent Variable: Attachment Theory
Infant attachment. Adult attachment conceptualizations build
on infant attachment theory, although there are many differ-
ences between these areas. Infant attachment is a process that
provides "internal working models" for relationships
throughout life and for development of cognitive skills, trust,
confidence, and motivation to learn as the child matures
(Bowlby, 1969/1982; de Ruiter & van IJzendoorn, 1993;
Fraley, 2002; Mikulincer, 1998).
The attachment process develops from the interaction pat-
tern of the primary caregiver and the infant and is defined by
how well the caregiver can respond to the emotional needs of
the infant. Parents who consistently provide comfort from
anxiety and distress tend to foster secure attachments in their
babies. Those parents who do not respond to their infants'
emotional needs with dependable regularity are likely to pro-
mote insecure attachments. Securely attached infants learn to
trust their caregiver as a safe base from which to explore
their world (Ainsworth, 1991; Sroufe & Waters, 1977).
Insecurely attached children have learned not to trust that
their caregiver will comfort their anxieties and provide
safety; they tend to feel powerless, have low self-esteem, and
approach relationships with trepidation.
Types of attachment. Attachments, therefore, may be secure or
insecure, and insecure attachments are divided into three
main categories: anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant (Ain-
sworth et al., 1978), and disorganized (Main & Solomon,
1986). The latter type has seldom been studied in adults and
is not discussed here. Ambivalence is characterized by hyper-
active attachment behavior in search of security: fear of aban-
donment, high anxiety, and desire to merge with other people
(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Cassidy & Kobak, 1988; Main,
1990). Carver (1997) further distinguished between two anx-
ious-ambivalent styles (ambivalent-worry, or tendency to
worry about loss, and ambivalent-merger, or desire for close-
ness). Avoidance involves lowering anxiety by deactivating
the attachment system, restricting close relationships and
emotional connections with others, relying on the self, and
seeking control over others (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998;
Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994; Mikulincer, 1998).
Research on adult attachment and ideology.Studies of adult
attachment as a psychological aspect of political ideology in
college students, either in experiments or surveys in the
United States, yield conflicting results (Dunkel & Decker,
2012; Gillath & Hart, 2010; Koleva & Rip, 2009; Thornhill
& Fincher, 2007; Weber & Federico, 2007; Weise et al.,
2008). Student samples diverge enough from nonstudent
samples in political interest and knowledge and other charac-
teristics that general population samples should be preferred
when studying such constructs (Koleva & Rip, 2009). Peter-
son (2001) also raised the question of differences found
between college student samples and the general population
in effect sizes and directionality.
Four student studies of adult attachment style and ideology
measured ideology as conservatism/liberalism (Dunkel &
Decker, 2012; Thornhill & Fincher, 2007; Weber & Federico,
2007; Weise et al., 2008). Three also included social domi-
nance orientation (SDO) and/or right-wing authoritarianism
(RWA), concepts not part of the present research (Thornhill &
Fincher, 2007; Weber & Federico, 2007; Weise et al., 2008).
A fifth inquiry into these relationships (Gillath & Hart, 2010)
looked solely at priming effects, and two analyses (Weber &
Federico, 2007; Weise et al., 2008) included primes as part of
their research. Primes were unrelated to liberalism/conserva-
tivism and are not discussed further. Dunkel and Decker
(2012) found that ambivalent and avoidant attachments were
related to liberalism, and Thornhill and Fincher (2007)
observed that secure attachments were associated with an
indicator of conservatism, C-Scale scores. In contrast, Weise
et al. (2008) reported that security of attachment was associ-
ated with liberal ideology. Weber and Federico (2007)
reported a significant positive indirect effect of anxious
attachment on left-right placement (a scale combining ideol-
ogy and partisanship, where high scores indicated greater
conservativism/Republicanism), through RWA and a ten-
dency to view the world as dangerous.
Measurement of adult attachment. The student studies varied
in how they operationalized attachment. Two relied on the
Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ; Dunkel & Decker,
2012; Thornhill & Fincher, 2007), one used the Experiences
in Close Relationships (ECR) measure (Weber & Federico,
2007), and one used the Relationship Scales Questionnaire
(RSQ; Weise et al., 2008).
The current study used another gauge, the Measure of
Attachment Qualities (MAQ; Carver, 1997), selected as the
most appropriate measure in a general population survey
because it is much shorter than the RSQ or ECR and a little
shorter than the AAQ. Brevity was important because the
questionnaires were limited to 50 questions. It has been used
effectively in previous research (Carver, 1997; Hollist &
Miller, 2005; Kim & Carver, 2007; Kim, Carver, Deci, &
Kasser, 2008; Roccato, 2008; Roccato & Ricolfi, 2005;
Roccato et al., 2013; Segal, Needham, & Coolidge, 2009).
Dependent Variable: Ideology
Jost (2006) defined ideology, following Tedin (1987), as "an
interrelated set of moral and political attitudes" that organize
Gaziano 3
people's values and beliefs, guide and explain political behav-
ior, and are relatively stable over time (p. 653). Conservatives
tend to support traditional attitudes and values, maintain cau-
tion in innovation or change, and emphasize respect for
authority, obedience, and self-discipline in child-rearing.
Liberals tend to be more open to social and political change,
to support social equality, and to favor self-fulfillment, empa-
thy, and nurturance in child-rearing (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski,
& Sulloway, 2003a; Koleva & Rip, 2009; Lakoff, 2002).2
The present research concerns a liberal­conservative scale
of political views that has been a staple of American public
opinion polls and related research. The majority of studies of
adult attachment relational style and ideology analyzed by
Koleva and Rip (2009) measured ideology on a unidimensional
scale anchored at each end by liberalism and conservatism.
Various scales measure ideological dimensions, such as
RWA (Altemeyer, 1981, 1998), and SDO (Sidanius & Pratto,
1999). According to Jost (2006), however,
Most treatments of political ideology have focused on the left­
right (or, especially in the United States, the liberalism­
conservatism) distinction (Jost et al.,2003a, 2003b; Knight,
1990). . . Although the left­right distinction is by no means
airtight, it has been the single most useful and parsimonious way
to classify political attitudes for more than 200 years. (p. 654)
A check of questions measuring political ideology during the
past 40 years or more used by major organizations such as
the American National Election Studies (ANES), the
National Opinion Research Center, the Pew Research Center,
and the Roper Center supports this conclusion.
Research Question 1: Is adult attachment a predictor of
political ideology in a general population sample?
Intervening Variables
Variables that may influence the relationship between attach-
ment and ideology were measured. These included trust in
mass media reporting, two other related types of trust, interest
in news and public affairs, religiosity, and demographics.
Trust in mass media and other trust.Three types of trust
appear in much political and mass communication research:
trust in media to report news accurately and fairly, trust in
people, and trust in government to act fairly and democrati-
cally. Trust in people and trust in government are vital ante-
cedents to political participation (Moy & Scheufele, 2000).
If social segments and news media are segregated ideologi-
cally, then media distrust impedes the political process
because widespread publication of news is essential in a
democratic society (Jones, 2004).
Public affairs interest.This variable was included in initial
analyses because attachment in infants sets the course for
interest in new experiences and ideas, deriving from a sense
of agency and competence (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Suess,
Grossmann, & Sroufe, 1992). It may also be connected to
adults' interest in public affairs. Public affairs interest is
related to political knowledge and participation (Eveland &
Scheufele, 2000; Gaziano, 1997; Liu & Eveland, 2005;
Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996).
Religiosity. Several studies demonstrate that people compre-
hend complicated or controversial issues such as abortion or
global warming using their value predispositions, many of
which tend to be religious values or heuristic cues from news
media, religious institutions, political elites, and other
sources (Brossard et al., 2009; Diercks & Landreville, 2017;
Hindman, 2009; Ho, Brossard, & Scheufele, 2008). Many
researchers operationalize religiosity as evaluation of the
importance of religion in respondents' lives and their fre-
quency of attending religious services (Brossard et al., 2009;
Gauchat, 2012; Ho et al., 2008; Malka & Lelkes, 2010; Roc-
cato, 2008; Roccato & Ricolfi, 2005).
Demographics. Education, in particular, as well as household
income, age, gender, and race are indicators of ideological
divides (Abramowitz, 2010; Diercks & Landreville, 2017;
Gauchat, 2012; Gaziano, 2013, 2014, 2017; Hindman, 2009,
2012; Hindman & Yan, 2015; Pew Research Center, 2016;
Veenstra, Hossain, & Lyons, 2014).
Research Question 2: Which other variables are related
to adult attachment, and how are they related to each
other?
Study 1
Method
Participants. A random national general population sample in
the United States (N = 330) was obtained from SurveyMon-
key at www.surveymonkey.com between September 27 and
October 1, 2013. The response rate was 35.1% of individuals
invited to participate. The 50-question survey, "Opinions
About Topics in the News, Interpersonal, and Social Issues,"
took about 10 min to complete. Two additional samples were
drawn in 2014 and are reported later. SurveyMonkey is an
online survey site that maintains a large, diverse, national
panel of people who have completed a profile survey and
have agreed to respond to surveys commissioned by Survey-
Monkey customers. The company reports that it maintains
regular benchmarking surveys to help ensure that panel mem-
bers are representative of the population. SurveyMonkey
audiences do not receive money. They receive credits toward
donations to charitable organizations and sweepstakes entries.
SurveyMonkey removes any information identifying respon-
dents before the data are given to investigators. Advantages
of an Internet survey are cost-effectiveness and speed.

Disadvantages are that American adults with Internet access
tend to be of higher socioeconomic status (SES) than those
who lack access and may be different in other ways from non-
Internet samples (see, for example, Zickuhr & Rainie, 2013).
Independent variables
Adult attachment. The MAQ is a self-report measure of
adult attachment containing 14 items with four Likert-type
categories, ranging from "disagree with the statement a lot"
to "agree with the statement a lot" (Carver, 1997; Kim &
Carver, 2007). Four subscales containing three to five items
assess secure, avoidant, ambivalent-worry, and ambivalent-
merger patterns. Examples of items are "It feels relaxing
and good to be close to someone" and "I prefer not to be
too close to others."3 Responses to the four subscales were
summed according to Carver's directions. The subscales
had adequate internal consistency: security,  = .71; avoid-
ant,  = .80; ambivalent-worry,  = .77; and ambivalent-
merger,  = .75. Summary statistics for variables are in the
appendix. Because the numbers of statements for each type
of attachment were unequal, responses were averaged.
Gender. This is described under "Demographics" section
below.
Dependent variable: Ideology. Respondents were asked, "Here
is a 7-point scale on which the political views that people
might hold are arranged from extremely liberal to extremely
conservative. Where would you place yourself on this scale?"
Participants also were asked which political party described
their views the best on a 7-point scale ranging from "strong
Republican" to "strong Democrat," recoded so that high
meant strong Republican; however, party identification was
not used in the present analysis because it was highly corre-
lated with ideology (r = .70, p < .001).
Intervening variables
Trust in government, media, and people.The questions
were (a) "How much of the time do you think you can trust
the federal government in Washington to make decisions in
a fair way?" (b) "How much of the time do you think you
can trust the media to report the news fairly?" (c) "Gener-
ally speaking, how often can you trust other people?" The
questions used 5-point scales and were separated in the ques-
tionnaire. Answer categories were always, most of the time,
about half the time, once in a while, and never (recoded so
that high scores denoted high trust).
Interest in public affairs. People were asked how interested
they were in what was going on in government and public
affairs on a 5-point scale anchored by "extremely interested"
and "not interested at all" (recoded so that high scores signi-
fied high interest).
Religiosity. Participants rated the importance of religion in
their lives and their frequency of attending religious services
on 5-point scales. The end points were "extremely important"
and "not important at all" for the first measure and "every
week" to "never" for the second. Responses were combined
to form a religiosity score, averaged, and recoded so that high
scores meant highly religious (Cronbach's  = .86).
Demographics. Participants were asked the year they were
born, the last grade they completed in school, household
income, gender, and race. Age was measured as continuous,
and the others were measured as categories. Compared with
census data (Table 1), the sample overrepresented women,
the middle-aged, and people with higher education and
household incomes. Minority racial groups were not well
represented, and race was discarded from additional analy-
sis. A t-test comparison of the sample mean and the mean of
a sample from the ANES4 in 2012 using the identical ques-
tion about ideology showed that the present study signifi-
cantly overrepresented liberals (t = 3.95, df = 1,565, p < .001,
two-tailed). Table 1 shows two additional 2014 samples, to
be discussed later as Study 2.
Analytical method.Causal modeling with path analysis in a
structural equation model with maximum likelihood estima-
tion in AMOS 23.0 was selected to evaluate the potential
relationships with attachment and to estimate how well these
variables fit the model for each of the three samples. Path
analysis allows the consideration of both direct and indirect
effects of exogenous variables on dependent variables. Cau-
sality is inferred for gender and security of adult attachment,
the observed exogenous variables, as those variables precede
the others in time order. Observed endogenous variables
were trust in mass media to report news fairly, trust in the
government to make fair decisions, religiosity, public affairs
interest, respondents' age, education, household income, and
ideology. Unobserved exogenous variables were error vari-
ances that cause response variation in the observed endoge-
nous variables. Structural equation modeling permits
multiple pathways through intervening variables. Figure 1
presents the conceptual model.
Figures 2 to 4, below, report standardized regression coef-
ficients that attained statistical significance. Standardized
regression coefficients () range from +1.0 to -1.0 and allow
direct comparisons of the relative strength of each predictor
in a model and comparisons of results across the figures.
Study 1 Results
Table 2 provides the correlations among ideology, the four
attachment variables, religiosity, the three trust items, public
affairs interest, and three demographic variables. Among the
attachment measures, highest relationship was between secu-
rity and avoidance (negative) and between ambivalent-worry
and ambivalent-merger (positive). These results were similar
to previous reports (Carver, 1997; Kim & Carver, 2007; Kim
et al., 2008). Correlations among the other attachment vari-
ables were moderate. Security was significantly and
Gaziano 5
negatively related to ideology and was the only attachment
item retained for further analysis. (Worry was related to ideol-
ogy only at r = .10, p < .10, and initial testing in a path model
showed that the relationship decreased markedly when other
variables were taken into account.) Ideology was significantly
and positively correlated with religiosity and significantly
and negatively correlated with media trust and government
trust but unrelated to trust in people. Media trust was uncor-
related with religiosity, though it might have been expected to
be associated because Golan and Day (2010) reported mixed
evidence of a relationship in their investigation of media
credibility and religiosity. Public affairs interest was not
related to any of the other variables at .05 or less, and it was
discarded from further tests as was trust in people.
A structural equation model was estimated for hypothesis
testing in a path analysis in which attachment security and
gender were exogenous variables and were allowed to have
direct effects on religiosity, media trust, government trust,
age, education, household incomes, and ideology. Then reli-
giosity, trust in media reporting, trust in government, age,
education, and income were permitted to have direct effects
on ideology.
The resulting path model is given in Figure 2, showing
standardized coefficients. The model was a good fit to the
data: 2 = 18.866, 19 df, p = .465 (45 distinct sample moments,
26 distinct parameters to be estimated), N = 330, CMIN/df =
.993 (chi-square statistic that is the minimum value of the
discrepancy between the model and the data, divided by its
degrees of freedom), Bentler's comparative fit index (CFI) =
1.0, Tucker­Lewis Index (TLI) = 1.001, and the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .001. The criteria
considered desirable for goodness of fit statistics were the
following: a nonsignificant chi-square, RMSEA less than
.05, CFI and TLI of .95 or higher, and CMIN/df of less than
2 (Hox & Bechger, 1998; Hu & Bentler, 1995). The results fit
the hypothesized model well.
The first research question asked if adult attachment was
related to political ideology. Figure 2 shows that security of
attachment had a direct effect of  = ­.12 (p < .05) on ideol-
ogy. In addition, the standardized coefficient for an indirect
effect was  = ­.03, for a standardized total effect of  = ­.15.
The negative sign indicated that liberals were higher in secu-
rity than conservatives. The second research question con-
cerned which other variables were related to adult attachment

and how they might relate to each other. Secure attachment
also was a significant predictor of trust in media reporting
and possessing higher household incomes. Gender had no
direct effect on ideology, and its indirect effect was negligi-
ble. The only effect of gender was on household income,  =
­.12 (p < .05), indicating that men tended more than women
to have higher household incomes. Distrust of government
and distrust of media were significantly related to conserva-
tism, as were being older, less educated, and having higher
household incomes. Religiosity was a significant predictor of
conservative ideology at  = .40 (p < .001) and was the most
related to ideology, among all the variables.
Discussion
Inspired by a desire to untangle the relations between adult
attachment and ideology because of mixed results in previous
research, the present study sought to explore this relationship
in a general population sample. The primary finding was that
secure attachment was a significant predictor of liberal ideol-
ogy. No known previous research on ideological orientation
and attachment style has included media trust or government
trust. Secure adult attachment led to trust in media, and media
trust predicted liberalism. Security was not significantly
related to trust in government, but government trust was cor-
related with media trust and also predicted liberalism.
Importance of religion predicted conservatism, consonant
with other research (Gaziano, 2014). Religion was not a sig-
nificant predictor in Thornhill and Fincher's (2007) work,
but their operational definition of religiosity may have been
too simple to achieve predictive ability. It was a variable
coded as "1 = religion" and "0 = no religion."
Older age, lower education, and higher household incomes
also predicted conservatism. Previous research has found con-
servatives tending to have lower education than liberals but
tending to have higher household incomes than liberals (Diercks
& Landreville, 20175; Gaziano, 2014; Hindman & Yan, 2015).

ferent in ideology (t = 1.59, df = 551, p < .11, two-tailed).
The 2014 general population sample, however, was signifi-
cantly more liberal than the ANES 2012 general population
sample (t = 5.44, df = 1,458, p < .001, two-tailed).
Dependent variable:Ideology. Ten questions comprising an Ideo-
logical Consistency Scale (ICS) used by the Pew Research
Center (2014) were included as a check on the validity of the
7-point scale measuring ideology, and a high correlation
between them increased confidence in the liberal­conservative
scale. Respondents chose the one statement in a pair of state-
ments that came closer to their views, where one statement rep-
resented a conservative point of view, and one represented a
liberal stance. For example, "Government regulation of busi-
ness usually does more harm than good" (conservative) OR
"Government regulation of business is necessary to protect the
public interest" (liberal). Conservative responses were scored
"+1," and liberal responses were scored "­1." Don't know/
refused/volunteered responses counted as "0." Responses were
summed to form the scale (Cronbach's  = .78, general popula-
tion sample; .58, conservative sample). In the general popula-
tion sample, ideology and the ICS were highly related (r = .75,
p < .001), as were the ICS and party identification (r = .71, p <
.001), and ideology and partisanship (r = .77, p < .001).Among
the conservatives, results were r = .24, ICS and ideology; r =
.48, ICS and party identification; and r = .33, ideology and par-
tisanship, all significant at .001.
Independent variable: Adult attachment style.The measures of
security, avoidance, ambivalent-worry, and ambivalent-merger
were constructed as in Study 1. The internal consistency for the
general population sample was security,  = .68; avoidant,  =
.83; ambivalent-worry,  = .73; and ambivalent-merger,  =
.75, comparable with the 2013 results.Among the conservative
sample, results were, respectively, .73, .78, .70, and .75.

Intervening variables
Religiosity.The scale for religiosity was created as in
Study 1 with Cronbach's  = .88, general population sample,
and .78, conservative sample. The conservative sample sur-
passed the general population sample significantly in how
religious they were.
Media trust. The general population sample significantly
exceeded in trusting the media, compared with the conserva-
tive sample. Trust in the government to make good decisions
and trust in people were not asked in Study 2.
Demographics.As Table 1 shows, all the samples con-
siderably overrepresented higher SES groups. As with the
2013 sample, the two 2014 samples were significantly more
likely to be White and non-Hispanic than the general public.
Like the 2013 sample, the 2014 general population sample
slightly underrepresented men. The 2014 sample of conser-
vatives was significantly more likely to be male and older
than the 2014 and 2013 general population samples. Their
SES differences were not significant.
Study 2 Results
Tables 3 and 4 present the intercorrelations for the same mea-
sures as used in Study 1. Table 3 shows that in the 2014 gen-
eral population sample, security correlated inversely and
substantially with avoidance at ­.53 (p < .001), and security
was related to worry at .08 (ns) and merger at .16 (p < .05).
Avoidance was associated with worry and with merger both
Gaziano 9
at .20 (p < .01). Worry and merger correlated at .60 (p <
.001). In the 2014 conservative sample, results were similar,
except that security and worry correlated at ­.25 (p < .001)
and security and merger showed no significant relationship
(Table 4). Ideology and security were inversely related but
not significant in the general population sample. Contrary to
these results, in the conservative sample, ideology and secu-
rity were positively and significantly correlated.
Figure 3 illustrates the results of the path analysis in the
population at large in 2014, including the same variables as
in Figure 2, except for government trust. It had an adequate
model fit with 2 = 10.432, df = 12 (36 distinct sample
moments, 24 distinct parameters), p = .578, n = 223, CMIN/df
= .869, CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.027, RMSEA = .001. Although
the standardized direct effect of security on ideology was
­.024, the standardized indirect effect was ­.065 for a total
standardized effect of ­.089. Despite being small and not sig-
nificant, the direction of relationship mirrored that in the
2013 sample, that is, that security was related to liberalism.
Gender directly affected ideology in a significant negative
pattern, indicating that men were more conservative than
women. This result was not observed in Figure 2.
The patterns of the relationships of media trust, religios-
ity, age, and education to ideology were similar to those in
Study 1. Media trust was negatively related to conservative
ideology,  = ­.11 (but only p < .10), and religiosity was
positively correlated with conservative ideology,  = .41 (p <
.001). The direct effect of security of attachment on income
was similarly positive and significant,  = .13 (p < .05).
Security also directly affected education ( = .18, p < .01).
Age affected ideology as in Study 1, but only at p < .10.
Figure 4 depicts the results for the conservative sample.
The model achieved a satisfactory fit to the hypothesized
model with 2 = 6.758, df = 8 (21 distinct sample moments,
13 distinct parameters), p = .563, N = 202, CMIN/df = .845,
CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.08, and RMSEA = .001.
Here, secure style of attachment was directly, positively,
and significantly related to ideology ( = .14, p < .05), with
no indirect effect. The direction of this relationship was
opposite of that found in Figures 2 and 3. Security main-
tained the positive direction of effect on household income,
however,  = .18 (p < .01), consistent with results in Figures
2 and 3, but it had no direct effect on education as it had in
Figure 3 for the 2014 general population sample. Women
tended more than men to have faith in fairness of media
reporting, a pattern that did not occur in the other two sam-
ples. The conservative sample differed from the general pop-
ulation sample in 2014 in the lack of relationships between
security and media trust or between gender and ideology. It
was like the other two samples in the relation of low media
trust and high religiousness to conservatism.
Limitations
The Internet samples were of significantly higher SES and
differed somewhat in age from census data from the 2013
American Community Survey. The 2013 and 2014 general
population samples underrepresented men, and the 2014
conservative sample overrepresented men. Both of the gen-
eral population samples in 2013 and 2014 were significantly
more liberal than the 2012 ANES, although a third sample of
conservatives was drawn for balance. These differences
weaken the ability of this study to generalize to the popula-
tion at large. Ideally, the research should be repeated with
larger, more representative samples. Because the present
research and the four previous reports on college students'
ideology and attachment have been with samples in the
United States, such work should be carried out in other parts
of the globe among different kinds of populations.
In addition, ideology in the present research was measured
as self-placement on a single 7-point self-report item.Although
numerous polls and surveys have found this type of measure to
be reliable and valid, other measures of liberalism and conser-
vatism could be used for a more multidimensional examina-
tion of ideology. In 2014, results for ideology were compared
with a measure of ideological consistency known to be a valid
and reliable indicator of political philosophy over time (Pew

Research Center, 2014), increasing confidence that the self-
placement question is a justifiable gauge of political orienta-
tion. Interest in news of government and public affairs was not
a predictor, but it may have been too general. Interest levels
tended to be similarly high among liberals and conservatives
and lagged among independents. The relation of ideology and
interest in specific politically contested public affairs and sci-
ence issues could be investigated further.
Not including government trust in the 2014 studies can be
criticized as this variable was useful in the 2013 research. It
could be included in future work.
Discussion and Conclusion
Political polarization is of increasing concern in the United
States because it has intensified since the 1970s. The present
research concerned adult relational attachment style as a
potential contributor to ideological divisions. Only a few stud-
ies have examined this, primarily in college student samples,
and their results differ. The present research contributes to the
literature because it is the first one to focus on the relationship
of adult attachment to ideology in general population samples.
The main findings are as follows.
Study 1: General Population Sample
Liberals scored significantly higher than conservatives in
secure attachment relational style. Secure attachment was sig-
nificantly related to trust in media reporting and also to hav-
ing higher household incomes. As would be expected,
conservatives were significantly more likely than liberals to
be religious and to distrust both government and mass media.
Other significant predictors of conservatism were being older
and less educated but possessing higher household incomes.
Religiosity and media trust were uncorrelated. Gender, con-
ceptualized as an independent variable, made no difference in
ideology and was associated significantly only with house-
hold income, meaning that men had higher incomes.

Study 2: General Population Sample
Secure attachment was unrelated to ideology, although the
combined direct and indirect effects appeared similar to the
result in Study 1. The other independent variable, gender,
however, was significantly and negatively related to ideol-
ogy, meaning that men were more conservative than women.
Gender had no effects on other variables. Security was posi-
tively and significantly associated with education and
incomes. Conservatism was linked to lower trust in media
but only at p < .10. It was strongly related to religiosity, as
well as to lower education. There was a positive association
with age, only at p < .10. Again, religiosity and media trust
were unrelated.
Study 2: Conservative Sample
Secure attachment style was a significant and positive pre-
dictor of conservatism, contrary to the positive relationship
in Study 1 and the lack of significant relationship in the
Study 2 general population sample. As in Study 1 and Study
2 general population groups, security and household incomes
were positively and significantly correlated. Consistent with
the other two sample results, being religious was highly
related to conservatism. Also congruent with the other two
groups' results, media trust was not connected to being reli-
gious. Lack of trust in media fairness of reporting and being
religious independently had significant direct impacts on
ideology. Neither education nor income had an effect on
political ideology. Gender had a positive, significant effect
on media trust, meaning that women were more trusting of
media, and it was negatively linked to household incomes,
meaning that men's incomes were higher.
Security and ideology. Although most findings were relatively
consistent in the three samples, the relationships of secure
attachment style and ideology clearly were different in each
one. Results for the previous studies of college student sam-
ples were mixed, also. These results, taken together, demon-
strate that both liberals and conservatives can have secure
attachments.
Security and SES.Security was consistently positively and
significantly linked to household income in all three sam-
ples, and security positively and directly affected education
in the 2014 sample of the general public. All the previous
studies of college students and the present study concerned
primarily more advantaged social groups. Perhaps greater
SES promotes more secure attachments, regardless of politi-
cal leanings.
Ideology and SES.Household income was significantly and
positively connected to ideology only in 2013, but education
was negatively and significantly related to ideology in both the
general population samples. The finding of lower education
directly influencing conservatism is consistent with other
research that has reported lower education characterizing con-
servatives (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & Sanford,
1950; Hindman & Yan, 2015; McCutcheon, 1985; Stone,
Lederer, & Christie, 1993/2011; Stubager, 2008). It is not
unusual to find that conservatives, especially if better educated,
have higher household incomes than well-educated liberals,
even though conservatives tend to be less well educated overall
(Diercks & Landreville, 2017; Gaziano, 2014; Hindman &
Yan, 2015). Well-educated liberals tended to be younger and in
earlier stages of the life cycle than well-educated conservatives
in Gaziano (2014). Better educated liberals were more likely
than better educated conservatives to have advanced degrees.
Future Research
At least four areas of future study come to mind. These
include analyses of adult attachment relational style in lower
SES groups, attachment style and types of information envi-
ronments, the relationship of attachment style and further
elaboration of the models of nurturant parent and strict par-
ent families, and examination of attachment styles in groups
with extreme political attitudes. As most of the research so
far has been done in the United States, research should be
carried out in other countries, as well. Although the models
did well enough in this study, they could be refined further
and new concepts tested.
First, the results suggest that future research should
emphasize the relationship of ideology to attachment in pop-
ulation segments with lower education and incomes. While
the current project found security to be more relevant to ide-
ological orientation than avoidance or anxiety, future
researchers should concentrate more on forms of insecure
attachment in lower SES groups with regard to a range of
social and economic issues. The 2016 U.S. election points up
the need to better understand the needs and concerns of
White working class population segments, as well as other
lower and working class ethnic and racial segments. For
White working class groups, declining economic and job
opportunities was a primary element in their vote decisions
(Wan, 2017). Related elements were rising rates of mortality
and morbidity among these groups (Achenbach & Keating,
2017; Case & Deaton, 2017). They also were more likely
than higher SES groups to feel like strangers in their own
country (Cox, Lienesch, & Jones, 2017). In general, voters of
various SES groups who supported Donald J. Trump for
president tended to support racist attitudes (Wood, 2017), to
accept false information and untruths that support one's
views (Sykes, 2017), and to defend vulgarity, crude behav-
ior, and bullying (Martin, 2017). The social conditions that
foster such beliefs and attitudes could be delved into with an
eye to addressing solutions to these issues.
Factors that promote less secure attachment styles among
lower SES groups may help to explain attitudes and beliefs in
these groups. Complicating factors in the links between lower
Gaziano 13
SES and insecure attachment is that lower SES families are
vulnerable to multiple stresses of poverty, such as poorer
health, lack of stable employment, teen parent and/or single-
parent status, and living in more crowded conditions, which
can drain parents physically and emotionally and consequently
constrain their ability to parent as well as they would wish
(Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, & Bradley, 2005;
Bavolek, 2001; Conger, Patterson, & Ge, 1995; Hackman,
Farah, & Meaney, 2010; Lynch, Kaplan, & Shema, 1997).
Second, security of attachment style and types of infor-
mation channels may yield insights into the consequences of
fragmented media environments and insular discussion net-
works as political polarization increases. These processes
may have implications for knowledge and belief gaps, flows
of inaccurate information, and tolerance of differing view-
points (Duca & Saving, 2017; Garrett, Weeks, & Neo, 2016).
Numbers and types of information networks can be explored.
Researchers have revealed sociological fault lines in the dis-
semination of information in mainstream and partisan news
sources and ideological blogs (Eveland & Dylko, 2007;
Hindman & Yan, 2015; Jamieson & Cappella, 2009).
Fragmentation can lead to decreased understanding of con-
flicting views and diminished tolerance for diversity, particu-
larly among more partisan groups who may be among the
easiest to mobilize to support political candidates for office
(Baum & Groeling, 2008; Dilliplane, 2011; Iyengar & Hahn,
2009; Shapiro & Bloch-Elkon, 2008; Tewksbury, 2005).
Third, attachment styles could be studied further within
the framework of nurturant parent and strict parent families,
and further insights could be gained by refining the concep-
tualization of liberals as coming from nurturant parent fami-
lies versus conservatives as coming from strict parent
families (Barker & Tinnick, 2006; Feldman & Stenner, 1997;
Lakoff, 2002). These conceptualizations currently may be
too simplistic. One avenue for future research in adults is
retrospective recall of perceived parenting styles or longitu-
dinal studies from childhood or adolescence through adult-
hood. One approach could be contrasting parental
demandingness, or control, with parental responsiveness, or
warmth (see, for example, Baumrind, 1971, 1996; Maccoby
& Martin, 1983; Murray & Mulvaney, 2012). Other insights
could be gained from comparing family communication pat-
terns and attachment (Gaziano, 2001).
Fourth, attachment and extreme ideologies should be
studied more. An interesting example is that of Roccato
and Ricolfi (2005), who examined six nonstudent right-
wing and left-wing political militant groups in Turin and
Palermo, Italy. While avoidantly attached participants
were far less religious than securely attached participants
in the present study, the Italian study described one group
of activists who were the most overtly antidemocratic,
right-wing, and avoidant in attachment style, yet who were
also among the most religious of the militants. This sug-
gests that additional insights into attachment and ideology
may be gained by studying politically active groups of dif-
ferent types.
