The study examined whether a test of walking speed provides similar predictive information on mortality risk as
does a summary measure of lower body function. Data were from the Hispanic Established Population for the
Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly database and included Mexican Americans aged 65 years or more (1993­
2000). Primary measures included a short physical performance battery, a test of walking speed, and mortality. The
average age of the sample was 72.0 years, and 58.3 percent were women. The observed hazard ratio of mortality
risk was similar for the full short physical performance battery and walking speed alone, in both unadjusted and
adjusted baseline models. A time-dependent walking speed measure showed a more than twofold increased risk of
mortality for individuals categorized with slower walking speed. The results also showed a linear association
between continuous walking speed and mortality with and without adjustment for baseline covariates. This study
provides evidence that walking speed alone can provide similar information on mortality risk as does a more
comprehensive summary measure of physical performance. Because walking speed is a quick and easy-to-
administer test, findings have implications for clinical use, especially among underserved minority groups where
cultural and language barriers may exist.

The belief that health care for older adults should include
an assessment of functional ability is well recognized. A
change in lower body function can potentially alter the in-
dependence and quality of life of the older adult and lead to
an increased reliance on families or agencies for care (1­4).
About one third of the older US population currently reports
some lower body limitations, with women, minorities, and
those with low socioeconomic standing at higher risk (5).
Projections indicate that the cost of care for older adults
with functional limitations will almost triple over the next
40 years, from $123 billion to $346 billion (6). With rising
health-care costs and more people living longer, the benefits
of routinely screening for disability and functional lim-
itations are potentially enormous. In the clinical setting,
however, an easy-to-administer, standard method of as-
sessing physical and functional performance has not been
established.
In the community setting, objective physical performance
measures that involve performing a movement or task
according to a standardized protocol have been developed
to identify at-risk older adults in the mild to moderate range
of functional disability. In particular, a short physical per-
formance battery (SPPB) that includes a hierarchical test of
standing balance, a test of walking speed, and repetitive

chair stands has been used to categorize older individuals at
risk for falls, deconditioning, or other serious health condi-
tions that affect independence and survival (7). Community-
based studies further suggest that, of the three individual
SPPB components, the short walk may contribute the most
clinically relevant information about the older adult's cur-
rent and future health (8­12).
In the analysis presented here, we examined whether
walking speed alone could provide information on mortality
risk comparable with the full SPPB in a sample of older
Mexican-American adults. We also examined whether a lin-
ear gradient of mortality risk could be predicted by walking
speed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and subjects
The details of the study design and methods have been
reported elsewhere and are summarized here. Subjects were
Mexican-American adults aged 65 years or more from the
Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic
Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE) database (13). Subjects
were selected from the five southwestern states of Texas,
California, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The sam-
ple design was for a multistage area probability cluster sam-
ple that involved selection of counties, census tracts, and
households. In the first stage, counties (a small census-based
geographic area) were selected if at least 6.6 percent of the
county population was of Mexican-American ethnicity. In
the second stage, census tracts were selected with a proba-
bility proportional to the size of their older (aged 65 years)
Mexican-American population, using counts from the 1990
US Census. In the third stage, census blocks (small area
units within census tracts) were selected at random to obtain
at least 400 households within each census tract. These
households were screened to identify persons who were
older Mexican Americans. The sampling procedure ensures
a sample that is generalizable to the more than 500,000 older
Mexican Americans living in the Southwest. The five states
in the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemi-
ologic Study of the Elderly sampling frame contain 85
percent of the 65-and-older Mexican-American population
living in the United States. In-home interviews were
conducted in Spanish or English on 3,050 older Mexican
Americans.
The eligibility criteria for the current study, in addition to
nonproxy interview (n ¼ 316), included older Mexican
Americans with no history of the following medical condi-
tions: heart attack, stroke, diabetes, or hip fracture. As well,
older Mexican Americans had to report no limitations in
basic activities of daily living at the baseline interview in
1993. Twenty-eight subjects were removed because of miss-
ing anthropometric data. No significant differences were
found between the older Mexican Americans included in
the study and those who reported at least one activities of
daily living limitation or medical condition (n ¼ 1,076)
among the following sociodemographic and health indica-
tors: age, sex, marital status, education, smoking status, and
body mass index. Older Mexican Americans included in the
study were less likely to be depressed (p ¼ 0.0001) than
those excluded from the study.
Vital status information that included death data was col-
lected on 1,630 older Mexican Americans. Deaths through
December 31, 2000, were ascertained through proxy in-
formants and confirmed by a mortality search of the Social
Security Administration's Death Master File. A total of 440
study participants died over the 7-year follow-up.
Lower body performance-based tests
Lower body performance-based tests included a hierarchi-
cal test of standing balance, a short walk, and five repetitive
chair stands. For each test, a five-level summary scale from
0 to 4 was created on the basis of previously established
criteria (14).
For the hierarchical standing balance task, subjects were
asked to place their feet in a side-by-side position, followed
by a semitandem position (heel of one foot alongside the big
toe of the other foot) and a tandem position (heel of one foot
directly in front of the other foot). There were five catego-
ries: 0 (unable); 1 (able to hold side-by-side position but
unable to hold semitandem position for 10 seconds); 2 (able
to hold semitandem position for 10 seconds but unable to
hold full tandem position for more than 2 seconds); 3 (able
to hold full tandem position for 3­9 seconds); and 4 (able to
hold full tandem position for 10 seconds).
To test the ability to rise from a chair, we asked subjects to
complete five repetitive chair stands as quickly as possible
after first demonstrating the ability to rise once from the
chair with arms folded across their chests. Again, there were
five categories: 0 (unable); 1 (16.7 seconds); 2 (13.7­16.6
seconds); 3 (11.2­13.6 seconds); and 4 (11.1 seconds).
Walking speed was assessed to the nearest tenth of a second
by asking subjects to walk 8 feet (2.4384 m) at their normal
pace. There were five categories: 0 (unable); 1 (9.0 sec-
onds); 2 (6.0­8.9 seconds); 3 (4.0­5.9 seconds); and 4 (3.9
seconds).
A short physical performance battery (SPPB) score was
created for each subject (range: 0­12) by adding the scores
on each of the three tests, with higher scores indicating
better lower body function. The SPPB was categorized in
the following way: 1 (scores 0­3); 2 (scores 4­6); 3 (scores
7­9); and 4 (scores 10­12). The SPPB has shown excellent
reliability and sensitivity to change (15). Intraclass correla-
tion coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.92 for measures
made 1 week apart (15).
Covariates
Baseline sociodemographic covariates included age, gen-
der, marital status, and years of education. Indicators of
baseline health status included current smoking (yes or
no), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2), cognition,
and depressive symptoms. Cognitive function was measured
by the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination (16). Scores
on this scale have a potential range of 0­30, with lower
scores indicating poorer cognitive ability. Depressive symp-
toms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (17). The scale consists of 20 items
600 Ostir et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2007;166:599­605
in which subjects are asked whether they have experienced
certain feelings or symptoms in the past week (17). Re-
sponse items are scored on a four-point scale of 0­3 with
a range of 0­60, where higher scores indicate increased
depressive symptoms. For the analysis, individuals with
a score of 16 or more were classified as having high levels
of depressive symptoms (17).
Statistical analysis
Sociodemographic characteristics and health-related in-
dicators were compared across a two-level survival variable
(alive vs. died), with significance tests by v2 analysis. Cox
proportional hazard models using the PROC PHREG state-
ment (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) were used to
estimate the hazard ratios of death over 7 years of follow-up.
To compare the relation between SPPB and walking speed
on risk of mortality, four sets of Cox proportional hazard
models were computed. The first set of models examined
univariate associations for baseline SPPB and walking
speed on mortality risk. The second set of models added
baseline sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital
status, and years of education) and health status covariates
(current smoking status, body mass index, depression, and
cognition). A third set of models further added time-dependent
covariates including a summary medical conditions index
(heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and hip fracture), marital
status, body mass index, cognition, and depressive symp-
toms. A final set of models that included time-dependent
SPPB and walking speed variables, as well as the time-
dependent covariates described above, estimated the hazard
ratios of death. Information on time-dependent covariates
was gathered by an in-home interview approximately every
2-years after the baseline interview.
Applying the LOESS smooth method (SAS Institute,
Inc.) to Martingale residuals, we also tested for a linear
association between continuous walking speed and mortal-
ity risk with and without adjustment for baseline covariates.
Inflection points on the curves were estimated by nonlinear
least-square regression (``Marsh L''), which was then used
to fit piecewise Cox proportional hazard models to estimate
the hazard ratio of mortality risk by walking speed (range:
2­20 seconds). All analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and
all model assumptions were tested and met.
RESULTS
At the baseline interview, the mean age was 72.0 (stan-
dard deviation (SD): 6.1) years, and 58.3 percent were fe-
male. The mean number of years of education was 4.8 (SD:
3.8); 73.8 percent were married, and 59.1 percent were non-
smokers. The sample was, on average, overweight with
a body mass index of 27.8 (SD: 5.1).
Sociodemographic characteristics and health indicators
stratified by survival status are shown in table 1. Individuals
alive at the end of the 7-year follow-up were more likely to
be younger, female, a nonsmoker, and with at least a high
school education. Frail individuals (i.e., body mass index
of <22) were more likely to die over the follow-up period.
High depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Stud-
ies Depression Scale: 16) were not significantly associated
with an increased risk of death.
Figures 1 and 2 show unadjusted associations for the
categorical SPPB and walking speed measures with the
7-year survival rate, respectively. Both figures indicate a sim-
ilar gradient of association between better lower body func-
tion and increased survival. Figure 1 shows that 81 percent
of older Mexican Americans who scored in the highest
SPPB category (``SPPB - 3'') were alive at the end of 7 years
compared with 57 percent of those who scored in the lowest
SPPB category (``SPPB - 0''). Approximately 82 percent of
older Mexican Americans who completed the 8-foot walk in
less than or equal to 3.9 seconds (``Walk - 4'') survived over
the 7 years of follow-up compared with 57 percent of those
who were unable to perform the walk (``Walk - 0'') and
67 percent who were in the slowest walking speed category
(``Walk - 1'').

To evaluate the independent association between lower
body function and risk of mortality, we developed four sets
of survival models for the SPPB and walking speed mea-
sures (table 2). The first set of models (I) tested univariate
associations for SPPB and walking speed, respectively, on
risk of death. These models showed an increased hazard
ratio of death for older Mexican Americans categorized with
lower functional ability. The increased hazard ratio of death
for those who scored in the lowest SPPB category of 0­3
was 2.43 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.56, 3.76)
compared with the reference category of 10­12, and for
those who scored in the two lowest walking speed categories
of 0 and 1, the associated increased hazard ratio of death
was 2.90 (95 percent CI: 1.79, 4.70) and 1.80 (95 percent CI:
1.24, 2.62), respectively, compared with the reference cate-
gory of 4.

models (II). The results showed a significant association
between the low SPPB category of 0­3 and increased hazard
ratio of death of 1.64 (95 percent CI: 1.02, 2.63). Nonsig-
nificant associations were observed between the other two
SPPB categories with scores of 4­6 and 7­9 and risk of
death. The walking speed model also showed significant
associations for those in the two slowest walking speed
categories of 0 and 1 and increased hazard ratio of death.
In the third set of analyses, time-dependent covariates
were added to both models (III). The results showed an
increased hazard ratio of death for those in the lowest three
SPPB categories, while increased hazard ratios for death
were found for those in the two lower walking speed cate-
gories. A final set of models (IV) examined associations for
time-dependent SPPB and walking speed variables on risk
of death, with adjustment for the time-dependent covariates
included in the third set of models. The results showed a
strong and significant association between the time-dependent
walking speed measure and increased risk of death. A signif-
icant association was also found between the time-dependent
SPPB measure and death.
Figure 3 shows the relation between continuous walking
speed and death risk with and without adjustment for base-
line covariates including sociodemographic characteristics
(age, sex, marital status, and years of education) and health
status covariates (current smoking status, body mass index,
depression, and cognition). Both the unadjusted and ad-
justed models showed a linear gradient of increased risk
of death with walking speeds between 2 and 15 seconds
and a plateau effect thereafter. In the unadjusted and ad-
justed models, each second of increase in walking speed
was associated with about a 9 percent and 6 percent increased
risk of death, respectively. On average, an individual's time to
complete the walking speed task increased by 2.2 seconds
(SD: 6.3) over the follow-up period. Over this same period of
time, the average decline in SPPB score was 1.1 points (SD:
3.6). In unadjusted and adjusted models, each point decline in
SPPB score corresponded with about a 6 percent and a 4
percent increased risk of mortality, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The current study provides evidence that walking speed
can provide a simple and objective way to assess declines in
mobility over time in a minority population. The study also
showed an association between mobility decline and in-
creased mortality risk. To increase the clinical applicability
of our findings, we used walking speed as both a categorical
and a continuous measure, and results were compared with
an established summary measure of lower-body function
(SPPB). Also, all deaths included in the analysis were con-
firmed by a search of the Social Security Administration's
Death Master File.
Our main finding can be summarized as follows. The
association between a baseline measure of walking speed
and risk of death was similar to the full SPPB with and
without the addition of baseline and time-dependent covar-
iates. This result was not unexpected and complements
other research on performance-based measures of lower
body function. For example, in an ethnically diverse sample
of adults aged 65 years or more and living in the community,
walking speed alone performed almost as well as the full
SPPB in predicting incident disability (18). More recent
data from a Veterans Affairs and a Medicare health man-
agement organization database showed walking speed and
SPPB to similarly predict risk of hospitalization (11). Other
studies have also shown a link between mobility and health
outcomes including fall risk, mobility disability, hospitali-
zation, and the need for caregiver support (10, 12, 19).
Our use of time-dependent SPPB and walking speed
measures over 7 years of follow-up also highlights the dy-
namic nature of lower body function. The especially strong
and significant association between the time-dependent mo-
bility variable and mortality suggests the importance of on-
going and regularly scheduled evaluation to identify older
adults who show decrements in walking speed. Early iden-
tification of change in walking speed may alert clinicians to
recommend medical or rehabilitative interventions that
could slow or reverse this trend and affect change in the
underlying cause of the decline.
Taken together, the current study and previous research
on mobility (10­12) indicate the robustness of the walking
speed measure and support its use as a valid predictor of
health risk in older adults. Moreover, because walking plays
a vital role in daily life and is little influenced by language or
cultural differences, a number of researchers have suggested
that a standardized walking speed measure be incorporated
into the clinical setting as an instrument of health assess-
ment (10, 11, 20). Our finding of a linear gradient of asso-
ciation with mortality risk, ranging from 2 to 15 seconds,
supports the use of walking speed in the clinical setting. The
current study, however, does not address the question of
a standardized length of test. As a measure of clinical

outcome, a test of walking speed needs to be responsive to
clinical change without placing an undo burden on the pa-
tient to perform the task. Therefore, understanding the po-
tential advantages and disadvantages of a 2.44-m (8-foot)
walk versus a 4-m (13.1-foot) or 6-m (19.7-foot) walk, for
example, would be useful.
Other researchers have also suggested that walking speed
be used as a screening tool to identify and recruit older
adults with specific levels of functioning into clinical trials
(21). However, if walking speed is to be routinely collected
and used in a clinical setting or in clinical trials, it then
becomes important to understand pathways that mediate
change in walking speed. From a biologic perspective, ev-
idence suggests that inflammatory pathways such as inter-
leukin 6 and D-dimer, independent of sociodemographic
characteristics and health behaviors, are linked to mobility
function (22­24). Change in these two inflammatory
markers may be an early indication of impending functional
decline, even in otherwise healthy older adults.
From an environmental perspective, pathways that medi-
ate change in mobility are less clear but may include socio-
economic status, access to social services, social isolation,
and sedentary behavior (25­27). Research also suggests the
importance of neighborhoods in relation to mobility-related
activities (28). Neighborhoods with high levels of employ-
ment and green spaces for leisure have been linked to in-
creased walking activity. On the other hand, high poverty
neighborhoods, which increase exposure to crime, vandal-
ism, noise pollution, and overcrowding, have been linked to
poorer health and decreased walking activity (29, 30). Data
from the 2000 Census (31) indicate that about 20 percent of
older Mexican Americans live at or below the poverty level,
which suggests that the association between mobility and
mortality risk for this group may be, in part, mediated by
neighborhood disadvantage.
The current study has some limitations. First, the sample
included physically healthy older Mexican Americans who
reported no difficulty in performing basic activities of daily
living and who were free of comorbidities at baseline inter-
view. By initially excluding individuals further along the
disabling pathway, we reduced the possibility of over-
estimating the association between lower body function
and mortality. However, because walking is critical to the
independence and well-being of the older adult, it would
be important and interesting to replicate these findings in
a more disabled and chronically ill sample of older adults,
such as those hospitalized. A number of studies suggest that
deconditioning occurs rapidly in the older patient, and a fo-
cus on understanding the factors that slow the progression of
mobility decline in hospitals could provide useful informa-
tion on recovery patterns. A second limitation of the study is
that the current findings may not generalize to other popula-
tions and may be an area of future research. However, a study
by Guralnik et al. (18) showed the SPPB to similarly predict
disability across three older ethnic populations including
non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics.
Our study also has several strengths including its large
community-based sample, its prospective design, and use of
an objective measure of lower body function (walking speed)
in the largest minority population in the United States (31).
In summary, our findings indicate that walking speed is
associated with mortality and that this simple measure may
play an important role in the clinical setting as a complement
to more traditional assessments of health status in older
adults. Previous research has demonstrated that functional
declines can be slowed or reversed with early detection (32­
34). Walking speed, therefore, has the potential to identify
persons at risk for frailty and disability who may be targeted
for appropriate prevention and intervention programs.
