Introduction
Military personnel needs to be able to function well after and
under highly stressful and complex conditions. It is typically
assumed that, through selection, training or experience, mili-
tary personnel is more resilient to stress than civilians and
that their judgment is less affected by stress. However, until
now, this hypothesis has not been tested.
An important type of judgment that army personnel needs
to make is the threat posed by the individuals they encounter
(Becker et al., 2011). It is known that people typically base
their initial rapid assessment of the intentions of "the other" on
facial trustworthiness judgments (Klapper, Dotsch, van Rooij,
& Wigboldus, 2016). The neural mechanisms that are involved
in these judgments also mediate stress reactions (van Marle,
Hermans, Qin, & Fernández, 2009). Because acute stress typi-
cally induces negative affect, it is likely to negatively modu-
late (bias) facial trustworthiness judgments. Especially in
stressful peace keeping operations involving regular social
contact with civilians (i.e., people who do not directly take
part in the conflict), military should at all times maintain their
ability to make unbiased social judgments. If stress should
compromise this capability (with potentially serious and even
deadly consequences), this would indicate the need for stress
awareness training or inoculation programs.
In this study, we investigate acute stress in civilians and
army personnel, using both subjective and objective (physi-
ological) stress response measures. For both groups, we
examine the effect of the stressor on facial trustworthiness
judgments and the association between stress and facial
judgment. We hypothesize that (Hypothesis 1 [H1]) army
personnel is more resilient against acute stress than civilians,
that (Hypothesis 2 [H2]) acute stress negatively biases facial
trustworthiness judgments, and that (Hypothesis 3 [H3]) this
effect is weaker in army personnel than in civilians.
In the next sections, we discuss factors that modulate sus-
ceptibility to stress and that are potentially relevant for our

Stress Response and Facial
Trustworthiness Judgments in Civilians
and Military

Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that, either through training or selection, military personnel is more resilient to stress than
civilians, as indicated by several subjective and physiological measures. In addition, we examined the effect of stress on the
perceived trustworthiness of faces in these two groups. Stress was induced in 45 civilian participants and 45 army participants
through the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST). In this paradigm seven neutral sentences are presented, each followed by a
60-s interval. An eighth sentence asks participants to sing a song aloud after the next (eighth or stress) interval. Participants
rated the trustworthiness of five neutral faces, both before and after the SSST. Pupil size, heart rate, and skin conductance
were adopted as physiological stress correlates. Stress response was calculated as the difference between the mean values
over the last neutral interval and the stress interval. Subjective stress ratings were obtained before and after the SSST. The
baseline levels of all physiological and subjective measures were the same in the army and civilian groups, while all measures
showed a significant increase following the stressor. However, compared with the civilian group, army participants reported
significantly less stress and showed significantly attenuated heart rate and skin conductance responses to the SSST. These
results indicate higher stress resilience in the army compared with the civilian group. In addition, we found that perceived
facial trustworthiness decreased after presentation of the stressor, suggesting that the effect of a stressor can influence in
principle unrelated social judgments based on facial information.

topic of research, like personality and experience, and the
effects of stress on facial trustworthiness measurements.
Stress and Personality
The ability to react promptly to adverse conditions or events
that threaten homeostasis is essential for survival (McEwen,
2007; Selye, 1955). Stimuli (environmental, social, or cogni-
tive) that are appraised as threatening and unmanageable
(stressors) typically elicit a psychological state commonly
referred to as stress and trigger a cascade of behavioral and
physiological activation systems that strive to maintain
homeostasis (de Kloet, Joels, & Holsboer, 2005; Lazarus,
1999; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Mobbs, Hagan, Dalgleish,
Silston, & Prévost, 2015).
Closely associated with stress response and recovery is
the concept of resilience, a broad term defining the process
of coping with or overcoming exposure to adversity or stress.
Typical coping styles that people use to deal with the adverse
effects of stress are either active (problem- or emotion-
focused) or passive (avoidant; Afshar et al., 2015). Both the
vulnerability to stress and the preference for a certain coping
strategy depend on a person's personality traits (Afshar et al.,
2015; Schneider, Rench, Lyons, & Riffle, 2012; Vollrath &
Torgersen, 2000). People with adaptive personality traits
(e.g., high extraversion and conscientiousness) are less sus-
ceptible to stress and prefer active coping styles while people
with maladaptive personality traits (neuroticism) are more
vulnerable to stress and prefer avoidance coping. Depending
on their coping style, people perceive a stressor either as a
challenge or a threat (Blascovich, Mendes, Vanman, &
Dickerson, 2011; Delahaij & Van Dam, 2017; Seery, 2013).
Challenge is considered an adaptive response which occurs
when evaluated personal resources meet or exceed perceived
situational demands, whereas threat is seen as a maladaptive
response that occurs when the perceived demands exceed the
personal resources. Simply framing a task as either a chal-
lenge or a threat (without altering the perceive task demands)
can significantly affect a person's stress reactivity (Turner,
Jones, Sheffield, Barker, & Coffee, 2014). Challenges are
typically associated with positive affect while threats are
typically associated with negative affect (Turner, Jones,
Sheffield, & Cross, 2012).
In the current study, we investigate whether military per-
sonnel, who are typically expected and trained to be adaptive
and to view their task as a challenge rather than a threat,
show lower subjective and physiological stress responses
than civilians to a negative stressor that is well-controlled,
easy to administer, and social in nature.
Stress and Experience
Susceptibility to stress depends not only on personality but
also on previous experiences. Subjective levels of anxiety
and stress are found to be lower in experienced people than
in novices for stressful tasks like shooting under pressure
(Landman, Nieuwenhuys, & Oudejans, 2016) or skydiving
(Breivik, Roth, & Erik Jørgensen, 1998; Hare, Wetherell, &
Smith, 2013; Meyer et al., 2015; Roth, Breivik, Jørgensen, &
Hofmann, 1996). Physiological markers have been found to
indicate lower levels of stress in experienced people than in
novices as well. Pre-jump levels of heart rate (HR) were
lower for experienced skydivers than for inexperienced ones
(Breivik et al., 1998; Roth et al., 1996), as were levels of
respiration (Roth et al., 1996) and cortisol (Meyer et al.,
2015). In these skydiving studies, effects of a stressor on sub-
jective and physiological measures of stress were compared
between participants who were either experienced or not on
that specific stressor.
In the current study, we investigate the hypothesis that
military personnel, being more experienced in dealing with
stressful situations in general, show lower subjective and
physiological stress responses than civilians to a negative
stressor.
Stress and Facial Trustworthiness Judgments
Trust judgments are of primary relevance to human social
perception (Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007). This probably
reflects the result of evolutionary pressures: On encountering
strangers, people must quickly determine whether the inten-
tions of the "other" are good or bad. Perceptions of trustwor-
thiness are largely based on facial features (Oosterhof &
Todorov, 2008). People routinely evaluate facial expressions
to infer each other's specific behavioral or interaction inten-
tions. Especially under time pressure and in complex situa-
tions, these judgments are often made spontaneously
(Klapper et al., 2016; Todorov & Uleman, 2002, 2003), rap-
idly (Marzi, Righi, Ottonello, Cincotta, & Viggiano, 2012),
and largely nonconscious (Ballew & Todorov, 2007; Olivola
& Todorov, 2010; Todorov, 2011; Todorov, Mandisodza,
Goren, & Hall, 2005; Todorov, Pakrashi, & Oosterhof, 2009;
Todorov & Uleman, 2003; Tracy & Robins, 2008; Willis &
Todorov, 2006), well before relevant information has been
retrieved from memory (Rudoy & Paller, 2009). Rapid per-
sonality judgments based only on facial appearance influ-
ence various social outcomes, ranging from the willingness
to cooperate (van't Wout & Sanfey, 2008) to political voting
behavior and criminal sentencing decisions (Ballew &
Todorov, 2007; Blair, Judd, & Chapleau, 2004; Hassin &
Trope, 2000; Little, Burriss, Jones, & Roberts, 2007; Marzi
et al., 2012; Montepare & Zebrowitz, 1998; Porter, ten
Brinke, & Gustaw, 2010; Todorov et al., 2005).
Our social judgments are known to be affected by our
own (preexisting) affective state (e.g., Forgas, 1994, 1995).
In other words, people have a tendency to base their judg-
ments on their current mental state. As a result, affect elicited
by one event may infuse (bias) social judgments of unrelated
targets (the "Affect Infusion Model": Forgas, 1994, 1995).
Affect infusion is most likely to occur in situations with high
Toet et al. 3
uncertainty and time pressure when people resort to heuristic
processing strategies (Forgas, 1994, 1995). In case of trust
judgments, affect may bias the assessment since people need
to rely on heuristic information processing when judging
unfamiliar persons. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) found that
emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, guilt, and gratitude)
typically bias trust judgments in the direction of the emo-
tion's valence. Also, neutral faces are perceived as more
negative in negative self-related contexts (Wieser et al.,
2014), while socially anxious individuals interpret neutral
faces as more threatening (Schwarz, Wieser, Gerdes,
Mühlberger, & Pauli, 2013; Yoon & Zinbarg, 2007, 2008). A
recent study found that higher state anxiety causes a bias
toward identifying anger in ambiguous facial expressions
(Attwood et al., 2017).
Neuropsychological studies have shown that our ability to
constrain the spillover of affect from one context into the
next critically depends on the functioning of our lateral pre-
frontal cortex. It appears that even mild acute uncontrollable
stress can rapidly and significantly inhibit prefrontal cogni-
tive functions (Arnsten, 2009), resulting in a biased evalua-
tion of novel neutral faces (Lapate et al., 2017).
In this study, we examine whether neutral faces are judged
as less trustworthy after the occurrence of a personally rele-
vant negative stressor (whose effectiveness is examined
using other variables). If there is indeed a stress-related bias
of facial trustworthiness ratings, it is not a priori evident that
stress resilience may reduce this bias (over and above the
reduced level of stress). This will be examined here as well.
Current Study
To summarize, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that
(either through training or selection) army personnel is more
resilient to stress than civilians (as indicated by several sub-
jective and physiological measures). In addition, we investi-
gated whether stress differentially affects perceived facial
trustworthiness in these two groups. While a military realis-
tic stressor may be considered the most suitable stimulus for
this purpose, its use is evidently not desirable from a practi-
cal and ethical point of view. We therefore used an acute
social stressor in this study (the Sing-a-Song Stress Test or
SSST: Brouwer & Hogervorst, 2014) assuming that subjec-
tive and physiological stress responses to, for example, phys-
ical and body threatening stressors generalize to other types
of stressors.
Methods and Material
Participants
The participant sample was comprised of 45 male civilian
participants and 45 male army participants. The civilian par-
ticipants, aged from 18 to 53 years (M = 22.5, SD = 5.4), were
students recruited at Utrecht University (Utrecht, The
Netherlands). The army participants, aged from 24 to 49 years
(M = 31.4, SD = 6.9), were recruited at the "Oranjekazerne"
army base (Schaarsbergen, The Netherlands). For final analy-
sis, we excluded 15 civilian and 14 army participants with
missing or unreliable data in one or more of the data streams
(pupil size [PS], electrocardiograph [ECG], no cursor move-
ment in response to the trustworthiness questions for the
entire experiment), to maintain exactly the same group of
individuals for each variable. As a result, the final analysis
included 30 civilian participants, aged from 18 to 53 years (M
= 22.1, SD = 6.3), and 31 army participants, aged from 24 to
49 years (M = 31.2, SD = 6.6).
The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by
the TNO Internal Review Board on experiments with human
participants (Ethical Application Ref: TNO-IRB-2016-15-1)
and was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of
1975, as revised in 2013 (World Medical Association, 2013)
and the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological
Association. All participants gave their written consent prior
to the experiment.
Stress Induction
The validated SSST (Brouwer & Hogervorst, 2014) was
used to induce acute stress. In the SSST paradigm, partici-
pants are instructed to sit still in front of a computer screen
and read some neutral sentences that are consecutively pre-
sented, each followed by a 60-s countdown interval (the neu-
tral intervals). The final sentence announces that the
participant should sing a song aloud after the next countdown
interval (the stress interval). It has been shown that the antic-
ipation of singing reliably induces an acute stress response at
levels that are comparable to that induced by the more elabo-
rate Trier Social Stress Task, where the SSST paradigm con-
trols for motor activity and perceptual input (Brouwer &
Hogervorst, 2014). In this study, we used seven neutral
Dutch phrases that were presented for 5 s each and followed
by a timer counting down from 60 to 0 s. The eighth sentence
was (translated from Dutch): "Task: Start singing a song
aloud when the counter reaches zero. Keep sitting still until
that moment." This eighth stress sentence was similar in
length and structure to the previous seven neutral sentences.
An example of a (translated) neutral sentence is "Sentence:
The first vacuum cleaner was constructed by Sweep
Company. This was in 1907 and the device was called
Hoover." A confederate (posing as an additional participant
waiting for his turn) was present during the entire experi-
ment. The confederate and the experimenter together formed
the audience that served to increase the social stress experi-
enced by the participant (Harris, 2001). The version of the
SSST used in this study was shortened and simplified com-
pared with the original version as described by Brouwer and
Hogervorst (2014) in that we used seven rather than nine
neutral sentences, and that we used one confederate and the
experimenter rather than two "participant" confederates.

Subjective Measurements
Perceived stress.The participants reported their perceived
stress level by positioning a mouse controlled slider along a
Visual Analog Scale (VAS; Aitken, 1969; Bond & Lader,
1974) labeled from 0 or "no stress at all" to a 100 or "a lot of
stress." This VAS was administered before the SSST (asking
for their currently experienced stress level) and after the
SSST (asking for their stress level in the countdown interval
just before singing).
Facial trustworthiness.To measure facial trustworthiness, we
selected 10 male faces from the validated Princeton Faces
Database that are classified as neutral on the Trustworthiness
dimension (Figure 1: the images with identifiers fi_000_tw3.
bmp - fi_009_tw3.bmp, available from http://tlab.princeton.
edu/databases/25-maximally-distinct-identities-trustworthi-
ness; see also Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008; Todorov, Dotsch,
Porter, Oosterhof, & Falvello, 2013). We selected faces that
were neutral on Trustworthiness as their affective appraisal is
most likely to be influenced by the emotional state of the
observer because of their ambiguous nature (Cooney, Atlas,
Joormann, Eugène, & Gotlib, 2006; Yoon & Zinbarg, 2008)
while they minimize the risk of facial trustworthiness adapta-
tion (Wincenciak, Dzhelyova, Perrett, & Barraclough, 2013).
We only used Caucasian male faces to eliminate sex- and race
contingent face aftereffects (Anthony C (Little, DeBruine, &
Jones, 2005; Webster, Kaping, Mizokami, & Duhamel, 2004).
Five randomly selected faces from the total set of 10 were
shown during the prestress induction interval of the SSST.
The remaining five faces were presented during the poststress
induction interval. Their order of presentation was random-
ized across the participants. Hence, each face was shown only
once to each of the participants. Participants were asked to
rate the Trustworthiness of each face "on their gut feeling" by
moving a cursor along a VAS on the computer screen that was
labeled from 0 or "absolutely not trustworthy" to a 100 or
"absolutely trustworthy." No time limit was imposed for the
rating task.
Physiological Measurements
HR, skin conductance level (SCL), and PS were registered to
monitor the participant's physical response during the exper-
iment. HR (Brouwer, Van Wouwe, Muehl, van Erp, & Toet,
2013; Mandrick, Peysakhovich, Rémy, Lepron, & Causse,
2016; Mandryk, Inkpen, & Calvert, 2006), SCL (Brouwer
et al., 2013; Lang, 1995), and PS (Mandrick et al., 2016;
Pedrotti et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2014) are all known to reflect
stress or arousal response and expected to increase following
the stressor in this case. For each of these three physiological
parameters, we define the stress response as the difference
between their mean values over, respectively, the SSST stress
interval (the eighth and last 60-s countdown interval follow-
ing the sing-a-song assignment) and the last neutral SSST
countdown interval (the seventh 60-s countdown interval
following the last neutral sentence).
HR and skin conductance. The SCL and HR signals were digi-
tized with a BioSemi ActiveTwo AD-box (www.biosemi.
com) and stored on a Dell Optiplex 960 computer running
LabVIEW graphical software (www.ni.com) for data inspec-
tion and acquisition.
HR was determined from an ECG signal. The ECG chan-
nel electrode was placed at the sixth left intercostal space
(midclavicular line). The reference electrode was placed at
the first right intercostal space below the right clavicular
bone (midclavicular line). From the ECG data, the mean time
period between two consecutive heart beats was determined
(the interbeat interval or IBI in ms) over the two countdown
intervals of interest. The mean IBI value was then converted
to beats per minute or HR.

Skin conductance was recorded with two Nihon Kohden
electrodes which induced an oscillator signal synchronized
with the sample rate. The electrodes were applied to the tips
of, respectively, the forefinger and the middle finger of the
left hand of the participant (the hand not used to respond in
the experiment). The skin conductance signal was filtered by
a 30-Hz low-pass two-sided Butterworth filter, and mean
SCL was determined for the two countdown intervals of
interest.
PS. Left and right PS (in pixels) was sampled at 30 Hz using
an EyeTribe tracker system (theeyetribe.com; see also Ooms,
Dupont, Lapon, & Popelka, 2015) that was located directly
underneath the monitor on which the visual stimuli (faces)
were presented. Before each run, participants performed a
9-point calibration procedure. The data from the EyeTribe
were collected using the PyGaze plugin (Dalmaijer, Mathôt,
& Van der Stigchel, 2014) for OpenSesame (Mathôt, Schreij,
& Theeuwes, 2012). Samples in which pupil diameter was
recorded as 0.0 (reflecting eye blinks) were dropped from the
analysis, as were values in which pupil diameter changed by
more than 1 pixel between consecutive samples. The left­
right average pupil diameter for each system was used, and
averages were determined for the two countdown intervals of
interest.
Procedure
The experiment took place either at Utrecht University (The
Netherlands) for the civilian group or the Oranjekazerne
army base (Schaarsbergen, The Netherlands) for the military
group. After their arrival at the experimental location, the
participant and the confederate "participant" were welcomed
by the experimenter and guided to the experimental room. At
both locations, the windows in the experimental rooms were
blinded (to exclude direct sunlight), and only artificial light-
ing was used. A notebook computer was used to present the
visual stimuli (VAS scales, the SSST sentences and counters,
and the facial images), generate time stamps, and record the
eye tracking data. The same experimental setup was used at
both locations. The experimenter explained the participants
that their task was to sit still in front of a laptop screen and
read the different messages that would be presented, each
followed by a counter counting down from 60 to 0 s. They
were told that one of the messages could entail a task that
they were required to carry out after the subsequent counter
had reached 0. The participants were not informed about the
exact nature of the experiment or that it involved singing out
loud. Subsequently, the participant and the confederate both
filled out an informed consent form and the demographic
questionnaire. The experimental leader then appointed the
real participant as the one to start (since he "happened" to
have the lowest participant number on his informed consent
form), seated him in front of the laptop and attached the
physiological sensors. The confederate was asked to wait for
his turn and was seated on a chair visible from the partici-
pant's periphery. Then the electrodes for the ECG and skin
conductance signals were attached to the participant.
Participants used a chin rest such that their eyes were at a
distance of 43 cm from the center of the stimulus display.
The eyetracker was calibrated, and the experimental leader
sat down behind the participant.
Then the actual experiment started. First, the participant
reported his current stress level. Next, he rated the trustwor-
thiness of five consecutively presented male faces. The five
faces were randomly picked from the total set of 10 neutral
faces selected for this study, and presented on the screen until
the participant entered his response. Then the SSST started
by presenting seven neutral sentences in random order for 5
s each, followed by a countdown interval from 60 to 0 s. The
eighth sentence stated the request to sing a song aloud after
the following countdown interval. At the end of that interval,
the message "Please start singing" appeared. After 10 s, this
message was replaced by the message "You can stop singing
now." Immediately after the singing interval, the participant
was asked to rate the trustworthiness of five neutral male
faces (different from the ones shown before the SSST), and
the stress experienced during the final (eighth) countdown
interval of the SSST (just before singing). During the entire
experiment, both the experimental leader and confederate sat
quietly on their designated places.
In the debriefing, the researcher explained the aim of the
experiment and asked the participant whether he had sus-
pected that the other participant was a confederate. In total,
84 out of 89 participants stated that they had actually believed
that the confederate participant was a genuine participant.
Data Analysis
For all statistical analyses, a probability level of p < .05 was
considered to be statistically significant. The dependent vari-
ables of this study were as follows: the physiological mea-
surements of HR, SCL, and PS; the facial trustworthiness
measurements; and the perceived stress levels. For each of
these dependent variables, we tested whether there was a pre-
versus poststressor difference (i.e., a within-participants test
of stress response) and whether these differences were the
same for both groups of participants (between-participants
test). We also tested whether the baselines (i.e., prestressor
values) and poststressor values differed between groups.
Results
Perceived Stress
Figure 2 shows the mean subjective stress level for the civil-
ian and army participants, as experienced before the SSST
and during the SSST stress interval. Paired t tests showed
that the perceived stress levels were indeed significantly
higher during the SSST stress interval than before the SSST,
6 SAGE Open
both for civilians, t(29) = -4.35, p = .000, d = .82, and for
military, t(30)= -5.67, p = .000, d = 1.05. An independent t
test showed that the mean perceived stress level before the
SSST did not differ significantly between the army and civil-
ian groups, t(59) = -1.31, p = .19, d = .34. However, the
mean perceived stress level during the stress interval was
significantly lower in the army group than in the civilian
group, t(59) = -2.67, p = .00, d = .70. This result supports our
hypothesis (H1) that army personnel is more resilient against
acute stress than civilians. Due to the trend of a lower stress
level before the SSST in the army group, an independent t
test on the subjective stress response to the SSST (i.e., the
increase of stress) between civilian and army participants
failed to reach significance, t(59) = 1.67, p = .10, d = .43.
Thus, the significantly lower perceived stress level during
the SSST as reported by army participants compared with
civilians seems to reflect a combination of lower overall sub-
jective stress levels and a smaller stress response.
Facial Trustworthiness Judgments
Figure 3 shows the mean facial trustworthiness ratings (on a
VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100) for the civilian and army
participants, both before and after the SSST. Paired t tests
showed that mean perceived facial trustworthiness was sig-
nificantly lower after the SSST than before, both for civil-
iansm, t(29) = 2.78, p = .01, d = .53, and for military, t(30) =
2.21, p = .03, d = .41. This result supports our hypothesis
(H2) that acute social stress negatively biases facial trustwor-
thiness judgments. An independent t test showed that mean
perceived facial trustworthiness did not differ significantly
between the army and civilian groups, both before the SSST,
t(59) = -0.96, p = .33, d = .25, and after the SSST, t(59) =
-0.60, p = .55, d = .16. Also, the pre­post difference was the
same between the groups, t(59) = .15, p = .88, d = .10. Hence,
our present results do not support our hypothesis (H3) that
army personnel is less susceptible than civilians for stress-
related negative bias in facial trustworthiness judgments.
HR
Figure 4a shows the mean HR (in beats/min) over each of the
eight 60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for civilian and
army participants separately. Paired t tests showed that the
mean HR during the SSST stress (eighth) countdown interval
was significantly higher than the mean HR during the pre-
ceding last (seventh) neutral countdown interval, both for
civilians, t(29) = -7.25, p = .000, d = 1.68, and for military,
t(30) = -5.67, p = .000, d = 1.35. This indicates that the SSST
successfully induced stress in both groups. An independent t
test showed that the mean HR during the last neutral SSST
interval did not differ significantly between the army and
civilian groups, t(59) = -0.69, p = .49, d = .18. However, the
army group had a significantly lower mean HR than the
civilian group during the SSST stress interval, t(59) = -2.44,
p = .01, d = .64. To compare the HR response with the SSST
between civilian and army participants, we computed for
both groups the difference between the mean HR values over
the SSST stress interval and the last neutral SSST countdown
interval. An independent t test showed that the increase in
HR in response to the SSST was significantly lower for army
participants than for civilian participants, t(59) = 2.56, p =
0.01, d = .67, supporting our hypothesis (H1) that army per-
sonnel is more resilient against acute stress than civilians.
Skin Conductance
Figure 4b shows the mean SCL (in µS) over each of the eight
60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for both civilian and
army participants. Paired t tests showed that the mean SCL
during the SSST stress (eighth) countdown interval was

significantly higher than the mean SCL during the preceding
last (seventh) neutral countdown interval, both for civilians,
t(29) = -7.93, p = .00, d = 1.50, and for military, t(30) = -4.68,
p = .000, d = .87, consistent with stress in both groups. An
independent t test showed that the mean SCL did not differ
significantly between the army and civilian groups, both dur-
ing the last neutral SSST interval, t(59) = -0.51, p = .61, d =
.13, and during the SSST stress interval, t(59) = -1.44, p = .15,
d = .38. An independent t test showed that that the increase in
SCL in response to the SSST was significantly lower for army
participants than for civilian participants, t(59) = 14.13, p =
.00, d = 3.68. Note that the latter test is less sensitive for the
large variations between participants usually found in SCL.
This finding supports our hypothesis (H1) that army personnel
is more resilient against acute stress than civilians.
PS
Figure 4c shows the mean PS (in pixels) over each of the
eight 60-s countdown intervals of the SSST, for both civilian
and army participants. Paired t tests showed that the mean PS
during the SSST stress (eighth) countdown interval was
significantly larger than the mean PS during the preceding
last (seventh) neutral countdown interval, both for civilians,
t(29) = -8.28, p = .00, d = 1.56, and for military, t(30) = -9.01,
p = .000, d = 1.67, again indicating stress in both groups. An
independent t test showed that the mean PS did not differ sig-
nificantly between the army and civilian groups, both during
the last neutral SSST interval, t(59) = -0.02, p = .97, d = .01,
and during the SSST stress interval, t(59) = -0.82, p = .41, d
= .21. An independent t test on the increase in the mean PS in
response to the SSST also did not differ significantly between
civilian and army participants, t(59) = 1.18, p = .24, d = .31.
However, and as shown in Figure 4c, there is a trend for larger
poststress PS values and larger increases from the last neutral
countdown interval to the stress interval for civilians com-
pared with army participants. These trends reached signifi-
cance when all participants with valid PS data (37 civilian and
38 army participants) were included. Thus, although the mean
PS results of the currently examined selection do not support
our hypothesis (H1) that army personnel is more resilient
against acute stress than civilians, incorporating more partici-
pants leads to findings that agree with this hypothesis.
Relation Between Facial Trustworthiness and
Stress Response
We also investigated whether any of the stress response mea-
sures in this study (HR, SCL, PS, and subjective stress
responses) were associated with the decrease in perceived
facial trustworthiness, using Pearson's product­moment cor-
relation coefficient. The results are listed in Table 1. For civil-
ians, there was a significant negative correlation between HR
response and facial trustworthiness: A larger increase in HR
was associated with a stronger decrease in perceived facial
trustworthiness. All other correlations were not significant.
Relation Between Age and Stress Response
Our military participants were somewhat older than our
civilian participants. To test whether age predicts any of the
stress response correlates measured in this study, we

computed Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient
between age and each of the physiological (HR, SCL, and
PS) and subjective (VAS scores) stress responses. The results
(listed in Table 2) showed that none of the correlations were
significant. This suggests that the stronger stress responses
we found for the civilian than for the military group cannot
be attributed to the difference in age between both groups.
Discussion and Conclusion
Stress Response
In this study, we tested the hypothesis (H1) that (either
through training or selection) army personnel is more resil-
ient to stress than civilians. We thereto measured the subjec-
tive and physiological response of army and military
participants to acute social stress.
We used a slightly modified version of the SSST procedure
to induce acute stress. The results show that the levels of per-
ceived stress, HR, SCL, and PS were all significantly raised
during the SSST stress interval compared with their baseline
levels as measured over the last neutral SSST interval, both for
civilian and army participants. This indicates that the modified
SSST successfully induced stress in all participants.
The baseline levels of all physiological and subjective mea-
sures were statistically the same for the army and civilian
groups. However, compared with the civilian group, army par-
ticipants reported significantly less perceived stress during the
SSST, and showed significantly attenuated HR and SCL
responses to the SSST. There was no significant difference
between both groups in their PS response to the SSST when
the current selection of participants was considered, but the
trend for an attenuated stress response in PS for the army
group became significant when including more participants.
Overall, our results support our hypothesis (H1) that army per-
sonnel is more resilient to stress, both subjectively and physi-
ologically. The fact that these results were found using a social
stressor with little resemblance to a common military stressor
suggests that the observed stress resilience is quite general.
Our current finding that the physiological (HR, SCL, and
PS) response to the SSST of the military was attenuated with
respect to the response of the civilian participants agrees
with a study by of Li, Duan, and Guo (2017). They found that
HR and blood pressure of people with high- and low charac-
ter strength varied in a similar way in response to a TSST,
which is another social stressor, involving preparing and giv-
ing a speech for an unsupportive audience. Thus, it appears
that resilience or character strength dampens the response to
a stressor but does not completely suppress it.
Facial Trustworthiness
Our results show that both army and civilian participants
rated the perceived facial trustworthiness of neutral faces
significantly lower after experiencing the SSST. Thus, the
present results support our hypothesis (H2) that acute social
stress negatively biases facial trustworthiness judgments.
This agrees with the recent finding that higher state anxiety
can cause a negative bias in judging ambiguous facial expres-
sions (Attwood et al., 2017). The effect of the stressor on
mean perceived facial trustworthiness did not differ signifi-
cantly between the army and civilian groups. Hence, this
finding does not support our hypothesis (H3) that army per-
sonnel is less susceptible than civilians for stress-related
negative bias in facial trustworthiness judgments.
It appears surprising that both groups showed a similar
decrease in facial trustworthiness in response to the social
stressor, although they experienced different levels of stress as
indicated by the physiological and subjective measures. In
accordance with this, we only found a modest link between the
stress response and the decrease in facial trustworthiness
through the correlational analyses--there was only a correla-
tion between the decrease in facial trustworthiness and the
increase in HR for civilians. This may be caused by the fact
that the faces were judged only after the stress interval had
ended. This was done to not reduce the stress through a double
task and not to confound the physiological measures of stress
with body movement related to the judging. However, the
downside of this methodological decision is that at the time of
judgment, stress may have already partially passed resulting in
a less clear relation between stress and trustworthiness judg-
ments, and a weaker effect of stress on trustworthiness rating
in general. Another possible reason for the modest link
between stress response and decrease trustworthiness rating is
related to the observation that even mild acute uncontrollable
stress can rapidly and significantly inhibit prefrontal cognitive
functions (Arnsten, 2009), resulting in a biased evaluation of
neutral faces (Lapate et al., 2017). If even a mild amount of
stress suffices to compromise facial trustworthiness judg-
ments, this could explain our present finding that acute stress
reduced the perceived facial trustworthiness of neutral faces to
a similar degree for both military and civilians. Moreover, this
suggests that stressful experiences in general may negatively
bias facial trustworthiness judgments, independent of their
intensity. Follow-up research is required to investigate whether
stress affects trustworthiness in such an all or none way, or

whether our finding is related to the fact that trustworthiness
judgment and the stress peak did not exactly coincide in time.
Future Directions
Our subjective and physiological results indicate that the
army group was more resilient to stress than the civilian
group. However, this study does not answer the question
whether the observed differences are due to preexisting per-
sonality characteristics between civilians and army person-
nel or to military training and experience. Thus, future
studies will need to examine, using within-subjects designs,
individuals prior to and after military training.
Neutral faces are probably more profoundly evaluated in
self-related contexts than in contexts that have no direct per-
sonal relevance (Schwarz et al., 2013). Hence, the effects
observed here may become more evident when the faces that
are to be judged have a direct relation with the observer.
We did not measure personality factors like trait anxiety
(State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]: Spielberger, Gorsuch,
& Lushene, 1970). However, previous studies found that expe-
rience is a more powerful predictor of stress response than psy-
chological traits (Breivik et al., 1998; Roth et al., 1996).
Further studies may also focus on mitigating effects of
stress on social judgments. It is known that the salience of an
emotion's source mitigates the effects of incidental emotions
on trust (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005). Hence, individuals may
curtail the influence of stress on their social judgments by
heightening their awareness of the source of their stress.
Our current finding that there appears to be a robust spill-
over of stress on facial trustworthiness judgments suggests
the need to develop a combined social training and stress
awareness program (possibly integrated with biofeedback)
for the military (and other people working in stressful condi-
tions, such as police, firefighters, and first responders) to
mitigate these undesired side effects.
Summary
Compared with civilians, army participants reported signifi-
cantly less stress and showed significantly attenuated HR,
skin conductance, and a trend of PS responses to a social
stressor. These results indicate higher stress resilience in the
army compared with the civilian group. For both groups, per-
ceived facial trustworthiness decreased after experiencing
the stressor, suggesting that a stressor can influence in prin-
ciple unrelated social judgments based on facial information.
These findings suggest that an integrated social training and
stress awareness program (possibly with biofeedback) for
people who need to maintain social contact while working in
stressful conditions might be beneficial.
