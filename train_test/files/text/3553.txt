Introduction
Adolescents in Taiwan are increasingly experimenting with
tobacco. By 2010, the number of high school students in the
country had tried more than one cigarette by the age of 18
was 66.4% of Taiwanese teenagers (Department of Health,
2013). Initial experimentation with tobacco by adolescents
can have a long-term impact on their lives and on society
(Lam et al., 2005; Naing et al., 2004). Moreover, regular
smoking is sometimes related to more serious drug and alco-
hol use (Pelzer, 2011; Wang, 2008) and other youth-specific
social problems. This article is part of a larger study con-
ducted by the lead author that initially investigated the moti-
vation behind why south-western Taiwanese adolescent
males chose to smoke tobacco. It was identified that there
was no study that explored if adolescent Taiwanese boys
would be affected in controlling their smoking behavior if
they were involved in an education program. In addition, the
smoking prevalence of male adolescents is 2 times that of
female adolescents (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2012).
The goal of this article, therefore, is to explore on the experi-
ences of controlling tobacco use among adolescent boys in
south-western Taiwan who have been involved in an educa-
tion program regarding smoking.
Societal Background
Adolescence is a critical stage for physical and psychological
development. It is a time when adolescents seek freedom,
autonomy, and excitement (Johnson, Kalaw, Lovato, Baillie,
& Chambers, 2004; Pelzer, 2011) and demonstrate a dislike
of rules. Smoking is one of the behaviors that teenagers use
to express their freedom. Most adolescents in Taiwan begin
smoking between the ages of 11 and 14 and become regular
smokers by 18 (Wang, 2008). Other than the psychological
characteristics of adolescence, adolescent smoking was asso-
ciated with parental smoking, peer-group smoking, stress,
poor self-esteem, body image dissatisfaction, risk-taking
behavior, and poor physical health (Croghan et al., 2006;
Johnson et al., 2004; Teevale, Denny, Nosa, & Sheridan,
2013). However, recent studies have also identified a number

The Experiences of South-Western
Taiwanese Male Adolescents Controlling
Their Smoking After Exposure to an
Education Program
Rei-Mei Hong1, Mei-Yen Chen1, Su-Er Guo1, and Lisa Hee2
Abstract
Tobacco use is the most preventable cause of chronic diseases and cancers worldwide. In south-western Taiwan, tobacco
use has become one of the top risk behaviors. Smoking in young people has been associated with alcohol addiction and drug
abuse in later life; and most smokers start young. Initiation of cigarette smoking at an early age leads to more life-years of
tobacco use, makes quitting harder, and increases the risk for serious health consequences. How adolescent boys effectively
control their tobacco use is still uncertain. The article explores on the experience of 12 adolescent boys in south-western
Taiwan controlling tobacco use as a result of participating in a smoking prevention education program. In addition to the
use of interviews and focus groups as the traditional method of data gathering, the lead author also included the use of
participants' paintings as representations of the participants' lived experience of the phenomenon. The findings of the study
suggest that adolescent boys with smoking experience in Taiwan had the desire to control their smoking behavior after
obtaining information through a local education program. In addition, they chose suitable methods for controlling their
smoking based on the information that had been provided.

of variables associated with quitting smoking/intention to
quit smoking of youths, including parental smoking behav-
ior, youth's perceived confidence to quit and perceived
importance of quitting, past quit attempts, physical activity,
and knowledge of the harmful effects of tobacco use (Doku,
Raisamo, & Wiium, 2012; Savvides et al., 2014; Wong et al.,
2011).
During recent years, antismoking has become a world
trend and one strongly encouraged by the government in
Taiwan (Wang, 2008). Yet although significant efforts have
been made to reduce the prevalence of smoking in adoles-
cence (Wakefield, Dphil, Nichter, & Giovino, 2003; Wilson
et al., 2012), smoking rates at this life stage remain high
worldwide. Since 1990, various antismoking campaigns
have been implemented including the enactment of the
Tobacco Hazards Act in 2009 by the Taiwanese government
(Department of Health, 2013). However, despite these
efforts, by 2010 the percentage of boys smoking had risen to
24.6 (Department of Health, 2013). To date, few studies
related to the control of smoking behavior among adolescent
boys have been undertaken, although some quit attempts
have been reported in adolescent boys and girls (Stanton et
al., 2001; Wang, 2008). Moolchan and Schroeder (2004)
investigated African American youth (n = 140) and European
American (n = 570) daily smokers' efforts at self-quitting
(total n = 980). They found that there was no significant dif-
ference at self-quit attempts in gender or age distribution
according to ethnicity. Elsewhere, it has been suggested that
a greater focus on educating boys'programs could be benefi-
cial in adolescent's self-quit attempts (Vuckovic, Polen, &
Hollis, 2003).
Objective
The objective of this research was to understand the lived
experiences of smoking among male adolescent, in particular
around controlling tobacco use of 12 adolescent boys in
south-western Taiwan who were involved in a smoking pre-
vention education program.
Method
Qualitative methodology was used in this study. The purpose
of using qualitative inquiry is to gain an understanding
(Runswick-Cole, 2012) of adolescent male's experience of
controlling smoking through establishing the meanings,
thoughts, and ideas of phenomena rather than predict out-
comes from data. Through the qualitative methodology, the
meanings of the controlling smoking were established by in-
depth semi-structured interviews and drawings.
Participants in this study were high school students aged
between 13 to 18 years who self-identified as having smoked
on more than two occasions, were current smokers, and will-
ing to share their experiences of smoking. Ethics approval
was granted from the Human Research Ethics Committee of
the University Hospital. Once ethics approval had been
obtained and permission from the president of the high
school was received, the researcher circulated a flyer inviting
interested students to be part of the study. Acceptance of the
invitation required the students to contact the researcher by
phone to express a personal interest in being interviewed
about their experiences of smoking. Prior to the commence-
ment of the study, informed consent was obtained in writing
from the participants and their guardian(s). Twelve partici-
pants in total chose to be involved in the study. Participation
was voluntary. All participants completed the study.
As this study is based on the lived experience, an interpre-
tive research was considered appropriate for the inquiry. To
obtain multiple perspectives about how adolescent males
control their smoking behaviors, three sources of data were
collected: (a) individual participant interviews, (b) one focus
group, and (c) individual participant paintings/drawings.
Participants
As part of a larger study investigating smoking behaviors in
Taiwanese adolescent males, this study sample consisted of
12 adolescent boys with smoking experience. The larger
study was a two-group longitudinal research designed to
examine the effects of the smoking education program on
tobacco use. The inclusion criteria of this study were
Taiwanese boys who had experience of smoking, were aged
between 13 and 18 years, and who had initiated cigarette
smoking between 11 and 14 years, as this indicated the par-
ticipants were habitual smokers. All of the participants'
fathers were smokers, and 2 of the participants had parents
who both smoked. Eleven of the participants' family eco-
nomic status was below the average. Their fathers' careers
were either fishermen or laborers. The average number of
cigarettes smoked by the participants was from 5 to 10 daily.
All of them participated in the smoking education program.
The Smoking Education Program
This study was designed to elicit an in-depth understanding
of the lived experiences of adolescent male smokers in terms
of the control of smoking while participating in an education
program that focused on the potential illness consequences
of smoking. The smoking education program included three
sessions (risks of tobacco use, government laws, and media
influence) and each session was taught by local doctors and
nurse practitioners from local hospitals for 1 hr each in the
classroom of a local high school. Diversified teaching and
learning materials have been used, including slides, videos,
learning sheets, and small-group content discussions in each
session. Through this work, adolescents'awareness of tobac-
co's severe health risks was expected to be improved. In
Table 1, the flow for the program is summarized with the
topics for the education program and the questions used in
the interviews.

Data Collection
Each participant was involved in two-face-to-face audio-
recorded interviews at the research site, each of which lasted
between 30 and 45 min. The interviews were designed to
gain the participants experience by encouraging in-depth
data. As a result, open-ended questions were used. All inter-
views were audio-taped and observation field notes were
written during each interview. The first interview was to
provide the participants an opportunity to describe their
experiences of their feeling about smoking. The rationale of
the focus group which was conducted after the second edu-
cation session provided a chance for drawing their experi-
ences of controlling smoking. Such an activity allowed time
for quiet reflection on their experiences of controlling smok-
ing and for them to share their experiences with friends. The
focus of the second interview was to provide an opportunity
for participants to share their experiences of controlling
smoking. All data were de-identified and kept securely in
locked filing cabinets. All data were collected over a
9-month period in 2012 by one researcher, thus following a
consistent approach to data collection. Pseudonyms were
used in place of participants' true names to assist in confi-
dentiality of data.
Data Analysis
All interviews were transcribed verbatim and the lead
researcher listened to the audio while reading the transcripts
several times, until experiences could be described and
"essences" were identified. These were then clustered into
common themes resulting in five defined categories or
themes. These were controlling by sleeping or eating, con-
trolling by experiencing distraction with leisure activities,
thinking of family or friends, thinking about wasting money,
and thinking about physical weakness or stunted growth.
Findings
The participants indicated how smoking became their daily
habits and were unaware of the harm to their health during
the first interview. After being exposed to the smoking edu-
cation program, all participants indicated that they would
like to quit/control smoking; however, they still had tobacco
dependence. The participants described their experiences of
controlling tobacco use that were categorized into the fol-
lowing themes.
Controlling by Sleeping or Eating (n = 8)
Control over smoking was associated with sleeping and eat-
ing. Steven, who was curious about tobacco, generally con-
trolled smoking by eating: I eat fruit or snacks . . . and after
eating food, I did not want to smoke. Similarly, Peter noted,
When I desire to smoke, I eat something (snacks, fruits, or
chewing gum), and especially in front of my girlfriend.
Sometimes, I just thought of not smoking in my mind; it
worked.
For others, smoking intensified eating, this resulted in
them eating too much without controlling their weight. I felt
hungry after smoking. I gained weight and felt tired. Also, I
felt I had become physically weaker than a year ago when I
ran. Sometimes, I didn't sleep well at night. My skin became
worse, and had pimples. I was also concerned about my sex-
ual functioning. The education classes indicated that smok-
ing would impair it. I hoped that it would not have too much
influence on my physical condition.
David indicated his use of sleeping and eating to avoid
smoking. I used sleeping or eating to control smoking
although it made me fat! It was so boring in a rural county. I
didn't know what to do at my free time. There was no super-
market and department store near my home. If I would like to
control smoking, I slept or ate delicious food. John had the

same opinion: When I slept, I did not think of cigarettes.
Therefore, I felt that my physical condition became worse,
and I gained weight. I gained 10 pounds during the 2 years
after taking up smoking. My height was still the same. I con-
trolled smoking by sleeping.
Being Distracted by Leisure Activities (n = 10)
For many of the participants, the experience of controlling
smoking behavior was assisted by participating in activities
they enjoyed, which as a result provided distraction from
smoking. Michael said, When I was playing basketball, I
never thought of smoking. Playing basketball made me con-
centrate and not think of anything else. I forgot to smoke. My
desire for smoking disappeared.
Peter discovered that I did not smoke while I was playing
video games. Peter further described, although I smoked one
pack per day, I never smoked when I played games via my
computer at home . . . I enjoyed spending time online, which
made me concentrate on that and forgot smoking. At school,
I usually played games via my mobile phone. Sometimes, I
did not smoke all day if I played games when I felt bored. As
a result of such activities, the participants experienced posi-
tive feelings even where the desire to smoke persisted. John
also said, I loved playing on the computer. When I concen-
trated on playing, I never thought of smoking. Nobody could
make me move from the chair. For these adolescent males,
playing computers, video games, Wii, and mobile phone
games had become another method for controlling smoking.
Steve pointed that when I playing computer games, I forgot
to smoke. Maybe it was because playing games had lots of
fun and I did not feel bored. I really loved games.
Sky and Bill both indicated that when I concentrated on
hearing music or reading novels, I would not smoke. I really
liked to listen to music and read novels. In general, when I
listened to music and reading novels, maybe I concentrate on
the atmosphere, I forgot smoking.
Regardless of the activity they chose, if the participants
enjoyed their activity, they became so involved and dis-
tracted with the activity that their desire to smoke disap-
peared during this time.
Thinking of Family or Friends (n = 12)
For George, his smoking behavior had become part of daily
life. George said, When my family told me to smoke less, I
sometimes listened to their words. Smoking was part of my
life. I knew smoking could cause cancer and sexual dysfunc-
tion. However, I did not have feelings about that. I did not
think of quitting smoking. Yet I controlled smoking when I
thought of my family. I did not want them disappointed.
Pan also indicated, When my family complained at me, I
thought of quitting smoking. I did not want them disap-
pointed; also, I did not want to hear them criticizing me. So
I rarely smoked in front of them. It was my way of controlling
smoking. During the drawing session, Pan portrayed himself
as follows: He smoked, but at heart he wanted to quit and
control his smoking behavior. He took pen in hand and then
described his portrait: I really wanted to quit smoking; how-
ever, it was difficult. What should I do? When I saw ciga-
rettes, I wanted to try. Therefore, I controlled smoking when
I thought of my parents.
For a number of the participants, long-standing friends
were the main motivation to control smoking. A 13-year-old
boy, David, pointed out how he controlled smoking. David
said, I never smoked in front of my girlfriend. My girlfriend
did not want me smoke. I did not want her disappointed. I
thought that I would quit for her.
John faced a similar situation to David: John's girlfriend
did not like smoking. He never smoked in front of her. As
John described it, I loved my girlfriend and so I did not want
to disappoint her . . . Although smoking made me happy and
I felt cool, I would not like to let her down. Therefore, I hoped
to find a way to quit and control smoking. Steve also indi-
cated that my best friend smoked, so I started smoking. If my
best friend did not smoke, maybe I would not have the chance
to take up smoking. Peer pressure has been influential for
these male adolescents, both negatively and positively.
Negative influences were experienced from friends who also
smoked. The pressure the participants felt to continue smok-
ing was increased due to the pressure they felt from their
others peers who also smoked. Positive peer pressure, how-
ever, also assisted in the desire to give up smoking, particu-
larly when trying to impress family or girlfriends who did
not like smoking.
Thinking About Wasting Money (n = 8)
Many of the participants thought about the waste of money
in smoking. Peter explained, I would like to quit smoking
because it costs money and affects health. All the money I
spent on cigarettes came from my daily living allowance.
Therefore, sometimes, I went hungry without eating my
breakfast in order to save money to buy cigarettes. Steven
faced the same situation: I need to save my breakfast money
to buy cigarettes. One pack of cigarettes was about $100 NT.
Although I was hungry, I still bought cigarettes because of
my craving for tobacco. Smoking really wasted my money.
However, as the cigarette became more and more expensive,
I did not have money to buy it, and I will quit it. I could not
stand to be hungry.
There was difficulty in balancing their budgets between
food and cigarettes. In the end, the cost of cigarettes also
played a role in them wanting to control their smoking or
even quit.
Thinking About Physical Weakness or Stunted
Growth (n = 11)
A number of participants felt their health had become worse
since they had taken up smoking. Most thought that their
height had not increased from the point that they took up
Hong et al. 5
smoking. They thought about physical weakness or stunted
growth after smoking and felt upset. George stated, After
smoking, I was breathless when I ran. I never had this expe-
rience before I smoked. Furthermore, John, Steven, and Peter
also indicated, My height did not grow after smoking. Steven
even mentioned that I was only 163 cm in height, short in my
class. I was worried that I would not find a girlfriend. It was
so bad that I did not keep growing after smoking. Steven
portrayed himself as follows: My height did not increase
after smoking. Also, I could not sleep at night, which meant
my spirits in the morning were low and I was tired. I tried to
control smoking because of these reasons.
John also found a similar situation as Steven: I did not
sleep well after smoking. I stayed awake until midnight. I did
not like that. I hoped that I could sleep well and my height
would continue growing up to 175 cm. During the drawing
session, Steven added a further description: He portrayed
himself having nose bleeds with colorful hair without draw-
ing his body. He said, my body became weak after smoking. I
found that I didn't grow further and had less sleeping time at
night. When I ran, I breathed heavily. I would control smok-
ing when I thought about breathing heavily.
During the drawing session, Sam drew himself as a fat
man. He offered a further description: I was fat after smok-
ing. Smoking made me eat more and more. I could not con-
trol my appetite, which made me gain weight. I gained 10 kg
after smoking. I would control smoking for losing weight. I
wanted to make girlfriend. Gaining weight made me like a
stupid man.
Discussion
The findings of this study revealed five themes reflecting the
behaviors of the participants in their experiences of living
with controlling tobacco use. The participants had also
become motivated in their desire to control or quit their
smoking after only two sessions of the education program.
They recognized links between the information given in the
sessions, for example, side effects of smoking and the things
they were personally experiencing such as not eating prop-
erly, which in turn became a motivation for them to want to
quit smoking. The provision of education assisted the partici-
pants to become more motivated to change their smoking
behaviors as indicated in the data analysis.
The themes identified were congruent with other interna-
tional studies. The participants in this study indicated that
smoking could be controlled by sleeping or eating. Although
no studies indicated youth smokers controlled their smoking
by sleeping, Larson et al. (2007) found that adolescents eat-
ing breakfast, lunch, and dinner regularly had a significantly
low percentage of cigarette use. In addition, frequent con-
sumption of fast-food meals was significantly and directly
related to smoking frequency and overall young people ate
more junk food to stop smoking (Larson et al., 2007). Their
results were consistent with this study as most participants
interviewed identified that they liked to eat fast food to con-
trol smoking.
Most participants (n = 10) also stated that smoking can be
controlled by participating in leisure activities, rather than
concentrating on the need to smoke. In the Larson et al.
(2007) study, physical activity was significantly associated
with smoking behaviors, demonstrating that participation in
team sports reduced the smoking rate in adolescents. As a
result, if adolescents were encouraged to find an activity they
enjoyed, this could provide significant support during their
efforts to reduce or quit smoking. However, in this study,
some participants controlled smoking via sleeping or eating
resulting in weight gain. These adolescent boys found a neg-
ative way to control smoking. The nurse educators could
encourage them choose a suitable activity to help them con-
trol smoking and become healthy.
Family and friend awareness were factors influencing
male adolescents' smoking habits. Jamil, Khan, Atta,
Shahzada,& Younis(2012) revealed friends and brothers
rather than parents or teachers as significant influences on
adolescents' tobacco use. Nargiso et al. (2012) also found
that close friends were significantly associated with smoking
behaviors, while family environment had no significant
effect. This was congruent with the results found in this study
where participants indicated their desire to "not disappoint"
their girlfriends.
Some participants indicated that they controlled their
smoking behaviors by thinking about wasting money, which
is similar to the results in a study by Lovato et al. (2010) who
found that students smoked less cigarettes in areas where the
cost was higher than other areas. In addition, some partici-
pants believed that smoking made them become physically
weak or stunted. There are not many studies to demonstrate
this; however, Gold et al. (1996) did conclude that the growth
of lungs was in fact stunted in adolescents who smoked.
Furthermore, smoking may not actually increase appetite as
one participant (David) had indicated, because middle ado-
lescents (13-17 years) generally experience weight gain nat-
urally associated with growth and development (Stang &
Story, 2005).
Conclusion
As previously described, self-awareness and friends exert a
great influence on teenage boys. Whether such boys smoke
depend on their strength of their social bonds with their
friends; to develop effective health education programs for
young Taiwanese smokers, finding suitable strategies is
important. Strategies employed by participants to stop or
prevent a return to tobacco use included thinking of "family
or friends," "finding activities," "thinking about wasting
money," and "thinking about physical weakening or stunt-
ing." For many of the participants, the above strategies are
the most effective ways to quit or to have motivation to stop
smoking. Vuckovic et al. (2003) suggested that teen smokers
6 SAGE Open
need to be provided with valuable information such as useful
quit tips to have motivation to stop smoking, but they have
not said what useful quit tips are. Therefore, those above
strategies in this present study might be used as quit tips for
male adolescent smokers. In addition, this study demon-
strated that the provision of knowledge to participants in a
way they could personally relate to it can assist in the moti-
vation to reduce or quit smoking. This research will help
health-related workers understand how adolescent boys con-
tribute to control of smoking, how they think about smoking,
and how smoking cessation programs can be developed for
adolescent boys.
Limitations of the Study
The study is limited by the small number of participants (n =
12) involved. The focus of the study was restricted to persons
who were involved in smoking control. Further studies could
be undertaken involving physical activity, healthy diet, eco-
nomic factor, and family members concerning the impact on
their respective lives.
