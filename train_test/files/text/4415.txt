Special Issue: Biomarkers for pathophysiology
First description of enhanced
expression of glia maturation
factor-beta in experimental
toxoplasmic encephalitis
Gungor Cagdas DINCEL
Abstract
Objective: We previously showed that Toxoplasma gondii infection induces severe neuropathology
in the form of oxidative stress, high nitric oxide production, glial activation, and apoptosis. This
study examined the association between glia maturation factor-beta (GMF-b) expression, activated
astrocytes/microglia, and neuropathology in toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE).
Methods: Mouse brain GMF expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on days 10 and
30 post-T. gondii infection.
Results: Neuropathology of infected mice was associated with increased GMF expression in
reactive glial cells and neurons compared with healthy controls. Specific up-regulation of GMF-b
expression in glial cells was associated with increased gliosis in TE.
Conclusions: GMF up-regulation in glial cells causes neuronal destruction, suggesting a TE
pathological pathway involving GMF-mediated brain cell cytotoxicity. GMF-b may therefore be a
good biomarker for disease risk assessment and to estimate host neuropathy after exposure to
T. gondii, as well as providing a new therapeutic target. This is the first study to demonstrate the
expression of GMF-b in reactive glial cells and its association with neuropathology in TE.

Introduction
T. gondii is a parasite exhibiting compul-
sory intracellular habitation and the ability
to infect warm-blooded animals including
humans.1,2 Chronic T. gondii infection
proceeds subclinically in immunocompe-
tent individuals, but it can cause severe
or even fatal toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE)
in immunocompromised patients based on
the reactivation of tissue cysts.3­5 Although

in TE has been studied for many years, it
has not yet been fully elucidated.
Glia maturation factor (GMF) was first
identified in the bovine brain and later
purified and sequenced.6­8 It is mainly
located in microglia and some neurons of
the central nervous system (CNS), although
it is also expressed in astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes.9,10
The excessive release of GMF induces
proinflammatory reactions, so GMF acts as
an inflammatory mediator causing neuronal
death in the development of neurodegenera-
tive and demyelinating diseases.9,11,12 13,14 It
also plays a key role in the regulation,
progression, and disease pathogenesis of
CNS immune responses through the produc-
tion of proinflammatory cytokines and che-
mokines.11­13 GMF-deficient mice were
previously observed to stop the disease pro-
gression of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.15,16
Moreover, the up-regulation of GMF expres-
sion is thought to contribute to the neuro-
pathology of Alzheimer's disease.9,17 Similar
studies show that GMF play a critical role on
the immune regulation, progression and
disease pathogenesis of CNS inflammations.
The aim of this study was to investigate the
relationship between GMF-b expression and
TE-related neuropathology in a mouse model
of chronic toxoplasmosis on the 10th (transi-
tion from the acute period to the chronic
period) and 30th day post-T. gondii infection.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
This study was performed in strict accord-
ance with the recommendations of the
National Centre for the Replacement,
Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in
Research (NC3Rs). The protocol was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics
of Animal Experiments of Kirikkale
University (Permit Number: 14/15-14/-
01.09.01.2014).
Animal infection model and
experimental procedures
Animals (female Swiss albino mice; age 12­16
weeks; weight 22­25 g) were obtained from
Saki Yenilli Experimental Animal Production
Laboratory (Ankara, Turkey) and were con-
tinually monitored for survival, clinical con-
dition, and weight until the time of tissue
collection. The low-virulence ME-49 strain of
T. gondii was used for infection as previously
described by Atmaca et al.18 (2014). Tissue
cysts of T. gondii were harvested from the
brains of mice that had been intraperitoneally
inoculated with 20 tissue cysts. We used 6 mice
control groups, 6 mice 10 days after infection,
and 6 mice 30 days after infections, total 18
animals in this study. Control group: 6 mice.
10 post-T. gondii infection: 6 mice 30 post-T.
gondii infection: 6 mice. Typical symptoms of
acute toxoplasmosis, including lethargy,
ruffled fur, or hunched posture, were not
observed after infection with tissue cysts.
Animals are anesthetized before infection.
That is, when work begins. Then 10 and 30
days later they were sacrificed. Animals were
anesthetized with 20mg/kg of ketamine and
5 mg/kg of xylazine. Mice were then perfused
transcardially with saline solution followed by
formalin solution using a peristaltic pump.
Animals. six animals in each groups. Control
group: 6 mice 10 post-T. gondii infection: 6
mice 30 post-T. gondii infection: 6 mice. Six
healthy mice, sacrificed at the beginning of the
study, were used as controls for immunohis-
tochemical analysis. No animals died before
euthanasia.
Necropsy and histopathology
Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital
(10 mg/kg) and sacrificed by cervical dis-
location. The brains were quickly removed,
and the squash smear technique was used to
identify T. gondii tissue cysts. Briefly,
five small randomly selected pieces of fresh
brain tissue from the infected group were
DINCEL 1671
placed onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass
slides. Sections were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formaldehyde for 1 min, and
rehydrated through a graded series of alco-
hol for 1 min. Mayer's haematoxylin was
applied to the sections for 30 s, which were
then washed with distilled water, dehydrated
through a graded alcohol series for 1 min,
cleared in xylene for 2 min, and mounted on
glass slides. Non-stained natural image and
then dyed preparations were examined
under light microscope. I do the `squash
smear' interpretation in 2 ways. Unstained
and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained
tissues were analysed.
Sections were fixed in 10% neutral buf-
fered formaldehyde for 48h and washed
under tap water overnight. Following routine
tissue preparation procedures, tissue samples
were dehydrated through a graded series of
alcohol and xylene and embedded in paraffin
blocks. Paraffin serial sections were cut at a
thickness of 4­5 mm, mounted on glass slides,
stained with H&E, and examined under a
light microscope (Olympus BX51 microscope
equipped with a DP25 camera, Tokyo,
Japan). The inflammatory infiltrate of the
CNS was scored according to the system
proposed by Silva et al.19 (2010) by counting
the total numbers of focal or diffuse inflam-
matory foci in a sagittal section. Cuffing of
blood vessels and inflammatory cell infiltra-
tion in the meninges were also analysed. All
sections were analysed in a blind manner by
two researchers. All analyses were performed
at 40Â magnification.
Immunoperoxidase examination
GMF-b expression was examined by immu-
nohistochemistry using a commercial anti-
body (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Staining was visualized on 4 - to
5 -mm-thick paraffin sections using an indirect
streptavidin/biotin kit (HRP; Thermo
Scientific). Tissue sections were placed on
adhesive slides, deparaffinized for 5 min in
each of three xylene series, and rehydrated in
a graded alcohol series and distilled water.
Antigen retrieval was accomplished by boil-
ing sections on glass slides in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0; Thermo Scientific) for 20min.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide in abso-
lute methanol for 7 min at room temperature.
Sections were rinsed three times with phos-
phate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 5 min
between each step of the test. Sections were
incubated in blocking serum for 5 min to
prevent non-specific binding. Thereafter, they
were incubated with the primary antibody
(Thermo Scientific) for 60min in a humidified
chamber at room temperature. Sections were
treated with a biotin-labelled secondary anti-
body (Thermo Scientific) for 15min and
streptavidin-peroxidase enzyme for 15min
at room temperature. Finally, sections were
incubated in aminoethyl carbazole chromo-
gen (Thermo Scientific) for 5­10min to
induce the colour reaction. Mayer's haema-
toxylin was applied as a counterstain for 1­
2 min. Thereafter, sections were mounted
with water-based mounting medium
(Thermo Scientific). As a control for non-
specific endogenous peroxidase and biotin
activities in each test, the primary antibody
step was omitted. Immunostaining was eval-
uated using a binocular microscope and
photographed under a 20Â objective lens.
Histomorphometric analysis and statistics
The density of positive staining was measured
using a computerized image system com-
posed of a Leica CCD camera DFC420
(Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions,
Ltd., Cambridge, UK) connected to a Leica
DM4000 B microscope (Leica Microsystems
Imaging Solutions, Ltd.). Five representative
fields were selected and consecutive pictures
were captured by Leica QWin Plus v3 soft-
ware under a 20Â objective lens (Leica
Microsystems Imaging Solutions) at a setting
identical to the image system for analysing.
1672 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
We used the same setting for all slides. The
integrated optical density of all GMF-b-posi-
tive staining was measured, and the mean
GMF-b-positive area/total area was calculated
by Leica QWin Plus v3. All images were
collected under the same lighting
conditions. To avoid observer bias, a blinded
investigator quantified all sections. Data were
described in terms of mean and standard
deviation (meanÆ SD) for area %. After
calculating the proportion (% pixels) of stained
area to the whole field, the mean (in % pixels)
staining area for each slide was determined.
GMF-b immunohistochemical results were
compared between groups using a one-way
analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple
comparison test. All statistical analyses and
graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism
version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA,
USA). P< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Histopathological findings
H&E-stained brain sections from control
group animals exhibited normal
architecture, but tissue cysts were observed
in the 30-day post-infection groups (Figure
1(a)). Neurohistopathological changes
included nonsuppurative and/or necrotizing
non-purulent meningitis, neuronal degener-
ation (Figures 1(a),(b)), focal gliosis (Figure
1(b)), hyperemia, perivascular mononuclear
cell infiltration, and shrunken Purkinje cells/
neurons with a highly dense eosinophilic and
necrotic appearance. Glial proliferation was
observed throughout the brain. The differ-
ence between the findings on days 10 and 30
after infection was significant. Represents
values (10 DAI) significantly lower than the
30 days after inoculation (DAI) group and
Represents values (30 DAI) significantly
higher than 10 DAI.

GMF- expression
Fairly weak immunoreactivity for
GMF-b was observed in some glial/neuronal
cells in healthy control animals (Figures 3(a),

nificantly increased in vascular endothelial
cells (Figures 4(a),(b)), some necrotic/healthy
neurons (Figure 5(a)), and especially glial
cells (Figures 5(c),(d),(e),(f)) of T. gondii-
infected animals (P < 0.005).

GMF-b expression was markedly
increased in infiltrating mononuclear cells
(gliosis focus and perivascular space) and
infiltrating microglia/macrophages of the
meninges on days 10 and 30 post-infection
(Figure 4(a), Figure 5(b)).
GMF-b immunoreactive staining areas
were also scattered in the intercellular
matrix between the neurons (Figure 4(a),
Figure 5(b)), and as dense reactive bands at
the periphery of the neurons (Figure 4(a)).
Discussion
TE occasionally exhibits a fatal course when
tissue cysts reactivate, as observed in
immunosuppressive individuals infected
with T gondii.3­5 However, because this
TE-induced neuropathogenesis has not pre-
viously been fully investigated, its severity is
only now being identified. We previously
showed that tachyzoites and bradyzoites are
not the only agents responsible for TE
neuropathology, but that high nitric oxide
(NO) production, induced oxidative stress
(OS), destruction of the blood­brain barrier,
and internally- and externally-induced
apoptosis also play important roles.20­22 In
this study, we reported increasing expression
levels of GMF-b on days 10 and 30 in mice
infected with T. gondii compared with
healthy controls. This enhanced GMF-b
expression was observed in reactive glial
cells, particularly in glial foci, suggesting
that the TE neuropathology is mediated by
GMF-b.
GMF has a high level of oxidase activity
and causes the formation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS).23­25 Moreover, GMF-b
plays an important role in oxidation/
inflammation-induced cell death,14,23,24 as
well as the apoptosis of renal proximal
convoluted tubule epithelial cells through
increased sensitization to OS.23 GMF-null
astrocytes also demonstrate increased anti-
oxidant activity and reduced ROS produc-
tion and lipid peroxidation,24 indicating that
GMF is key to the formation of OS-

associated pathology. In previous studies,
we reported that OS and apoptosis play
important roles in TE neuropathology,20,22
while this state was associated with the
overexpression of GMF-b in the present
study. Thus, it appears that GMF-b
contributes to the OS-mediated neuropath-
ology and apoptosis observed in TE.
GMF was previously shown to induce
interleukin (IL)-33 expression, which in turn
leads to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
release and the production of NO, causing

neuronal degeneration.26 Other studies
reported a significant increase in IL-33
expression in TE and ocular toxoplas-
mosis, and the IL-33/ST2 pathway was
thought to be associated with the regulation
of ocular immunopathology triggered by
T. gondii.27,28 Pathological levels of NO
were also demonstrated to cause TE neuro-
pathology, in association with significantly
enhanced TNF-a activity levels.21,29­31
Based on our present findings, we hypothe-
size that the increased expression of GMF
exhibited in TE models is an important
inducer of IL-33 expression, and acts as a
bridge in the neuropathogenesis caused by
increased NO and TNF-a expression.
T. gondii infection has been reported to
cause schizophrenia,32,33 and the pathogen-
esis of this disease shares many similarities
with TE. Both disorders present with elevated
OS and NO production21,22,34,35, decreased
activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide
dismutase,22,36 reduced expression of the anti-
apoptotic protein Bcl-2,37,20 and early apop-
tosis20,38,39. These similarities may be more
than coincidental. Indeed, cytokine-mediated
neuronal injuries are considered to contribute
to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
causing a decrease in neuronal number and
density.40 Additionally, increases in glial cell
number and density, shown in this study to be
associated with TE, were also previously
observed in schizophrenia.41­43 In the present
study, when compared with healthy control
groups, mice at 10 and 30 days post-T. gondii
infection showed elevated GMF expression,
particularly in glial cells, triggering proin-
flammatory reactions. The most striking
finding of this study was the establishment
of a previously unidentified correlation
between T. gondii and schizophrenia.
Taking all these findings into account,
increased GMF expression appears to be
important in the pathogenesis of schizophre-
nia caused by T. gondii.
The present study also showed that GMF
is a potential CSF biomarker for TE as an
indicator of T. gondii-related neuropathy.
As such a biomarker, it could be used to
estimate host neuropathy after exposure
to T. gondii, as well as the severity of
acute/chronic TE, and to identify optimal
treatment.
In conclusion, TE studies suggest that
CNS neuropathology is a complicated pro-
cess. Our findings implicate GMF as a key
mechanism in initiating cytotoxicity through
a novel proinflammatory pathway, leading
to the pathogenesis of TE. This is the first
report to reveal that GMF expression, as a
mediator of CNS inflammation, is abnor-
mally increased in TE. We propose that
GMF could be used as a novel biomarker to
inform of the severity of TE and to predict
the disease course. This study showed that
neuropathology seen in toxoplasmic ence-
phalitis may be mediated by GMF-b in a
very large proportion. Therefore, GMF-b-
related pathology must be well-defined for
this disease. Moreover, GMF inhibitor-
based therapies could be used in TE clinical
applications to prevent CNS inflammation.
