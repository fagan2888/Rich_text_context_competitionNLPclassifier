regressors and residuals

Abstract
Under the symmetric -stable distributional assumption for the distur-
bances, Blattberg et al (1971) consider unbiased linear estimators for a re-
gression model with non-stochastic regressors. We consider both the rate of
convergence to the true value and the asymptotic distribution of the normal-
ized error of the linear unbiased estimators. By doing this, we allow the re-
gressors to be stochastic and disturbances to be heavy-tailed with either finite
or infinite variances, where the tail-thickness parameters of the regressors and
disturbances may be different.
Keywords: Asymptotic distribution, rate of convergence, stochastic regressor,
stable non-Gaussian, finite or infinite variance, heavy tails

Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Die Regressionsanalyse ist eine der am häufigsten verwendeten
statistisch/ökonometrischen Methoden. Dabei wird üblicherweise die Normal-
verteilungsannahme für die Störprozesse getroffen. Für viele empirischen Daten,
insbesondere im Finanzmarktbereich, erweist sich die Normalverteilung aber als
unzutreffend, weil ihre Verteilung typischerweise durch übermässige Ausreißer
dickere Enden besitzt als die Normalverteilung. Als Alternative bietet sich die
sogenannte -stabile Verteilung an, deren Eigenschaften durch den Stabilitäts-
parameter () bestimmt werden. Diese Verteilung ist besser geeignet das Verhalten
solcher Variablen zu beschreiben; die Normalverteilung ist als Spezialfall enthalten.
Unter der symmetrischen -stabilen Verteilungsannahme für die Störprozesse haben
Blattberg u.a. (1971) einen besten linearen unverzerrten Schätzer im Rahmen eines
einfachen Regressionsmodells entwickelt. Dieser Schätzer ist bei nicht-stochastischen
Regressoren abgeleitet worden, wodurch die Anwendung, insbesondere für die Fi-
nanzmarktanalyse eingeschränkt ist. Zum Beispiel sind sowohl die Rendite des je-
weils betrachteten Papiers (als Regressand) als auch die Marktrendite (als Regressor)
im Capital-Asset-Pricing-Modell als stochastische Grössen anzusehen. Außerdem
verzichteten Blattberg u.a. (1971) auf eine asymptotische Analyse über den Schätzer.
Wir untersuchen sowohl die Konvergenzrate zum wahren Wert als auch die
asymptotische Verteilung normalisierter Schätzfehler des besten linearen unver-
zerrten Schätzers. Bei der Analyse wird zugelassen, dass die Regressoren stochastisch
sind. Die Störprozesse können sowohl unendliche als auch endliche Varianz besitzen,
wobei die Stabilitätsparameter für die Regressoren und die Störprozesse divergieren
können. Darüber hinaus untersuchen wir auch Schätzeigenschaften für einen
endlichen Stichprobenumfang unter Verwendung der Response-Surface-Analyse.
Es zeigt sich, dass sowohl die Konvergenzrate als auch die asymptotische Verteilung
normalisierter Schätzfehler eine von  (für Regressoren und Residualprozesse) ab-
hängige Funktion ist. Eine Simulationsuntersuchung über die Verteilungen normali-
sierter Schätzfehler bei endlichen Stichproben zeigt, dass die asymptotische Vertei-
lung nur eine grobe Approximation ist.
Nontechnical Summary
Regression anaysis is one of the most widely used methods in econometrics and
statisitcs, where the disturbances of a regression is usually assumed to be
normally distributed. However, the normality assumption is not appropiate for
many economic variables, especially financial markets. Financial data are
typically fat-tailed and excessively peaked around zero. One altenative
distributional assumption is -stable distributions, whose shape is governed by the
stability parameter, . The -stable distributions are more appropriate to describe
such financial variables; the normal distribution is a special case of the -stable
distribution.
Under the symmetric -stable distributional assumption for the disturbances,
Blattberg et al (1971) consider best linear unbiased estimators for a regression
model. This estimator, however, is derived with non-stochastic regressors, which
hardly enable us to apply it for finacial markets. For example, both individual
returns and the market return in the usual capital asset pricing model are
stochastic. An asymptotic analysis of the estimator is not provided in Blattberg et
al (1971) .
We consider both the rate of convergence to the true value and the asymptotic
distribution of the normalized error of the linear unbiased estimators. In so doing,
we allow the regressors to be stochastic and disturbances to be heavy-tailed with
either finite or infinite variances, where the tail-thickness parameters of the
regressors and disturbances may be different. Furthermore, using simulation and
response-surface methods we investigate the properties of the estimator.
Both the convergence rate and the asymptotic distributions of the estimator turn
out to be a function of  of the regressors and the disturbances. A simulation
result shows that the asymptotic distributions are only a rough approximation for
finite samples.

1 Introduction
For the estimation of the coefficients of a regression model one typically applies ordi-
nary least squares (OLS), which is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation
if the disturbances are normally distributed. Furthermore, according to the Gauss-
Markov theorem, the OLS estimator has the minimum variance of all linear unbiased
estimators if the disturbances follow a distribution with finite variance. However, if
the disturbances follow a distribution with infinite variance, but with finite mean, the
OLS estimator is still unbiased but no longer a minimum variance estimator.
Relaxing the normality assumption by allowing disturbances to have a symmetric
-stable distribution with infinite variance (1 <  < 2), Blattberg et al (1971) gen-
eralize the OLS estimator to a different linear unbiased estimator that minimizes the
-stable scale of the estimator. That generalization is performed in the framework of
a regression model in which the independent variable is assumed to be non-stochastic.
We consider both the rate of convergence to the true value and the asymptotic
distribution of the normalized error of the linear unbiased estimators of coefficients in
the regression model with both stochastic regressors and disturbances being heavy-
tailed with either finite or infinite variances,1 and the tail-thickness parameters of the
regressors and disturbances may be different. Even though our distributional assump-
tions are more general than the assumptions of -stability, the limiting distributions
of the estimators will often be expressed through stable random variables.
For any random variable X there is a number   (0, 2] satisfying C = A +B.
Exponent  is called the stability parameter. A random variable with exponent  is
said to be -stable distributed. Closed-form expressions of -stable distributions exist
only for a few special cases. However, the logarithm of the characteristic function of
the -stable distribution can be written as (see Zolotarev (1986) and Samorodnitsky
et al (1994) for more details on -stable distributions)

= 0, the distribution is symmetric. The shape of the symmetric -stable distribution
(SS) is determined by the tail-thickness parameter   (0, 2]. For 0 <  < 2 the
tails of the distribution are thicker than those of the normal distribution; and the
tail-thickness increases as  decreases. When  = 2, the SS distribution coincides
with the normal distribution with variance 22, the only member of the family with
finite variance. When  = 1, the SS distribution reduces to the Cauchy distribu-
tion. If  < 2, moments of order  or higher do not exist, which means the variance
is infinite. If X is an -stable random variable, 0 <  < 2, with scale , skewness ,
and location µ, then a common notation is X  S

X are given by

Some more basic information and notation on stable random variables we use,
unless otherwise specified, can be found in Samorodnitsky et al (1994).
One distinct example for a possible application of our results in the paper can
be found in financial market analysis. For econometric analysis of a dynamic capital
asset pricing model, it is necessary to add an assumption concerning the distributional
behavior of stock returns. Since Bachelier (1900) the traditional and most widely
adopted distributional assumption on financial return process has been the Gaussian
assumption. Due to the influential works of Mandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965),
however, the -stable distributions with 0 <  < 2 have often been considered to
be a more realistic distribution assumption for asset returns than that of a normal
distribution, because asset returns are typically fat­tailed and excessively peaked
around zero--phenomena that can be captured by -stable distributions with  < 2.
This is the so-called stable Paretian assumption. In a certain sense the stable Paretian
assumption is a generalization rather than an alternative to the Gaussian assumption.
Indeed, according to the generalized central limit theorem, the limiting distribution
of the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed (iid) random
variables is -stable with 0 <   2; see Zolotarev (1986). For more applications of
2
the -stable distributions in economics and finance; see Rachev et al (1999), Rachev
et al (2000) and Kim (2000).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our new
estimator and analyze the asymptotic distribution of the estimator. Section 3 summa-
rizes various scenarios by the different  for regressors and disturbances. In Section
4 we discuss the choice of the optimal  in the new estimator both analytically and
numerically. In Section 5, using simulation and response surface analysis, we present
both the limiting and finite-sample distributions of our new estimator. Section 6
contains some concluding remarks.
2 Rate of convergence and the limiting distribu-
tion for the regression coefficient estimator
Consider a simple regression model like the one below.
Yj
= Xj
+ Uj
, j = 1, 2, . . . . (3)
We assume that the regressors {Xj
} are iid random variables with polynomially
decaying tails. Specifically,
P(|X1
| > )  D1
-x ,   , some x
> 0 and D1
> 0. (4)
Furthermore, we assume that the noise (disturbances) {Uj
} are also iid random vari-
ables, which we assume to be symmetric, with
P(|U1
| > )  D2
-u ,   , some u
> 0 and D2
> 0. (5)
We assume, further, that the sequences {Xj
} and {Uj
} are independent.
Note that no assumptions on the symmetry of either dependent observations or
regressors are made. We remark, further, that it is relatively straightforward (at
least, away from the boundary cases) to extend the results below to the case where
the tails of the regressors and noise variables are regularly varying (ie adding slowly
varying factors in (4) and (5)). Since such slowly varying functions are not practically
observable, we decided against including extra technical arguments in an already
3
highly technical paper. Finally, we allow values of x
and u
in the interval (0, 1] as
well, since our methods cover those cases equally well.
The goal is to estimate the regression coefficient  in (3), and our estimator is

|Xj

(6)
for some  > 1 with < · > defined as a signed power.2 Note that the OLS estimator
corresponds to  = 2 in (6).
Our immediate task is to understand the behavior of the difference

where the last distributional equality follows from the symmetry of the noise. That
is, we are interested in the rate of convergence of the estimator ^
,n
to the true value
depending on the choice of . When such convergence actually takes place, this will
also establish consistency (in probability) of our estimator.
It is clear that the rate of convergence to zero of the difference n
depends signif-
icantly on the tail exponents x
and u
, and on the choice of . What is interesting
is that we will see below that there are basically 7 different cases of possible values
of x
and u
, in each of which the rate of convergence is a different function of .
A common feature of our results will be the existence of an exponent d such that
ndn
 W as n   (8)
for some non-degenerate weak limit W. Occasionally, on certain boundaries we will
have to modify (8) to allow for a slowly varying factor in the left-hand side. That is,
we will have
ndL(n) n
 W as n   (9)
where L is a slowly varying function.3 In any case we will view the exponent d in
either (8) or (9) as measuring the rate of convergence. In particular, the exponent d
2a<p> = |a|p-1a.

L(x)

and is equal to 1.

turns out to be a different function of  in the 7 different cases of possible values of
x
and u
we mentioned above.
The reader will find it easier to follow the different technical detail below after
noticing the existence of several critical boundaries. The first boundary is that
 - 1

x
> 1. (10)
Note that on one side of that boundary |Xj
|/(-1) has a finite mean and hence the
denominator in (7) is governed by the law of large numbers (LLN). On the other side
of that boundary |Xj
|/(-1) is in the domain of attraction of a positive stable law
and the corresponding heavy-tailed central limit theorem governs the behavior of the
denominator in (7). On the boundary itself, the mean is infinite, but the (weak) LLN
is still in force.
The second critical boundary is that of
min ( - 1)x
, u
> 2. (11)
Here on one side of the boundary the random variables |Xj
|1/(-1)Uj
have a finite
variance and hence the Gaussian central limit theorem (CLT) governs the behavior
of the numerator in the second expression in (7). On the other side of that boundary
these random variables are in the domain of attraction of a symmetric stable non-
Gaussian law and hence the corresponding CLT will be responsible for the behavior
of the numerator. On the boundary itself the variance is infinite, but the CLT will
still be in force.
We now proceed to consider the different ranges of x
and u
mentioned above.
Scenario 1 Suppose that
0 < x
 1 and u
 2. (12)
Note that under this scenario (10) fails independently of . Consider, therefore, the
second part of the critical boundary (11)
( - 1)x
 2 or, equivalently,  
2 + x
x
. (13)
We will see that, in this case, the exponent d governing the rate of convergence of n
to zero in (8) or (9) is given by
d =
2 - ( - 1)x
2( - 1)x
. (14)

Consider first the non-boundary case
u

previous section for the description of the constant C
for 0 <  < 2 (given in (2))

The proof is similar to that of (16) above, but instead of the CLT for triangular arrays
with a finite variance it uses the general CLT for triangular arrays as in, for example,
Theorem 5.3.2 in Laha et al (1979). Recall that here D2

Note that, unlike the limits in (16) and its versions (44), (46) and (48), the
numerator and denominator on the right-hand side of (51) are NOT independent
(and, of course, the numerator in the latter expression is no longer a Gaussian random

equal to ( - 1)x

Keeping K fixed, we have by the symmetry, using the equivalence of different moments

known as the Khinchine inequalities,

Here and in the sequel c is an arbitrary finite and positive constant that does not
have to be the same every time it appears. By the assumption (49) we have

since u
 2. Now (58) follows after letting K   (we are using, once again, the
fact that u
 2) and so we have proved (51).
Scenario 2 Suppose that
0 < x
 1, 0 < u
< 2 and u
 x
. (62)
12
We are now on one side of both critical boundaries (10) and (11), and the different
ranges of  appear here depending on which of the two elements under the minimum
in (11) is smaller. Consider first the range
( - 1)x
 u
or, equivalently,  
u
x
+ 1. (63)
In this case it turns that that the exponent d is given by
d =
u
 - ( - 1)x
( - 1)u
x
. (64)
Again, we start with a non-boundary case
 >
u
x
+ 1. (65)
We claim that here

weakly, with the random variables on the right-hand side of (66) being independent.
Indeed, here
ndn
=
n-1/u n
j=1
|Xj
|1/(-1)Uj
n-/((-1)x) n
j=1
|Xj
|/(-1)
. (67)
The proof is parallel to that of (16). We use the notation of (18), (19), (20) and (22),
while instead of (21) we use, obviously,
^
Nn
= n-1/u
n
j=1
| ^
Xj
|1/(-1)Uj
, (68)
with { ^
Xj
} given by (23). In particular, (25) still holds. We will show now that
^
Nn
 C-1/u
u
D1/u
2
(E[|X1
|u/(-1)])1/u Su
(1, 0, 0) (69)

Nn

D1/u
2
(E[|X1
|u/(-1)])1/u Su
(1, 0, 0) (70)
weakly as n   (see eg Chapter XVII in Feller (1966)), (69) will follow if we check
that
^
Nn
- Nn
n
0 in probability. (71)
13
Now,
^
Nn
- Nn
= n-1/u
jKn()

= n-1/u
jKn()
Uj
| ^
Xj

jKn()
Uj
|Xj

Hence, (71) will follow once we prove that

jKn()

|Xj
|1/(-1) n
0 in probability. (73)
n-1/u
jKn()
Uj
| ^
Xj

Consider (73). Let 0 < p < 1  u

0.
Hence (73) holds, and the proof of (74) is the same, but easier. The rest of the proof
of (66) is the same as that of (16) above.
In the boundary case

the exponent d is still given by (66), and the convergence statement is

The second possibility for the minimum in (11) is the range
( - 1)x
< u
or, equivalently,  - 1 <
u
x
+ 1. (78)
Here, once again,
d =
1
x
,
and (51) still holds, with the same argument.
Scenario 3 Suppose that
0 < u
 1 and u
< x
. (79)
and consider the following 3 ranges for :
 
x
x
- u
, (80)
u
x
+ 1   <
x
x
- u
, (81)
and
 >
u
x
+ 1. (82)
We claim that under (80) n
does not converge in probability to 0. That is, in the
case that the estimator (6) is not consistent.
Indeed, let d be given by (64), and notice that now d  0. Since the reciprocal
of the fraction on the right-hand side of (67) is clearly tight, we see that n
cannot
converge to zero (it is not even tight if  > x
x-u
.)
Consider now the  range (81). Here d is the same as in (64):
d =
u
 - ( - 1)x
( - 1)u
x
.
Now d is positive, and, in the non-boundary case, (66) still holds, with the same
argument, while on the (only) boundary (76) holds in the same way.
Finally, we consider the range (82). Here, once again,
d =
1
x
,
and (51) holds.

Scenario 4 Suppose that
1 < x
 2 and u
 2 . (83)
The first range of  we consider is on one side of the boundary (10)
 
x
x
- 1
. (84)
Here the exponent d turns out to be
d =
1
2
. (85)
Specifically, in the non-boundary case
u
> 2 and  >
x
x
- 1
, (86)
we actually have
ndn

(E[|X1
|2/(-1)])1/2(E[U2

E[|X1

N(0, 1) (87)

j=1

n-1 n
j=1
|Xj

, (88)
and the strong LLN applies in the denominator, while the CLT for iid random vari-
ables with a finite variance applies in the numerator.
Let us look at the boundary cases. If
u
= 2 and  >
x
x

(89)
then (87) is modified to
nd

(D2

E[|X1

N(0, 1) (90)
by using the general CLT for iid random variables in the numerator (see eg Proposition
5.3.3 in Laha et al (1979)).
In the second boundary case
u
> 2, x
> 2 and  =
x
x
- 1
(91)
16
the CLT for iid random variables with a finite variance still applies in the numerator
in (88), but the finite law means LLN no longer holds in the denominator. Instead,
we will use the weak LLN
1
n log n
n
j=1

convergence result

The next boundary case is
u
> 2, x
= 2 and  =

x

Here we use both the general CLT for iid random variables and the weak LLN (94)
and obtain

Similarly, in the boundary case

(96)
we have
nd (log n)1/2 n

(D2

Finally, in the boundary case

(98)
we will have

still on the same side of the boundary (11)

x

. (100)
17
The exponent d here is given by (14):
d =
2 - ( - 1)x
2( - 1)x
and, in fact, in the non-boundary case (15), the convergence result (16) holds, with
the same argument as before, whereas in the three boundary cases (43), (45) and
(47), we obtain the convergence results (44), (46) and (48) respectively, once again
with the same argument as in Scenario 1.
Finally, consider the range of  on the other side of the boundary (11):
 <
2 + x
x
. (101)
Here, the exponent d is given by (50):
d =

x
,
and as above, the convergence result (51) holds.
Scenario 5 Suppose that
x

Once again, we start with  on one side of the critical boundary (10):

Here it turns out that
d = 1 -

Consider first the non-boundary case

In the boundary case

and with the same treatment of the denominator, we need to use the version of the

In the second range of  we consider, as we are now on the other side of the critical
boundary (10),
u

x
x-1
(112)
(note that this range is non-empty only if u
< x
/(x
- 1).) Here, we take
d =
u
 - ( - 1)x
( - 1)u
x
. (113)
In fact, the convergence results obtained here are (66) in the non-boundary case
(65), and (76) in the boundary case (75), all with the same arguments as above.
In the final range of  we preserve the side of the critical boundary (10) we are
on, but the relationship between the heaviness of the tails of the random variables
under the sum defining the numerator of n
in the second equality in (7) changes:
 <
u

Here the exponent d is again given by (50),
d =

x

19
and, as before, we obtain the convergence result (51).
Scenario 6 Suppose that
x

The first range of  we consider puts us on one side of the critical boundary (11):
 
2 + x

Here d is given by (85):
d =

Specifically, in the non-boundary case

we have the convergence result (87). In the boundary case

The second range of  we consider puts us on the other side of the critical boundary
(11), but keeps us on the same side of the critical boundary (10):
x

It turns out that in this case the exponent d is given by
d =

Consider first the non-boundary case

By using the CLT for sums of iid random variables with a finite variance in the

we immediately obtain

The first range of  specifies which of the two elements under the minimum in

4 What  should one use?
The knowledge of x
and u
allows us, from the results obtained above, to select
the  that leads to the highest possible rate of decay of n
, ie the highest possible
d. In particular, from the plots in the previous section we know that d() is a non-
increasing function of  in Scenarios 1 through 5, and a non-decreasing function of 
in Scenarios 6 and 7.
What  do we choose if the x
and u
are unknown or rather we do not know
them precisely? This is a common situation since the precision of even the best non-
parametric estimators of the tail exponents is not very high; see eg Embrechts et al
(1997).
Clearly, the tighter bounds on x
and u
we have, the easier it is to select a good
. In this section we will consider several possible situations. The reader is invited to
consider additional possibilities. We will only consider the cases x
 1 and u
 1
here, as those are of relevance in empirical analysis.
Suppose first that we know that
x
 1 and u
 2. (138)
Then the choice of
 = 2 (139)
always leads to the highest possible rate of decay of n
, ie the highest possible d.
Indeed, if x
 2, then Scenario 4 is in force (the boundary case x
= 1 does not
distinguish between Scenarios 1 and 4), and, since
2 + x
x
= 1 +
2
x
 2,
we obtain the optimal d = 1/x
. On the other hand, if x
> 2, then Scenario 6 is in
force, and since
2 + x
x
= 1 +
2
x
< 2,
we obtain the optimal d = 1/2.
On the other hand, suppose we know that
1  x
< 2 and 1  u
< 2. (140)
31
Then any choice of
1 <  
3
2
(141)
always leads to the highest possible rate of decay of n
(highest possible d). Indeed,
Scenario 5 is in force and
u
x
+ 1 >
1
2
+ 1 =
3
2
 ,
and we obtain the highest possible value of d = 1/x
.
Note that in the above cases, and with the choice of  we are recommending, we
will always have d  1/2.
Unfortunately, in the range 1  u
< 2, if x
can be bigger than 2, no such
efficiency is possible.
To measure the relative efficiency of a given choice of , let us introduce the
notation
R(; x
, u
) =
d(; x
, u
)
d(x
, u
)
, (142)
where d(; x
, u
) is the value of d corresponding to , x
, u
and
d(x
, u
) = max
>1
d(; x
, u
). (143)
For a set A of (x
, u
) let
A
() = inf
(x,u)A
R(; x
, u
) (144)
be the worst efficiency of a given choice of . We may then look for a maxmin value
A
such that
A
(A
) = max
>1
inf
(x,u)A
R(; x
, u
) := RA
. (145)
If A  (2, ) × (1, 2), then RA
= 0.
Indeed, for a given  > 1, choose x
so large that x
/(x
- 1) <  and let u
 1.
Then we will be eventually within Scenario 5, and
R(; x
, u
) =
1 - 1/u
1/x
- 0.
Hence A
() = 0 for all  > 1, and so RA
= 0, as claimed.
If, however, x
cannot be arbitrarily large, then things are better.
32
Let  > 2, and
A = [1, ] × [1, 2). (146)
Then any  in the range
1 <  
2 + 2
2 -  + 2
(147)
is a A
. Furthermore,
RA
=
2

. (148)
To prove this, consider first the range
 >

 - 1
.
Here, as in the case A = (2, ) × (1, 2), we see that A
() = 0. Next, we consider
the range
 + 1

<  

 - 1
(149)
Note that
inf
(x,u)×A
ux/(x-1)
R(; x
, u
) =

 - 1
-  (150)
and is achieved when x
 , u
 1. On the other hand,
inf
(x,u)×A
u>x/(x-1)
R(; x
, u
) =
2

(151)
and is achieved when x
 , u
 2. Therefore, in the range (149)
A
() = min

 - 1
- ,
2

=
2

(152)
if ( + 1)/ <   (2
x
+ 2)/(2
x
- x
+ 2). Furthermore, A
() < 2/ if (2
x
+
2)/(2
x
- x
+ 2) <   /( - 1).
Similarly in the range
1 <  
 + 1

, (153)
we obtain, in a similar way, that
A
() =
2

, (154)
Therefore, both (147) and (148) follow. In this situation we can guarantee d  2/()2
with the choice of  recommended above.
33
The above discussion of the ways to select the parameter  focuses on the rate of
convergence to the true value, which is, clearly, the single most important criterion.
With the rate of convergence kept fixed, however, other things become important.
Among them is the spread of the limiting distribution. To compare such spreads and,
hence, to be able to tell more about good ways to select , we performed a simulations
study.
Design of simulation. From the viewpoint of empirical evidence, we consider
x
 [1, 2) and u
 [1, 2). To implement data-generating processes, we have selected
x
, u
= 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.99.4 For sample size we choose n = 50, 100, 250, 500,
1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and , where the limiting distributions are calculated
from Scenario 5. We use a length of quantile 0.975
- 0.025
as a spread measure,
where p
is the pth quantile of the simulated distribution of (7).5 According to the
recommendation in (141), we use   (1, 1.5]. For implementation we have selected 
= 1.05, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5. To determine simulated densities
for each estimate, 10,000 replications were made. Figure 9 shows the  minimizing
the spread for selected x
, u
and sample sizes.
The selected  shows noticeable irregularity, even for large samples. Nevertheless,
some useful rules for choosing the  can be formulated as
 =





u
if u
< 1.5
1.5 if u
 1.5
Here, the parameter u
plays a key role, while the role of x
and the sample size seem
to be less important.
4In order to better see the behavior of the estimates near the boundary points 1 and 2, a more
detailed selection was used in another simulation. The results show that the transition from 1 to
numbers bigger than 1 (1.01 and 1.05 were additionally chosen in the simulation) and from 2 to
numbers smaller than 2 (1.99 and 1.95) is smooth.
5The results are very robust against taking other quantiles and other spread measure such as
variation; see Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994, Ch 2) for an explanation of the variation.

5 Limiting and finite-sample distributions of n
under Scenario 5
In this section we consider the most interesting scenario in practice, Scenario 5. Since
the limiting distribution in (51) is a non-standard one, we perform simulations and
response surface analysis and give both the limiting distributions by given x
and u
,
and finite-sample distributions.
5.1 Limiting distributions of n
The behavior of the limiting distribution in (51) based on Scenario 5 is numerically
analyzed. Figure 10 shows simulated limiting distributions for selected x
and u
.
For this simulation we used  according to the choice rule described above.
A comparison of the limiting distributions for various x
and u
shows that they
become more dispersed if u
decreases or x
increases. For example, 0.0113, 0.0032,
0.0017 for u
= 1.0, 1.5, 1.99, respectively, for a given x
= 1.5, and 0.0366, 0.0032,
0.0001 for x
= 1.99, 1.5, 1.0, respectively, for a given u
= 1.5. For the spread of the
limiting distributions, x
plays a more important role than u
.

Figure 10: Simulated limiting distributions for selected x
and u
Rather than simply tabulating critical values for a few selected sample sizes, x
­
values and u
­values, we employ response surface techniques to present our simu-
lation results in a compact fashion. In addition, this approach allows us to derive
approximate critical values for wide ranges of x
­ and u
­values and facilitates com-
putational implementation. Response surface methodology has been used in various
statistical and econometric applications (see Myers et al 1989).
Response surface analysis was applied to approximate selected quantiles of the
limiting distributions n
given in (51) generated from the 10,000 replications. Specif-
ically, we focused on the 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 99% quantile values and, hence,
for the fitting of a response surface, on the 175 (x
, u
, q)­combinations considered.
For the surface a functional form was specified, a high­order polynomial in x
, u
and q. Specifically, we estimated
(x
, u
, q) =

To derive the approximate response surface, we selected the subset of regressors which
36
maximized the adjusted­R2 value. To take possible heterogeneity of the approxima-
tion error ,x,u,q
into account, the generalized least squares method was used for
estimation, although there did not seem to be systematic heterogeneity due to varia-
tions of the characteristic exponent . The estimation results are reported in Table 1.

| = 0.0398 indicate adequate fits. As expected,
the absolute goodness of fit deteriorates as the significance level decreases, especially
when x
and u
approach 2.7
6The negligibility of the constant terms justifies the use of the adjusted­R2 value for selecting
the regressor subset. Its use would be inappropriate if the zero restrictions on the constant terms
did not hold.
7To obtain better response surface approximations, simulations with additional intermediate val-
ues for x and u could have been conducted. However, the surfaces turn out to be rather smooth
with respect to both variables, which means additional simulations would have led to only negligible
improvements in the response surface approximations. Selected comparisons between simulations
with intermediate (x
, u)­combinations and corresponding response surface approximations sup-
port this conclusion.
37
5.2 Finite-sample distributions of n
To examine the finite-sample behavior of n
, we simulated samples of length n = 50,
100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5000 and 10,000. Both regressors xt
and disturbances
ut
were drawn from symmetric standard stable Paretian distributions (ie c = 1 and
 = 0) with the characteristic exponent x
and u
assuming values 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75,
1.99,  having been chosen by the rule in the previous subsection. For each of the
200 possible (x
, u
, n)­combinations, 10,000 replications with the same seed were
generated with the algorithm of Weron (1996) as a modified version of Chambers et
al (1976).8
Overall properties of the distributions for finite samples with respect to x
and
u
are similar to those of the limiting distributions. For supplying critical values for
finite samples, response surface analysis was again applied to approximate selected
quantiles of n
generated from the 10,000 replications. Specifically, we focused on
the 1, 5 and 10% critical values and, hence, for the fitting of a response surface
on the 600 (n, x
, u
, q)­combinations considered. For the surface a functional form
was specified, a high­order polynomial in n, x
and u
accompanied by quantiles.
Specifically, we estimated the following regression and the estimated coefficients of
the response surface regression are summarized in Table 2.

mean |^
| = 0.0613 and max |^
| = 0.7816 indicate adequate fits. As expected, the
absolute goodness of fit deteriorates as the significance level decreases, especially
when x
and u
approach 2.
Next, we use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check how close the finite-sample dis-
tributions of n
are to the limiting distributions. Figure 11 shows the QQ plots of the
empirically estimated distributions Fn
against the limiting distribution F0

Note that the critical value at the 95% significance level is 1.3851/

n. As is
clearly shown in Figure 11, the finite-sample distributions differ significantly from
39
the limiting distributions even at n = 10, 000. For all cases the null hypothesis
that Fn
= F0
cannot be accepted. For various x
and u
the KS test shows the
same result. This means that for empirical work the limiting distributions is only a
poor approximation of the finite sample distributions, which means we need tables of
critical (quantile) values of each combination of (x
, u
) for a range of sample sizes
n.
6 Concluding remarks
One can see that blindly using the OLS approach  = 2 can lead to very inefficient
estimators of the regression coefficient. A much better approach is to take the tails
into account. Even if the tails of the regressors and disturbances are known only
approximately, this can still provide valuable information for selecting a good value of
 and, hence, constructing a more efficient estimator. Iterated procedures in which the
tails and the regression coefficient are estimated simultaneously should be considered.
