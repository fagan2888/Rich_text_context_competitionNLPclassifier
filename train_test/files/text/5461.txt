Introduction
During the last three decades, natural resource management
policies have changed dramatically from a pure "preserva-
tionist model" or a "fences and fines" approach, to more
decentralized approaches (Gibson & Marks, 1995; Hulme &
Murphree, 2001; Songorwa, 1999). Participation and bene-
fit sharing has been a popular strategy designed to offset
conservation costs and motivate local people to support con-
servation (Archabald & Naughton-Treves, 2001; Scherl et
al., 2004) by aligning their behavior with conservation goals
(Borrini-Feyerabend, Banuri, Farvar, Miller, & Philips,
2002; Gibson & Marks, 1995; Hulme & Murphree, 2001;
Scherl et al., 2004). Many national governments, develop-
ment partners, and conservation multinationals argue for
participatory approaches (Inamdar, De Jode, Lindsay, &
Cobb, 1996) as they engender win-win outcomes through
environmental management and economic development
(Benjaminsen & Svarstad, 2010).
Participatory approaches have been implemented for
about three decades, however they seem to have yielded
mixed results (Barrett, Lee, & McPeak, 2005; Gibson &
Marks, 1995, Newmark & Hough, 2000; Wang, Lassoie, &
Curtis, 2006). The extent to which these approaches secure
local people's support for conservation may depend on the
degree of involvement and the scale of benefits accrued
(Child, 2003). In addition, success will depend on the
protected area goals, objectives, methods, and mission
(Mannigel, 2008), and the ability of protected area "manag-
ers to reconcile biodiversity conservation goals with social
and economic issues" (Andrade & Rhodes, 2012, p. 1).
In Tanzania, the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism (MNRT) adopted locally based and decentralized
approaches to natural resources management from the late
1980s, following the economic crisis of the late 1970s to the
early 1980s and the resulting declining capacity of govern-
ment agencies (Nelson & Blomley, 2010). The intention was
to involve local people in the management of natural
resources and for them to influence management decisions
while benefiting directly from conservation. The two sectors,
forests and wildlife, underwent policy reform processes in
the 1990s. They used various techniques and approaches
with the intention of creating good relationships through
influencing local people's attitudes and perceptions, to
engender support for biodiversity conservation (Hulme &
Murphree, 2001; Newmark & Hough, 2000). Individual

Conservation With a Human Face?
Comparing Local Participation and
Benefit Sharing From a National Park and
a State Forest Plantation in Tanzania
Sayuni B. Mariki1
Abstract
Participatory approaches to natural resources management have evolved as a way to secure local people's support for
environmental conservation. This study compares participatory approaches used by a national park and a state forest plantation
in Tanzania. It shows how in similar settings, various parts of the State pursue various policies that affect communities in
different ways. The extent of participation and amount of benefits accrued are found to have a paramount role in determining
local people's attitude to conservation. Local communities do not generally regard the national park as being beneficial, while
the forest plantation is regarded as an important means for their survival. The failure of the park to allow meaningful local
participation and equitable sharing of the park's benefits with affected local people, is leading to hatred, resentment, and illegal
harvest of natural resources from the park.

studies from these sectors reveal that success so far has been
limited (e.g., Benjaminsen & Bryceson, 2012; Brockington,
2007; Holmes, 2003; Kideghesho, 2006; Vihemäki, 2005).
There are few studies that have closely compared the perfor-
mance of these sectors in meeting participatory objectives
(e.g., Nelson & Blomley, 2007, 2010), although these studies
focus more on community-based forestry and community-
based wildlife management. Studies that compare both sec-
tors by focusing on national parks and forest plantations,
especially when they affect the same people, are lacking in
the academic literature.
This article investigates how participatory approaches
used by the Kilimanjaro National Park (KNP) and the West
Kilimanjaro Forest Plantation (WKFP) influence local com-
munities' reactions toward the study areas. KNP is managed
by the Tanzania National Park Authority (TANAPA), while
WKFP (60.19 km2) is managed by the Tanzania Forest
Services Agency (TFSA)--formerly the Forest and
Beekeeping Division (FBD). The national park was signifi-
cantly expanded in 2005 after the inclusion of a forest reserve
(1,078 km2) that had been managed by the FBD through
Joint Forest Management (JFM). The inclusion of the forest
reserve was associated with changes in institutions, the legal
framework, distribution of powers, authority, resources, and
changes in natural resource management agents. This transi-
tion reflected substantial changes in the relationships
between people and the State, and between people and the
park, in terms of natural resource access and rights.
The reason for selecting these two areas is that they have
more or less the same location and therefore concern some
of the same local people. Both areas experienced the para-
digm shift from fortress conservation to community conser-
vation (Hulme & Murphree, 2001). According to the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
classification, KNP is classified in category II (an area man-
aged mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation) and
WKFP is not included in the IUCN category system.
According to Dudley (2008), forests that are commercial,
that is timber plantation of exotic species and as such, do not
constitute a forest protected area. Exploring the performance
of these two areas in terms of participatory approaches can
shed light on how they can improve the relationship with
adjacent local communities.
The park and forest plantation involve and benefit local
people in very different ways. At KNP the withdrawal of
natural resources is prohibited, however the park benefits
local people through community development projects. For
example, park management involves local people in extin-
guishing a fire during any incident of fire outbreak in the
park. At WKFP the management allows local people to;
collect some forest products, participate in the logging busi-
ness (for registered customers), provide casual labor for vari-
ous activities in the plantation, and engage in farming
activities through the taungya1 system (commonly known as
the shamba system in East Africa). As with KNP they are
also involved in helping during fire incidents in the forest
plantation. This article argues that the level of participation
and benefits applicable to the livelihoods of local people
affect the way local communities react toward the national
park and the forest plantation.
The next section discusses the concept of "participation,"
followed by a description of the study area, the methods of
data collection and the data analysis. Then the findings are
presented before moving on to the discussions and
conclusions.
What Is "Participation"?
The term participation is well debated and discussed in
development and conservation literature (e.g., Agarwal,
2001; Cleaver, 2001; Hickey & Mohan, 2004; Mohan &
Stokke, 2000). The term has been used in many contexts and
is understood in a variety of ways (e.g., Reed, 2008; Rowe,
Marsh, & Frewer, 2004; Wilcox, 2003). In this study the term
participation is defined following Hoben, Peters, and
Rocheleau (1998) definition as a process through which dif-
ferent stakeholders influence, share, and keep control over
development initiatives and over decisions and resources
that affect them.
Local people's participation in development and conser-
vation has enjoyed general acceptance among various actors
in recent decades. Nevertheless, despite its acceptability, par-
ticipation in development continues to attract criticism (e.g.,
Cooke & Kothari, 2001; Diamond, Nkrumah, & Isaac, 2004;
Hickey & Mohan, 2004). For example, some scholars who
support the concept (e.g., Diamond et al., 2004; Mannigel,
2008; Ribot, Chhatre, & Lankina, 2008) argue that participa-
tion can be used as a means (method) to promote more effi-
cient (effective, cheap) management or as an end to enhance
equity and empowerment. Cooke and Kothari (2001), how-
ever, argue that not only is participation unable to facilitate
meaningful social change it largely maintains existing power
relations through masking this power behind the rhetoric and
techniques of participation. Mohan and Stokke (2000) fur-
ther argue that participatory approaches tend to neglect local
power relations and inequalities (as they consider local com-
munities as homogeneous entities), and underplay the role of
broader political and economic forces.
There are several degrees of participation ranging along a
continuum from nominal, passive, informing, giving options,
active functional, interactive, and taking responsibility
(Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996; Diamond et al., 2004; Mannigel,
2008; Pimbert & Pretty, 1997). When put into consideration
the logic of "acting together" or "taking part," the extremes
"nominal," "passive," and "taking over management respon-
sibility" are not considered particularly participatory. This is
because at those levels, local people and institutions are only
distantly involved in management and decision-making
activities (Mannigel, 2008, p. 500). The same author argues
that, in rural development and in nature conservation studies,
Mariki 3
the activities on these three levels are commonly referred to
as participatory.
In terms of natural resources management, participatory
approaches assume that, if local communities participate in
the management of natural resources and/or benefit they will
be more likely to support conservation (McNeely, 1995;
Wells & Brandon, 1992). However, several studies have crit-
icized participatory approaches in natural resources manage-
ment for failing to achieve their goals in terms of devolving
decision-making powers to and/or benefiting local people
while promoting conservation (e.g., Barrett, Brandon,
Gibson, & Gjertsen, 2001; Nelson, 2010; Newmark &
Hough, 2000; Sachedina, 2008; Songorwa, 1999).
The extent to which people participate in natural resources
management depends on the approach used by conservation
institutions, which largely is determined by the extent of
power sharing, in this case, between the State and commu-
nity (E. Barrow & Murphree, 2001; Pimbert & Pretty, 1997).
Weber (1919) defines a State as the "human community that
(successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of
physical force within a given territory." The same author
notes that the State may ascribe to other institutions or to
individuals the right to use physical force only to the extent
to which it permits such use. For example, power can be
ascribed to natural resources institutions to regulate access
and control of resources, or provide rules defining the distri-
bution of benefits. Thus, the State controls the activities of
institutions and their members through legislation, policies,
regulations, and strategies that encompass binding rules
(Chazan, 1994).
With regard to State and local participation in natural
resources management in Tanzania, the government2 through
its parliament makes official decisions concerning natural
resources management policies, and Acts that legalize the
management of natural resources, and participation of differ-
ent stakeholders. Different institutions under the MNRT
manage all renewable natural resources. For instance, wild-
life resources fall under three conservation institutions:
TANAPA that manages national parks and has its own ordi-
nance and policy; Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority
that manages Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) and has
its own guideline; and Wildlife Division that manages wild-
life outside national parks and NCA and has its own policy
and guidelines. All responsible institutions for wildlife man-
agement use the Wildlife Act of 2009. However, the TFSA
manages the forest sector and has its own Act and policy. All
these legal documents have aspects of how local people
should participate and benefit from natural resources.
The common participatory approaches used by these
institutions include protected area outreach program prac-
ticed by TANAPA, community-based natural resources man-
agement practiced by Wildlife Division and TFSA, and
co-management regimes practiced by TFSA. Tumusiime and
Vedeld (2012) argue that success of these participatory initia-
tives may depend on the extent of involvement, amount of
benefits accrued, and distribution. Studies elsewhere reveal
that benefit sharing initiatives face a number of challenges
such as corruption, lack of transparency (Cooksey, 2011;
Jansen, 2009; Nelson, 2010, 2012; Sachedina, 2008) rarely
generate significant benefits or deliver sustainable alterna-
tive local livelihoods (Cernea & Schmidt-Soltau, 2006;
Hackel, 1999). Additionally they are not always equitably
shared within communities (West, Igoe, & Brockington,
2006; Kiss, 2004) as illustrated in Uganda (Tumusiime &
Vedeld, 2012), Tanzania (Kideghesho, 2006), Kenya
(Norton-Griffiths & Said, 2010), and Madagascar (Ferraro,
2002).
This article considers these issues in theory and in prac-
tice by exploring the case of KNP and WKFP.
Method
The Study Area
KNPis one of 15 parks inTanzania managed by theTANAPA.
The park was formerly known as Mount Kilimanjaro Forest
and was protected by the German Colonial Government
under the Forest Conservation Ordinance of 1904 (Kivumbi
& Newmark, 1991). In 1940, it was gazetted as a forest
reserve by the British Colonial Government under the Forest
Ordinance of 1921 for water catchment and forest products.
In 1941, the colonial government approved a half-mile forest
strip (HMFS) of 0.8 km wide (area of 87.69 km2), as a buffer
zone between the forest reserve and the more densely popu-
lated villages along the southern lower slopes of the moun-
tain. The motive was to provide local people with firewood,
fodder, building poles, wood and non-wood products. This
strip was managed by the local Chagga Council (Kivumbi &
Newmark, 1991).
In 1973, the mountain above the tree line ~2700 m was
reclassified as a national park, covering an area of 753.81
km2. The remaining part of the forest reserve (1,078 km2)
continued to be managed by the FBD without local participa-
tion. However their management was ineffective and led to
continual deforestation. In response to this problem and fol-
lowing the decentralization policies in the 1990s, the New
Forest Policy was formulated in 1998, which among other
issues emphasized participatory management and decentral-
ization (United Republic of Tanzania [URT], 1998). Thus,
FBD established Community-based Forest Management in
which communities are managers and owners of forests, and
JFM in which local communities co-manage forest reserves
with central and local government authorities (URT, 1998).
Subsequently, JFM was adopted in the Kilimanjaro Forest
Reserve with local people participating in management and
benefiting from the reserve (Tanzania Specialist Organization
on Community Natural Resources and Biodiversity
Conservation [TASONABI], 2001 ). However, in September
2005, the forest reserve and some parts of the HMFS were
annexed to the park after the survey report that revealed
4 SAGE Open
major threats to Mount Kilimanjaro in the form of logging,
fires, charcoal burning, shamba (farm) practices, livestock
grazing, forest villages (squatters), and landslides
(Lambrechts, Woodley, Hemp, Hemp, & Nnyiti, 2002, p. 5).
Currently, the park covers an area of 1831.81 km2
(Kilimanjaro National Park Authority [KINAPA], 2006).
The main activities allowed in the park are non-consumptive
tourism, education, and research. Mount Kilimanjaro
(5,963 m altitude) is one of the major attractions in the park.
The park borders 90 villages, all of which are included in the
park's outreach program. The TANAPA outreach program
also known as Community Conservation Services (CCS)
was initiated in 1988 with the help from the African Wildlife
Foundation. The aim was to build good relationships between
parks and the local communities surrounding them. The CCS
program is based on the motto "good neighborliness"
(Goldstein, 2005; TANAPA, 1994). The 1994 National Parks
Policy stresses that "the outreach program will be accompa-
nied by mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of conserva-
tion are shared with local communities in appropriate ways"
(TANAPA, 1994). The CCS was adopted in KNP in 1994
(KINAPA, 1995).
To the north and north-west of Kilimanjaro, beneath the
natural forest and village land, there were forest plantations
established in 1926 and 1954 respectively, during the colo-
nial period (for timber and poles production) and expanded
after independence in 1961. The total area of plantations to
the north-west of Kilimanjaro (WKFP) is 60.19 km2 (Ngaga,
2011). Of the 60.19 km2, only 44.58 km2 is covered with
trees (TASONABI, 2001). The remaining area consists of
catchment forest areas, steep slopes, valley bottoms, hills
and water sources (WKFP, 2008). WKFP was established
through the taungya system to licensed cultivators. It is
owned by the Government of Tanzania and managed by the
TFSA.
To incorporate the participatory aspects in WKFP after
the Forest Policy of 1998, the plantation management in col-
laboration with FBD explored JFM opportunities
(TASONABI, 2001). However, interviews with forest plan-
tation management revealed that the mode of operation of
the plantation did not support JFM. In addressing the partici-
patory issues, the management objectives of the plantation
were modified to include: the production of non-wood prod-
ucts, which are harvested by local communities; local par-
ticipation in management; and benefiting from the plantation
(TASONABI, 2001).
Mount Kilimanjaro is characterized by a bimodal rainfall
pattern, with long rains from March to May, and short rains
from October to December. The rainfall varies with altitude
and ranges from 2,300 mm at lower altitudes (the forest belt)
to less than 200 mm at the summit (The United Nations
Environment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring
Centre [UNEP-WCMC], 2009).
The Chagga are the largest ethnic group on the southern
and eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. Ethnic groups,
such as the Maasai, the Safa, the Pare, and other small groups
are found on the western and northern parts of the mountain.
The slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro are now occupied by more
than one million people (Hemp, 2006). The annual popula-
tion growth rate for the Kilimanjaro region was 2.9% during
the1988-2002 inter-censal period (Population Planning Unit,
2005). Due to the high population density and land scarcity
along the mountain slopes, zero-grazing is practiced by many
people, which means that the forest is the main source of fod-
der for domestic animals.
This study was conducted in three villages, namely,
Namwai, Engare Nairobi, and Matadi. They are located on
the western side of Mount Kilimanjaro in the Siha Division.
These villages (former squatters) were officially registered
by the government in the 2000s. All the villages are adjacent
to KNP and close to WKFP. They are included in the park's
neighborliness list. Some members of these villages were
evicted from the natural forest in 2006 and from the forest
plantation in 2007. The population of the three villages was
23,411 in 2009. The main economic activities are small-scale
farming, small-scale livestock keeping, small-scale business,
timber/log business, casual labor in plantations, formal
employment, and a few villagers assisting tourists as porters.
Many villagers practice the taungya system in the forest
plantation (Figure 1).
Data Collection and Analysis
Empirical data was collected during different periods
between 2009 and 2012 (8 months of field work in total).
Initially, the study sought to investigate the KNP outreach
program and therefore first interviewees were purposefully
selected such as village government leaders, villagers (males
and females aged 18 years old and above), the park's out-
reach warden, the park's protection warden, and tourist por-
ters. The local people who were interviewed reported a
negative relationship with the park and indicated the forest
plantation as a good neighbor. This observation prompted to
study theparticipatory approaches and benefit sharing
schemes used by the KNP and WKFP. In the follow-up field-
work villagers, village government leaders, the forest planta-
tion manager, forest plantation staff, former forest reserve
staff, and former village natural resources committee mem-
bers were purposefully selected and interviewed. The inter-
views were qualitative, semi-structured, prepared specifically
for the interviewees, and conducted in Swahili, i.e. a lan-
guage understood by most of the people in the study area.
Atotal number of 68 people (37 men and 31 women) were
interviewed in this study. The interview sessions lasted
between 1 and 2 hr each. Saturation point was reached when
consequent interviews revealed no new information regard-
ing the study topic. Interviews were supplemented with
informal discussions with different people, participant obser-
vation, and focus group discussions with 6 to 10 people in
each study village. In addition, the researcher attended the
Mariki 5
village assembly at Engare Nairobi village, and reviewed rel-
evant literature and several studies conducted in the area. On
this basis a lot was learned on how local communities are
involved and benefit from each area.
Each interview began by informing the interviewees about
the research project and seeking their consent to participate in
the study. The participants were encouraged to express them-
selves freely, and were guaranteed anonymity and confidenti-
ality. A notebook was used to record information from the
interviewees, and when permission was granted a tape
recorder was used to record data, which was later transcribed.
The collected data was analyzed by identifying themes and
patterns, organizing them into coherent categories, and link-
ing them to the aims of the study. In addition, statements were
written that could be supported by appropriate illustrative
quotes from the interviews to explain each theme.
Results
The analysis of field data revealed five main themes: the pro-
cess of expansion of KNP, access to natural resources after
inclusion of the forest reserve in the park, local people par-
ticipation in managing the KNP and WKFP, benefit sharing
schemes, and the relationship between local communities,
KNP and WKFP. A description and discussion of each theme
is in the following sections and a comparison summary of the
KNP and WKFP is presented in Table 1.
The Process of Expansion of the KNP
As elaborated in the "Method" section, the Kilimanjaro Forest
Reserve and some parts of the HMFS were annexed to KNP in
2005 after Lambrechts et al. (2002) revealed major threats to
Mount Kilimanjaro. However, the analysis of field data reveals
that KNP did not fully involve local people during the inclu-
sion of the forest reserve into the park. As one interviewee
stated, "the park officials did not conduct any meeting with us;
they passed in some households and took some individuals'
opinions and then considered these as the opinions of all vil-
lagers; something which is false" (Interview no. 7, 2011). The
process was not clear about changes in user rights, restrictions
on entry to the forest, and access to forest resources.

6 SAGE Open
The park demarcated the area without the local people's
involvement, and unfortunately included portions of people's
farmland into the park boundaries. This intensified the con-
flict, which was later resolved by positioning some beacons
in cooperation with villagers and district officials (Interview
no. 7, 2011). The park did not consider the provision of a
buffer zone where communities could harvest forest prod-
ucts (Interview no. 9, 2011). Furthermore, the park manage-
ment dissolved the village natural resources committee and
decided to handle all matters of park management without
the participation of local people (Interview no. 8, 2009).
Whilst the process of expansion of the KNP annexed only the
Kilimanjaro Forest Reserve, the WKFP continued to be man-
aged by FBD under the same objectives as before (Interview,
Natural Resource Officer, 2012).
Access to Natural Resources After Inclusion of
the Forest Reserve in the Park
After the forest reserve was annexed to KNP, entry or har-
vesting any natural products from the park without permis-
sion is considered to be illegal. The park is patrolled by park
rangers. Some women who entered the park illegally
reported being raped, sexually harassed, or had their prop-
erty confiscated. Likewise, men reported instances of being
arrested, beaten, and prosecuted (Interview no. 12, 2011).
Furthermore, restrictions have even been imposed on
searching for lost children or livestock in the forest.
The park staff demands that villagers must wait for them to
come before entering the forest, and in most cases, their
response is not timely (Interview no. 19, 2009). The lack of
cooperation in handling illegal activities in the park seemed
to tarnish the image of the villages and negatively affect
their fund application for development projects as the park
management demands that villages should abstain from ille-
gal activities. Villagers describe this system as "arrest and
send" (kamata peleka; Interview nos. 20 & 21, 2009). Those
who were caught in the forest were mainly: collectors of
firewood, fodder, poles, and plants for traditional medicine;
traditional hunters; farmers (cannabis); and timber splitters
(Interview no. 22, 2009). However, the Park Rangers seemed
to respect permits stamped by village governments and
issued to plumbers working on irrigation canals (Interview
no. 26, 2009).

Based on restrictions imposed by the park, villagers
reported that WKFP is the main hope for their livelihoods.
One interviewee stated, ". . . without this forest plantation,
people could not live here, they would have vacated. . ."
(Interview no. 2, 2009). Villages and nearby towns depend
on the plantation for their firewood needs. The local people
are allowed to collect firewood during thinning and harvest-
ing periods. Fodder harvesting is also allowed, if it does not
take place at water sources. Moreover, people purchase con-
struction poles, participate in the logging business (for regis-
tered customers), and are involved in farming opportunities
in the plantation, and seasonal employment.
The Involvement of Local People in Managing the
Park and the Plantation
At KNP local people are involved in park management
through fire extinguishing exercises. However, they are not
allowed to enter the park before the park rangers arrive. It is
worth noting that fire extinguishing is on a voluntary basis;
thus, no payment or incentive is given other than food. The
villagers claimed that in such exercises they work as a team
with park officials and, thereafter, the relationship ends
(Interview no. 2, 2009; Interview no. 1, 2011). As the park
rangers are paid for fire extinguishing duty the local people
feel that they should also be paid, since they do not have any
share in the forest (Interview no. 4, 2009). To emphasize the
situation, the villagers claimed that the park recognizes them
only in the event of catastrophes (Interview no. 4, 2009).
Such a relationship has caused many people to turn away
from cooperating with the park because they do not regard
themselves as stakeholders in the management of the forest.
The local people compare the current management of the for-
est reserve with the former management under the FBD, as
one village leader asserted,
In those days, many people turned up to extinguish fire because
they knew the reserve belonged to them, . . . but now we have to
convince and force them because they are not paid and do not
benefit from the park. (Interview no. 5, 2011)
At WKFP the situation is different. The plantation man-
agement has created awareness in the surrounding villages
about conservation, fire control, and prevention measures. In
cases of fire outbreaks the communities react quickly to
extinguish the fire and do not demand payment (Interview
WKFP, 2012). However, some interviewees revealed that the
WKFP structure is rigid and they lack participation in deci-
sion making. The following section describes the benefit
sharing schemes used by KNP and WKFP.
Benefit Sharing Schemes
Criteria and procedures.The benefit sharing scheme of the
CCS involves support for community-initiated projects
(SCIP), conservation education, and income generating proj-
ects. SCIP was initiated in 1992 to support social projects of
villages bordering or close to national parks (Goldstein,
2005).
To obtain support from the park, KNP's neighboring vil-
lages have to comply with a set of criteria. These criteria
include: the village should be free from poaching; it should
not have previously been supported by the park; conserva-
tion education has been provided; the village is in close prox-
imity to the park; and the project should be of importance to
the community (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). However, the inter-
views revealed that most of the studied villages lack aware-
ness about the criteria used for selecting projects for support.
The main criterion known by villagers was "proximity to the
park," which they defined as having a "patch of natural for-
est" bordering the park. There was generally a lack of aware-
ness on park matters because the park has not conducted any
meeting in the study villages.
Apart from the criteria, there are established procedures
to follow that include holding a village assembly to select a
project, submitting minutes of the meeting, and presenting
an application letter outlining the reason for the request, the
amount requested, project description, drawings and cost
estimates, while being able to meet about 30% of the project
costs (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). The district authorities must
be involved in these procedures, and the SCIP committee
should approve the project before it is forwarded to national
parks headquarters to be considered for funding. Before proj-
ect implementation a memorandum of understanding has to
be signed between the community, the park and district
authorities (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). The interviews revealed
that some of these procedures are known by village govern-
ment, however they are rarely followed because they are
bureaucratic and top-down. In most cases district level offi-
cials initiate the procedures rather than the communities in
need. For instance, applications for construction of water
intake and a water storage tank in Matadi village, as well as
a secondary school library in Namwai village, were initially
negotiated between the District Commissioner and KNP
before the villages were involved. Other procedures were not
followed (Interview nos. 27, 28, & 50, 2009). Moreover
KNP has only one Park Outreach Warden who has a large
workload in visiting 90 villages and consequently has insuf-
ficient time to assist villagers with any SCIP applications.
At WKFP the criteria for benefiting includes closeness to
the plantation, and the criteria for the allocation of taungya
plots include: health-related aspects (e.g. long periods of
sickness, HIV/AIDS affected persons), age-related factors
(e.g. elderly people), orphans, widows, poor people, planta-
tion staff, and casual laborers who work in the plantation.3
The local people in need of plots register their names with
the respective hamlet leaders. In some instances HIV/AIDs
affected persons, disabled and widows go directly to the
plantation management to seek further attention. No fee is
required to acquire a plot (cf. Dean, 2011).
8 SAGE Open
As in the case of KNP, at WKFP the process also has some
weaknesses. The interview responses revealed some aspects
of favoritism in the process of plot allocation. First, the vil-
lage leadership registered the names of villagers according to
the set criteria, however the plots were allocated to other per-
sons. Even though plantation management sometimes cross
checked the process the problem remained in some villages,
as one widow lamented:
I have been to plantation headquarters and in our village
government office for more than 4 times applying for a plot. I
was given a promise but during the plot allocation exercise, my
name was not in the list . . . I am tired; I have lost hope. (Interview
no. 42, 2012)
Second, some villagers reported that the management in
the forest plantation favors relatives, friends, or influential
people in the community during the allocation of plots; and
some staff engage in corruption by allocating plots to them-
selves where they later sell the user rights,rent out, or give to
relatives or friends.
Benefit sharing. KNP does not share monetary benefits with
local communities. Instead it benefits local communities
through SCIP. During implementation of these projects the
park contributes up to 70% of the project costs and the com-
munity contributes the remaining 30%. Although KNP is not
the most visited national park in Tanzania, it ranks number
one in terms of generating revenue. It generates about 38%
of the total revenue of Tanzania National Parks, followed by
the Serengeti National Park (33%; Kessy, n.d.).This is
because tourists stay in the park longer (while climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro) than those visiting the other national
parks in the northern tourist circuit. Tourists spend money on
accommodation, transport, food, and souvenirs. The infor-
mation from the Tourism Department shows that from 2002
to 2008 KNP generated about 102.1M US$ (about 17M US$
per year).
The revenues collected from KNP and other parks go to
the National Park's headquarters where the "park's opera-
tional budget" is allocated. Only 7.5% of the budget goes
to communities for SCIP. From its inception in 1994 to
2011 (17 years) the KNP's CCS Department has spent
only about 1.6M US$ to support 39 out of 90 villages
neighboring the park. The types of social projects sup-
ported include: construction of public schools and pur-
chase of furniture; construction of cattle troughs, cattle
dips, water tanks, bridges, dispensaries and staff houses;
making energy saving stoves; establishing tree nurseries;
beekeeping projects and women's sewing projects. The
information from National Parks headquarters shows that
in 2007 they earned 56.3M US$, of which only about 1M
US$ (1.8%) was allocated to 15 national parks for out-
reach program activities (TANAPA, 2007, cited in
Tanzania Natural Resource Forum, 2008).
In the study villages only Matadi village was supported in
2002/2003 to construct a water intake and storage tank worth
approximately 13,571 US$. In 2008 the village applied for
support to complete a student hostel project, however it was
not considered by the CCS Department (Interview no. 34,
2009). According to the CCS Warden, the department does
not prioritize projects that had already started claiming that
'they do not know their quality'. The village leadership
reported that the outreach department did not take any initia-
tive to evaluate whether the building project was worthy of
support. Similarly, Namwai village applied for support to
construct a secondary school library. However, the applica-
tion was unsuccessful as the park claimed that it faced finan-
cial constraints (Interview CCS Warden, 2011). From the
time of application in 2009 to August 2011, the communities
had not been informed about the park's decision on their
applications. This was a second attempt for Namwai village
who had applied in 2005/2006 for support to construct a dis-
pensary also without success (Interview no. 28, 2009). Some
interviewees stated that they have lost hope in requesting
help from the park.
The analysis of revenue sharing data from the CCS
Department from 1994 to 2011 shows that Moshi Rural
District had received the most funds (556,940 US$), fol-
lowed closely by Moshi Urban District (455,453 US$).
Although Moshi Urban District does not border the park or
directly bear the costs of conservation, it had received more
funds than other districts that do directly bear the costs of
conservation. A good example is Rombo District who had
received about half (272,727 US$) of what Moshi Urban
District had received. In 2008/2009, Moshi Urban District
received more than half (169,080 US$) of the total SCIP
funds (321,781 US$) allocated for that year. Most of these
funds (148,200 US$) supported a private catholic secondary
school.
Nyeme and Nilsen (2010) point out another example in
which 72% of SCIP funds in 2007/2008 were given to
Mwanga District that does not border the park. This was
made possible through the then MNRT Minister, who was
also a Member of Parliament for that district (Nyeme &
Nilsen, 2010). Not only does the deviation of revenues to
other areas adversely affect the benefits for park neighbors,
the revenue from the higher earning parks, such as KNP, sup-
ports lower earning parks. Furthermore, mishandling and
mismanagement of revenues received by the National Park's
headquarters also adversely affects benefit sharing schemes.
For example, in 2009 the Opposition in Parliament sought a
detailed explanation on the reported misuse of about 5.6M
US$ by National Park's headquarters (Juma, 2009). In addi-
tion, after their 3-year term, the 12 Board of Trustee Directors
each received a lump sum of money (Anonymous, 2006).
Recent criticism of the National Parks headquarters has led
the former Director General to resign.
At WKFP local communities benefit from the forest plan-
tation through forest products such as logs (for registered
Mariki 9
customers), fodder, firewood, construction poles (during
thinning), farming opportunities, and casual labor. Logs are
sold to registered customers from the Kilimanjaro region, the
Arusha region, and some as far away as Kenya. From 2010
to 2012 the number of customers ranged from 35 to 37
(11 customers in 2012 were from the study villages). The
public institutions and the plantation's neighbors purchase
logs mainly for construction purposes. For instance, in
2012/2013, 1,000 m3 of logs were sold to the plantation's
neighbors. From 2008/2009 to 2012/2013, the logs and poles
products ranged between 14,000 and 21,000 m3.
The fee for softwood logs ranges from 1.7 to 32 US$/m3
depending on diameter, length and species type. Softwood
poles are sold at between 0.13 and 0.64 US$ depending on
the diameter and length. This revenue belongs to the govern-
ment. Customers are also charged 7 US$/m3 for softwood
logs for silvicultural activities and road maintenance in the
plantation. This revenue is deposited into the Logging
Miscellaneous Account, managed by the forest plantation.
The forest plantation does not sell logs to community
groups because second and third pruning and tree felling
activities are conducted by the customers themselves. Often,
community groups deny responsibility when these activities
are conducted improperly. Villages in need of logs for social
development activities obtain them from the forest plantation
after seeking permission from TFSA. For individual con-
struction purposes the villagers are expected to purchase tim-
ber from sawmills (Interview WKFP, 2012).
Villagers benefit through casual labor by participating in
various activities that take place in the plantation. For exam-
ple, during the tree planting season people from the sur-
rounding villages, and from further afield, are involved.
They are usually paid 2.5 US$/day and the exercise can take
up to a month. The villagers also participate in security activ-
ities. There are 19 men and 1 woman from the neighboring
villages of Matadi, Engare Nairobi, and Namwai who have
been used as security guards in the plantation. Casual labor is
also needed to water the seedlings planted in the nurseries.
For this exercise the plantation management considers neigh-
boring villages because people are needed to work on a daily
basis and whenever such labor is required. The local people,
mainly men, are also involved in the construction and main-
tenance of plantation roads. In the years 2009/2010,
2010/2011, and 2011/2012, the forest plantation manage-
ment paid 78,321, 73,030, and 77,919 US$ respectively to
casual laborers for various activities in the forest plantation.
Other benefits associated with the forest plantation include
offering transport during sickness and burial ceremony when
the need arises.
The forest plantation also provides farming plots to local
people. The availability of plots depends on the extent of
land available after tree harvesting. Plots vary in size from
30 × 30 m, 30 × 40 m, 40 × 40 m, and 50 × 50 m. Those who
cannot cultivate their plots and those in need of immediate
money sell their plots to rich farmers, while some agree with
others to cultivate the plots on their behalf sharing what is
harvested between them. However, such arrangements are
usually outside of plantation management control.
Small-scale farmers own one to two plots, while large-
scale farmers may own up to 20 plots. Small-scale farmers
and persons who do not have plots are sometimes hired by
large-scale farmers. The small-scale farmers manage to
attend their own plots by setting aside time before or after
working as casual laborers for the large-scale farmers.
Farming is ongoing throughout the year with the main crops
being potatoes, carrots and garden peas and the output from
one plot varies from 5 to 20 sacks. Tree species determine the
length of time a farmer can use the plot. For instance, in plots
growing eucalyptus species a farmer could cultivate crops
for 2 to 3 years. In plots with pines and cyprus species a
farmer could cultivate for up to 4 years, while in less fertile
areas the time could be extended up to 5 years.
Overall, the taungya system has benefited many people
by providing food, cash and employment opportunities. As
one man stated,". . . through the taungya system many peo-
ple have become rich . . . large-scale farmers earn about
28,000 US$ per one farming season"4 (Interview no. 15,
October 2011). However, the local people do not have any
security in terms of the land. In case of destruction of tree
species, the right to use the land could be terminated and
there is no assurance of plot allocation in the future after the
first allocation expires (cf. Dean, 2011). Besides, most per-
sons interviewed expressed fear and insecurity about their
livelihoods in the future. They are concerned that if planta-
tion management should change or the plantation is priva-
tized (accompanied by different policies) they may no longer
have permission to use the land.
The Relationship Between Local Communities,
the Park, and the Forest Plantation
It is beyond doubt that local people depend on KNP for their
livelihood needs, as one interviewee stated, "We want to get
our immediate needs like firewood and fodder first before
development projects . . ." (Interview no. 31, 2011). The lack
of alternatives for their livelihoods results in illegal with-
drawal of natural resources from the forest, as one inter-
viewee remarked:
. . . is it possible for a poor person to live next to the forest
without a buffer zone and watch the forest without extraction of
any resource? . . . it is obvious that extraction will occur illegally
. . . (Interview no. 9, 2011)
Resentment and hatred toward the park have led people to
enter the forest and withdraw natural resources, including
green wood, as one interviewee stated,
They have taken the forest, no entry, no access to forest
resources, and there is no buffer zone . . . it is a big problem . . .
10 SAGE Open
the park has a difficult task to control us from withdrawing the
forest products, and we have a job of watching them--when
they leave we must harvest the resources . . . since we are not
free to access the resources, we do things we were not doing
when the forest was under FBD. (Interview no. 24, 2009)
The village government leader asserted,
. . . We cannot convince villagers to stop illegal activities. We
have to keep quiet because it is not our property. If villagers
benefit from it, they become guards, but now the park restricts
us from entering the forest . . . If someone enters with a saw, will
you arrest such a person? The forest is the way it is today
because we took good care of it. (Interview no. 18, 2011)
The costs of conservation, such as crop raiding and lack
of compensation, also contribute to resentment toward the
park, as one interviewee stated, "Wild animals destroy our
crops so much. If you dare to say or complain they tell you,
you are living in a wildlife corridor. We are not allowed to
kill them or beat them" (Interview no. 18, 2010).
Furthermore, there is a lack of communication between
the park and the people as one interviewee stated, "KNP
works like military army ". . . there is no communication. We
don't know what is going on inside . . . " (Interview no. 45,
2011). These voices imply that the relationship between the
park management and the local people is poor.
Management at WKFP reported that the relationship with
local communities is good. Confirming this, many people
interviewed stated that the forest plantation is a "savior" and
a "true neighbor" who cares for their livelihood needs and
the less privileged in the community. However, some inter-
viewees reported instances of favoritism from community
and plantation management during the allocation of farming
plots.
Comparison of the Park's and the
Forest Plantation's Participatory
Approaches
The results presented above illustrate the process of the
expansion of KNP and its impacts on local people, and dif-
ferent strategies used by KNP and WKFP to involve and ben-
efit local people. However, the performance of the two areas
is different despite the fact that they fall under the same min-
istry. In the following section, I elaborate on the underlying
factors contributing to the differences.
Legal Framework
The performance of KNP and WKFP is partly affected by
sectoral policies and legislation. The legal documents spec-
ify the manner in which local participation and benefit shar-
ing should occur in terms of natural resources management.
However, this study found that the local participation and
benefit sharing strategy used by KNP is more rhetoric than
reality. In practice, the park operates closely under the
"fences and fines" strategy. The park's approach does not
consider the needs of local people and, to a large extent, is a
trade-off where tourism and conservation goals are met at the
expense of local persons livelihood needs. At WKFP the per-
formance of the plantation clearly reflects a win­win situa-
tion where plantation goals, government benefits and local
persons needs are met.
As previously stated, KNP is classified in category II by
IUCN while WKFP does not fall under any IUCN category.
While this may partly explain the difference in the extent of
natural resource access by local people in each area, much is
left to consider in terms of benefit sharing, participation in
decision making, and management of the two areas.
Therefore, these aspects are elaborated further below.
Benefit Sharing
Given the KNP's high income levels one would expect more
benefit sharing and well established relationships with local
people. However, this study finds that several factors have
shaped the benefit sharing scheme. Firstly, National Park's
headquarters applies a set of criteria and procedures for SCIP
application, which are bureaucratic, complex, and lacking
transparency (cf. E. G. C. Barrow, Gichohi, & Infield, 2000).
It is difficult for local communities to follow the required
procedures and in most cases education or assistance is
required, particularly for illiterate groups.
Secondly, the bulk of collected revenues from all national
parks in Tanzania is remitted to National Park's headquarters.
Headquarters channel the operational budget to national
parks and only up to 7.5% of its operational budget is set
aside for outreach programs to surrounding villages that bear
the cost of conservation (see Goldstein, 2005). This system is
different from other countries like Uganda and Kenya where
revenue for local people is derived directly from tourists'
entry fees (e.g. Tumusiime & Vedeld, 2012).
Thirdly, external political influence affects benefit shar-
ing with funds being diverted to areas not directly affected by
the park. Moreover, SCIP applications are sometimes influ-
enced by district level leaders for political gain and credit
(Borgerhoff Mulder, Caro, & Msago, 2007).
Fourthly, the mismanagement and misuse of funds by
National Park's headquarter officials adversely affects the
benefits for local people and the amount of revenue left for
park outreach programs. Inappropriate leakages and corrup-
tion in the wildlife sector have previously been reported
(e.g., Benjaminsen & Bryceson, 2012; Benjaminsen &
Svarstad, 2010; Cooksey, 2011; Jansen, 2009; Nelson, 2009,
2010, 2012; Sachedina, 2008).
Contrary to the KNP benefit sharing scheme, WKFP has
had a more positive impact on neighboring villages. Local
communities benefit through; the logs business (for regis-
tered customers), collection of forest products, engaging in
Mariki 11
income-producing casual labor activities, and the taungya
system. The demand for (fertile) agricultural land has been
met, to some extent, through the plantation's taungya sys-
tem. The application criteria for taungya plots are much sim-
pler than the KNP's criteria and guidelines for SCIP
application. Since the inclusion of the forest into KNP, the
need for forest products has been partly met by the forest
plantation. However, the only type of employment offered is
casual labor and casual laborers are paid very little.
Communities have opted to accept low pay because they lack
alternatives and working for the plantation increases their
chance of obtaining farming plots. Unfortunately, the alloca-
tion of plots has been adversely affected by favoritism.
Similar cases of favoritism in taungya system have also been
reported in Ghana (Agyeman et al., 2003).
Participation in the Management of the Park and
the Forest Plantation
KNP focuses strictly on its structure and has no consider-
ation to local persons contributions toward conservation.
There is no local community member that plays an active
role in park administration or temporary employment. The
park considers local people only when there is a fire out-
break; thus, local people claim that they are used as "tools."
As a result few turn up to help with fire incidents while oth-
ers demand payment. KNP's exclusion of local people from
park management contributes to the negative relationship
that exists between the park and the people. Paraskevopoulos,
Korfiatis, and Pantis (2003) found that social exclusion neg-
atively affects conservation attitudes. WKFP does involve
local people in plantation management through different
activities, and has created positive interaction with sur-
rounding communities. In this case local people participate
willingly to help with fire incidents. However, in both areas
participation is used as a means to improve efficiency in
production and/or conservation. Both areas operate on the
lowest level of the "participation ladder," although the par-
ticipation level of WKFP seems to be higher than that of
KNP. Many of KNP failures/shortcomings coincide with
other protective management studies elsewhere where focus
is on structural barriers toward successful public participa-
tion (e.g., Lachapelle, McCool, & Patterson, 2003; Wilson,
2003).
Participation in Decision Making
KNP and WKFP share a centralized structure in terms of
decision making on matters pertaining to the management of
natural resources and benefit sharing. It is difficult for com-
munities to influence or challenge the operation of the cen-
tral structure. The park management system does not allow
space for local people's opinions because of its top-down and
paramilitary nature. This was revealed during the inclusion
of the forest reserve into the park, as there was no awareness
raising or sensitization about changes of user rights and
hence the process took people by surprise (see Lerkelund,
2011). In addition, only district leaders who make decisions
have been involved in choosing development projects for
support (cf. Borgerhoff Mulder et al., 2007; Durrant, 2004).
There has not been any opportunity for villagers to contrib-
ute to the park's planning and decision-making processes nor
has there been dialogue with park staff to express their prob-
lems and seek solutions (cf. Anthony, 2007; E. G. C. Barrow
et al., 2000). Moreover, most of the revenue collected has
been retained by the National Park's headquarters and local
people have no power or influence over its allocation.
In the case of WKFP, local persons have no power or share
in the revenue collected from logs and poles sold, apart from
payments received for casual labor (cf. Agyeman et al., 2003;
Amoah, 2009). Additionally, they have no influence over the
amount paid for casual labor, nor do they receive any incen-
tive for tending trees. The income from logs sold is remitted
to the central government. Although local people in the forest
plantation are viewed as beneficiaries, they are not involved
in decision making over forest use (cf. Alden Wily, 2002).
Gillingham and Lee (1999) point out that the lack of partici-
pation in decision making shapes local persons perceptions of
protected areas and affects their relationships with govern-
ment conservation institutions and other stakeholders.
Andrade and Rhodes (2012) found that local community par-
ticipation in the protected area decision-making process is
significantly related to the level of compliance with protected
area polices. Silori's (2006) study in India found that lack of
involvement of the local people in the decision-making pro-
cesses and in forest management groups were major causes of
negative attitudes toward protected areas.
Communication and Awareness
There is generally a lack of communication between KNP
and villagers. There has not been any awareness raising
activities to increase public awareness and participation in
conservation efforts. Local persons mainly experience the
negative side of the relationship with the park through fines,
imprisonment, and restrictions (cf. Durrant, 2004). This lack
of communication and conservation awareness about the
park's objectives and mission may contribute to the negative
relationship between the park and local persons. Holmes's
(2003) study in western Tanzania found that the number of
visits of national parks personnel to the village was associ-
ated with positive attitudes. Fiallo and Jacobson's (1995)
study in Ecuador found that low level of awareness regarding
conservation issues was associated with negative attitudes
toward protected areas. Nevertheless, Heinen and Shrivastava
(2009) found that higher level of awareness on regulations
was associated with negative attitudes toward conservation.
Contrary to KNP, the WKFP plantation staff visit villages
and raise awareness about environmental issues and fire con-
trol measures.
12 SAGE Open
Relationship
Some studies argue that the fear of law enforcement officials
reduces anti-conservation behavior (e.g., Aipanjiguly &
Jacobson, 2002). However, this study found that people are
engaged in illegal withdrawal of resources from the park
regardless of patrols by park rangers for the following rea-
sons: lack of, or very few benefits; denial of access to natural
resources; lack of buffer zones to harvest natural resources;
ill-treatment when found in the park; and lack of compensa-
tion for crop raiding. In addition, villagers referred to the
park staff as "enemies" who do not care about their liveli-
hoods (cf.Anthony, 2007). Given the fact that land is a scarce
resource in villages surrounding the park (see Hemp, 2006),
dependence on the park's natural resources for livelihood
needs is unavoidable. Silori's (2006) study in India found
that restricted access to forest resources for local persons
livelihood needs resulted in negative attitudes among them
toward the biosphere reserve. Similarly, Arjunan, Holmes,
Puyravaud, and Davidar (2006) found that exclusion of peo-
ple from a forest to protect biodiversity often antagonizes
local communities.
While local communities bear the costs of conservation
they do not receive any tangible benefits to offset these costs
(cf. Kideghesho, 2006). In addition, the target of benefits
from the park is not immediate nor does it address felt needs.
The scheme tends to focus on infrastructure, which remains
the only testimony of support provided (Redford & Fearn,
2007). Similar findings have been reported by Holmes (2003)
in western Tanzania, revealing that individuals who perceived
active extension services from national parks held more posi-
tive attitudes toward the park than those who did not.
At WKFP benefits obtained by the local people seem to
affect the relationship positively. This is revealed through
local persons responses in cases of fire outbreaks, during tree
planting activities and their corresponding attitude toward
plantation staff. In cases of fire outbreaks, their responses are
quick and they do not demand payment. The community
regards the forest plantation as a "savior" as far as their live-
lihoods are concerned. This is because the plantation is the
main alternative for their livelihoods since the inclusion of
the forest reserve into the park.
Why Do the Park and the Forest Plantation
Perform Differently?
The findings and explanation given above show that KNP
offers limited opportunities for local people to participate
and benefit from natural resources, compared with WKFP.
The difference observed is related to the legal framework
reforms that took place in the 1990s following the country's
economic crisis in the 1980s and the loss of resources and
declining capacity of the central government. Institutional
changes in both sectors (forestry and wildlife) have contin-
ued since the 1990s, however they have not necessarily been
in ways proposed or intended by local proponents of reforms
and/or donors (Nelson & Blomley, 2010). The reforms have
faced resistance due to the interests and incentives that politi-
cal elites, central agencies, and private commercial interests
pose for expanding and/or maintaining control over land and
natural resources (Nelson & Agrawal, 2008). Consequently,
reforms were not carried out as intended because competing
state and private commercial interests considered the
resources "too valuable to allow ordinary citizens to own"
(Alden Wily, 2008, p. 4).
According to Nelson and Blomley (2010), the economic
crisis of the1980s prompted policy makers to implement
wide-ranging policy changes that were more community-
based and decentralized. The process of policy formulation
was dominated by international donors, NGOs, technical
advisors, and government officials within the MNRT. The
same authors argue that, in the forestry sector, donors man-
aged to leverage the process due to FBD's lack of alternative
sources of political power and financial capital. Nevertheless,
in the wildlife sector, donors had very little influence due to
the ability of policy makers to acquire rents from tourism
that provided them with financial assets that enabled them to
deflect reform pressure from donors (Nelson & Blomley,
2010). Consequently, donors failed to bring about the reforms
necessary for positive and direct impacts on rural livelihoods
(Nelson & Blomley, 2010).
Although the two sectors are under the same ministry, the
existing legal framework causes them to work in different
directions indicating that the outputs might be different in
terms of participation levels and benefits channeled to local
communities. Blomley and Iddi (2009) conclude that the
"legal uncertainty caused by the parallel and disconnected
development of wildlife and forest policies and laws results
in inefficiencies and wasted opportunities for poverty reduc-
tion and sustainable land [natural resources] management"
(p. 18).
Conclusions and Recommendations
This article has presented findings on participatory
approaches used by a national park and a forest plantation in
Tanzania. How the park and plantation work and how they
affect the relationship with local people and the resulting
attitudes toward the study areas has been presented.
Conservationists, government officials, and development
partnershavepresentedthenotionofparticipatoryapproaches
as a "win-win" strategy where conservation and local bene-
fits can be combined. Many conservation institutions have
used this strategy to win local people's support for conserva-
tion. However, this study shows that although some aspects
of participatory approaches seem to be typical in KNP, it is
evident that the park operates closely under the "fences and
fines" strategy. This is contrary to the other case of WKFP
where local people are involved and benefit through various
activities in the forest plantation. In both cases, we have seen
Mariki 13
that the extent of local participation and the amount of ben-
efits accrued seem to determine the communities' relation-
ship with the study areas.
Many factors affect the level of participation and extent of
benefits for local people, which can be summarized as fol-
lows. At KNP the factors include bureaucratic procedures for
SCIP applications; lack of, or few benefits; lack of transpar-
ency; deviation of funds; lack of decision making; minimal/
passive participation; and lack of communication and aware-
ness. At WKFP, the factors include lack of decision making,
too little payment for casual labor, corruption in allocating
taungya plots, and lack of revenue sharing from logs sold.
This article highlights that the differences observed between
the park and forest plantation are related to sectoral legal
reforms that occurred in the 1990s following the economic
crisis of the 1980s.
Some issues were raised in the interviews (Table 1) that
the management of the KNP and WKFP can consider to
enhance positive relationships and thus reduce the costs of
conservation. In the case of KNP local people desire regular
positive communication with park staff, tangible benefits
from the park's tourism revenues, and some degree of deci-
sion making over park conservation issues. They also seek
payment in case of fire, if they cannot harvest natural
resources, and a buffer zone in which they can collect natural
resources. At WKFP local people desire the plantation man-
agement to allow community groups to participate in logging
business deals, to benefit in the form of income from logs and
poles sold, and join hands in the plantation management.
The findings of this article show the failure of the park's
participatory approach to create good relationship with adja-
cent communities through local participation in management
and benefit sharing, and the plantations'efforts to build good
relationship with adjacent local people. The findings also
indicate that the extent of benefits received and the degree of
participation used are associated with the negative/positive
attitudes toward the study areas. This article concludes that
for local people to support conservation efforts and resist
illegal activities, the park should allow meaningful local par-
ticipation in park management and equitable sharing in the
park's benefits.

Notes
1. An agroforestry system in which short-term food crops are
grown in the early years of timber plantations to satisfy the
farmer's quest for arable land, control weeds, reduce establish-
ment costs, generate early income, and stimulate the develop-
ment of woody perennial species (Agyeman et al., 2003).
2. Is a group of people presently elected and appointed to run,
manage, and execute the State's programs and policies, and
their specific agencies and powers.
3. Is a motivation strategy, as large-scale farmers pay 11 to 17
US$/day, while the plantation only pays 2.5 US$/day during
tree planting exercises (1 US$ = 1,500 TZS, June 2011).
4. 20 plots × 20 sacks/plot = 400sacks. A sack contains 100 to
120 kg, sold for about 0.7 US$/kg.
