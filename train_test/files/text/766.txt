MEASURING
THE NEED FOR
MENTAL
HEALTH CARE
by Gerald L. Klerman, Mark Olfson, Andrew C. Leon,
and Myrna M. Weissman
Prologue: One of the toughest tasks facing mental health poli-
cymakers and providers is to determine the need for services.
Three streams of research contribute to the search for policy so-
lutions: epidemiology, which addresses the prevalence of mental
illness; clinical research, which addresses the effectiveness of
treatment; and mental health policy research, which deals with
financial and organizational issues. The lead author of this pa-
per, the late Gerald L. Klerman, was uniquely positioned to of-
fer leadership in all three areas. His high standing in govern-
ment and academia lent credibility to his strong insistence that
scientific and policy questions should be viewed separately. De-
fining need for services is a policy question; defining prevalence,
a scientific one. Policy should not be derived directly from sci-
ence, he contended; rather, science should inform policymakers
and aid their decisions. This paper looks at the need for services
from an epidemiologic perspective, in the context of the high
known prevalence of psychiatric conditions throughout the U.S.
population. Before his death in April 1992, Klerman was pro-
fessor of psychiatry and associate chairman for research at Cor-
nell's Department of Psychiatry. He was administrator of the
Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration dur-
ing Jimmy Carter's presidency, before which he conducted and
led psychiatric research at Harvard and Yale. Mark Olfson,
currently an assistant professor of psychiatry at Cornell, re-
ceived his medical degree from Northwestern University and
trained in psychiatry at Yale. Andrew Leon is assistant profes-
sor of biostatistics in psychiatry at Cornell. Myrna Weissman is
professor of epidemiology in psychiatry at the Columbia Univer-
sity College of Physicians and Surgeons and is director of the Di-
vision of Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology, New York State
Psychiatric Institute.

Legislators and government officials consistently place high on the
mental health policy agenda the provision of services sufficient to
meet perceived need. However, opinion varies on what constitutes
need for treatment. Third-party payers, service providers, and sympto-
matic individuals often have very different notions of who should receive
care and under what circumstances. In the area of mental health, where
specialists openly disagree over the fundamental nature of illness and its
treatment, the ground is particularly fertile for dispute over when treat-
ment is necessary or even desirable.
The controversy over need goes to the heart of why we as a society
purchase mental health care. Should we seek to provide treatment to all
persons who suffer from mental disorders? Or should we limit care to
those who are functionally impaired by their condition, or to those who
have a high likelihood of recovering the ability to function? Should
priority be given to people who have the most severe disorders, or to
those whose conditions are most costly to society? Such difficult ques-
tions are central to the ongoing debate over need.
Discussions of need rightfully belong in the domain of political rather
than scientific discourse. Conclusions are ultimately based on values
rather than facts. At the same time, however, research plays an impor-
tant role in informing the decision-making process. Epidemiologic re-
search provides information on the scope of mental illness, clinical
research offers data on the efficacy of available treatments, and mental
health services research describes organizational and financial dimen-
sions of care.
In this paper we examine the need for and use of mental health
services from an epidemiologic perspective. We summarize available
information on the extent of mental illness, its costs to society, and the
degree to which mentally ill persons currently receive mental health
treatment. We close with some thoughts on two general strategies for
narrowing the gap between need for and provision of care.
Expanding The Scope Of Mental Illness
Any effort to measure the extent or range of psychiatric problems
requires consensus on the definition of mental illness. Historically, there
has been a trend toward expanding conceptions of mental illness. In the
nineteenth century mental illness was almost exclusively related to two
conditions, lunacy and idiocy, which are roughly equivalent to what we
now refer to as psychotic disorders and mental retardation. Only gradu-
ally in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was there an
increase in public awareness that large numbers of individuals in the

community, particularly in urban settings, had nonpsychotic or "neu-
rotic" conditions. Neurasthenia, anxiety states, phobias, and depression
became increasingly considered within the scope of mental health and
mental illness. Persons with these conditions were seen as benefiting
from if not requiring mental health care.
Today we see an even further expansion in the range of mental health
concerns. Conditions such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, and
child abuse have become defined as mental health problems. This ex-
pansion is related to the growing secularization of society and an increas-
ing reliance on the health care system. As the United States has become
more urbanized and better educated, psychological-mindedness has in-
creased. With these changes, a growing segment of the population has
sought access to mental health services.
Measuring Mental Illness
Psychiatric epidemiologists concern themselves with studying the dis-
tribution and determinants of psychiatric problems in defined popula-
tions. In recent years psychiatric epidemiologists have employed the
same criteria for mental illness that clinicians use in practice. This
advance has been made possible by two related developments: accep-
tance of a diagnostic system based on observable symptoms (that is, the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, or
DSM-III) and development of structured interviews.
The publication of the DSM-III in 1980 was a landmark event in the
modern history of descriptive psychiatry.1 It provided a reliable diagnos-
tic system to identify individuals with specific mental disorders based on
readily observable psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric researchers devised
structured interviews to apply these criteria to clinical and community
samples.2 The capacity to measure the prevalence of mental illness in
the general population has markedly increased the relevance of psychi-
atric epidemiology to mental health policy deliberations.
The most ambitious psychiatric epidemiologic study to date is the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Epidemiologic Catch-
ment Area (ECA) program. Between 1979 and 1982 over 18,000 adult
residents across five U.S. communities were selected for intensive psy-
chiatric examination.3 The ECA survey remains the most comprehen-
sive source of information on the prevalence of mental illness in the
United States.
Prevalence of mental illness. The ECA survey revealed that diagnos-
able mental illness is highly prevalent in the general population. Ap-
proximately one in six adult Americans (15.4 percent) suffer from a

mental disorder during a single month, one in five (19.5 percent) suffer
from a mental disorder during a six-month period, and one in three (32.7
percent) meet criteria for a mental disorder at some point during their
lives.
Most individuals with mental disorders suffer from conditions not
related to substance abuse. During a six-month period, 15.1 percent of
adults meet criteria for a mental disorder that is unrelated to drugs or
alcohol, 4.7 percent meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, and
2.0 percent meet criteria for drug abuse or dependence.4
When these prevalence estimates are extrapolated to the 1990 U.S.
adult population, the results are truly astonishing. Each month nearly
thirty million adult Americans meet criteria for a mental disorder,
thirty-five million over a six-month period, and sixty million at some
point in their lives. Moreover, many psychiatric researchers believe that
these estimates are conservative. The ECA findings do not include
Alzheimer's disease, childhood or adolescent disorders, generalized anxi-
ety disorder, and many of the personality disorders. The findings also do
not include the large number of persons with low-grade conditions that
fail to reach the diagnostic threshold but nonetheless are correlated with
significant disability.5 However, even without these other conditions,
the ECA data provide dramatic evidence of the vast scope of mental
illness in America.
One strategy for narrowing the scope is to focus solely on persons with
more severe conditions. Mental disorders vary widely in the extent to
which they impair or disable affected individuals. Simple phobias, for
example, have a comparatively high lifetime prevalence (12.5 percent)
but have relatively little impact on quality of life. In contrast, schizo-
phrenia, which has a lifetime prevalence of only about 1.3 percent,
carries a heavy toll on most affected individuals from adolescence
through adulthood. For this reason, prevalence alone does not necessar-
ily provide the most useful guide to the extent or magnitude of mental
illness in America.
NIMH defines persons with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder,
and major depression as having severe mental disorders.6 By this defini-
tion, approximately 4.6 million adult Americans currently suffer from
severe mental illness, and 11.2 million have been so affected at some
point in their lives.7 These numbers provide a more manageable target
for policymakers and mental health planners than the cumulative esti-
mates of mental disorder provide. However, diagnosis is only a rough
index of illness severity.
Functional impairment and duration of illness are other key dimen-
sions of illness severity.8 Some individuals may have "severe diagnoses,"

NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE 27
but it may be misleading to categorize them as severely mentally ill
because their course of illness is not prolonged or seriously impairing. On
the other hand, many individuals, such as those with severe personality
disorders or substance use disorders, may run highly incapacitating
courses of illness.
The ECA survey unfortunately included very few measures of func-
tional impairment. By adding impairment measures to future surveys,
psychiatric epidemiology has an opportunity to increase its relevance to
mental health service planning. In addition to collecting information on
the prevalence of the symptoms necessary to make a diagnosis, it would
be useful to know something about vocational and homemaking role
performance, self-care skills, capacity for independent living, and eco-
nomic self-sufficiency.
Cost Of Mental Illness
Mental illness imposes a substantial economic burden on society.9
Cross-sectional cost estimates provide insight into the size and location
of these expenditures and revenue losses. Any serious consideration of
unmet need requires a familiarity with how society is currently allocating
treatment resources and where it is absorbing financial losses stemming
from mental illness.
Dorothy Rice and her colleagues at the University of California, San
Francisco, have provided the most comprehensive national estimates of
the direct and indirect costs attributable to alcohol, drug, and mental
(ADM) disorder.10 Direct costs are the estimated dollar expenditures
related to the treatment of an illness and typically include expenditures
for institutional care, professional services, medications, and rehabilita-
tion services. Indirect costs include the estimated value of lost produc-
tivity, lost work, and losses due to premature death.
Rice and colleagues estimate that the total national core cost of ADM
disorder was approximately $168 billion in 1985. This is more than $700
per U.S. citizen. Most of these costs are attributable to mental disorders
($99.2 billion), but alcohol abuse ($58.2 billion) and to a lesser extent
drug abuse ($10.6 billion) also account for a significant share.
Indirect costs account for approximately two-thirds of total core costs
($116.6 billion). The indirect costs are largely related to mental illness
($56.7 billion) and alcohol abuse ($51.4 billion) rather than to drug
abuse ($8.5 billion). In contrast, mental illness ($42.5 billion), but not
alcohol abuse ($6.8 billion) or drug abuse ($2.1 billion), accounts for the
vast majority of direct treatment costs. Therefore, in relation to lost
output (indirect costs), society has made a far greater investment in the

treatment of mental disorders than substance abuse disorders. The hu-
manitarian and economic consequences of this national policy are of
critical importance to the debate over unmet need.
Despite a quarter-century of reductions in the number of hospital beds
in state mental hospitals, 58 percent of the treatment cost of mental
illness continues to be for institutionally based care.11 However, only
about 3 percent of persons with a recent mental disorder have ever been
hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.12 It is fair to conclude that the
nation continues to invest far more heavily in the small number of
affected individuals who require institutional care than in the much
larger number of mentally ill individuals who receive ambulatory care or
no care at all.
Use Of Mental Health Care
An important finding to emerge from the ECA survey is that most
individuals with mental disorders do not receive mental health care.13
Even if mental health care is broadly defined to include a single visit to
a general medical provider or a mental health specialist for a mental
health reason, fewer than one in five persons with a mental disorder are
found to have received care during the past six months. Not only are a
large proportion of individuals with less severe conditions not receiving
care, but care is also not being provided to a substantial proportion of
persons with schizophrenia (47-61 percent), affective disorders (68-69
percent), and substance abuse/dependence disorders (82-92 percent).14
Over a six-month period close to thirty million adult Americans with a
mental disorder do not receive any mental health care, of whom ap-
proximately 5.5 million suffer from schizophrenia, bipolar affective dis-
order, and major depression. Thus, how need is defined clearly has a
dramatic impact on how the debate over public mental health resources
is framed.
Seeking care. No straightforward relationship exists between the
presence of a mental disorder and help-seeking behavior. Just as large
numbers of persons with mental disorders do not seek care, so many
mental health visits are made by persons without an apparent mental
disorder. For example, approximately one-third of the persons in the
ECA sample who made a mental health visit during a six-month period
did not have a concurrent DSM-III disorder.15 We need to know more
about the type of distress and disability experienced by this large and
poorly defined group of mental health care consumers.
Need for services should also not be confused with help-seeking
behavior. Access barriers prevent use of services by individuals who

would be recognized as requiring treatment even under the most strin-
gent definitions of need. At the same time, economic research suggests
that some ambulatory mental health care-seeking behavior is discre-
tionary in nature.
Health care seeking is influenced by clinical factors, such as symptoms
and subjective distress, and by predisposing or enabling factors, such as
sociodemographic, geographic, economic, and attitudinal variables,16
The effects of nonclinical factors on use of services are generally contin-
gent upon the presence of some clinical need,
Philip Leaf and colleagues provide evidence that sociodemographic
factors significantly influence mental health services use,17 After con-
trolling for diagnosis, they found that being female, between ages
twenty-four and sixty-five, white, and of higher educational status all
increase the likelihood of making a mental health visit. From a public
policy perspective, therefore, males, the young and elderly, nonwhites,
and those of lower educational status are at increased risk of not receiv-
ing care.
Geographic accessibility to treatment also influences health care seek-
ing. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are dispropor-
tionately concentrated in urban areas. As a result, a majority of U.S,
counties have either very few or no psychiatrists, psychologists, or social
workers,18 Unmet need for mental health services may be particularly
high in rural areas where geographic barriers impede access to care,
Financial factors also affect use of health care. The demand for mental
health services appears to be more price-sensitive than is the demand for
outpatient general medical services,19 Experimental research indicates
that persons assigned to a 50 percent coinsurance plan consume less
than half the ambulatory mental health services that persons assigned to
free care consume. In practice, the elasticity of demand is most evident
in the utilization profile of those who are just above the poverty level.
Individuals who are near-poor--those without Medicaid whose house-
hold incomes are below 150 percent of the poverty level--are at higher
risk than are other income groups of having their needs for mental
health services unmet,20
Personal and public attitudes may also influence mental health serv-
ices use. Public opinion surveys indicate that mental illness is a highly
rejected condition,21 Business managers, for example, have been shown
to view mental illness as unfavorably as ex-convict status and signifi-
cantly less favorably than heart disease, blindness, or paraplegia,22 As a
result of discrimination or devaluation, some individuals may try to hide
the fact that they suffer from a mental illness. Avoidance of necessary
treatment is one tragic consequence of social stigmatization.

30 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Fall 1992
Closing The Gap Between Need And Treatment
Over the past few decades two broad strategies have been advocated
to reduce unmet need for mental health care. One emphasizes the role of
the specialty psychiatric sector, while the other emphasizes the role of
the general medical sector. These two approaches have profoundly dif-
ferent implications for service planning.
Specialists. The first option is to seek to have individuals with ADM
disorders treated by specialists in specialized treatment settings. For
many years this was the goal of federal mental health policy. Large
amounts of federal funds were made available for expansion of the
numbers of mental health professionals and for the development of new
facilities, particularly psychiatric units in general hospitals and commu-
nity mental health centers. However, it became apparent in the 1970s
that this strategy was extremely costly, and doubt surfaced over its
cost-efficacy.
Parallel developments were under way in the general health care
system. The federal government, joined by foundations such as The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, supported the expansion of primary
care. There was an attempt to slow, if not reverse, the tendency toward
medical subspecialization. Analysis of the ECA data confirms earlier
findings that the general medical and specialty mental health sectors are
both substantially involved in caring for persons with mental disorders.23
Generalists. A second option, therefore, would be to expect that not
all individuals with ADM needs would be treated by specialists. Under
this plan, the goal is to enhance the capacity of the primary care sector
to recognize, diagnose, and treat selected ADM disorders. At the same
time, it must be acknowledged that available evidence indicates that the
primary care sector has not shown itself skilled in these clinical roles.
Accumulating evidence suggests that in primary care there is a high
degree of underrecognition, underdiagnosis, and undertreatment of con-
ditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, and alcoholism.24 Mental
health care in the general medical sector is often superficial, and some
health policy analysts warn that casting general medical providers as an
alternative to specialized treatment will reinforce efforts to limit benefits
for specialty care.25
An example of the type of initiative that would be vigorously pursued
if the general medical sector option were chosen is the NIMH Depres-
sion Awareness, Recognition, and Treatment Program (D/ART).26 Un-
der this program, NIMH is assembling workshops and educational mate-
rials to help health providers, including primary care clinicians, recog-
nize and treat depression. The program is modeled after the successful

Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program.27 In this community-
based program, an intensive approach to hypertension treatment re-
duced cerebral-vascular accidents and mortality below the levels experi-
enced by persons who received regular sources of community care.28
If the primary care sector is to play an increased role in providing
mental health care, then the government must make a far larger resource
commitment to this area. Beyond an extensive educational campaign to
involve physicians and other medical staff, an evaluation process would
need to be developed to assess the efficacy of these efforts.
Mental Health Care And Values
Approximately one in five adult Americans meet criteria for having a
mental disorder over a six-month period. The vast majority of these
people do not receive any treatment for their symptoms. For planners of
mental health services, the question arises: What is the relationship
between the high prevalence of mental disorders and the need for
mental health services?
The answer to this question turns on value judgments about the
function of mental health care. To the extent that society purchases
mental health services for humanitarian purposes, unmet need is mas-
sive, and priority should be given to those who have the most serious
conditions and are presumably in the greatest pain.
To the extent that society purchases mental health services for utili-
tarian or economic purposes, policy decisions will be driven by cost/
benefit analyses and considerations about the restoration of occupa-
tional productivity. Because little research currently exists to guide this
line of policy planning, it is not possible to state with certainty how this
policy would redistribute service priorities.29 In general, however, prior-
ity would be given to persons with depression, anxiety disorders, and
perhaps alcoholism who have a significant likelihood of recovering
occupational productivity and improved quality of life.
Epidemiologic data have historically played an important role in
informing U.S. mental health policy. With the development of criteria-
based mental disorders and methods for determining the community
prevalence of these disorders, psychiatric epidemiology has expanded its
role in policy discussions. As measures of functional impairment are
added to diagnostic epidemiologic surveys, the relevance of this research
will continue to increase. By providing quantitative data that relate
directly to the question of need for services, psychiatric epidemiology
enlightens the debate over one of the most important health care policy
issues of our time.
