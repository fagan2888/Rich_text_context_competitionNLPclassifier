Background
The gap between the highest and lowest life expectancies for race-county combinations in
the United States is over 35 y. We divided the race-county combinations of the US population
into eight distinct groups, referred to as the ``eight Americas,'' to explore the causes of the
disparities that can inform specific public health intervention policies and programs.
Methods and Findings
The eight Americas were defined based on race, location of the county of residence,
population density, race-specific county-level per capita income, and cumulative homicide rate.
Data sources for population and mortality figures were the Bureau of the Census and the
National Center for Health Statistics. We estimated life expectancy, the risk of mortality from
specific diseases, health insurance, and health-care utilization for the eight Americas. The life
expectancy gap between the 3.4 million high-risk urban black males and the 5.6 million Asian
females was 20.7 y in 2001. Within the sexes, the life expectancy gap between the best-off and
the worst-off groups was 15.4 y for males (Asians versus high-risk urban blacks) and 12.8 y for
females (Asians versus low-income southern rural blacks). Mortality disparities among the eight
Americas were largest for young (15­44 y) and middle-aged (45­59 y) adults, especially for
men. The disparities were caused primarily by a number of chronic diseases and injuries with
well-established risk factors. Between 1982 and 2001, the ordering of life expectancy among
the eight Americas and the absolute difference between the advantaged and disadvantaged
groups remained largely unchanged. Self-reported health plan coverage was lowest for
western Native Americans and low-income southern rural blacks. Crude self-reported health-
care utilization, however, was slightly higher for the more disadvantaged populations.
Conclusions
Disparities in mortality across the eight Americas, each consisting of millions or tens of
millions of Americans, are enormous by all international standards. The observed disparities in
life expectancy cannot be explained by race, income, or basic health-care access and utilization
alone. Because policies aimed at reducing fundamental socioeconomic inequalities are
currently practically absent in the US, health disparities will have to be at least partly addressed
through public health strategies that reduce risk factors for chronic diseases and injuries.

Introduction
Health disparities in the United States have been the
subject of extensive critical scrutiny and analysis. Multiple
investigations have documented the consistent gap in all
measures of mortality by race, particularly between black and
white Americans [1­5]. Researchers have also drawn attention
to substantial disparities in mortality and functional health
status nationally and within race groups in relation to
income, social class, education, and community character-
istics [6­16]. Inequalities in insurance coverage, health-care
access and utilization, and more recently in quality of care
have also been investigated [17­22]. The Department of
Health and Human Services has launched its Initiative to
Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health, with
programs focused on a number of diseases including
cardiovascular disease, HIV, and diabetes.
Life expectancy by race in the US in 2001 ranged from 86.7
for Asian females to 68.7 for black males, a gap of 18 y.
Analysis of life expectancy by county of residence and by the
combination of race and county of residence (referred to as
``race-county'' in this paper) demonstrates even larger
disparities [23]. County-level analysis of mortality for 1997­
2001 (pooled over 5 y to increase sample size) demonstrates a
22.5-y gap in life expectancy between males in southwest
South Dakota and females in Stearns County, Minnesota (see
Dataset S1 for life expectancy by county). When race-county
combinations are considered, life expectancy disparities are
dramatically larger. For example, Native American males in
the cluster of Bennet, Jackson, Mellette, Shannon, Todd, and
Washabaugh Counties in South Dakota had a life expectancy
of 58 y in 1997­2001, compared to Asian females in Bergen
County, New Jersey, with a life expectancy of 91 y, a gap of 33
y (see also Figure 1). Mortality inequalities in subgroups
within race-counties, such as those defined based on socio-
economic status (SES), may be even larger. Because of small
sample size and the absence of individual-level linked data
needed to study race-county-SES combinations, it is currently
not possible to study mortality patterns within race groups in
small geographic areas, or even states. The largest measurable
gaps observed in the US to-date are those revealed by
examining the inequalities across race-county groups.
Formulating effective policies and programs to ameliorate
health inequalities requires an understanding of the interre-
lated causes of mortality disparities, specific interventions to
mitigate these causes, and intervention delivery mechanisms
[24,25]. Efforts to characterize the contributions of specific
diseases and injuries, risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol, or
obesity, access to effective health care, and the broader
socioeconomic determinants of health and disease are
severely hampered by data limitations: the analysis of
mortality by age and disease for specific race-counties is
affected by the small numbers of deaths, such that even
pooling data for 10 y or more does not provide sufficient
person-years of observation to draw stable and robust
conclusions for some diseases, especially by age. Data on risk
factor exposure and health-care access and utilization are
even more limited, as there are almost no sources of
information on these variables by race and county.
In order to investigate the causes of the observed race-
county mortality disparities, within the limitations posed by
sample size, we have divided US race-counties into eight
subgroups based on a number of sociodemographic and
geographical variables, referred to as the ``eight Americas''. In
addition to examining the role of specific diseases in age-
specific and all-age mortality disparities, the eight Americas
analysis identifies distinct subgroups, based on a small number
of sociodemographic and geographical indicators, towards
whom public health and medical interventions may be
targeted. We emphasize that the grouping of US race-counties
into the eight Americas in our analysis is not the only division
that could be used for understanding the large mortality
inequalities across racecounties. This grouping however
reveals important variations in total as well as age-, sex-, and
disease-specific mortality that call for further investigation of
causes and potential interventions.
Methods
Definition of the Eight Americas
We estimated life expectancy for eight subgroups of the US
population, which we refer to as the ``eight Americas.'' The
building blocks for the eight Americas were a combination of
race and county of residence. The race-county units were
combined based on a number of socioeconomic and geo-
graphical indicators, including the location of the county of
residence, population density, race-specific county-level per
capita income, and cumulative homicide rate (Table 1; Figure 2).
We arranged the 3,141 US counties into 2,072 individual or
merged county units. There were two reasons for forming
merged county units. (1) To avoid very small county
populations and numbers of deaths, smaller counties were
merged with adjacent counties to form units with total
population of at least 10,000 males and 10,000 females. (2)
Merged county units were also formed where necessary to
account for changes in county status and county lines, such as
formations of new counties and incorporation of independent
cities (which are officially equivalent to counties) into
surrounding counties. The result was a consistent set of
2,072 individual or merged county units that represent the
same physical land areas from 1980 through the present. We
then divided the entire US population (the race-county units)
into eight distinct subgroups, the eight Americas, based on the
location of the county of residence, population density, per
capita income of the county of residence in 1990, and
cumulative homicide rate (averaged between 1991 and 2001
to reduce sensitivity to outlier years) (Table 1; Figure 2). We
used a population density of greater than 100 persons/km2 to
distinguish urban from rural areas. Low-income race-county
combinations were defined as those below the national median
of race-specific county-level per capita income. Cumulative
homicide rate was used as an indicator of deterioration of
social institutions and neighborhood cohesion. These factors
have been found to adversely affect health outcomes above
and beyond individual characteristics [26,27]. High-risk urban
areas were defined as those where the cumulative probability
of homicide death between the ages of 15 and 74 exceeded the
95th percentile of all US counties, or 1.1%.
Data Sources for Population, Mortality, and
Sociodemographic Indicators
Bureau of the Census population estimates and National
Center for Health Statistics bridged-race population esti-
mates. For 1982­1989, we interpolated age-, sex-, race-, and

county-specific population figures using the 1980 and 1990
censual figures, assuming a constant growth rate. For 1990­
2001, we used the bridged-race population estimates, released
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), to be
consistent with race categories used in mortality registration
[28]. Race was defined according to the 1977 US Office of
Management and Budget definition of the four race groups
(Asians, blacks, Native Americans, and whites), which has
been preserved in the bridged and censual population
estimates. Race-specific county income was from the 1990
census [29].
NCHS mortality statistics. All deaths occurring in the US
are reported to the NCHS, with causes of deaths coded to
follow the International Classification of Disease system.
NCHS data also include county of residence (matched to the
US census), race, sex, and age. Public-use mortality files,
available through the NCHS [30] or the National Bureau of
Economic Research, do not provide county identifiers for
deaths in counties with fewer than 100,000 people. We
obtained county identifiers for all deaths for years 1982
through 2001 through a special request to the NCHS. County
identifiers for years after 2002 were not provided to us
because of changes in NCHS policy. NCHS race categories
were collapsed into the four Office of Management and
Budget categories. A very small proportion (,0.001%) of all
deaths were classified as ``other race.'' We assumed these
deaths to be among Asians, the group with the best mortality
experience, in order not to overestimate disparities.
Despite the fact that we used the NCHS bridged-race
population estimates, which are estimated for consistency of
race definitions with those in death certificates and mortality
statistics, there may be differential under- or overestimation
of race-specific population and mortality. This can occur
because race is recorded by individuals or their families in the

census (population) and by the certifying physician or funeral
facility on the death certificate (mortality). This differential
recording system is a potential source of bias in life
expectancy, especially for the smaller race groups: Native
Americans and Asians [1,31]. The bias for Native Americans
observed in national data is unlikely to affect our estimates
because the grouping used in the eight Americas distin-
guishes those Native Americans who primarily live on or near
reservations (America 5), and are hence less likely to be
undercounted, from the remaining Native Americans, who
are included in America 3. For Asians, this source of bias was
addressed by adjusting population and mortality for differ-
ential underestimation using the National Mortality Follow-
back Survey [1,31]. Following Hahn and Eberhardt [1], age-
and sex-specific correction factors were applied to popula-
tion and mortality figures for Asians (America 1), with the
excess mortality or population coming from Middle America
(America 3), the group to which Asians are most likely to be
misclassified.
Data Sources on Health Plan Coverage and Health-Care
Utilization
Data on health plan coverage and health-care utilization
were from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). The BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional telephone
survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and state health departments. The BRFSS uses a
multistage cluster design based on random-digit dialing to
select a representative sample from each state's noninstitu-
tionalized civilian residents aged 18 y and older, and is
described in detail elsewhere [32,33] and in online documen-
tation (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss). The BRFSS questionnaire
primarily focuses on personal risk behaviors and exposures,
but also includes questions on health plan coverage and
utilization of care. The BRFSS data for 2001­2003 were
averaged to reduce sensitivity to interannual fluctuations.
Counties were matched to the appropriate America using the
standardized Federal Information Processing Standards
(FIPS) county codes. Counties with unidentifiable codes
(,1% of all counties) were excluded from the analysis. The
BRFSS survey instrument on health-care access asks about
health-care coverage status including health insurance,
prepaid plans such as HMOs, and government programs
such as Medicare or Medicaid. The BRFSS also asks about
time since the last routine checkup. BRFSS data from the
latest 2­3 y before the analysis were used: 2001­2003 for
health-care coverage and 2001­2002 for checkup (this
variable was not included in the 2003 BRFSS).
Data for International Comparisons
Data on life expectancy and probabilities of death (all-
cause and disease-specific) for international comparisons
were from the Global Burden of Disease databases, main-
tained by the World Health Organization [34,35].
Analysis Methods
Period all-cause and cause-eliminated life expectancies and
probabilities of death were calculated using standard demo-
graphic life-table techniques [36].

the national average. America 2 consists of northland
(Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa, Montana, and Nebraska)
low-income rural white populations, with income and
education below the national average. America 3 is Middle
America, the large fraction of the US population that has
slightly above-average per capita income and education. This
group largely consists of white Americans (98% of America
3), but also includes small numbers of Asians and Native
Americans living in counties that are not included in
Americas 1 and 5. America 4 consists of low-income white
populations in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, 30% of
whom have not completed high school. America 5 is made up
of Native Americans living in the West, excluding the West
Coast. The majority of this group lives on or near
reservations, mostly in the Four Corners region (where the
borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet)
or the Dakotas. America 7 comprises low-income rural blacks
in the Mississippi Valley and the Deep South. America 8
includes blacks living in high-risk urban environments.
America 6 represents the rest of black America, living mostly
in urban or semi-urban counties.

populations (America 2; 5.9 y higher life expectancy for males
and 5.6 y for females in 2001; 5.5 and 7.3 y, respectively, in
1982) and Middle America (America 3; 6.8 y higher life
expectancy for males and 7.1 y for females in 2001; 6.8 and 9.3
y, respectively, in 1982). Therefore, although many second-
generation (US-born) Asians have entered the adult cohorts,
the sustained gap between America 1 and other groups has
not narrowed over the last 20 y (see also Singh and Miller [4]).
The gap between the life expectancy of the 3.4 million
black males in high-risk urban areas in America 8 and the life
expectancy for the 5.5 million Asian females in America 1 in
2001 was 20.7 y. Within the sexes, the gap between the best-
off and the worst-off groups was 15.4 y for males (Asians
versus blacks in high-risk urban areas) and 12.8 y for females
(Asians versus low-income southern rural blacks). These gaps
are 2.4 and 2.8 times those between white and black life
expectancies for the nation as a whole for males and females,
respectively. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the gap
between Americas 1 and 8 for males widened significantly,
mostly because of higher HIV and homicide death rates.
Excluding this period, the gap in male life expectancy
between Americas 1 and 8 increased by half a year between
1982 and 2001. Excluding the first few years of the 1980s,
when there was an unexplained decline in life expectancy of
Asian females, the gap in female life expectancy between
Americas 1 and 8 declined by 2.5 y; the gap in life expectancy
between Asian females and low-income southern rural black
females (America 7) decreased by 1 y (from 13.8 to 12.8 y).
The 12.8-y gap in life expectancy between females in
Americas 1 and 7 is approximately the same as the gap
between Japan, with the highest national life expectancy for
females in 2001 (84.7 y), and Fiji, Nicaragua, and Lebanon
[34]. Asian females in the US have a life expectancy that is 3 y
higher than that of females in Japan [34]. For males, the 15.4-y
gap in life expectancy between Asians (America 1) and high-
risk urban blacks (America 8) is the same as between Iceland,
with the highest national male life expectancy in 2001 (78.2 y),
and Sao Tome, Belarus, and Uzbekistan [34]. In other words,
millions of Americans, distinctly identified by their socio-
demographic characteristics and place of residence, have life
expectancies that are similar to some low-income developing
countries (see also Figure 4B).
The eight Americas classification reveals that within the
white population there is a wide variation in health
experience that cannot be explained by differences in average
income: low-income white rural populations in Minnesota, the
Dakotas, Iowa, Montana, and Nebraska (America 2), with a life
expectancy of 76.2 and 81.8 y for males and females,
respectively, have a substantial advantage over the rest of
white America, despite a large income disadvantage. Low-
income whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley
(America 4), with an average income level similar to that of
America 2, have a life expectancy equal to those of Mexico and
Panama. The life expectancy gap between whites in America 2
and America 4 was 4.2 and 3.8 y in 2001 for males and females,
respectively, comparable to the 6.4- and 4.6-y gaps between
whites and blacks as a whole. The gap between whites in
America 2 and America 4 has in fact increased since 1982,
when it was 3.0 and 2.4 y for males and females respectively;
between 1982 and 2001 life expectancy among females in
America 4 declined from 78.2 y to 78.1 y.
Because America 3 is the largest subgroup of the US
population, we investigated the potential role of sociodemo-
graphic and geographical predictors used to define the eight
Americas in morality patterns within America 3. County-level
analysis of mortality for 1997­2001 shows that average life
expectancy for whites in America 3 (98% of America 3 are
whites) was 77.1 y, with a standard deviation of 1.7 y. The
correlation coefficient between county-level life expectancy
and per capita income in 2000 was 0.35. Life expectancy
ranged from 76.7 to 78.3 y in the quartiles of county-level per
capita income; it ranged from 77.0 to 78.6 y in quartiles of
county-level education (based on proportion who have
completed high school). The highest county-level education
quartile consistently had the highest life expectancy over
time, but there was no consistent education gradient for the
other three quartiles. There was also no obvious geographical
pattern in mortality in America 3 (Figure 1). For example, life
expectancy for counties east and west of the Mississippi River
was 76.6 and 77.2 y, respectively.
Although at the national level Native Americans seemingly
had a life expectancy equal to or higher than whites, Native
Americans living in the West, mostly on or near reservations
(America 5) and with the lowest per capita income of all the
eight Americas had a major mortality disadvantage. Life
expectancies for America 5 were 5.9 and 4.3 y lower than
Middle America (America 3) for males and females, respec-
tively, in 2001. Cause-of-death analysis for America 5
demonstrates that this Native American population has very
high rates of mortality from alcohol-related causes such as
road traffic accidents and cirrhosis of the liver, as well as
diabetes (Figure 4A). Across the three black Americas (black
Middle America, southern low-income rural, and high-risk
urban), the gap in life expectancy in 2001 was 1 y for females
and nearly 3 y for males. The male gap was as wide as 4 y in
the mid-1990s, with the subsequent decline mostly due to
reduction in HIV/AIDS mortality.
Age and Disease Patterns of Mortality in the Eight
Americas
Figure 4 shows mortality risk in four age groups (0­4, 15­
44, 45­64, and 65­74 y) for the eight Americas, and further
compares Americas 1 and 8 with countries and regions at a
range of mortality levels including Japan, the United King-
dom, the Russian Federation, and the high-mortality coun-
tries of sub-Saharan Africa. Although an important gradient
in child mortality remains between America 1 and America 8,
a disadvantaged child in the US has an order of magnitude
lower risk of death compared to low-income nations in sub-
Saharan Africa. Above 70 y of age, disparities in mortality in

Mortality Disparities in the US
the eight Americas are also reduced, especially in interna-
tional comparisons. This pattern is partly because of the
generally higher mortality in this age group and possibly also
because of cohort effects.
The mortality disparities in the eight Americas are largest
for young (ages 15­44) and middle-aged adults (ages 45­64).
In these age groups, blacks living in high-risk urban areas
(America 8) have mortality risks more similar to ones in the
Russian Federation and sub-Saharan Africa, which are
substantially higher than those in America 1, Japan, or the
United Kingdom. In 2001, 15-y-old black men and women in
high-risk urban areas (America 8) were, respectively, 3.8 and
3.4 times as likely as those in America 1 to die before the age
of 60 (Figure 5A), and 4.7 and 3.8 times more likely before the
age of 45. The disparity in young and middle-aged adult
mortality between America 8 and America 1 has increased
since 1982, when the mortality risk ratio was 3.4 and 2.8 for
men and women, respectively. The excess young and middle-
aged mortality persists after removing the effects of HIV and
homicide (Figure 5B). Rather, the major mortality gradients
in these age groups are observed for injuries, cardiovascular
diseases, and other noncommunicable causes such as liver
cirrhosis and diabetes (Figure 4A). Injuries are especially
important for the observed mortality gradients between the
ages of 15 and 44.

males and females, the rates of routine checkup are slightly

disadvantage.
Discussion
The eight Americas in this paper consist of distinct
subgroups of the US population defined based on a small
number of sociodemographic and geographical indicators
including race, the location of the county of residence,
population density, race-specific county-level per capita
income, and cumulative homicide rate. Put in a global
context, the disparities in mortality experiences among the
eight Americas, each consisting of millions or tens of millions
of Americans, are enormous. The eight Americas analysis
indicates that ten million Americans with the best health have
achieved one of the highest levels of life expectancy on
record, 3 y better than Japan for females and 4 y better than
Iceland for males. At the same time, tens of millions of
Americans are experiencing levels of health that are more
typical of middle-income or low-income developing coun-
tries. These poor levels of health occur in areas throughout
the country. The health disparities among the eight Americas
cannot be explained by single causes of death such as
homicide or HIV. Nor are the largest sources of disparity in
children and the elderly. The mortality disparities are most
concentrated in young and middle-aged males and females,
and are a result of a number of chronic diseases and injuries
with well-established risk factors.
Trends in life expectancy show that neither the relative
ordering nor the absolute levels of life expectancy disparities
among the eight Americas decreased between 1982 and 2001.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the life expectancy gap
between America 8 and the remaining groups widened
significantly for males, mostly because of HIV and homicide
rates. In this overall picture of stable disparities, there have
been specific groups whose mortality has worsened. For
example, the life expectancy of low-income white females in
Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley declined between 1982
and 2001.
The most important limitation of the data used for our
analysis is that reported race in the census, used for
population estimates, may be different from race in mortality
statistics, where race may be reported by the family, the
certifying physician, or the funeral director [1,31]. Sensitivity
to differential race reporting would be largest for those
groups with small population and a relatively large propor-
tion of mixed-race individuals, mainly the Native Americans
and Asians [1,31]. In these groups, it is more likely for race to
be reported as Native American or Asian in the census than it
is in the death certificate; hence, the differential under-
estimation of deaths and population results in bias in the
form of a net underestimation of mortality [1,31]. The
mortality and population for Asians were corrected for
differential underestimation, using the National Mortality
Followback Survey [1,31] (Correction using the National
Longitudinal Mortality Study would have given virtually
identical estimates: 12% underreporting of mortality in the
National Mortality Followback Survey versus 13% in the
National Longitudinal Mortality Study [31]). For Native
Americans, misreporting race on death certificates is most
important where mixed races exist and Native Americans
form a small proportion of the population (e.g., in Califor-
nia). The grouping used in the eight Americas distinguished
between those Native Americans who primarily live on or
near reservations (America 5) and the remaining Native
Americans (included in America 3), and is therefore robust to
this error because living on or near reservations increases the
likelihood of correct race recording on death certificates. Any
residual bias would be in the form of net underestimation of
mortality as described above and as observed nationally for
Native Americans [31]. Mortality underestimation would in
turn imply that life expectancy is even lower in America 5, and
hence further magnify the findings of the above analysis on
mortality disadvantage in America 5.
A secondary source of bias for Asians may be back-
migration of first-generation immigrants, who return to their
home countries due to illness. This would lead to an
underreporting of deaths for Asians, and overestimation of
life expectancy in America 1. To examine the effect of this
source of bias, we repeated the analysis restricting the sample
to US-born Asians. Excluding the two states (Alaska and
Hawaii) whose Asian population is entirely in America 3 (and
not in America 1), US-born Asian females and males had life
expectancies at birth that were, respectively, 5.1 and 1.6 y
higher than those for combined US-born and foreign-born
Asians together, consistent with previous findings on immi-
grant populations [4]. Lower mortality in US-born Asians
confirms that the patterns in Figures 3­5 are not a result of
unrecorded mortality due to return migration among Asian

populations; rather, they represent a real mortality advantage
in America 1.
The findings on persistent health disparities in the eight
Americas raise the question of why, as a society, we have
failed to narrow health gaps between distinct and large
subgroups of the US population. Opportunities and inter-
ventions to reduce health inequalities include (1) reducing
socioeconomic inequalities, which are the distal causes of
health inequalities, (2) increasing financial access to health
care by decreasing the number of Americans without health
plan coverage, (3) removing physical, behavioral, and cultural
barriers to health care, (4) reducing disparities in the quality
of care, (5) designing public health strategies and interven-
tions to reduce health risks at the level of communities (e.g.,
changes in urban/neighborhood design to facilitate physical
activity and reduce obesity), and (6) designing public health
strategies to reduce health risks that target individuals or
population subgroups that are not necessarily in the same
community (e.g., tobacco taxation or pharmacological inter-
ventions for blood pressure and cholesterol).
Important research in the past few decades has illustrated
the critical role of individual and community-level socio-
economic factors, be it in absolute or relative terms, in health
outcomes [11,24,37,38]. In addition to (or in the absence of, as
is currently the case in the US) systematic policies for
reducing socioeconomic inequalities, public health and
health care provide instruments for addressing inequalities
in health outcomes. Much of the health policy agenda in the
US is currently focused on health insurance coverage for the
nearly 44 million Americans (15% of the population) who
lack health insurance [39,40]. Although increasing insurance
coverage and access to care would most likely contribute to
narrowing disparities across the eight Americas, the available
data (Figure 6) suggest that the variation in health plan
coverage across the eight Americas is small relative to the
very large gradient in health outcomes. It is likely that
expanding insurance coverage alone would still leave huge
disparities in young and middle-aged adults. A shortcoming
of the BRFSS data on health insurance and health-care
utilization, however, is that they do not provide any insight
into the likely contribution of variation in quality of care to
the disparities across the eight Americas.
The diseases with the largest contribution to mortality
disparities across the eight Americas are chronic diseases and
injuries with well-established risk factors, including alcohol
use, tobacco smoking, overweight and obesity, and elevated
blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. These risk factors
are also the leading cause of burden of disease in the nation
as a whole (Figure 7). An important question, therefore, is the
distributions of exposure to these risks in the eight Americas,
and the fraction of disease-specific and all-cause mortality
attributable to their hazardous effects. This is particularly
relevant for combinations of risk factors that together
account for large proportions of many chronic diseases
[41,42]. Definite estimates of the contributions of risk factors
to health inequalities require analyses for race-county
combinations, which are not readily possible using currently
available data: among data sources on risk factors, the BRFSS
allows subnational analysis but relies on self-reported
exposure. Although self-reported exposure is the common
metric for risks such as tobacco smoking and alcohol use, it is
subject to bias for overweight and obesity and for elevated
blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose because of individual
reporting behavior and because individuals may not be aware
of their blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose status. The
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provides
measurements of this latter group of risks, but does not
include sufficient geographical detail for analysis at the
county or even state level [25]. Methods for combining the
two data sources to obtain estimates for population sub-
groups based on race and place of residence are required [43].
If analysis of risk factors illustrates that a substantial
proportion of disparities among the eight Americas are
attributable to risk factor exposure, risk factor interventions
should be investigated as tools for reducing health inequal-
ities, in the same way that they have been used for achieving
aggregate national health benefits. The interventions will
likely include both population-wide measures (e.g., tobacco
taxation, drinking-and-driving countermeasures, and inter-
ventions to reduce public and domestic alcohol-induced
violence) and personal interventions (e.g., pharmacological
interventions for blood pressure and cholesterol).
The traditional emphasis of the US health system has been
on children and the elderly, as, for example, illustrated by the
low levels of resources devoted to injury prevention and
tobacco control compared with immunization [44]. This
emphasis may have partly contributed to substantially lower
disparities in these age groups relative to young and middle-
aged adults. On the other hand, the emphasis on children and
the elderly has treated many of the diseases that are
important contributors to young and middle-aged adult
health disparities, and their risk factors, as either the
responsibilities of individuals (alcohol, tobacco, obesity, and
dietary determinants of blood pressure and cholesterol, like
salt) or in the domain of clinical care (blood pressure and
cholesterol). A number of important steps are needed to
broaden the current perspective. First, there is a need to use
systematic epidemiological and economic analyses to identify
effective and cost-effective health interventions--whether
targeting populations or individuals--that would make the

biggest difference to those with the worst health. Given the
distinct epidemiological, geographical, and sociodemo-
graphic profiles of the eight Americas, the leading inter-
ventions may be different for each, although some common
core strategies may exist (e.g., common core cardiovascular
disease prevention strategies). Second, monitoring systems
should be developed by the states and territories to provide
local but benchmarked information on the fraction of the
population in each community who would benefit from these
interventions and are receiving them. Third, information on
the delivery of these interventions for different communities
should be publicly reported. It is when the public, community
and professional groups, media, and politicians focus
attention on what is being achieved, and why efforts are
working in some places and not others, that the culture of
accountability for health outcomes will be strengthened.

Editors' Summary
Background. It has been recognized for a long time that the number of
years that people in the United States can expect to live (``life
expectancy'') varies enormously. For example, white Americans tend to
live longer than black Americans, and life expectancy is much greater in
some of the roughly 3,000 counties of the US than it is in others.
However, there is a lack of information and understanding on how big a
part is played in ``health inequalities'' by specific diseases and injuries, by
risk factors (such as tobacco, alcohol, and obesity), and by variations in
access to effective health care.
Why Was This Study Done? The researchers wanted to find a way of
dividing the people of the US into groups based on a small number of
characteristics--such as location of county of residence, race, and
income--that would help demonstrate the most important factors
accounting for differences in life expectancy.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers used figures
from the US Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics
to calculate mortality (death) rates for the years 1982­2001. They took
note of the county of residence and of the race of all the people who
died during that period of time. This enabled them to calculate the
mortality rates for all 8,221 ``race-county units'' (all of the individuals of a
given race in a given county). They experimented with different ways of
combining the race-counties into a small and manageable number of
groups. They eventually settled on the idea of there being ``eight
Americas,'' defined on the basis of race-county, population density,
income, and homicide rate. Each group contains millions or tens of
millions of people. For each of the eight groups the researchers
estimated life expectancy, the risk of mortality from specific diseases, the
proportion of people who had health insurance, and people's routine
encounters with health-care services. (The researchers also created maps
of life expectancies for the US counties.) They describe their eight
Americas as follows: Asians, northland low-income rural whites, Middle
America, low-income whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley,
western Native Americans, black Middle America, low-income southern
rural blacks, and high-risk urban blacks.
Many striking differences in life expectancy were found between the
eight groups. For example, in 2001, the life expectancy gap between the
3.4 million high-risk urban black males and the 5.6 million Asian females
was nearly 21 years. Within the sexes, the life expectancy gap between
the best-off and the worst-off groups was 15.4 years for males (Asians
versus high-risk urban blacks) and 12.8 years for females (Asians versus
low-income rural blacks in the South). The causes of death that were
mainly responsible for these variations were various chronic diseases and
injury. The gaps between best-off and worst-off were similar in 2001 to
what they were in 1987.
What Do These Findings Mean? Health inequalities in the US are large
and are showing no sign of reducing. Social and economic reforms
would certainly help change the situation. At the same time, the public
health system should also improve the way in which it deals with risk
factors for chronic diseases and injuries so that groups with the highest
death rates receive larger benefits.
