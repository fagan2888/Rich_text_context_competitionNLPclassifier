C-REACTIVE protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein
produced primarily by hepatocytes in response to
proinflammatory cytokines, and the recent application of
highly sensitive CRP assays has led to the discovery that
relatively minor elevations of CRP--indicating chronic
low-grade inflammation--are predictive of a wide range of
diseases associated with aging, including cardiovascular
disease (Danesh & Pepys, 2000; Ridker, Hennekens,
Buring, & Rifai, 2000; Ridker, Rifai, Rose, Buring, & Cook,
2002), type 2 diabetes (Pradhan, Manson, Rifai, Buring, &
Ridker, 2001; Thorand et al., 2003), dementia (Engelhart
et al., 2004), and late-life disability (Kuo, Bean, Yen, &
Leveille, 2006). Elevated CRP has also been prospectively
associated with increased mortality risk in a healthy elderly
population (Jenny et al., 2007). Although the causal pro-
cesses linking chronic inflammation to disease and mortal-
ity are not fully elucidated, CRP has emerged as an important
marker of disease risk in epidemiological research and in
clinical research and practice (Pearson et al., 2003).
Dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES) are widely
recognized among social scientists as "fundamental causes"
of disease that operate through more proximate contextual,
behavioral, and psychosocial pathways to shape individual
health as well as disparities in population health (Link &
Phelan, 1995). From this perspective, exposure to tradi-
tional "risk factors" for disease like smoking, or a poor qual-
ity diet, is probabilistically linked to social and environmental
conditions beyond the individual. Socioeconomic disparities
represent "risk regulators" that lead to health disparities by
shaping the distributions of risk factors for disease across
time and space (Glass & McAtee, 2006). In the context of
aging, research on cumulative inequality and cumulative
advantage or disadvantage has provided a theoretical frame-
work for studying the dynamic relationships among social
and biological factors as they shape trajectories of health
across the life course (Dannefer, 2003; Ferraro & Shippee,
2009; Hatch, 2005). These conceptual tools, as well as recent
incorporation of minimally invasive biological measures into
population-based social science surveys (Lindau & McDade,
2008; McDade, Williams, & Snodgrass, 2007), are providing
new opportunities for more comprehensive integrative ap-
proaches to health research that draw on the complementary
strengths of the social and biomedical sciences.
We attempt to contribute to this effort by investigating
the determinants of CRP in a nationally representative
population-based survey of aging and health. The objec-
tives of our analyses are threefold: (a) to investigate edu-
cational status, house
hold assets, and race/ethnicity as
predictors of CRP among older adults in the United States;
(b) to consider interactions between age and measures of

Objective. Inflammation plays an important role in many chronic degenerative diseases associated with aging, and
social, economic, and behavioral factors that contribute to inflammation may lead to differential burdens of morbidity and
mortality in later life. This study examines socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity as predictors of C-reactive protein
(CRP) among older adults in the United States and considers the degree to which health behaviors, medical conditions
and medication use, and psychosocial factors account for these associations.
Methods. Multiple linear regression analysis of survey data for 1,580 participants, 57­85 years of age, in a population-
based nationally representative sample of community-residing older adults in the United States.
Results. Educational attainment, household wealth, and race/ethnicity were independently associated with CRP, with
limited evidence for interactions with age. Health-related behaviors and usage of medications related to inflammation
accounted for substantial proportions of these associations.
Discussion. These results highlight the fundamental causes of inflammation among older adults and suggest pathways
through which social disparities in inflammation may be reduced.

social stratification; and (c) to evaluate the extent to which
health behaviors, medical conditions and medication use,
and psychosocial factors account for social disparities in
CRP concentration in later life.
We focus on education and household wealth as measures of
SES based on prior work demonstrating their relevance to tra-
jectories of aging and health (Robert & House, 1996; Shuey &
Willson, 2008), and we investigate race/ethnicity as a distinct
(but likely correlated) dimension of social stratification with
dramatic implications for health in our society, particularly
among African Americans (Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, &
Bound, 2006; Hayward, Miles, Crimmins, &Yang, 2000). We
evaluate interactions between age and these three measures of
social stratification to explore whether social gradients in CRP
strengthen with age, as suggested by "cumulative adversity"
and "weathering" approaches, or whether they weaken, as sug-
gested by "age-as-leveler" approaches to understanding the
relationships among social adversity, aging, and health (Dupre,
2007). We then consider a set of more proximate factors that
link social stratification and CRP in an effort to illuminate the
pathways that may contribute to health disparities later in life.
Methods
Participants and Data Collection
Analyses are based on data from the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP; Lindau et al., 2007).
Briefly, a national probability sample of community-residing
adults 57­85 years of age was selected to study biological
and physical function pathways through which social status
and relationships influence later life health. Of 4,017 eligible
persons, 3,005 (1,550 women and 1,455 men) participated.
In-home interviews were conducted between July 2005 and
March 2006, and a random five-sixths of respondents (N =
2,494) were asked to provide a blood sample using a mini-
mally invasive fingerstick method (McDade et al., 2007).
The refusal rate was 16% (N = 389), and an additional 2%
(N = 57) had equipment problems or were otherwise unable
to provide a sample (Williams & McDade, 2009). Of the
2,048 providing a blood sample, 2,032 were received by the
lab and available for analysis. The protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Chicago
and National Opinion Research Center; all respondents pro-
vided written informed consent.
Variables
Measures of SES and race/ethnicity.--Age at the time of
interview was calculated based on the date of birth provided
by the respondent. Race/ethnicity was based on participant
self-report, and for these analyses, participants were assigned
to one of four categories: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, or other (small numbers of individuals from
several groups precluded a finer level of analysis).
Educational attainment was defined by five categories:
less than high school, high school graduate/general education
diploma, some college/associates degree/vocational certifi-
cate, undergraduate degree, and post undergraduate school.
Household assets (net worth) were defined as ownership of
property (e.g., home, rental property, car, businesses) and
financial assets (e.g., savings accounts, stocks, bonds, pen-
sions) after accounting for loans. Individuals were asked to
provide an approximate dollar amount. For "don't know"
and "refused" responses, individuals were offered a series
of bracketing questions to identify the range of assets.
Health behaviors.--We assessed waist circumference as
a summary measure of energy balance resulting from ha-
bitual patterns of physical activity and diet. Waist circum-
ference was measured during the interview using a tape
measure placed at the respondent's natural waist, midway
between navel and bottom of ribcage. The distribution of
normal waist circumference is higher in men than in wom-
en, and internally derived sex-specific waist circumference
z-scores were used in the analysis (McCarthy Jarrett, Em-
mett, Rogers, & Team, 2005; Ostberg et al., 2005).
Frequency of physical activity was rated on a 5-point
scale (0 = never to 4 = 3 or more times per week) in re-
sponse to the question "How often do you participate in
physical activity such as walking, dancing, gardening,
physical exercise or sports?" Sleep quality was measured by
self-reported frequency of feeling rested in the morning
(4-point scale, 0 = never to 3 = most of the time). Cigarette
smoking status (never, former, or current) was based on
self-report. Participants were also queried on whether they
ever drink any alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, or
liquor. In addition, we considered a measure of the cleanliness
of the participant's home based on interviewer assessment.
At the end of the interview, the interviewer completed a
debriefing questionnaire, which included the following
item: "Describe the room(s) in which the interview was
conducted." Options ranged from clean = 1 to dirty = 5.
We included this variable because prior research has
shown this question to be associated with health outcomes,
including CRP (Dunifon, Duncan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2001;
McDade, 
Rutherford, Adair, & Kuzawa, 2008).
Medical factors.--Current medical conditions were as-
sessed by asking participants "has a medical doctor ever
told you that you have any of the following conditions?"
diabetes or high blood sugar; Alzheimer's disease or anoth-
er form of dementia; arthritis; emphysema, chronic bronchi-
tis or chronic obstructive lung disease; asthma; stroke,
cerebrovascular accident, blood clot or bleeding in the brain,
transient ischemic attack, heart failure, or heart attack. In-
terviewers directly observed participants' medications by
asking to see all medications used "on a regular schedule,
like every day or every week." Our analysis considers com-
monly used prescription and over-the-counter medications

with established effects on inflammation, categorized ac-
cording to mechanism of action using Multum Drug Data-
base: Lexicon Plus version (Qato et al., 2008), as follows:
statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), immunosuppres-
sive agents (antipsoriatics, antihistamines, leukotriene modi-
fiers, and mast cell stabilizers), glucocorticoids (steroidal
anti-inflammatories and inhaled corticosteroids), sex hor-
mones (estrogens, progestin, and sex hormone combina-
tions),nonsteroidalanti-inflammatories(analgesics,analgesic
combinations, cox-2 inhibitors, miscellaneous analgesics,
narcotic analgesic combinations, and antirheumatics), and
coagulation modifiers (salicylates, 5-aminosalicylates, and
antiplatelet agents).
Psychosocial factors.--An 11-item short version of the
Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale was
used as a measure of depression (Kohout, Berkman, Evans,
& Cornoni-Huntley, 1993). A modified version of the sev-
en-item anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and De-
pression Scale was used to assess anxiety levels (Snaith,
2002). Perceived stress was assessed using a modified
version of the four-item Perceived Stress Scale (Pbert,
Doerfler, & DeCosimo 1992). Marital status was based on
the response to the following question: "Are you currently
married, living with a partner, separated, divorced, wid-
owed, or have you never been married?" We recognize that
marital status is commonly considered a demographic fac-
tor, but we included it with other psychosocial factors fol-
lowing prior work evaluating relationship status and quality
as psychosocial factors that influence immune function and
inflammation in experimental settings (Kiecolt-Glaser
et al., 2005; Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003)
Measurement of CRP.--Details on the collection of dried
blood spot samples and the analysis of CRP have been pre-
sented elsewhere (Williams & McDade, 2009). Briefly, free
flowing capillary blood was collected on filter paper com-
monly used for neonatal screening (#903; Schleicher &
Schuell, Keene, NH). Samples were analyzed in the Lab-
oratory for Human Biology Research at Northwestern
University using a high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay
protocol previously developed for use with blood spots
(McDade, Burhop, & Dohnal, 2004). Prior validation of as-
say performance indicates that the blood spot CRP method
has good sensitivity, precision, and reliability and a high
correlation between matched plasma and blood spot sam-
ples (Pearson r = .96) (McDade et al., 2004). Of the 2,032
participants with blood samples available for testing, 1,939
(95%) had usable CRP data (exclusions were primarily due
to an insufficient volume of blood).
Data Analysis
The distribution of CRP was highly skewed and was there-
fore log-transformed prior to analysis. In addition, because
we are using CRP as an indicator of chronic low-grade
inflammation that may increase risk for cardiovascular
disease, we eliminated individuals with evidence of an
acute inflammatory condition (e.g., infection). A recent
joint scientific statement issued by the American Heart As-
sociation and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion recommends that plasma CRP concentrations more
than 10 mg/L be discarded (Pearson et al., 2003). Using a
conversion formula based on prior comparison of matched
plasma/blood spot samples (McDade et al., 2004), this
plasma value corresponds to a blood spot CRP concentra-
tion of 8.6 mg/L. We therefore removed individuals with
blood spot CRP greater than 8.6 mg/L from our analyses
due to the likelihood that these high concentrations repre-
sented acute inflammation.
Analyses proceeded in four stages using a series of linear
regression models with log-transformed CRP concentration
as the dependent variable. We first investigated the bivariate
relationships between CRP concentration and health behav-
iors, medical, and psychosocial factors. A p value <.05 was
set as the criterion for statistical significance. Second, we
considered models evaluating gender, race/ethnicity, and
age as predictors of CRP (Model 1). We isolated these vari-
ables to evaluate whether associations were modified by the
inclusion of education and assets. Third, we considered a
model that included education, assets, race/ethnicity, gen-
der, and age to document the extent to which disparities in
CRP exist along these dimensions (Model 2). We also tested
for interactions between age and education, age and assets,
as well as age and race/ethnicity. We considered separate
models stratified by age group (57­64, 65­74, and 75­85
years) to aid interpretation if the interaction terms reached
statistical significance. Fourth, we examined health behav-
iors, medical, and psychosocial factors (found in the first
stage) in a final model including education, assets, race/eth-
nicity, gender, and age. We investigated whether these prox-
imate factors accounted for social disparities in CRP by
evaluating the degree to which they modified regression co-
efficients for education, assets, and race/ethnicity in com-
parison to the base model. Analyses accounted for the
sampling strata and clustering, and weights were employed
to adjust for differential probabilities of selection and dif-
ferential nonresponse. Standard errors were calculated us-
ing the linearization method (Binder, 1983). Statistical
analyses were conducted with Stata Version 10.0 (Stata-
Corp, 2008).
Complete sociodemographic and CRP data were avail-
able for 1,701 participants. Analyses excluded 121 partici-
pants with CRP >8.6 mg/L, resulting in an analytic sample
of 1,580. The final model loses 35 observations due to miss-
ing values across different variables. The 35 participants not
included in the final model did not differ from other partici-
pants with respect to CRP (p > .9), and results were very
similar when these 35 observations were also excluded from
the models evaluated in Stages 1 through 3.

Results
The weighted response rate for the NSHAP study was
75.5% (74.8% unweighted). Distributions for the variables
considered in our analyses are presented in Table 1. The
demographic characteristics of the subset of respondents
with complete sociodemographic and CRP data closely
match those of respondents to the 2002 Current Popula-
tion Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003) as is true for the
NSHAP sample overall (Lindau et al., 2007). The median
blood spot CRP concentration was 1.5 mg/L (25th percen-
tile: 0.6 and 75th percentile: 3.5). Individuals with CRP
>8.6 mg/L excluded from subsequent analyses did not dif-
fer significantly from the rest of the sample with respect to
age. However, Blacks compared with Whites (odds ratio
[OR] = 2.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.84­4.72,
p < .01) as well as females (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.31­
2.95, p < .01) and individuals with lower levels of educa-
tional attainment (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.21­1.68, p <
.01) and higher waist circumference (OR = 1.03; 95%
CI = 1.02­1.04, p < .01) were more likely to be excluded
due to acute elevations in CRP.
CRP concentration was significantly higher in non-His-
panic Black participants compared with Whites and among
women compared with men (Table 2, Model 1). However,
these differences were substantially attenuated when educa-
tion and assets were considered (Table 2, Model 2). Higher
educational attainment was associated with reduced CRP.
Higher levels of household assets were also associated with
lower CRP, but this association was significant only for in-
dividuals with the highest levels of assets (>$500,000).
Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks
had marginally higher concentrations of CRP, and Hispan-
ics had significantly lower concentrations. There was no
significant gender difference in CRP after controlling for
other sociodemographic factors.
We found no evidence for significant interactions be-
tween age and educational status (p = .57) or household as-
sets (p = .18). However, associations between CRP and
race/ethnicity were significantly moderated by age (p <
.01). In the youngest age group, a similar pattern in CRP
across race/ethnicity was seen as reported above, with
higher CRP among non-Hispanic blacks (B = 0.105, SE =
.077) and lower CRP among Hispanics (B = -0.197,
SE = 0.069) compared with Whites. In the middle age
group, the association between race/ethnicity and CRP was
weaker (p = .07). In the oldest age group, differences in
CRP concentrations across the racial/ethnic groups were
further attenuated (p = .58).
We next investigated the extent to which associations be-
tween CRP and social status were independent of health be-
haviors, psychosocial factors, and medical factors that
bivariate analyses revealed as significant predictors of CRP in
our sample (Table 2, full model). Waist circumference and
smoking (both currently and in the past) were positively as-
sociated with CRP. The interviewer's rating of the cleanliness

of the respondent's household was also associated with CRP,
with lower CRP concentrations for respondents living in a
household evaluated as cleaner. The use of sex hormones and
immunosuppressive medications were associated with ele-
vated CRP, whereas statin use predicted lower CRP. Physical
activity levels, sleep quality, alcohol use, history of heart fail-
ure or arthritis, depressive symptoms, and being married or
cohabitating were significantly associated with CRP in bi-
variate analyses but not in the fully adjusted model. Remain-
ing behavioral, psychosocial, and medical factors were not
significantly related to CRP in bivariate analyses.
Educational status remained as a significant predictor of
CRP in the fully adjusted model, although the strength of
this association was substantially reduced. The interaction
between race/ethnicity and age was also statistically signifi-
cant in the full model (p < .01). Level of assets was not a
significant predictor of CRP after controlling for more
proximate behavioral, psychosocial, and medical factors.
Discussion
CRP is an important marker of morbidity and mortality
risk in older populations, and chronic inflammation may
play a role in contributing to social and economic gradi-
ents in a wide range of diseases. In this study, we find evi-
dence for substantial social gradients in CRP in a nationally

reflects personal traits related to organization and efficiency
and that these traits promote health directly, or indirectly
through their association with economic outcomes, as has
been shown in prior research with the Panel Study of In-
come Dynamics (Dunifon et al., 2001). Alternatively, a less
tidy home environment may contribute to chronic inflam-
mation if it is associated with exposure to pollutants or in-
creases the frequency or intensity of pathogen exposure.
Prior research has documented significant associations
among seropositivity to common infectious agents, inflam-
mation, and the development of cardiovascular disease
(Adiloglu et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2000), and recent findings
from a cohort of women in Philippines indicate that a
household-based measure of pathogen exposure is an im-
portant predictor of CRP (McDade et al., 2008).
Psychosocial stressors have direct effects on multiple as-
pects of immune function and inflammation, and prior re-
search has documented significant associations with CRP
(Ford & Erlinger, 2004; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2003; Seger-
strom & Miller, 2004). We find evidence for significant bi-
variate associations between CRP concentration and marital
status and symptoms of depression, but these associations
were not significant in the fully adjusted model. Although
these results suggest that psychosocial factors do not play
major roles in contributing to variation in CRP among older
adults, the impact of psychosocial factors may operate in part
through health behaviors. Smoking, for example, is more
likely for individuals under stress (Kouvonen, Kivimaki,

Virtanen, Pentti, & Vahtera, 2005). Our attempts to isolate
independent associations between psychosocial factors and
CRP thus represent a conservative test of their contribution
to inflammation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that

future population-based investigations into the psychosocial
determinants of inflammation should consider a wide range
of variables that may mediate associations with CRP.
CRP levels have been found to increase with age for men
and women, but findings are inconsistent (Hutchinson et al.,
2000; Khor et al., 2004). In our sample, age was negatively
associated with CRP for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites
but positively associated with CRP for Hispanics. And in
contrast to prior research using other indicators of health
(e.g., House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005), we find no evidence to
suggest that age modifies the association between CRP and
education or assets, with some evidence to suggest that age
attenuates differences in CRP associated with race/ethnic-
ity. This pattern of results provides limited evidence in sup-
port of the "age-as-leveler" hypothesis with respect to race/
ethnic differences in CRP, although the absence of a similar
pattern with education or assets cautions against overinter-
pretation. Rather, these results suggest that mortality selec-
tion or cohort effects contribute to differences across age in
our sample with respect to inflammation, and they under-
score the need for prospective data to identify individual
trajectories of aging, including how and why these trajecto-
ries differ across social groups.
representative cohort of older Americans: Educational sta-
tus, assets, and race/ethnicity are all significant predictors
of variation in CRP concentration. Education and race/eth-
nicity are significant predictors of acute (>8.6 mg/L) as
well as chronic low-grade inflammation in our study.
Health-related behaviors and medication usage represent
more proximate predictors of CRP that account for sub-
stantial portions of these associations. These results high-
light the fundamental causes of inflammation among older
adults and suggest pathways through which social dispari-
ties in inflammation may be reduced. A better understand-
ing of the determinants of population variation in CRP
may be particularly important for guiding primary and
secondary prevention efforts to reduce later life risk for
diseases with an inflammatory component.
Our results are consistent with several studies reporting
socioeconomic gradients in CRP, with higher concentra-
tions of CRP found in groups with lower levels of education
and income (Alley et al., 2006; Nazmi & Victora, 2007;
Ranjit et al., 2007). Higher concentrations of CRP have also
been consistently reported in African Americans compared
with EuropeanAmericans (McDade, Hawkley, & 
Cacioppo,
2006; Patel et al., 2006). Of note is the extent to which
asset-based and race/ethnic differences in CRP, and sub-
stantial portions of educational differences in CRP, can be
explained by behavioral and medical factors, suggesting
that differences in lifestyle associated with broader socio-
structural conditions are major contributors to social gradi-
ents in CRP. In particular, attenuation of the difference in
CRP between non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites after adjust-
ment for SES indicates that reduced opportunities for edu-
cation and wealth may represent important mechanisms
contributing to elevated CRP among non-Hispanic Blacks.
Associations with waist circumference and smoking
are consistent with prior population-based research
(
McDade et al., 2006). Waist circumference was a particularly
strong predictor of CRP, likely reflecting the importance
of visceral adipose tissue as a source of proinflammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (Lyon, Law, & Hsueh,
2003). Few prior studies finding social disparities in CRP
have accounted comprehensively for medication use, an issue
that is likely to be particularly important when conducting
research on inflammation among older adults (Qato et al.,
2008). We included several commonly used drug classes
with mechanisms of action known to affect inflammation
generally or CRP specifically. As has been previously re-
ported in younger samples, people using cholesterol-lowering
drugs, or statins, had significantly lower CRP concentra-
tions (Jenkins et al., 2003). Exogenous sex hormone and
immunosuppressive drug use have also been associated
with higher CRP (Ridker, Hennekens, Buring, Kundsin, &
Shih, 1999).
It is worth noting that household cleanliness was an inde-
pendent predictor of CRP. The significance of this associa-
tion is not clear. One possibility is that household cleanliness
PREDICTORS OF CRP IN OLDER ADULTS 135
A strength of this study is that we were able to evaluate a
comprehensive set of behavioral, medical, and psychosocial
predictors of CRP in a large sample representative of older
Americans.Yet educational disparities in CRP remain unac-
counted for by these variables, drawing attention to the
limitations associated with the cross-sectional analysis of
a single CRP measure. Conditions early in life may also
make significant contributions to social gradients in inflam-
mation: Recent research suggests that prenatal nutrition,
growth in infancy, and infectious disease exposure in

infancy and childhood have long-term implications for
the regulation of inflammation and CRP production in
adulthood (McDade, Kuzawa, Rutherford, & Adair, 2009;
Sattar et al., 2004). Nonetheless, our findings contribute to
a fuller understanding of inflammation as a physiological
mechanism through which social factors contribute to dis-
parities in health. Our focus on older adults complements
prior research and further underscores the value of biosocial
approaches to understanding the determinants of health
across the life course.
