Abstract
Background: Cannabis (marijuana) use and acceptance towards use are increasing in the US, and
state-level policies are becoming more liberal. A wealth of research has been conducted to
examine risk factors for use; however, studies rarely differentiate between different forms of
marijuana. Objective: We sought to determine prevalence of use and delineate who is at risk for
use of hashish, a more potent form of marijuana. Methods: We examined data from a nationally
representative sample of high school seniors in the Monitoring the Future study (2007­2011;
weighted n ¼ 10 597). We determined how sociodemographic factors and reasons for marijuana
use correlated with recent (12 month) hashish use. Results: Prevalence of recent hashish use was
6.5% and it was used by 18.3% of recent marijuana users. Hashish and other marijuana use
tended to share many of the same correlates; however, associations were often stronger for
hashish use. Females were consistently at low risk for use and users of other drugs were
consistently at high risk for use. Black students tended to be at low risk for hashish use. Low risk
of identifying as Hispanic or religious and high risk of higher personal income or going out
more evenings per week for fun disappeared when controlling for other drug use. Using
marijuana because the student felt he/she was ``hooked'' nearly doubled the odds for hashish
use. Conclusions: This was the first national study to examine prevalence and correlates of
hashish use. These findings can inform prevention in a time of increasing popularity of
marijuana use.

Introduction
Public support for cannabis (marijuana) legalization is
increasing in the US, alongside increases in use and
widespread changes in attitudes towards use (1­4). State-
level policy is beginning to shift, with four states plus the
District of Columbia legalizing recreational use and at least
another 20 states decriminalizing recreational use or legaliz-
ing medical use. As a variety of marijuana products become
more easily or legally accessible, it is important to examine
who is at risk for use of particular products in order to inform
prevention and harm reduction strategies. Despite a wealth of
research on marijuana, surprisingly very little epidemiologic
research has focused on hashish (``hash''), a hypercompressed
and more potent form of cannabis sativa.
Colorado and Washington were the first two states to
legalize recreational marijuana use and there is now no penalty
in these states for private possession of up to 1 oz by adults age
21 or older (5­7). In Colorado, the same regulations currently
apply to hashish. In Washington, an adult can legally possess
up to 16 oz of marijuana-infused products (commonly con-
taining hashish) in solid form (e.g. brownies), or 72 oz of
cannabis-infused products in liquid form (e.g. soda, which may
contain hash oil). Both hashish and non-hashish marijuana can
be smoked, vaporized, or cooked in food. Hashish can be used
either in its natural state or converted into a more concentrated
oil (8). However, compared to other marijuana, hashish usually
contains a higher concentration of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), which is the most potent psychoactive cannabinoid
(9­11). While a typical marijuana cigarette (``joint'') contains
only 0.5­5% THC, hashish tends to contain 2­20% with some
estimates as high as 50% (12).
Different methods of marijuana use can lead to differences
in absorption and metabolism of THC. When smoked, THC
is absorbed from the lungs into the bloodstream within

minutes (11). THC reaches its peak levels within 10 min after
smoking and rapidly declines to 5­10% of its initial levels
within an hour (11). Hashish, however, retains most of its
parent THC in a form that can be more readily absorbed,
either through ingestion or through smoke (13). When hashish
is ingested, THC absorption is slower, taking 1­3 hours to
enter the bloodstream; the result is a less intense high of
longer duration (13). A major metabolite, 11-hydroxy-THC, is
20% more potent than THC and results in higher concentra-
tions after being swallowed rather than smoked (14).
Teen marijuana use (with hashish use included in the
definition) has been researched extensively. In 2013, almost
half of high school seniors (45.5%) reported using marijuana
in their lifetime (1). Lifetime, annual and 30-day use is more
prevalent among males, Hispanics and among those who
reside in cities (15). Those who report marijuana use ­
particularly frequent marijuana use ­ are also at high risk for
using other illicit drugs (16,17). Research is needed to
determine not only whether hashish has different effects than
what we normally deem ``marijuana'' on surveys, but also to
delineate correlates of use to determine who may be at highest
risk for use. Findings from our previous research suggest that
it may not always be appropriate to collapse multiple forms of
the same drug or drug delivery system into a single category,
as is commonly done with marijuana (18­22).
Hashish is usually more potent than non-hashish mari-
juana, yet there is a remarkably limited literature on its
epidemiology and correlates of use. Here we examine whether
hashish and (non-hashish) ``marijuana'' have different socio-
demographic correlates of, and reasons for use in a large,
nationally representative sample of adolescents approaching
adulthood.
Methods
Design
Data were examined from Monitoring the Future (MTF), an
annual representative survey of high school students in
approximately 130 public and private schools throughout 48
states in the US (1). Schools were selected through a multi-
stage random sampling procedure; first geographic areas were
selected, then schools within geographic areas, and then
classes within selected schools. Constructs assessed were
divided into six questionnaire forms and distributed randomly.
This study focuses on data collected through Form 1, the only
form that assesses hashish use, in addition to general
marijuana use and sociodemographics. Analyses focused on
data collected from high school seniors in years 2007­2011
(2011 was the last year recreational marijuana use was still
illegal in all US states). Student response rates in 2007­2011
were 79­85% (1).
Variables
With regard to sociodemographic variables, MTF assessed
student sex, age (dichotomized as 518 vs. 18), and race/
ethnicity (i.e. white, black, Hispanic). Population density was
categorized by non-, small, and large metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as counties or groups
of counties with at least one city of 50 000 inhabitants and
the 24 largest MSAs are defined as large MSAs. Non-MSAs
are the remaining areas (1). Religiosity was assessed via a
composite of two ordinal items which assessed religious
attendance and importance (range: 1­4). We divided the
mean-composite into tertiles indicating low (1.0­2.0), mod-
erate (2.5­3.0) and high (3.5­4.0) religiosity (23).
To assess family structure, students were asked to indicate
with which parent(s) they resided. Students answered whether
they resided with no parents, one parent or two parents. The
level of educational attainment of the parents was assessed via
ordinal scales and a mean score for both parents (or raw score
if only one parent) was coded into three groups representing
low (1.0­3.0), medium (3.5­4.0), and high (4.5­6.0) educa-
tion. Students were also asked about the number of evenings
they usually go out per week for fun and recreation and we
coded answers into: (1) 0­1 evening(s), (2) 2­3 evenings, and
(3) 4­7 evenings. Student weekly income was assessed
by asking how much money the student earns during the
average week from: (1) a job or other work, and (2) from
``other sources''. We recoded responses for each item
into $10 or less, $11­50, or $51 or more. Coding of
sociodemographic variables was guided by previous research
(3,4,19,20,23­25).
With respect to drug use, students were asked about
frequency of lifetime use of marijuana, alcohol (``more than
just a few sips''), cigarettes and select illicit drugs. Students
were asked, ``On how many occasions (if any) have you used
marijuana in your lifetime?'' The survey reminded students
that ``Marijuana is sometimes called weed, pot, dope; hashish
is sometimes called: hash, hash oil'' and then asked, ``On
how many occasions (if any) have you used hashish in your
lifetime?'' The same questions were asked for use in the last
12 months. Possible responses for these questions were:
0 occasions, 1­2 occasions, 3­5 occasions, 6­9 occasions,
10­19 occasions, 20­39 occasions, and 40+ occasions. We
dichotomized recent (12 months) hashish use (into yes/no)
and also created a trichotomous variable indicating: (1) no
recent use of either, (2) recent use of marijuana, but not
hashish, and (3) recent use of hashish (regardless of other
marijuana use).
The same response options applied to lifetime use of
alcohol and other illicit drugs. The illicit drugs considered
in this study were powder cocaine, crack, heroin, LSD, and
hallucinogens other than LSD. With regard to nonmedical
(illicit) use of prescription drugs, this study considered use
of amphetamine/controlled stimulants, narcotics other than
heroin, tranquilizers/benzodiazepines, and sedatives/barbit-
urates. We dichotomized use of each of any of these nine
illicit drugs into lifetime use: yes/no. Lifetime alcohol use
was dichotomized into use on 510 vs. 10 occasions.
Lifetime cigarette use was assessed via an ordinal item with
different answer options: never, once or twice, occasionally
but not regularly, regularly in the past, regularly now. We
collapsed the two regular smoker categories because no
recent marijuana users identified as past regular smokers.
Finally, students who indicated use of marijuana in the last
12 months were asked, ``What have been the most
important reasons for your using marijuana or hashish?''
Students were asked to answer yes/no to 11 items (listed
in Table 2).

Analyses
Descriptive statistics were first examined. We then analyzed
data for the 10 597 students (Weighted n) with complete drug
use data. Specifically, we fit two conditional multinomial
logistic regression models to delineate correlates of (1)
hashish use (regardless of other marijuana use), and (2) other
marijuana use (marijuana users not indicating hashish use)
compared to no use. The first model contained only socio-
demographic variables; the second model also contained drug
use variables. We controlled for a variety of sociodemo-
graphic variables commonly utilized in other MTF analyses
(3,4,19,20,23,25). In these conditional models, each covariate
was associated with its own adjusted odds ratio (AOR) in
explaining each categorical outcome (compared to no use).
Two binary conditional models were then computed focusing
on the subsample of recent (12 months) marijuana users
(n ¼ 2650) in order to more directly examine differences
between both forms. The first model contained only socio-
demographic variables and the second model also contained
drug use variables. For consistency, we entered the same
sociodemographic covariates, but in the second model we also
included (1) frequency of recent marijuana use, and (2)
reasons for marijuana use (which were only assessed with
regard to recent use).
All models were adjusted by cohort with indicators for
each year (with year 2007 as the comparison) included (26).
Multivariable models included missing data indicators for
covariates with missing data in order to maximize sample
size. For example, 14.9% of the sample was missing race and
26.3% were missing religiosity. Utilizing case-complete data
(with no missing values) would have required the deletion of
roughly half of the sample. Including a missing data indicator
for covariates with missing data allowed the full analytic
sample to be retained. Thus, each model technically contained
no missing data, which would have led to listwise deletion of
missing cases. In order to ensure that inclusion of missing
data indicators did not bias results, all models were
recomputed using case-complete data and results were
almost identical. This is also commonly done in other MTF
analyses (3,20,25,27). All analyses were design-based for
complex survey data (28), weighted accorded to the study's
sampling scheme, and conducted using SAS 9.3 software.
Results
As shown in Table 1, the majority of the sample was white or
resided in an MSA. A quarter (25.1%) of recent marijuana
users reported lifetime hashish use (9.4% of the full sample)
and 18.3% of recent marijuana users reported recent
(12 month) use of hashish (6.5% of the full sample).
Percentages of students indicating specific reasons for use
are presented in Table 2.
With regard to recent use among the full sample (Table 3),
compared to males, females were at low odds for hashish use,
and older students were at decreased odds for both forms only
when controlling for other drug use. Compared to white
students, black and Hispanic students were at low odds for use
of hashish, but when controlling for other drug use,
black students were at more than double the odds for
using each form of marijuana, and the Hispanic association
lost significance. Residing in an MSA somewhat consistently
increased the odds for use of each form, and religiosity was
protective against both forms, particularly hashish, and
highest religiosity was associated with lower odds. Residing
with one or two parents was protective against use of both
forms, but controlling for other drug use, residing with two
parents remained a protective factor against other marijuana
use, but not hashish. Number of evenings out per week
robustly increased odds of use of each form, particularly
hashish, even when controlling for other drug use. Higher
income from a job or other sources tended to be a strong risk
factor for use of each form, but when controlling for other
drug use, high income from job (4$50/week) increased odds
for use of hashish (AOR ¼ 1.38, p ¼ 0.019), but not other
marijuana. Frequent alcohol use robustly increased odds for
use of hashish (AOR ¼ 7.80, p50.001), more so than other
marijuana (AOR ¼ 4.27, p50.001). All levels of cigarette
smoking strongly increased odds for use of each form,
particularly hashish. Regular cigarette smoking was asso-
ciated with a robust increased in odds of hashish use
(AOR ¼ 18.70, p50.001). Likewise, other illicit drug use
increased odds of hashish use, more so than it increased odds
for other marijuana use.
Among recent marijuana users (Table 4), compared to
males, females were consistently at lower odds for hashish use
although this association weakened when controlling for other
drug use. Compared to white students, black students were at
strongly reduced odds for hashish use and Hispanics were also
at low risk; however, after controlling for other drug use,
black students were at half the odds for hashish use
(AOR ¼ 0.48, p ¼ 0.026) and identifying as Hispanic was no
longer significant. Compared to less religious students,
moderate and highly religious students were at low risk for
hashish use, but these significant associations disappeared
when controlling for other drug use. Going out 4­7 evenings
per week and earning 4$50 per week from a job were risk
factors for hashish use, but these significant associations also
disappeared when controlling for other drug use. Frequent
alcohol use, regular cigarette smoking and other illicit drug
use all increased odds for hashish use, and as frequency of
recent marijuana use increased, odds for use of hashish
increased. Finally, with regard to reasons for marijuana use,
using to seek deeper insight and understanding was associated
with increased odds for hashish use (AOR ¼ 1.51, p ¼ 0.009)
and using because the student felt he or she was ``hooked''
almost doubled the odds of hashish use (AOR ¼ 1.94,
p ¼ 0.024).
Discussion
The recent increase in popularity of marijuana use coupled
with more liberal state-level polices has begun to change the
landscape of adolescent marijuana use. More potent forms of
marijuana, such as hashish, may present a threat to adolescent
health. This is the first paper to examine correlates of hashish
use in a nationally representative sample of US high school
students. Data from MTF indicates that nearly half (45.5%) of
high school seniors have used marijuana at some point in their
lives, with a third (36.4%) using it in the past year (1). We
examined data from MTF, years 2007­2011 and found that

hashish has been used by nearly one out of ten high school
seniors. Our findings suggest that (1) users of both forms of
marijuana share many of the same risk factors; but (2) various
factors tend to be bigger risk factors for hashish use as
compared to general marijuana use.
Many sociodemographic factors explaining general mari-
juana use were similar to those of hashish use; however, we
delineated numerous differences in associations, which were
often stronger for hashish. Females were consistently at low
risk for hashish use, but not general marijuana use. In some
respects, these findings corroborate previous research that
females tend to be at low risk for ``harder'' drugs than males
(20,25,29,30). Hashish tends to be much more potent than
other marijuana, and it is primarily the males that are at
higher risk for use of this more potent form. Males are also at
higher risk for marijuana dependence (30,31) so further
research is needed to examine whether this high potency form
of marijuana increases the risk of problematic use patterns.
One particularly consistent difference across use of
different forms of marijuana was that students with higher
income (earning4$50 per week from a job) were at increased
odds for use of hashish, but not for general marijuana, at least
until controlling for other drug use. This corroborates prior
research showing that access to higher income can be
associated with risk-taking behavior, including drug use
(19,20,25,32,33). This association may be due to socio-
economic status ­ as indicated by higher income ­ or simply
the fact that money is often needed to purchase drugs
(20,32,34­36).
Important race/ethnicity findings were delineated from
these analyses. Compared to non-users, black and Hispanic
students were at low risk for hashish use, but not other
marijuana. However, when controlling for other drug use,
identifying as Hispanic was no longer protective against
hashish use, and black students were at more than double the
risk for use of both forms. Interestingly, looking more
specifically into the marijuana-using subsample, blacks were
(again) only at half the odds for hashish use. So while black
students are at risk for general marijuana use (compared to
non-users) while controlling for drug use and other factors,
they are actually at low risk for hashish use. This finding
can help inform interpretation of other national reports that
also suggest higher reported rates of marijuana use among
whites (e.g. the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
[NSDUH]) (15,37). However, despite blacks using at lower
rates into adulthood, marijuana-related arrest and incarcer-
ation rates are higher for blacks throughout many US cities
(38). We found that among marijuana users, blacks are at
low risk for recent hashish use; however, further research
needs to be conducted to determine whether this racial-
protective factor paradoxically places blacks at greater risk
for arrest. Since hashish is often ingested rather than
smoked, blacks who smoke (e.g. in public) may be at
greater risk for arrest since most other non-hashish mari-
juana is smoked and thus has a strong odor that can lead to
detection by authorities.
Another key finding was that other drug use was a robust
risk factor for hashish use. Specifically, other illicit drug use,
regular cigarette smoking and frequent alcohol use each
increased the risk for use. Results also indicate that higher
frequency of cigarette smoking increases odds of use, but
frequency of recent marijuana use was perhaps the most
robust risk factor, with more frequent use more strongly
increasing odds of using hashish. While temporality could not
be determined, it may be that those who use non-hashish
marijuana very frequently are more likely to be exposed to
and/or eventually use this more potent version of the drug. It
may also be that higher frequency marijuana use may be
linked to increased tolerance, leading many users to seek this
more potent marijuana product. In addition, including other
drug use in models often drowned out ­ or in some cases,
reversed ­ associations of sociodemographic variables. Many
studies do not control for drug use in models, and this finding
points to the importance of doing so because associations
commonly change in light of these factors (25).
In addition, we examined how reasons for marijuana use
relate to hashish use and found that those who use to seek
deeper insights or understanding, a common reason for
hallucinogen use (39), are at increased odds for hashish use.
Alarmingly, those who said they are ``hooked'' on marijuana
were at nearly double the odds for use (with more than half of
those who felt they were hooked reporting hashish use). This
finding helps shed some light regarding understudied aspects
of marijuana dependence. Perhaps in some cases hashish use
can be viewed as a form of marijuana use ``severity'' (40,41)
as it tends to be more potent, used among more frequent
marijuana users, and many marijuana users who feel they are
dependent also use this form of the drug.
Limitations
Since this study was cross-sectional, temporality could not be
inferred. Missing data, particularly of religiosity and race, was
problematic; however, we included missing data indicators in
models in order to avoid listwise deletion, as has been done in
previous studies. We also computed case-complete models
with no missing data to ensure that results from our fully-
retained analytic sample were similar. Hashish (not collapsed
with general marijuana use) was only assessed in a sixth of the
sample each year so we combined cohorts from five years into
a single cross-section to increase power. Hashish use did not
significantly differ over time, giving us confidence in
combining cohorts. State-level MTF data are not available
so it is unknown which students resided in a state where
medical marijuana was legal or available. It is possible that

students in states with medical marijuana dispensaries might
have had easier access to hashish (e.g. through diversion) than
students in non-medical marijuana states. Although recre-
ational use was illegal in all states during the years of this
study, it is unknown how results apply to states where
recreational marijuana use is now legal. MTF also did not ask
about method of use (e.g. smoked, ingested). Finally,
MTF does not include students who were no longer
enrolled or dropped out of school before their final year of
high school.
Conclusions
This was the first national study to examine correlates of
hashish use. We delineated various correlates of use, which
were often different (or stronger) in comparison to use of
other marijuana. Frequent marijuana users and those who use
marijuana because they feel they are ``hooked'' are at high
risk for hashish use, so in some instances hashish use can be

other variables were controlled in the multivariable models. The models included cohort and missing data indicators. Results were computed both
with and without the missing data indicators and results were nearly identical. Percentages listed for reasons for marijuana use compare those who
checked off ``yes'' to that reason (e.g. 55.1% of those who said they used hashish because they were hooked used hashish). MSA, metropolitan
