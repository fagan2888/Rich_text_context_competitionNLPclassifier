Introduction
Over the past three decades, increased attention has been
paid to interpersonal violence on college campuses, yet only
a limited number of empirical studies have focused on abuse
among college students with disabilities, particularly stu-
dents that are Deaf or hard of hearing (Anderson & Leigh,
2011; Mason, 2010; Porter & McQuiller Williams, 2011a,
2011b). The small body of existing research on violence
against persons that are Deaf and hard of hearing indicate
that prevalence rates of experiencing interpersonal violence
are more than doubled for Deaf and hard of hearing individu-
als in college samples and community populations when
compared with hearing populations (Anderson, 2010;
Anderson & Leigh, 2011; Barnett, McKee, Smith, & Pearson,
2011; Porter & McQuiller Williams, 2011a, 2011b).
Despite the growing literature on the victimization expe-
riences of Deaf and hard of hearing individuals, these inves-
tigations have not yet queried whether there are differences
in experiences of physical and psychological abuse in inti-
mate relationships between Deaf college students and hard of
hearing college students. Previous research recommends the
need to explore whether risk factors vary between Deaf and
hard of hearing individuals and suggest that hard of hearing
individuals may face a greater risk of victimization than Deaf
individuals given that hard of hearing individuals are often
members of mainstream culture and a Deaf subculture
(Barrow, 2008). In response to this recommendation, the cur-
rent study extends the literature on intimate partner violence
(IPV) by providing a more comprehensive investigation of
abuse by comparing the victimization experiences of Deaf
and hard of hearing college students and examining whether
risk factors for physical and psychological victimization
vary between Deaf and hard of hearing college students.
The question about possible differences arises from the
dangers inherent in aggregating groups that have similar char-
acteristics but are not alike in many very important ways.
Disaggregating Deaf and hard of hearing individuals also
illustrates the importance for health professionals of avoiding
a "one size fits all" approach to addressing interpersonal vio-
lence in these communities. While Deaf and hard of hearing
individuals experience hearing loss, the term deaf (lower case
"d") refers to individuals "that are medically incapable of
hearing" and hard of hearing refers to "individuals for whom
the sense of hearing, although defective, is functional with or
without a hearing aid" (Barrow, 2008, pp. 9-10). The use of
the capital "D" is to acknowledge the unique cultural identity

A Comparison of Deaf College Students'
and Hard of Hearing College Students'
Experiences and Risk Factors of
Psychological and Physical Abuse
LaVerne McQuiller Williams1 and Judy L. Porter1
Abstract
A survey of 222 Deaf or hard of hearing college students in an upstate New York university provided a unique opportunity
to explore possible differences between Deaf students' and hard of hearing students' experiences and risk factors of
psychological and physical abuse in their intimate relationships. Previous research has indicated that Deaf and hard of
hearing college students in the aggregate were significantly more likely to experience abuse than were hearing students. A
comparison of Deaf students with hard of hearing students revealed that hard of hearing individuals were significantly more
likely to experience physical abuse than were Deaf students but not more likely to experience psychological abuse. Findings
also revealed that in most cases, traditional risk factors for partner violence (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, living on campus)
used in hearing college samples were not significant. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

of Deaf individuals. This includes a strong affiliation to the
Deaf community and a shared language (American Sign
Language [ASL]; Anderson, Leigh, & Samar, 2011).
Moreover, language, communication, and culture are radi-
cally dissimilar for Deaf students and for hard of hearing indi-
viduals. Individuals who identify with the Deaf culture share a
common language and culture that embodies many subtle
ways of communication beyond the use of ASL. For example,
Deaf culture shares music, literature, plays, and other means
of interaction that are by necessity dissimilar from the main-
stream (Holcomb, 2013; Marschark & Spencer, 2010).
Hard of hearing individuals may or may not use ASL as
their primary language and ASL may not be used at all. Hard
of hearing individuals may or may not identify with Deaf
culture (Kersting, 1997). Research suggests that hard of
hearing college students evidence some difficulty in feelings
of belonging to Deaf culture or to the mainstream, and some
hard of hearing individuals have expressed that they do not
feel they belong to either group--Deaf or hearing, and do not
experience a culture among hard of hearing individuals
(Kersting, 1997). Mainstreaming Deaf or hard of hearing stu-
dents in their primary or high school education may affect
individuals' ability to join either group. For example, if a
hard of hearing individual is mainstreamed early in their edu-
cation he or she may not learn ASL fluently, if at all, having
developed other communication strategies.
Using a survey instrument with a sample of college stu-
dents in the northeastern United States, the current study
sought to compare two forms of dating violence, psychologi-
cal and physical abuse, between Deaf college students and
hard of hearing college students. The importance of examin-
ing psychological abuse with physical abuse has been noted
(Raghavan, Swan, Snow, & Mazure, 2005) and previous
research indicates that psychological abuse often occurs in
conjunction with other forms of abuse (Aosved & Long,
2005). Psychological abuse refers to "words or actions [used]
to isolate, humiliate, demean or control an intimate partner"
(Rohrbaugh, 2006, p. 291). Research suggests that psycho-
logical abuse may have as great a negative impact on vic-
tims, if not greater, than physical violence (Adams, Sullivan,
Bybee, & Greeson, 2008; Henning & Klesges, 2003).
Physical and Psychological Abuse in
U.S. College Populations
Recent estimates suggest that nearly one third of college stu-
dents have experienced some form of physical abuse in a dat-
ing relationship (Orcutt, Garcia, & Pickett, 2005; Perry &
Fromuth, 2005). Psychological abuse is more commonly
reported than physical abuse in college dating relationships
with as many as 80% of college students reporting experi-
encing such abuse (Avant, Swopes, Davis, & Elhai, 2011;
Cercone, Beach, & Arias, 2005; Forke, Myers, Catallozzi, &
Schwartz, 2008; Harned, 2001; Hines & Saudino, 2003).
Previous research has identified several risk factors for
dating violence. Risk factors for dating violence are variables
that are associated with its increased probability, but are not
necessarily direct causes (Medeiros & Straus, 2006, p. 4). In
the current study, a number of risk factors--gender, living
alone, living on campus, and race/ethnicity--were included
due to prior research with hearing samples that has found a
relationship between these variables and victimization.
Regarding gender, men and women have been found to per-
petrate and experience abuse while in college. For example in
a review of 15 studies examining female perpetrated physical
abuse and psychological abuse among college students, in 14
of the 15 studies, rates for physical abuse ranged from 11.7%
to 39% and 5 of the 15 studies reported rates of 40.4% to
89.3% for psychological abuse (Williams, Ghandour, & Kub,
2008). Recent research by Forke et al. (2008) of 910 women
and men, conducted on three college campuses, found more
than half of the abusive acts reported, including slapping and
insulting, were perpetrated by a partner, and were more likely
to be physical or emotional violence. More than half of col-
lege women and more than one fourth of college men had
been victimized in their lifetime. During their college years,
10.2% of women and 2.8% of men experienced physical
abuse and 16.2% of women and 5.9% of men reported expe-
riencing psychological abuse. Cercone et al.'s (2005) study of
college men and women found that women, more than men,
reported committing physical assault. Other studies suggest
that the rates of receiving and inflicting abuse are similar
(Harned, 2001; Perry & Fromuth, 2005).
Previous research also suggests that living arrangements
may be associated with victimization risk, whereby college
students that live independently and off campus may be more
vulnerable than those living with others and on campus
(Forke et al., 2008; Lehrer, Lehrer, Lehrer, & Oyarzun,
2007). Some research also suggests that race/ethnicity may
be associated with the risk of victimization, although studies
are inconclusive. For example, some research has found
higher rates of interpersonal violence among African
Americans and Hispanic couples when compared with
Whites (Caetano, Schafer, & Cunradi, 2001; Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2010; Eaton, Dais, Barrios,
Brener, & Noonan, 2007; Howard, Qiu, & Boekeloo, 2003)
while other studies have found no differences across racial/
ethnic groups (Coker et al., 2000; Field & Caetano, 2004;
Temple & Freeman, 2011).
Physical and Psychological Abuse
Among Deaf and Hard of Hearing
College Students
There are nearly half a million Deaf people in the United
States (Mitchell, Young, Bachleda, & Karchmer, 2006). In
the United States, Deaf people do not see themselves as
having a disability, but rather have a culture and way of
McQuiller Williams and Porter 3
communication that is denied by the dominate hearing cul-
ture (Holcomb, 2013; Sadusky & Obinna, 2002). While
there is mounting evidence concerning the victimization
experiences of people with disabilities (Anderson et al.,
2011; Brownridge, 2009; Johnston-McCabe, Levi-Minzi,
Van Hasselt, & Vanderbeek, 2011; Nannini, 2006; Powers
et al., 2009), only a handful of empirical studies have
addressed Deaf and hard of hearing college students' expe-
riences with dating violence. Recent studies using college
samples in the United States indicate that Deaf and hard of
hearing individuals as an aggregate experience interper-
sonal violence at more than double the rate of hearing pop-
ulations (Anderson, 2010; Anderson & Leigh, 2011; Porter
& McQuiller Williams, 2011a, 2011b). For example, in a
recent study conducted by Anderson and Leigh (2010), a
significantly higher proportion of Deaf women undergradu-
ates at a college in Washington, D.C., reported IPV victim-
ization (i.e., physical assault and psychological aggression)
than did hearing students in the previous year. Using a ran-
dom sample of more than 1,000 college men and women,
including more than 200 Deaf or hard of hearing students at
a large U.S. northeastern university, it was found that Deaf
or hard of hearing college students were twice as likely
to report experiencing psychological abuse and nearly
2.5 times more likely to report experiencing physical abuse
at the hands of a partner than were hearing students in the
prior year (Porter & McQuiller Williams, 2011a, 2011b).
Studies of IPV among Deaf or hard of hearing college
students as a group at a predominantly Deaf college in
Washington, D.C., found psychological abuse to be more
prevalent (30%) than physical abuse (11%) in their current
relationships among the Deaf or hard of hearing men and
women respondents (Mason, 2010). Anderson and Leigh's
(2011) study of IPV during the last 12 months among 100
Deaf and hard of hearing undergraduate women students at
the same university found psychological abuse to be much
more prevalent (more than 90%) than physical abuse and
50% had been the victim of a physical assault.
Given the exploratory nature of this study, the research
questions guiding this study are as follows:
Research Question 1: Are there differences in experi-
ences of physical and/or psychological victimization
between Deaf college students and hard of hearing col-
lege students?
Research Question 2: Do risk factors for physical and
psychological victimization vary between Deaf and hard
of hearing college students?
Method
Data Collection
The data for this study were collected from college students
at a university in upstate New York. Forty classes that were
limited to Deaf and hard of hearing college students were
randomly selected. After receiving approval from the
Institutional Review Board at Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT), pen-and-paper questionnaires were dis-
tributed within those classes to students. A total of 222
respondents participated and the response rate was 100%.
Measures
The dependent variables for analysis were dummy variables
created from a variety of questions pertaining to psychologi-
cal and physical abuse. To measure psychological and physi-
cal abuse among dating partners within the past school year,
a modified version of Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, and
Sugarman's (1996) Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2)
was used to measure IPV by "a partner" over the previous
school year. Use of the term partner denotes IPV may exist
among heterosexual and same-sex partners. The CTS2 is a
commonly used measure of IPV that measures the frequency
with which respondents had experienced psychological and
physical abuse from their dating partners. Three items
assessed psychological abuse (e.g., insults and threats;
Cronbach's  = .592). Seven items assessed physical abuse
(e.g., slapping, kicking, choking, and beat up; Cronbach's
 = .768). Subjects responded on a 4-point scale (never, 1-2
times, 3-10 times, more than 10 times).
Auditory status is the primary independent variable of
interest. Auditory status was measured with the question:
"Which best describes your auditory status?" Students were
able to answer hard of hearing or Deaf. As discussed in the
literature review, gender, living alone, living on campus, and
race/ethnicity were included as variables due to prior research
with hearing samples that has found a relationship between
these variables and victimization. The victimization vari-
ables were dummy variables that indicated the presence or
absence of abuse. Binary logistic regression analyses were
used to examine the effect of auditory status and other vari-
ables on physical and psychological victimization. Data were
analyzed using SPSS PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS, 2009).
Characteristics of the Sample
The sample of Deaf and hard of hearing students were nearly
equal in gender and included 104 males (46.8%) and
118 females (53.2%). The majority of students were Deaf
(n = 170, 76.6%) participants and 52 (23.4%) of the partici-
pants were hard of hearing. The majority of respondents
were White (n = 152, 68.5%) with 22 African Americans
(10%), 10 Hispanic/Latino(a) (4.5%), 24 Asian/Pacific
Islander (10.8%), and 12 American Indian/Alaskan Native
(5.4%). The sample was a little older with 96 students who
were below 21 years of age with 126 students who were 21
years of age or more. Although none of the demographic
indicators were statistically significant and associated with
4 SAGE Open
either Deaf or hard of hearing, it is interesting to note that
more women were Deaf and more men were hard of hearing.
Women were in the majority in the 21 years and older cate-
gory for both auditory groups (Table 1).
Results
Psychological Abuse
The most prevalent type of abuse at the hands of a partner
was psychological abuse with 136 students or 61.3% of the
sample reporting such abuse. Of those experiencing psycho-
logical abuse within the past year, 61.7% experienced at least
one incident of abuse 1 to 2 times, while 38.3% experienced
at least one incident of abuse 3 times or more. When auditory
status is disaggregated, 63.5% (n = 31) of hard of hearing
students and 61.6% (n = 113) of Deaf students reported expe-
riencing psychological abuse by their partner in the past
school year. Table 2 reports the binary regression results for
psychological abuse using PASW Statistics 18. The binary
regression analysis includes Deaf, hard of hearing, gender,
race, and whether one lived on or off the college campus.
Living off campus was the only variable that was statistically
significant and associated with psychological abuse in a
binomial regression analysis that included Deaf or hard of
hearing, residence, gender, and race. Those students who
lived off campus were at a greater risk of experiencing psy-
chological abuse than were those students who lived on cam-
pus (odds ratio [OR] = 0.604, p  .087).
Physical Abuse
A significant number of Deaf and hard of hearing students
experienced physical abuse by their partner in the last school
year, with 88 students or 39.6% of the sample reporting such
abuse. Of those experiencing physical abuse within the past
year, 52.7% experienced at least one incident of abuse 1 to
2 times, while 47.3% experienced at least one incident of
abuse 3 times or more. When auditory status is disaggre-
gated, 53.8% (n = 28) hard of hearing students and 35.3%
(n = 60) of Deaf students reported experiencing physical
abuse by their partner in the past school year. Fifty out of 104
men reported physical abuse (48%) while 38 out of 118
women (32%) in the sample reported physical abuse. A

binomial regression analysis that included gender, race, deaf
or hard of hearing, and residence revealed two variables
were statistically significant and associated with physical
abuse (Table 3). The binomial regression found that male
respondents (OR = 0.544, p  .031) and hard of hearing stu-
dents (OR = 1.994, p  .034) were more likely to suffer phys-
ical abuse. While both groups were more at risk of physical
abuse, the effect is greater for hard of hearing students. The
strongest association in both analyses is for being hard of
hearing and physical abuse with hard of hearing students
experiencing nearly twice the risk of physical abuse than
Deaf students.
Discussion
Findings from this study were consistent with existing stud-
ies that indicate that among Deaf and hard of hearing college
students, physical abuse and psychological abuse are alarm-
ingly high (Anderson & Leigh, 2011; Porter & McQuiller
Williams, 2011a, 2011b). While research on violence among
college students has historically neglected the experiences of
members of underrepresented groups such as Deaf and hard
of hearing students, results of this study provide data on
these relatively unexamined populations. The current study
is unique because it is the first to disaggregate the victimiza-
tion experiences of Deaf and hard of hearing students.
The results of this study illustrate the importance for col-
lege health professionals and others dealing with college
populations of avoiding a "one size fits all" approach to
addressing dating violence. A substantially high number of
hard of hearing and Deaf students reported experiencing psy-
chological abuse, although in the current study there was not
a significant difference between these groups. For the entire
sample, with the exception of living off campus, no other
traditional risk factors for psychological dating violence
were significant. This suggests the need to investigate factors
other than those relied on with hearing college samples to
understand the dynamics of dating violence victimization
among Deaf and hard of hearing college students.
For physical abuse, a significant difference was found
between hard of hearing and Deaf students, with hard of
hearing students more likely to experience such abuse.
Barrow (2008) suggests that because hard of hard hearing
individuals are often members of both Deaf culture main-
stream (hearing) culture, this places them at a greater risk of
abuse than Deaf individuals. As Anderson et al. (2011)
acknowledges, within the dynamics of the relationships that
include one hearing partner and a hard of hearing partner,
there lays the potential for the hearing partner to abuse their
hearing privilege. This may include the perpetrator using
their hearing to manipulate the victim (not share with him or
her what is being said) and/or communicating with police
officers and others because they are hearing (Deaf Hope,
2006). This suggests the need for more directed research,
including qualitative studies, on victimization and factors
that contribute to it on college campuses.
When developing interventions to prevent incidences or
to intervene in cases of relationship violence, it is important
to understand that hard of hearing students may face differ-
ent issues than Deaf students. Deaf students may have more
of a support group than hard of hearing students via a shared
Deaf culture and primary language--ASL (Kersting, 1997).
Hard of hearing students may not use ASL as their primary
language or at all and may not identify with or be accepted
into Deaf culture (Kersting, 1997). Hard of hearing students
do not view themselves as a culturally distinct group as do
many of the Deaf students and may find acceptance into
hearing groups difficult as well (Kersting, 1997). More
knowledge is needed about the cultural assimilation and
identification of hard of hearing students as well as their
experiences with abuse.
Among the traditional risk factors used to examine dating
violence in hearing college samples, only gender was signifi-
cant, with males more likely to experience physical abuse
than women. While this finding is consistent with previous
research (Cercone et al., 2005), females receive far more
physical injuries as a result of dating violence than do males
(Straus & Ramirez, 2007). Accordingly, future research
should examine the injuries sustained in violent dating
situations.
Although the current study extends research on IPV in
underrepresented groups, findings should be viewed with
caution in light of several limitations. First, data were
obtained by self-report. Thus, the possibility of deliberate
response distortion must be considered. Second, present
findings may not generalize beyond the particular sample.

We note our sample consisted of a small number of Deaf and
hard of hearing college men and women attending a mid-
sized, private institution who may differ from other groups in
their experiences of received psychological and physical
abuse. The study does, however, provide evidence for future
comparisons. Future studies would benefit from a multi-
campus approach. A study that looks at multiple universities
or colleges could help in removing any biases inherent in one
university or college.
Additional research on partner violence among underrep-
resented groups is clearly warranted. Substantiation of the
present findings, which indicate that partner abuse occurs
with frequency among Deaf and hard of hearing college stu-
dents, that hard of hearing students have significantly higher
rates of physical abuse, and that most traditional risk factors
for dating violence among hearing college samples are not
significant when examined for Deaf and hard of hearing stu-
dents, is crucial for the dissemination of educational infor-
mation. When developing programs and services, college
health professionals must strive for inclusivity, as well as
develop targeted approaches for outreach to populations on
their campuses that may be at greater risk of abuse.
