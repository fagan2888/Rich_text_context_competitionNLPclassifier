Article
Background
Research shows that approximately 20% of long-term care
(LTC) residents die each year (Canadian Institute for Health
Information, 2012; Statistics Canada, 2011; Travis et al.,
2002), with expectation that this number will reach almost
40% by 2020 (Ross, Fisher, & McLean, 2000). However,
there is a major gap in the research regarding LTC staff and
how they cope with the substantial losses that they deal with
regularly in their profession. A recent study (Osterlind,
Hansebo, Andersson, Ternestedt, & Hellstrom, 2011) recog-
nizes the discourse of silence surrounding death and dying in
LTC, noting that staff keep death at a distance by concentrat-
ing on tasks and routines. Emotions are pushed to the back-
ground, and death is surrounded by silence (Cocco, Gatti, de
Mendonça Lima, & Camus, 2003; Hopkinson, Hallett, &
Luker, 2005; Jenull & Brunner, 2008; Moss, Moss,
Rubinstein, & Black, 2003; Wilson & Kirshbaum, 2011).
This experience has been well documented in the litera-
ture as disenfranchised grief (Black & Rubenstein, 2004;
Boerner, Burack, Jopp, & Mock, 2015; Slocum-Gori,
Hemsworth, Chan, Carson, & Kazanjian, 2013; Thompson
& Bevan, 2015). Unregulated health care professionals as
identified in the Osterlind et al. (2011) study are direct care
staff in LTC homes who provide multidimensional (physical,
emotional, spiritual, and social) care to residents. Due to the
encompassing and time-consuming nature of their caregiv-
ing roles, the relationships that form between front-line staff
and nursing home residents can be extremely close, and in
some instances forged over years of providing intimate care
(Anderson & Gaugler, 2006-2007). For staff, the deaths of
residents may be equivalent to the deaths of family members,
evoking strong grief reactions that are compounded with
each accumulated loss. The failure to acknowledge the rela-
tionships between staff and residents, and the denial of deaths
in nursing homes, may preclude direct care staff from effec-
tively moving through their grief process (Anderson &
Gaugler, 2006-2007). It is therefore essential for LTC homes
to promote policies and practices that support a healthy
grieving process for staff, and to implement innovative strat-
egies to validate, enfranchise, and improve the process of
working through the disenfranchised grief that direct care
staff may experience after the death of LTC home residents.

Abstract
Front-line staff in long-term care (LTC) homes often form strong emotional bonds with residents. When residents die,
staffs' grief often goes unattended, and may result in disenfranchised grief. The aim of this article is to develop, implement,
and assess the benefits of a peer-led debriefing intervention to help staff manage their grief and provide LTC homes an
organizational approach to support them. This research was nested within a 5-year participatory action research to develop
and implement palliative care programs within four LTC homes in Canada. Data specific to this debriefing intervention
included questionnaires from six peer debriefers, field observations of six debriefings, and qualitative interviews with 23 staff
participants. An original peer-led debriefing intervention (INNPUT) for LTC home staff was developed and implemented.
Data revealed that the intervention offered staff an opportunity to express grief in a safe context with others, an opportunity
for closure and acknowledgment. The INNPUT intervention benefits staff and offers an innovative, sustainable, easy to use
strategy for LTC homes.

Based on the above-mentioned research, there is consen-
sus that in fact front-line staff may experience disenfran-
chised grief, which in turn impacts their mental health and
well-being. The new matter, then, is how to effectively sup-
port direct care staff in assisting them to manage and prevent
disenfranchised grief symptoms.
Direct care staff, consisting of registered nurses (RNs),
registered practical nurses (RPNs), and front-line staff (often
referred to in the literature as personal support workers,
health care aids, nurse's aides, or nursing assistants) who
work in LTC homes, can expect to experience the effects of
loss and grief as a result of the death of residents for whom
they have provided care. Front-line staff in particular provide
daily care and form significant relationships with residents
and their families.Although the issue of managing disenfran-
chised grief is important for all direct care staff, this article
focuses specifically on the front-line worker. For the pur-
poses of this article, the generic term unregulated care
provider(s) (UCP) will be used to describe the front-line
worker responsible for the majority of the resident's daily
health care needs.
Objective
The concept of disenfranchised grief has been well researched
and supported in the literature. This article builds on the
research and literature concerning disenfranchised grief by
developing an intervention aimed to mitigate its effects on
UCP in LTC homes.
There are two objectives that this article is reporting on.
The first objective was to develop an organizational inter-
vention based on current literature and in collaboration with
UCPs, aimed to ease the effects of grief and prevent disen-
franchised grief. The second objective was to gauge the per-
ceived benefit of the developed intervention tool (INNPUT)
through the use of follow-up qualitative questionnaires, indi-
vidual interviews, and transcript review of participants'
feedback.
Context and Method of the Research
A5-year study (2009-2014) was conducted in four LTC homes
in Ontario, Canada, with the purpose of improving the quality
of life for people who are dying in LTC by creating formalized
palliative care programs that can be sustained within the LTC
homes beyond completion of the project (see www.pallia-
tivealliance.ca). The project was completed through the col-
laboration and active participation of four key partners:
Lakehead University, McMaster University, St. Joseph's Care
Group, and the Municipalities of Halton and Niagara. These
partners created the Quality Palliative Care in Long Term Care
(QPC-LTC) Alliance, consisting of 25 researchers and 40
organizations, to help facilitate the project goals. The over-
arching goal of this project was to develop palliative care pro-
grams, using Kelley's capacity development model for LTC
and a participatory action research (PAR) approach (Kelley &
McKee, 2013). A toolkit, available on the project website, was
created that includes a framework for developing palliative
care in LTC and more than 40 research-informed innovations,
interventions, tools, and resources that support development
of palliative care in LTC homes.
In the health services context, PAR is a relatively new
approach that brings a social science perspective to knowl-
edge creation to describe, interpret, and explain caregiving as
social rather than medical phenomena. PAR can generate
both practical and theoretical knowledge, and is able to vali-
date old theories or generate new theories from practice
(Webb, 1989). Action research differs from more conven-
tional research paradigms in three ways: its understanding
and use of knowledge, its relationship with research partici-
pants, and the introduction of change into the research pro-
cess (Hockley, Dewar, & Watson, 2005). The goal of PAR is
to create social change in relation to a desired goal through
the empowerment of affected people. The empowerment
process, the change process, and its outcomes are systemati-
cally documented through a variety of data collection meth-
ods before, after, and throughout the research process.
Knowledge is co-created by the researcher and participants
through a reflective spiral of activity: identifying a problem,
planning a change, acting and observing the process and con-
sequences of the change, reflecting on these processes and
consequences, and preplanning, acting, observing, and
reflecting (repeating the cycle; Kemmis & McTaggart,
2000). In this research, PAR was an appropriate methodol-
ogy as it reveals greater complexity than other methods and
can create social change (Kelley & McKee, 2013). It also
recognizes the existing expertise of LTC staff and promotes
integration of palliative care into current practices.
Concepts such as inquiry, learning, participation, and
change were used as part of a process through which the
UCPs were encouraged to share their knowledge about dis-
enfranchised grief and its effects. Acknowledging and vali-
dating the staff's knowledge and experience provided
valuable research and insight to create change opportunities
that will be sustainable over time. This process, one that
encourages mutual respect for knowledge and shared dia-
logue, is part of a PAR process that offers a unique approach
to organizational success (Foley, 2001).
PAR emphasizes the importance of recognizing existing
knowledge, and advocates for conversations that encourage
shared knowledge and learning (Baker, 2001; Bushe, 1999;
Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987; Foley, 2001; Orr, 1996; Patton,
2002; Reason & Bradbury, 2001). Researchers are immersed
in the concept of participatory interaction and learning, recog-
nizing the implications for this type of learning interaction and
dialogue when organizations attempt to implement and sustain
change (Kelley & McKee, 2013). The participatory research
method gathers existing internal knowledge and collective
ideas, and facilitates collaborative constructions. It was these
ongoing collaborative constructions with the UCPs, combined
Vis et al. 3
with research literature that informed the development of the
INNPUT intervention.
To develop the QPC-LTC framework and toolkit, the fol-
lowing five-step process was used: needs assessment, engag-
ing community partners, developing innovations,
implementing and documenting innovations, and creating a
toolkit. In 2009, as a first step, an environmental scan was
conducted, with the results indicating that the UCPs in LTC
homes repeatedly reported a development of close personal
relationships with the residents. These same staff also stated
they experience tremendous loss and grief when a resident
dies. Consequently, a sub-study was undertaken, aiming to
better understand staff's grief experience and to identify their
perceived support needs (Marcella & Kelley, 2015). The
findings, similar to that of the research by Waskiewich, Funk,
and Stajduhar (2012), indicated that the UCP's experiences
with loss and grief are complex, much shaped by the emo-
tional impact of each loss, the cumulative burden of ongoing
grief, and the organizational culture in LTC. The study iden-
tified several recommendations, among them the implemen-
tation of organizational procedures to support staff dealing
with loss and grief, the implementation of organizational
strategies and rituals to acknowledge all residents who die in
the LTC home, and supporting staff with time and resources
to reach out to colleagues after the death of a resident to
acknowledge their loss and grief. Staff strongly indicated the
desire to be supported by their own peers and did not want
external grief counselors introduced (Marcella & Kelley,
2015).
Research Method for Developing the INNPUT
Intervention
The INNPUT intervention evolved as an additional cycle
through the continued practice of PAR within the framework
of the QPC-LTC project. Front-line staff were highly moti-
vated to participate in addressing their identified need for
grief support.
UCPs working in two of the project's LTC homes partici-
pated in implementing and documenting the benefits of the
INNPUT intervention. Several UCPs consulted on the devel-
opment, volunteered to be trained as peer-led debriefers, and
participated in the implementation by promoting the debrief-
ings with their peers.
As noted by Crawford and Bath (2013), "peer driven
research and equitable involvement in research development
should be undertaken to ensure that the needs of the PSW
(UCP)s and peer organizations are better understood" (p. 579).
Through the research, UCPs identified needing a peer support
intervention after the death of a resident. Collaboration
between research staff was continual throughout the develop-
ment of the intervention, ensuring that the peer support con-
text would be effective. Once the intervention was established,
education was provided to volunteer UCPs to become facili-
tators of the intervention. Implementation of six peer-led
interventions was completely facilitated by peer leaders, with
the research staff in presence only as an observer.Atotal of 21
pages of field notes, seven informal personal interviews aver-
aging 20 to 30 min in length, 74 pages of transcription notes,
and six packages of qualitative and quantitative survey evalu-
ations were completed by the peer leaders after each
intervention.
Because UCPs comprise the majority of direct care staff
in LTC homes (Sharkey, 2008), seeking out their expertise
throughout the research process was vital in developing an
intervention for grief support that would meet the needs
identified by the staff. Therefore, PAR offered a method
through which expertise was sought to determine issues, as
well as solutions to managing unresolved disenfranchised
grief. As a result of the above-mentioned sub-study, the con-
cept of a peer-led debriefing intervention was seen as a
potential approach to provide staff with the opportunity to
receive the necessary education, take a step back from the
emotionally stressful event of a resident death, and have their
loss acknowledged. To ensure rigor, the experience and feed-
back of the UCPs were supported by academic literature.
The need to examine information concerning disenfran-
chised grief and potential debriefing interventions was evi-
dent. Based on the current literature, it was determined that
the effects of disenfranchised grief could be mitigated
through a peer debriefing intervention that incorporates edu-
cation, acknowledgment, and support.
Development of the INNPUT
Intervention
Reviewing the Literature
An important stage in the development of the INNPUT inter-
vention involved reviewing literature concerning the LTC
culture, grief, and crisis debriefing models. It was deter-
mined that to develop an intervention tool for support, it was
vital that it be based on current research and practice trends.
It was also important to review literature related to disenfran-
chised grief and its impact to ensure that any key interven-
tions be based on noteworthy research.
Disenfranchised Grief
Doka (1989) describes disenfranchised grief as "the grief
that persons experience when they incur a loss that is not or
cannot be openly acknowledged, publically mourned, or
socially supported" (p. 287). Doka's concept of disenfran-
chised grief is relevant to the LTC culture as ageism and the
frequency of deaths create a belief system that "death is part
of the job." Although the grief process has potential benefits
such as cathartic adjustment and emotional growth, the stress
that is often associated with grief can be debilitating, impart-
ing a global effect that impacts the entire bio-psychosocial
spectrum of life (Anderson & Gaugler, 2006-2007).
4 SAGE Open
UCPs are primarily involved in the direct care of residents
who are at their end of life, and will be increasingly called
upon to provide this care. Providing physical and emotional
comfort to residents along with support to the family, over a
period of years to one's final days, creates experiences not
often understood by many other front-line workers
(Waskiewich et al., 2012). In addition, UCPs often face a
multitude of factors such as clients' difficult behaviors,
demanding work schedules, low salaries, role ambiguity, and
low social recognition (Jenero, Flores, & Arias, 2007).
Consequently, they may be at higher risk for developing
emotional fatigue than others in helping professionals
(Alkema, Linton, & Davies, 2008). The LTC home's culture
rarely includes acknowledgment of an employee's grief, and
dealing with death is considered part of the job. Over time, a
belief emerges that supports the notion that death of a resi-
dent should be expected and managed accordingly (Maitland,
Brazil, & James-Abra, 2012). The accumulated stress of con-
tinuously being faced with cumulative losses and difficult
dynamics can all have profound effects on professional cop-
ing abilities (Showalter, 2010; Waskiewich et al., 2012).
Without interventions aimed at the opportunity for managing
difficult emotions post death of a resident, UCPs are left
struggling in silence regarding their interpretation and/or
meaning concerning their reactions to the death of residents
(Funk, Waskiewich, & Stajduhar, 2013-2014).
Social support serves as a mediator in the grief process,
helping to alleviate the stress of grief and facilitating coping
and healing (Anderson, Ewen, & Miles, 2010). Recognizing
grief and the benefit of social support are the main goals in the
development of peer-led debriefings. Review of the literature
suggests that organizations benefit when they invest in a peer
support program. It has been reported that social support from
colleagues may mitigate the effects of a traumatic situation
more than non-work support (House, 1981; LaRocco, House,
& French, 1980). In a related study completed by Lowery and
Stokes (2005) on the effects of occupational stress injury in
paramedic students, the authors learned that students could be
protected from the detrimental impact of their duties through
a combination of receiving emotional support and being able
to discuss thoughts and feelings with a colleague who has
gone through a similar experience.
Funk et al. (2013-2014) discuss in their findings that
deaths, in particular difficult ones, can create feelings of loss,
grief, and in some cases, a sense of shock. As noted previ-
ously, the UCPs not only provide direct care, but it is also the
nature of the relationship that makes one feel as if the resi-
dent is a close friend or family member. This experience is
something that is difficult to define, yet is reported consis-
tently among UCPs in the literature (Funk et al., 2013-2014;
Waskiewich et al., 2012). Support among peers who can
instinctively draw on their own experience and solutions is
vital to an intervention intended to address disenfranchised
grief. According to Resnick and Rosenheck (2008),
"Participation in peer support enhance personal well-being"
(p. 1307). The inherent social support involved in the process
creates an environment of mutuality that supports self-care.
Peer Support Debriefing as an Intervention to
Mitigate Disenfranchised Grief
Employee's loss and grief is often overlooked and minimized
as the demands of their workplace take priority (Slawinski,
2005). In many cases, ignoring the impact of potential disen-
franchised grief can result in an emotional state of crisis for
workers. Therefore, a staff member in LTC may experience a
state of crisis as a result of a resident's death. Specifically,
when a resident dies and the staff member is not helped or
supported, it can result in an inability to function at the same
level as before the grief experience. Many theorists believe
that a crisis is respondent to the maladaptive coping skills of
an individual and lack of supports during the appraisal of a
precipitating event that leaves an individual with a lower
level of functioning after the initial event (Slawinski, 2005).
Upon review of the literature pertaining to the use and ben-
efit of peer support in other professions, it appears that peer
interaction is invaluable. Debriefings are traditionally a help-
ing response to a crisis or traumatic event, and a preventive
intervention that focuses on internal abilities and awareness
(Slawinski, 2005). Group debriefings have usually been
designed to work with groups of people to process a critical
event (Miller, 2003). In many debriefing models, the use of a
peer debriefer is seen as vital to the success of the process
(Mitchell & Everly, 1995)
Upon review of the literature, it appears that the majority of
research in the area of peer support models to mitigate occupa-
tional stress has been in the emergency services discipline.
Several studies have shown that through dialogue with col-
leagues and others, it is possible to cope with the effects of
traumaticand/ordifficultexperiences(Dyregrov,Kristoffersen,
& Gjestad, 1996; Fullerton, McCarroll, Ursano, & Wright,
1992; Jonsson & Segesten, 2003). Social support diminishes
stress and makes it understandable, thus making it possible to
cope with distressing events (Dyregrov & Mitchell, 1992;
Jonsson & Segesten, 2003). In their study with paramedics,
Alexander and Walker (1994) noted that there was a prefer-
ence for discussing incidents with colleagues. It was reported
that nearly everyone who used this method to cope with their
recent disturbing incidents found it to be helpful, and almost
half found it to be very helpful.
UCPs are often confronted with the feeling of not having
done enough, even when they have. The ability to speak with
another peer allows for a release and sharing of their loss, grief,
and the demand to continue on and care for others. Based on
this perspective, a peer debriefing intervention could assist
UCPs through their grief, and also assist in the development of
a plan to manage and support each other. Peer support pro-
grams are best delivered when they are unique and address
contextual issues such as limitations on time, social stigma and
culture, as well as support of management (Fisher et al., 2014).
Vis et al. 5
Based on the above concepts, further literature was
explored to develop and support a process that could be used
as part of a peer intervention. Pender and Prichard (2009)
indicate that the peer facilitator intervention can be used to
effectively lead a discussion among staff with the aim of nor-
malizing their responses, educate about the normal path of
the grieving process, allow time for reminiscing about the
resident, solicit coping strategies, examine what was learned
through the experience, and acknowledge the importance of
care that was provided to the resident and her or his family.
The authors present several open-ended questions, which can
establish a dynamic that invites the participants to express
their personal and professional responses to the death.
Questions such as "What was it like taking care of this
patient?" and "What have you experienced since the death?"
provide an opening for participants to discuss any physical,
emotional, behavioral, or spiritual responses.
The death of a resident in an LTC setting can often create
a sense of urgency among staff caring for residents. Peer-led
grief debriefings can be an effective intervention to assist
staff through the grieving process associated with the death
of residents, give them support, and promote self-care. In
short, the peer support debriefing process is intended to
reduce stress, collectively provide mutual support, healing,
and self-help through the process of group interaction.
Similar to Pender and Prichard (2009) and Lane (1994),
the INNPUT intervention addresses the need for normaliza-
tion of emotions, education regarding grief, opportunities to
reminisce about the resident, and discussions about coping
strategies. What is unique about the INNPUT intervention is
that it offers staff a tool to use as a guide to assist them as
they facilitate a debriefing among their peers. Although this
intervention addresses the impact of disenfranchised grief by
outwardly acknowledging the employees' loss, it is the focus
on their needs that promotes the appreciation of their experi-
ence and self-care. Whether it be discussing details about the
resident's death, what they need to do to begin closure or
what they need from each other, the attention paid to the
needs of the staff are seen as a vital intervention. Waskiewich
et al. (2012) support this process through their research, not-
ing the importance of emotional processing as it links to an
opportunity for closure following a resident's death. While it
is the relationship between the UCP and resident that creates
quality end-of-life care, it is this very relationship that must
be addressed when this relationship ends through death.
Description of INNPUT Intervention
The INNPUT intervention promotes peer group interaction
using four components identified by Lane (1994): cohesive-
ness, personal insight, support, and installation of hope.
Specifically, the intervention is designed to acknowledge the
impact of the loss for the employees; provide an opportunity
for expression of thoughts, feelings, and experiences; and cre-
ate an environment for supportive planning and promotion of
self-care, all within the context of employee partnership.
Based on the literature and research pertaining to crisis,
the grief response INNPUT intervention utilizes a peer-led
debriefing approach, designed to maximize support, self-
reflection, and self-care planning (Table 1). This interven-
tion, implemented for the first time with UCPs working in an
LTC home, was created based on information obtained
through a literature review focusing on the impact of death of
residents on front-line staff, various debriefing models, and
research results from the QPC-LTC project.
The INNPUT intervention is original and was designed to
utilize common debriefing techniques and progression cate-
gories to process issues that may emerge as a result of disen-
franchised grief. Specifically, the intervention aims to focus
on the benefit of open-ended questions and capitalize on the
benefits of a peer-led process, as noted by Pender and
Prichard (2009). The intention of the INNPUT intervention
is to capitalize on the peer-led debriefing framework as direct
care staff are instrumental in providing support to other staff
after the death of an LTC resident.
The following is a break-down of each stage, with a more
thorough description and information that might be useful to
the peer facilitator.
I--Introduction
In the beginning of the session, the facilitator of the
debriefing initiates the discussion concerning the resi-
dent's death by first acknowledging the impact the death
Table 1. INNPUT Intervention.

6 SAGE Open
may have had on the staff. This may take the form of a
general appreciation of the resident and the relationship
she or he might have had with the staff. The introduction
can also be in the form of a statement outlining why the
debriefing is being offered, and welcoming staff to partici-
pate. It is also important to use the introduction portion to
ensure that all staff have the same accurate information
surrounding the resident's death. At this time, any out-
standing questions are answered.
N--Need to Say
As a natural flow following the introduction, the facilitator
of the debriefing can move to asking employees what they
may need or want to say about the resident. It is in this sec-
tion where staff will typically like to share a special mem-
ory or event about the resident. It is likely that once one
employee begins, many others will join in, sharing details
about their relationship with the resident. When the staff
have shared what they need to say, the facilitator may wish
to summarize what was said by the group as general memo-
ries about the resident. This summary is often a natural pro-
gression to the next section regarding what the employees
need to do.
N--Need to Do
It is in this section where attention to the employee is given.
Following the summary of the memories about the resident,
the facilitator of the debriefing will then move to ask ques-
tions about what the staff might need to help them manage
through the next 24 hr. It is important to recognize that some
staff might be coming onto a shift, might be going off for the
next day or more in their shift rotation, or might be in the
middle of a shift; therefore, needs may vary. It is during this
time when staff may discuss needs related to closure, such
as going to the resident's room to say goodbye, or engaging
in some closure ritual that has been supported in the LTC
home such as placing some symbol on the resident's door or
window. Other employees may share their needs related to
self-care in the form of independent activity to remember
the resident, or the need to reach out to other staff. The
importance is on the discussion of self-care rather than the
actual activity.
P--Plan
Based on the sharing of individual needs, the facilitator of
the debriefing may then have the employees elaborate by
having them share their plan to meet their need. Again,
employees may have a plan that will include others, while
some may share plans that are more independent. It is also
beneficial for the facilitator of the debriefing to inquire
whether there is anything he or she might be able to do to
assist the co-workers in achieving their plan.
U--Understanding
The facilitator's goal throughout the exercise is to demon-
strate understanding. As a peer, the facilitator of the debrief-
ing can easily empathize with the staff's experiences, and
acknowledging their grief is vital. To this end, the debriefer
would want to use the time to summarize what staff have
shared, what they plan to do to take care of themselves, and
acknowledge their loss and grief.
T--Thank You
This part of the intervention includes an opportunity to close
the debriefing with thanking the employees for attending.
The primary function of the final component of the INNPUT
is to acknowledge the importance of staff taking time to real-
ize that they have been impacted by the resident's death. This
is also an opportunity to thank staff for their attention to self-
care, so that they can continue to provide care and support to
other residents.
The INNPUT format provides both structure and flexibil-
ity to allow for disclosure that is unique to each group's
experience. This intervention can be easily adapted to fit
within any LTC environment, and addresses the main initia-
tives needed to attend to staff's burden of grief. The peer-led
approach also acknowledges the perspective that UCPs are in
the best position to identify the support and resources their
peers may need to manage their loss and grief. As this inter-
vention is intended for LTC home use, it also demonstrates
that support through grief and in the work environment is a
vital component of a holistic and inclusive palliative care
program in LTC setting.
Implementation of INNPUT
Intervention
By 2013, the INNPUT intervention was developed and ready
to be introduced in the field. Before the intervention was
implemented in the LTC homes, educational training ses-
sions were held for staff who would act as facilitators of the
debriefing and use the INNPUT. Two training sessions
occurred at Lakehead University, with each session having a
pre- and post-evaluation done by the researchers to refine the
training and develop a toolkit for use in other LTC homes. A
total of 23 staff volunteered to participate in the peer-led
debriefing training sessions. Recruitment criteria for poten-
tial facilitators of the debriefing included the following:
expressed interest in facilitating a peer-led debriefing, ability
to personally relate to the impact of disenfranchised grief, is
comfortable being in a leadership role, respected and trusted
among their peers, and currently not in a supervisory role (to
promote a safe environment). Disciplines who participated in
the training were UCPs (22) and recreation therapy/life
enrichment aids (1). A strong focus was on engaging direct
care staff in becoming peer-led facilitators of the debriefing
Vis et al. 7
because they provide the majority of resident care and are
likely to be affected by the death of the residents.
Training content included information about disenfran-
chised grief, trauma, compassion, fatigue, and the need for
debriefing and incorporating ritual strategies in the work-
place. Participants were introduced to the INNPUT interven-
tion. Two mock debriefing sessions were held in a simulation
lab with a high fidelity mannequin for participants to practice
their debriefing skills. Participant evaluations indicated that
mock debriefing training methods were perceived to be
effective. As a result of this feedback, no further changes to
the intervention were made.
After the staff training was complete, the INNPUT
intervention was introduced and implemented in two LTC
facilities that were part of the QPC-LTC Alliance. Staff
were encouraged to conduct debriefing sessions as soon as
possible after each resident's death, taking into account the
priority of care demands for residents and family mem-
bers, immediately following a resident's death. The trained
facilitator of the debriefing who was working at the time of
the death invited interested staff to attend the debriefing,
and decided on the best time to hold the session. Staff
attendance at the debriefings was voluntary with most
choosing to attend. Ground rules for the debriefing
included no one is forced to talk, front-line staff are encour-
aged to participate from start to finish, everyone is treated
equally, there are no right or wrong answers, no interrup-
tions are permitted (e.g., cell phones), difference in opin-
ions are expected and valued, discussion is guided by the
INNPUT intervention, and the session takes place in a
small group or sharing circle.
Assessment of Perceived Benefits of INNPUT
Intervention
One of the researchers was "on call" to observe the debrief-
ings for several months, attending six sessions in total.
Implementation assessment data included qualitative ques-
tionnaires completed by six UCP peer debriefers, informal
interviews with 73 LTC staff participants, and a review of a
researcher's field notes after observing six debriefings. The
researcher's role within the debriefing sessions was primar-
ily to observe and act as a support if needed, and to document
the experience of the UCPs implementing the INNPUT inter-
vention using field notes.
The audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim
by the research assistant who participated in the education,
in the interventions, gathered field notes, and conducted
the interviews of the UCP debriefers. The analysis went
through a three-level process of analytic induction.
Saturation occurred when commonalities arouse from the-
matic analysis of the data. This approach, called thematic
analysis, identified, analyzed, and narrated themes
extracted from the data (Vaismoradi, Turunen, & Bondas,
2013).
UCP Experience of Intervention
Thematic analysis of the data identified two main themes.
First, staff felt that the INNPUT intervention supported their
self-care. As discussed in the literature regarding disenfran-
chised grief, staff rarely were able to engage in sharing their
loss and grief (Boerner et al., 2015; Funk et al., 2013-2014).
According to field notes, staff felt that having the debriefings
allowed them to say goodbye and to have a closure.
And finally just some acknowledgment that we do have some
grief, and it is like we are making closure for her, because our
life here it just continues, one dies and another one come, so we
just continue and learn by ourselves. (UCP)
The peers who facilitated the debriefings felt very strongly
that all staff benefitted every time a debriefing session was
done.
So I think with time we were prepping ourselves to say the final
goodbyes and having this, this communication and getting
together and sharing all the stories, I feel good about it, I think
this is great and that you guys are here. (UCP)
The second theme was acknowledgment. Staff felt that
the INNPUT intervention provided them with an opportunity
to openly acknowledge and process their grief. In addition,
the management supported the INNPUT intervention. As a
result, organizational support, along with team interaction
within the INNPUT intervention, provided a unique opportu-
nity to promote individual well-being and organizational cul-
ture change.
Interestingly, upon review of the field notes between June
and November 2013, there appeared a remarkable transfor-
mation regarding UCP's opinion regarding the potential of
the INNPUT intervention. Not all UCPs were convinced that
the INNPUT intervention would provide a positive outcome;
however, after experiencing the debriefings, numerous staff
commented on how astonished they were about the experi-
ence. Staff noted that they shared and learned more about
their grief, as well as how to care for themselves and others.
Many were surprised that the intervention created a sense of
team support.
Upon review of field notes, staff typically implemented
the INNPUT debriefing intervention to meet their specific
needs. During debriefings, staff regularly discussed the resi-
dent who had died, their memories of the resident, self-care,
and anything they felt could have been done better to provide
a good death for the resident. They met in a quiet room for
about 20 min, usually either before or after their shift, with
management support. It was conveyed to the researcher that
having management support for debriefings aided the griev-
ing process by acknowledging and validating their loss.
The researcher noted that between 10 and 12 staff on
average participated in these sessions, with many of them
expressing that the debriefing represented a closure for them.
8 SAGE Open
They felt it was a safe place to share their feelings with peo-
ple who could relate to their loss and grief. Staff who attended
the debriefings included UCPs, nurses, life enrichment, and
dietary staff. One of the UCP, who has been working in LTC
for more than 10 years, was asked what the peer debriefings
meant to her. She offered the following reflection on her
experience with the researcher:
Residents become like family to us. For some staff, the honor of
being with resident when they took their last breath, or holding
someone's hand until their soul leaves their body, this can stay
with you for a long time . . . residents become like family to
staff. When they die, another is placed in that bed and we start
over. In the past, we just accepted the death and continued on
quietly remembering them . . . we needed a way to lessen the
burden of grief...staff volunteered their time to be trained in
peer led debriefings . . . this is a way to come together and grieve
in a safe environment. Staff from every department gather and
say what they need to in order to have a closure with a death.
Some staff want to be in the room to hear stories and be a part of
the ritual. Being with co-workers, listening to stories is a
wonderful way to say goodbye and to make room for new
residents in our hearts . . . I found that doing and taking part in
the debriefings have helped staff to be able to move on quicker,
feel good about the work that was done to make this person
special, and know their final time with us was a good memory.
During debriefings there is laughter, some tears, and some talk
about regrets, but we come to terms with things we cannot
change nor have control of. At the end of our debriefing, we
put the resident's name and the date of death on a leaf. We
place the leaf on a tree branch in our home. This way we may
come to the tree, look at all the leaves and remember the funny
stories, the lessons learned, the gratitude we have for knowing
these wonderful human beings. Peer led debriefings is like the
period at the end of a sentence. You have to have it or the grief
just goes on. (UCP)
Two years later (December 2015), the staff working in
these LTC homes continue to conduct debriefings.
Implementing this protocol is sustainable because it addresses
an expressed need by the staff and requires minimal invest-
ment of organizational resources. Over time, however, it will
be necessary to train more peer facilitators.
Conclusion
The peer-led debriefing INNPUT intervention offers a facili-
tated process that helps prevent disenfranchised grief through
validation. Ultimately, the message is received that employ-
ees have lost a person whom they cared for intimately.
Osterlind et al. argue that death and dying in LTC homes is
common, yet it evokes fear and avoidance of staff. Death is
surrounded by silence, and emotions are pushed into the
background (Osterlind et al., 2011).
The INNPUT intervention can be easily adopted by any
LTC home and championed by direct care staff. It requires
minimal organizational resources to implement and sustain.
Through the implementation of this intervention, it is
believed that the opportunity for human relatedness and
shared experience will lessen the isolated feelings that may
lead to disenfranchised grief in LTC.
The lack of research on grief experienced by health care
providers in LTC homes is noteworthy. The INNPUT inter-
vention was developed based on auxiliary research. Peer-led
debriefing in LTC is in its infancy and warrants further
research. Although the long-term benefit of this intervention
has not been vigorously evaluated, it is existing in practice
with positive results. Further research will need to be con-
ducted to fully support its efficacy.
