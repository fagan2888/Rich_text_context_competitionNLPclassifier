Introduction
In progressive renal diseases, including gentamicin (GM)-
induced nephropathy, renal inflammation is a vital patho-
logic process in the evolution of chronic kidney disease;
this inflammation is characterized by the infiltration of
inflammatory cells such as monocytes/macrophages and
myofibroblasts.1,2 Infiltrating macrophages in the renal
tubular interstitium can release proinflammatory chemoat-
tractive cytokines, thereby leading to the formation of a
vicious self-accumulation cycle. Furthermore, infiltrating
macrophages can produce profibrotic cytokines such as
transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, which plays a cru-
cial role in progressive renal fibrosis.3,4
Multiple signaling pathways are thought to mediate
these inflammatory and fibrotic processes in progressive
renal diseases. One of these pathways, the nuclear factor
B (NF-B) pathway, is known to regulate the expression
of numerous genes involved in inflammation and cell pro-
liferation. Thus, it is thought to be a key transcription factor
that can mediate acute and chronic inflammation by regu-
lating the gene expression of cytokines, chemokines and
adhesion molecules and consequently cause apoptosis and
interstitial fibrosis in progressive renal disease.5,6
Additionally, in vitro studies have suggested that activa-
tion of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
pathway also plays a critical role in the proliferation of
tubular epithelial and myofibroblast-like cells.7 Mitogen-
activated protein kinases (MAPKs) use three parallel signal

Abstract
This study aimed to examine the protective effects of aliskiren on gentamicin-induced nephropathy. Rats were injected
with gentamicin (100 mg/kg per day) for 14 days. Aliskiren was infused for two weeks. Human proximal tubular epi-
thelial cell lines (HK-2) were cultured with gentamicin in the absence or presence of aliskiren. Inflammatory profibrotic
and apoptotic markers were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Aliskiren treatment attenuated the decreased creatinine
clearance, increased fractional sodium excretion, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and counteracted the
increased ED-1 expression in gentamicin-treated rats. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-)
and adhesion molecules (MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) increased in the gentamicin-treated kidneys. These changes
were restored by aliskiren co-treatment. Aliskiren effectively reversed transforming growth factor--induced fibrotic
responses such as induction of -smooth muscle actin in gentamicin-treated rat kidneys. Along with these changes, aliski-
ren also attenuated the increase in nuclear factor B and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK 1/2)
levels in HK-2 cells cultured with gentamicin. In addition, aliskiren decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and
reduced the expression of proapoptotic markers in gentamicin-treated HK-2 cells. These findings suggest that aliskiren
attenuates gentamicin-induced nephropathy by suppression of inflammatory, profibrotic and apoptotic factors through
inhibition of the nuclear factor B, Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.

transduction pathways. Cell proliferation is triggered via
transient ERK activation and differentiation is triggered via
sustained ERK activation; however, the exact role of the
ERK signaling pathway in progressive renal disease
remains to be determined. GM also directly activates apop-
totic genes and increases apoptosis in tubular and intersti-
tial cells, resulting in tubular atrophy.8
The autocrine and paracrine activities of the tissue
renin­angiotensin system (RAS) are important modulators
of the structure and function of a number of organs and
systems, including the heart, kidneys, vasculature and skel-
etal muscle.9 Aliskiren, a low molecular weight, nonpep-
tide, direct renin inhibitor (DRI), which has demonstrated
targeted organ protection in various animal models,10,11 is
now available for treating human hypertension.12 However,
it is not known whether aliskiren treatment in GM-induced
nephropathy leads to organ protection.
In this study, we investigated the effects of aliskiren on
GM-induced nephropathy; to elucidate its mechanism of
action, we examined the effect of aliskiren on renal inflam-
mation, fibrosis and apoptosis after GM-induced renal
injury.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male Sprague­Dawley rats weighing 180­200 g were
used. The experimental procedure conformed to the
Institutional Guidelines for Experimental Animal Care and
Use. The rats were treated with GM (100 mg/kg per day,
intramuscularly (IM)) alone, GM with aliskiren (Novartis,
USA, 25 mg/kg per day) using osmotic minipumps (mod-
els 2002, Alzet, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or vehicle for 14
days. The rats were maintained individually in the meta-
bolic cages for the last three days to allow urine collections
for the measurement of Na+ and creatinine. On the day of
the experiment, under anesthesia with isoflurane, blood
samples were collected from the inferior vena cava and
analyzed for Na+ and creatinine. The right kidney was rap-
idly removed and processed for immunoblotting as
described below. The left kidney was fixed via retrograde
perfusion for immunohistochemistry.
In another set of experiments, the rats were decapitated
under a conscious state and the kidneys were removed and
kept at -70°C until assayed for mRNA expression by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR).
Measurement of GM concentration in whole
kidney
GM was extracted from renal tissues by using a sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) extraction method. Briefly, 300 l of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to the tube, and
the contents were homogenized. The homogenizer was
rinsed with another 300 l of PBS, which was pooled with
the original homogenate. An equal volume of 2M NaOH
was added to the homogenate, and the mixture was incu-
bated at 70°C for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged at
13,000 g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and
neutralized to pH 7.0 before GM concentration was meas-
ured. GM concentrations were determined using a fluores-
cence polarization immunoassay.13,14
Cell culture and application of GM and
aliskiren to HK-2 cells
An immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from
HK-2 was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured. Briefly,
cells were passaged every 3­4 days in 100-mm dishes
(Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA) using Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium-F12 (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA), insulin-trans-
ferrin-sodium selenite media supplement (Sigma Chemical
Co., St Louis, MO, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/
ml streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO,
USA). These cells were incubated in a humidified atmos-
phere of 5% CO2
, 95% air at 37ºC for 24 h and subcultured
at 70­80% confluence. For experimental use, HK-2 cells
were plated onto 60-mm dishes in medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum for 24 h and cells were then switched to
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 with 2% fetal
bovine serum for 16 h. These cells were treated with GM
(0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of aliskiren
(50 and 100 nmol). Control cells received buffer only
instead of GM or aliskiren. The cells were harvested at the
end of the treatment for further analysis.
Semiquantitative immunoblotting
The dissected kidney was homogenized in ice-cold
isolation solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 25 mM
imidazole, 1 mM EDTA, 8.5 µM leupeptin, 1 mM phe-
nylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. The homogenates
were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove
whole cells, nuclei and mitochondria. The total protein
concentration was measured (Pierce BCA protein assay
reagent kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). All samples
were adjusted with isolation solution to reach the same
final protein concentrations and solubilized at 65°C for
15 min in SDS-containing sample buffer and then stored
at ­20°C. To confirm equal loading of protein, an initial
gel was stained with Coomassie blue. Sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed
on 9 or 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were
transferred by gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Mini Protean
II, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) onto nitrocellulose
350 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
membranes (Hybond ECL RPN3032D, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). The blots were
blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (80 mM Na2
HPO4
, 20
mM NaH2
PO4
, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, pH
7.5) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibodies, followed by incubation with second-
ary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or anti-goat horseradish per-
oxidase-conjugated antibodies. The labeling was
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
system.
Immunohistochemistry
A perfusion needle was inserted in the abdominal aorta
and the vena cava was cut to establish an outlet. Blood
was flushed from the kidney with cold PBS (pH 7.4) for
15 s before switching to cold 3% paraformaldehyde in
PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 min. The kidney was removed and
sectioned into 2­3 mm transverse sections and immer-
sion fixed for 1 h, followed by 3 × 10 min washes in PBS.
The tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and
left overnight in xylene. After embedding in paraffin, 2
µm sections were made on a rotary microtome.
Immunoperoxidase labeling was performed as previously
described.15
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-
time PCR)
Renal cortex was homogenized in Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was extracted
with chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, washed
with 75% ethanol and then dissolved in distilled water.
The RNA concentration was determined by the absorb-
ance read at 260 nm (Ultraspec 2000; Pharmacia
Biotech, Cambridge, UK). The mRNA expression of
inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules was
determined by real-time PCR. cDNA was made by
reverse transcribing 5 g of total RNA using oligo(dT)
priming and superscript reverse transcriptase II
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was quantified
using Smart Cycler II System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) and SYBR Green was used for detection. Each
PCR reaction was done in 10 M forward primer, 10 M
reverse primer, 2X SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara
Bio Inc., Japan), 0.5 l cDNA and H2
O to bring the final
volume to 20 l. Relative levels of mRNA were deter-
mined by real-time PCR, using a Rotor-GeneTM 3000
Detector System (Corbette Research, Mortlake, New
South Wales, Australia). Sequences of primers are listed
in Table 1.
The PCR was performed according to the following
steps: 1) 95°C for 5 min; 2) 95°C for 20 s; 3) 58­62°C
for 20 s (optimized for each primer pair); 4) 72°C for 30
s; and 5) 85°C for 6 s to detect SYBR Green. Steps 2­5
were repeated for additional 64 cycles, while at the end
of the last cycle temperature was increased from 60°C to
95°C to produce a melt curve. Data from the reaction
were collected and analyzed with the Corbett Research
Software. The comparative critical threshold (Ct) values
from quadruplicate measurements were used to calculate
the gene expression, with normalization to GAPDH as
an internal control.16 Melting curve analysis was per-
formed to enhance specificity of the amplification
reaction.
Pathologic examinations
The extent of glomerulosclerosis (GS) was graded from 0
to 4 by a semiquantitative score: 0: normal; 1: mesangial

erate GS (25 to 50%); 3: severe GS (50 to 75%); and 4:
diffuse GS involving >75% of the glomerular tuft. The
glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) for each rat was calcu-
lated as a mean value of all glomerular scores obtained.17
Tubulointerstitial lesion indexes were determined using a
semiquantitative scoring system.17 Ten fields per kidney
were examined, and lesions were graded from 0 to 3 (0:
no change; 1: changes affecting <25% of the section; 2:
changes affecting 25 to 50% of the section; and 3: changes
affecting 50 to 100% of the section) according to the area
with tubulointerstitial lesions (tubular atrophy, casts,
interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis). The score index
in each rat was expressed as a mean value of all scores
obtained.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-
mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assay
The ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (Oncor,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was used. The sections were
dewaxed and treated with proteinase K, then incubated
with equilibration buffer for 10 min, followed by incuba-
tion with working-strength TdT enzyme solution at 37°C
for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by incubation in
working-strength stop/wash buffer for 30 min at 37°C.
Sections were then incubated with antidigoxigenin peroxi-
dase and then incubated with diaminobenzidine and 0.01%
H2

for 5 min at room temperature. The sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light
microscopy.18

aliskiren was not attributed to the competitive inhibition
of GM accumulation in the kidney. The protein expres-
sion of the renin receptor was not changed by GM or
aliskiren co-treatment in GM-treated rats compared with
control rats (Figure 1).
Effects of aliskiren on pathological changes
in GM-induced renal injury
Figure 2 shows the morphological changes observed in the
kidneys among the three groups of animals. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining indicated the presence of tubular casts,
obstructions and vessel dilatations in the rats with
GM-induced renal injury. The GSI was higher in the rats
with GM-induced renal injury than in the control rats; treat-
ment with aliskiren was associated with a less pronounced
increase in GSI. In addition, interstitial expansion was also
a prominent component of the renal injuries in the rats with
GM-induced renal injury, which was attenuated by aliskiren
treatment.
Effects of aliskiren on inflammatory cell
infiltration in GM-induced renal injury
For determining the effects of aliskiren on renal inflamma-
tory cell infiltration, the protein expression of ED-1 and
iNOS and the infiltration of ED-1-positive macrophages in
renal tissue were analyzed (Figure 3). The protein expres-
sion of ED-1 and iNOS in the kidney was significantly
higher in GM-treated rats than in the controls and was ame-
liorated by aliskiren treatment (Figure 3(a)). The infiltra-
tion of ED-1-positive macrophages in GM-treated rats was
significantly higher than that in the control rats. Aliskiren
co-treatment abrogated inflammatory cell infiltration in
GM-treated kidneys (Figure 3(b)).
Effects of aliskiren on the expression of
inflammatory cytokines and adhesion
molecules in GM-induced renal injury
We also investigated the expression of TNF-, IL-1 and
IFN-, which are key inflammatory cytokines that are pro-
duced by infiltrating cells. As shown in Figure 4, GM treat-
ment significantly induced renal TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-
mRNA expression, while these changes were attenuated
with aliskiren co-treatment.
Increased expression of certain chemokines and adhe-
sion molecules such as MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1,
which can activate, recruit or induce the transmigration of
inflammatory cells into the site of renal injury, was also
seen. The expression of these factors was induced by GM
treatment. Aliskiren co-treatment significantly reduced the
expression of these chemokines in the GM-treated rat kid-
neys (Figure 4).
Effects of aliskiren on NF-B expression in
GM-induced renal injury

incubated with GM (1.0 mg/ml). Expression of the p65
NF-B subunit increased at 1 h after GM exposure. NF-B
expression was also determined in HK-2 cells that were
pretreated with aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol) for 3 h after
GM (1.0 mg/ml) exposure for 6 h. Expression of the p65
NF-B subunit was higher with GM than in the control,
while the increase induced by GM was attenuated with
aliskiren pretreatment.
Effects of aliskiren on pERK 1/2 expression
in GM-induced renal injury
When HK-2 cells were incubated with GM (1.0 mg/ml),
pERK 1/2 antibody binding increased 30 min after GM
exposure and remained high over time (data not shown).
pERK and pP38 expression was also determined in HK-2
cells pretreated with aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol) at 2 h
before GM administration. In this experiment, pERK and
pP38 overexpression induced by GM was significantly
repressed by aliskiren (100 nmol) pretreatment. pJNK
expression did not change on treatment with GM or
aliskiren (Figure 6).
Effects of aliskiren onTGF-1 and Smad
expression in GM-induced renal injury
Semiquantitative immunoblotting showed that the
expression of TGF-1, an important profibrotic molecule
derived from infiltrating inflammatory cells, significantly
increased in GM-treated rats and was markedly

attenuated by aliskiren treatment. We also assessed the
TGF-1-triggered Smad signaling pathway by evaluating
the total Smad-2/3 and Smad-4 levels and the level of
inhibitory Smad-6. An increase in the total Smad-2/3
level in GM-treated rats was accompanied by an increase
in Smad-4 content and a decrease in the inhibitory
Smad-6 content compared with those in the control group.
These GM-induced changes were again restored by
aliskiren co-treatment (Figure 7).
Effects of aliskiren on renal fibrosis in GM-
induced renal injury
We next examined the expression of fibronectin and
-smooth muscle actin (-SMA), the molecular marker
of myofibroblasts. Figure 8 shows that GM treatment
significantly increased the protein expression of fibronectin
and -SMA. These changes were ameliorated by aliskiren
treatment (Figure 8(a)). In vitro studies showed that
aliskiren pretreatment also reduced fibronectin expression
induced by GM (Figure 8(b)).
Effects of aliskiren on renal tubular cell
apoptosis in GM-induced renal injury
GM treatment increased the expression of the proapoptotic
marker Bax and decreased that of the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2, resulting in an overall increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.
Aliskiren treatment attenuated the increase in the Bax/Bcl-2
ratio in GM-treated rats (Figure 9(a)). To determine the pro-
tective effects of aliskiren on GM-induced renal tubular
apoptosis, we performed TUNEL. The number of tubular

epithelial cells containing TUNEL-positive nuclei increased
in GM-treated rat kidneys; aliskiren co-treatment attenuated
this effect (Figure 9(b)). Furthermore, the Bax and cleaved
caspase-3 levels increased in GM-pretreated HK-2 cells,
which was also attenuated by aliskiren treatment (Figure 10).
Discussion
In the present study, aliskiren treatment did not change
the GM concentration and renin receptor expression in
the kidney. This finding suggests that the effect of
aliskiren was attributed neither to the competitive inhibi-
tion of GM accumulation in the kidney nor to the down-
regulation of renin receptor expression. It has been
reported that there was no difference between the affin-
ity of angiotensin II for its receptor between glomeruli
from controls and those from rats treated with GM.19
These findings do not support the role of angiotensin II
in the development and maintenance of GM-induced
renal injury. Therefore, the renoprotective effects of
aliskiren might be pleiotropic.
A decline in renal function in chronic kidney disease
often correlates with the extent of inflammation.20 GM,
in particular, can accumulate in the renal cortex, pro-
moting the interstitial proliferation of fibroblast cells
and focal infiltration by inflammatory cells.21 In this
study, GM-treated rats showed a marked increase in
monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the renal cortex/
medulla, as indicated by the large number of ED-1-
positive cells in the interstitium. These findings are
consistent with previous observations demonstrating
that GM can cause an increase in monocyte/macrophage

adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 were also evaluated. Aliskiren co-treatment suppressed the overexpression of these inflammatory
cytokines and adhesion molecules induced by gentamicin (GM).

populations in the kidney.22 GM increased the expres-
sion of proinflammatory markers such as TNF-, IL-1
and IFN-. These inflammatory molecules participate
in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial impairment via
the promotion of leukocyte attraction and adhesion to
inflamed renal tubular cells. The expression of cell sur-
face adhesion molecules such as MCP-1, ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1, which are highly specific chemotactic fac-
tors for macrophages, increased in the kidneys of
GM-treated rats. These findings also indicate that the
inflammatory process plays a significant role in the
pathogenesis of GM-induced renal injury. Furthermore,
we showed that aliskiren significantly reduced the
infiltration of ED-1-expressing macrophages in the kid-
ney and decreased the GM-induced renal expression of
proinflammatory cytokines and cell surface adhesion
molecules. These findings suggest that aliskiren can
attenuate the kidney damage by suppression of cell sur-
face adhesion molecules as well as inflammatory
cytokines.
NF-B is thought to be a key transcription factor that
underlies the renal inflammatory process by regulating
the gene expression of cytokines, chemokines and adhe-
sion molecules in progressive renal diseases. In the GM
rat model, NF-B was activated by GM administration,
and blockade of NF-B activation reduced apoptosis and
interstitial fibrosis.23 NF-B is released from an inhibi-
tory subunit I-B and translocates into the nucleus, where
it promotes the transcriptional activation of target genes.6
In our study, the expression of nuclear p65 subunits of
NF-B increased after GM treatment in HK-2 cells,
which suggests that GM induced NF-B activation and
translocation via I-B degradation. A recent study also
suggested that aliskiren can repress NF-B expression in
diabetic rats.24
Multiple possible intracellular mechanisms are known
to regulate inflammation and fibrosis cascades in dis-
eased kidneys. TGF-ß1 is a key molecule in these pro-
cesses, and a comprehensive survey indicates that in
tubular epithelial cells it is capable of activating several
signal transduction pathways such as those involving
MAPKs.25 MAPKs are fundamental regulators of most
immune cell functions, including proliferation, differen-
tiation, survival and apoptosis, chemoattraction and
inflammatory mediator production. They use three paral-
lel signal transduction pathways, that is, those involving
ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38. One of these
pathways, the ERK signaling pathway, has been shown to
be activated by TGF-ß in mesangial cells.26 TGF-ß
increases ERK activity and fibronectin expression in rat
mesangial cells.27 In addition, specific inhibition of ERK
prevented TGF-ß-induced fibronectin expression. These
results indicate that the ERK pathway may play an impor-
tant role in TGF-ß-mediated fibrosis. Other researchers
have suggested that activation of the ERK pathway also
plays a critical role in the proliferation of tubular epithe-
lial and myofibroblast-like cells.7 We also observed that
ERK 1/2 activation was induced within several hours of
GM administration to HK-2 cells, and this increase was
attenuated by aliskiren. These changes coincide with the
initiation of the fibrotic process, which has been shown to
include overexpression of fibronectin and -SMA in vivo
and in vitro.
TGF-ß1 signals are transduced by transmembrane ser-
ine/threonine kinase type I and type II receptors and
intracellular mediators known as Smads. On TGF-ß1
stimulation, receptor-bound Smad proteins such as Smad-
2/3 are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation induces the
association of Smad-2/3 with Smad-4, a member of the
co-Smad subfamily, and they form transcriptionally
active complexes that translocate into the nucleus and
activate the transcription of TGF-ß-induced target genes.
Smad signaling can also be negatively controlled by the
inhibitory Smad-6 and Smad-7 proteins. Therefore, TGF-
ß1-induced fibrosis is thought to be mediated by Smad
signaling.4 In our study, GM induced the overexpression
of Smad-2/3 and Smad-4, whereas inhibitory Smad-6
Figure 5. The expression of the p65 subunit of nuclear
factor B (NF-B) and cytosol IB was assessed in
HK-2 cells incubated with gentamicin (GM) (1.0 mg/ml) by
semiquantitative immunoblotting. The nuclear p65 subunit
expression was analyzed in HK-2 cells incubated with GM
(1.0 mg/ml) for 6 h in the absence and presence of aliskiren.
Aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol/l) was used to pretreat HK-2 cells
3 h before GM exposure. The GM-induced overexpression
of the nuclear p65 subunit of NF-B was ameliorated with
aliskiren (100 nmol/l) pretreatment.

expression decreased in response to GM. ERK and PI3K
signaling may be involved in GM-induced reactive oxy-
gen species generation and subsequent renal cell dam-
age.28 We showed that aliskiren reduced ERK 1/2 and p38
activation in GM-treated rat kidneys. These changes
coincided with the in vivo and in vitro expression of renal
fibrosis markers such as fibronectin and -SMA.
Therefore, the ERK 1/2 and p38 signaling pathways acti-
vated by TGF-ß1 appear to mediate GM-induced renal
fibrosis, which is effectively inhibited by aliskiren.
Masson's trichrome staining confirmed aliskiren-induced
attenuation of collagen deposition and fibrosis in
GM-induced nephropathy.
In progressive renal disease, tubular cell apoptosis
precedes the manifestations of tubular atrophy, tubular
dilatation and perivascular inflammation.4 GM induces
Bax aggregation and translocation to the mitochondria,
causing activation of caspase-9, which then cleaves and
activates the effector caspase, caspase-3, leading to a
loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and to
apoptotic cell death.29 In this study, the number of
TUNEL-positive cells increased after GM treatment.
Figure 6. Mitogen-activated protein kinase expression was also analyzed in HK-2 cells incubated with gentamicin (GM) (1.0 mg/
ml) for 3 h in the absence and presence of aliskiren. Aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol/l) was pretreated in HK-2 cells 2 h before GM
exposure. Note the significantly decreased pERK 1/2 and p38 expression in the GM with aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol/l) groups
compared with that for the GM group.

Along with these changes, GM increased the expression
of the Bax protein and cleaved caspase-3, whereas it
downregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic pro-
tein Bcl-2. These changes were reversed by aliskiren.
Several reports have implicated MAPK pathways in
apoptotic signaling by TGF-ß. For example, activation
of TGF-ß-activated kinase-1 (TAK-1), a protein of the
MAP kinase family, activates p38 and JNK signaling in
TGF-ß-family-induced apoptosis,30 and p38 signaling is
required for TGF-ß-induced apoptosis in murine podo-
cytes.31 Inhibition of TGF-ß1 and MAPK expression by
aliskiren suggests that aliskiren prevents apoptosis and
tubular atrophy through the inhibition of TGF- ß1
expression.

proteins. TGF-ß1 expression increased significantly in the kidneys of gentamicin (GM)-treated rats, and was markedly attenuated
by aliskiren co-treatment. Consistent with the changes in TGF-ß1, increases in Smad-2/3 and Smad-4 protein expression suggest
that TGF-ß1 triggered the Smad signaling cascade. The expression of inhibitory Smad-6 was lower in GM-treated rats than in the
control group. These GM-induced changes were inhibited by aliskiren co-treatment. Magnification: ×200.

Figure 10. Effects of aliskiren on the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic markers. Semiquantitative immunoblotting indicated
that the level of the proapoptotic marker Bax increased in gentamicin (GM)-treated HK-2 cells. Significant increases in cleaved
caspase-3 expression were noted in GM-treated cells. Aliskiren also attenuated all of these changes.
*p < 0.05 compared with the control.

In conclusion, the renin inhibitor aliskiren exerts anti-
inflammatory effects through the inhibition of NF-B, result-
ing in reduction in TGF-ß1 expression and TGF-ß1-induced
Smad-2/3 and MAPK signaling in GM-induced nephrotox-
icity. This inhibition of TGF-ß1 signaling also attenuates
GM-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis and fibrosis.
