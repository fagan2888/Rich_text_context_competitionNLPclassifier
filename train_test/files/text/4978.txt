Abstract: Individual differences in proneness towards granting benefits (i.e., helping) or
imposing costs (i.e., hindering) may have led to processes that detect and remember people
who are prone to help or hinder. We examined two factors that might influence such
memory: the intentionality of the acts and individual differences in psychopathy
characteristics. Participants viewed several videos of computer-animated agents that helped
or hindered another agent, either intentionally or unintentionally. Afterward, participants
had better memory for agents that acted intentionally. Additionally, participants with more
psychopathic tendencies had enhanced memory for helpers, suggesting that certain
individual characteristics might result in heightened memory for people who are prone to
granting benefits.
Keywords: helper recognition, hinderer recognition, behavioral intent, psychopathy.

Introduction
The human brain appears to be prepared to detect and evaluate helpers and
hinderers at a very early age. Before 12 months of age, infants attribute a valence to actions
such that enabling an agent to achieve its goal is seen to be similar to other positive actions
(e.g., caressing), while thwarting an agent's progress is grouped with negative actions
(Premack and Premack, 1997). Infants at this age also prefer agents who have been
observed to help another individual over those who have purposefully hindered progress
(and, indeed, actively avoid the latter), even when the agents themselves are little more
than simple objects (e.g., a triangle or square) animated by puppeteers (Hamlin, Wynn, and
Bloom, 2007). Moreover, infants appear to recognize that other individuals--those who
Remembering helpers and hinderers

have been helped or hindered--will prefer those who have aided them in the past
(Kuhlmeier, Wynn, and Bloom, 2003).
Thus, before we can engage in effective helping or hindering behavior due to
motoric and other maturational constraints, humans show sophisticated interpretation of
these behaviors. In the present study, we examine whether, by adulthood, our human
cognitive systems for evaluating and detecting helping and hindering actions also promote
enhanced memory for the agents involved. That is, while memory for individuals is
fundamental for social competence, might individuals who engage in helping or hindering
behavior be better remembered?
When approaching this question, we can consider the predictions of social contract
theory (SCT; e.g., Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). SCT argues that human cognitive
architecture is designed to detect cheaters, or those who "defect" by taking a benefit
without fulfilling their end of a social contract. That is, cheaters cheat by not reciprocating.
In fact, it is argued that this cheater detection system is necessary for cooperation to be an
evolutionarily stable strategy because it allows for conditional helping (e.g., Cosmides and
Tooby, 1989). More recently, some investigations of the social contract theory have moved
from cheater detection to the hypothesis that people should be good at remembering and
recognizing cheaters.
Cheater recognition research, however, has remained equivocal. In Mealey, Daood,
and Krage (1996), participants had greater memory for the faces of cheaters than faces of
trustworthy people. One study has since replicated this effect (Chiappe et al., 2004);
however, the degree to which cheaters had cheated appeared to be greater than the degree
to which cooperators had cooperated (Barclay and Lalumière, 2006). Additionally, Oda
(1997) has also replicated Mealey et al.'s (1996) effect, but only when cheaters were male,
not when they were female. Because social contract theory cannot explain these sex
differences, results cannot be used to support the theory (Mehl and Buchner, 2008). Other
studies have outright failed to replicate Mealey et al.'s findings (see Barclay, 2008, for
review); Barclay and Lalumière (2006), for example, controlled for description intensity
and added "altruists" in addition to cheaters, trustworthy, and neutral characters, and found
no difference in memory across each of these categories.
In response to these findings, more recent research has proposed that instances of
seemingly enhanced cheater recognition in some studies may be the result of assumptions
regarding the low probability of such individuals in one's environment, coupled with
memory systems biased to encode rarity (Barclay, 2008). Indeed, people may do best to
remember both cooperators and cheaters, as the former would also support preferential
interaction with those who will provide benefits (Brown and Moore, 2000).
The present study examines the related question of how adults encode the agents
involved in simple helping and hindering behavior (e.g., enabling goals or thwarting them).
Here, SCT and accompanying "cheater recognition" proposals do not directly apply; it is
unclear whether helping and hindering fit into the theory as originally construed as there is
no explicit social contract information provided and the events provide no detail regarding
the benefits to being a helper or hinderer (only, potentially, benefits to the agent who is
helped). One possibility is if people who cheat in social contracts are also those who
impulsively impose costs to others (as we might expect among psychopaths, for example),
then enhanced ability to remember hinderers, particularly when the behavior is intentional,
may have also been adaptive.

Psychopathy and memory for helpers and hinderers
Barclay and Lalumière (2006) have presented an intriguing hypothesis about
individual difference characteristics that might enhance the ability to remember cheaters or
altruists. They tested whether university students who scored higher on a measure of
psychopathy (i.e., people with a personality oriented towards cheating) remembered the
faces of cheaters better because they are sensitive to the underlying motives or whether
they remember altruists better because altruists are exploitable; however, they found no
such relationships in one experiment, and slight enhancement in memory of altruists in a
second experiment. We therefore also wondered if psychopaths, who not only exploit
others for personal benefits (i.e., without contributing to the social contract) but also
impose costs (consider their crime versatility, impulsivity, irresponsibility, callousness, and
poor behavioral control), are either more prone to remembering hinderers because they are
sensitive to psychopathic motives, or are more prone to remember helpers because they are
easier to exploit.
Although Barclay and Lalumière's process of transforming psychopathy into a
categorical variable reduces statistical power to detect significant effects and increases the
chances of a Type II error (Streiner, 2002), reanalysis of their data yielded the same null
results (Barclay, personal communication, November 28, 2009). For comparative purposes,
we were interested in using both Barclay and Lalumière's data analytic strategy and also
the preferred approach that uses psychopathy in its original continuous form. Also of
concern was the use of the Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale (CAT-SR; Harris et al.,
1994; Seto, Khattar, Lalumière, and Quinsey, 1997) to evaluate psychopathy and its fusion
with the Levenson Psychopathy Scale (LPS; Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick, 1995) to
create a composite measure of psychopathy. Although CAT-SR correlates with measures of
psychopathy (e.g., Harris, Rice, and Quinsey, 1994), its psychometric properties have yet to
be thoroughly investigated. The LPS, on the other hand, has been evaluated for its internal
consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity (reviewed in Lilienfeld and Fowler,
2006). Indeed, Barclay found slightly different correlations with memory for cheaters when
reanalyzing the data separately for LPS and CAT-SR (personal communication, November
28, 2009), though such differences did not change the interpretation of their results.
Intentionality and memory for helpers and hinderers
The characterization of others' actions as intentional or unintentional plays an
important role for subsequent behavior evaluation and prediction (e.g., Knobe, 2003). For
example, adults assign more blame or praise to intentional actions compared to
unintentional actions (e.g., Ohtsubo, 2007) and are more likely to retaliate or reciprocate
when harmful or helpful actions are intentional (e.g., Swap, 1991). Even children as young
as three years of age allocate more responsibility for actions that are considered intentional
(e.g., Nunez and Harris, 1998), and toddlers younger than 2 years consider an individual's
previous intention to provide a desired object when determining whether to help her
(Dunfield and Kuhlmeier, 2010).
Previous research has found no difference in memory for agents involved in
intentional versus accidental actions unrelated to helping and hindering (e.g., a man
purposefully popping a balloon or a man unintentionally dropping a pen; Fausey and
Boroditsky, in prep.). Here, however, we examine whether memory for helpers or hinderers
is affected by whether the agents have intentionally or accidentally engaged in the
Remembering helpers and hinderers

behavior. It is possible, for example, that intentional helping and hindering actions may be
different from other types of actions such that encoding of the agents involved is enhanced.
Present study
The purpose of the present study was to test two factors that might influence
memory for individuals whose actions either aid (i.e., helpers) or harm (i.e., hinderers)
another. In the first set of analyses, we tested whether memory for helpers or hinderers, or
both, is enhanced when their actions are intentional, as opposed to unintentional. In the
second set of analyses, we tested whether memory for either of these types of agents was
enhanced among people with psychopathic traits using alternative statistical methods to
increase power.
Given concerns raised regarding the stimuli used in previous studies (Barclay and
Lalumière, 2006; Mehl and Buchner, 2008), we aimed to improve on procedures by
keeping all events similar and removing verbal aspects. We took advantage of unique
scenarios that have previously been used in studies with infants (e.g., Hamlin et al., 2007;
Kuhlmeier et al., 2003). These movie stimuli consist of simple shapes ("agents") that
engage in helping or hindering another shape in its quest to climb a hill. In this way, we
equate the length of time to observe the events and the general movement patterns of the
actions, as well as strip away any facial/emotional elements of the scenarios.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Eighty undergraduate students (age range: 17 to 21 years; M = 18.34, SD = 0.75),
recruited from the undergraduate subject pool, participated in this study. Of these
participants, 19 (24%) were men and 61 (76%) were women. All received class credit for
their participation.
Materials
The Levenson Psychopathy Scale (LPS) (Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick, 1995) is
a 26-item self-report questionnaire used to assess participants' antisocial attitudes and
behaviors. Its contents are similar to the clinical assessment of psychopathy (Psychopathy
Checklist-Revised; Hare, 1991), and it is appropriate to use with university students. Each
item is scored from 1 (disagree strongly) to 4 (agree strongly). Higher scores indicate a
higher number of psychopathic tendencies. LPS scores for the sample ranged from 34.00 to
73.00 (M = 50.63, SD = 8.00).
The Childhood and Adolescent Taxon Scale (CAT-SR) is an 8-item, self-report
questionnaire that measures early behavioral problems associated with adult psychopathy
(Harris et al., 1994; Seto, Khattar, Lalumière, and Quinsey, 1997). Each item is scored as 0
(absent), 1 (some indication), or 2 (present); all 8 items are averaged for an overall score.
CAT-SR scores of the sample ranged from 0.00 to 1.00 (M = 0.11, SD = 0.22).
Stimuli and Procedure. Videos were created using computer-animation software
(Maya Unlimited 6.5, Alias Systems Corporation, 2005). These videos were presented to
participants on a 61 cm computer monitor via MediaLab presentation software. Participants
sat approximately 50 cm away from the computer, facing the monitor. Each participant was
randomly assigned into one of two conditions, Intentional or Unintentional.
Remembering helpers and hinderers

During the familiarization phase, participants in the Intentional condition were
shown four Intentional Help movies and four Intentional Hinder movies (Figure 1), and
participants in the Unintentional condition were shown four Unintentional Help movies and
four Unintentional Hinder movies (Figure 2)1
The Help and Hinder movies in both conditions began with a red ball climbing the
first of two hills. After it reached the top of this small hill, it stopped and expanded and
contracted (as if excited) before continuing up the next, bigger hill. However, it had
difficulty climbing this hill and thus, when halfway up it slid back down to the base. The
ball tried to climb this hill again but as before, had difficulty and started to slide back
down. At this moment, the events differed depending on the behavior type (help vs. hinder)
and condition (intentional vs. unintentional).
, in pseudorandom order. All movies, based
on earlier infant work (e.g., Kuhlmeier, Wynn, and Bloom, 2003; Premack and Premack,
1997), were 8 seconds long and set on a white background. The animated agents in the
events were a triangle (varying in color with each video) and a red dome-shaped object
(hereafter, "ball"). In each condition (Intentional and Unintentional), half of the participants
observed one set of colors for the triangles, and the other half saw a different set of colors.
A black screen was interspersed between each familiarization video.
In the Intentional Help video, a triangle moved down from its location at the top of
the screen and helped the ball by pushing it up the bigger hill. When the ball reached the
top of this hill, it expanded and contracted. In the Intentional Hinder video, a triangle
moved down from its location at the top of the screen and hindered the ball by pushing it
down the bigger hill. Due to momentum of the push, the ball slid all the way down to the
base of the first hill.
In the Unintentional Help video, the stand on which the triangle was sitting tipped,
causing it to bounce off a hexagon-shaped barrier and accidentally hit the ball from behind,
in turn helping it up the hill. When the ball reached the top of this hill, it expanded and
contracted. In the Unintentional Hinder video, the stand on which the triangle was sitting
tipped, this time causing it to bounce off the barrier and accidentally hit the ball in the
front, thus hindering it from going up the hill. Due to the momentum of the push, the ball
slid all the way down to the base of the first hill.
The four movies were equated on various parameters. The length of each movie was
8 seconds. Contact between the triangle and the ball occurred at the same frame across all
movies, and duration of contact time was identical. Further, the amount and duration of
motion of the triangle was the same in all events.
Following these movies and completion of the LPS and CAT-SR, the memory test
screens showed 16 triangles (8 previously-viewed colors, 8 new colors; Table 1) in random
order, one at a time. A recognition question for the color of the triangle was presented ("Do
you remember this shape from the previous videos?"), and participants had the choice of
selecting `Yes' or `No'. Memory was measured by calculating the number of correct
triangles remembered, with higher scores indicating better memory.
1 Early pilot testing was undertaken to ensure that the movies indeed were seen to depict intentional and
unintentional helping and hindering events. Ten out of 10 adult viewers watched the events and provided
written descriptions that fit this interpretation (e.g., the intentional triangles were said to "want to push the
ball" while the unintentional triangles were described as "slipping" or "falling").

Psychopathy Score Data Management. We first replicated Barclay and Lalumière's
procedure for calculating psychopathy scores by standardizing LPS and CAT-SR within
each sex, taking the averages, and then trichotomizing scores within each sex. To ensure
results were not due to combining these measures (since psychometric properties of this
combined measure have not been evaluated, and the psychometrics of CAT-SR is limited)
or due to a lack of power when categorizing a continuous variable, we tested whether
psychopathy was related to memory for helpers or hinderers using the original scales and
the continuous version of psychopathy with correlation and regression methods.
Results
Memory for actors: Intentional versus unintentional actions
A mixed-model analysis of variance was conducted to investigate whether memory
for the triangle actors varied with intentionality (between: intentional vs. unintentional),
behavior type (within: help vs. hinder), or an interaction between them. Intentionality had a
significant main effect on the number of triangles remembered, F (1, 78) = 6.34, p = .014,
partial 2 = .075 (Figure 3). Memory in the intentional condition (M = 5.97, SD = 1.22) was
significantly better than that of the participants in the unintentional condition (M = 5.20, SD
= 1.52). However, we found no significant main effect of behavior type, F (1, 78) = 0.951,
p = .33, partial 2 = .012; hinderers were not remembered any better than helpers or vice
Remembering helpers and hinderers

versa (Figure 4). The interaction between intentionality and behavior type was also not
significant, F (1, 78) = 1.35, p = .25, partial 2 = .017.2 Therefore, the effect of
intentionality on the number of triangles remembered does not depend on the actions that
the triangles are engaged in. Additionally, although intentionality influenced memory,
participants in both intentional, t (38) = 10.07, p < .001, and unintentional conditions, t (40)
= 5.03, p < .001, remembered triangles greater than chance.

Psychopathy scores and memory for actors
As expected from previous research, men (n = 19, M = 54.74, SD = 8.61) and
women (n = 61, M = 49.34, SD = 7.41) differed on LPS, t (78) = 2.66, p = .009, and men (n
= 19, M = 0.23, SD = 0.32) and women (n = 61, M = 0.08, SD = 0.16) differed on CAT-SR,
t (78) = 2.85, p = .006. Because of these sex differences, all subsequent analyses used
standardized scores of psychopathy within each sex.
Using a 2 x 3 x 2 mixed model ANOVA on memory scores (between: psychopathy
and sex; within: behavior type), we found no main effect for psychopathy, F (2, 74) = 2.35,
p = .10, behavior type, F (1, 74) = 1.31, p = .26, or sex, F (1, 74) = .26, p = .61, and none of
the interactions were significant, ps > .31. With the exception of sex, our results replicated
Barclay and Lalumière's findings.
To ensure these null findings were not due to a lack of power from categorizing
psychopathy (see Streiner, 2002), we used multivariate regression to test for a linear
relationship between psychopathy and memory for helpers and hinderers. Though
psychopathy did not predict a linear combination of memory for helpers and hinderers, F
(2, 77) = 1.96, p = .15, nor memory for hinderers alone, F (1, 78) = .89, p = .35, the
prediction of memory for helpers approached significance, F (1, 78) = 3.58, p = .06.
Because the psychometric properties of a composite psychopathy measure are
unknown, and because CAT-SR and LPS were not correlated among women3
Discussion
, we reran the
multivariate regression using LPS and CAT-SR as independent predictors. CAT-SR did not
predict a linear combination of memory for helpers and hinderers, F (2, 76) = .131, p = .88,
nor did it predict memory for helpers, F (2, 76) = 0.13, p = .88. Interestingly, the
relationship between LPS and a combination of helpers and hinderers approached
significance, F (2, 76) = 3.02, p = .06. Further examination found a significant relationship
between LPS and memory for helpers, F (1, 77) = 4.46, p = .04, but not for hinderers, F (1,
77) = 2.54, p = .12. Similarly, Pearson correlation coefficients found a significant
relationship between LPS and memory for helpers, r (78) = .25, p = .03, and no relationship
between LPS and memory for hinderers, r (78) = .17, p = .13. Using Fisher's r-to-z
transformation, however, we found that these correlations were not significantly different, z
= -0.53, p = .59 (two-tailed).
Across our sample, we found no evidence for a difference in memory for agents
who previously helped and agents who previously hindered a third party, consistent with a
growing body of research suggesting that enhanced memory for either cheaters or hinderers
over altruists or helpers (or vice versa), if existent, is subtle (e.g., Barclay and Lalumière,
2006; Mehl and Buchner, 2008). However, the novel procedures of the present study
allowed us to explore factors that may influence encoding and memory for helpers and
hinderers: the intention of the action and individual differences in psychopathy
characteristics. Each will be discussed in turn.
3 This was found in the present study and that of Barclay and Lalumière (2006).
Remembering helpers and hinderers
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8. 2010. -313-
The intentionality of helping and hindering actions affected later memory of the
agents (i.e., the triangles). Although in both the Intentional and Unintentional conditions
the goal of the third party (i.e., the ball) was ultimately aided or thwarted, memory for the
helpers and hinderers was enhanced when their actions were intentional. Remembering
people who intentionally help or harm others may be adaptive because their actions reflect
true goals and allow predictions of future actions (Malle and Knobe, 1997). Indeed, an
important consideration is that this effect is not confounded with other factors (e.g., the
goal of the ball and its final end states remain consistent, all physical features of the
characters remain identical, the duration of contact between characters is equal), and the
only difference between the movies in the two conditions was the intention of the agents to
help or hinder.
We may also consider the processes that drove the enhanced recognition of the
intentional helpers and hinderers. Our preferred interpretation is that participants encoded
and remembered these agents more because they were intentional helpers and hinderers, yet
alternatively it is possible that enhanced memory was observed because these were
intentional objects acting volitionally on the screen that simply engendered more interest,
regardless of their actions. To be clear, it is unlikely that participants in the Unintentional
condition simply did not pay enough attention to the unintentional agents as memory for
these agents was also above chance level. Additionally, recent research has found no
difference in memory for human actors involved in intentional versus accidental actions
unrelated to helping and hindering (Fausey and Boroditsky, in prep.), suggesting that our
results may be specific to these particular intentional behaviors. Further, under the
alternative explanation, one would not predict individual differences in memory for helpers
or hinderers in the present study, an effect found when individual tendencies in terms of
psychopathy were considered.
It is possible, though, that neutral, yet intentional, actions would also lead to
enhanced memory of agents when compared to the Unintentional condition. This is an
empirical question4
When using the LPS, a self-report psychopathy measure with known psychometric
properties (Lilienfeld and Fowler, 2006), in its continuous form, we found that psychopathy
was related to memory for helpers, not hinderers. Psychopaths are social predators who
manipulate and exploit others without regret for any harm that may have been caused, and
may therefore be predisposed to attend to and remember people who are exploitable.
People who help, cooperate, and are altruistic are more exploitable than people who do not
have these characteristics. Whether this trait represents an adaptive psychological module
, yet there is good reason to think that it is, in fact, the act of
intentionally helping and hindering that is leading to improved memory for the agents in
this paradigm. For example, Hamlin and colleagues (Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom, 2007)
found that infants under one year of age engaged in social evaluation of agents who
intentionally helped or hindered but not intentional agents who engaged in neutrally
valenced actions. This suggests that even at this early age, helpers and hinderers are being
encoded in a manner strong enough to allow for subsequent adaptive behavior (e.g.,
showing a preference for a helper).
4
The animated events in the present procedure do not allow for compelling presentation of actions that are
perceived as truly neutral in relation to the hill-climber if other parameters are to be kept identical among
conditions.
Remembering helpers and hinderers

for remembering helpers as part of an obligate life-history strategy specific to psychopaths
remains to be tested, especially because Barclay and Lalumière did not find a relationship
between psychopathy and memory for altruists. Our failure to find a relationship between
psychopathy and memory appeared to be driven by categorizing a continuous measure of
psychopathy and using an unvalidated composite measure of psychopathy. This procedure,
however, does not account for the differences between our study and Barclay and
Lalumière's study. One possible explanation for these differences is that viewing
behavioral cues in our study could be more salient and ecologically valid than reading
scripted cues.
A limitation in our study, and in all relevant studies that use self-report measures of
psychopathy, is that few, if any, participants were true psychopaths. A more direct way to
test the hypothesis for enhanced memory of altruists among psychopaths while overcoming
setbacks of these self-report measures is to assess a forensic sample using the clinical
measure of psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (Hare, 2003). If the helper
and/or hinderer detection among psychopaths hypothesis is true, we expect larger and more
robust effects in studies that includes clinical psychopaths. Until such studies are
conducted, we remain cautious in interpreting the effects of psychopathy on memory for
helpers.
In sum, individual differences in proneness towards granting benefits or imposing
costs may have led to cognitive processes that allow enhanced encoding of individuals who
intentionally help and hinder. Indeed, differential memory for hinderers over helpers, or
vice versa, may not be a robust general effect across samples. Instead, certain individual
characteristics might result in heightened memory for one over the other.
