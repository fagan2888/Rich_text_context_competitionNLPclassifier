Introduction
Education is a powerful means to reduce poverty and achieve
economic growth (Breton, 2004; Mankiw, Romer, & Weil,
1992). It empowers people, improves individuals' earning
potential, promotes a healthy population, is a major determi-
nant of democracy, and builds a competitive economy
(Castelló-Climent, 2008; Hannum & Buchmann, 2005;
Hanushek & Wössmann, 2007; United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2015; The
World Bank, 2006). Since the start of the Education for All
(EFA) campaign after the World Education Forum in Jomtien
in 1990, remarkable progress has been made in getting young
children in developing countries into primary education.
However, still millions of children drop out of school at too
young an age, shifting the problem from getting children into
school to keeping them there. In many countries in South and
West Asia and sub-Sahara Africa, one in every four children
who start school drops out before completion (UNESCO,
2015). Children who leave school before they have finished
the curriculum do not develop their potential to the fullest,
and their countries waste scarce resources sorely needed. It is
therefore of prime importance to get a better understanding
of the factors that drive the decision to drop out of school in
developing countries.
Most research on dropout has been conducted in the United
States and other highly developed countries. About the situa-
tion in less developed countries, much less is known. This is a
pity because, as Buchmann and Hannum (2001) already noted,
improving our understanding of the determinants of educa-
tional participation in developing countries might provide us
with new insights into the roots of educational stratification
beyond what we already know from Western countries. For
example, there is evidence that in poorer countries school char-
acteristics are more important for educational achievement
than in richer countries (Fuller & Clarke, 1994; Heyneman &
Loxley, 1983), and that in sub-Sahara African countries grow-
ing up in a single mother family is less detrimental (and some-
times even beneficial) for children's education than in more

Keeping Children in School: Effects of
Household and Context Characteristics
on School Dropout in 363 Districts of 30
Developing Countries
Janine Huisman1 and Jeroen Smits2
Abstract
We study household and context determinants of school dropout using data for 130,000 children in 363 regions of 30
developing countries using multi-level discrete-time event-history analysis. Most (72%) of the variation in school dropout is
due to household-level factors, with socioeconomic resources (parental education, father's occupation, and wealth) being
most important. Household structure plays a role too. Earlier born, non-biological children and children living with one
parent drop out more. Important context factors are educational resources (availability of schools and teachers) and level
of development of the region. Interaction analysis reveals that many effects of household-level factors depend on context
characteristics, stressing the importance of a situation-specific approach. Results also indicate that the transition from primary
to secondary education is a major breaking point in children's educational careers and that extending the duration of primary
education might be an effective strategy to keep children in school longer.

developed regions (Bammeke, 2008; Lloyd & Blanc, 1996;
Pellenberg, Smits, & Huisman, 2014).
In this article, we aim to contribute to the literature on
school dropout in developing countries by answering the fol-
lowing research questions:
Research Question 1: Which household, district, and
national factors influence the decision to stay in school?
Research Question 2: How are the direct effects of these
factors moderated by characteristics of the context in
which the children live?
To address these questions, we use a comprehensive theo-
retical framework derived from literature that structures the
many factors that influence the decision to drop out of school
(cf. Spierings, Smits, & Verloo, 2010; Webbink, Smits, & de
Jong, 2013). This framework distinguishes between three
conditions that affect this decision (resources, structure, and
culture), which manifest themselves differently at the differ-
ent levels of analysis (household, district, national). With
respect to these conditions, we test three hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: Children from households and contexts
with more resources are more likely to stay in school.
Hypothesis 2: Children from households and contexts
with a structure in which it is easier for children to benefit
from education are more likely to stay in school.
Hypothesis 3: Children from a culture in which education
is valued more are more likely to stay in school.
Besides hypotheses related to our framework, we test an
additional hypothesis which is especially relevant from a
policy perspective. Given that there are indications that chil-
dren are more likely to drop out of school right after finishing
a specific level, we formulate and test the primary duration
hypothesis, which assumes that parents are more likely to
pull their children out of school after completion of the pri-
mary level. If this hypothesis holds, increasing the duration
of primary education might be an effective strategy to keep
children longer in school in countries with high dropout rates
at young ages.
Besides predicting direct effects, our theoretical frame-
work allows for indirect effects in the form of interactions
between the different risk factors for dropout. This increases
the possibilities to study determinants in their specific con-
text (Spierings etal., 2010). This "role of the context" is par-
ticularly important from a policy perspective, as problems
with respect to school dropout are often concentrated within
specific groups and regions and may require situation-
specific information to be addressed.
To answer our research questions and test our hypotheses,
we will apply a multi-level discrete-time event-history anal-
ysis on data for 130,000 children, living in the first years of
the 21th century in 363 districts1 in 30 developing countries.
This analysis improves earlier research in three important
ways. First, we study effects of risk factors at the household
and at the context level simultaneously, providing better esti-
mates of the relative importance of the separate risk factors.
Second, with context data on 363 districts, our explanatory
power for studying context effects is much larger than that in
earlier studies using only context information at the national
level. Third, we enriched our database with information from
administrative sources about the availability and quality of
educational facilities in the regions where the children live.
This makes a detailed analysis of the role of supply-side fac-
tors possible.
Theoretical Framework
To obtain a thorough understanding of the roots of school
dropout, we have to analyze the effects of all relevant factors
at the various levels simultaneously. To make such an analy-
sis possible, we have built an extensive theoretical frame-
work for understanding school dropout, taking models for
labor participation of women and children as a starting point.
Following Spierings etal. (2010), our framework is built on
the following four ideas: (a) the context in which children
live can be divided into different levels (household, commu-
nity, national); (b) decisions regarding educational participa-
tion and school dropout are made at the household level, by
parents, caretakers, and/or other family members, including
the child itself; (c) different factors at the different levels
influence these decisions simultaneously; and (d) the strength
of these influences may differ between contexts.
Our framework is presented in Figure 1. At the center is
the decision to drop out of school or not. Because we focus
on school dropout rates, we restrict our analysis to children
who are or have been in school at the time of research. The
decision to drop out of school is dependent on the relative
value that parents, caretakers of the child, and possibly the
child itself ascribe to educational attainment versus its alter-
natives, that is, helping at home and/or earning additional
income for the household. The factors which influence drop-
ping out are shown in ovals. These factors are located within
concentric circles that indicate the level at which the factors
act, that is, household, district, and national. The lower-level
factors are embedded within and affected by the higher-level
factors (cf. Spierings etal., 2010).
The determining factors are further conceptualized as
being part of three conditions that should be met for children
to enter and stay in school regarding resources, structure, and
culture (Webbink etal., 2013). Decisions regarding school-
ing of children depend first of all on the availability of suf-
ficient resources at household and context level such as
household wealth, parental education, and quality and quan-
tity of local educational facilities. Furthermore, even if the
necessary resources are available, structural factors influ-
ence whether (continuing) schooling is considered the best
option for this particular child. For instance, the household
might have too many children to send all of them to school,
Huisman and Smits 3
or one of the parents might no longer be part of the house-
hold, so that it is considered better to let one or more children
leave school to help out in the household. The labor market
structure might also be important for the decision to continue
schooling. If people with a higher education earn substan-
tially more, parents may decide to let their children stay lon-
ger in school. Local norms and values, that is, culture, might
be important too. This might influence the degree to which
people value education relative to other options. Especially
for girls, cultural barriers might prove an important force in
reducing the time they spend in school. In the next section,
these conditions will be discussed in more detail.
Resources
The household needs to have enough of the right resources to
be able to send children to school. There is broad evidence
that children from families with more socioeconomic
resources are more likely to stay in school (Coleman etal.,
1966; Evangelista de Carvalho Filho, 2008; Jencks, 1972;
Mingat, 2007; Shavit & Blossfeld, 1993). For wealthier
households, direct costs, such as fees, books, and uniforms,
and opportunity costs, such as forgone earnings from child
labor, are likely to be less important (Basu, 1999). Also chil-
dren of better educated parents more often go to school and
stay in school (Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997; Ersado, 2005;
Huisman & Smits, 2009; Shavit & Blossfeld, 1993;
UNESCO, 2015). Parents who have reached a higher level of
education might be better able to help their children succeed
in school. For educational enrollment of girls, having a
mother with a higher level of education might be especially
important (Emerson & Portela Souza, 2007; Fuller, Singer,
& Keiley, 1995; Shu, 2004). Parents in salaried employment,
especially in a non-manual occupation, might want their
children to obtain a similar kind of employment and might be
more willing to invest time and energy in their children's
education (Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997). Self-employed par-
ents, such as (small) farmers, are more likely to expect their

older children to drop out to help in the family business as
Nicaise, Tonguthai, and Fripont (2000) found for Thailand
and Tansel (2002) found for Turkey. Children of a working
mother might be taken out of school after receiving some
education to help out in the household.
Both availability and quality of educational facilities are
important for educational participation, especially of specific
groups, like the poor and girls (Buchmann & Hannum, 2001;
Ersado, 2005; Handa, 2002; Hou, 2010; Huisman & Smits,
2009). If there are fewer schools available, average distance
to school will be longer, which might negatively affect the
likelihood to stay in school (Colclough, Rose, & Tembon,
2000; Mingat, 2007; Tansel, 2002). The effect of distance is
more likely to be severe for girls, partly due to parents' con-
cern for their daughters' safety, which could become more of
a hurdle once girls reach puberty. Bad school quality has
been found to have a negative effect on the decision to stay
in school, the so-called push-out effect (Bergmann, 1996;
Brown & Park, 2002; Fuller et
al., 1995; Punch, 2004).
According to Bergmann (1996), school quality is a gradient
running parallel to job opportunities, "peaking in the capital,
declining through other urban areas and reaching its minima
in remote rural areas" (p. 601). Dropout, therefore, may be
highest in the rural areas. Presence of female teachers will be
especially important for girls (Colclough etal., 2000; Dee,
2005; Hou, 2010; Huisman & Smits, 2009). Male teachers
might not provide girls with enough support, or might even
be sexually threatening to them, leading to higher dropout of
female pupils. The first hypothesis we will test in this article
is therefore on resources. This resource hypothesis predicts
that children from households and contexts with more
resources available for schooling are less likely to drop out
of school.
Structure
The structure of the household determines the degree of dilu-
tion of the available resources and consequently the degree
to which each child can actually benefit from these resources.
The number of siblings has been found to be negatively cor-
related to educational enrollment both in the United States
(Blake, 1989) and in some developing countries (e.g.,
Knodel, Havanon, & Sittitrai, 1990 for Thailand and Pong,
1997 for Malaysia). This might be because people with more
children can devote less time and resources to each individ-
ual child (Downey, 1995). However, more children might
also mean more helping hands at home, which increases the
chance that at least some children stay in school, as has been
found for Botswana (Chernichovski, 1985). The same effect
might be found in extended households, where relatives, par-
ticularly grandparents, may help out or contribute to the
household income, making it easier for children to stay in
school. Birth order has also been found to be important.
Younger children in large families are more likely to stay in
school (Buchmann & Hannum, 2001; Emerson & Portela
Souza, 2002), because the older children do the household
chores or contribute to the household income by earning
some extra money (Estudillo, Sawada, & Otsuka, 2009).
Girls, especially oldest daughters, have been found to suffer
most (Chu, Xie, & Yu, 2007; Ota & Moffatt, 2007). In
Western countries and many developing countries, single
parenthood has a negative effect on educational attainment
(Seltzer, 1994). A possible reason being that single parents
have less time and attention to devote to their children.
However, in some African countries, female-headed house-
holds are associated with greater educational opportunities,
probably due to a higher propensity among women than
among men to invest in children's education in situations of
restricted resources (Bammeke, 2008; Lloyd & Blanc, 1996).
Parents are also expected to favor their own children in stay-
ing in school over adopted or foster children (Fafchamps &
Wahba, 2006).
When considering the necessity of continuing education
beyond a basic level, parents and children might estimate
future employment prospects by looking at the current local
labor market structure (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Children are
less likely to pursue further education if job opportunities for
people with few qualifications are good, like in districts
where agriculture is a major sector (Buchmann & Brakewood,
2000; Huisman & Smits, 2009; Tansel, 2002), and more
likely to stay in school if formal job opportunities for which
secondary education is required are realistic. If it is easier for
men than for women to find a (well-paid) job, parents may
also take their child's sex into account (Colclough et
al.,
2000; Song, Appleton, & Knight, 2006).
The second hypothesis we will test in this article is there-
fore on structure. This structure hypothesis predicts that in
households and contexts where the structure is such that chil-
dren can benefit more from the available socioeconomic and
educational resources and from going to school, children are
less likely to drop out of school.
Culture
The local culture influences whether education is valued in
general. In more modern areas, there is generally more
impact of globalization, including value patterns that stress
the importance of education and equality among the sexes. In
urban areas, the state influence is stronger and there might be
more pressure on parents and children to stay in school than
in rural areas (Fafchamps & Wahba, 2006; Tansel, 2002).
Culture also influences whether education is valued more for
some children than for others. In more patriarchal cultures,
investments in girl's education are expected to be lower, as
women are supposed to remain in the private domain and not to
engage in paid employment (Gündüz-Hosgör & Smits, 2008;
Smits & Huisman, 2013). Parents might also be more moti-
vated to invest in their son's education in cultures where sons
are expected to look after their parents in old age (Colclough
etal., 2000). Rankin and Aytaç (2006), for instance, found for
Huisman and Smits 5
Turkey that girls from patriarchal families are more likely to
drop out. The third hypothesis we will test in this article is
therefore on culture. This culture hypothesis predicts that if
the local culture is such that education is valued more rela-
tive to other options, children are less likely to drop out of
school.
Besides this rather generic hypothesis on the role of cul-
ture, we will test a more specific one based on existing norms
regarding school duration. There are indications that govern-
ments can use such norms to increase the age at which chil-
dren leave school. If the local norm is that children leave
school after completing primary education, increasing the
duration of primary education might be an effective way to
keep children longer in school (Aydagul, 2008; Hossain &
Jahan, 2000; Smits & Gündüz-Hosgör, 2006). Consequently,
our fourth hypothesis, the primary duration hypothesis, is
that children are more likely to drop out after finishing a spe-
cific level. The Turkish government, for instance, in 1997,
extended the legal duration of primary education to 8 years
(Aydagul, 2008; Karakasoglu, 2007). Since that time, the
average number of years of schooling in Turkey has increased
considerably. However, because the extension was accompa-
nied by other measures aimed at increasing participation, we
do not know to what extent the increase was due to the longer
legal duration of primary education. In this article, we test
this hypothesis in two ways. First, we test whether children
have a higher propensity to drop out directly after complet-
ing primary education. Second, we test whether countries
with longer legal duration of primary education have lower
dropout rates in the higher age groups.
The Role of the Circumstances
The fourth pillar of our theoretical model is the supposition
that the strength of the effect of the factors in our model may
vary among contexts, or, in other words, the causes of school
dropout may differ depending on the circumstances. For this
reason, standard solutions often do not work and policy mea-
sures aimed at improving attainment should be as specific as
possible. In this article, this specificity is achieved by incor-
porating interactions in our models. By studying how the
effects of the risk factors discussed differ according to charac-
teristics of the context in which the household lives, we can
make our model and predictions more situation-specific.
Regarding the effect of the context in which a child lives
on the chances of staying in school, we expect that favorable
household conditions, that is, more resources (in terms of
wealth and education or work status of the parents) or a more
favorable household structure, will compensate children for
disadvantageous living conditions. When there are few
schools available, parents with more resources or motivation
might be better able to get and keep their children in school
(Filmer & Pritchett, 1999; Handa, 2002; Mugisha, 2006).
These parents might, for example, arrange transportation
when traveling distances are longer. Huisman and Smits
(2009) found distance to school to be less important for chil-
dren from fathers with a non-farm job and working mothers.
When schooling is of low quality, higher educated parents
may be better able to help their children with their home-
work, or, because they know the school culture, strike the
right note with the head master in case of problems. Wealthier
parents might hire a tutor. Children from extended house-
holds might have grandparents or other relatives who can
help with homework or accompany children to school.
Interactions might also give us an indication about the
validity of the hypothesis of Heyneman and Loxley (1983).
This hypothesis predicts that under the more difficult cir-
cumstances found in developing countries, school charac-
teristics would be more important relative to family
background characteristics in explaining educational out-
comes of children. This hypothesis has since then been
tested in many empirical studies (e.g., Baker, Goesling, &
Letendre, 2002; Fuller, 1987; Fuller & Clarke, 1994; Huang,
2010), but the findings are mixed and no definitive conclu-
sion has been drawn. In the context of our study, it would
imply that in regions with a lower level of development the
(positive) effects of a better educational infrastructure are
stronger than the (positive) effect of a more favorable family
background.
Data and Method
Data
We use data derived from the Database Developing World, a
data infrastructure in which household-level datasets from
various sources are harmonized, connected, and supple-
mented with context data (www.datdevworld.org). The data
used for this article are from Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) and the Pan Arab Project for Family Health
(PAPFAM) of the League of Arab States. We used data for
the 30 countries (26 DHS and 4 PAPFAM) for which also
information on educational facilities at the district level was
available.
Our combined dataset contains information on 134,608
children and their households (65,098 girls and 69,510 boys)
aged 12 to 15. For 7 countries (Bolivia, Colombia, India,
Indonesia, Malawi, Peru, Philippines), a random sample of
households was taken because the datasets were dispropor-
tionately big. The household-level information of the chil-
dren was supplemented with context information for the 363
districts and 30 countries in which the children live. District-
level information was partly obtained by aggregating from
the household surveys. This was possible because the sur-
veys involve large samples and have a variable indicating the
district in which children live. Information on educational
facilities at the district level was derived from administrative
sources. Detailed information on the data, including the
source and year of the surveys and the administrative data,
can be found in the appendix.

Method
The effects of the family background, district and national-
level factors on staying in school are studied using multi-
level discrete-time hazard models (Omariba & Boyle, 2007;
Yamaguchi, 1991). These models deal correctly with right-
censoring while taking the clustering of households within
districts and countries into account (Snijders & Bosker,
1999). The district and country differences in educational
dropout are dealt with by estimating random intercepts at the
district and national level. This can be represented by a
model with a binary response y

represent the ran-
dom differentials from the overall mean at the district and the
country levels. In all analyses, robust standard errors (sand-
wich estimators) are used.
The children included in our analyses were aged 12 to 15
at the time of the interview and had completed at least one
grade. The upper age limit was put at 15 because we only
have parental information for children who still live with
their parents. Each child was represented in the data by one
or more child-grade records or spells. Children are repre-
sented up to the year of survey or the grade they dropped out.
For example, a child who dropped out after completing
Grade 5 is represented 5 times in the database. The child-
grade records were constructed on the basis of the informa-
tion on the number of grades the children had completed at
the time of the interview. The total number of child-grade
records was 688,716.
The age of the children in a specific grade is not exactly
known, because we do not know at which age they started
primary education or whether they repeated or skipped
grades. However, we know exactly how many grades of
every level the children had completed at the time of the
interview. Our outcomes, therefore, give a better picture of
school dropout in a given grade than at a given age.
To test whether the effects of the explanatory variables dif-
fer between boys and girls, we computed interactions between
all variables and sex. If the interaction was significant, sepa-
rate coefficients for boys and girls were estimated. To make
our findings more situation-specific, we also estimated mod-
els with interactions among various relevant context factors
(educational facilities, urbanization, level of development)
and between these factors and the household-level variables.
To compute the interaction terms, centered versions of the
involved variables are used. The main effects therefore can
be interpreted as average effects. Given the large number of
possible interactions, only significant interaction effects are
included in our final models.
Variables
Household-Level Variables
Father's occupation is measured as (1) farm, (2) lower non-
farm (manual, sales, and service jobs), and (3) upper non-
farm (professional, managerial, technical, and clerical).
Employment of the mother is measured by a dummy indicat-
ing whether (1) or not (0) she was gainfully employed.
Father's education is measured with three categories: (1)
none, (2) at least some primary, and (3) at least some second-
ary. Given the very low levels of education of most mothers
in the countries under study, their education is measured with
a dummy indicating whether (1) or not (0) she has at least
some primary education.
Household wealth is used as a proxy for income and is
measured by an index constructed on the basis of household
assets and housing characteristics. Using a method devel-
oped by Filmer and Pritchett (1999), all households within a
country are ranked based on the available assets and divided
into wealth deciles. For living in a rural area, a dummy is
used indicating whether (1) or not (0) the area where the
household lived was defined "rural" in the surveys.
Presence of parents is measured with two dummies indi-
cating whether (1) or not (0) the mother or father is missing
from the household. Extended household structure is mea-
sured with three categories: (0) nuclear family, (1) more than
two adults in the household but no grandparents, (2) more
than two adults in the household, including grandparents.
Whether the child is a biological child is measured by a
dummy, with (0) for foster, adopted, or unrelated children
and (1) for biological children. Birth order and number of
sisters and brothers are measured with interval variables. Sex
of the child is measured as (0) for boys and (1) for girls. To
get a rough indication of the strength of a woman's position
within the household, we included a dummy showing
whether (1) or not (0) the mother had her first child below
age 18. To test whether dropout is higher directly after com-
pleting primary education, we included a dummy indicating
whether (1) or not (0) the previous grade was the highest
grade of primary education in the national educational
system.
Children with a missing parent were given the mean score
of the other children in the database on the variables indicat-
ing characteristics of the parents. Because there are dummies
for missing mother or father in the model, this procedure
leads to unbiased estimates of these variables (Allison, 2001).
For children with mothers younger than 16 or older than 49,
information on occupation of the father, employment of the
Huisman and Smits 7
mother, and the age at which the mother had her first child
was not available in the DHS. To be able to include those
children in the analyses, we gave them on these variables the
average of the children for whom information was available,
and we included a dummy indicating whether (1) or not (0)
the respective variable was missing from the database. To
find out whether the coefficients of the other variables were
biased by this procedure, two robustness tests were per-
formed. First, the models were reestimated after (separately)
removing the variables for father's occupation, mother's
employment, and age at which the mother had her first child.
Second, the models were reestimated after removing the
children with missings on these variables. Both tests showed
that the way we handled these missings hardly influenced
our results.
Context Variables
The characteristics of the local educational facilities were
measured with four variables. School availability in the dis-
trict was indicated by the area served per school, measured
by dividing the number of square kilometers in a district by
the number of primary schools in that district. We used the
square root of this variable to address the fact that in well-
served areas, an additional school makes less of a difference.
Because availability is likely to be only a problem in the rural
areas, we included an interaction between this variable and
urbanization. The interaction term is defined in such a way
that the coefficient of availability in our tables represents the
effect in rural areas. The Teacher Child Ratio is computed by
taking the number of secondary school teachers per 1,000
children aged 10 to 19 in the district. Availability of female
teachers was measured by the percentage of female second-
ary school teachers in the district. For the duration of primary
education, we included a national-level variable indicating
the legal duration of primary education in years (derived
from InternationalAssociation of Universities, 2009).As this
variable is expected to reduce dropout only at the higher lev-
els of primary education, we also included an interaction
between this variable and the grade a child is in.
Data for schools and teachers are for public and private
school combined, except for Benin, Bolivia, Mozambique,
and Senegal. For Benin, only public data were available. For
Bolivia, the percentage of private teachers was lacking at the
district level. We therefore took the average of the percent-
ages of private pupils and private schools in the district. For
Mozambique data for public schools and for Senegal data for
public teachers were used because no private data were
available for these countries. For six countries (Colombia,
Peru, Congo Brazzaville, Madagascar, Namibia, and
Bangladesh), the percentage of female teachers was not avail-
able at the district level; therefore, national figures were used.
For part of the countries, the year of the household survey
differed from the year for which data regarding schools and
teachers were available. To test whether this might influence
our results, we added a variable indicating the difference
between the survey year and the school characteristics year
to our models. This variable proved to be non-significant in
all our analyses.
The labor market opportunities in the district are indicated
by the percentage of men working in a white-collar (profes-
sional, technical, managerial, clerical) occupation. District
level of development is measured by an index constructed on
the basis of six variables aggregated from our household
datasets: the percentages of households in the district with a
fridge, car, telephone, television, electricity, or running
water. Of these characteristics, the mean was taken of the
standardized values. National development is measured by
national gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in
Purchasing Power Parity (constant 2,000 international dol-
lar) derived from The World Bank (2009).
Cultural issues related to gender are measured with two
district variables. To indicate the degree to which women are
disadvantaged, we use the absolute difference between the
percentages of men and women working in a white-collar
job. To indicate the degree to which women in the district
after their marriage come to live in the families of their hus-
bands, we use the percentage of married couples living in a
household where also parents from father's side are living.
Results
Table 1 shows that in almost all countries, the percentage of
children in school at time of survey was low at age 7, then
increased until it reached its highest level in the 10 to 12 age
group, after which it decreased again. In most countries, par-
ticipation rates at age 15 are substantially lower than at age
12, thus revealing high dropout rates. The low participation
rates at age 7 make clear that in the countries included in our
study, quite a few children start school later than legally
obliged. Hence, besides non-enrollment and dropout, start-
ing late is a problem. In most countries (16 of the 30) a higher
percentage of girls than boys is in schools at age 7. As chil-
dren get older, the percentage of boys in school becomes
higher than that of girls in ever more countries.
Table 2 shows the results of the discrete-time event-his-
tory analyses. Model 1 contains only coefficients of the main
effects. Model 2 is similar to Model 1 but with the significant
interaction effects added. To keep the table readable, the
interaction coefficients are presented separately in Table 3.
We present multiplicative coefficients because these are
most easily understood. For example, the value of 2.68 for
the effect of father having at least some secondary education
means that the odds of staying in school are 2.68 times (or
168%) higher for children (girls and boys) whose father has at
least some secondary education compared with children
whose father has no education. The value of 0.95 for girls
whose mother is working indicates that these girls have 0.95
times (or 5%) lower odds of staying in school than girls whose
mother is not working. For those variables that interacted

significantly with sex, separate coefficients for boys and
girls are presented; otherwise, a general coefficient is pre-
sented under "All." Our analyses show that of the total vari-
ance in educational participation, 72% is explained at the
household level, 23% at the district level, and 5% at the
national level. Hence, differences among households are
responsible for almost three quarter of differences in educa-
tional participation.
Effects of the household and contextual resources are
largely as expected. Father's and mother's education, father's
occupation being upper non-farm and household wealth have
significant positive coefficients. The effect of mother's edu-
cation is stronger for girls, which is in line with earlier find-
ings (Emerson & Portela Souza, 2007). Mother's employment
has no significant average effect on staying in school, but
this effect is significantly more favorable for boys.
If there are more teachers available, as indicated by a
higher teacher child ratio, chances that children stay in school
increase significantly. The average effect of a higher propor-
tion of female teachers in the district is not significant,
although its effect is positive for girls. In earlier research
(Huisman & Smits, 2009), a higher percentage of female
teachers was found to promote girls' participation in primary
education. Hence, female teachers seem to be more impor-
tant for getting young girls into school than for keeping them
there. With regard to the availability of schools in rural areas,
we find a significantly negative association between the size
of the area served by schools and girls staying in school. For
boys, availability seems to be less of a problem.
Regarding the effects of structural factors, we see that
when a father or mother is missing from the household, the
likelihood of staying in school is significantly reduced. The
negative effect of a missing mother is stronger for girls.
Living in an extended household with grandparents, being a
biological or a later-born child have significant positive asso-
ciations with a child staying in school, whereas having more
siblings is negative for all children. The availability of white-
collar jobs in the district is associated with a significant
increase in both boys' and girls' likelihood to stay in school.
Regarding the role of the local culture, we observe that
having a more traditional mother, as indicated by the age she
had her first child, is negative for all children. Living in a
patriarchal culture, as indicated by a higher percentage of
households with parents of the father, is not significant. For
girls, the effect of living in a district where the gender differ-
ence in the higher echelon of the labor market is wider is
negative, but this effect is not significant. These two vari-
ables were significant when tested bivariately, indicating that
more patriarchal districts tend to differ with regard to other
factors in the model that affect children's chances to stay in
school.
Urbanization and national GDP per capita show signifi-
cant effects in the expected direction. The odds of staying in
school are higher in countries with higher levels of GDP per
capita and--for girls--also in urban areas (Model 2).
However, the effect of our other variable which indicates a
more modern context in which education might be valued
higher, the district development index, is significantly

negative, opposite to what was expected. This may seem
counterintuitive. However, bivariately this variable showed
the expected positive effect. Hence, the negative multivari-
ate effect is the result of controlling for other development-
related factors.
As could be expected, children drop out significantly
more in the higher grades. They also have a substantially
higher likelihood of dropping out directly after finishing pri-
mary school. This last effect seems to be stronger than that of
any other factor in the model. We also see that dropout in the
higher grades is lower in countries where the legal duration
of primary education is longer. Both findings are in line with
the idea that children (and their parents) tend to wait until
they have completed primary education before they stop
schooling.
Interaction Effects
Table 3 presents the coefficients of significant interactions.
The likelihood to continue school directly after finishing pri-
mary school is increased for boys from extended households
with grandparents. This indicates that grandparents consider
secondary education for their grandsons important and are
prepared to take over tasks or help with homework to facili-
tate that. Directly after completing primary education, the
effects of father's occupation and education are significantly
reduced. Hence, at that time, the decision to drop out seems
less influenced by socioeconomic differences than at other
points in the school career.
With the teacher­child ratio, we find one significant inter-
action. The positive effect of this factor is stronger in countries

with a higher GDP per capita. This finding runs opposite to
the idea of, for instance, Heyneman and Loxley that in less
developed countries the impact of schools and teachers is
stronger. The significant positive effect of female teachers in
rural areas, in contrast, is in line with their idea. Hence,
increasing the number of female teachers might reduce rural
dropout (which is especially strong for girls). In districts
with a higher percentage of female teachers, the positive
effects of father's occupation and household wealth are
higher. This indicates that girls from such households (for
whom the effect of female teachers is positive) are better able
to profit from these favorable educational circumstances,
leading to a kind of accumulation of positive effects.
However for boys, such household conditions compensate
them for the negative effect that female teachers have for
them. Moreover, in those districts the negative effect of more
brothers is stronger for boys, pointing toward competition
within the household. We also found that in districts with a
higher percentage of female teachers, the tendency to drop
out in the higher grades increases. Hence, older children and
children from households with more competition and fewer
resources seem to profit less from the presence of female
teachers.
Most interactions with urbanization are as expected. In
rural areas, children from extended households with grand-
parents and biological daughters are more likely to stay in
school. Thus in rural areas, there seem to be more duties at
home that can be taken over by grandparents or put on the
shoulders of foster daughters. The negative effects of more
siblings and a mother who got her first child young are also
stronger in rural areas. This is in line with the idea that in
urban areas educational facilities are more accessible, so that
children from more difficult or competitive backgrounds
have more possibilities to go to school. The negative effect
of the presence of (more) sisters for boys in rural areas might
as well be interpreted as meaning that boys in cities profit
from the presence of sisters.
In more developed districts, a missing father has a stron-
ger negative effect, whereas for boys the effect of a father
with an upper non-farm job becomes less positive. However,
the effect of paternal education in those districts becomes
even more important, which might be interpreted as support
for Heyneman and Loxley's idea that when the level of
development is higher, family background characteristics are
more important. In countries with a higher GDP per capita,
living in an extended household with grandparents is less
important.
Conclusion
We studied effects of household and district-level factors on
school dropout of young children in the first years of the 21th
century by applying multi-level discrete-time event-history
analysis on data for over 130,000 children in 363 districts of
30 developing countries. We tested four hypotheses: (a) The
resource hypothesis predicts that children from households
and contexts with more resources available for schooling are
less likely to drop out of school; (b) the structure hypothesis
predicts that in households and contexts where the structure is
such that children can benefit more from the available
resources and from going to school, children are less likely to
drop out of school; (c) the culture hypothesis predicts that if
the local culture is such that education is valued more relative
to other options, children are less likely to drop out of school;
(d) the primary duration hypothesis predicts that children are
more likely to drop out after finishing a specific level. Besides
direct effects of the determining factors, we studied interac-
tion effects to make our study more situation-specific.
Regarding the attendance rates by age, our descriptive
analysis reveals two major patterns. First, in almost all of the
countries children tend to start schooling at an age that is
(often substantially) higher than the legal starting age of pri-
mary education. Second, participation rates are highest in the
9 to 12 age group, and then start to decrease. In most coun-
tries, participation rates at age 15 are substantially lower than
those at age 12, thus revealing high dropout rates.
With respect to the determinants of school dropout, we
find that children from households and contexts with more
resources are much more likely to stay in school, supporting
our first hypothesis. Higher educated parents, a wealthier
household, and a father with a higher-level job are strongly
positively associated with children staying in school. Parental
education and household wealth are most important. If the
father has more than primary education, the odds of staying in
school for both girls and boys are 157% higher than if the father
has no education, and if the household is in a one-step higher
wealth decile, this odds increases by 20%. Mother's education
is especially important. The odds of staying in school increases
by 77% for daughters and by 40% for sons if the mother is in
the higher educational category. This result indicates that moth-
ers with more knowledge are in a better position to keep their
children in school. This knowledge probably need not be very
extensive; we only distinguished between none and at least
some education. Given the substantial difference in school
dropout found with this simple variable, it seems that basic
skills such as reading and writing are critical.
District availability of teachers (indicated by a higher
teacher child ratio) is associated with a significant positive
effect on a child's likelihood to stay in school, and district
availability of schools in rural areas is positive for girls. The
percentage of female teachers is not associated with a signifi-
cant average effect on staying in school, but interactions
show a significantly positive association in rural areas.
Hence, female teachers seem particularly important under
more difficult circumstances. In addition, children in lower
grades drop out significantly less if there are more female
teachers.
We also find support for our second hypothesis on the
effect of structural characteristics of households and contexts.
Children from households with a structure which is less
Huisman and Smits 13
favorable for them, that is, children with more siblings, chil-
dren who have younger siblings, and children whose mother
or father is missing from the household, are significantly less
likely to stay in school. The effect of a missing mother is
stronger for girls. However, living in an extended household
with grandparents and being a biological child are associated
with a higher likelihood to stay in school, whereby grandpar-
ents are especially important in poorer countries as indicated
by our interaction results. Also a structural context in which
education is more valuable, because it makes it more likely
to find a higher paid occupation, as indicated by a higher
percentage of men with a white-collar job, is associated with
a higher likelihood of children staying in school.
The results regarding our third hypothesis on culture are
less convincing. Having a mother who got her first child at a
young age, an indication of a more traditional household, is
not significant. Also the effect of the district-level variables
measuring the gender difference on the labor market and the
tendency for girls to marry into their husband's family are
not significant, suggesting that variation in school dropout
between more and less traditional districts is largely due to
variation in other household and district characteristics. A
higher national GDP per capita, and for girls also living in an
urban area are positively associated with staying in school,
indicating that in a more developed environment education is
more valued as we hypothesized. However, the district
development index (constructed based on assets of house-
holds in the district) was negatively associated with staying
in school. This might mean that developed districts have bet-
ter income-earning opportunities for children, so that child
labor would be an attractive alternative.
Regarding the fourth hypothesis of this study, about the
effect of extending the duration of primary education on
school dropout, several pieces of evidence are relevant. First,
we found that in countries where the legal duration of pri-
mary education is longer, dropout in the higher grades is sig-
nificantly lower. Second, the odds of continuing schooling
were strongly reduced (about 70%) directly after finishing
primary education. The magnitude of this effect is larger than
that of any other variable in the model, stressing its impor-
tance. Third, the increased risk of school dropout after com-
pleting primary education was independent of the number of
grades the child had completed (no significant interaction
between grade and having recently finished primary educa-
tion). Together, these pieces of evidence clearly indicate that
directly after completing primary education there is a critical
choice moment with a strongly elevated risk of dropping out
of the educational system.
This risk moreover seems not restricted to the lower lev-
els of society. Our interaction analysis makes clear that right
after finishing primary education, the advantage of having a
father with an upper non-farm job or with at least some pri-
mary education is significantly reduced. Hence, the tendency
to drop out of school after completing primary education is
not restricted to households with the fewest resources. Only
children in households with grandparents, especially boys,
are less likely to drop out of school after finishing primary
education, thus stressing the importance of this form of fam-
ily capital for educational achievement in poor countries.
Given these findings, it seems advisable for countries with
high dropout rates of young children to consider prolonging
the legal duration of primary education (as was done in
Turkey in 1998) as a policy to keep children in school longer.
Of course, such a policy may make a heavy demand on the
available primary school facilities and requires a transfer of
means from the lower secondary to the primary level.
Regarding the other interactions we conducted to make our
analyses more situation-specific, we find that children who
were already in a more favorable situation (higher wealth
group, father with a higher education, girls with a father with
a non-farm occupation, extended households, biological
daughters, fewer siblings, a mother who did not have her first
child young) profit more from the availability of female teach-
ers, or are less affected by living in a rural or less developed
area. The evidence is not conclusive, however, as we also
found that in better developed districts, the advantage of the
father being present in the household and advantage of having
a father with an upper non-farm job are less important.
The finding that female teachers are especially important
in rural areas provides support for the Heyneman­Loxley
hypothesis that educational facilities make more difference
at lower development levels. Only the stronger effect of the
teacher­child ratio in higher GDP countries is not in line
with this hypothesis.
Some words of caution are needed. First, although the use
of context factors at the district level is a major step forward
compared with research using such factors at the national
level, the degree to which they represent the local context
remains restricted, because the districts are still rather big.As
a result, our coefficients may underestimate the true effects.
Second, some additional measurement error might be
expected in the district-level characteristics of the educa-
tional facilities, because they had to be collected from other
sources, which for developing countries are not always of
good quality. District characteristics that we created our-
selves by aggregating from our representative household sur-
veys are more reliable. Third, for children who dropped out
of school, we do not have reliable information on the age at
which this happened. Hence, our conclusions are mainly
valid for dropping out in specific grades and not for dropping
out at a specific age. Fourth, the substantial number of sig-
nificant cross-level interactions found in our analyses con-
firms our expectation that the processes underlying the
decision to drop out may differ substantially among contexts.
At the same time, it is difficult to give clear interpretations
for the outcomes of the interaction analysis, which not
always point clearly to one direction. New theories on the
role of the context are therefore needed, the development of
which constitutes a major challenge to the research commu-
nity in this field.
