Context: Comprehensive descriptions of substance use
and abuse trajectories have been lacking in nationally rep-
resentative samples of adolescents.
Objective: To examine the prevalence, age at onset, and
sociodemographic correlates of alcohol and illicit drug
use and abuse among US adolescents.
Design: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents using a
modified version of the Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview.
Setting: Combined household and school adolescent
samples.
Participants: Nationally representative sample of 10 123
adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime estimates of al-
cohol and illicit substance use and DSM-IV diagnoses of
abuse, with or without dependence.
Results: By late adolescence, 78.2% of US adolescents had
consumedalcohol,47.1%hadreachedregulardrinkinglev-
els defined by at least 12 drinks within a given year, and
15.1% met criteria for lifetime abuse. The opportunity to
use illicit drugs was reported by 81.4% of the oldest ado-
lescents, drug use by 42.5%, and drug abuse by 16.4%. The
median age at onset was 14 years for alcohol abuse with
or without dependence, 14 years for drug abuse with de-
pendence, and 15 years for drug abuse without depen-
dence. The associations observed by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity often varied significantly by previous stage of use.
Conclusions: Alcohol and drug use is common in US
adolescents, and the findings of this study indicate that
most cases of abuse have their initial onset in this im-
portant period of development. Prevention and treat-
ment efforts would benefit from careful attention to the
correlates and risk factors that are specific to the stage
of substance use in adolescents.

THE PATTERNS OF ALCOHOL
and drug use that emerge
during adolescence are in-
creasingly recognized as
important determinants of
later substance use behavior and associ-
ated disorders.1-9 Estimates from major sur-
veys in the United States, including the Na-
tional Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH),10 the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Surveys (NHANES),11
and the Monitoring the Future study,12 in-
dicate that by 17 years of age most ado-
lescents (59% to 71%) had consumed al-
cohol, 31% to 44% had tried cannabis, and
4% to 6% had tried cocaine. Although each
of these investigations provides informa-
tion on the prevalence of alcohol or drug
use among adolescents, only the NSDUH
examined substance use disorders, and the
assessments were limited to symptoms ex-
perienced during the previous 12 months.
The only national survey to use direct di-
agnostic interviews regarding both cur-
rent and lifetime substance use among US
adolescents recently described large in-
creases in the cumulative incidence of sub-
stance use disorders between 13 and 18
years of age13 and an overall lifetime preva-
lence that approaches that of adult
samples.14-17 Nationally representative data
concerning the full trajectory of sub-
stance use and associated disorders in ado-
lescence have been lacking and are neces-
sary for attaining further progress in
prevention and public health objectives.18
In addition to more complete descrip-
tions of substance use trajectories in ado-
lescents, assessment of factors associated
with the development of substance use dis-
orders in nationally representative samples
is crucial. Epidemiologic investigations of
adults have consistently demonstrated a
higher prevalence of abuse and depen-
dence among males,14-20 as well as de-
creased prevalence of these disorders

among certain minority ethnic subgroups.14-17,21 Despite
the marked increase in the prevalence of substance use
disorders from early to late adolescence,13 it is uncertain
to what degree these sociodemographic differences may
characterize recent adolescent cohorts. For example, no
salient sex differences were observed for initial alcohol
or illicit drug use in NHANES between 1999 and 2004,
and ethnic differences for illicit substances in this inves-
tigation were at times contrary to the adult literature.11
An additional rationale for understanding sociodemo-
graphic variation is the need for information concern-
ing the timing of their influence across the substance use
trajectory. Recent analyses of population-based surveys
have shown that the magnitude and even direction of as-
sociations observed for many sociodemographic vari-
ables are specific to stages of use.16,17,22,23 Analyses of so-
ciodemographic factors conditioned on stage of previous
use are currently lacking in US adolescent samples, and
little is known about the timing of their expression dur-
ing this key stage of development.
The present investigation examines these issues in the
National Comorbidity Survey­Adolescent Supplement
(NCS-A), a nationally representative survey that used di-
rect diagnostic interviews with youth aged 13 to 18 years.
The goals of this report are to (1) describe the preva-
lence of 4 lifetime stages of alcohol use (use, regular use,
abuse without dependence, and abuse with depen-
dence) and 4 lifetime stages of illicit drug use (opportu-
nity to use, first drug use, drug abuse without depen-
dence, and drug abuse with dependence); (2) estimate the
prevalence of these stages by age, sex, and race/ethnicity;
and (3) examine the association of these sociodemo-
graphic variables with the risk of transition among stages.
METHODS
SAMPLE AND PROCEDURE
The NCS-A is a nationally representative, face-to-face survey
of 10 123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental
United States conducted between February 1, 2001, and Janu-
ary 30, 2004.24 The survey was administered by the profes-
sional interview staff of the Institute for Social Research at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. There were 197 interview-
ers supervised by a team of 18 experienced regional supervi-
sors. A study manager located at the central facility in Michi-
gan oversaw the work of the supervisors and their staff. The
NCS-A was performed in a dual-frame sample that included a
household subsample and a school subsample.24-27 The overall
NCS-A response rate combining the 2 subsamples was 82.9%.
Comparisons of sample and population distributions on US Cen-
sus sociodemographic variables, and in the school sample on
school characteristics, documented only minor differences,
which were corrected with poststratification weighting. The re-
cruitment and consent procedures were approved by the Hu-
man Subjects Committees of both Harvard Medical School and
the University of Michigan. On making in-person contact, the
interviewer answered questions before obtaining written in-
formed consent from the parent and then written informed as-
sent from the adolescent. Once the survey was completed, cases
were weighted for variation in within-household probability of
selection (in the household subsample) and for residual dis-
crepancies between the sample and the US population on the
basis of sociodemographic and geographic variables. These
weighting procedures are discussed in more detail else-
where.26,27 Sociodemographic variables examined in this re-
port include age (in years), sex, and self-described race/
ethnicity. Approximately half the sample was male (51.3%) and
the mean age was 15.2 years, with a larger proportion of ado-
lescents aged 13 to 14 years (36.2%) and approximately equal
distributions of adolescents aged 15 to 16 and 17 to 18 years.
The sample was composed of 65.6% non-Hispanic whites, 15.1%
non-Hispanic blacks, and 14.4% Hispanics.
OUTCOME MEASURES
Adolescents were administered a modified version (version 3.0)
of the World Health Organization Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview (CIDI), a fully structured interview admin-
istered by trained lay interviewers to generate DSM-IV diagno-
ses.28 The modifications to the CIDI were conducted following
a standard 4-step process of instrument development pro-
posed by experts in survey methods.24 First, diagnostic sec-
tions of the adult CIDI were reviewed to determine whether
assessment for particular disorders should be removed based
on low presumed prevalence in adolescents. Second, the lan-
guage in the remaining CIDI sections was modified to en-
hance comprehension with adolescents using an iterative pro-
cess. Third, CIDI modules were modified in content to make
them more germane to the contexts and experiences of ado-
lescents. The most common change of this type required al-
tering references from adult contexts (eg, work life and par-
enting) to adolescent contexts (eg, school life and peer
relationships). Fourth, the finalized revision of each diagnos-
tic module was reviewed for meaning, logic, and comparabil-
ity to the adult version. Each diagnostic section was then sys-
tematically piloted to test the flow and timing among adolescents,
with subsequent modifications to reduce the length of the di-
agnostic sections. Lifetime substance use disorders assessed in
the CIDI included alcohol and drug abuse, and individuals ful-
filling abuse criteria were administered questions concerning
dependence criteria. This report therefore presents both cat-
egories of abuse (with or without dependence). In light of dif-
ferences in the pertinence of diagnostic categories for nico-
tine, trajectories for this substance will be addressed in a separate
manuscript. In addition to DSM-IV diagnoses, all respondents
were asked about the use of diverse substances and their age
at which specific stages of use first occurred. For alcohol, the
lifetime use question concerned age at which respondents first
(if ever) had a drink with alcohol, specified as beer, wine, wine
coolers, and hard liquor (eg, vodka, gin, whiskey, and mixed
drinks). First regular use of alcohol was defined as the age at
which the respondent first had at least 12 drinks within a single
year. For illicit drugs, participants were asked their age at which
they had first (if ever) consumed a range of specific sub-
stances, including marijuana or hashish; cocaine in any form
(eg, powder, crack, freebase, coca leaves, or paste); tranquil-
izers, stimulants, pain killers, or other prescription drugs either
without the recommendation of a health professional or for any
reason other than a health professional said they should be used;
and heroin, opium, glue, lysergic acid diethylamide, peyote, or
any other drug. Participants were also asked about the first time
they had an opportunity to drink alcohol or use drugs, regard-
less of whether they used them. Opportunity to use was de-
fined as when someone either offered them alcohol or drugs
or when the individual was present when others were using and
could have used if he or she wanted to. The age at first oppor-
tunity to use substances was recorded separately for alcohol
and drugs. In light of the high availability of legal substances,
such as alcohol, only opportunity to use illicit drugs is exam-
ined in this investigation.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Cross-tabulations were used to calculate the prevalence of the
4 stages of alcohol and drug use by demographic characteris-
tics. Conditional prevalence estimates for each alcohol or drug
use stage were also calculated among those who had reached
the earlier stage of use. Estimated projections of the cumula-
tive probability of stages of alcohol or drug use as of the age of
18 years were obtained by the actuarial method implemented
in PROC LIFETEST in SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS
Institute, Inc). The associations of age, sex, and race/ethnicity
with the stages of alcohol or drug use were examined using mul-
tiple logistic regression analysis. Because the NCS-A data are
both clustered and weighted, the Taylor series linearization
method implemented in SUDAAN (version 10; Research Tri-
angle Institute) was used to estimate standard errors of logis-
tic regression coefficients. The coefficients and standard er-
rors were exponentiated to produce odds ratios and 95% CIs.
Significance of predictor sets was evaluated using Wald F tests
based on design-adjusted coefficient variance-covariance ma-
trices. Statistical significance was consistently evaluated using
2-sided tests with a .05 significance level.

RESULTS
PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC
VARIATION IN ALCOHOL USE STAGES
Alcohol use, regular use, and abuse were highly preva-
lent among US adolescents (Table 1). Most of the sample
(59.8%) reported alcohol use at some point in their life-
time, ranging from 42.5% for adolescents aged 13 to 14
years to 78.2% for adolescents aged 17 to 18 years. Nearly
1 in 10 adolescents reported regular alcohol use in the
13- to 14-year age cohort, a figure that increased to nearly
half (47.1%) of adolescents aged 17 to 18 years. Con-
cerning alcohol use disorders, 5.2% of all US adoles-
cents met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse without de-
pendence and 1.3% for alcohol abuse with dependence.
The prevalence of alcohol abuse with or without depen-
dence ranged from 1.3% for the youngest cohort to 15.1%
for adolescents 17 to 18 years old. The cumulative preva-
lence of alcohol use stages by age is presented in Figure 1.
The median age at onset of each category was 13 years
for first alcohol use and 14 years for regular use or abuse
(with or without dependence).
Male and female adolescents had essentially equiva-
lent rates of any alcohol use, but male adolescents dem-
onstrated slightly higher rates of regular use and abuse.
These sex differences were larger in individuals aged 17
to 18 years than in the 2 younger cohorts. Black and other
racial/ethnic groups generally reported lower rates of al-
cohol use, regular use, and abuse than either Hispanic
or white adolescents. These racial differences were ob-
served for each age cohort.

ferenceswereobservedintheproportionofindividualsmak-
ing transitions from one alcohol stage to another. The per-
centage of individuals at each stage making transitions to
the next was generally lowest for the black and other eth-
nic groups and was observable across all age cohorts.
PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC
VARIATION IN OPPORTUNITY TO USE DRUGS
AND DRUG USE STAGES
Most US adolescents (60.2%) reported having had the op-
portunity to use illicit drugs (Table 2). This exposure con-
cerned 39.2% of adolescents aged 13 to 14 years and 81.4%
of adolescents aged 17 to 18 years, thereby doubling dur-
ing the adolescent period. The use of illicit drugs for these
same cohorts ranged from 9.6% (nearly a quarter of ex-
posed youth aged 13-14 years) to 42.5% of the oldest ado-
lescents (52.2% of those exposed), respectively. Abuse of
illicit drugs was slightly more common than the abuse of
alcohol, ranging from 3.4% of youth in the 13- to 14-year
cohort to 16.4% of adolescents aged 17 to 18 years old.
Figure 2 presents the cumulative prevalence of drug use
stages by age. The median ages of onset for each category
were 13 years for the first opportunity to use illicit drugs,
14 years for the first illicit drug use, 14 years for drug abuse
with dependence, and 15 years for drug abuse without de-
pendence. Similar to the pattern in alcohol use, there was
a slight overall male preponderance in prevalence of stages
ofdruguse,whichwasmostpronouncedamongolderado-
lescents. The same pattern of racial/ethnic differences was
observed across the 3 age cohorts, with black and other ra-
cial/ethnic groups having typically lower rates than white
or Hispanic adolescents. High rates of opportunity to use
drugs and drug use were observed among Hispanic ado-
lescents, especially in the youngest age cohort. Concern-
ing conditional prevalence rates, 40.5% of the sample used
illicit drugs when given the opportunity, and more than
one-third of adolescents who used illicit drugs developed
abuse (36.6%). The overall patterns of effects by sex and
race/ethnicity in the conditional prevalence rates for drug
use stages were highly similar to those observed for alco-
hol, as demonstrated by increasing male preponderance in
transitions among older adolescents and generally lower
rates of transitions, particularly among black adolescents.
Concerning types of illicit drugs, cannabis was the most
frequently used substance in all age cohorts (Table 3).
The use of each category of illicit substance was again typi-
cally lowest for black adolescents and slightly higher for
male adolescents compared with female adolescents, with
the exception of prescription drug use.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS
OF TRANSITIONS AMONG ALCOHOL
AND DRUG USE STAGES
Adolescent age cohort, sex, and race/ethnicity in the risk
of transition among the alcohol and drug use stages were
examined in multivariate analyses (Table 4). For alco-
hol, the 2 younger age cohorts were less likely than ado-
lescents aged 17 to 18 years to become regular drinkers

to develop abuse (without dependence) if they had
reached regular use levels. Female adolescents were also
less likely to make the transition from any alcohol use
to regular use, as were adolescents who were black or
members of other racial/ethnic groups compared with
white adolescents. However, the patterns observed for
drug use categories were more complex in the multivar-
iate analyses than those observed for alcohol. The 2
younger cohorts were less likely than older adolescents
to use drugs when given the opportunity, but no signifi-
cant sex differences were observed in the risk of transi-
tion among drug use stages. Black adolescents were less
likely than white adolescents to use drugs when given
the opportunity and less likely to abuse drugs (without
dependence) if they were drug users. Conversely, ado-

COMMENT
Knowledge of the developmental trajectories of alcohol
and illicit drug use among US adolescents has relied on
retrospective reports from nationally representative adult
samples and on prospective observation of clinical co-
horts and local community youth samples. The pur-
poses of the present investigation were to estimate in a
nationally representative sample of adolescents the preva-
lence of multiple states of alcohol and illicit drug use and
abuse and to examine the association of sociodemo-
graphic variables with transitions across these sub-
stance use categories.
The present study reports several novel findings con-
cerning the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and drug
abuse among US youth. Although the NSDUH has shown
that the rates of abuse with or without dependence of al-
cohol or illicit drugs have converged during the past sev-
eral years among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, we found
greater rates for drug abuse (8.9%) than alcohol abuse
(6.5%) among adolescents. Our conditional analyses also
revealed high rates of regular use and abuse in adoles-
cent substance users. Among alcohol users, 42.2% re-
ported regular use, and 25.9% of these regular drinkers
met criteria for abuse with or without dependence. For
illicit substances, 40.5% reported using drugs after hav-
ing had the opportunity to do so, and nearly 36.6% of
drug users met criteria for abuse with or without depen-
dence. These conditional rates are higher than base (un-
conditional) rates reported by prior surveys of youth and
therefore provide additional information concerning risk
of substance abuse after initial use during adolescence.
The risk of drug abuse among adolescent users is of con-
cern considering the recent findings from the Monitor-
ing the Future and NSDUH, which show a resurgence
of marijuana use among adolescents, even surpassing use
of nicotine, a finding that may reflect increasingly toler-
ant attitudes concerning the use of illicit drugs.10,12
The median age at onset of alcohol abuse with or with-
out dependence was 14 years, with 15.1% meeting diag-
nostic criteria by 18 years of age. Drug abuse was char-
acterized by a similarly young median age at onset and
with a prevalence of 16.4% among the oldest adoles-
cents. These adolescent lifetime prevalence estimates for
abuse can be compared with adult prevalences observed
in the National Comorbidity Survey­Replication, a study
that used parallel methods and was conducted concur-
rently with the NCS-A. Lifetime prevalence of alcohol
abuse in the adult survey (18.6%) was only marginally
higher than the adolescent prevalence we observed,
whereas the prevalence of drug abuse among adults
(11.1% overall and 15.1% for the youngest cohort aged
19-30) was actually lower than the adolescent preva-
lences we estimated.16,17
Taken together, these findings suggest greater inci-
dence risk and lifetime prevalence of substance abuse dur-
ing adolescence than has been estimated from adult
samples.14-17 Such differences are likely to reflect the in-
clusion of older-onset cases in investigations of adults and
increases in retrospective memory biases in these samples.
It also remains possible that younger cohorts are more
likely to use specific substances or to use them at an ear-
lier age. In this regard, the conditional analyses demon-
strate that the risk of abuse among users is particularly
high among the youngest adolescents. The conditional
rate for abuse with or without dependence among the
youngest drug users (13-14 years old) is 10-fold the un-
conditional rate (35.4% vs 3.4%). By contrast, the con-
ditional rate of abuse with or without dependence among
the oldest adolescents is just more than twice the un-
conditional rate (38.6% vs 16.4%). Although high con-
ditional rates in younger adolescents may be partly at-
tributable to the low unconditional prevalences, they
nonetheless pinpoint early adolescence as a period of
heightened risk for substance use and abuse.29,30 The el-
evated rate and risk of substance use and abuse among
youth should be considered relative to neuroimaging data
that demonstrate the occurrence of important matura-
tional changes in the brain during adolescence, particu-
larly in regions associated with regulatory control and
decision making. Such normative developmental pro-
cesses may be substantially compromised by substance
use.31-35
Although probability of each stage of alcohol and drug
use increased with age, rates were almost always lowest
for black and other racial/ethnic groups compared with
white or Hispanic adolescents. These findings may con-
tradict common assumptions but are consistent with pre-
vious investigations in adult and adolescent samples.10,11
No salient sex differences were observed in lifetime al-
cohol use, whereas minor differences were observed for
all other stages of alcohol or drug use among adoles-
cents aged 13 to 16 years. However, for those 17 to 18
years of age, male adolescents had notably higher rates
for most stages of alcohol or drug use. These findings are
globally consistent with previous reports of the associa-
tions between sociodemographic characteristics and sub-
stance use and substance use disorders11,12,14,16-21,29 and
indicate that sex differences in substance use behavior

are most visible after 15 years of age. In conditional analy-
ses, male alcohol users were significantly more likely to
transition to regular alcohol use, whereas no sex differ-
ences were associated with drug use transitions. Re-
duced risk for black adolescents was significant only in
transitions from alcohol use to regular use, from having
the opportunity to use drugs to drug use, and from drug
use to drug abuse without dependence. Despite lower rates
of drug use among other racial/ethnic groups, these ado-
lescents were more likely than white adolescents to tran-
sition from use to abuse with dependence. These find-
ings are concordant with previous studies16,17,22,29
demonstrating that stage of previous substance use mod-
erates the role of sociodemographic factors.
The principal strengths of this study include its use
of a nationally representative adolescent sample with di-
rect diagnostic interviews and the assessment of mul-
tiple stages of alcohol and drug use. Study limitations in-
clude its cross-sectional design, retrospective reporting
for age at onset information, and the lack of assessment
of alcohol or drug dependence without a history of abuse.
However, although we would expect that only a small
proportion of youth would be excluded in this latter rea-
son, the conclusions are limited to the categories exam-
ined and may not be generalizable outside of the US ado-
lescent population. Caution is also warranted in drawing
parallels to findings from retrospective estimates in adult
samples because such interviews may underestimate rates

due to forgetting or other memory biases and may in-
crease biases in estimates of age of disorder onset due to
the longer period of recall.36
In addition, the use of the term lifetime to describe the
prevalence of substance use disorders in adolescence does
not necessarily indicate the persistence of these disorders
inthelongterm,inparticularbecauseindividualsmay"ma-
ture out" of harmful substance use as they progress into
adulthood or begin to assume adult responsibilities.37,38 A
final limitation of the present investigation is that it can-
not account for societal factors that vary over time and that
affect prevalence rates, such as the degree of tolerance for
specific illicit substances or their availability. It is impor-
tant to consider that psychoactive substances are impli-
cated in more than 12% of mortality worldwide and their
use constitutes the leading cause of preventable death.39,40
Because the early onset of substance use is a significant pre-
dictor of substance use behavior and disorders in a life-
span,1-9 the public health implications of the current find-
ings are far reaching. The prevention of both alcohol and
illicit drug abuse requires strategies that target early ado-
lescence and take into account the highly differential in-
fluence that population-based factors may exert by stage
of substance use. The lack of information concerning the
precise stage of alcohol or drug use most associated with
sociodemographic factors may partly explain the modest
success observed for certain prevention strategies.41-43 An
additional challenge for national policy concerns the emer-
gence of drug instrumentalization models that emphasize
the adaptive role that psychoactive substances may play in
the daily lives of nondependent individuals.44 The critical
evaluation of such perspectives and the development of ap-
propriate national policy on alcohol and drug use can only
