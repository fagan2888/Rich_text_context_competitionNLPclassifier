Abstract
Introduction Sepsis is the 10th leading cause of death in the
United States. The National Center for Health Statistics'
multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) dataset is a large, publicly
available, population-based source of information on disease
burden in the United States. We have analysed MCOD data
from 1999 to 2005 to investigate trends, assess disparities and
provide population-based estimates of sepsis-associated
mortality during this period.
Methods Sepsis-associated deaths occurring in the United
States from 1999 to 2005 were identified in MCOD data using
International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10)
codes. Population-based mortality rates were calculated using
bridged-race population estimates from the National Center for
Health Statistics. Comparisons across age, sex and racial/
ethnic groups were achieved by calculating mortality rate ratios.
Results From 1999 to 2005 there were 16,948,482 deaths in
the United States. Of these, 1,017,616 were associated with
sepsis (6.0% of all deaths). The age-adjusted rate of sepsis-
associated mortality was 50.37 deaths per 100,000 (95%
confidence interval (CI) = 50.28 to 50.47). There were
significant disparities in sepsis-associated mortality in race/
ethnicity and sex groups (P < 0.0001). After controlling for age,
Asians were less likely than whites to experience sepsis-related
death (rate ratio (RR) = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.77 to 0.78), while
Blacks (RR = 2.24, 95% CI = 2.23 to 2.24), American Indians/
Alaska Natives (RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.25) and
Hispanics (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.14) were more likely
than whites to experience sepsis-related death. Men were at
increased risk for sepsis-associated death in all race/ethnicity
categories (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.28), but the degree
of increased susceptibility associated with being male differed
among racial/ethnic groups (P < 0.0001). Although crude
sepsis-associated mortality increased by 0.67% per year during
the study period (P < 0.0001), the age-adjusted mortality rate
decreased by 0.18% per year (P < 0.01).
Conclusions The rapid rise in sepsis mortality seen in previous
decades has slowed, but population ageing continues to drive
the growth of sepsis-associated mortality in the United States.
Disparities in sepsis-associated mortality mirror those previously
reported for sepsis incidence. Sepsis in Asians, Hispanics and
American Indian/Alaska Natives should be studied separately
because aggregate measures may obscure important
differences among these groups.
Introduction
Sepsis is the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States,
and one of only two infectious conditions listed in the leading
15 causes of death [1]. Sepsis incidence and mortality have
increased over the course of several decades [2-4]. In addition
to being common and often lethal, sepsis is costly, with an
annual economic burden estimated at $16.7 billion [5].
Since 1992, sepsis has been defined by consensus as a sys-
temic inflammatory response syndrome of infectious origin [6].
The failure of one or more organ systems or the occurrence of
hypoperfusion in conjunction with sepsis is considered to be
severe sepsis. Severe sepsis accompanied by hypotension is
septic shock [7]. Death in septic patients has not been
explained by autopsy studies, but it has been suggested that
the cause of death is usually multiple organ failure [8,9].

Known risk factors for developing sepsis include advanced
age, male gender and non-white race [5,10]. Comorbidities
commonly associated with the condition include HIV infection,
cancer, cirrhosis, alcohol dependence and pressure ulcers
[11-16].
A number of recent studies have used administrative datasets
to assess the burden and epidemiological features of sepsis
[2,4,5,17-20]. Angus and colleagues used discharge records
from a multi-state sample of non-federal hospitals to assess
the incidence, outcome and economic burden of severe sep-
sis in the United States for the calendar year of 1995 [5]. Dom-
brovskiy and colleagues have employed discharge data from
the New Jersey State Inpatient Database and the Nationwide
Inpatient Sample to investigate trends and disparities in sepsis
as well as severe sepsis on the state and national level
[2,18,19]. Martin and colleagues [4] used the National Hospi-
tal Discharge Survey to quantify sepsis over a 21-year period,
while Esper and colleagues [17] used the same data to probe
at the role of comorbidity in sepsis disparities.
Few population-based sources of data can be used to investi-
gate the burden of sepsis-associated mortality on a national
level. To date, investigators have relied on samples of hospital
discharge data for such estimates [2,4,5,17-20]. These data
are weighted to extrapolate to national-level estimates and are
therefore particularly vulnerable to sampling bias. Furthermore,
mortality estimates from hospital data cannot be population
based because sepsis-associated deaths may occur in non-
hospital settings.
This study assessed sepsis-associated mortality using United
States multiple-cause of-death (MCOD) data. Although
MCOD data has been used to estimate national-level mortality
rates for a variety of health conditions [16,21-25], we are not
aware of previous studies that used this source of data to
address sepsis. We have examined MCOD data from 1999 to
2005 to determine population-based estimates, trends and
disparities in sepsis-related mortality.
Materials and methods
We obtained MCOD data for sepsis-associated deaths occur-
ring from 1999 to 2005. The study period was selected
because 2005 was the most recent year for which data were
available, and because MCOD coding practices changed
between 1998 and 1999, with 1999 representing the first
year that the data were coded according to the International
Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [26]. MCOD
data are abstracted from death certificates by the National
Center for Health Statistics [27]. This study relied on publicly
and de-identified data on deceased individuals, and conse-
quently does not constitute research with human subjects
according to Title 45, part 45, of the Code of Federal Regula-
tions [28]. The University of Southern California exempts such
research from Institutional Review Board oversight [29].
The underlying cause of death is "the disease or injury which
initiated the train of morbid events leading directly or indirectly
to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence
which produced the fatal injury" [30]. National Center for
Health Statistics employs underlying cause of death to report
national mortality statistics. Sepsis is known to affect the eld-
erly and other populations with high rates of chronic condi-
tions which predispose them to infection [5,10,12-16]. For
patients with underlying pathologies, sepsis may be a neces-
sary condition in the causal pathway leading to death, but may
not be listed as the underlying cause of death. Similarly, in
cases where sepsis results from nosocomial infection, the
original reason for hospitalisation, rather than sepsis, is often
listed as the underlying cause of death. Consequently, analy-
ses restricted only to decedents with sepsis listed as the
underlying cause of death will significantly underestimate the
true burden of sepsis-associated mortality.
Sepsis-related death was defined as a death where any of the
following ICD-10 codes appears in any field of the death cer-
tificate: A40.0 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group A),
A40.1 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group B), A40.2
(septicaemia due to streptococcus, group C), A40.3 (septi-
caemia due to streptococcal pneumonia), A40.8 (other strep-
tococcal septicaemia), A40.9 (streptococcal septicaemia,
unspecified), A41.0 (septicemia due to Staphylococcus
aureus), A41.1 (septicaemia due to other specified staphylo-
coccus), A41.2 (septicaemia due to other unspecified staphy-
lococcus), A41.3 (septicaemia due to Haemophilus
influenzae), A41.4 (septicaemia due to anaerobes), A41.5
(septicaemia due to other Gram-negative organisms), A41.8
(other specified septicaemia), A41.9 (septicaemia, unspeci-
fied), A02.1 (salmonella septicaemia), A22.7 (anthrax septi-
caemia), A26.8 (erysipelothrix septicaemia), A32.7 (listerial
septicaemia), A42.7 (actinomycotic septicaemia), B00.7 (her-
pesviral septicaemia), and B37.7 (candidal septicaemia). Like
other researchers who have investigated sepsis utilising
administrative datasets, we used ICD codes for septicaemia to
identify sepsis-associated deaths [2,4,17-19].
For sepsis-associated deaths we analysed age, sex, race, eth-
nicity, year-of-death, place-of-death and any other medical
conditions mentioned on the death certificate. A single five-
category race/ethnicity variable was created by treating all
those with Hispanic ethnicity as Hispanic, and categorising all
non-Hispanics according to race group (black, Asian, Ameri-
can Indian/Alaska Native, white). Age categories employed in
standardisation and calculation of age-specific rates and
ratios were: less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 14 years, 15 to
24 years, 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, 55
to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years and 85+ years.
Mortality rates were calculated using bridged-race population
estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics
[31,32]. Age-adjusted rates were standardised to the popula-
tion of the United States in 2000. Statistical comparison of

medians was accomplished with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
tests for independent samples. Differences in rate ratios were
compared using chi-squared tests for homogeneity. Unless
otherwise noted all reported rates and rate-ratios are age-
adjusted. Rate ratios (RR) are the only measure of relative risk
reported. Confidence intervals (CI) for rates and rate-ratios
were calculated based on variance estimates derived from the
Poisson distribution. Time trends were assessed using Pois-
son regression. Data analysis employed SAS 9.1 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and Excel 2003 (Microsoft Corp,
Redmond, WA, USA).
Results
From 1999 to 2005 there were 16,948,482 deaths in the
United States. Of these, 1,017,616 were associated with sep-
sis (6.0% of all deaths). Demographic characteristics, place of
death and frequency of comorbidities listed on the death cer-
tificates of sepsis decedents are shown in Table 1. Median
age for sepsis decedents was 76 years. Males were younger
than females: the median age-at-death among men was 74
years compared with 79 years among women (P < 0.0001).
The great majority of sepsis-associated deaths occurred in
hospitals, clinics and medical centres (86.9%) and of these
94.6% were inpatients. Other frequent places of death were
nursing homes and residences.
During the study period, the average annual crude sepsis-
associated mortality rate in the United States was 50.49
deaths per 100,000 persons (95% CI = 50.39 to 50.59).
From 1999 to 2005 the crude annual mortality rate increased
from 50.14 (95% CI = 49.87 to 50.40) to 52.28 (95% CI =
52.02 to 52.54) deaths per 100,000 persons, corresponding
to an annual increase of 0.67% (P < 0.0001). After age stand-
ardisation the average annual sepsis-associated mortality rate
was 50.37 deaths per 100,000 persons (95% CI = 50.28 to
50.47). In contrast to crude mortality, the age-adjusted rate of
sepsis-associated mortality decreased by 0.18% per year dur-
ing the study period (P < 0.01).
Race-specific and sex-specific rates of annual sepsis-associ-
ated mortality are reported in Table 2. Despite the predomi-
nance of women among decedents (53.4%), after controlling
for age, men were more likely to experience sepsis-associated
death (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.28). The increased risk
for men persisted in every age group and among all races. The
magnitude of association between male sex and sepsis-asso-
ciated mortality varied among races (P < 0.0001). The associ-
ation was largest in Asian males, who were 45% more likely
than their female counterparts to experience sepsis-associ-
ated death (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.41 to 1.49). The effect of
male sex on sepsis-related mortality was least apparent in
American Indians/Alaska Natives (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01
to 1.12).

We found significant racial disparities in sepsis-associated
mortality (P < 0.0001). Compared with whites, Asians were
less likely to experience sepsis-related death (RR = 0.78, 95%
CI = 0.77 to 0.78), while Blacks (RR = 2.24, 95% CI = 2.23
to 2.24), American Indians/Alaska Natives (RR = 1.24, 95%
CI = 1.24 to 1.25) and Hispanics (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.13
to 1.14) were more likely than whites to experience sepsis-
related death.
Although blacks had the highest rates of sepsis-associated
death of all the groups, they also had the sharpest decline in
annual age-adjusted sepsis mortality, which fell from 105.97
deaths per 100,000 persons in 1999 (95% CI = 104.64 to
107.30) to 97.00 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2005 (95%
CI = 95.81 to 98.20) corresponding to a decline of 1.60% per
year (P < 0.0001). Sepsis-related mortality rates also fell
among Asians (1.34% per year, P < 0.01), Hispanics (1.00%
per year, P < 0.01) and American Indians/Alaska Natives
(0.40% per year, P = 0.54), although the trend was not signif-
icant in American Indians/Alaska Natives. Sepsis-related mor-
tality increased among whites by 0.20% annual during the
study period (P < 0.01).
Table 2 shows that young children and the elderly experienced
the greatest burden of sepsis-related death. The age-specific
rate-ratios for sepsis death in racial/ethnic groups are illus-
trated in Figure 1. Relative to whites, blacks had an increased
likelihood for sepsis-associated death at all ages, but their rel-
ative risk was greatest in the 35 to 44 years and 45 to 54 years
age groups. A similar pattern emerged among American Indi-
ans/Alaska Natives. Relative to whites, Asians were more likely
to experience sepsis-related death in childhood and adoles-
cence, and less likely during adulthood and older-age. Hispan-
ics were approximately 20% more likely than whites to die of
sepsis-related causes across all age groups.
Discussion
We found that 6% of all deaths in the United States from 1999
to 2005 were sepsis related. Of the sepsis-associated deaths
identified in this study, only 22.7% (1.4% of all deaths during
the study period) would be attributed to sepsis using the
underlying-cause-of-death classification. An underlying-cause-
of-death approach to quantifying the burden of sepsis mortal-
ity, as used by the National Center for Health Statistics in its
annual mortality report, may substantially underestimate the
contribution of the syndrome to deaths in the United States

[1]. The MCOD approach is particularly appropriate in the
analysis of sepsis mortality because the vast majority of sepsis
cases occur in elderly individuals and others whose deaths are
the result of multiple co-existing ailments [5,10,12-16].
Rates of sepsis-associated mortality were highest among
blacks and lowest among Asians. Women were less likely to
experience sepsis-related death than men in all race/ethnicity
groups. The large majority of sepsis-related deaths occurred in
hospitals, clinics and medical centres, but the proportion of
death occurring in other settings was significant.
These data confirm previous findings of significant disparities
in sepsis mortality between men and women, and among dif-
ferent races [2,18]. Comparable disparities have frequently
been reported for incidence of sepsis and severe sepsis
[2,4,17-20].
Although several studies have stratified their analysis of sepsis
according to race [4,18-20], there is a paucity of data on sep-
sis-associated mortality rates in Hispanics, American Indians/
Alaska Natives and Asians. Earlier studies found that, relative
to whites, blacks and other non-whites have a higher incidence
of sepsis [4,18-20]. Our data indicates that blacks experience
the highest rates of sepsis-related mortality. However, sepsis-
related mortality for other non-white groups is heterogeneous.
Asians have the lowest rates of all groups including whites.
American Indian/Alaska Natives and Hispanics, on the other
hand, have intermediate rates of sepsis-related mortality.
These differences may reflect distinct rates of incidence and
case fatality in these populations and should be studied sepa-
rately. Our findings may also reflect disparities in access to
health care. Encouragingly, rates of sepsis-associated mortal-
ity exhibited downward trends in all high-risk groups with the
steepest decline for blacks (1.60% per year).
Compared with whites, both American Indians/Alaska Natives
and blacks experienced peak relative risk for sepsis-associ-
ated death in their thirties and forties. A previous study
showed an analogous trend for sepsis incidence among
blacks in New Jersey [18]. Another recent study of multi-state
hospital inpatient data also noted that the rate of sepsis inci-
dence among blacks diverged from whites at a young age
[20]. The comparable rate ratio curves of blacks and American
Indians/Alaska Natives indicate a similar early onset of vulner-
ability for sepsis-related death. The occurrence of parallel pat-
terns of vulnerability in two racially-disparate groups suggests
a possible social mechanism for the disparities. However, it is
likely that genetic as well as social factors underlie racial dis-
parities in sepsis mortality, and further research will be useful
to elucidate such mechanisms. Unfortunately, MCOD data do
not provide indicators of socioeconomic status (such as geo-
graphical or income data) that would allow an investigation of
the relation between such factors and racial disparities in sep-
sis-associated mortality.
Our study indicates that the age-adjusted rate of sepsis mor-
tality exhibited a very slight downward trend, decreasing by
0.18% per year, from 1999 to 2005. This finding contradicts
a study by Dombrovskiy and colleagues which used discharge
data from the Nationwide Inpatients Sample to show a rapid
increase in the incidence and mortality of severe sepsis
between 1993 and 2003 [2]. The investigators found that the
national age-adjusted rate of severe sepsis mortality increased
annually by 5.6% during this period [2]. Although our study
looked at all sepsis-related deaths, while Dombrovskiy and col-
leagues confined their analysis to severe sepsis, this differ-
ence in approaches should not produce conflicting mortality
trends. Most decedents included in our study would be
expected to have experienced severe sepsis even when organ
failure is not listed on the death certificate, because organ fail-
ure is the mechanism by which sepsis causes death. Further-
more, reanalysing the data only for those sepsis-associated
deaths that had a mention of organ failure on their death
record did not alter our findings.
When we restricted our analysis to individuals who were inpa-
tients at the time of their death, and to the period of overlap
between our study and that reported by Dombrovskiy and col-
leagues (1999 to 2003), we found that the rate of sepsis-
associated mortality showed a slight annual increase of 0.16%
(P = 0.01). Although this last result does represent a reversal
of trend, our analyses of all sepsis-associated deaths and of
sepsis-associated deaths occurring in inpatient facilities dem-
onstrate an essentially flat trend from 1999 to 2003.

Interestingly, the crude rate of severe sepsis mortality reported
by Dombrovskiy and colleagues for 2003, the final year of their
study, agreed closely with our own estimate for the same year
(50.8 and 50.7 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively).
However, their estimates for prior years (1999 to 2002) were
all substantially lower than mortality rates indicated by our
data. The contradictory results may reflect increasing sensitiv-
ity in diagnosis and/or coding of severe sepsis in Nationwide
Inpatients Sample data or changes in the attribution and cod-
ing of sepsis on death certificates. In addition the practice of
sampling and weighting may bias estimates based on Nation-
wide Inpatients Sample data. The disagreement in trends war-
rants further investigation and underscores the importance of
consulting multiple data sources for determining disease
burden.
Although our data showed that age-adjusted mortality
decreased very slightly over the study period, crude sepsis-
related mortality exhibited the opposite trend. The slight
decrease in age-adjusted mortality suggests minor improve-
ments in prevention and/or treatment of sepsis. The increasing
crude mortality illustrates that population ageing is, and will
continue to be, a significant driver of sepsis mortality.
Our data confirms earlier findings that men are at increased
risk of sepsis death compared with women, and mirrors previ-
ously reported sex disparities in sepsis incidence
[2,4,5,17,18]. We also found that the effect of sex on suscep-
tibility to sepsis-related death varied by racial group (P <
0.0001). Overall, men were 27% more likely to experience
sepsis-associated death. However, the excess risk for Asian
men was twice as large, while for American Indians/Alaska
Natives being male increased the likelihood of sepsis-related
death by only 7%. The reasons underlying these differences
cannot be ascertained from MCOD data. Genetic and hormo-
nal factors, as well as varying prevalence of comorbid condi-
tions have been implicated in sex-linked disparities in sepsis,
and may all contribute to the pattern of disease observed in
our study [17,33,34].
We found that many of the chronic conditions previously asso-
ciated with sepsis commonly appear on death records which
list sepsis as a cause of death. The frequency with which
comorbidities are seen on death records that cite sepsis as a
cause of death often differs from the reported frequency of
these conditions in incident sepsis cases [4,5,17]. This finding
is not surprising because data from death records do not
reflect all prevalent conditions in decedents [35]. A condition
diagnosed in an individual whose death is sepsis-related
would not appear on the death record if the clinician complet-
ing the certificate were unaware of the diagnosis, or did not
believe the condition to be an important contributor to the
death. The frequency with which sepsis and a particular
comorbidity appear on the same death record does not reflect
the frequency of that comorbidity in sepsis decedents; rather
it reflects the frequency with which that condition acts as a
cause of death when sepsis is also a cause [35].
MCOD data is truly population-based because of the compul-
sory nature of death reporting in the United States. Our find-
ings indicate that 13.1% of sepsis-associated deaths occur in
non-hospital settings. These deaths would not be counted in
studies that rely on hospital discharge databases. In addition
MCOD data is not vulnerable to sampling bias. However,
MCOD data has many limitations characteristic of other
administrative datasets.
We cannot directly assess the accuracy of the data. Misclas-
sification of sepsis-related death can result from errors in diag-
nosis and in the completion of death certificates. Many
physicians do not receive formal training in completing death
certificates and may disagree on the cause of death [36].
Additionally, errors may occur in coding of death certificate
data. As there are no codes for sepsis in ICD-10, we have
used codes for septicaemia as a proxy. Septicaemia codes
have been used to study sepsis in administrative datasets
[2,4,17-19], and Martin and colleagues validated this
approach for ICD-9 codes, showing a positive predictive value
of 97.7% and negative predictive value of 80.0% [4]. As indi-
cated by the relatively low negative predictive value, the use of
septicaemia codes underestimates the burden of sepsis,
probably due to the occurrence of sepsis in patients without
recognised blood-borne infections. As ICD-10 codes have not
been validated for studies of sepsis, our case definition may
produce additional misclassification. In addition to error in the
numbers of sepsis-related death, rates calculated in our study
may also be biased by population estimates. Uncertainty in
denominator values results from error in the census count, and
from the fact that the population structure for intercensal years
is extrapolated [31,32]. An additional limitation in our study is
that causative organisms were recorded on death certificates
of only 7% of decedents. This omission makes it impossible to
reliably assess the relative contribution of various types of
microorganisms to sepsis-associated mortality.
Conclusions
Between 1999 and 2005, sepsis contributed to 6% of all
deaths in the United States. Our study shows that the rapid
rise in sepsis mortality seen in previous decades has slowed,
but that ageing of the United States population continues to
drive growth in the overall burden of sepsis-associated mortal-
ity. Disparities in sepsis-associated mortality mirror those pre-
viously reported for sepsis incidence. However, the age and
sex distribution, as well as rates of sepsis-related death, are
distinct in Asians, Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska
Natives. It is important to study the epidemiology of sepsis in
each of these groups because aggregate measures may
obscure important differences. The trends in sepsis-associ-
ated mortality found in this study contradict reports from pre-
vious investigations and must be confirmed.
