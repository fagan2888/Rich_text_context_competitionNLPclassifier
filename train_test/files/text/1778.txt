IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PREVA-
lence of overweight among chil-
dren increased between 1980 and
2004, and the heaviest children
have been getting heavier.1-4 We
updated the most recent national esti-
mates of the prevalence of high body
mass index (BMI) among US children
and adolescents using data from 2005-
2006. Estimates of high BMI at 3 dif-
ferent levels are presented. In addi-
tion, trends were examined between
1999 and 2006 and racial/ethnic dif-
ferences were evaluated.
METHODS
Data were obtained from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES), a complex, multistage
probability sample of the US civilian,
noninstitutionalized population con-
ductedbytheNationalCenterforHealth
Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC).5
The survey was reviewed and approved
by the NCHS ethics review board, and
participants provided written informed
consent (parental consent for chil-
dren). Height and weight were mea-
sured with standardized protocols and
calibrated equipment during a physical
examination in a mobile examination
center. Body mass index was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height
inmeterssquaredandroundedto1deci-
mal place. Survey participants aged 16
years and older reported their race and
ethnicity.Afamilymemberreportedrace
and ethnicity for children younger than
16 years. Race and ethnicity were re-
portedbyparticipantsbasedonalistthat
included an open-ended response. For
the purposes of this analysis, racial/
ethnic groups were categorized as non-
Hispanicwhite,non-Hispanicblack,and
Mexican American. Sample sizes for
otherracial/ethnicgroupsweretoosmall
for meaningful analysis.
The overall unweighted examination
response rate for children and adoles-
centsinNHANES2005-2006was84.3%,
calculated as the number of examined
children and adolescents divided by the
total number selected into the sample.

lar and have been previously pub-
lished.1-4 Less than 1% of examined chil-
dren had missing data for BMI and were
excluded from the analysis. This report

Context The prevalence of overweight among US children and adolescents in-
creased between 1980 and 2004.
Objectives To estimate the prevalence of 3 measures of high body mass index (BMI)
for age (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and to
examine recent trends for US children and adolescents using national data with mea-
sured heights and weights.
Design, Setting, and Participants Height and weight measurements were ob-
tained from 8165 children and adolescents as part of the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), nationally representa-
tive surveys of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of BMI for age at or above the 97th per-
centile, at or above the 95th percentile, and at or above the 85th percentile of the
2000 sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI-for-age growth
charts among US children by age, sex, and racial/ethnic group.
Results Because no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of high BMI
for age were found between estimates for 2003-2004 and 2005-2006, data for the 4
years were combined to provide more stable estimates for the most recent time pe-
riod. Overall, in 2003-2006, 11.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7%-12.9%) of
children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years were at or above the 97th percen-
tile of the 2000 BMI-for-age growth charts, 16.3% (95% CI, 14.5%-18.1%) were at
or above the 95th percentile, and 31.9% (95% CI, 29.4%-34.4%) were at or above
the 85th percentile. Prevalence estimates varied by age and by racial/ethnic group.
Analyses of the trends in high BMI for age showed no statistically significant trend
over the 4 time periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006) for either
boys or girls (P values between .07 and .41).
Conclusion The prevalence of high BMI for age among children and adolescents
showed no significant changes between 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 and no signifi-
cant trends between 1999 and 2006.

lescents (aged 2-19 years) from 2005-
2006 and 3958 children and adoles-
cents from 2003-2004.
High BMI was defined based on the
2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age growth
charts from the CDC.6 Prevalence esti-
mates are shown based on 3 high BMI-
for-age cut points: at or above the 97th
percentile, at or above the 95th percen-
tile, and at or above the 85th percen-
tile.7-9 Throughout the article, the per-
centiles refer to the reference population
of the 2000 CDC growth charts.
Statistical analyses were done using
SAS (version 9; SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
North Carolina) and SUDAAN (ver-
sion 9; Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, North Caro-
lina). All analyses excluded pregnant
adolescents. Sample weights were used
to account for differential nonre-
sponse and noncoverage and to adjust
for planned oversampling of some
groups. Standard errors were esti-
mated with SUDAAN using Taylor se-
ries linearization.
TrendsinhighBMIforageover4time
periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-
2004, and 2005-2006) were modeled
using logistic regression. Time period

and racial/ethnic group. Because signifi-
cantinteractionswerefoundbetweensex
andracial/ethnicgroup,modelswererun
separately for boys and girls. Trends are
displayedgraphically,andPvaluesbased
on the Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic
are presented in the text.
Differences between estimates from
2003-2004 and 2005-2006 and by sex
in 2003-2006 were tested using t tests
at the .05 significance level control-
ling for multiple comparisons using the
Bonferroni method. Differences by age
and race/ethnicity were tested in logis-
tic regression models using data from
2003-2006.
RESULTS
In 2005-2006, 10.9% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 8.6%-13.2%) of
children and adolescents aged 2
through 19 years were at or above the
97th percentile of the 2000 BMI-for-
age growth charts; 15.5% (95% CI,
12.7%-18.3%) were at or above the 95th
percentile; and 30.1% (95% CI, 26.7%-
33.5%) were at or above the 85th per-
centile of BMI for age.
Analyses of the trends in high BMI
for age showed no statistically signifi-
cant trend over the 4 time periods
(1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004,
and 2005-2006) for either boys or girls
(P values between .07 and .41 for the
6 sex- and BMI-level­specific mod-
els). FIGURES 1, 2, and 3 show the es-
timates of high BMI for age (using the
3 cut points) over the 4 time periods

the estimate of BMI for age at or above
the 95th percentile of the CDC growth
charts decreased from 17.1% to 15.5%
for children and adolescents aged 2
through 19 years, the change was not
statistically significant. None of the es-
timates for non-Hispanic white chil-
dren of BMI for age at or above the 95th
percentile were higher in 2005-2006
thanin2003-2004.Oneestimatewasthe
same while all the others were lower in
2005-2006 compared with 2003-2004,
but the differences were not statisti-
cally significant. Among non-Hispanic
blackorMexicanAmericanchildren,we
did not see this pattern.
Becausenosignificantdifferenceswere
found between 2003-2004 and 2005-
2006, these 2 two-year survey periods
were combined to make detailed popu-
lationestimatesfortheprevalenceofhigh
BMI for age by sex, age, and race/
ethnicity. For 2003-2006, 11.3% (95%
CI, 9.7%-12.9%) of children and adoles-
cents were at or above the 97th percen-
tile of BMI for age from the 2000 CDC
growth charts. For the same period,
16.3% (95% CI, 14.5%-18.1%) of chil-
dren and adolescents had a BMI for age
at or above the 95th percentile of BMI
for age, and 31.9% (95% CI, 29.4%-
34.4%) were at or above the 85th per-
centile. Using 4 years of data, these es-
timates were based on a larger sample
sizeandwerethusmorestablethanthose
from only 2 years of data (TABLE 1).
For each of the 3 cutoffs, high BMI
for age differed significantly by age and
racial/ethnic group but not by sex. Re-
sults from the logistic regression mod-
els indicated that 2- through 5-year-
old boys and girls were significantly less
likely to have a high BMI for age than
12- through 19-year-old adolescents
(TABLE 2). Non-Hispanic black and
Mexican American girls were more
likely to have a high BMI for age than
non-Hispanic white girls. As seen in
Table 1, almost 28% (95% CI, 23.8%-
31.6%) of non-Hispanic black teen girls
aged 12 through 19 years and almost
20% (95% CI, 17.0%-22.8%) of Mexi-
can American teen girls were at or above
the 95th percentile of the 2000 BMI-
for-age growth charts compared with
14.5% (95% CI, 10.4%-18.6%) of non-
Hispanic white girls. A similar pattern
is seen among the adolescents at or
above the 97th percentile; 19.6% (95%
CI, 16.5%-22.7%) of non-Hispanic
black girls and 14.1% (95% CI, 11.4%-
16.8%) of Mexican American girls were
at or above the 97th percentile while
9.1% (95% CI, 5.8%-12.4%) of non-
Hispanic white girls were at or above
the 97th percentile. Among boys, Mexi-
can Americans were significantly more
likely to have high BMI for age than
non-Hispanic white boys. Non-
Hispanic black boys, however, were
only more likely than non-Hispanic
white boys to have high BMI for age at
the highest BMI-for-age level (BMI for
age97th percentile).
COMMENT
No statistically significant trend in high
BMI for age was found over the time pe-
riods 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-
2004, and 2005-2006. Because there
were no significant differences in preva-
lence of high BMI for age between 2003-
2004 and 2005-2006, data for those 4
years were combined to provide more
stable estimates than when using only
2 years of data. For 2003-2006, 11.3%
of children and adolescents were at or
above the 97th percentile of BMI for age
from the 2000 CDC growth charts. For
the same period, 16.3% of children and
adolescents had a BMI for age at or
above the 95th percentile, and 31.9%
were at or above the 85th percentile.
As a sample of the US population, es-
timates from NHANES have some vari-
ability. The trend analysis presented
here includes the most recent data.
Analysis of trends using 4 data points
provides more precise estimates of
trends and sampling error than analy-
sis with 3 data points. Previous analy-
ses of trends with only 3 data points
through 2003-2004 showed a signifi-
cant increase in BMI for age at or above
the 95th percentile over the period
1999-2004 (P=.03 for boys and P=.04
for girls).2 However, the same test for
trends with additional data from 2005-
2006 did not show a significant trend
over the time period 1999-2006 (P=.19
for boys and P=.41 for girls) in BMI for
age at or above the 95th percentile.
Similar to previous analyses of
NHANES data, these results show some
significant differences in high BMI for
age by race/ethnicity, particularly
for girls.1-4 Adiposity levels at differ-

ent BMI-for-age levels, however, may
vary by race/ethnicity.10
In comparison with a general refer-
ence population, the 85th and 95th
percentiles have been used as cut
points for high BMI.7,9 The 97th per-
centile provides an even higher cut
point to identify the heaviest children.
Strictly speaking, obesity refers to
excess body fatness or adiposity and
overweight to total body weight in
excess of a weight standard.11 In prac-
tice, measurement of body fat is diffi-
cult both in clinical applications and
in population studies. In addition,
there are no well-accepted standards
for body fatness for children. Thus, in
general, weight adjusted for height is
used rather than a more direct mea-
sure of body fat. A variety of methods
have been used to adjust weight for
height, but currently the most com-
mon, both for children and for adults,
is BMI.12 For children, BMI varies con-
siderably with age, so generally the
BMI of a child is compared with the
BMI of a reference population of chil-
dren of the same sex and age. A vari-
ety of reference data sets exist for BMI
in childhood. There is no standard
definition of adiposity or excess body
fat in childhood against which given
BMI levels can be compared.
The 2000 CDC BMI-for-age growth
charts are often used in the United
States to screen for overweight. These
charts were constructed from refer-
ence population samples of US chil-
dren in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s
(and early 1990s for children younger
than 6 years).6 In the construction of
the 2000 CDC growth charts, selected
percentiles were smoothed with a vari-
ety of methods, but data were too
sparse to estimate percentiles below
the 3rd or above the 97th percentile.
Using a different approach from that
developed by Cole,13 estimates of 3
parameters, L (a skewness parameter),
M (the median), and S (a measure of
variation), were calculated by solving
equations that used the values for the
smoothed percentiles ranging from the
3rd to the 97th. Because percentiles
less than the 3rd or greater than the
97th are beyond the range of the data
from which the LMS values were esti-
mated, "extrapolation beyond this
range should be done with caution."6
Consequently, we present estimates of
high BMI for age based on the 97th
percentile.
The increase in the prevalence of high
BMI for age among US children that was
previously seen between NHANES III
(1988-1994) and NHANES 2003-
2004 was not observed between 2003-
2004 and 2005-2006. Even at the high-
est BMI for age level, no change in
prevalence was found between 2003-
2004 and 2005-2006, either overall or
by racial/ethnic group. Data from 2007-
2008 are needed to further examine the
trends.
