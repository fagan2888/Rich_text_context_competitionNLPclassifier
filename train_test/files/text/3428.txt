Empirical Ethics
Is imperfection becoming easier
to live with for doctors?
Reidun Førde1 and Olaf G Aasland2
Abstract
Objective: Being involved in serious patient injury is devastating for most doctors. During the last two decades, several
efforts have been launched to improve Norwegian doctors' coping with adverse events and complaints.
Methods: The method involved survey to a representative sample of 1792 Norwegian doctors in 2012. The questions
on adverse events and its effects were previously asked in 2000.
Results: Response rate was 71%. More doctors reported to have been involved in episodes with serious patient harm in
2012 (35%) than in 2000 (28%), and more of the episodes were reported as required by law. Doctors below age 50
report better support from colleagues, more collegial retrospective discussion on the event and less patient/family blame.
In all, 27% of the doctors had been reported to the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision; 79% of these complaints
were rejected; 73% of the doctors who had received a reaction from the health authorities found the reaction reason-
able, but almost one out of five practiced more testing and referrals after a complaint and 25% claimed that the complaint
had made them into a more fearful doctor.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that adverse events are being met more openly in 2012 than in 2000, and that coping
with imperfection and patient complaints is less devastating for new generations of doctors.

Introduction
Although patient injury does not necessarily imply neg-
ligence, being involved in serious patient injury and
causing unintended suffering for the patient is devastat-
ing for most doctors. To decide what is a preventable
adverse event is no easy task. Substandard care may
not necessarily result in patient harm, and serious
outcome may happen in spite of adequate intervention.
Doctors are socialized to strive for error free practice,
and a medical mistake that leads to patient harm has
often been regarded not only as a sign of professional
failure, but also as a failure of character in the respon-
sible physician, with subsequent feelings of guilt and
shame.1­3 Insufficient organizational support and sup-
port from colleagues after such events are frequently
described, possibly augmenting the feeling of guilt
and shame.4 Defensive medical practice and a tendency
to conceal adverse events may result.5,6 Openness about
such events, including disclosure to patients and next of
kin, should be part of the safety culture.7,8 Thus, work
to improve the medical establishment's ability to deal
with unwanted patient outcomes in an open way and to
include support to all involved parties after an adverse
event may be seen as one way of strengthening patient
rights in health care.
A Norwegian study from 2000 revealed that many
doctors working within the surgical disciplines, includ-
ing anaesthesiology and gynaecology/obstetrics, had
been involved in adverse events with serious patient
injury. However, only 37% of the incidents were
reported to the health authorities, which is obligatory,
and only 68% informed the patient's family after the
incidence.9 One out of five doctors did not experience
any support from colleagues after the incident. Several
of the doctors in this study reported that the incident
had influenced their private life and had made it more
difficult to work as a doctor afterwards.

A shift in policy
Since 2000, the medical community has gradually
seen medical mistakes more as system errors than
individual incompetence. This change may hopefully
lead to increased willingness to report the adverse
event,10,11 to improved routines to meeting the
patient and next of kin after the event and to
better routines to support the responsible health
care personnel after the event.12
In Norway, several initiatives towards increased
openness after adverse events in medical practice have
taken place. At the University of Oslo, medical students
are offered a 2-day course towards the end of their
studies to increase their knowledge of how adverse
events should be met, professionally, legally and ethic-
ally. A new section in The Health Directorate has been
created where anonymized descriptions of serious
events that have led to, or could have led to, serious
patient harm are reported and processed.13 In addition,
health care personnel must, according to the Specialist
Care Act § 3-3a, report every incident with serious
patient injury to The Norwegian Board of Health
Supervision and to notify patients in cases of unex-
pected negative or unwanted outcome of health care
interventions.14
The complaint system
When the outcome of a medical intervention is subopti-
mal or when patient expectations are not met, the
responsible health care personnel may experience a
complaint put forward to the health authorities. In
Norway, filing complaints is now formalized in The
Patient- and Users Right law §7-4.15 The health autho-
rities receive complaints on health care personnel
through two channels. Less serious complaints are
filed to the County Governor (Fylkesmannen), who
may give guidance or propose deliberations between
the parties. More serious cases are referred to The
Norwegian Board of Health Supervision who processes
the complaints with one of three possible outcomes:
rejection of the complaint, issuing a warning to the
health care personnel or suspending the authorization
for a number of years, or permanently. Thus the doc-
tors who experience a reaction have all been involved in
more serious events. Even if Norway, since 1988, has
had a no blame compensation system after patient
injury,16 a complaint is normally perceived as deeply
disturbing for doctors.17
With increased emphasis on patient rights, it is likely
that the number of doctors experiencing a complaint
will increase, and with this follows hopefully a need
for health care personnel to regard complaints as
(albeit unwanted) part of professional life and thus
experiencing them as less devastating.
The aim of the present study was to explore the
change over time in doctors' coping with serious patient
harm, and to study how doctors react to and cope with
complaints to the health authorities.
Methods
Since 1992, The Norwegian Medical Association, orga-
nising more than 90% of all doctors practising in
Norway, has sponsored its own research institute with
the main objective to study the health and behaviour of
doctors. See www.legeforsk.org for an overview of the
publications. An important element of this effort has
been to follow a representative panel of approximately
1700 doctors with postal questionnaires. The panel is
unbalanced, meaning that new young doctors are regu-
larly added and retired or deceased doctors are
removed.
Specialist categories
There are 45 medical specialties and subspecialties in
Norway, and for the purpose of optimal statistical ana-
lyses, the specialties are grouped into larger logical enti-
ties. In this study, we use the following seven categories:
family medicine/general practice, laboratory/service
specialties, internal medicine specialties (including
oncologists), surgical specialties, anaesthesiology and
intensive care, psychiatry and community medicine/
public health. Specialists in training are categorized
according to their future specialty.
Questions
In November 2012, a postal questionnaire was sent to
the 1792 panel members, with three reminders. The
questionnaire covered several broad topics such as
knowledge of and attitudes towards guidelines, priority
setting issues and end of life dilemmas.
This article is based on the response to questions on
adverse events and their consequences, which are simi-
lar to the questions posed in the survey of 2000: `Have
you experienced serious patient injury in connection
with medical treatment you have given?' response alter-
natives: never, a few times/several times/not applicable.
The question was followed by eight questions about
potential consequences on the part of the doctor (list
is provided in Table 2), with response alternatives yes/
no/uncertain.
In addition, we asked whether they had been
involved in a complaint to the health authorities, fol-
lowed by a question about The Board's conclusion, and
11 possible consequences of this, including an evalu-
ation of whether they regarded the Board's reaction
as fair and reasonable (Table 3).

Statistical analyses
Responses are reported as frequencies across three
group variables: gender (female and male), age (30­
49, 50þ) and specialty (general practice, laboratory/ser-
vice, anaesthesiology/intensive care, internal, surgical,
psychiatry and public health). Where appropriate, the
observation of possible overlap between 95% confi-
dence intervals are used to identify statistically signifi-
cant differences between groups.
Ethics. The regional ethics committee has given the
Norwegian physician study exemption from ethics
approval (Ref IRB 0000 1870), based on the fact that
no patients are involved in the studies.
Results
In all, 1279 questionnaires were returned, a response
rate of 71%.
Involved in patient injury
Thirty-five percent of the doctors reported that they
had been involved in serious patient injury. The two
highest groups were doctors in surgical specialties
51% (43­60%) and anaesthesiology 45% (32­59%).
This was significantly higher than other specialty
groups (Table 1). Thirty-three percent (29­38%) of all
doctors below the age of 50 reported such an experience
compared to 42% (CI: 38­46%) of doctors 50 years
and over.
In 2012, 35% (32­38%) of the doctors reported to
have been involved in incidents with patient harm, com-
pared with 28% (26­31%) in 2000.
Further, 51% (46­56%) of the incidents reported
in 2012 had been reported to The Board of Health,
compared to 37% (32­42%) in 2000 (Table 2).
Likewise, 75% of the doctors who had experienced
patient injury reported in 2012 that they had received
personal support from colleagues after the incident,
compared to 70% in 2000, and fewer doctors reported
that the incident had had negative consequences
for their private life than in 2000: 12% vs 18%.
Also, 7% reported in 2012 that the incident has
made it more difficult for them to work as a doctor,
compared to 12% in 2000. Although none of these
differences are statistically significant, together they
suggest a trend towards less negative consequences for
the doctors.
Eighty-nine percent (85­93%) of the respondents
below the age of 50 reported that the incident was dis-
cussed at their workplace, compared with 80% (75­
85%) of the doctors 50 years and older. Likewise,
87% (82­91%) of the doctors below 50 reported good
support from their colleagues after the incident, as
opposed to 79% (74­85%) of the doctors over 50.
Also, fewer of the doctors below age 50 reported
having been blamed by the patient/next of kin after
the incident: 33% (27­38%) vs 45% (38­51%).
Complaints to the health authorities
Twenty-seven percent of the doctors had been reported
to The Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, 48%
of the family doctors/G.Ps, 33% of the psychiatrists,
23% of the anaesthesiologists and 21% of the surgeons.
Thirty-six percent (31­40%) of the doctors who had
been involved in serious patient injury had also been
reported to The Board of Health, as opposed to 23%
(20­26%) of those who did not have such experience.
Seventy-nine percent of the complaints resulted in a
rejection of the complaint without further reaction.
Other reactions were warnings (13%) and other sanc-
tions (5%), usually suspension of authorisation. Three
percent were still waiting for their decision.
Seventy-three percent of the doctors who had
received a reaction felt that the reaction was reason-
able/fair.
Table 3 shows the reported positive and negative
impacts on the complainees. Sixty-two percent reported
that they had become more thorough with their docu-
mentation, and 44% reported that the complaint had
resulted in their giving better information to patients/
next of kin. Among negative effects were loss of trust in
patients/next of kin and negative influence on the doc-
tor's private life. Seventeen percent reported that the

Discussion
Our results must be interpreted with caution. Brief
answers and fixed response categories seldom capture
the nuances of complex experiences and emotions. We
asked whether the doctors had ever been involved in
incidents of serious patient injury. The answer is subject
to recall bias.
Because we wanted to explore how doctors react
when they are involved in interventions that end up
with serious patient injury, we have not included ques-
tions about the cause of injury, whether it was a result of
an explicit error or just a result of a complicated and
risky intervention. It is likely that a negative outcome
which is caused by obvious errors may be the most dif-
ficult to deal with for the responsible physician.
Accordingly, they may need more guidance and support.
One strength of the study is that we can compare the
2012-responses with data from 2000, and show changes
in the reporting of patient injury and in how incidents
were experienced and followed up. We were also able to
find how a complaint to the health authorities may have
influenced doctors, which was not possible with the
2000 data.
In 2012, more doctors than in 2000 reported having
been involved in serious patient injury. This may indi-
cate more openness; but also that medical interventions
are more complicated and risky, in spite of all attempts
to increase patient safety. As in 2000, doctors in inter-
vention intensive specialties like surgery and anaesthe-
siology are more often involved in serious patient harm.
As to the follow up of adverse events, we see a ten-
dency towards more openness in that the incidents are
more often reported to the health authorities in line
with legal requirements. Also, the doctors experience
more support from colleagues after the event and less
emotional stress with impact on private and profes-
sional life. Since the numbers are small, the effects are
not statistically significant, but we still see a positive
development in most of our items. In 16% of the inci-
dents, the event was still not discussed at the workplace.
This is not satisfactory and underlines the need to con-
tinued efforts to change attitudes in the medical culture
towards more openness regarding adverse events.
However, it is encouraging that the younger doctors
more often report collegial support after an event,
more often discuss the event at the working place and

less frequently have been blamed by the patient/next of
kin. This may indicate that a new generation of doctors
is practicing better coping strategies after serious events.
Being reported to the health authorities
Only 36% of the doctors involved in patient harm have
experienced a complaint to the health authorities, com-
pared with 23% of the rest, which means that serious
patient injury does not necessarily result in a complaint
to the health authorities. This is in line with a study
from New Zealand where only a minority of serious
adverse events resulted in complaints.18 A Norwegian
study found that only around 10% of patients who
have experienced an adverse event filed a complaint.18
A study from the US found that even in adverse events
caused by negligence only a minority filed malpractice
claims.20 If the patient/next of kin are met with open-
ness and honest regret in an empathic way after the
incident this may reduce the need to `punish' the
doctor.6
It is interesting to note that G.P.s/family practi-
tioners and psychiatrists are overrepresented among
the doctors who experience complaints, perhaps indi-
cating that many complaints are generated by problems
with communication and a suboptimal doctor ­
patient/next of kin relationship rather than serious
somatic injury. Also, G.P.s see more patients during a
working week than most other specialists. G.Ps are
overrepresented in a New Zealand study of medical
complaints as well.21 In Norway, the GP has a gate-
keeping role, and setting medically sound limits to
patients' quests for tests and interventions may cause
frustration and possible complaints. Norwegian
patients' reporting of adverse events tends to place
the responsibility for the event on their GP.19
The health authorities reject three out of four com-
plaints. Still one in eight doctors report that the com-
plaint has made it more difficult to work as a doctor
(Table 3). We find it noteworthy, however, that 73% of
the doctors who did receive a reaction, typically a warn-
ing, found the authorities' decision reasonable. This
may be another indication of contemporary
Norwegian doctors accepting patient complaints as
part of their professional life. The same goes for
having become more thorough with patient informa-
tion, and in clinical work generally. A Norwegian
study from 1993 indicated that having experienced
complaints did not influence decision-making, while
being threatened with reporting or negative exposure
in the media did.21 More meticulous documentation
may be seen as a defensive, time consuming and
stress-generating obligation rather than a sign of
improved patient safety. Thus, 17% also report that
they perform more tests and make more referrals
after the incident, and 11% report a less trusting rela-
tionship to patients/next of kin. Kessler et al. found
defensive medicine as an effect of the medical liability
systems in Australia, UK and the USA.23 We have
reason to believe that increased collegial support and
a scrutiny of what exactly happened may reduce these
negative effects of the complaint.12 Accordingly, not
only adverse events but also patient complaints
should be met with openness and collegial scrutiny,
including ethical and relational considerations.16,24
A recent report on serious events in the health and
care services stresses the importance of health personnel
opening up for scrutiny of professional practice.24 Our
findings are consistent with these societal expectations.25
Conclusion
Increased openness towards health care that results in
patient injury is important to meet patients and next of
kin adequately. More doctors reported having been
involved in adverse events with serious patient harm in
2012thanin 2000, and moreof the incidentswerereported
to The Board of Health. Doctors below the age of 50
describe better follow up of the incident at their workplace
compared with their older colleagues. Our study indicates
that efforts to improve follow up of intervention causing
serious patient injury has given positive results.
Only a minority of the doctors having been involved
in episodes with patient harm had experienced a com-
plaint. General practitioners and psychiatrists were
overrepresented among the doctors who had experi-
enced a complaint. A majority of the doctors who
had received a formal reaction from the health autho-
rities found the reaction reasonable.
Being involved in a patient complaint to the health
authorities may be emotionally stressful for doctors.
Many complaints may be caused by suboptimal com-
munication and poor doctor­patient relationships. In
order to learn and improve practice, it is important to
scrutinize episodes of patient complaints and to offer
collegial support to the doctors involved.
