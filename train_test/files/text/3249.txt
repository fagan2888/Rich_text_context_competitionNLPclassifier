Non-technical summary
Research question
How can parameter uncertainty be taken into account in the evaluation of quantita-
tive easing (QE) with accompanying forward guidance (FG)? Studies that assess
the macroeconomic effects of QE with accompanying FG typically provide only
point estimates. The uncertainty about parameter estimates is usually ignored. A
potential reason is the two-step-approach that is generally taken in the literature
when QE and FG, technically implemented by an anticipated temporary interest
rate peg, are considered. In a first step, a model capable of predicting real effects
of a QE programme and with a standard feedback rule for the policy rate is esti-
mated. In a second step, given the estimated parameters, scenario analyses for QE
with an anticipated interest rate peg are carried out. The uncertainty about the
parameter estimates is usually neglected going from the first to the second step.
Contribution
We use prior and posterior predictive analysis to evaluate parameter uncertainty in
the analysis of the Eurosystem's PSPP and FG. Prior-posterior predictive analysis
provides an easy-to-implement way to evaluate parameter uncertainty in the con-
text of a policy scenario for QE which involves solving a non-linear DSGE model
while simultaneously considering a credibly announced interest rate peg.
Results
The uncertainty about the effects of the PSPP is considerable and it increases
substantially when the PSPP is accompanied by FG modelled as a temporary
interest rate peg. The Calvo parameters, i.e. the probabilities of being able to
reset prices and wages, are the most important factors driving uncertainty about
inflation. In contrast, variations in the financial friction parameter have little
impact on inflation outcomes and hence uncertainty.

Uncertainty about QE effects when an interest
rate peg is anticipated

Abstract
After hitting the lower bound on interest rates, the Eurosystem engaged
in a public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and forward guidance (FG).
We use prior and posterior predictive analysis to evaluate the importance
of parameter uncertainty in an analysis of these policies. We model FG as
an anticipated temporary interest rate peg. The degree of parameter uncer-
tainty is considerable and increasing in the length of FG. The probability of
being able to reset prices and wages is the most important factor driving un-
certainty about inflation. In contrast, variations in financial intermediaries'
net worth adjustment costs have little impact on inflation outcomes.

Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 12/2018
1 Introduction
In recent years, many central banks have resorted to quantitative easing policies
(QE) to provide economic stimulus at the effective lower interest rate bound. Typi-
cally, QE has been accompanied by a special type of forward guidance (FG) where
central banks provide (additional) stimulus by communicating that policy rates
will be kept constant for an extended period of time. Hence, there are two policies
influencing the economy at the same time.
Most studies that evaluate the macroeconomic effects of QE programmes ­ such
as the Federal Reserve's large scale asset purchase programmes (LSAPs) or the
Eurosystem's public sector purchase programme (PSPP) ­ in tandem with FG
provide only point estimates of these effects (see, inter alia, Gertler and Karadi,
2013; Andrade, Breckenfelder, Fiore, Karadi and Tristani, 2016; Sahuc, 2016; K¨
uhl,
2016; Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2017; Hohberger, Priftis and Vogel, 2017).
One potential reason for this observation is the two-step-approach that is usually
taken in the literature. In a first step, a model capable of generating real effects of
QE and with a standard feedback rule for the policy rate is estimated (typically
via Bayesian estimation of the underlying DSGE model). In a second step, given
these estimates for the structural parameters, scenario analyses of QE in tandem
with FG ­ technically implemented by an anticipated interest rate peg ­ are carried
out.1 The uncertainty surrounding the parameter estimates is usually neglected
going from the first to the second step, as standard software tools to illustrate
parameter uncertainty in such scenario analyses are not readily available.2
1In the following, we use the terms FG and anticipated interest rate peg interchangeably.
2There are three possible sources of uncertainty in this type of analysis. First, across model
uncertainty ­ implying that the choice of the model for evaluating QE has an impact on the
1
In this paper, we provide an easy-to-implement way to analyse parameter uncer-
tainty for scenario analyses involving QE in tandem with FG. In particular, after
estimating parameters of (a linear version of) a model with Bayesian methods,
we conduct prior and posterior predictive analysis to use the information about
the parameter estimation obtained in the first step for the subsequent policy sce-
nario analysis in the second step. We thus follow Leeper, Traum and Walker
(2015) and Suh and Walker (2016) who use prior-posterior predictive analysis to
asses specific quantitative properties of DSGE models. These authors implement
predictive analysis for linearised models, which are solved and simulated using
standard (first-order) perturbation techniques. We show that it is possible to ex-
ploit this technique in order to describe parameter uncertainty in the evaluation
of QE accompanied by FG. The scenario analysis of QE in tandem with FG in our
case is based on a non-linear DSGE model.
The model we use for our analysis is the one in Carlstrom et al. (2017) (henceforth
CFP). We estimate the model with European data and subsequently simulate
time paths for inflation in response to the launch of a QE programme for four
different policy scenarios: In the first scenario, a QE programme that mimics
the Eurosystem's PSPP affects the economy. In the second, third, and fourth
scenario, the same QE programme again affects the economy but is additionally
accompanied by one, two, and three years of FG, respectively. Our simulated time
simulation results ­ which is often illustrated by a simple comparison of median estimates of a
large number of different studies (see, for instance, the meta-studies provided by International
Monetary Fund, 2013; Deutsche Bundesbank, 2016). Second, within model uncertainty (i.e.
parameter uncertainty) implying that uncertainty about estimates for the structural parameters
of the underlying model will also translate into uncertainty about the estimated macroeconomic
effects for a given purchase programme (the case we deal with in this paper). Third, data
uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty about the information content present in collected data).
2
paths imply a distribution of the inflation response to a QE programme which
highlights the relevance of parameter uncertainty in the assessment of QE. The
prior-predictive analysis produces distributions for inflation based on the prior
distributions of the estimated model parameters, while the posterior-predictive
analysis is based on the distributions of the estimated parameters after having
confronted the model with the data. This allows us to assess what effect on the
distribution of the inflation response the data assign to the PSPP and FG within
our model framework. It is easily possible to conduct the same type of analysis
also with respect to other macroeconomic variables. We confine ourselves to the
analysis of the inflation effects, though, to keep the analysis focused.
In principle, there are other methods of illustrating uncertainty in the evaluation of
QE programmes. However, they are not applicable to the scenario we have in mind,
namely the evaluation of a QE programme accompanied by FG, implemented as
an anticipated interest rate peg. For example, Bayesian impulse response func-
tions principally allow for an evaluation of parameter uncertainty when analysing
QE (at least if the QE shock is part of the estimation), but they are not readily
available if there is a temporary anticipated interest rate peg. Another example
is the computation of conditional forecasts which principally allows for the illus-
tration of uncertainty in the analysis of QE in combination with an interest rate
peg. This method, however, involves implementing the peg by finding a series of
shocks that imply a pre-specified path for the interest rate (based on the state
space solution of the underlying DSGE model). These shocks are by definition
unexpected, that is, agents are not able to anticipate the temporary interest rate
peg ­ which contradicts the very idea of FG. If agents are supposed to anticipate
3
the temporary nominal interest rate peg, this necessitates implementing the peg
via anticipated (or news) shocks as in K¨
uhl (2016) or solving and simulating the
model by, for instance, assuming perfect foresight as in Sahuc (2016), neither of
whom considers parameter uncertainty.
In this paper, we take the perfect foresight approach to implement the anticipated
temporary interest rate peg and contribute to the literature by illustrating param-
eter uncertainty employing prior and posterior predictive analysis, and identifying
the individual contributions of the different parameters to this uncertainty. We find
that the uncertainty about the effects of the PSPP is considerable and amplified
when the PSPP is accompanied by FG. The Calvo parameters ­ which govern the
probability, in a given period, of being able to reset prices and wages ­ have, for a
given length of FG, the biggest influence in determining the uncertainty about the
inflation effects of a QE shock. The estimated financial friction parameter ­ which
is of crucial importance in the model for QE to have real effects (see Carlstrom
et al., 2017) ­ is of less importance regarding parameter uncertainty.
We organise our paper as follows. The next section presents the model. Section 3
provides details of the model's estimation and calibration. Section 4 describes how
QE and FG are implemented. Section 5 describes the prior-posterior predictive
analysis we conduct and shows the resulting simulations of inflation for our different
policy scenarios. It also contains an analysis about which parameters are most
important for our results. Section 6 concludes.

2 Model
In the standard New Keynesian model, asset purchases are neutral (so-called Wal-
lace neutrality), in that they do not have an effect on real economic activity and
inflation (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003). To simulate the effects of QE and
to compute the corresponding uncertainty of these effects, we therefore rely on a
DSGE model developed by CFP which features funding constraints and market
segmentation such that the Wallace neutrality does not apply. More precisely,
in this model both households and financial intermediaries (henceforth FIs) face
financial constraints. The bond market is segmented in that only FIs can pur-
chase long-term debt instruments. These include public (i.e. government) and
private (i.e. investment) bonds. From the perspective of the FIs, these are per-
fect substitutes and, hence, yield the same returns. However, the ability of the
FIs to adjust their liability position is limited by two constraints. First, they
are leverage-constrained because the amount of deposits they can attract is con-
strained by their net worth (due to a hold-up problem). Second, FIs face net
worth adjustment costs. Households need to finance their investments by way of
issuing (long-term) investment bonds and, thus, face a funding restriction with re-
spect to their investments (a so-called loan-in-advance constraint). The purchase
of government bonds increases the FIs' demand for investment bonds since the lia-
bility side of the FIs balance sheet cannot adjust easily due to the aforementioned
constraints. This in turn alleviates the households' loan-in-advance-constraint.
Otherwise, the model exhibits familiar New Keynesian features. That is, it com-
prises households that consume, save in (short-term) deposits and supply labour,
a standard production sector with monopolistic competition in intermediate good
5
production, price and wage rigidities (see Erceg, Henderson and Levin, 2000) as
well as price and wage indexation (see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 2005).
If the central bank abstains from forward guidance, it follows a standard Taylor
rule with some degree of interest rate smoothing. The non-linear model equations
are summarised in Table 1, and a complete derivation of the model is delegated to
Appendix A.

3 Estimation and Calibration
As is common in the literature, we calibrate a subset of structural parameters
to ensure identification. For the calibration, we rely on CFP. Table 2 gives the
values for the calibrated parameters.  is set to 0.99, yielding a steady state
annual real interest rate of 4%. The labour income share  is set to 0.33 and the
capital depreciation rate per year to 10%, implying  = 0.025. A 20% mark-up
in both prices and wages is assumed, leading to p
= w
= 5. A leverage ratio
of 6 leads to  = 0.9854. The other structural parameters are estimated using
Bayesian methods. For the estimation, we linearise the model around the steady
state. We use eight observables for the euro area: real per capita output growth,
real per capita investment growth, gross inflation, employment growth, real wage

Bank's MFI Balance Sheet Items Statistics. All the other variables are taken from
the Area-wide Model database.3 A description of the data is provided in Appendix
B. All variables are demeaned. Since we have only seven structural shocks in the
model, we add a measurement error to the observations equation for bank net
worth in order to avoid stochastic singularity.4 The sample period is from 1998Q1
to 2013Q4.

Notes: Results based on 4 chains with 500,000 draws each. HPD inf and HPD sup denote the lower and upper
bound, respectively, of the 90% highest posterior density interval.
The choice of the prior distributions of the structural parameters to be estimated
correspond largely to those in CFP and Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2010).
In general, we use the Beta distribution for parameters between zero and one. For
the Taylor rule parameters we use the normal distribution, which is typically used
for unbounded parameters. For the financial sector parameter N
, which governs
the importance of net worth adjustment costs, we use a gamma distribution with
mean 3 and standard deviation 1. The left parts of Tables 3 and 4 display the
prior distributions of the estimated parameters.
Given the prior distributions of the parameters, we draw posterior distributions
using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We run four chains, each with 500,000
draws.5 The right parts of Tables 3 and 4 report the posterior median, the poste-
rior mean, and the lower and upper bounds of the 90% highest posterior density
5We use Dynare 4.5.4 for the estimation of the model, see Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard,

rithm. Convergence statistics proposed by Brooks and Gelman (1998) as well as
trace plots for the estimated structural parameters are presented in Appendix D.
The posterior means of the habit formation parameter (0.86), the price rigidity
parameter (0.81), and the price indexation parameter (0.53) are estimated to be
somewhat higher than in CFP. The posterior means of the wage rigidity (0.82),
wage indexation (0.38), and labour disutility (1.85) parameter are estimated to be
somewhat lower than in CFP. The posterior means of the Taylor rule parameters
10
are in line with commonly observed values in the literature. The most noticeable
difference between our estimation result and CFP's is the posterior distribution
for the net worth adjustment cost parameter N
. Our posterior mean for this
parameter (6.82) is vastly higher than the one in CFP (0.79). This could have
several reasons: First, net worth elasticity could be different in Europe compared
to the USA. Second, our sample ends in 2013Q4 and thus includes data of the
financial crisis. Third, we use data on bank net worth to better identify the net
worth adjustment cost parameter. On average, financial frictions could thus be
more severe in our sample than in CFP's sample which ends in 2008Q4. Figure 1
shows the prior and posterior distributions of the structural parameters as well as
their posterior modes.

We implement the PSPP of the Eurosystem using an AR(2) process for the real
market value of long-term bonds on the balance sheets of the FIs:

Once triggered, the entire path of the PSPP is taken into account (and, thus,

purchases of e60 billion euro from March 2015 until September 2016, as announced
by the Governing Council in January 2015.6 This approximately implies an about

5 Prior-posterior predictive analysis
Based on our estimation, we use prior and posterior predictive analysis to gener-
ate the respective distributions of inflation responses for different policy scenarios.
In the first scenario we do not constrain the interest rate path and describe the

model's range of predictions in response to QE. The unconstrained nature of the
interest rate in this scenario implies that it increases in response to the inflation-
ary stimulus of the QE programme according to the Taylor rule. In the second,
third and fourth scenario, we analyse the model's range of predictions if the QE
programme is accompanied by a one, two, and three year lasting anticipated inter-
est rate peg, respectively. After the peg, the interest rate varies according to the
estimated Taylor rule.
We implement prior predictive analysis in the following way. Given the DSGE
model outlined in section 2, we posit prior densities for the model's structural
parameters, where we restrict our analysis to the parameter subspace that implies
a unique rational expectations equilibrium. We then simulate 100.000 sets of draws
for the structural parameters based on the prior distributions specified in Table
3.8 Then, based on these draws, we calculate perfect foresight simulations for each
policy scenario. In this way, the prior predictive analysis produces a distribution
of inflation effects for each policy scenario and, thus, a range of possible model-
implied responses to the policy impact before confronting the model with actual
data.
We use posterior predictive analysis to analyse the model-implied responses after
having confronted the model with our data set. The posterior means/medians
shown in Table 3 are based on the posterior distributions, which have been gener-
ated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm during the estimation of the model.
We simulate 500.000 sets of draws for the posterior distributions. Based on these
8To generate these draws we make use of the Global Sensitivity Analysis toolbox developed
by Ratto (2008).

draws we calculate 100.000 perfect foresight simulations for each policy scenario.9
In this way, we produce a range of possible inflation responses for the four policy
scenarios after the information content in the actual data has been exploited.10
5.1 Baseline results
Our first set of results, shown in Figure 3, refers to the policy scenario in which the
central bank implements a QE programme without an interest rate peg. Conse-
quently, in response to inflationary pressures the central bank increases its policy
rate (not shown) according to the Taylor rule specified in (2), with TR
t
= 0 t.
The left-hand panel (red fan charts) shows the distribution of the inflation path for
the prior predictive analysis. The black line represents the median inflation path.
The simulations result in a median peak response of inflation of 0.34 percentage
points (pp) five quarters after the implementation of the QE programme. The
uncertainty of the macroeconomic effects is highlighted by the 66 percent interval
of the overall distribution of the simulations. The different shadings represent 5.¯
5%
percentiles. At the peak response, the interval exhibits a range of 0.20 pp for the
effect of the PSPP on inflation. Thus, a priori, the model is able to generate notable
effects of the PSPP, but the parameter uncertainty of the effects is pronounced.
The right-hand panel (green fan charts) in Figure 3 shows the distribution of
9To be precise, we take the last 100.000 out of the 500.000 sets to make sure that we only use
posterior draws from the MCMC simulations that have converged.
10Note that when we analyse the inflation effects of QE in combination with FG, some draws
(which still deliver unique rational expectations equilibria) imply sign switches in the simulations
of the endogenous variables. This phenomenon has become known as the reversal puzzle (see
Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2015; Gerke, Giesen, Kienzler and Tenhofen, 2017). Here, we
follow Lind´
e, Smets and Wouters (2016) and constrain our analysis to those cases in which the
reversal puzzle does not arise (for both the prior and the posterior predictive analysis).

inflation paths for the posterior predictive analysis. The median peak response
of inflation is 0.42 pp, and at the peak response, the interval exhibits a range of
0.15 pp. Hence, after confronting the model with the data, it suggests a higher
median effect of the PSPP on inflation. Furthermore, as the distributional mass is
more centred around the median, the posterior distributions imply a lower degree
of parameter uncertainty about these effects. This may, however, not come as a
surprise as the prior distributions were chosen to be fairly broad and accordingly
the posterior distributions tend to be narrower (see Figure 1), leading to a sizeable
share of the distributional mass to be close to the median response.
Figure 4 shows the simulation results for the scenarios in which QE is accompanied
by FG. Rows one, two, and three correspond to one, two, and three years of FG,
respectively. The left-hand panels (red fan charts) show the results of the prior
predictive analyses, while the right-hand panels (green fan charts) show the results
15
for the posterior predictive analyses. Looking at the prior predictive analysis for
a QE programme accompanied by one year of FG (upper left graph), the median
response increases strongly compared to the scenario without FG. The median
peak effect is 2.62 pp, approximately seven times larger than the median peak
effect without FG. In addition, a large share of the distributional mass now implies
responses which are multitudes larger than in the scenario without FG. At the
peak, the interval exhibits a range of 6.52 pp.
The observation that even rather short periods of FG produce such large effects
of inflation in New-Keynesian-type models such as those seen in Figure 4 seems
unrealistic and has become known as the FG puzzle in the literature (see Del Negro,
Giannoni and Patterson, 2015). Hence, here we replicate the expected result that
the median peak inflation response increases strongly with FG and accordingly the
distribution of the inflation paths widens.11
The upper right graph in Figure 4 shows the posterior predictive analysis for a
QE programme accompanied by one year of FG. It shows that the median peak
response of inflation increases (to 0.81 pp) and the range of the distribution at the
peak widens (to 0.48 pp) compared to the posterior predictive analysis without
FG, as expected. However, this increase in inflation responses going from zero to
one year of FG is not nearly as sharp as in the prior predictive analysis. It thus
seems that the FG puzzle is less evident for the posterior predictive analysis. The
difference between prior and posterior predictive analysis, however, loses impor-
tance for longer durations of FG, although the prior predictive analysis continues
to deliver higher median peak responses of inflation as well as wider distributions
11Several approaches have been developed in the literature to cope with the FG puzzle, such as
those in McKay, Nakamura and Steinsson (2016), Angeletos and Lian (2017), or Gabaix (2016).

of the inflation path than the posterior predictive analysis. This is evident in the
second and third row of Figure 4 where prior and posterior predictive analyses for
the inflation response for two and three years, respectively, of FG are shown. In
these cases, both the median peak responses (3.73 pp and 3.98 pp for two and
three years, respectively, of FG) and the ranges of the distribution at the peak
(12.93 pp and 13.19 pp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) for the prior
predictive analysis are higher than the median peak responses (3.16 pp and 3.20
pp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) and the ranges of the distribution
at the peak (8.47 pp and 10.03 pp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) for
the posterior predictive analysis but the difference in both cases is less pronounced
than in the case of one year of FG. That is, for longer durations of FG, the FG
puzzle is clearly evident also in the posterior predictive analysis. In any case, the
uncertainty surrounding the effects of the QE programme accompanied by FG on
inflation, in general, is substantial.
Comparing Figure 3(a) with Figures 4(a), 4(c) and 4(e), and Figure 3(b) with
Figures 4(b), 4(d) and 4(f), it is obvious that the parametrisation of the model
cannot explain the upward shift in the median path of inflation and the much
wider distribution of the inflation path ­ it is the same within the left and right
columns of Figures 3 and 4 ­ but can only be explained by the peg. That said, it is
nevertheless useful to examine the role of the parameters for two reasons: (i) Since
in the presented figures all parameters vary across draws, it is not clear what role
each single parameter plays for the distribution, and thus parameter uncertainty,
of the inflation response within each figure, that is, given a duration of FG and
given the type of predictive analysis (prior or posterior). (ii) Figures 4(a) and 4(b)
18
show that there is a pronounced difference in the median inflation response as well
as the width of the distribution across the type of predictive analysis. Since this
difference cannot be explained by the duration of FG ­ it is the same across the
two figures ­ it must be the case that the parametrisation drives this result but
it is not clear which parameters contribute most to this observation. Both issues
(i) and (ii) can be examined within the framework of predictive analysis. We deal
with issue (i) in Subsection 5.2 and with issue (ii) in Subsection 5.3.
5.2 The role of individual parameters for uncertainty
Following Leeper, Traum and Walker (2017), we derive a measure indicating which
parameters are most important for our results. In particular, we ask to which
extent each estimated parameter contributes to uncertainty for a given interest rate
peg, within each predictive analysis. To this end, we proceed as follows. For each
draw j  [1, J] of the parameters, j = j
1
. . . j
i
. . . j
n
, we simulate the model
and extract the peak response of inflation to the QE shock from these simulations.
In this way, we obtain a distribution of peak effects. Then, for each draw we
simulate the model again using a new parameter vector i,j = j
1
. . . ~
i
. . . j
n
,
where ~
i
denotes the ith parameter that is now fixed at the median for each draw
j. The only difference between j and i,j is thus the change from j
i
to ~
i
.
We again extract the peak response of inflation to the QE shock from these new
simulations and obtain a new distribution of peak effects. We do this for all
estimated structural parameters of the model i = 1, ..., n. We then calculate the
root mean squared error RMSEi

j=1
(peakj-peakj
i
)2
J
for each of the parameters,
where peakj
i
denotes the peak effect of inflation for draw j when the ith parameter

is fixed. The parameter with the highest RMSE has the biggest impact on the
variation of the peak response of inflation to a QE shock. We calculate the RMSEs
both for the prior and the posterior predictive analyses for zero, one, two, and three
years of FG.

Table 5 shows the RMSEs for the peak effect of inflation for the prior predictive
analyses when a given parameter is fixed at its prior median and different durations
20
of FG. The parameters are sorted in descending order according to their RMSEs.
Although there is variation in the ranking for different durations of FG, the broad
picture is that the Calvo parameters p
and w
which govern the probability of re-
setting prices and wages, respectively, play the most important role in determining
the uncertainty about the peak response of inflation to a QE shock. In contrast,
N
, the parameter governing net worth adjustment costs, has comparably little
influence on the uncertainty about the peak inflation response to a QE shock. The
latter observation is noteworthy since N
greater than zero is a prerequisite for
QE to have real effects in the model. A similar picture emerges for the peak effect
of inflation for the posterior predictive analyses when one parameter is fixed at
its posterior median, shown in Table 6. Across all durations of FG, the Calvo
parameters have a strong influence on the peak effect of inflation and hence on the
uncertainty about the effect, while, again, N
has comparably little impact.
The result that the financial friction parameter is of minor importance for the
outcomes of the policy scenarios is in line with other studies analysing the role of
financial frictions for the dynamics of macroeconomic variables. For example, Suh
and Walker (2016) find that the New Keynesian model with financial frictions is
not capable of reproducing the empirically observed dynamics between financial
and non-financial variables. That said, it is not obvious what the reason is for
this observation. For example, it could be due to the model structure per se or
to estimating the linear version of the model.12 However, our approach to analyse
parameter uncertainty is in no way dependent on the specific model structure or
the estimation of a linear version of the model.
12Although we estimate the linear version of the model, our simulations are based on the fully
non-linear version of the model with different durations of interest rate pegs.
21
5.3 Evaluating differences between prior and posterior pre-
dictive analysis
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show that there is a marked difference in the median infla-
tion response as well as the width of the distribution between the prior and the
posterior predictive analysis of the inflation response for one year of FG.13 Since
this difference cannot be explained by the duration of FG this suggests that the
strength of the FG puzzle depends on the parametrisation. Put differently, the
estimation carries the model into parameter regions where the FG puzzle is not as
apparent as in those parameter regions implied by prior distributions for one year
of FG. To evaluate the relative influence of each single parameter on this result,
we again apply the procedure described in subsection 5.2 but vary the experiment
in one important aspect: Instead of fixing a given parameter to the median of the
posterior distribution when conducting the posterior predictive analysis, we now
fix a given parameter to the median of the prior distribution when conducting the
posterior predictive analysis. We then again compare, draw by draw, the peak of
the inflation response thus obtained with the peak of the inflation response ob-
tained when all parameters are varied by computing the RMSEs for the different
parameters. In this way, we are able to determine the relative influence of the
parameters on the difference between the results of the prior and the posterior
predictive analysis for one year of FG, that is, on producing the FG puzzle.
Table 7 shows the RMSEs for the posterior predictive analysis in the case of one
year FG when a given parameter is fixed at its prior median, sorted in descending
13As described in section 5.1, this difference is also apparent for two and three years of FG,
albeit to a less pronounced degree.

order according to their RMSEs. We observe that w
has the highest RMSE
and thus the strongest influence on the different results across the prior and the
posterior predictive analysis for one year of FG, whereas  has the lowest influence.
N
, the parameter governing net worth adjustment costs, has, once again, only
little influence. We visualise this result with Figure 5 that shows the distribution
of the inflation response to a QE shock produced by a posterior predictive analysis
when w
(Figure 5(a)) and  (Figure 5(b)) are fixed at their prior median. The
change of  in the posterior predictive analysis to its prior median in each draw of
parameters essentially produces the same picture as in Figure 4(b), that is, the FG
puzzle is apparent only very moderately. To be precise, the median peak of the
inflation response changes minimally from 0.8083 pp in Figure 4(b) to 0.8079 pp in
Figure 5(b), and the range of the distribution at the peak changes only to a small
degree, from 0.4792 pp in Figure 4(b) to 0.4817 pp in Figure 5(b). In contrast, the
change of w
in the posterior predictive analysis to its prior median in each draw
of parameters produces a much higher median peak response of inflation of 1.5396
pp (an increase of around 90%) and a much wider range of the distribution at the

the result bears closer resemblance to the result of the prior predictive analysis for
one year of FG in Figure 4(a).
Note that the ranking of the RMSEs in Table 7 is different from the ranking of
RMSEs in Table 6(b) which shows the RMSEs for the posterior predictive analysis
when a given parameter is fixed at its posterior mean in the case of one year of
FG. This holds in general for all durations of FG. That is, it matters where a given
parameter is fixed in the framework of this type of predictive analysis, and the
decision of where to fix a given parameter depends on the question the researcher
seeks to answer.
24
6 Conclusion
We use prior and posterior predictive analysis to examine the extent of parameter
uncertainty when analysing the macroeconomic effects of the Eurosystem's PSPP
and FG. Prior and posterior predictive analysis provides a way of carrying over
the information about parameter uncertainty gained in the estimation of a model
to a policy scenario analysis involving the solution of a non-linear model (in our
case under the assumption of perfect foresight) with an anticipated interest rate
peg, and allows for identifying the driving parameters behind this uncertainty.
We find that the uncertainty about the effects of the PSPP is considerable and
increases when it is accompanied by FG. The Calvo parameters ­ which govern
the probability, in a given period, of being able to reset prices and wages ­ have
the biggest influence in determining the uncertainty about the inflation effects of
a QE shock while the financial friction in the form of net worth adjustment costs
is much less important.
In general, the method of using predictive analysis for illustrating parameter un-
certainty in policy scenarios is very flexible. In particular, its use does not depend
on a specific model structure, on estimating a linear or non-linear version of a
model, or on solving and simulating the model in a linear or non-linear setup.

Appendix A Model derivation
In our analysis we employ the model of Carlstrom et al. (2017).
A.1 Households and bond market structure
A.1.1 households' intertemporal consumption decision
Households maximise their intertemporal utility:
Et

s=0
sbt+s
ln (Ct+s
- hCt+s-1
) - B
H1+
t+s
(j)
1 + 
,
where Ct
is consumption, h is habit formation, Ht
(j) is the individual labour input
from household j, and bt
is a shock to the discount factor. Lifetime utility would
evaluate to:
V h
t
= bt
ln (Ct
- hCt-1
) - Dw
t
B
H1+
t
1 + 
+ Et
V h
t+1
The law of motion for capital is:
Kt
 (1 - ) Kt-1
+ It
Based on the households' nominal liability,
Ft-1
= CIt-1
+ CIt-2
+ 2CIt-3
+ ...,
one can show that CIt
= (Ft
- Ft-1
), where CIt
is the number of bonds newly
issued, and Ft
is the households' nominal liability on new issues. New investments
must be financed by issuing sufficient long term investment bonds which are pur-
chased by the FI. Perpetual bonds are used with cash flows of 1, , 2, etc.
The loan in advance constraint can be written as:
29
Pk
t
It

Qt
(Ft
- Ft-1
)
Pt
=
Qt
CIt
Pt
,
where Qt
is the time-t price of a new issue, Pt
is the price level and Pk
t
is the real
price of capital. Moreover, the usual budget constraint is given by:
Expenditure Side

A.1.2 Households' Lagrangian
The corresponding Lagrangian maximising household utility is:
L = Et

A.1.3 Financial intermediaries

to maximise the value func-
tion:

s=0

where  is a parameter for additional impatience using the basic household kernel
for discounting.
This maximisation is subject to the budget constraint which represents the law of

The net worth adjustment costs which limit the ability of the FI to adjust their

The according Lagrangian becomes:
L = Et

)] -
Pt+s-1

RL

This yields the following first-order conditions:

The FIs are subject to a simple hold-up problem which limits their ability to
attract deposits. When they choose to default they can seize a fraction µt
from
32
the household deposits. The incentive constraint for the FI not to default, because
their income is greater than the assets they can keep in default, is:
Et
Vt+1
Expected
future income
 µt
Lt
Nt
Fraction of their
balance sheet
Et
t+1
Pt
Pt+1
RL
t+1
Times next periods consumption
value plus earnings from lending
The model can be calibrated for it to be binding. By choosing the fraction of assets
the FI can keep in case of default to be
µt
= t
1 +
1
Nt
Et
gt+1
Xt+1
,
with t
an exogenous stochastic process that represents exogenous changes in the
financial friction. It follows an AR(1) process:
t
= (1 - 
) ss
+ 
t-1
+ ,t
.
Choosing this fraction ensures that leverage is a function independent of net worth.
Hence, the FIs take leverage as given and we can aggregate the firms as they are
just scaled equivalents. gt
is a function of current and forecasted market spreads
zt
independent of Nt-1
. Confirming the leverage equation, it follows:
Et

this can be simplified to

t
.
Regarding the balance sheet of the FI and its composition, leveraged net worth is
divided into holdings of long term government bonds and investment bonds:
Nt
Lt
= Bt
+ Ft
,
with Bt
 Qt
Bt
Pt
and Ft
 QI
t
Ft
Pt
.
The time-t asset value of current and past issues of investment is:
Qt
Ft
= Qt
CIt
+ Qt
CIt-1
+ CIt-2
+ 2CIt-3
,
where the time-t price of the perpetuity issued in t-1 is Qt
.
A.1.4 Term premium and price of capital mark-up
Rewriting the log-linearised version of the households' first-order condition with
respect to Kt
yields:
t
+ pk
t
+ mt
= Et
t+1
+ [1 -  (1 - )] rk
t+1
+  (1 - ) pk
t+1
+ mt+1
From the log-linearised version of the households first-order condition with respect
to Dt
, we know that Et
t+1
- t
= Et
t+1
- rt
, and hence
pk
t
+ mt
= Et
[1 -  (1 - )] rk
t+1
- (rt
- t+1
) +  (1 - ) pk
t+1
+ mt+1
.
34
Iterative substitution then yields the mark-up character of mt
on the price of
capital pk
t
:
pk
t
+ mt
= Et

j=0
[ (1 - )]j [1 -  (1 - )] rk
t+j+1
- (rt+j
- t+j+1
)
Similarly, one can show that iterative substitution can also be applied to the log-
linearised form of the households first-order condition with respect to Ft
, which
then can be written as:
mt
= Et

j=0
[]j {qt+j+1
- qt+j
- rt+j
}.
And since rL
t+1
= qt+1
RL
- qt
= 

qt+1
- qt
 qt+1
- qt
, this can be written as
the discounted sum of future loan to deposit spreads:
mt
 Et

j=0

A.2 Labour agencies
Perfectly competitive labour agencies combine differentiated labour inputs into a
homogenous labour composite Ht
according to the technology:
Ht
=


1
0
Ht
(j)w-1
w dj


w
w-1
where w
 1 is the elasticity of substitution between different varieties of labour.
The labour agencies purchase labour Ht
(j) at a nominal wage Wt
(j). Profit max-
imisation (i.e. cost minimisation) leads to the following problem:
35

A.2.1 Optimal wage
Households are monopolistic suppliers of differentiated labour inputs Ht
(j) and
set wages on a staggered basis (`
a la Calvo). In each period, the probability of
resetting the wage is (1 - w
), while with the complementary probability (w
) the
wage is automatically increased following the indexing rule:
Wt
(j) = w
t-1
Wt-1
(j)
The problem for a household j who can reset its wage at time t is:

A.3.2 Intermediate goods producers
A continuum of monopolistically competitive firms combines capital Kt-1
and
labour Ht
to produce intermediate goods according to a standard Cobb-Douglas
technology.
The production function is given by:
Yt
(i) = At
Kt-1
(i)Ht
(i)1-
44
The firms minimise their cost

subject to their production function, such that the corresponding Lagrangian reads:
L =

Pt
Ht
(i) + Rk
t
Kt-1
(i) + t
(i) Yt
(i) - At
Kt-1

Thus, the firms choose labour and capital as follows:

MPK(i)t

As intermediate result we get the marginal product of labour (MPL) and capital
(MPK), respectively. Solving the derivative w.r.t. Kt-1
for t
(i) and putting the
corresponding equation into the derivative w.r.t. Lt
yields:
Kt-1

Real marginal costs are derived as the shadow price of production t

we have:

A.3.3 Optimal price setting
The intermediate goods producers set prices based on Calvo contracts. In each pe-
riod firms adjust their prices with probability (1 - p
) independently form previous
adjustments. However, we depart from Calvo in the following way: For those firms
that cannot adjust their prices in a given period, prices will be reset according to
the following indexation rule:
Pt
(i) = p
t-1
Pt-1
(i),
where t
= Pt
Pt-1
is gross inflation.
The firms that adjust their prices face the following problem:

The resource constraint evaluates to:

In addition to the equilibrium conditions, the model comprises seven exogenous
processes.

.
2. Financial shock: t

3. Investment shock: µt
= (1 - µ

.
4. Wage markup shock: w,t
= (1 - w

 (w,t-1
) + w,t
.
5. Price markup shock: p,t
= (1 - p

 (p,t-1

.
6. Discount factor shock: bt

Appendix C Predictive analysis
In this section, we describe how we implement the prior/posterior predictive anal-
ysis. The same approach is also taken in Suh and Walker (2016) and Leeper et al.
(2015).
The prior predictive analysis we carry out entails the following steps:
1. Given the model, M outlined in Appendix A, and its corresponding struc-
tural parameters, , we posit a prior density, p(|M), specifying the range of
values for the parameters and the associated probabilities. The parameters
are drawn independently and ~
p (|M) denotes the product of the marginal
parameter distributions. We define an indicator function, I {  D
}, that is
assumed to take on the value one if  generates a determinate solution of the
model M and zero if it is not part of the subspace of parameters D
that de-
livers a unique rational expectations equilibrium. The joint prior distribution
is defined as p (|M) = c-1 ~
p (|M) I {  D
}, where c =

~
p (|M) d
describes a scaling factor that ensures that the prior density integrates to
one.
2. The model generates predictive distributions for its variables, yT
, using
p (yT
|M) =

p (yT
|, M) p (|M) d, where p (yT
|, M) = L (yT
|, M) de-
notes the likelihood of the data.
3. For any vector of interest, , the predictive distribution can be used to
produce p (|yT
, , M). Our statistics of interest are the response of inflation
after a QE shock in periods zero to 25 after the shock, as well as the peak
response of inflation.
Implementation in Dynare: First, we sample draws for the structural parameters
from the prespecified corresponding prior distributions. This is done using the
global sensitivity analysis (GSA) toolbox, which is part of Dynare. Then, we solve
the model under perfect foresight for each draw, simulate the path for inflation in
response to a QE shock and extract the peak of the inflation response. Having
these statistics at hand for every draw, we can calculate their median as well as
their dispersion.
We implement the posterior predictive analysis in the same way, except that we
sample draws for the structural parameters from the posterior distributions ob-
tained by the Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

Appendix D Estimation
D.1 MCMC diagnostics
Figure 6 shows the univariate convergence statistics for all estimated parameters h,
w
, p
, , , w
, p
, N
, 
and y
. The statistics include three different measures:
the measure presented in the column 'intervall' is based on an interval statistic
constructed around the parameter mean (i.e. the 80% HPD intervall). The mea-
sures shown in the columns variance and skewness are based on a statistic that
depicts squared and cubed deviations from the parameter mean. The blue line
depicts theses measures based on all draws (i.e. draws from all Markov chains
together - between chain measure) and the red line is based on the draws from the
individual chains (within a chain measure). Each row in Figure 6 corresponds to
one parameter.

D.2 Trace plots
To show that the draws for the estimated structural parameters which we use
for the posterior predictive analysis are not trending or display otherwise strange
behavior, we also present trace plots for all structural parameters in Figure 7. Since
we rely on the last 100,000 draws from the first Markov chain, we correspondingly
present the trace plots for each of the parameters base on the first Markov chain
which contains 500,000 draws in total.
