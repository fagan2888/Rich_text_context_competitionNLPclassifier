Abstract
Previous research on harmony perception has mainly been concerned with horizontal aspects of
harmony, turning less attention to how listeners perceive psychoacoustic qualities and emotions in
single isolated chords. A recent study found mild dissonances to be more preferred than
consonances in single chord perception, although the authors did not systematically vary
register and consonance in their study; these omissions were explored here. An online
empirical experiment was conducted where participants (N ¼ 410) evaluated chords on the
dimensions of Valence, Tension, Energy, Consonance, and Preference; 15 different chords were
played with piano timbre across two octaves. The results suggest significant differences on all
dimensions across chord types, and a strong correlation between perceived dissonance and
tension. The register and inversions contributed to the evaluations significantly, nonmusicians
distinguishing between triadic inversions similarly to musicians. The mildly dissonant minor
ninth, major ninth, and minor seventh chords were rated highest for preference, regardless of
musical sophistication. The role of theoretical explanations such as aggregate dyadic consonance,
the inverted-U hypothesis, and psychoacoustic roughness, harmonicity, and sharpness will be
discussed to account for the preference of mild dissonance over consonance in single chord
perception.

Introduction
Research on harmony perception has predominantly been concerned with harmony's
horizontal dimension in the form of harmonic progressions (e.g., Bigand & Parncutt, 1999;
Bigand, Parncutt & Lerdahl, 1996; Sloboda, 1991; Webster & Weir, 2005). Considerably less
attention has been turned to harmony's vertical dimension, that is, how listeners perceive

single chords (three or more simultaneous pitches) isolated from all musical context.
As Huron (1994) notes: ``little is known about the perception of three or more concurrent
pitches . . .'' (p. 304) and Gabrielsson and Lindstro
¨ m (2010) concur: ``. . . there is practically
nothing on how different kinds of chords . . . may affect expression'' (p. 393).
While there have been some empirical studies conducted on specifically vertical harmony
perception, the emphasis has been mainly on harmonic intervals (e.g., Costa, Bitti, &
Bonfiglioli, 2000; Krantz, Merker, & Madison, 2004; Maher, 1980; Oelmann & Laeng,
2009), on the major or minor triad distinction (e.g., Bakker & Martin, 2015; Crowder,
1985; Heinlein, 1928; Kastner & Crowder, 1990), or on the perception of consonance or
dissonance mostly in triads (e.g., Bidelman & Krishnan, 2011; Cook, 1999; Pallesen et al.,
2005; Roberts, 1986). Research addressing the perception of chords containing more than
three pitches has been rare: Studies focusing directly on single chord perception while using a
more diverse chord palette have been conducted by Minati et al. (2009) who applied tetrads in
a neurological experiment on consonance or dissonance perception; Kuusi (2010, 2011) who
investigated how listeners perceive nontraditional (nontonal) chords; and by Lahdelma and
Eerola (2016) who focused exclusively on the emotion perception of single chords, spanning
both triads and seventh chords.
As Parncutt (1989) puts it, ``musical sounds are consonant if they are perceived to `sound
well' with each other (con sonare), and suggests that ``chords are consonant if they contain no
dissonant intervals'' (p. 56). Consonance or dissonance can be divided into two subcategories:
Single isolated intervals and chords represent sensory consonance or dissonance
(psychoacoustics), while consonance or dissonance in chords and intervals while being part
of a musical context is referred to as musical consonance or dissonance or musical acoustics
(e.g., Krumhansl, 1990; Terhardt, 1984; Zwicker & Fastl, 1990).
It is widely held that sensory dissonance arises from the beating of frequency
components (e.g., Hutchinson & Knopoff, 1978; Kameoka & Kuriyagawa, 1969).
According to McDermott, Lehr, and Oxenham (2010) ``beating occurs whenever two
sinusoids of differing frequency are combined'' (p. 1), which in turn creates the sound
quality of roughness that listeners typically perceive as unpleasant. The effect of roughness
is seen as prevalent in dissonant, but not in consonant musical chords (e.g., Hutchinson &
Knopoff, 1978; Plomp & Levelt, 1965). Zentner and Kagan (1998) propose that the
preferential bias for consonance could be innate, basing this view on their finding that
infants are biologically prepared to treat consonance as more pleasant than dissonance;
this view of an innate preference for consonance, however, has later been challenged by
Plantinga and Trehub (2014).
Zwicker and Fastl (1990, p. 313) point out three actual factors that contribute to sensory
consonance or dissonance: (a) roughness, (b) sharpness, and (c) tonalness (in contrast to
noisiness). More recent studies (Cousineau, McDermott, & Peretz, 2012; McDermott
et al., 2010), however, suggest that harmonicity, that is, ``the extent that the sonority's
audible spectrum corresponds to a harmonic series'' (Parncutt, 2014a, p. 972) plays also an
important role in the perception of consonance or dissonance, possibly an even more
important one than roughness. According to this view, ``consonant chords derive their
pleasantness not from the absence of beating, but rather from their similarity to single
notes with harmonic spectra'' (McDermott et al., 2010, p. 2). The study by McDermott
et al. (2010) curiously indicates that harmonicity preferences correlate with musical
expertise, suggesting that exposure to music amplifies preferences for harmonic frequencies
because of their musical importance.
According to the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), chords that are considered as
mildly dissonant in terms of both sensory (i.e., chords containing dissonant intervals) as well

as musical consonance or dissonance (see e.g., Re
´ ve
´ sz, 1954) were actually the most preferred
ones among a heterogeneous and big sample of listeners including both experts and inexperts:
The mildly dissonant minor seventh and major seventh chords were more preferred than the
consonant major and minor triads. This proposes an ostensible paradox: Consonance and
preference or pleasantness are often seen as indisputably overlapping or even being
completely synonymous in terms of harmony perception (see e.g., Bidelman & Krishnan,
2011; Cousineau et al., 2012; Tramo, Cariani, Delgutte, & Braida, 2001; Tymoczko, 2011).
Parncutt (1989), however, aptly reminds that ``relatively consonant sounds are not necessarily
preferred to relatively dissonant sounds. If this were the case, single tones would always be
preferred to chords'' (p. 57). He proposes that the relationship between dissonance
(complexity) and preference usually takes the form of an inverted-U curve: ``for relatively
low degrees of dissonance, preference increases with increasing dissonance, while for
relatively high degrees, preference decreases with increasing dissonance'' (p. 57).
While the inverted-U hypothesis (e.g., Berlyne, 1971) offers one possible explanation for
why mild dissonance is preferred over consonance in single chord perception, it does not seem
to be all-encompassing. For example, it cannot account for the fact that according to the data
of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), the dominant seventh chord (major­minor seventh) was less
preferred than the major and minor triads, which according to the inverted-U hypothesis as
such should be the other way around; the dominant seventh being somewhere in between the
extremes of consonance and dissonance when considering a large number of possible chord
sonorities (cf. Huron, 1994). Moreover, on an empirical note, Orr and Ohlsson (2005) did not
find evidence for an inverted-U relation for experts in their experiment when testing the
relationship between liking and complexity in musical improvisations.
Inspecting the phenomenon from a different angle, it is striking how in Huron's (1994)
aggregate dyadic consonance calculations (the sum of the consonances of all interval classes
within a chord) the most consonant pitch set for tetrads (out of all possible four-pitch
combinations) is the minor seventh chord, the major seventh chord being the third most
consonant. Intriguingly, with regard to tetrachords, the highest amount of aggregate dyadic
consonance is parallel with the evaluations for highest subjective preference in the data of
Lahdelma and Eerola (2016). Huron (1994), however, reminds that ``in the case of these
three- and four-note sets, it is important to recognize that the consonance measures do not
reflect the consonance of the complete set of concurrently sounding tones (such as the
consonance of `a major triad')'' (p. 301). Despite this important caveat, the analogy
between high aggregate dyadic consonance and preference in single chords is striking.
As pitch class sets comprising five and six pitches yield the most aggregate dyadic
consonance in single chords (Huron, 1994), the aim of the current experiment is to
broaden the chord palette of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016) to encompass not only triads
and tetrachords but also penta- and hexachords containing most aggregate dyadic
consonance to empirically test how these are perceived compared with one another and
whether there indeed is the possibility that high aggregate dyadic consonance values
predict preference in single chord perception.
In addition, the current experiment's aim is to test whether the found differences in the
perception of triadic inversions in the data of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016) hold up with
randomized chord roots. In their data, with the major triad, the tendency was that the applied
dimensions of valence, tension, and energy all exhibited a pattern of increasing ratings from root
through first inversion to second inversion, on both applied timbres (piano and strings). A similar
pattern also occurred for the dimensions of interest or expectancy, happiness or joy, and liking or
preference. However, in their experiment, the chords were played only in a single octave (C4) and
exclusively with C roots. Hence, the results could be due to register differences between the
Lahdelma and Eerola 3
inversions (e.g., the major triad's second inversion being higher in register than the root position
and the first inversion), as pitch height reportedly affects actual music perception (e.g., Ilie &
Thompson, 2006; Jaquet, Danuser, & Gomez, 2014). Thus, we feel that with regard to the triadic
inversions, the randomization of chord roots across two octaves can tell us more about the role of
register in accounting for the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016).
Experiment
In the current experiment, we asked participants to rate single chords (see Figure 1) isolated
from all musical context (major and minor triads with inversions, selected tetra-, penta-, and
hexachords in root positions) using five scales measuring separate emotional and perceptual
qualities.
The first three bipolar dimensions of the five scales were adopted from Schimmack and
Grob (2000). Their three-dimensional model of affect attempts to capture the core affects
using the three bipolar dimensions of valence (intrinsic attractiveness or aversiveness), energy
arousal, and tension arousal. These dimensions have been applied in studies using actual
music as stimuli (e.g., Ilie & Thompson, 2006), effectively separating the effects of register
on perception, as well as in an experiment conducted directly on single chord perception
(Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016). The fourth applied dimension was consonance (used in studies by
e.g., Bidelman & Krishnan, 2011; Roberts, 1986) in order to capture the participants'
subjective perception of consonance and dissonance in a given chord. The fifth dimension
measured the participants' subjective preference for each chord. These last two dimensions
were chosen in order to investigate the amount of intersection between perceived consonance
and preference with regard to single chord perception.
Method
Participants. The participants for the study were recruited through the Internet with the aim of
drawing the attention of both musicians and nonmusicians in order to have a substantial,
heterogeneous, and international participant pool (see e.g., Honing & Ladinig, 2008 and
Honing & Reips, 2008 for a review of the benefits of this strategy). The experiment was

different universities, music institutions, and music research communities around the world.
As an incentive, three E30 gift cards to Amazon were drawn between all participants who left
their e-mail addresses for this purpose after taking the experiment. The total amount of
participants was 434, out of which 418 were considered valid for further statistical
analysis; 12 participants were removed due to technical problems evident on the basis of
the interface's result database (and in most cases corroborated by reports that certain chords
did not play because of internet connection problems), and 4 participants were annulled as
their answers were obviously malicious in nature (i.e., no chord evaluations done or evidently
random clicking in a minimum amount of time spent on the experiment website). Out of the
remaining 418 participants, 8 extreme outliers were removed (described in more detail in the
Results), making the final number of valid cases 410.
In total, 42 different nationalities were represented in the final participant pool
(continental breakdown: 61.2% Europe, 30.5% Americas, and 8.3% others). The biggest
nationality groups represented were Finland (33.9%), the USA (21.2%), and Great Britain
(9.8%). The participants were aged 15 to 87 years (mean ¼ 30.7, SD ¼ 13.4, 50% males). The
participants' musical sophistication was measured with the Ollen Musical Sophistication
Index (Ollen, 2006), a 10-item questionnaire yielding a score for each participants' musical
sophistication between 0 and 999 (mean ¼ 545, SD ¼ 336.9), the score of 500 being the
threshold between a respondent being more musically sophisticated and less musically
sophisticated (see Marcs Auditory Laboratories, http://marcs-survey.uws.edu.au/OMSI/
omsi.php).
Stimuli. The chord material (Figure 1) consisted of major and minor triads (played in their
root positions and in their first and second inversions, respectively), tetrachords (major sixth
and minor seventh), pentachords (dominant ninth, minor ninth, major ninth, pentatonic, and
Neapolitan pentachord [as referred to in Solomon, 2005]), and hexachords (dominant
seventh sharp eleventh and diatonic hexachord). Only the triad chords were played with
inversions in order to further investigate the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), all
other chords were played exclusively in their root positions. All chords were played in
close position. The tetrachords, pentachords, and hexachords were selected on the basis of
Huron's (1994) table for chords containing most aggregate dyadic consonance.
As familiarity is an important component in chord perception (see e.g., Parncutt & Hair,
2011), we decided to include highly consonant chords (selected from a list by Tymoczko,
2011, p. 63) that are more familiar from actual musical context when compared with some of
the rarer chord sonorities containing high aggregate dyadic consonance in order to see how
this possibly affects the chord evaluations. The major sixth and the minor seventh represent
the same pitch-class set as they contain the same pitches in different orderings; we decided to
include both chords in order to investigate if there is any difference in how they are perceived
depending on the chord's root.
All selected chords were transposed with a randomization across two octaves ( Æ 5
semitones around C4 and C5, the possible chord roots being all equally likely to occur
within this range). Thus, the stimuli consisted of 15 chords (Figure 1) performed with
piano timbre across two octaves, making the total sum of chords for each participant 30.
All chords were exactly 4.8 seconds in length and played in equal temperament. The chords
were generated with Ableton Live 9 (a commercial music sequencer software), using the
Synthogy Ivory Grand Pianos II plug-in. The applied sound font was Steinway D Concert
Grand with a touch of ambience reverb added to the chord samples to make them sound more
natural. The attack, articulation, and reverb values of the chords were kept as neutral as

Procedure. The web-based chord evaluation application was programmed with JavaScript.
The application was made specifically for the purpose of the current experiment and was
accessible online between May 15, 2015 and June 12, 2015. It was programmed to gather the
participants' demographic background information (gender, nationality, age), musical
preference (Short Test Of Music Preferences; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), musical
sophistication (Ollen Musical Sophistication Index; Ollen, 2006), and the type of audio
device used to take the experiment.
The participants received the following instructions:
In the experiment you will be asked to rate 30 chords on 5 dimensions, and to provide some
background information concerning your musical education. You can listen to each chord as
many times as you like before evaluating it. Each chord should be evaluated as a separate entity,
regardless of preceding or sequential chords.
The participants were asked to rate each chord on the presented 5-item scale (Appendix).
The five dimensions were rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. With valence, the
bipolar extremes were 1 ¼ negative and 7 ¼ positive. With tension, the extremes were
1 ¼ relaxed and 7 ¼ tense, and with energy, the extremes were 1 ¼ low and 7 ¼ high. With
consonance, the extremes were 1 ¼ rough and 7 ¼ smooth, these two poles having been used
extensively in research literature (e.g., Bregman, 1994; Parncutt & Hair, 2011; van de Geer,
Levelt, & Plomp, 1962). For preference, the applied poles were 1 ¼ low and 7 ¼ high.
The participants were given the chance to listen each chord as many times as they wished.
The ordering of the chords, the chords' roots (across two octaves), as well as the ordering of
the five dimensions were randomized for each participant.
Results
All extreme outliers (over Æ 3.0 SD's in dimension aggregations, 8 sets of answers altogether)
were removed from the participant pool (N ¼ 418), making the final number of valid cases
410. The rating scales' internal consistency was measured with Cronbach's alpha (range
.80 À .87, see Table 1 for details). Correlations between the five variables were calculated
(Table 1). The strongest correlations were found between the dimensions of tension and
consonance (À.97), tension and preference (À.79), and between tension and energy (.78).

While there is certainly overlap between the dimensions of valence, consonance, and
preference, this overlap is not complete (cf. the virtually complete negative correlation
between tension and consonance) and shows that perceived consonance does not
automatically result in more perceived valence and preference in single chord perception.
The Effect of Musical Factors on the Chord Evaluations
To estimate whether the ratings across the chords and register exhibited any differences, a
two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was carried out for all five dimensions with
the Chord Type and Register (Low and High) as the two within-subject factors. Chord Type
consisted of the 11 main categories of chords in which the triadic inversions were collapsed
into the main types of triad chords.
Chord Type and Register. As displayed in Table 2, all scales display significant main effects of
Chord Type and Register. Out of these two factors, Chord Type is typically larger, with effect
sizes ranging from 0.07 to 0.37, whereas Register exhibits considerably lower effect sizes
(0.001­0.04). In all cases, except for energy, there was also a weak interaction between the
factors. The summary of the analysis of variance (Table 2) reveals that for valence, tension,
and consonance, the differences in ratings across Chord Type were strikingly large (i.e., effect
sizes above .25, which display generalized eta squared values, 2
G
, at the Chord Type column's
right side). The effect sizes across Register (the Register column's right side) were
considerably smaller, the two largest being on the dimensions of tension (.04) and energy
(.03). The effect size for valence was conspicuously small, and these findings are in line with
Parncutt (2014b) who proposes that pitch height in music is normally associated with arousal,
not valence. Parncutt also suggests that music with a high average pitch tends to contain
more energy than music with a low average pitch; this seems to hold true also for single chord
perception. Ilie and Thompson (2006) also found tension to grow with pitch height in an
empirical setting using actual musical excerpts as stimuli; again, this same effect is present in
single chord perception as well (Figure 2).
The main effects of Chord Type across the dimensions provide further interesting results.
When we look at the effects of Chord Type (aggregated over register), the perceived valence
was highest for the major triad with a mean of 5.56 (SD ¼ 1.27) and lowest for the Neapolitan
pentachord with a mean of 2.62 (SD ¼ 1.26). Perceived tension was highest for the Neapolitan

pentachord with a mean of 5.89 (SD ¼ 1.11), followed by the dominant seventh sharp
eleventh chord with a mean of 5.51 (SD ¼ 1.15). The lowest mean rating on the dimension
of tension was for the major triad's mean of 2.65 (SD ¼ 1.46). Perceived energy was highest
for the dominant seventh sharp eleventh chord with a mean of 4.81 (SD ¼ 1.28), followed by
the Neapolitan pentachord's mean of 4.56 (SD ¼ 1.47), and the dominant ninth's mean of
4.54 (SD ¼ 1.25). The lowest mean rating on the dimension of energy was for the minor triad
with a mean of 3.52 (SD ¼ 1.34). The perceived consonance mean rating was highest for the
major triad with a mean of 5.71 (SD ¼ 1.31), the lowest for the Neapolitan pentachord's
mean of 2.16 (SD ¼ 1.13). On a side note, it is worth noting how the added sixth chord
(M ¼ 4.49, SD ¼ 1.31) was perceived as less consonant than the minor seventh chord
(M ¼ 4.68, SD ¼ 1.30), even though the chords represent the same pitch class set. The
highest rating on the dimension preference was for the major ninth chord with a mean of
4.74 (SD ¼ 1.39), followed closely by the minor ninth's mean of 4.72 (SD ¼ 1.39), and the
minor seventh's mean of 4.68 (SD ¼ 1.30). The lowest mean rating on the dimension of
preference was for the Neapolitan pentachord with a mean of 3.40 (SD ¼ 1.65), followed
by the dominant seventh sharp eleventh chord's mean of 3.95 (SD ¼ 1.65).
We also explored the influence of additional variables such as diatonicity (the proportion
of tones belonging to diatonic scales within each chord) and chord ambitus (difference

between highest and lowest tone in semitones) to ANOVA analyses as within-subject
covariates, but both of these variables failed to make an impact on the results.
Triadic inversions. As can be seen from Table 3, the perception of triadic inversions is mostly in
line with the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016): Energy and tension exhibit significant
main effects with the ratings growing from root through first inversion to second inversion in
both major and minor triads, and the scale of preference does not exhibit a significant main
effect with regard to inversions. The current study's added scale of consonance or dissonance
exhibits a significant main effect with an opposing pattern when compared with the scales of
tension and energy: In both major and minor triads, perceived consonance decreases from
root through first inversion to second inversion (Figure 3). With regard to the major triad, the
least amount of perceived consonance in the chords' second inversion is notably in line with
musical convention (see e.g., Randel, 2003); intriguingly, however, this pattern of perception
was not influenced by musical sophistication. Strikingly, both musicians and nonmusicians
distinguished between the triadic inversions on the dimensions of energy, tension, and
consonance or dissonance similarly. To our knowledge, the current experiment is the first
one to empirically demonstrate this trend.
The only notable difference between the current data and the results of Lahdelma and
Eerola (2016) is on the scale of valence. While exhibiting a statistically significant main effect,
this significance is considerably smaller in the current data and showcases a different pattern.
The randomization of roots seems to have dissolved virtually any perceived difference
between the major triad's inversions, and the minor triad's first inversion was perceived as
containing the most amount of positive valence (Figure 3); in the data of Lahdelma and
Eerola (2016), the difference between the minor triad's first and second inversions with regard
to valence was negligible. However, the current finding could be explained with the fact that
the minor triad's first inversion has a major third above the bass and might hence sound
somewhat ``major.'' Curiously, Hutchinson and Knopoff (1979) suggest that the minor triad's
first inversion is actually the most consonant of the chords' inversions; paradoxically this was
not corroborated by the current empirical data (despite the most perceived valence in this
particular inversion), as the minor triad's root position was perceived as containing more
consonance than its first inversion.
In sum, the randomized chord roots of the triads might provide a slightly more
accurate picture of the perceived differences between the triadic inversions, but the
overall tendency of the current results is quite similar to the findings of Lahdelma and

The Effect of Background Factors on the Chord Evaluations
Past studies indicate that gender (e.g., Costa et al., 2000; Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016) and
musical expertise (e.g., Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016; McLachlan, Marco, Light, & Wilson,
2013) may affect vertical harmony perception. Moreover, it has been suggested that
familiarity affects the perception of chords (e.g., McLachlan et al., 2013; Parncutt & Hair,
2011) and the perception of consonance or dissonance in general (e.g., Cazden, 1972;
Heyduk, 1975).
In the current study, musical expertise was assessed with the Ollen Musical Sophistication
Index (Ollen, 2006); music preferences were inferred from the ratings of 13 genres that were
recoded into four meta-genres suggested by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) according to
hierarchical cluster analysis clustering the participants according to the similarity of their
music preferences into four clusters. Each participant belonged to one of these clusters,
labeled as Reflective or Complex (n ¼ 215), Intense or Rebellious (n ¼ 86), Upbeat or
Conventional (n ¼ 76), or Energetic or Rhythmic (n ¼ 33). Separate mixed ANOVAs were
carried out with emotion ratings across the three between-subjects factors (Gender,
Musical Expertise, and Music Preferences) reported in Table 4.
Most of the ratings scales did not yield significant main effects; we will now briefly outline
the ones that actually portrayed differences. For valence ratings, Gender, Musical Expertise,
and Music Preferences yielded significant differences; males rated the chords as more
positively valenced (M ¼ 4.30, SD ¼ 1.53) than females (M ¼ 4.15, SD ¼ 1.60), musicians
more positively (M ¼ 4.36, SD ¼ 1.57) than nonmusicians (M ¼ 4.07, SD ¼ 1.54), and those
labeled as preferring music that is ``reflective and complex'' also had higher ratings of valence
(M ¼ 4.33, SD ¼ 1.57) than the other three music preference groups (M ¼ 4.11, SD ¼ 1.52).
For ratings of energy, only Music Preferences showed significant differences (those classified
as listening to Upbeat or Conventional music, M ¼ 4.09, SD ¼ 1.39, whereas listeners of
Intense or Rebellious music rated the chords lower on energy, M ¼ 3.89, SD ¼ 1.33). With
respect to tension, none of the background variables contributed to the chord ratings.
Consonance, on the other hand, exhibited differences according to Gender and Musical
Expertise, where males (M ¼ 4.42, SD ¼ 1.66) displayed higher ratings than females
(M ¼ 4.32, SD ¼ 1.71) and those listening to Reflective or Complex music displayed higher
ratings (M ¼ 4.44, SD ¼ 1.73) than other listeners (M ¼ 4.24, SD ¼ 1.62). Finally, preference

indicated significant differences across the background variables, being very similar to the
pattern exhibited by valence (males, musicians, and those preferring reflective and complex
music showing higher ratings of preference for all chords). It is important to note here that few
of the scales displayed interactions between background variables and chords. The exceptions
were energy, where Musical Expertise displayed an interaction with chord types, F(10,
3940) ¼ 3.74, p < .001, and tension, where Musical Expertise, F(10, 3940) ¼ 6.37, p < .001,
and Gender, F ¼ 1.83, p < .001, interacted with chord types. Also consonance interacted with
Musical Expertise and chords (F ¼ 3.51, p < .001), as well as preference, where Music
Preferences created an interaction with the chord types (F ¼ 2.28, p < .001).
To summarize, these results suggest that those with higher musical expertise perceived the
chords as more positive in valence, more consonant, and also preferred the chords more. This
finding is in line with the notion that familiarity in fact affects the perception of chords
(McLachlan et al., 2013), as well as the perception of consonance or dissonance in general
(Cazden, 1972; Heyduk, 1975). In the context of all ratings, the magnitude of variations
according to background, however, is considerably small and negligible (effect sizes < .01).
Acoustic Properties of the Chords
To examine the relationship between psychoacoustic properties and perceptual evaluations of
the chords, few selected features were extracted using MIR toolbox (version 1.6.1; Lartillot,
Toiviainen, & Eerola, 2008) and custom MATLAB functions based on prior studies. These
were (a) harmonicity (Jensen, 1999) that accounts for the regularity of the amplitude of
adjoining partials, (b) roughness that captures the sensory beating of the partials in the
sound using a psychoacoustic model by Vassilakis (2001), and (c) sharpness that is related
to the high-frequency content of the sound (Zwicker & Fastl, 1991). Figure 4 displays the
mean values across the chord types for all three features. Moreover, to formally connect
the ratings to these descriptors, a linear regression was used to assess the degree of fit between
the descriptors and the ratings (see Table 5).
As can be seen in Table 5, roughness and sharpness correlate statistically significantly with
the dimensions of tension, energy, and consonance. Both roughness and sharpness correlate
positively with tension and especially with energy, while negatively with consonance. We
suggest that the lesser amount of perceived consonance in chords played in the higher
register (Figure 2) could be explained with the effect of sharpness, as chords in the lower
register actually have significantly more objective roughness compared with chords in the
higher register (Figure 4), despite being subjectively perceived as more consonant. This
finding is in line with the notion that sharpness is another form of sensory dissonance (in
addition to roughness), caused by energy at high frequencies (see Aures, 1985a, 1985b).
With regard to the difference between objective roughness and subjective dissonance, the
current data offer some intriguing insights. As can be seen from Figure 4, the diatonic
hexachord is theoretically more rough than the dominant sharp eleventh chord, and the
pentatonic chord more rough than the Neapolitan pentachord. The ordering of these
chords' subjective dissonance, however, was exactly the opposite: the pentatonic chord was
perceived as significantly more consonant compared with the Neapolitan pentachord and the
diatonic hexachord slightly more consonant compared with the dominant sharp eleventh
chord (Figure 2). This difference could be explained with Johnson-Laird, Kang, and Leong
(2012) concept of tonal dissonance. They suggest that dissonance

dissonance is a consequence of high-level cognitive processes that rely on a tacit knowledge of the
principles of tonality. (p. 24)
They propose that tonal dissonance depends on the scales in which the chords can occur: ``chords
occurring in a major scale should be less dissonant than chords occurring only in a minor scale,
which in turn should be less dissonant than chords occurring in neither sort of scale'' (p. 24).
The Neapolitan pentachord is not present in either of the scales, and it was in fact perceived as the
least consonant and was the least preferred of all the presented chords in the current experiment.
The second least consonant and preferred dominant sharp eleventh chord is not present in a
major scale (cf. the diatonic hexachord) either, but could theoretically be constructed from the
melodic minor scale's pitches in an extended tonality. The rest of the chords applied in the current
experiment contain no tonal dissonance. Hence, the results clearly corroborate Johnson-Laird
et al.'s (2012) theory of tonal dissonance with regard to single chord perception.
It is somewhat surprising that harmonicity did not exhibit statistically significant correlations
with any of the five dimensions. As higher harmonicity is often seen as resulting in a higher
amount of perceived consonance (e.g., Cousineau et al., 2012; McDermott et al., 2010), and
consonance in turn being often described as a synonym for pleasantness (e.g., Bidelman &
Krishnan, 2011; Bones, Hopkins, Krishnan, & Plack, 2014), the data of the current study
imply that harmonicity does not automatically result in consonance and preference in the case
of single isolated chords consisting of three or more pitches. Concrete examples of this
phenomenon in the current data are the chords of the dominant ninth and the dominant
sharp eleventh: Both chords have strikingly high harmonicity values (Figure 4) but were
nonetheless rated quite low on the dimensions of consonance and preference (Figure 2). The
pentatonic chord in turn has a low amount of harmonicity but was rated relatively high for
preference. The chord with the lowest amount of harmonicity, the minor seventh, was in fact
perceived as the third most consonant and also the third most preferred among the presented
chords. The obtained results might also be influenced by the piano timbre that was used in the
current experiment. We will return to these questions in the Discussion part.
As harmonicity, roughness, and sharpness by themselves did not correlate statistically
significantly with the dimension of preference, we will next outline the possibility of how
aggregate dyadic consonance (Huron, 1994) might affect perceived preference in single chords.
Aggregate Dyadic Consonance
Aggregate dyadic consonance and roughness seem to be related to preference in a curvilinear
fashion. There is no linear correlation between the means of the chords in terms of preference
and aggregate dyadic consonance (r ¼ À.16, p ¼ .68) or roughness (r ¼ À.24, p ¼ .54), but a

second-order polynominal fits the relation better (see Figure 5), especially for roughness
(R2adj ¼ .58, p < .05). In other words, combining the aspects of roughness and aggregate
dyadic consonance could explain why mildly dissonant chords are most preferred. The
chords of the dominant sharp eleventh and the Neapolitan pentachord are omitted from
this model, as they contain tonal dissonance (Johnson-Laird et al., 2012).
Ascanbeseenfrom Figure5,chords that containa medium amount of roughness(minorninth,
minor ninth, minor seventh, added sixth, and dominant ninth) are not equally highly preferred as
would be predicted by the inverted-U hypothesis. The minor ninth, the major ninth, and the minor
seventhchordsaremorepreferredthantheothersemi-roughchords,possiblybecausetheycontain
high aggregate dyadic consonance. While the added sixth chord contains the same amount of
aggregate dyadic consonance as the minor seventh chord, it however contains slightly more
roughness; the major second interval present in the chord clearly has a negative impact on its
preference, possibly due to enculturation (cf. Krantz et al., 2004). As for the pentatonic and
hexatonic chords, these chords also contain high amounts of aggregate dyadic consonance, but
the overall roughness of these chords seems to ``overrule'' their preference, especially in the
hexatonic chord's case. The preference ratings dramatically drop between the pentatonic and
the hexatonic chords: It could be argued that there is a critical threshold of roughness in single
chord perception which cannot be exceeded in order for the chord to gain high preference ratings.

might explainwhythechordisrelativelypreferrednonetheless. Inotherwords,amoderately high
amount of roughness does not automatically result in declined preference in single chord
perception. In the hexatonic chord's case, the overall roughness of the chord seems to cross
that critical threshold for roughness: this particular chord is the roughest of all the presented
chords, and hence not preferred despite its theoretically high aggregate dyadic consonance. Thus,
interestingly a combination of the U-theory with aggregate dyadic consonance seems to most
effectively predict preference in single chord perception: the most preferred chords contain a
moderate amount of aggregate dyadic consonance. It is important to keep in mind, however,
that the current model has only nine data points; further research is needed to shed light on the
role of aggregate dyadic consonance on the preference of single chords.
Discussion
This study aimed to investigate how listeners perceive single chords across a 5-item scale of
dimensions consisting of valence, tension, energy, consonance, and preference. The results
suggest that mildly dissonant chords in terms of both musical (see e.g., Re
´ ve
´ sz, 1954) and
sensory consonance or dissonance were actually more preferred than maximally consonant
chords among a large and heterogeneous pool of participants, across both expert and
inexpert listeners.
We outlined theoretical explanations to account for the preference of mild dissonance in
single chord perception. These include aggregate dyadic consonance (Huron, 1994), the
inverted-U hypothesis (e.g., Berlyne, 1971), as well as the role of psychoacoustic
phenomena in the form of harmonicity, roughness, and sharpness. We feel that the
inverted-U hypothesis is not necessarily all encompassing to account for the preference of
mild dissonances: Both the dominant seventh chord in the data of Lahdelma and Eerola
(2016) as well as the dominant ninth in the current study were rated low for preference even
though these chords are representing middle ground in terms of complexity when considering
a wide range of sonorities.
The overall results suggest that the background factors of gender, musical sophistication,
and musical preferences affected single chord evaluations to some extent--musicians
interestingly objecting less to dissonance than nonmusicians. The overall magnitude of
variations according to background was, however, quite small. Nonetheless, the findings are
in line with propositions that familiarity affects chord perception (McLachlan et al., 2013) as
well as the evaluation of consonance or dissonance (Cazden, 1972; Heyduk, 1975). On the other
hand, it is intriguing how familiarity does not seem to predict preference in the dominant ninth
chord's case: It is the only pentad present in major­minor tonality and should thus be more
familiar than the other, possibly more exotic five-pitch sonorities used in the current experiment.
Despite its familiarity, the dominant ninth was the least preferred pentad after the Neapolitan
pentachord. This is somewhat surprising taking the high amount of harmonicity and only the
moderate amount of roughness present in the chord. We surmise that the low preference for the
dominant seventh chord (Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016) and the current study's dominant ninth
chord might stem from the culturally loaded tritone interval present in these chords. The
avoidance of tritone as an interval has both psychoacoustic and cultural origins (Parncutt,
1989, 2014a), and this avoidance seems to influence also the perception of chords in which it
is present. The chord also contains low aggregate dyadic consonance. The low-perceived
consonance and preference of the Neapolitan pentachord also suggests the role of
enculturation in the form of tonal dissonance (Johnson-Laird et al., 2012) instead of a purely
psychoacoustic explanation: This particular chord was the least preferred sonority and judged
clearly as subjectively least consonant, despite not being among the objectively roughest chords
16 i-Perception
of the presented stimuli. Hence, we see that enculturation indeed affects judgments of sensory
consonance or dissonance also even in single isolated chords, not just in chords within a musical
context (cf. Minati et al., 2009).
Also the difference between the perceived amount of consonance in the common pitch
class set of the added sixth and the minor seventh chords is intriguing; the added sixth chord
was perceived as more dissonant than the minor seventh chord. We surmise that this is caused
by the slightly higher amount of roughness that the added sixth chord contains when
compared with the minor seventh chord. An interesting detail is that the added sixth
chord was nonetheless perceived as more positive in valence than the minor seventh chord.
This could imply that the added sixth is more affiliated with the major triad because of its
root when compared with the minor seventh, and again suggests that enculturation affects
single chord perception in addition to psychoacoustics.
The negligible role of harmonicity in the perception of single isolated chords is somewhat
surprising, especially when considering the importance it has been given in previous research
(e.g., Cousineau et al., 2012; McDermott et al., 2010) with regard to the question of
consonance or dissonance. However, this finding is in line with Bregman (1994), who
suggests that ``harmonicity may not be critical for chord perception'' (p. 496). Also,
according to Mellinger and Mont-Reynaud (1996) the relationship between harmonicity
and the perception of harmony is a complex one, and for example, perceived pleasantness
is not necessarily completely tied to harmonicity.
Parncutt (2012) proposes that dissonance is in fact based on a combination of roughness,
harmonicity, and familiarity. If we consider chord perception encompassing also emotion
perception, Lahdelma and Eerola (2015) demonstrate a theoretical possibility of the role of
harmonicity affecting the perception of complex musical emotions conveyed by single isolated
chords. With the dimensions used in the current study, however, harmonicity does not offer any
significant explanation to account for the results. This may have to do also with the fact that the
current experiment applied only the piano timbre. According to Pierce (1999), the small
departures from perfect harmonicity are important to the piano sound; in other words,
harmonicity is presumably more important in nonpercussive, steady sounds than in
percussive, rapidly fading sounds. The role of timbre with regard to the importance of
harmonicity in single chord perception is a crucial question and should be addressed with
future experiments. Also, the question of the relationship between sensory and musical
consonance is a fascinating one: How does the perception of single chords change when
heard in different kinds of musical contexts (cf. Bharucha & Stoeckig, 1986; Krumhansl, 1990)?
We see that the possible role of pitch relations (aggregate dyadic consonance) with regard
to the perception of single isolated chords should be examined further. The role of aggregate
dyadic consonance as an explanation for why the relationship between the lack of roughness
and preference is not linear could be studied with a higher number of chord sonorities. Also,
the crucial threshold of maximum roughness in simultaneous pitch combinations resulting in
a decline of preference should be investigated.
The current results suggest that vertical harmony perception may have more to do with
horizontal harmony perception with regard to single chords than has been previously
thought; this finding is in line with Tramo et al. (2001) who point out that ``a listener's
implicit (or explicit) knowledge about harmony in the horizontal dimension bears on
harmony perception in the vertical dimension'' (p. 96). Furthermore, it is tantalizing to
draw a parallel between these two distinct aspects of harmony when considering a
historical point of view. As Parncutt (1989) points out (referring to Grout, 1960),
horizontal intervals between tones existed before simultaneous tones in music: ``History
suggests . . . that musical intervals (octaves, fifths) between sequential tones existed long
Lahdelma and Eerola 17
before people started singing or playing tones simultaneously in music . . . '' (p. 9). Could this
evolution of harmony somehow still affect the perception of vertical sonorities? The question
of how the ear parses the overall consonance of simultaneous intervals in vertical pitch
combinations or whether it does so remains to be examined with future research.

Author Biographies
Imre Lahdelma is a doctoral student in musicology at the
University of Jyva
¨ skyla
¨ , Finland. His multidisciplinary research
focuses on vertical harmony perception in terms of both
psychoacoustic qualities and emotional connotations. His
articles have been published by for example Psychology of
Music and Empirical Musicology Review. In 2015­2016
Lahdelma held a Fulbright Pre-Doctoral Fellowship (University
of Washington, USA).
Tuomas Eerola received his MA and Ph. D degrees from the
University of Jyva
¨ skyla
¨ , Finland, in 1997 and 2003. He is a
Professor of Music Cognition at the Durham University, UK.
His research interest lies within the field of music cognition and
music psychology, including musical similarity, melodic
expectations, perception of rhythm and timbre, and induction
and perception of emotions. He is on the editorial boards of
Psychology of Music, and Frontiers in Digital Humanities and is
consulting editor for Musicae Scientiae and member of the
European Cognitive Sciences of Music (ESCOM) and the Society for Education, Music
and Psychology Research (SEMPRE).
Appendix
Definitions of Each Dimension on the 5-Item Scale
This is how the scales were defined and explained to the participants in the experiment.
(1) Valence. Is the chord conveying positive or negative emotions?
(2) Tension. How tense do you think the chord is? Is it calm and relaxed or tense and
agitated?
(3) Energy. Do you think the chord is strong and energetic, or weak and feeble?
(4) Consonance. How smooth do you think the chord is?
(5) Preference. How much did you like the chord? Note that this is a purely subjective
question: for example, you may like a chord no matter how negative or harsh it sounds.
