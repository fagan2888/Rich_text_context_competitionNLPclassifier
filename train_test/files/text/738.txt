DataWatch
Each quarter, Health Affairs reports on new developments in one offour sectors of
the health sphere: health status and health care utilization in Spring, health care
innovation in Summer, national health care spending in Fall,and health personnel
in Winter. In this issue, Gerry Hendershot offers an update of health status and the
use ofmedical care in the U.S. Bruce Vladeck and colleagues ofthe United Hospital
Fund report on consumers and hospital mortality data. Finally, Allan Dobson and
Elizabeth Hoy of the Consolidated Consulting Group reassess how hospitals are
profiting under Medicare prospective payment.
Health Status And Medical Care Utilization
by Gerry E. Hendershot
This DataWatch presents selected 1986 statistics on health status and
medical care utilization by race and poverty status and compares them to
estimates for 1982, using data from the National Health Interview
Surveys (NHIS).1 The focus on statistics for minorities updates the
statistical basis for the discussion of access to medical care that has been
prominent in the pages of Health Affairs.2
Source And Limitations Of The Data
The NHIS has been conducted continuously by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) since 1957. It is based on a weekly cross-
sectional, area probability sample of households, representing the civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. The sample is
redesigned every ten years to reflect population changes.
Information is collected by personal interview in sample households
by interviewers employed and supervised by the Census Bureau. The
interviewers administer two questionnaires. The first, on public health
topics of current national interest, is revised each year. The second, on
public health topics of continuing national interest, is revised about
every ten years.
The NHIS data, like those from any interview sample survey, have

limitations. Household respondents, the source of the information, may
not be able or willing to answer accurately some questions about the
health status and medical care utilization of family members. Also,
because the data are based on a sample, not a complete enumeration,
they are subject to sampling error. To control and measure these sources
of error, fieldwork procedures are pretested and monitored, and the
sampling errors of estimated statistics are computed and published.
In addition to these continuing limitations in the NHIS data, there are
limitations on data for 1982 and 1986 presented in this report. In 1982
the core questionnaire on topics of continuing interest was extensively
redesigned to improve the completeness and accuracy of reporting on
health status and medical care utilization. While the underlying concepts
did not change, the redesign produced changes in estimates for some
statistics. For that reason, 1982 is the earliest year to which many NHIS
statistics can be compared.
Although the designed sample size of the NHIS was enlarged in 1985
from about 40,000 households annually to about 50,000 annually, bud-
get restrictions required a 50 percent reduction in designed sample size in
1986, to 25,000 households. Interviews were completed in about 24,000
sample households representing about 62,000 persons. Because the 1986
sample was relatively small, the 1986 estimates reported here are some-
what less reliable than those for other NHIS data years (including 1987,
for which a full sample was included and should be available by mid-
1988).
Health Status
Exhibit 1 shows estimates of selected measures of health status and
medical care utilization by race and poverty status for 1986, and the
differences in those estimates between 1986 and 1982. Because race and
poverty groups have different age compositions, and age is strongly
related to some measures of health status and medical care utilization,
the statistics are adjusted for age (to 1982 estimates for ages under
eighteen, eighteen to forty-four, forty-five to sixty-four, and sixty-five
and over).
Acute conditions. The NHIS defines an acute condition as a health
condition that caused a restriction in activity or physician contact in the
past two weeks, began less than three months ago, and is not considered
chronic. As shown in Exhibit 1, the age-adjusted average number of
acute conditions per 1,000 persons during 1986 ranged from 1,204 for
nonpoor black persons to 2,342 for poor white persons. (Persons were
classified as poor if their family income was below the official poverty
threshold.) Medically attended acute conditions, which are usually more
severe, followed the same pattern at a lower level.

DATAWATCH 117
For all acute conditions and for medically attended acute conditions,
poor people had higher age-adjusted rates than nonpoor people in 1986.
The poverty difference is similar within race groups, but the estimates
for minorities have relatively large sampling errors.
The NHIS age-adjusted estimates of rates of acute conditions were
higher in 1986 than in 1982, as shown by the differences between 1986
and 1982 estimates in the last three columns of Exhibit 1. This does not
reflect a long-term trend, but rather reflects annual fluctuations in the
incidence of influenza and other respiratory infections. The incidence of
these conditions was considerably higher in 1986 than it had been in
1982.3
Injuries. In the NHIS, injuries are defined as acute conditions resulting
from accidents or nonaccidental violence. The NHIS distinguishes be-
tween injuries, accidents, and episodes of persons injured. One accident
may injure more than one person, and one person may sustain more than
one injury in a single accident. An "episode of a person injured" includes
all injuries to a single person resulting from a single accident. The rate of
episodes of persons injured and the rate of such episodes that caused
restricted activity are shown in Exhibit 1.
In 1986 the age-adjusted rate of all injuries ranged from 165 per 1,000
for nonpoor black people to 376 per 1,000 for poor white people. The
pattern was similar for injuries with restricted activity, but at a lower
level. Poor people had higher age-adjusted rates of all injuries and
injuries with restricted activity, although the estimates for minority
groups are too unstable to make statistically reliable comparisons. The
differences in the injury rates between 1982 and 1986 were small and do
not indicate a significant trend.
Limitation in activity. Persons are considered to have limitations in
activity if they have chronic health conditions that cause them to limit
normal activities, such as playing, going to school, or working. A chronic
health condition is a health condition that began more than three
months ago or is commonly regarded as chronic. The age-adjusted
percentage of persons with limitations of activity is shown in Exhibit 1.
In 1986 the age-adjusted percentage of persons with limitation of
activity ranged from 10.9 percent for nonpoor Hispanic persons to 25.6
percent for poor white persons. Limitation of activity was considerably
more common among poor people than among nonpoor people, even
among persons in the same category of race. The differences between the
1986 and 1982 age-adjusted estimates of the prevalence of limitation of
activity were small and do not indicate a significant trend.
Restricted activity days. Restricted activity days are those during the
past two weeks when the sample person restricted normal activities for
more than half a day due to a health condition, either acute or chronic.
The NHIS includes data on several kinds of restricted activity days: bed

days, work-loss days, school-loss days, and "cut-down" days. Exhibit 1
shows the average number of restricted activity days of all types per 1,000
persons, age-adjusted.
In 1986 the age-adjusted average number of restricted activity days
ranged from 14.3 for nonpoor white persons to 26.6 for poor black and
white persons. Poor persons had more (age-adjusted) days of restricted
activity than nonpoor persons, although the difference has a large
sampling error for the minority groups. The differences between 1986
and 1982 in average numbers of restricted activity days were small, and
indicate no significant trend over that period.
General health. The NHIS respondents are asked to assess the general
health of household members as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.
This measure is correlated with other, more objective indicators of
health status and serves as an overall measure of general health. The age-
adjusted percentages of persons reported to be in fair or poor health are
shown in Exhibit 1.
The age-adjusted percentage of persons in fair or poor health ranged
from 7.7 percent for nonpoor white persons to 25.8 percent for poor
black persons. Fair or poor health was more prevalent among poor
persons than nonpoor persons in each of the race groups considered.
Overall and in most of the subgroups shown, the estimated percentage in
fair or poor health was somewhat lower in 1986 than it was in 1982.
Summary. For the indicators of health status, the 1986 NHIS shows
that poor people tended to be in poorer health than nonpoor people,
especially when differences in age are statistically controlled. This was
generally found for each of the major groups considered--white, black,
and Hispanic--although sampling variability in some estimates for the
minority groups must qualify that statement. Except for an increase in
acute conditions caused by an influenza epidemic and a possible slight
decrease in the percentage of persons assessed by respondents to be in fair
or poor health, there was little evidence of significant trends in health
status between 1982 and 1986.
Medical Care Utilization
The last five panels of Exhibit 1 contain NHIS estimates of age-
adjusted statistics for selected indicators of medical care utilization:
dental visits, physician contacts, and hospital stays.
Dental visits. Exhibit 1 shows the age-adjusted percentage of persons
who had one or more visits to a dentist in the year preceding their NHIS
interview in 1986, and the age-adjusted number of visits in that period.
These data show significant differences in access to dental care among
different race and poverty status groups. Among poor Hispanic persons,
only about one-third were reported to have seen a dentist, whereas three-

DATAWATCH 119
fifths of nonpoor white persons were reported to have done so. The age-
adjusted average number of visits during the year ranged from less than
one for poor black persons to over two for nonpoor white persons. There
are racial and ethnic differences in access to dental care that are indepen-
dent of poverty status: black and Hispanic persons have less access to
dental care than white persons regardless of their poverty status. The
NHIS did not collect data on dental care in 1982, but it did in 1983;
therefore, the differences shown are between 1986 and 1983. They show
some increase in access to dental care in that period.
Physician contacts. A physician contact is a telephone call or visit to
an office or clinic during which the sample person was seen or talked to
by a physician or by a health professional working under a physician's
supervision; physician contacts while a hospital inpatient are not in-
cluded in this measure. Age-adjusted estimates are shown in Exhibit 1
for two measures of physician contacts: the percentage of persons with
one or more contacts during the year before the NHIS interview, and the
average number of contacts in that period.
In 1986 there was little difference between race and poverty status
groups in the percentage who had contacted a physician during the past
year. There was a poverty status difference, however, in the average
number of contacts: poor persons had more contacts, on average, than
nonpoor persons. This implies, of course, that while poor persons were
no more likely than others to contact a physician, those poor persons
who did contact a physician at all did so considerably more often, on
average, than did nonpoor persons.
Hospitalization. The NHIS considers persons to have been hospital-
ized if they were inpatients in a hospital overnight. Exhibit 1 shows the
1986 NHIS estimates of the age-adjusted percentages of persons who
were hospitalized one or more times in the past year. It should be noted
that persons who die while hospitalized and those who are discharged to
nursing homes or other long-term care facilities are not in the household
population represented by the NHIS. Since such persons account for a
large proportion of hospitalizations, their absence from the NHIS is a
significant limitation of these data.
Exhibit 1 shows that in 1986, after age adjustment, the percentage of
noninstitutionalized poor persons who were hospitalized was consider-
ably greater than that of nonpoor persons. Between 1982 and 1986 there
was a decline in the age-adjusted percentage hospitalized during the year,
but the decline was concentrated among nonpoor persons, widening the
gap between the poor and nonpoor populations.
Summary. Compared to nonpoor persons, poor persons have less
access to dental care, but access seems to be improving for both the poor
and the nonpoor. Poor and nonpoor persons are about equally likely to
contact a physician during the year, but poor persons who do contact a

physician do so more often on average. Finally, poor persons are more
likely than nonpoor persons to be hospitalized during the year, and the
decline in the rate of hospitalization among the nonpoor is widening that
gap. Given the poorer health status of poor persons, as shown in the
preceding section, their use of physician and hospital services suggests
that they postpone medical treatment until their condition becomes
more serious and requires more extensive utilization of medical care.
Conclusion
The data from the NHIS included in this DataWatch are derived from
an extensive set of unpublished tabulations completed by NCHS for
each data year. While these tabulations are too extensive to publish or
distribute in their entirety, they are available to the public health
community on request.4 They generally become available about mid-
year of the year following data collection. Because the NHIS is based on a
large sample (including an oversample of the black population), and
because its procedures change very little from year to year, these annual
tabulations are a useful resource for tracking levels and trends in health
status and utilization of medical care in the population.
The interpretations included in this DataWatch are the author's, and do not necessarily reflect the views
of the National Center for Health Statistics.
