Abstract
Death due to motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remains a leading cause of death in the US
and alcohol plays a prominent role in a large proportion of these fatalities nationwide. Rates
for these incidents vary widely among states and over time. Here, we explore the extent to
which driving volume, alcohol consumption, legislation, political ideology, and geographical
factors influence MVC deaths across states and time. We specify structural equation mod-
els for extracting associations between the factors and outcomes for MVC deaths and com-
pute correlation functions of states' relative geographic and political positions to elucidate
the relative contribution of these factors. We find evidence that state-level variation in MVC
deaths is associated with time-varying driving volume, alcohol consumption, and legislation.
These relationships are modulated by state spatial proximity, whereby neighboring states
are found to share similar MVC death rates over the thirty-year observation period. These
results support the hypothesis that neighboring states exhibit similar risk and protective
characteristics, despite differences in political ideology.
Introduction
Human interactions within a society create complex systems, which depend on phenomena at
both individual and group levels [1]. Such systems are influenced by a variety of formal and in-
formal rules, which reflect desirable outcomes for the society and behaviors to achieve them
[2]. In this context, public policies are powerful tools, yet many aspects of their adoption and
diffusion are not well understood [3].
Over the past three decades, states in the US have expanded the use of public policies, such as
laws, regulations, taxes, and other enforcement mechanisms, to attain public health goals and to
facilitate the change of complex health behaviors [4­7]. In spite of growing evidence for the ef-
fectiveness of numerous individual laws, important public policy questions remain unanswered,
such as how different combinations of health laws and policies work in concert or at odds with

cess, and whether states that are geographically or politically similar tend to emulate one anoth-
er with regard to policies intended to tackle public health problems.
The study of complex systems [8, 9] offers novel approaches for handling large datasets. For
example, public health problems (e.g., tobacco control and pandemic flu [10­14]), the spread
of invasive species driven by the global shipping industry [15], models of energy flows evidenc-
ing climate [16], and analysis of cholera epidemics [17] have already benefitted from these ap-
proaches. Complex systems tools may be particularly beneficial for the analysis of
policymaking among states, as they allow for a quantitative understanding of the complex in-
teractions within a group of interconnected units (e.g., policymakers) who are responsible for
the production of an observable and emergent phenomenon (e.g., state health policy land-
scape) [18], for example to study the relationship between adopting mandatory seat belt laws
and preventing injury and death as a result of traffic accidents [19].
A pressing public health problem is to understand and predict the relationship between al-
cohol consumption, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), and traffic fatalities. Although traffic fa-
tality rates have been halved during the past thirty years, MVCs remain the second largest
contributor to years of life lost before age 75 in the US and are the single largest cause of death
among youth aged fifteen to twenty-four [20, 21]. Moreover, MVC-related death rates vary
widely among states, from 0.84 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles of travel in Iowa to 4.35
deaths per 100 million vehicle miles of travel in New Jersey.
Alcohol use is a major contributor to MVCs and was involved in nearly one-third of all fatal
crashes in 2009 [22]. Much of the decline in deaths over the past thirty years has been attribut-
ed to more effective state policies regulating motor vehicle safety and reducing drunk driving.
Yet, despite early progress, the rate of alcohol involvement in fatal collisions has remained near
32% since 1994 and currently ranges from about 25% in Kentucky to 48% in Hawaii [22]. In
this context, we posit that complex systems approaches may offer fundamental insight into
temporal and spatial processes underlying the persistence of this public health problem.
In this paper, we explore the dynamics of state MVC deaths and the factors associated with
changes in death rates over time. We investigate the extent to which a set of key state characteris-
tics and geographical factors influence MVC deaths. MVC deaths are measured by total counts
of deaths, rates of deaths per vehicle miles travelled, and the percentage of deaths that are alco-
hol-related. Explanatory variables comprise the driving volume (the total amount of vehicle
miles travelled in each state and year), alcohol consumption (gallons per capita), legislation (the
proportion of an ensemble of alcohol- and driving-related laws adopted), and political ideology.
The relationships between MVC deaths and explanatory variables are studied using structural
equation models (SEMs) on data from all fifty states over a recent thirty year period. SEMs are se-
lected as they enable the simultaneous measurement of relationships among multiple indepen-
dent variables and a dependent variable, which allows for assessing potential confounders
between the variables. Spatial and political measures are leveraged to determine how state geo-
graphic and ideological similarities contribute to such relationships. Based on the knowledge that
the interactions among states are able to inform their public policies, we expect to find significant
dependencies between MVC deaths and the selected variables. We further anticipate that states
that are geographically closer and ideologically similar exhibit comparable patterns.
Results
MVC outcomes and relationship to alcohol
We find that MVC deaths, denoted D, have decreased at the national level from 51,050 in 1980
to 32,788 in 2010. Most states experienced a decline over time, but overall rates varied largely

by state, see Fig 1a. This variation is further demonstrated in Fig 1b, which shows D at three
evenly spaced years in the studied thirty year period, 1980, 1995, and 2009. In this figure, D is
normalized over all states with respect to the annual maximum value; thus, the state with larg-
est D is shown with a value of 1 and the state with the smallest D is shown with a value of 0 for
each map, where numerical values are given in the color bar. We consistently see that the large
and populous states- CA, FL, and TX- have the highest number of MVC deaths. Interestingly,
although NY is both large and populous, it fails to reach similarly high values of D.
The percentage of MVC deaths involving alcohol, denoted Da
, shows similar nationwide
trends to D, decreasing from 37.0% in 1980 to 18.3% in 2010. The variation of this quantity be-
tween states is generally narrow, see Fig 1c. However, considering Da
normalized over all states
in 1980, 1995, and 2009, we see that the footprint of alcohol-related traffic deaths is more com-
plex than the previous case, see Fig 1d. The patterns among the states do not appear to be con-
stant over time, nor are they dependent on geographic location over time.
Association between MVC outcomes and potential determinants of
variation among states
We analyze four state descriptors: vehicle miles travelled (M), per capita alcohol consumption
(A), the proportion of selected laws related to reducing risky and drunk driving and increasing
driver and occupant protection (e.g. seatbelts) (L), and state ideology (I). The state ideology is
between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating most liberal political ideology. The computation of these de-
scriptors is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. These quantities are re-
ported nationwide, normalized with respect to the annual maximum values over all states, in
1980, 1995, and 2009 in Fig 2. The results from the SEMs are presented in Table 1 and summa-
rized in network form in Fig 3.
Comparing the dependence of D on M, we find significant positive associations when the
states are partitioned into decades and when they are combined over the thirty years. From this
analysis, we notice that the regression coefficients are positive and decrease in time. Neverthe-
less, such analysis using the raw number of MVC deaths does not allow for an objective com-
parison between states of varying populations and geographic sizes. Thus, we consider D/M as
the focal outcome in the rest of the analyses, which eliminates the over-emphasis of states with
higher populations or more roads.
Studying the dependence of Da
on the state characteristics, we find a significant association
with M over all decades and years and the regression coefficients change through the decades;
these negative coefficients increase towards zero over time. The association with A shows sig-
nificant positive associations over all decades and all years combined. Here, the regression coef-
ficients vary non-monotonically over the decades. Significant negative associations are found
between L and Da
when the decades are considered separately and when all years are com-
bined. The regression coefficients show a strong increase from the 1980s to the 1990s, after
which they stay approximately constant. Considering Da
's variation with I, we do not find sig-
nificant association for any decade, nor when combining all years.
Considering the association between D/M and A, L, and I, we find a significant and positive
association with A for all years combined and in the 1980s separately; for the 1990s and the
2000s, we do not find any association for the regression coefficients. We further find significant
negative associations between L and I when the decades are considered separately and when all
years are combined. The regression coefficients are negative and increase toward zero with
time, by an approximate factor of 1.5 per decade.
Among the independent factors in these two SEMs, we find a complex pattern of depen-
dence among factors and over time. Notably, we see that L has significant positive and negative

computed errors, we find that the coefficients mitigating possible time-varying confounding
factors are relatively small compared to the coefficients between pairs of factors.

Similarity analysis of state pairs
Following the analysis in Gallos et al. [23], we compute a correlation function to identify trends
between different state characteristics and the MVC outcomes for pairs of states separated by a
certain "distance". The distance between states is defined in two ways: the location of geograph-
ic state center and the political ideology of the state population. A correlation coefficient is eval-
uated for all pairs of states separated by a given distance, computed in any of the previously
defined outcomes and characteristics. Further technical details are provided in the Materials

and Methods section. Fig 4 shows the correlation function computed using geographic and
ideological distances versus D/M, Da
, M, A, and L.
Considering the left column of Fig 4, we find that the outcome D/M and characteristics
A and L show positive correlations for small geographic distances, indicating that nearby
states are more similar than states that are further apart. These short-distance correlations
vary in time, whereby D/M tends to be more correlated as time increases (greater than
one standard deviation difference in the mean values) and A displays an opposite trend.
Correlations of the state characteristics and outcomes generally decrease with increasing
geographic distances, converging near zero. In a few cases, such correlations tend to
negative values, as for D/M which attains negative values for geographic distances larger
than 0.4.
When we use ideological differences to define distances, we uncover strikingly different pat-
terns than in the previous case, see the right column of Fig 4. For no quantity except D/M do
we find any correlation among near neighbors, whereby states which are ideologically similar
display correlations near zero. Increasing the ideological distance does not produce noticeable
variations, except for D/M which attains nonnegligible negative values for distances larger than
0.3. In contrast to our analysis of geographic distances, the data variation remarkably increases
with growing distance. Such wide variations are likely due to the smaller number of state pairs
which are ideologically very dissimilar, see Fig 5.
Discussion
This study supports the hypothesis that MVC deaths are associated with a set of policy and en-
vironmental factors, which explains a large proportion of state variations in outcomes. More-
over, these factors (i.e., M, A, and L) are modified by state characteristics and are influenced by
geographic proximity and less so by ideological differences, as demonstrated through the
SEM results.
Our results confirm the notion that the main measure of risk of an MVC is the amount of
time spent driving and suggest that, in spite of increased driving volume, the risk of MVC
deaths has decreased over the past three decades. One explanation for this trend has been the
increased attention towards the design of safer vehicles [24]. However, our findings support
the importance of regulations promoting safer driving behavior in reducing MVC deaths. Spe-
cifically, we find that MVC death rate and the proportion of those related to alcohol are nega-
tively associated with the number of laws aimed at reducing drunk driving and promoting
driver and passenger safety. Similarly, we observe that MVC deaths per miles travelled de-
creases as the state political ideology grows more liberal, although liberal states do not necessar-
ily have a larger number of laws.
We also confirm that the percentage of alcohol-related MVC deaths increases with per
capita alcohol consumption [25] in line with intuitive expectations. Interestingly, we further
observe that the alcohol-related MVC deaths are negatively associated with driving volume,
whereby in states where the amount of driving is higher, the percentage of alcohol-related
MVC deaths is lower. This evidence is unlikely to be explained by variations in the legisla-
tion across states, since we find no association between the driving volume and the number
of laws.
Considering results from the geographic analysis, we find that states' physical proximity
is a predictor of MVC deaths, whereby states that are close by tend to have similar MVC
deaths per unit vehicle mile. Likely, this reflects the composition of the transportation infra-
structure in the US, where high density urban centers are connected through interstate high-
ways and smaller shared roads, while low traffic volume areas are connected to similar

areas. However, the role of physical proximity appears to be secondary in explaining state
differences in alcohol-related deaths. The negative correlation between alcohol-related MVC
deaths and traffic volume may be related to the lack of correlation we observe between traffic
volume in physically proximal states. It may indicate that alcohol-related MVC deaths are
associated with specific driving patterns involving smaller travel distances [26].
Another explanation for the importance of physical distances on MVC deaths is the finding
that proximal states have similar legal environments. The political science literature suggests
that, all else equal, states are more likely to adopt laws that have been successful in another
state because this simplifies policymakers' task of finding a solution to a given problem [27,
28]. There are several reasons why states should cooperate on laws regarding traffic fatalities.
First, roads and highways cross state borders, necessitating communication and coordination
among law enforcement agencies and state departments of transportation. Second, policy-
makers and policy analysts in neighboring states may have opportunities to learn from one

another through regional associations and conferences or other formal mechanisms to ex-
change information. They may also be more willing to look to neighboring states for solutions
to policy problems because of regional similarities in populations, geography, or economic cir-
cumstances. We note that state proximity also predicts similar patterns of alcohol consump-
tion, reflecting an underlying risk factor for MVC deaths. This could also be a result of the fact
that geographically contiguous states necessarily share some aspects of their legal environ-
ments, including alcohol, taxes, and sales restriction.
In contrast with our expectations, our results indicate that political ideology is less predic-
tive of MVC deaths than geography and appears to exert an influence only for states which are
ideologically very different. Specifically, states with different ideologies tend to be negatively
correlated in their MVC deaths, suggesting that differences in political ideology may be associ-
ated with additional risk or protective factors for MVC deaths. One specific pathway identified
through the SEM is that more liberal ideology is positively associated with greater laws in-
tended to regulate behaviors which may explain its indirect effect on outcomes in different
state contexts.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MVC deaths in US are related to multiple factors,
spanning citizens' and policy makers' behaviors as well as inherent geographical and ideologi-
cal factors determining state relationships. Moreover, influencing factors are somewhat differ-
ent for MVC deaths overall compared to MVC deaths related to alcohol. This complexity hints
at the need for stimulating further interdisciplinary research to elucidate the interplay between
similarity and dissimilarity across states in shaping public health problems in the US.
Materials and Methods
Datasets
The study uses data from the State Health Policy Research Dataset (SHePRD), which includes
traffic and alcohol policies from all 50 states 1980­2010 [29]. SHePRD is publicly available
through ICPSR and includes data retrieved, validated, standardized, and merged from public
use datasets, as well as original legal research. The data included in analysis of vehicle miles
travelled, and state alcohol consumption are obtained from the NHTSA. MVC deaths per state
come from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). MVC deaths are taken as total counts
of annual deaths per state and the percentage of deaths that are alcohol-related. Total vehicle
miles travelled is the statewide annual sum of the average amount of time motor vehicles are
on the road multiplied by the length of roadway. This measure takes into account both the
types of vehicles and the types of roadways on which they typically drive and it is officially
computed for each state by the NHTSA. Alcohol consumption is the annual gallons of alcohol
sold per capita. Laws were selected for inclusion in the dataset if there was evidence of their ef-
fectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality in the literature. Binary variables in the dataset
indicate the presence or absence of each law in each state and year during the study period and
the proportion of these laws adopted (ranging from zero to one) is taken as an annual
state descriptor.
State ideology measures the average location of the elected officials in each state on a liberal-
conservative continuum based on weighted ideology scores for the governor and the major
party delegations in each house of the state legislature derived from interest group ratings,
opinion polls, and roll call data. The scale ranges from zero (representing the most conservative
value) to one hundred (representing the most liberal position) and directly follows the proce-
dure in [27]. However, this quantity is normalized between zero and one for the purposes of
this study. We used the haversine formula to compute the distances between state geographic

centers; Alaska and Hawaii were excluded from this calculation since they would result in arti-
ficially large distances. Statistics on the data used for the analysis are given in Table 2.
Analysis and statistics
We specify three structural equation models [30] to extract the associations between state char-
acteristics and outcomes with p-values less than 0.01 and 0.05 used for significance; these mod-
els are shown in Eqs (1), (2), and (3) below. To ensure the feasibility of this analysis, and in
particular that the covariance matrix of all variables is well-conditioned, we normalize each
variable (D, Da
, M, A, L, and I) between zero and one by dividing each variable by its largest
value over the thirty year interval. The normalization allows us to compare the relative highs
and lows of the variables with each other and, as a result, we expect that the trends we find are
valid for both the scaled and unscaled data. The consistency of behavior in the raw and normal-
ized data can be seen by comparing rows in Table 2.
The three SEMs consider the state characteristics and outcomes as measured variables,
which may be influenced by error terms defined as exogenous latent variables. This formu-
lation is a special case of the general SEM called a simultaneous equation model [31]. In
addition to the linear relationships between the measured variables, each model contains a
constant intercept term to account for a constant off-set between the variables in the re-
gression analysis [32]. The models are specified as follows. The dependence of D on M is
computed using a SEM with the following straightforward equation defined for each state:
D

¼ aM

where Di
is the normalized raw number of MVC deaths in year i, Mi
is the normalized vehi-
cle miles travelled in year i, 2i
is a time-varying error, and , , and  are the coefficients
computed by the SEM. The dependence of Da
on all the state characteristics, and their in-
terdependences, are computed using a SEM which simultaneously regresses the system of

For each variable, means are taken over the states and years and standard deviations are taken of the mean state values over the years. Results are
shown as mean ± one standard deviation. We comment the normalized data is dimensionless and takes values between zero and one, while the raw data
is dimensional following the definitions of the characteristics and outcomes.

 is the delta symbol taking the value one if its argument is zero and being zero otherwise, and
i,j = 1,. . .,50. We note that the argument of the  function is equal to zero when the distance be-
tween state i and state j is equal to the target distance set by the argument of the C function. As
with the correlation coefficient, large magnitude values indicate a strong correlation and values
close to zero indicate a weak correlation. However, C(r) may take values greater than one, since
the mean and variance are taken over all states, but the delta function selects only a subset of
these as summands. To facilitate comparison of results using both geographic and ideological
distances, we normalize the pairwise distances between 0 and 1 by dividing all distances by the
largest value in each case. The normalized distances are combined in eleven equal bins, and the
largest four bins are merged to lessen the effect of data sparseness at large distances. This analy-
sis is performed with the computing software MATLAB, version 2013b. We note that this cor-
relation analysis is performed on the un-normalized values of each variable.
