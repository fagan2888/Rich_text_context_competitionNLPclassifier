Abstract
Background: Prolonged sitting is an emerging health risk. However, multi-country comparative sitting data are
sparse. This paper reports the prevalence and correlates of sitting time in 32 European countries.
Methods: Data from the Eurobarometer 64.3 study were used, which included nationally representative samples
(n = 304-1,102) from 32 European countries. Face-to-face interviews were conducted during November and
December 2005. Usual weekday sitting time was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(short-version). Sitting time was compared by country, age, gender, years of education, general health status, usual
activity and physical activity. Multivariable-adjusted analyses assessed the odds of belonging to the highest sitting
quartile.
Results: Data were available for 27,637 adults aged 15­98 years. Overall, mean reported weekday sitting time was
309 min/day (SD 184 min/day). There was a broad geographical pattern and some of the lowest amounts of daily
sitting were reported in southern (Malta and Portugal means 194­236 min/day) and eastern (Romania and
Hungary means 191­276 min/day) European countries; and some of the highest amounts of daily sitting were
reported in northern European countries (Germany, Benelux and Scandinavian countries; means 407­335 min/day).
Multivariable-adjusted analyses showed adults with low physical activity levels (OR = 5.10, CI95
= 4.60-5.66), those
with high sitting in their main daily activity (OR = 2.99, CI95
= 2.74-3.25), those with a bad/very bad general health
state (OR = 1.87, CI95
= 1.63-2.15) and higher education levels (OR = 1.48, CI95
= 1.38-1.59) were more likely to be
in the highest quartile of daily sitting time. Adults within Greece (OR = 2.91, CI95
= 2.51-3.36) and Netherlands
(OR = 2.56, CI95
= 2.22-2.94) were most likely to be in the highest quartile. High-sit/low-active participants comprised
10.1% of the sample. Adults self-reporting bad/very bad general health state (OR = 4.74, CI95
= 3.97-5.65), those within
high sitting in their main daily activities (OR = 2.87, CI95
= 2.52-3.26) and adults aged 65 years (OR = 1.53, CI95
=
1.19-1.96) and were more likely to be in the high-sit/low-active group.
Conclusions: Weekday sitting time and its demographic correlates varied considerably across European countries,
with adults in north-western European countries sitting the most. Sitting is prevalent across Europe and merits
attention by preventive interventions.

Background
Sedentary behaviour (too much sitting as opposed to too
little exercise) has recently emerged as a candidate inde-
pendent risk factor associated with several detrimental
health outcomes [1,2]. Sedentary behaviours are defined as
any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expend-
iture 1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture
[3,4]. High volumes of time spent sitting or engaged in se-
dentary behaviour have been associated with an increased
risk of all-cause mortality [5-7] and risk of developing type
2 diabetes [8], obesity [9-11] and cardiovascular disease
[12-15]. Importantly, in some studies these associations
with mortality and health have occurred irrespective of
whether an individual meets the core adult physical activity
recommendation of 150 minutes of at least moderate-
intensity physical activity per week [5,7,16-18]. Several
international health authorities have recently provided for-
mal recommendations citing the importance of reducing
sitting time [19-21].
Until recently, public health surveillance has prima-
rily focused on understanding the distribution of popu-
lation leisure-time physical activity (e.g. structured
moderate-to-vigorous-intensity exercise) [22,23] and
active travel (e.g. walking and cycling for transporta-
tion) [24,25]. The lack of population studies assessing
sitting time was recently highlighted by the recent Lan-
cet Series on physical activity [26]. One of the potential
reasons for the insufficient population data on sitting
time may be that it has been considered as a chronic
disease risk factor for less than a decade [27]. Moreover,
until recently, there has been a lack of consistency in
measurement instruments used to assess sitting time and
hence it is difficult to compare sitting time across coun-
tries [28]. The International Physical Activity Question-
naire (IPAQ) assesses self-reported sitting time. It has
been shown to have acceptable reliability and validity
[29,30] and is therefore applicable for use in population
studies. The IPAQ has two versions, a long and short ver-
sion, and each have recently been used in several large-
scale multi-country physical activity surveillance studies
[28,31,32].
The International Prevalence Study (IPS) of physical acti-
vity is one of the few population studies that examined the
prevalence and correlates of sitting time concurrently across
several countries [28]. In this 20 country comparison, the
mean daily weekday sitting time, assessed using the IPAQ
short version, for the overall sample (N = 49,493; age range
18­65 years) was 346 minutes/day [28]. These sitting times
differed from smaller scale single-country studies that have
used the IPAQ sitting time question. For example, in a study
of 1,200 Belgium adults (aged 20­65 years), mean sitting
time was 421 minutes/day [33]. Additionally, a study of
2,000 German adults (aged 49.3 ± 17.3 years) using the Glo-
bal Physical Activity Questionnaire identified that median
daily sitting time was 300 minutes/day [34]. Even though
the IPS used a harmonized instrument, there were consid-
erable between-country variations in sitting time [28]. For
example, adults within Japan and Saudi Arabia reported
approximately double the median daily sitting (~360 mi-
nutes per/day) than those from Portugal and Brazil
(~180 minutes/day). Furthermore, the IPS study identified
that high volumes of sitting were more prevalent among
younger adults (18­39 years) and those with greater than
13 years of education [28].
Examining how sitting time differs across levels of phys-
ical activity may also warrant attention. For example, within
populations there may be sub-groups who engage in dispar-
ate patterns of sitting and physical activity. Of particular
interest for public health surveillance may be adults classi-
fied as high-sitting/low-active, which reflects the combined
risks of sitting and inactivity. Therefore, as an alternative to
examining sitting and physical activity in isolation, it is of
interest to examine how sitting time differs according to
physical activity levels. However, at present few studies have
examined how sitting and physical activity levels differ
within populations and within different sociodemographic
groups and across countries.
There is a need to report cross-country population sit-
ting data [26]. Such research is important because this will
provide international and national public health policy
and health services with current sitting data for tracking
trends and geographical patterns of sitting time, identify-
ing `at risk' populations, and informing evidence-based ap-
proaches to reducing sitting.
The primary aim of this study is to describe the preva-
lence and correlates of daily sitting time among a large rep-
resentative sample of adults from 32 European countries,
and to assess between and within country variations. A
secondary aim is to examine the prevalence and correlates
of high-sit/low-active populations within the sample.
Methods
Recruitment and participants
Data were drawn from the Eurobarometer 64.3 (EB 64.3).
The Eurobarometer survey series, running since 1970, is a
cross-national longitudinal study designed to compare and
gauge trends within Europe. The Eurobarometer survey is
typically carried out each autumn and spring [35]. The
Eurobarometer 64.3 was conducted between November-
December 2005 and assessed a number of factors, inclu-
ding health questions. Field work for the study was carried
out by a consortium of market and public opinion re-
search agencies, requested by the European Commission,
Directorate-General Press and Communication, Opinion
Polls (see http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/
studies/4590 for further information on EB 64.3). Data
from the Eurobarometer survey series are publicly access-
ible. With the exception of using the data for commercial

purposes, the reproduction of Eurobarometer data is autho-
rized [35]. The applicable EB 64.3 survey methods are
described in at http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/
index_en.htm. The European Commission approved the
protocols and written informed consent from all partici-
pants was obtained [35]. Eurobarometer 64.3 utilized a
multistage random sampling design in all countries, and
all interviews were conducted face-to-face in people's
homes, in the national language. Computer-assisted per-
sonal interview (CAPI) was used in countries where that
technique was available and, where unavailable, paper-
based surveys were conducted [35]. Sample sizes within
countries ranged from 304 (Northern Ireland) to 1,102
(France), with a total of 29,131 participants. The average
response rate across countries for the face-to-face inter-
views was 54.6% [35].
Measures and data management
The IPAQ short version was used to assess usual weekday
sitting and physical activity [29,30]. For sitting time, a
question was asked as follows: During the last seven days,
how much time did you usually spend sitting on a week-
day? The weekday was chosen to reflect habitual behav-
iour for the short IPAQ instrument (www.ipaq.ki.se),
which has been identified to have acceptable reliability
and validity for assessing usual sitting time [30]. The sit-
ting data were truncated at 960 minutes/day (16 hours),
under the assumption that an otherwise healthy ambula-
tory adult would be mobile for at least 8 hrs each day (e.g.
light-intensity walking from place to place, around the
house, at work etc.). A total of 68 out of 27,637 cases
(0.2%) were truncated for reporting sitting >960 minutes/
day. As shown in Table 1, the mean, median and inter-
quartile range of daily sitting times were generally con-
cordant across categories. Therefore, to aid interpretation
of results, we report these sitting data as means of usual
weekday sitting time. The sitting data were also presented
in quartiles: 1) 0­179; 2) 180­299; 3) 300­419; and 4)
420­960 mins/day.
Physical activity was assessed using six items in the
IPAQ short version, which asked about frequency and
duration of vigorous intensity, moderate intensity and
walking physical activity. The questionnaire was scored
using established methods (www.ipaq.ki.se). We classi-
fied participants into three levels of physical activity:
high-, moderate-, and low-active groups. The activity
category `high' given to participants who met either of
the following two criteria: a) vigorous-intensity activity
on at least 3 days achieving a minimum total physical
activity of at least 1500 MET-minutes/week; or b) 7 or
more days of any combination of walking, moderate-
intensity or vigorous-intensity activities achieving a
minimum total physical activity of at least 3000 MET-
minutes/week. The pattern of activity to be classified as
`moderate' was meeting either of the following three cri-
teria: a) 3 or more days of vigorous-intensity activity of at
least 20 minutes per day; b) 5 or more days of moderate-
intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per
day; or c) 5 or more days of any combination of walking,
moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achiev-
ing a minimum total physical activity of at least 600 MET-
minutes/week. Participants who did not meet criteria for
categories `moderate' or `high' were considered to have a
`low' physical activity level (www.ipaq.ki.se). These physical
activity and sitting time assessments have been shown to
have acceptable reliability and validity [29,30].
Usual daily sitting time was compared across the 32 par-
ticipating European Union countries. To examine whether
sitting time varied across sociodemographic factors, sitting
data were compared across the following explanatory vari-
ables: gender; age in six categories (15­24, 25­34, 35­44,
45­54, 55­64, and 65 yrs and older); years of education in
two categories (18 yrs and less, and 19 yrs and over); phys-
ical activity level in three categories, (low-, moderate-, and
high-active); self-reported general state of health in four
categories (very good, good, neither good nor bad and
bad/very bad); and main activity in three categories:1) low
sitting occupations (responsible for ordinary shopping,
unemployed, unskilled manual worker, fisherman, skilled
manual worker and farmer); 2) mixed sitting occupations
(student, retired, unable to work, supervisor); and 3) high
sitting occupations (employed position at desk, general
management, employed professional middle management,
professional employed travelling position, owner of a
shop, craftsmen and service job).
We examined the distribution of sitting time across
sociodemographic factors and countries among specific sub-
groups at the highest/lowest risk based on physical activity
and sitting time. For these analyses, we used the three phys-
ical activity categories described above: low-, moderate-, and
high-active. In parallel, the sitting data was divided into
three groups based on quartiles of sitting time: low-sit (low-
est quartile: 0­211 minutes/day); medium-sit (quartiles two
and three combined: 211­419 minutes/day); and high-sit
(highest quartile: 420­960 minutes/day). The information
from physical activity level and sitting time was used to
categorise the sample as: 1) high-sit/low-active; 2) low-sit
/high-active; and 3) neither high-sit/low-active nor low-sit
/high-active. A total of 2,779 out of 27,637 (10.1% of the
total sample) were classified as high-sit/low-active, and
3,134 (11.3%) were categorised as low-sit/high-active, lea-
ving a total of 21,742 (78.6%) participants classified as nei-
ther high-sit/low-active nor low-sit/high-active.
Statistical analysis
Data analyses were conducted using SAS software, Ver-
sion 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows. Data on sitting
were analysed using parametric analyses for normally

distributed data. Sitting data were presented as means and
medians for usual daily sitting time with 95% confidence in-
tervals (CI). Also, the interquartile range and quartiles of
sitting time were reported to reflect increasing categories of
sitting time. Independent t-tests were used to assess
whether sitting time differed by gender and by education
level. A one-way ANOVA was performed with Scheffs
post-hoc test to examine whether sitting time differed be-
tween levels of age, occupational category, physical activity
level, general health and country. A Pearson's chi-squared
test examined whether there were differences by country
and selected sociodemographic factors among participants
classified within the high-sit/low-active or low-sit/high-active
sub-groups. A significance level (alpha) for the one-way
ANOVA, independent t-tests and Pearson's chi-squared test
was 0.05.
A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the odds
of belonging to the highest quartile of sitting time. Ad-
justed odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were
reported for these analyses. The response variable was di-
chotomous and indicated if a participant belonged to the
highest quartile of sitting time (420­960 minutes/day) or
quartiles one to three of sitting time (0­419 (minutes/day).
The model included the explanatory variables: gender (re-
ference = "Male"); education level (reference = "18 years
and less"); age (reference = "15-24 years"); occupation ca-
tegory (reference = "low-sitting"); physical activity level
(reference = "high-active"); general state of health (refe-
rence = "very good") and country (relative to the mean
odds for all countries analysed). In separate logistic regres-
sion models, we assessed the odds of belonging to the
"high-sit/low-active" group and the odds of belonging to
the "low-sit/high-active" group. Except for physical activity
level, the model included the same explanatory variables
used in the previous logistic regression analyses.
Results
Information on the Eurobarometer 64.3, sampling and re-
sponse rates have been described [35]. In brief, data were
available for 29,193 adults aged 15­98 years from 32
European countries. For the sitting time question, data
were missing for 1,556 participants (5.3% of total sample)
and, therefore, the analyses included 27,637 participants.
Descriptive data on usual weekday sitting time are
presented for the total sample, by country and selected
sociodemographic factors (Table 1). Significant diffe-
rences were observed within each sub-group across all
sociodemographic factors and by country. Mean week-
day sitting time for the total sample was 309 minutes/
day (SD = 185 minutes/day), equating to 5­6 hours of
sitting per day. Males reported a higher mean weekday
sitting time than females, and younger people (15­
24 years) had higher sitting times when compared to
older people (25 years). Participants with 18 years of

education reported lower weekday sitting times than adults
with 19 years of education. There was an inverse relation-
ship between physical activity level and usual weekday sit-
ting time. Adults in the high-active category reported
lower weekday sitting times than those in the moderate
group, who reported less than those within the low-active
category. Adults who reported their general health to be
neither good nor bad had the lowest sitting times, whereas
adults who reported having bad/very bad general health
reported the highset mean sitting times. There were diffe-
rences in sitting time by usual activity with those within
high sitting usual activates reporting the highest sitting,
followed by mixed sitting activities. There was a large vari-
ation in mean sitting times between countries. Adults from
the Netherlands, Denmark, Czech Republic and Greece
reported the highest mean sitting times (376­407 minutes/
day), while those from Romania, Portugal, Malta and
Lithuania reported the lowest mean sitting times (191­
236 minutes/day) (Table 1).
The cross-country distributions of proportions of adults
within the highest quartile of sitting time (420­960 mi-
nutes/day) are shown in Figure 1. A geographical pattern
was observed with greater proportions of north-western
European countries having 30% of the sample in the
highest quartile. In contrast, countries within south-eastern
Europe generally typically had the lowest proportions within
the highest quartile (Figure 1).
Multivariable-adjusted analyses for the odds of being in
the highest sitting quartile are shown in Table 2. Females
(OR = 0.75, CI95
= 0.71-0.80) were less likely to be in the
highest sitting quartile. Those in the low active (OR = 5.10,
CI95
= 4.60-5.66) and moderate activity group (OR = 2.78,
CI95
= 2.53-3.06) were more likely to be in the highest sitting
quartile, compared with the high active group. Compared to
adults reporting very good health, those who reported their
general health as neither good nor bad (OR = 1.28, CI95
=
1.15-1.42) and bad/very bad (OR = 1.87, CI95
= 1.63-2.15)
were more likely to be in the highest sitting quartile. Com-
pared to low sit usual activities, those in high sit (OR = 2.99,
CI95
= 2.74-3.25) and mixed sitting activities (OR = 1.36,
CI95
= 1.21-1.52) were more likely to report high levels of sit-
ting. Adults within Greece (OR = 2.91, CI 2.51-3.36) and the
Netherlands (OR = 2.56, CI95

Table 3 shows the distributions of high-sit/low-active and
low-sit/high-active groups across socio-demographic groups
and countries. A larger proportion of the sample was classi-
fied as low-sit/high-active compared with high-sit/low-active
(10.1% vs. 11.3%). Significant differences were observed
within each sub-group across all sociodemographic factors
and by country. There greater proportions of males than fe-
males in both the high-sit/low-active group and low-sit
/high-active sub-group. Adults aged 65 years and over com-
prised the largest proportion of the high-sit/low-active sub-
group. Adults who reported their general health as bad/very
bad had the highest proportions in the high-sit/low-active
group, and the lowest proportion in the low-sit/high-active
group. A higher proportion of adults with 19 years of edu-
cation were in the high-sit/low-active group, whereas a
higher proportion of those with 18 years of education were
found to be classified as low-sit/high-active. Across coun-
tries, although in some cases the sample sizes were small,
the countries with the largest proportion of their sample
within the high-sit/low-active group were Cyprus (Republic),
Cyprus (TCC) and Croatia. Romania, Germany East and
Bulgaria had the largest proportions within the low-sit/high-
active group (Table 3).
Multivariable-adjusted analyses for the odds of being in
the high-sit/low-active or low-sit/high-active sub-groups
are shown in Table 4. Adults who reported their general
health as bad/very bad had the highest odds of being in the
high-sit/low-active (OR = 4.74, CI95
= 3.97-5.65), while
these adults were less likely to be classified as low-sit/high
active (OR = 0.43, CI95
= 0.35-0.52). Compared to adults
with 18 years or less of education, those with 19 years or
more education (OR = 1.27, CI95
= 1.15-1.41) were more
likely to be in the high-sit/low-active. Higher educated

Discussion
This paper examined the prevalence and correlates of
weekday sitting time among a large sample of European
adults of the 32 Eurobarometer-participating countries.
Population-based multi-country studies of sitting preva-
lence that use standardised instruments are scarce. Our
study is the first, to our knowledge, to provide a com-
prehensive comparison of sitting prevalence across a
large cross-section of European countries.
The key finding of our analysis of the Eurobarometer
64.3 was that IPAQ assessed usual weekday sitting time
was geographically distributed, with countries within
north-western Europe generally reporting higher sitting
times than countries situated within south-eastern Europe
(Figure 1). Within the scope of the present study it is pos-
sible only to speculate on the causes of this geographical
pattern. However, an explanatory factor may be the un-
equal distribution of wealth between the more affluent

north-western countries, when compared to less wealthy
south-eastern Europe countries. Wealth inequalities could
theoretically influence sitting time across all sitting domains
(e.g. occupation, transport, leisure-time and household).
Within the occupational setting, it is likely north-western
countries have greater proportions of adults in white collar,
office-based occupations (which require greater volumes of
sitting), and greater exposure to technology at work (e.g.
computers and other labour saving devices). Moreover, un-
equal wealth disruptions across Europe may result in
greater proportions of passive transport (car use). For ex-
ample, when compared to south-eastern Europe countries,
north-western countries may be more likely to have build-
ing and transportation practices that require car use for
most trips, [36]. Within the household domain, it is also
possible that those within north-western countries have
greater access to labour-saving devices and technology
(e.g. internet, electronic entrainment) [36]. Although these
data were collected in a similar time-frame (November-
December 2005), it is possible that climatic factors may
partially explain differences in sitting times across coun-
tries. For example, northern European countries tend to
be in the highest quartile of sitting time, where the climate
is colder than in southern European countries where
fewer people belonged to the highest quartile. Further-
more, cultural differences in interpreting sitting questions
and reporting biases may have contributed to some of the
differences in sitting time between countries [37].

The present study showed that usual weekday sitting time
among 32 European countries was 309 minutes/day. This
daily sitting time was slightly lower than what was observed
by the IPS which reported a mean sitting time of 346 mi-
nutes/day [28]. When compared to population studies
using objective assessment instruments, sitting time may be
underestimated by self-report measurements [38,39]. For
example, sitting data from the IPS and Eurobarometer 64.3
indicated that adults self-reported 5­6 hrs of sitting per
day. However, accelerometer data from several national
population representative samples has shown daily seden-
tary time to be 8.8-11.2 h/day [13,40-42]. Despite the dis-
parity between objective and subjective tools, it is not clear
whether the prevalence of sitting observed in this study are
harmful to health because at present there is no consensus
among researchers surrounding the dose­response rela-
tionship between sitting and detrimental health outcomes
[43,44]. In parallel with the wide variations in physiological
adaptations to exercise training [45], it is likely that the dose
and volume of sitting and associated health consequences
differs from individual to individual [45,46]. Moreover, the
way sitting time is accrued within the context of a whole
day may be important [47]. Recently, controlled laboratory
studies further examined the acute cardiometabolic effects
of breaking up prolonged sedentary time [47,48]. In these
experiments, when prolonged sitting was displaced with
light- or moderate-intensity walking, there was a significant
lowering of postprandial glucose and insulin levels [47], and
improved whole-body insulin sensitivity [48].
The adjusted analyses identified that being low-active,
being in poor health and having high sitting usual activ-
ities were among the strongest correlates of reporting high
sitting time. These findings are somewhat similar to other
studies [28,33,34]. For education, our results and those
from the IPS [28], suggest that high levels of education are
associated with higher levels of sitting. This result may be
explained by the fact that those with higher education
levels may have occupations that require higher volumes
of sitting. Although we assessed sitting time in a some-
what younger population than the IPS study (EB 64.3:
15 years vs. IPS: 18 years), both studies show a trend
for younger people to report higher sitting times. Potential
explanations may be that in contrast to older adults, a
greater proportion of younger adults may be students,
which may require high sitting volumes [28,49,50]. More-
over, despite younger adults having a greater amount of
leisure time, time use studies have shown that 85-90% of
their leisure time is spent sedentary [49,50]. Last, younger
adults may be less likely to household activities (which are
often not sedentary) [50]. These self-report data on sitting
time and its relationship to age are to some extent incon-
sistent with studies using objective physical activity assess-
ment tools. For example, in the U.S. population NHANES
2003­2004 study, accelerometer-defined sedentary time
showed a linear trend, with sitting times increasing with in-
creasing age [13]. However, a potential explanation of these
inconsistent findings may be the age differences of the par-
ticipants assessed in the EB 64.3 (15-18 years) and NHANES
2003­2004 participants (>20 years). A recent review of
population studies assessing accelerometer-defined seden-
tary time of Belgian adults and children (n = 2,083) showed
that those aged between15-18 years had the highest levels of
sedentary time when compared to other age groups [51].
These conflicting findings highlight the need for further re-
search that objectively assesses cross-country sedentary time
within population-representative samples and among a wide
variety of age groups.
The findings around sitting time and physical activity
levels are consistent with previous research, with the IPS
study showing a similar inverse relationship between sitting
time and levels of physical activity [28]. This finding differs
from some small-scale research using objective assessments
of physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns. For ex-
ample, when accelerometer-assessed physical activity and
sedentary time were examined among participants in short-
term exercise studies, those engaging in high levels of
moderate-to-vigorous exercise may compensate for high ac-
tivity levels by being more sedentary during non-exercise pe-
riods [52,53], resulting in no net gain in energy expenditure
[54]. While the present study does not support this hypoth-
esis, it may be possible that adults reporting high physical
activity levels may under report their sitting time. The pos-
sible compensation for increased sitting time among adults
with high levels of physical activity warrants further investi-
gation in population-representative samples. Furthermore,
objective assessments tools, such as accelerometers and in-
clinometers, should be used to examine relationships be-
tween sitting and physical activity behaviour patterns.
However, population studies that implement objective phys-
ical activity assessment tools have significant cost and logis-
tical issues [13].
A novel aspect of this study was the description of the
high-sit/low-active and low-sit/high-active specific sub-
groups within the Eurobarometer 64.3 sample, which
reflects the combined risks of sitting and levels of physical
activity. The cross-country distributions of these sub-
groups suggested another potential geographical pattern.
There was a greater tendency for adults from north-
western European countries to be classified as high-sit/low-
active. In contrast, those within south-eastern countries
were more likely to be classified as low-sit/high-active.
While this trend requires replication, this geographical pat-
tern suggests that adults within north-western European
countries may be at risk of health consequences associated
with a combination of high volumes of sitting and low
levels of physical activity. Another observation was that
some countries that scored high on sitting prevalence
(Netherlands, Denmark, West-Germany), scored relatively
Bennie et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:107 Page 10 of 13
http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/107
low in the high-sit/low-active category. This seems to indi-
cate higher levels of physical activity in these countries,
which might be partly due to the good active transportation
infrastructure in these countries. In contrast, Great Britain
which has poorer active transportation infrastructure scored
much higher on the high-sit/low-active category. More edu-
cated adults were classified more frequently as high-sit/low-
active, and less frequently as low-sit/high-active. These
findings differ from previous research examining physical
activity levels without relation to sitting time. Research has
consistently shown a positive association between increased
education levels and high physical activity levels [23,55]. Al-
though the analyses adjusted for usual activities, this finding
may be explained by higher educated adults employed in
occupations that require higher volumes of sitting. Future
studies should continue to assess sitting and physical acti-
vity patterns concurrently. Research examining the preva-
lence and correlates of high-sit/low-active individuals may
be used to target at risk populations in intervention studies.
Strengths of this study include the recruitment of a large
sample of adults across a large number of European coun-
tries. This resulted in a reasonably heterogonous sample,
making it possible to compare sitting data across various
sociodemographic factors. A further strength was the use
of a standardised sitting time assessment instrument, which
makes it possible to compare the findings of the present
study to future research. Limitations include the cross-
sectional design, which makes it difficult to infer causality
from the study findings. Moreover, given that the modest
response rate of 54.6%, there may be limitations around the
generalisability of these results. Further limitations included
the use of self-report measures of sitting and physical activ-
ity, which may result in social desirability and recall biases
[56]. Furthermore, it is also possible that those who partici-
pated in the study may have different sitting patterns than
non-participants. Therefore, these factors might have
resulted in the under-reporting of sitting time, which may
suggest our estimates of sitting time in Europe are on the
conservative side. However, given the large sample size
across a wide-variety of countries, objective sitting and phys-
ical activity assessments (e.g. accelerometers and inclinome-
ters) were too difficult to implement due to high cost,
logistical issues and participant burden. Furthermore, des-
pite limitations around the validity of self-reported methods,
among large samples, standardised self-report tools have a
use for ranking individuals sitting time and physical activity
levels [57].
Conclusion
With emerging evidence suggesting that high volumes of
sitting may be an independent health risk factor, there is a
need to describe the prevalence of population levels of sit-
ting. However, large-scale multi-country sitting surveil-
lance studies are scarce. The Eurobarometer 64.3 survey
provided a unique opportunity to examine the prevalence
of sitting time among a population sample of adults from
32 European countries. This paper identified a large vari-
ation in sitting time across European countries, with indi-
cations that populations in north-western Europe sit the
most. Moreover, high sitting volumes were more prevalent
among males, younger age groups, low-active adults, and
those with higher education levels. Given the recent trend
for technological and societal advancements across deve-
loped and developing countries, sitting is, and will become
increasingly entrenched in many modern lifestyles. Regu-
lar public health surveillance studies using consistent
methods and survey instruments on population sitting
levels should be a priority for national and international
health departments.
