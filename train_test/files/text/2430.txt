American Indians, Substance Use, and Sexual Behavior:
Do Predictors of Sexually Transmitted Infections
Explain the Race Gap Among Young Adults?
David Eitle, PhD, Kaylin Greene, PhD, and Tamela McNulty Eitle, PhD
Background: In this study, we examined whether substance use and
risky sexual behaviors predicted sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
among American Indian (AI) and white young adults. Furthermore, we ex-
plored whether these factors explained the race disparity in STIs.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of wave 3 of the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health collected in 2001 to
2002. Young adult participants (aged 18­26 years) provided urine speci-
mens that were tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis infec-
tion. Estimates of the association between AI with any STI were adjusted
for sexual and other risk behavior correlates using multivariate regression
techniques.
Results: Nine percent of AIs (n = 367) and 3.6% of whites (n = 7813)
tested positive for an STI. Race differences were found for substance use
(injection drug use, 3.1% AI vs. 1.3% white; alcohol use frequency,
2.01% AI vs. 2.5% white; binge drinking frequency, 1.25% AI vs. 1.53%
white). Among sexually active respondents, AIs were more likely to have
paid for sex (9%) than whites (3%). After adjustment, early sexual initiation
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.19­2.41), no con-
dom use at last sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval,
1.08­2.01), and AI race (adjusted odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval
1.46­4.11) were significantly associated with having an STI.
Conclusions: Individual-level sexual and other risk behaviors do not
fully explain disparities in STIs among AIs compared with white young
adults. Further examination of network and community factors is needed
to explain these disparities.
Research has documented significant racial disparities in sexu-
ally transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and
young adults in the United States.1,2 Although black-white dispar-
ities have received substantial attention, other racial/ethnic groups
are also at a heightened risk of STIs, relative to whites. American
Indian (AI) adolescents and young adults have one of the highest
rates of STIs of any racial/ethnic group in the United States.2­4
For instance, in 2010, AI adolescents had chlamydia and syphilis
rates roughly 3 times higher than those of whites and gonorrhea
rates approximately 3½ times higher.2 However, there exists a
paucity of studies that have examined why disparities in STIs exist
between AIs and whites.
Prior research examining racial disparities in STIs has often
focused on risky individual health behaviors and the black versus
white comparison. For instance, Hallfors and colleagues5 tested
whether risky sexual behaviors and substance use explained the
black-white disparity in STIs. The results showed that a number
of disparities existed between blacks and whites in risky sexual be-
haviors (and to a lesser extent, substance use behaviors), yet con-
trolling for these behaviors did not account for much of the race
gap in STIs.5 Nonetheless, a large body of research has demon-
strated that substance use and risky sexual behaviors heighten
STI risk,6­8 suggesting that these behaviors may help to explain
the high rates of STIs among certain racial minorities (such as
AIs), relative to whites.
Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that AIs are dispro-
portionately involved in risky sexual and substance use behaviors
compared with whites. Research suggests that urban AI adoles-
cents are more likely to be sexually active, have first intercourse
at younger ages, and are less likely to use condoms than their white
counterparts.9,10 Also, although some evidence11,12 suggests that
adult AIs are less likely to have used alcohol in their lifetimes, past
year, or past month, some studies suggest that adult AIs suffer
from much higher rates of binge drinking, substance abuse, and
substance dependence than whites.13,14 Finally, studies have found
that AI's illicit drug use exceeds that of other racial/ethnic groups
in the United States.10,13
Yet despite these disparities, we are aware of no studies that
have examined whether sexual and drug behavior patterns can ex-
plain the AI-white race gap in STIs. A recent study by De Ravello
and colleagues10 using 2 years of data from the national Youth
Risk Behavior Survey found higher levels of self-reported sub-
stance abuse and sexual risk behaviors among AI compared with
white high school students. However, because the Youth Risk Be-
havior Survey does not collect information about STI prevalence,
the association between these risk behaviors and STI status for
AI adolescents and young adults is not known. Our study objective
is to determine the association between sexual and substance use
behaviors with the likelihood of having an STI among AI com-
pared with white young adults after adjusting for confounding
characteristics.
METHODS
This study uses data from wave III of the National Longitu-
dinal Study of Adolescent Health, or the Add Health study.15
The Add Health is a nationally representative study of adolescents
attending 7th to 12th grades in 1994 when the study began. The
Add Health sample is representative of schools in the United
States with respect to region, urbanicity, school size, school sector,
and racial composition.16 The weighted response rate for wave III
was 75.6% (n = 14,322), with analysis of the nonrespondents sug-
gesting that this wave's sample was reflective of the original wave I
sample.17 Wave III data were collected in 2001 to 2002 when re-
spondents were 18 to 26 years old. All interviews were conducted

by interviewers using laptop computers, although answers to ques-
tions regarding sensitive behaviors (such as drug use and sexual
behavior) were entered by the respondent in privacy (using audio-
computer assisted self-interviewing methods).
At the end of the wave III interview, urine samples were
collected for tests of 3 STIs--chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and
gonorrhea--after consent for each test was given. Respondents
who consented received an incentive of $10 for providing the
specimen. Laboratory testing methods used for Add Health are
described elsewhere.18 Approximately 81% of the wave III partic-
ipants submitted a viable sample. Any respondent who had miss-
ing information for these tests, regardless of the reason, was
excluded from the present study. Furthermore, our study included
only those respondents who had complete information on all co-
variates of interest and who self-identified as primarily AI or white
(there was no Alaskan Native option).
Add Health respondents could choose multiple racial cate-
gories. Respondents were coded AI if they identified as only
"American Indian or Native American" or if they responded that
"American Indian or Native American" best described their racial
background. A similar approach was used to code white respon-
dents. In addition to race, we included other demographic vari-
ables including age, sex, and dichotomous indicators of marital
status, not having a high school degree, and public assistance
(based on whether the respondent had received temporary assis-
tance for needy families/welfare, food stamps, or a housing sub-
sidy, during the past year).
Substance use behaviors measured included injection drug
use since 1995 and frequency of marijuana use in the past month
up to 31 times or more. Alcohol use behaviors measured included
the frequency of alcohol use and binge drinking (i.e., drinking 5
drinks in a row) in the past year. Both were measured on a scale
from 0 (none) to 6 (everyday or almost everyday). A number of
measures of sexual behavior were included: early sexual initiation
(<15 years of age), condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse
(3 categories: condom use at last sex [referent category], did not
use condom at most recent sexual intercourse [no condom use
at last sex], and did not have sexual intercourse in past year [no
sex]), engaging in sex for money (paid for sex), number of sexual
partners in the past year, and sexual situation that respondent later
regretted because she/he had been drinking or used drugs (regret-
ted sex due to substance use).
Statistical Analysis
The outcome variable is STI, which is a dichotomous mea-
sure of whether the respondent tested positive for any of the 3 STIs
(i.e., chlamydia, trichomoniasis, or gonorrhea). We examined this
composite measure given the overall low percentage of positive in-
fections, coupled with the relatively small number of AI respon-
dents. American Indian and white participants were compared
with respect to demographic, substance use, and sexual risk behav-
iors using bivariate logistic regressions for categorical variables
(e.g., STI), ordinary least squares regression for continuous
variables (e.g., age), and negative binomial regression for count
variables (e.g., number of sexual partners). Subsequently, we com-
puted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the asso-
ciation between these variables and having an STI. All analyses
were conducted in Stata version 13 and weighted to account
for the complex survey design and the unequal probability of
selection.19
RESULTS
After limiting the sample to respondents with complete in-
formation on relevant variables, our final sample size was 367 AIs
and 7813 whites. Descriptive information about AI and white
participants is presented in Table 1. The results showed that the
percent of AI participants who tested positive for an STI at wave
III was 2.5 times greater than the percent of white participants
who tested positive, a statistically significant difference (9.0%
for AIs vs. 3.6% for whites). The results also demonstrated notable
differences with regard to substance use behaviors. The frequency
of binge drinking and the frequency of alcohol use were signifi-
cantly lower (P < 0.05) for AIs than for whites. However, AIs were
more likely to have injected drugs in the past year, relative to
whites. The observed difference in marijuana use frequency failed
to reach statistical significance. With regard to sexual behaviors,
AIs and whites only differed in terms of their likelihood to pay
for sex. Among those who had sex in the past year, AIs were sig-
nificantly more likely to have paid for sex (9.0% vs. 3.0%). None
of the other measures of sexual activity differed by racial group in
our sample.
Table 2 presents associations between demographic, sub-
stance use, and sexual behavior variables. Importantly, even when
controlling for substance use and sexual behaviors, race was a sig-
nificant predictor of having an STI. The odds of having an STI
were 2.4 times greater for AIs than for whites. Surprisingly, none
of the substance use behaviors were significant predictors of hav-
ing an STI. In contrast, a number of sexual behaviors emerged as
important predictors of having an STI. Early sexual initiation was
associated with a heightened risk of STI, controlling for all other
variables. Not using a condom at last sex also was associated with

a greater risk of STI, with the odds of having an STI 1.5 times
greater for this group than the referent group (i.e., condom use at
last sex).
We also computed a logistic regression model in which we
dropped those respondents who did not have sex in the past year
and reanalyzed the data. The results (available from the authors
on request) were quite similar to the findings presented in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
The key finding from our study was that the significant ra-
cial disparity in STIs persisted even when controlling for sub-
stance use and sexual behaviors. That is, the higher STI
prevalence among AIs compared with whites was not explained
by differential substance use or risky sexual behaviors between
the 2 groups. Our finding is consistent with prior research, exam-
ining whites and other racial groups, that such behaviors could not
account for racial disparities in STIs.5,20
Consistent with past studies, we found that a number of
risky sexual practices were predictive of increased STI risk. Not
using a condom at last sex and early sexual initiation were both as-
sociated with a higher likelihood of having an STI. However, even
when adjusting for these individual substance use and sexual be-
haviors, the racial disparity in STIs persisted. These results extend
prior work by highlighting that the differences in STIs among AI
and white adolescents and young adults are not due to differences
in substance use and risky sexual activity. Although we do not
know the reasons for the enduring AI-white gap in STIs, our re-
sults clearly suggest the need to look beyond sexual and substance
use behaviors. It may be that the documented STI disparity results
from racial differences in social environments (e.g., discrimina-
tion, place of residence, and neighborhood disadvantage)21,22
or differential access to treatment services between the groups.23
Furthermore, the gap may result from different sexual networks
between the 2 groups. Morris and colleagues24 have argued that
individual behaviors do not define one's STI risk. Instead "sexual
networks determine levels of individual exposure, the population
dynamics of infection spread, and the interactional contexts that
constrain behavioral changes" (p. 1029). Indeed, findings from a
number of studies have linked sexual network characteristics with
STI prevalence.25,26 These studies suggest that there is a compel-
ling need to conduct more research that examines sexual networks,
especially for exploring the AI-white race gap in STIs.
Importantly, our results should be interpreted in light of the
limitations of the current study. First, we only explored the associ-
ations with cross-sectional data. Hence, we have not examined the
possibility that early substance use or risky sexual behaviors led to
STIs before the wave in which our data were collected. Further-
more, we did not consider reciprocal relationships in these analy-
ses; it is possible, for instance, that people who discovered that
they had an STI before wave III might have reduced their engage-
ment in risky sexual behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex), potentially
serving to weaken the strength of the association between risky
sexual behaviors and STIs (measured at wave III). Ideally, a longi-
tudinal model that would include testing for STIs at each wave
would allow one to more precisely examine these relationships,
but our data did not include such testing. In addition, the sexual
and substance use measures were self-reported, and thus, some re-
sponse bias may be a concern. Furthermore, our measure of con-
dom use only captured the last sexual intercourse; hence, the
consistency in condom use during sexual activity is not being con-
sidered in our study. Also, the Add Health study did not ask infor-
mation about the tribal affiliation of the AI respondents, so we
cannot speak to any tribal variation in norms and customs relating
to sexual activity. Nor does our analysis consider evidence that
suggests that AI STI rates may vary greatly by region.27 Finally,
the Add Health study, like any study based on students in schools,
misses students who are truant or dropped out when the wave I
study was conducted, missing respondents who may be at a height-
ened risk for engaging in substance use and risky sexual behaviors.
Despite these limitations, the results from the current study
make an important contribution to the literature. The findings
demonstrate that AI young adults were much more likely to have
an STI (i.e., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis infection)
than white young adults. Because each of the tested STIs can
be treated, access to health care may be an important factor that
may serve to explain much of the race gap. Thus, focusing on
structural factors that may explain the AI-white gap in STIs will
be an important direction for future research. Factors such as per-
sistent poverty, limited access to health care, and high incarcera-
tion rates may all contribute to the AI-white gap in STIs. Indeed,
it may be time to reconsider the individual behavioral approach
to explaining race differences in STIs and implement models that
focus on networks and communities instead.
