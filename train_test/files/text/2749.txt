Individuals with higher educational attainment live healthier and
longer lives. However, not everyone benefits equally from higher
education. In particular, the black­white gap in life expectancy is
greater at higher levels of educational attainment. Furthermore,
recent research suggests that disadvantaged African Americans in
the rural Southeast who attend college have worse physical health
than their similarly disadvantaged peers who do not attend college.
The extent to which this pattern generalizes to a nationally repre-
sentative, mixed-race sample is unknown. Using data from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we test
whether the health benefits associated with college completion
vary by level of childhood disadvantage for depression and meta-
bolic syndrome in young adulthood, across race/ethnicity. We find
uniform lower depression associated with college completion re-
gardless of childhood disadvantage, and across non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic young adults. College completion
is associated with lower metabolic syndrome for whites across all
levels of childhood disadvantage. In contrast, college completion is
associated with higher metabolic syndrome among black and His-
panic young adults from disadvantaged childhood environments.
Our findings suggest that, for minorities from disadvantaged back-
grounds, finishing college pays substantial dividends for mental
health but simultaneously exacts costs with regard to physical
health. This pattern contrasts starkly with whites and minorities
from more privileged backgrounds, for whom college completion
is associated with benefits to both mental and physical health.
These results suggest that racial disparities in health may persist
in part because the health of upwardly mobile minorities is compro-
mised in young adulthood.
social mobility | health disparities | race and ethnic disparities |
young adulthood
Income and wealth inequality in the United States is high and has
been growing since the 1970s, with an increasing concentration
of fortunes in the top of the distribution (1­4). Upward inter-
generational income mobility has become less likely over this
period (5). While access to education has expanded, increasing
population levels of college attainment have been met with a si-
multaneous intensification of differentiation within categories of
educational attainment according to the quality of the educational
degree (6). Alongside the rise in income inequality, increases in
income segregation mean that the affluent are increasingly isolated
in affluent communities, concentrating high-quality public goods,
including schools, in restricted geographic locations (7). Income
segregation combined with racial segregation results in black and
Hispanic individuals living in more disadvantaged neighborhoods
and attending lower-quality schools than whites with the same
level of income and assets (8­10). Furthermore, there is evidence
that the returns to housing and educational investments are lower
for blacks and Hispanics than they are for whites (11, 12).
This context of inequality has been reflected in socioeconomic
gradients in health. The socioeconomic gradient in health and
mortality in the United States is large, persistent, and increasing
over time (13­16). While greater levels of socioeconomic re-
sources broadly defined are associated with better health, educa-
tion demonstrates the most consistently robust association (17).
More-educated individuals live healthier and longer lives; indi-
viduals with a college degree can expect to outlive their less-
educated counterparts by about a decade (18).
However, higher socioeconomic status (SES) is not equally
beneficial for all individuals; within SES categories, non-Hispanic
whites enjoy better health outcomes than non-Hispanic blacks,
and this gap is wider at higher levels of SES (19, 20). Weathering is
a conceptual framework that has been proposed to explain this
pattern (21). Minorities face greater exposure to stressors, in-
cluding discrimination and institutionalized racism, that requires
sustained coping (22­25). Another conceptual framework relevant
to these patterns is John Henryism, which suggests that individual
characteristics such as self-control, grit, and perseverance promote
psychosocial well-being and achievement but can be physiologi-
cally taxing because they result in sustained activation of the stress-
response system (26­28). This results in biological wear and tear,
accelerated aging, and accumulated risk, also referred to as allo-
static load (29, 30). Such stress-related deterioration is manifested
in physiological risk across biological systems (29). Alongside this
increasing emphasis on the importance of accumulated stressors
Significance
College graduates enjoy healthier, longer lives compared with
individuals who do not graduate from college. However, the
health benefit of educational attainment is not as great for
blacks as it is for whites. Moreover, college completion may not
erase the detrimental effects of early-life disadvantage for
blacks and Hispanics. We use nationally representative data on
young adults to test whether American minorities experience
differential returns to educational attainment. We find that
college completion predicts lower rates of depression for all
racial groups. It also predicts lower metabolic syndrome among
whites. However, college completion predicts higher metabolic
syndrome among black and Hispanic adults from disadvan-
taged backgrounds, suggesting upward mobility may come at
a health cost to young minorities in America.

has been the recognition of the role of early-life environments in
shaping adult health outcomes (31­33).
In a recent set of papers, Brody, Chen, Miller, and colleagues
investigate the health consequences of the intersection of high-
effort coping and early-life disadvantage among young adult Af-
rican Americans living in the rural Southeast. They document a
pattern of "skin-deep resilience" among African Americans from
severely disadvantaged backgrounds wherein those who evince
high levels of self-control prospectively demonstrate better school
outcomes and mental health than those with lower levels of self-
control, suggesting that they are psychologically resilient to dis-
advantage. However, these psychologically resilient individuals
simultaneously display signs of compromised physical health, in-
cluding higher allostatic load, greater cardiometabolic risk, more
epigenetic aging of leukocytes, and greater susceptibility to re-
spiratory infection (34­37).
These findings suggest that for African Americans from severely
disadvantaged backgrounds, upward mobility may have divergent
consequences for mental and physical health. However, the gener-
alizability of this phenomenon is unclear; most of the findings come
from small cohorts of African Americans in the rural Southeast, and
whether the same pattern unfolds with upward mobility in other
ethnic and racial groups across the United States is unknown. The
majority of existing research has concentrated on black­white dif-
ferences in health (20, 38, 39). However, the stress induced by
upward mobility is likely greater among any minority group for
whom systems of inequality constitute additional and compounding
barriers to achieving upward mobility. Indeed, the experience of
young adulthood and the process of becoming socially mobile vary
by race/ethnicity. Both African Americans and Hispanics are more
likely to be incarcerated, live in poverty, be unemployed, and have
lower incomes for a given level of education compared with whites
(40­42). Differences in the life course markers and transitions
among minority young adults not only affect their prospects for
becoming upwardly mobile but also affect the amount of distress
and sustained effort required to achieve upward mobility. These
differences have important implications for the experience and
potential health consequences of mobility for minorities.
We consider that possibility here, using a large, nationally rep-
resentative study with longitudinal data spanning 14 y that include
young adults from all race, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic
contexts in America. Drawing from the literatures on weathering,
John Henryism, and skin-deep resilience, we predicted there would
be racial and ethnic disparities in the mental and physical health
benefits associated with a college degree. We used self-reported
depressive symptoms as a measure of mental health, as it is a
mental health problem that increases during adolescence and re-
mains prevalent for young adults (43­46). Morbidity and mortality
are unusual in 24- to 32-y-olds, so we measured physical health in
terms of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of signs that is common in
midlife and forecasts risk for later diabetes, heart attack, stroke,
and premature mortality (47, 48). Among whites from all socio-
economic backgrounds, we hypothesized that finishing college
would be associated with uniformly positive returns in adulthood,
as reflected in fewer depressive symptoms and better car-
diometabolic health at ages 24­32 y. However, among ethnic and
racial minorities, we hypothesized there would be mixed returns to
finishing college, particularly for those from the most severely
disadvantaged backgrounds, who are likely to face racism, dis-
crimination, and isolation as they progress through education.
Specifically, we predicted these individuals will go on to have better
mental health, as reflected in fewer depressive symptoms at ages
24­32 y, but simultaneously worse cardiometabolic health.
Results
The data were drawn from the nationally representative National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health),
an ongoing study of the social, behavioral, and biological linkages
in health and developmental trajectories. Our analysis examined
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic young
adults interviewed in adolescence (wave I, age 12­18 y) and early
adulthood (wave IV, age 24­32 y). From these data we generated
a composite indicator of exposure to disadvantage in adolescence
by summing the number of top quintile values across household,
neighborhood, and school contexts (see details in Materials and
Methods). Table 1 shows that black and Hispanic individuals ex-
perienced significantly higher levels of disadvantage in adoles-
cence compared with white peers. By early adulthood, both race/
ethnic minorities were also significantly less likely to complete a
college degree than whites.
We measured adult depressive symptoms at wave IV using a
subset of nine items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression scale (CES-D) (see details in Materials and Methods).
Whites reported the fewest depressive symptoms on average
(4.55), followed by Hispanics (5.65) and blacks (6.07). The mea-
surements were collected in home visits during wave IV. We
constructed an indicator of metabolic syndrome, modifying slightly
the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines to ac-
commodate the available Add Health biomarkers. We used
measures of blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, HDL cho-
lesterol, triglycerides, and waist circumference (see details in
Materials and Methods). Similar to the pattern observed for de-
pression, and consistent with the broader epidemiologic literature,
whites were the least likely to have metabolic syndrome (26%)
compared with Hispanics (32%) and blacks (35%).
We tested for psychosocial resilience using Poisson regression
for the count of the number of depressive symptoms reported with
models stratified by race/ethnicity (Table S2). In all models, sex
and age were modeled as covariates. Individuals from disadvan-
taged childhood backgrounds reported more depressive symptoms
in adulthood, and those who completed a college degree reported
fewer depressive symptoms. To test whether the association be-
tween college education and depression varies by level of ado-
lescent disadvantage we included an interaction term. There was
no evidence that the depression-buffering association of college
completion varies by exposure to disadvantage in adolescence for
whites (P = 0.32) or Hispanics (P = 0.24). Furthermore, among
black young adults, a college degree was associated with even

fewer depressive symptoms for individuals from increasingly dis-
advantaged childhood backgrounds (P < 0.05). Controlling for
baseline depressive symptoms in adolescence does not sub-
stantively alter the conclusion. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the results
were consistent with the hypothesis that greater educational at-
tainment is associated with psychosocial benefits for individuals
from all socioeconomic backgrounds and of varying race/ethnicity.
We tested the differential benefits of college completion for
physical health using logistic regression to predict the odds of
having metabolic syndrome with models stratified by race/ethnicity
(Table S3). In all models, sex and age were modeled as covariates.
Among white young adults, each SD increase in adolescent dis-
advantage was associated with a 10% increase in the odds of
metabolic syndrome (P < 0.05). College completion was associ-
ated with a 37% decrease in the odds of metabolic syndrome (P <
0.001). There was no evidence that this health-protective associ-
ation of college completion varied by level of adolescent disad-
vantage (P = 0.33). Results are substantively similar when
controlling for measures of physical health in adolescence.
As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the results were different for black
and Hispanic adults compared with whites. At low levels of ex-
posure to adolescent disadvantage college completion predicted a
lower probability of metabolic syndrome compared with those
without a college degree. However, as exposure to adolescent
disadvantage increased, the health benefit associated with college
completion declined. In fact, at high levels of disadvantage (>1 SD
above mean), black and Hispanic adults with a college degree
were predicted to be more likely to have metabolic syndrome
compared with their similarly disadvantaged peers who did not
complete college. For example, a black adult exposed to an ado-
lescent environment of disadvantage two SDs above the mean who
completed college had a predicted probability of metabolic syn-
drome 9% points higher than a peer who did not complete college
(0.43 compared with 0.34).
Follow-up analyses verified that the physical health benefit
associated with college completion was significantly different for
Hispanic and black adults compared with whites (Table S4).
Specifically, we tested for race/ethnic differences in a single lo-
gistic regression model pooling the three groups and including
additional indicators for black/Hispanic identity interacted with
adolescent disadvantage and college degree (i.e., a three-way
interaction). The main effect of college degree indicated that
college completion is associated with lower odds of metabolic
syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, P < 0.001]. The interaction
between adolescent disadvantage and college completion--rele-
vant for the reference group of whites--was not statistically sig-
nificant (P = 0.54). However, the three-way interaction between
adolescent disadvantage, college completion, and black/Hispanic
identity was positive (OR = 1.44) and marginally significant (P <
0.10). These findings indicate that for black and Hispanic adults the
metabolic "benefit" associated with college completion diminishes--
and indeed appears to become a liability--with increasing levels
of exposure to adolescent disadvantage.
Discussion
Upward social mobility is a tenet of the American dream. Scholars
and policymakers interested in health and inequality would hope
that greater social and economic advantage attained in adulthood
would improve health outcomes compared with remaining disad-
vantaged. Indeed, many social policies are premised on the belief
that by promoting socioeconomic success among the disadvan-
taged we can improve their well-being and physical health, cre-
ating a healthier and more productive population. Consistent with
these aspirations, we found that young adults from disadvantaged
backgrounds who achieve upward mobility by attaining a college
degree report fewer depressive symptoms compared with their
similarly disadvantaged peers who do not complete college. This
relationship holds for non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
In contrast, for metabolic syndrome we found that individuals do
not uniformly benefit from a college degree; black and Hispanic
adults from the most disadvantaged backgrounds face higher
levels of metabolic syndrome with a college degree than those
without a college degree. While whites from across the socioeco-
nomic spectrum enjoy a physical health benefit associated with
college completion, blacks and Hispanics from disadvantaged
backgrounds see no benefit and at higher levels of disadvantage
may actually experience a cost. If this relationship persists through
adulthood and older age it has the potential to undermine the
individual and social benefits of upward mobility.
This is the first evidence documenting the psychological benefit
and physiological deficit of college completion in both disadvan-
taged African American and Hispanic American young adults in a
nationally representative sample. Our findings are consistent with
a pattern of skin-deep resilience among upwardly mobile

vantage and college completion. The association between college completion and depression does not vary according to level of exposure to disadvantage in
adolescence for whites (P = 0.32) and Hispanics (P = 0.24) and increases with disadvantage for blacks (P < 0.05).

minorities from severely disadvantaged backgrounds (35, 37).
What might underlie these patterns? We speculate that these
upwardly mobile minority youth are psychologically hardy.
However, when young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds
achieve upward mobility the higher-status environment in which
they find themselves may differ greatly from their social envi-
ronment of origin (49, 50); such incongruence can lead to iso-
lation and a lack of social support (20, 51­53). Furthermore,
conditions in the environment of arrival may be inhospitable or
hostile, particularly given discriminatory social structures. Up-
wardly mobile minorities may also feel that their achieved posi-
tion is tenuous (54, 55). To cope with these stressors, individuals
may deploy strategies that are effective in alleviating mental strife
but are harmful for physical health (51, 56). Despite such chal-
lenges, these young adults complete their degrees and maintain
good mental health. As they do so, however, a wear and tear on
bodily systems from hard-driving effort may accrue.
In supplementary analyses of metabolic syndrome (Table S5)
we tested the mediating role of four potential mechanisms: indi-
vidual psychosocial characteristics of striving in adolescence
and perseverance in adulthood, social isolation in adolescence and
adulthood, experience of stressful life events in adolescence and
adulthood and perceived social stress in adulthood, and adoles-
cent body mass index. Accounting for differences in individual
levels of striving and exposure to social stressors does not explain
the elevated health risk observed among disadvantaged minority
college graduates. Future research must consider both more nu-
anced measures of the social context in which upward mobility
occurs as well as more complicated intersections of stress exposure
and response.
The absence of a physical health benefit to college completion
for young adult minorities suggests important implications for the
labor force, health care, and the future of inequality. If they do not
experience the expected health benefits of educational attainment,
upwardly mobile minorities may spend less time in the labor force,
limiting their resource accumulation and the intergenerational
transfer of wealth, consequently stunting potential for reducing
inequality within and across generations. Furthermore, accelera-
ted physiological deterioration may mean that they will need more
health care at earlier adult ages. Greater health-care costs could
divert investment from future human capital development in
themselves and their children. Finally, given the persistence of
inequality and the difficulty of mobility in the United States, it is
troubling if the individuals who manage to achieve upward mo-
bility experience health costs. Perhaps more troubling still is that
this pattern is limited to black and Hispanic individuals, poten-
tially making it more challenging to close existing racial disparities
in health.
However, it would be erroneous to conclude from our findings
that upward mobility is bad for your health and should therefore
be avoided. Rather, policies are needed that promote upward
mobility, making it more common and less stressful, and sup-
porting the upwardly mobile individual's ability to translate his or
her additional education into health-promoting resources. This
should include increased attention to educational quality in ad-
dition to access. Recent publicity of the challenges faced by first-
generation college students provides an opportunity to examine
how supportive interventions affect not only completion, but
mental and physical health. Online communities, such as I'm First!,
provide student testimonials and information to support first-
generation students in accessing and completing college. Many
colleges and universities are beginning to offer programs tailored
to the needs of first-generation students, such as the Harvard
College First Generation Student Union. Such programs may in-
crease feelings of belonging and reduce stress; for example, a
social-belonging intervention not only reduced the achievement
gap but also demonstrated physical health improvements among
minority students (57). Design and evaluation of other interven-
tions, with specific attention to the potential physical health risks
of college completion among disadvantaged minorities, is a fruitful
area for future research.
Future research can also address a limitation of this study by
following individuals across the life course to better understand
how elevated health risk at this age shapes health and aging tra-
jectories among the upwardly mobile. We examined a composite
measure of metabolic syndrome in early adulthood, when re-
spondents were aged 24­32 y. The use of biomarker measure-
ments allows us to investigate risk before disease onset when many
conditions are asymptomatic or undetected via traditional clinical
screening. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether such risk will
ultimately manifest in morbidities, or if upwardly mobile individ-
uals will be able to translate their accumulating advantage into
better health as they age. Documenting the health consequences
associated with social mobility in early adulthood provides a

vantage and college completion. The association between college completion and metabolic syndrome does not vary according to level of exposure to
disadvantage in adolescence for whites (P = 0.33) but increases with disadvantage for blacks (P < 0.01) and Hispanics (P < 0.01). There is evidence that the
physical health benefits of education in early adulthood vary by level of exposure to disadvantage earlier in life only for black and Hispanic adults.

foundation from which to understand different aging trajectories
for those from disadvantaged backgrounds that begin during the
transition to adulthood. In addition, the elevated health risk asso-
ciated with upward mobility for disadvantaged minority young adults
may partially explain the persistent racial disparity in health across
place and time among older adults at the same level of SES (58).
Materials and Methods
Sample and Design. Add Health is an ongoing national longitudinal study
representative of American adolescents in grades 7­12 in 1994­1995. The
initial sample included 20,745 adolescents aged 12­20 y; since the start of
the study, participants have been interviewed in home at four data collec-
tion waves. At wave IV in 2008­2009, respondents were aged 24­32 y (n =
15,701, 80.3% response rate) and asked to participate in biological specimen
collection (over 95% provided specimens, almost 15,000).
We limited our analytic sample to respondents who participated in both
waves I and IV in-home interviews, were from schools that participated in the in-
school and school administrator surveys, and had valid sampling weights (n =
14,167). From this sample, we conducted listwise deletion to exclude those
without complete data for all predictors and demographic covariates used in
the analysis, leaving us with a final sample size of n = 13,009 for the depressive
symptoms analysis. An additional 20% of respondents had missing data for at
least one biological indicator of metabolic syndrome, yielding a sample size of
n = 10,786 for the metabolic syndrome analysis. All data were analyzed with
institutional review board approval from the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. Information on how to obtain the Add Health data files is
available on the Add Health website (www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth).
Race/Ethnicity. At wave I, individuals were asked, "What is your race?" and
instructed to indicate as many categories as applied. They were also asked a
separate question, "Are you of Hispanic or Spanish origin?" We classified
any individual who indicated yes as Hispanic. We classified individuals as
non-Hispanic white if they did not identify as Hispanic and reported their
race as white only. We classified individuals as non-Hispanic black if they did
not identify as Hispanic and reported their race as black only; 135 individuals
identified as both white and black, and were excluded from analysis, and
370 foreign-born individuals were also excluded from analysis.
Adolescent Disadvantage. To measure childhood disadvantage, we constructed
a count of 22 binary indicators that capture cumulative exposure to household,
school, and neighborhood disadvantage over childhood and/or during ado-
lescence (wave I; Table S1). Household disadvantage indicators include a binary
indicator of single-parent family structure at birth, experience of any family
structure change across childhood and adolescence, parent education less than
high school, and a retrospective measure of household welfare receipt during
childhood or adolescence. Neighborhood disadvantage indicators were taken
from the 1990 US Census to best approximate neighborhood conditions during
wave I of the Add Health study. Neighborhood disadvantage measures include
the tract-level proportion of households receiving welfare, proportion of un-
employed adults, proportion of households below poverty line, proportion of
adults with less than a high school education, proportion female-headed
households, proportion black residents, proportion vacant homes, and the
county-level infant mortality rate and violent crime rate. Each item was reco-
ded so those residing in neighborhoods at the top quartile of the distribution
were coded as disadvantaged. Finally, indicators of school disadvantage at
wave I included school-level aggregated measures of the proportion of
households receiving welfare, the proportion of unemployed parents, the
proportion of parents with less than a high school education, and the pro-
portion of single-parent households. All items were recoded as binary indica-
tors, with the top quartile coded as disadvantaged. School disadvantage was
also captured using wave I school administrator reports of grade retention, the
school dropout rate, class sizes, the proportion of teachers with a master's
degree, and daily school attendance. Consistent with other items in the index,
school administrator items were recoded as binary indicators, with the top
quartile of grade retention, dropout rate, and class size coded as disad-
vantaged and the bottom quartile of teachers with a master's degree and
daily school attendance coded as disadvantaged. We summed all of the in-
dicators to create a score ranging from 0 to 22. We standardized the score,
so that the coefficients associated with the disadvantage index can be
interpreted as the change in health risk associated with a one-SD increase
in disadvantage.
Depression. At wave IV, respondents were asked how often they "were both-
ered by things that usually don't bother you," "could not shake off the blues,"
"felt you were as good as other people," "had trouble keeping your mind on
what you were doing," "felt depressed," "felt that you were too tired to do
things," "enjoyed life," "felt sad," and "felt that people disliked you" over the
past 7 d. Response categories ranged from 0 to 3 and included "never or rarely,"
"sometimes," "a lot of the time," and "most of the time or all of the time."
Items were summed to produce a continuous scale with a possible range of 0­27.
Metabolic Syndrome. For each biomarker measured at wave IV we defined the
high-risk threshold according to the guidelines established by the National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel when possible. High-risk
blood pressure was defined as measured blood pressure greater than 130/
85 mmHg, or self-report of doctor-diagnosed hypertension or antihyper-
tensive medication. A measured waist circumference of 88 cm or greater for
women and 102 cm or greater for men was defined as high risk.
NCEP guidelines specify cut points of HDL and triglycerides for risk thresh-
olds; however, Add Health only releases lipid measurements in deciles due to
detrending and interconversion procedures (59). As an alternative classifica-
tion, we relied on previous estimates from the same time period on the
prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in similarly aged males and
females (60). This approach has been used previously to create a modified
measure of metabolic syndrome in Add Health (61). The top three deciles of
triglycerides were defined as high-risk for males, and the top two for females.
The bottom two deciles of HDL were defined as high-risk for males, and the
bottom three for females. Finally, the NCEP guidelines use fasting blood glu-
cose; due to differences in fasting time, we used glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
as a measure of glycemic homeostasis. HbA1c levels at 5.7% or greater were
defined as high-risk (62). Metabolic syndrome is an indicator, defined as hav-
ing high risk levels on three or more of the component risk factors. Detailed
Add Health data collection procedures and biomarker validation are available
elsewhere (63­65).
Mediators. We tested the mediating role of four sets of potential mechanisms.
Striving was measured in adolescence (wave I) using a four-item scale drawing
from educational expectations, educational aspirations, hopefulness about the
future, and belief in hard work. We measured perseverance in adulthood (wave
IV) using nine personality items such as optimism, planning for the future, and
sense of control over one's life. We tested the role of social isolation using
scales of social isolation in adolescence (lack of social connections with family,
friends, and schoolmates and in the community) and adulthood (lack of social
connections with family, friends, community, and other social institutions).
Social stress was measured using a count of the number of stressful life events
reported in adolescence and adulthood, and the Cohen perceived stress scale
measured at wave IV. Finally, we investigated the role of obesity using a
measure of adolescent body mass index derived from adolescent report of
height and weight at wave I.
