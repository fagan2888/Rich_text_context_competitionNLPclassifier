Platforms and hyper-choice on the World
Wide Web
Timothy Graham
Abstract
Choice is a sine qua non of contemporary life. From childhood until death, we are faced with an unending series of
choices through which we cultivate a sense of self, govern conduct, and shape the future. Nowadays, individuals increas-
ingly experience and enact consumer choice online through web-based platforms such as Yelp.com, TripAdvisor.com and
Amazon.com. These platforms not only provide a sprawling array of goods and services to choose from, but also reviews,
ratings and ranking devices and systems of classification to navigate this landscape of choice. This paper suggests a radical
reconsideration of platform architectures and design features to consider how they reconfigure and respecify choice,
`choosers', and choice-making practices. Platforms are not simply cameras that present choice and enable comparisons
between different options, but are more akin to engines that govern, drive and expand choice, configuring users within
particular discourses, practices and subjectivities. In making sense of the entangled trajectories of consumer choice,
platform architectures and Big Data, I suggest that `hyper-choice' emerges as a condition of the contemporary platform-
driven web. I examine hyper-choice not only in terms of the relationship between platforms and a growing abundance of
choice, but more importantly how platforms reconfigure choice in ways that go beyond and fundamentally challenge
existing understandings of what choice is, who and what is involved in producing knowledge about choice, and what it
means to be a `chooser'.

Introduction
In contemporary consumer societies, individuals experi-
ence more choice than ever before. From childhood
until death, we face a `wide-ranging and unending
series of choices' across almost every domain of life
(Clarke, 2010: 58). We choose which food to eat,
what clothes to wear, our style of haircut, what types
of insurance to purchase (or not), the level and types of
consumption practices that we undertake, and so on.
Choice, that is, the options that individuals have at
their disposal as well as the ability to compare between
them and make a decision, has been argued to be fun-
damental to individual freedom, autonomy and well-
being (Leotti et al., 2010), and the development of
Western society (Rosenthal, 2005). Although choice is
a phenomenon that is unequally distributed throughout
consumer societies (discussed later in section), at the
same time it enables people to cultivate an individual
sense of self and exercise the right to direct their own
lives and practices of consumption. As Iyengar sug-
gests, there is a feedback loop between self-identity
and choice: `If I am this, then I should choose that; if
I choose that, then I must be this' (2011: 109). It would
appear that choice is a universal good, that is, more
choice is better. However, choice is both complex and
problematic.
A challenge concerning choice is that consumer
societies have an over-abundance of it (Clarke, 2010;
Iyengar, 2011). For example, counting the products in
his local supermarket, Schwartz (2005) observed that
there were 275 varieties of cereal, 230 types of soup,

Whilst too little choice can be detrimental, too much
choice threatens to overwhelm individuals and under-
mine the benefits that choice can provide. In this way,
choice has been critically examined as a paradox
(Schwartz, 2005), an explosion (Iyengar, 2011), a tyr-
anny (Salecl, 2011), and even a myth (Greenfield, 2011).
Elsewhere the notion of `hyper-choice' has been devel-
oped to describe an objective condition of consumer
societies whereby an `ever-increasing amount of
buying occurs amidst an ever-increasing amount of
new products, brands, and brand extensions' (Mick
et al., 2004: 207). Similarly, Larceneux et al. (2007)
construe hyper-choice as a situated phenomenon
whereby individuals are faced with too many or too
varied options, which in turn overwhelms their capacity
to make choices. Choice is thus positioned as `hyper' in
terms of the scale and speed at which it is expanding
and differentiating.
Yet individuals are not passive in contemporary
choice-infused environments. They actively draw on a
range of tools, knowledge and heuristics in order to
help them navigate choice and make `informed' deci-
sions. Nowadays, one of the most important and per-
vasive tools is the Internet and, more specifically, the
web. The advent of what is popularly referred to as
`Web 2.0' has opened up a world of choice (Han,
2011) and choice-making functionalities through a pro-
liferation of consumer and e-commerce websites. For
example, popular e-commerce websites such as
Amazon.com and eBay.com position users as co-
producers of sprawling online market places (e.g.,
reading and writing reviews, providing ratings,
making purchases). `Comparison shopping websites'
provide tools for users to compare prices between sell-
ers (e.g., Shopbot.com, BizRate.com). Similarly,
`reviews websites' (e.g., TripAdvisor.com, Yelp.com)
and `ratings websites' (e.g., RateMyTeachers.com,
DoctorScoreCard.com) provide users with information
to compare businesses and professionals.
In exploring this topic, Graham (2016) undertook a
foundational study of how choice is shaped online
through the design features and architecture of web-
sites. Graham argues that the aforementioned kinds
of sites neither determine choice nor simply provide a
neutral space for the liberal ideal of `free choice' to play
out, but instead constitute and structure the experience
of having and making choice. Such websites thus obtain
a `logic of choice' (in some ways akin to Ziewitz's
(2012) `logic of evaluation'). Moreover, the empirical
analysis of websites undertaken by Graham (2016)
revealed an interesting type or sub-species of choice-
infused websites, that is, large-scale platforms that go
beyond the baseline or `normal' understanding and
experience of choice. Graham argues that the design
features and architecture of platforms such as
Amazon significantly expand the scope, scale and
speed of choice-making, blur the line between users
and content producers (Bruns and Schmidt, 2011),
and embody a form of empiricism that radically chal-
lenges how we come to know and differentiate choice.
Indeed, the author alludes to the `hyper' nature of these
kinds of choice-infused platforms, although this idea is
not pursued further (see Graham, 2016, abstract).
These kinds of platforms provide an interesting ana-
lytical focal point for further investigation. In what
ways do their design features and architecture appear
to drive, expand, speed up, and reconfigure choice in a
`hyper' way? However, more than simply energising or
exciting the choice-making process, I seek to attend to
how platforms appear to `go beyond' and `overshoot'
or `overstep' our normal understanding of what choice
is and how it is constituted, drawing on the lexical def-
inition of the prefix `hyper' and its Greek roots (Oxford
English Dictionary, 2017). Hence, our focus is not
simply on hyper-choice as the relationship between
platforms and a growing abundance or glut of choice,
but more importantly on how platforms reconfigure
choice in interesting and profound ways that reimagine,
re-specify and challenge our foundational understand-
ings of what choice is, who and what is involved in
producing knowledge about choice, and what it
means to be a `chooser'.
To be sure, choice is not a universally available phe-
nomenon. Not everyone experiences choice in the same
way ­ it is differentially constructed and experienced
(Ben-Porath, 2010; Sen, 1977, 1999), and is not equally
distributed throughout the population. Differences in
individuals' social realities have a significant impact
not only on the choices they have on offer, but also
their ability to choose between them. Choice is differ-
ential, just as opportunity is not uniform. Despite
claims that the Internet produces uniform benefits
and opportunities for economic growth, differing
degrees of Internet connectivity result in uneven eco-
nomic impacts across geographies and social strata
(Friederici et al., 2017). These geographical inequalities
of Internet access are also concomitant with differences
in the modes of participation available to users in dif-
ferent geographical contexts. Indeed, peoples' experi-
ence of choice on the web would be markedly
different in countries where Internet access is filtered
or controlled by the state. Thus the expansion of
choice I have elaborated so far in this paper is not
experienced universally. In light of these consider-
ations, the focus of this paper is on particular forms
and experiences of choice in the context of large-scale,
commercial web platforms. In this paper I focus on,
2 Big Data & Society
and critically examine, practices of choice and con-
sumption in privileged Western countries predomin-
antly in North America and Western Europe, and
countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
Having made some important clarifications about
the types and experiences of choice I invoke in this
study, the remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. In the next section, I examine how platforms
leverage user-generated Big Data and ratings and rank-
ings devices to undertake a politics of commensuration
that fundamentally reconfigures knowledge production
about choice. Drawing on theories in the sociology of
classification and standards and science and technology
studies (STS), I argue that this novel form of empiri-
cism radically challenges, and perhaps even nullifies,
existing categories and standards that used to define
choice. In `Choice and the politics of commensuration
within produsage-driven platforms' section I use illus-
trative case examples of popular choice-infused plat-
forms (Graham, 2016) to discuss how their design
features and architecture shape choice in a way that
breaks down, hybridises, and challenges the longstand-
ing conceptual dualisms that we use to understand con-
sumer choice and web use, such as producers versus
consumers, and users versus producers. In the final sec-
tion I examine how the individuality, self-governing
capacities and subjectivity of users is actively harnessed
and attempted to be shaped by platforms. Drawing on
Foucauldian governmentality and key theories in STS
and the philosophy of technology, I argue that plat-
forms, through their architecture and design features,
imbue a productive mode of power that seeks to pro-
duce and reproduce particular kinds of consumerist and
neoliberal subjectivities pertinent to the goals and ima-
ginaries of the platform operators.
Taken together, I argue that these factors point
towards a condition of hyper-choice as one possible tra-
jectory and emergent feature of contemporary choice-
infused platforms such as TripAdvisor.com and
Yelp.com. The concept of hyper-choice developed in
this paper opens up new opportunities and research dir-
ections to appraise and critically evaluate the way in
which platforms organise and reconfigure human experi-
ence through a logic of choice. In exploring this import-
ant ­ and scarcely studied ­ phenomenon, the paper
invites readers to go beyond what it means to experience
and enact choice in an era of Big Data and platforms.
Choice and commensurability on
platforms: The reconfiguration of
choice and choice-making practices
A key aspect of choice on the web concerns the prac-
tices of `choosing', that is, the ability for users to
compare between heterogeneous goods and/or services
in particular ways, in order to evaluate their merits and
properties against a common standard or metric. For
example, when choosing somewhere to eat, a user on
Yelp.com might compare between a French restaurant
versus a Chinese restaurant, trading off between five-
star user ratings versus affordability and location. The
longstanding notion of commensurability (cf. Kuhn,
1982) is key to understanding how practices of choosing
are made not only made practicable but also reconfi-
gured via the design of web spaces. Comparing two
dissimilar items (e.g., an orange and an apple) is pos-
sible providing we have a common nomenclature or
standard ­ or technology ­ to compare them by. Thus
ratings, rankings and sorting devices become enrolled
in different ways to make commensurability (and thus
choice) possible through the web.
Yet choice is also about knowledge. How can we
know which option is a better choice amongst various
alternatives? Ziewitz positions this in terms of a `politics
of commensuration' that frames commensuration as a
social process enacted through practical facilities
of classification and sorting (2012: 54­56).
Commensuration is `the process of transforming dis-
parate forms of value into homogeneous units, which
allows information reduction, uncertainty absorption,
and simplification of decision-making' (Scott and
Orlikowski, 2012: 115). In reasoning about these
`forms of value' and `units', platforms such as
TripAdvisor construct choice by classifying things in
particular ways. Recent scholarship has examined the
role of commensurability through a case study of
TripAdvisor, which enables users to find and compare
between accommodation and travel options (Scott and
Orlikowski, 2012). They argue that user-generated rat-
ings and reviews on Trip Advisor have reconfigured the
hotel industry because these technologies enable com-
parisons between accommodation options that are
regarded as categorically different and incommensur-
able in the travel industry. The authors use the example
of the ManorHouse (a hotel) and the PubInn (a pub),
which are not seen as direct competitors in the industry
because they are in different classes of accommodation,
and are listed in entirely separate industry guidebooks.
Yet, they argue that the review and rating system on
Trip Advisor renders these options commensurable and
in doing so `[intensifies] this material nullification of
industry standards' (Scott and Orlikowski, 2012: 121).
Processes of sorting and commensuration on plat-
forms have important consequences for the categories
we use to define and navigate choice. Moreover, classi-
fication and categories are central to understanding how
knowledge is produced about choice (as in the options
on offer). To clarify what is meant by classification I
Graham 3
draw on the foundational definition provided by
Bowker and Star:
A classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal
segmentation of the world. A `classification system' is a
set of boxes (metaphorical or literal) into which things
can be put to then do some kind of work ­ bureaucratic
or knowledge production. (Bowker and Star, 1996: 10,
emphasis original)
The way in which categories order social processes is
important to how choice is constructed and facilitated
through platforms such as TripAdvisor. Ranking and
rating devices have become a sort of `information infra-
structure' (Bowker et al., 2010) providing practical
facilities to categorise the world, effectively becoming
standardised tools that constitute `recipes for reality'
(Busch, 2011). Choice-making practices and modes of
knowledge production in platform environments are
remarkably different than in traditional settings. For
instance, Blank's (2007) two-fold framework of reviews
systems consists of `connoisseurial' reviews by singular
experts, and `procedural' reviews produced through
tests and standardised procedures, which usefully con-
ceptualise traditional choice-making practices but do
not attend to the radically different form of empiricism
we observe in the context of large-scale platforms. Yet
construing these kinds of devices and functionalities as
simply making everything commensurable and produ-
cing difference fails to consider a more important point:
platform ratings and reviews systems are reconfiguring
existing standards, driven (at least in part) by the need
to organise and facilitate choice in consumer societies
that have an overabundance of it.
As discussed previously, Scott and Orlikowski (2012)
argue that the platform infrastructure of TripAdvisor
intensifies a nullification of existing industry standards.
In this way, existing categories that are context-specific,
such as classes of accommodation in the travel industry
(e.g., pubs versus hotels) do not come to define and
structure choice in the way they used to. Ratings,
reviews and rankings devices (as infrastructure for
choice on platforms) reinvent, reimagine, and perhaps
even in the case of TripAdvisor collapse, existing cate-
gories and systems of classification that we use to define
choice. To be sure, standardisation differentiation and
categorisation systems for choice are not new phenom-
ena. For example, Busch highlights how the Sears
Roebuck catalogue, issued in 1894, `massively increased
consumers' choices' by using standardised categories
and characteristics of commensurability to differentiate
over 200,000 items (2011: 153). However, in the context
of digital platforms we observe that established stand-
ards for commensuration and categories that define and
order choice are radically reconfigured. The politics of
commensuration engendered through platforms `goes
beyond', `overshoots', and respecifies how consumer
choice is normally or traditionally constructed and
framed. This is one of the `hyper' aspects of choice in
the context of large-scale consumer platforms such as
TripAdvisor.
Yet as Graham (2016, Chapter 4) demonstrates,
there is a constellation of devices, including but not
limited to ratings and reviews, that websites deploy in
order to engender a politics of commensuration within
the web space. For instance, platforms such as
Amazon.com enable options on offer to be rendered
commensurable according to how many other users
have viewed or purchased them (i.e., number of page
hits and number of purchases). This provides the ability
to rapidly sort options by how popular they are with
other users (see Figure 1), even in the absence of other
information such as product ratings. Such devices differ
to rating devices insofar as an option might be popular
(i.e., many people are viewing it) or bestselling (i.e.,
many people are purchasing it) regardless of how
highly it is rated. For example, at the time of writing,
the book `Allegiant' by Veronica Roth was ranked 4th
on the Kindle best-seller list on Amazon.com, despite
only receiving an average of three stars out of five (after
8,241 reviews). Ostensibly at least, platforms are able to
leverage and triangulate massive stores of user-
generated data (purchases, product views, clickstreams)
to not only respecify and reimagine previously existing
categories that used to define choice, but also increas-
ingly speed up the choice-making process and make it
easier for users. For instance, if a user can't find a
rating for a particular product or service they wish to
compare, then they might be able to sort the options on
offer by popularity; or if there is not enough data to
rank the options by popularity, they can look at the
sorted list of bestsellers; and so on. Crucially, what
these kinds of algorithmic devices and functionalities

(Walmart.com).

depend upon a sufficiently large amount of user-
generated data to render them practical. If there is
only a small user population to derive data-driven pat-
terns from and a small number of options to compare
between, their usefulness and practicality arguably
diminishes.
Thus another hyper aspect of choice on platforms is
how user-generated Big Data and economies of scale
are leveraged not only to facilitate choice under condi-
tions of abundance, but moreover to speed up choice-
making practices and expand the scope and scale of
choice. We observe that there is a rapid feedback
loop between users and platforms, and moreover that
this relationship is recursive: as more users are attracted
to the platform (interpreted here as visiting the plat-
form in order to make choices quickly and easily),
more data becomes available to enhance the choice-
making functionality, which results in more users
visiting and revisiting. However, whilst the arguments
presented in this section form part of the picture of
what is different ­ I suggest hyper ­ about choice in a
platform context, it does not attend to the way in which
platforms not only depend upon but actively target and
subjectify users in ways that go beyond and greatly
overstep conventional choice-making practices and
subject/object dichotomies. It is to these issues that
we now turn.
Choice and the politics of
commensuration within
produsage-driven platforms
Using a range of illustrative examples in the previous
section I have shown how platforms configure choice
through a complex entanglement of user-generated Big
Data, architectures that deploy ratings, rankings and
sorting devices, and a politics of commensuration that
involves classification practices and knowledge produc-
tion via categories. In this way, the design features and
architecture of platforms such as eBay.com are a kind
of `invisible engine' that choice runs on, facilitating and
structuring how transactions and economic interactions
between different actors take place (Evans et al., 2006:
349­355). Platform operators and users alike have intri-
cately interconnected, often asymmetric, relationships
and interests in this arrangement. Indeed, Gillespie
calls to attention the `politics' of platforms, highlighting
the `tensions inherent in their service: between user-gen-
erated and commercially-produced content, between
cultivating community and serving up advertising,
between intervening in the delivery of content and
remaining neutral' (Gillespie, 2010: 348). To examine
this further, one important aspect we must consider is
what the `technical architecture [of platforms] allows
and prohibits' (Gillespie, 2010: 359). If the architectural
features of platforms are part of the `engine' that drives
choice, then users are not only passive consumers-
qua-choosers, but also in one sense the Big Data
`fuel' that platforms run on.
The work involved in creating and maintaining plat-
forms involves a heterogeneous array of individuals,
including programmers, designers and paid content
checkers. Users are also an essential element.
Considerable work is involved in navigating, enacting
and co-constructing choice on platforms, as users are
not simply consuming, but also labouring to use, pro-
duce and evaluate content. For example, account repu-
tations on eBay.com are crucial to the economics of the
platform, and responsibility is placed on both sellers
and buyers to attract and maintain positive feedback
from one another. As eBay states: `Some buyers have
been frustrated by the increasing number of sellers who
refuse to accept bids from buyers with a feedback rating
of ``less than 10'' or ``any negative feedback''' (eBay,
2017). Thus to participate on eBay, users must neces-
sarily perform additional work above and beyond the
simplistic characterisation of comparing alternative
options and making a choice (and potentially also
making a transaction).
This fusion of usage and production has been con-
ceptualised in terms of `produsage'. Bruns' notion of
produsage broadly describes the multi-directional
flows of information that characterise the user-led con-
tent-creation environment of contemporary platforms
(Bruns, 2008). In this way, the dualism of the user-
as-consumer (of web content) versus user-as-producer
does not account for the blurring of roles that users
have, whereby they can `switch easily and effortlessly
between these two roles ­ allowing, ultimately, for the
emergence of a hybrid role in between: that of the pro-
duser' (Bruns and Schmidt, 2011: 3­4). Produsers of
choice-infused platforms must perform constant work
to compare between options, experience and enact
choice, and produce and sell goods and services.
Without this work, the platform economy risks a down-
turn or even failure. Platform operators govern an
interactive space that choice runs on (or is an emergent
property of), without needing to curate and control it
directly.
In this sense, platforms tend be oriented towards
what Ritzer has termed `prosumer capitalism' (2015a).
Ritzer and Jurgenson argue that `in producer and con-
sumer capitalism, corporations are likely to exert great
control over the production and/or consumption of
content (goods and services), but in prosumer capital-
ism companies are more likely to stand back and to
meddle less with the prosumers who are producing
and consuming the content' (2010: 31). The idea of
`prosumption' provides an interpretive key to the plat-
form logic of choice-infused websites, which involves
Graham 5
both production and consumption rather than a specific
focus on either one (Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010: 14).
This augments the notion of `produsage' (Bruns and
Schmidt, 2011), as it attends not only to the user experi-
ence, but also the economies and politics of commen-
suration within platforms. It accounts further for the
considerable work or labour that is involved in produ-
cing, navigating and transacting choice on these plat-
forms. Who are prosumers in this scenario? They are
users who not only work to `produse' content in the
web space, but in doing so also shape the market pro-
cesses and economies in which choice operates. Ritzer
provides a key insight, arguing that users are
`. . . increasingly making all-but-the-most-complex
travel arrangements on one's own through various
websites (e.g., Travelocity, Expedia); doing all of the
work on websites such as Amazon.com including
making the appropriate choices for items to be pur-
chased, providing needed delivery and payment infor-
mation, and making one's way through the various
steps needed to complete the process; as buyers doing
the largely digital work of providing a body of infor-
mation on themselves to eBay and if (when) they are
sellers on that which they are offering for sale.' (Ritzer,
2015b: 12)
Through the prosumption processes of such platforms,
users provide free digital labour that is highly beneficial
to other users, but even more so for website operators
(Anderson, 2010). There is a blurring of leisure and
labour time (Fuchs, 2014) that characterises digital pro-
sumption on these platforms. For example, Yelp.com
does not directly sell goods or services, but the devices
and functionalities it provides users to navigate choice
(i.e., comparing businesses and restaurants) generates
massive amounts of data that, as I have argued
before, operationalise and sustain a dynamically chan-
ging landscape of choice through the platform. This
reconfiguration of choice through prosumption on plat-
forms has a performative effect on the market (Callon,
1998), which recursively responds to new and emergent
`prosumer' activities generated around the clock.
Figure 2 shows an example of private services on
PeoplePerHour that are extremely tailored and niche
services, and may be popular today, but not tomorrow.
Platforms configure users as prosumers of a dynamically
shifting landscape of choice, rather than a landscape of
choice that is static (where the options on offer change
relatively infrequently over time, such as one might
experience in a local convenience store or a choice-
infused website such as Ikea.com, for example).
This performative dimension suggests that these
platforms are, drawing on MacKenzie (2006), not
simply `cameras' that present choice and enable com-
parisons between different options, but also `engines'
that drive and expand choice and categories that
come to define choice. This idea resonates with the
notion of platforms as `invisible engines' discussed pre-
viously (see Evans et al., 2006). One implication is that
platform architectures may engender more choice at the
same time as structuring how users (qua produsers)
navigate it. In a sense, these commercially-oriented
large-scale platforms appear to intensify post-Fordist
prosumption processes to a hyper level: goods and ser-
vices are able to be produced, compared and transacted
at great speed. The implication for users is that their
experience of choice is co-extensive with, and

differentiated via, the actions of a multitude of others
who inhabit the platform, which in turn are structured
through the platform architectures. Choice in this sense
`goes beyond' or `overshoots' its conventional bound-
aries, pointing towards the notion of `hyper-choice' as a
relevant way to understand what is happening to choice
and choice-making practices in the context of plat-
forms. Seemingly benign features of platform architec-
tures intensify and produce choice, and more
importantly produce the appearance of choice by struc-
turing the field of action of users in particular ways. In
this sense platform architectures are constitutive of a
productive form of power (Foucault, 1982) that not
only facilitates and constrains action, but, as I will
examine in the next section, also construct and seek
to produce certain forms of subjectivity.
Constructing (or exploiting) choice
through individualisation and
subjectivity
The discussion so far has demonstrated the crucial role
that users have to play in constructing and maintaining
choice-infused platforms. In this final section I will
develop this further by looking at the way in which
platforms actively seek to drive and shape users towards
participating and contributing to the online space,
which seeks to govern users and construct their field
of action in strategic ways. Revisiting the example of
Yelp, we might consider how large-scale consumer
choice platforms such as Yelp constantly present
users with opportunities to `produse' content, for
example by uploading photos and videos of visits to
restaurants as part of their reviews. At the same time,
users are presented with `offer[s] of subjectivation'
(Latour, 2005: 213) that simultaneously individualise
them and also produce content that relates to and
produces knowledge about the options on offer. For
example, Figure 3 shows how each photo uploaded
by `Jane D.' (de-identified alias) has a `like' button
(i.e., unary rating), which offers users a chance to
become `produsers' and not only evaluate Jane D.'s
content, but also take up this offer of subjectivation
to express themselves as someone who `likes' the food
and beverages from the restaurant that is under evalu-
ation (i.e., `Coffee Anthology').
In contrast to the liberalist perspective that choice
constitutes the freedom that individuals have to make
rational decisions, this example of Yelp further serves
to illustrate how choice on platforms is something that
can be engineered, shaped, calculated and governed in
order to `structure the possible field of action' of users
(Foucault, 1982: 790). Foucault argues that there is a
key relationship between the choosing subject and the
notion of `interest', that is, `a subject of interest, by
which I mean a source of interest, the starting point
of an interest, or the site of a mechanism of interests'
(Foucault and Senellart, 2008: 273). Thus the interests
of the subject (in this case user) become the interests of
government (platform operator): users become the cor-
relate of a governmentality that manufactures and
shapes the environment and variables in which
`choice' is exercised. As web users we are no less `gov-
erned through our freedom' than in other domains of

existence (Rose, 1999: 62) and we exercise `free choice'
on platforms that shape and govern us through our
agential capacities. Thus platforms offer particular
kinds of subjectivity to users, and moreover these are
digitally mediated consumer subjectivities that construct
users as distinctly neoliberal subjects. Sauter (2013)
draws on Rose's ideas to highlight `how information
and communication technologies (ICTs) contribute to
converting the rational-economic expectations of neo-
liberal governments into the subjective personal aims of
citizens' (2013: 8). Applying this to examine the
Pinterest platform, Sauter argues that it `encourage[s]
users to self-manage their lives, maximise their poten-
tial . . . constantly seeking to improve and perfect them-
selves and display this activity publicly' (2013: 8). Thus
platforms such as Yelp do not simply provide tools for
users to make comparisons and enact choice, but offer
opportunities to become the kinds of citizen-consumer
subjects that align with, or do not deviate too far from,
the goals and rationalities of the platform (such as the
accumulation and retention of users).
In advancing this argument further, we observe how
platform users are often subjected to technologies of
performance measurement that provides numeric
levels of their contribution to the platform (e.g.,
`Level 3 Contributor'), which is attributed to, and
makes up, their individual profile. This configures
users towards a logic of competition and self-
advancement that is expressed through their individu-
ality. Figure 4 exemplifies the subjectification of users
on Tripadvisor.co.uk, quantifying and measuring their
activity or contribution to the platform by measuring it
quantitatively. Activity conducted within the web space
is tied to the self through the individualising effects of
profiles (e.g., `Jill Smith' is a Level 5 Contributor), and
becomes meaningful in the context of the broad net-
worked public composed of individuals who convene
together in the online space (boyd, 2011). Indeed,
beyond the illustrative example provided here, the
quantification of these kinds of user practices has
been studied empirically by David and Pinch (2006)
and Pinch (2012).
It follows that a key aspect of individualisation and
subjectivation on choice-infused platforms is the role of
the user profile. As Graham argues, platforms often
urge users to log into the site using existing social net-
working site (SNS) profiles under the proviso that
doing so is much faster and more convenient than set-
ting up a new user profile manually (2016: 206).
Moreover, if a user decides to log in using their SNS
profile, they are subsequently using the site not as an
anonymous reader, but in a sense as themselves. Unlike
other kinds of web spaces, users of these platforms are
not anonymous and undifferentiated entities, but are
configured as unique individuals with a self-identifying
name and personalising characteristics and attributes,
visible to private social networks and networked pub-
lics. For example, if a user of TripAdvisor logs in using
their Facebook account and clicks `like' on a particular
hotel, they are liking the hotel in the capacity of their
self. They authorise the platform to use their data,
which, in the case of Facebook, often includes rich
and detailed personal information, and this in turn is
redeployed by the platform.
Figure 4. Individualisation and subjectification of users through performance measurement (TripAdvisor.com).
8 Big Data & Society
As Figure 5 shows, Trip Advisor co-opts users' exist-
ing social networks to encourage them to join their
friends by participating within the site. This is an
offer that the user can accept or refuse ­ if they refuse
to sign in with Facebook, they subsequently miss out
on participating on TripAdvisor as part of their friend-
ship network. This `offer of subjectivation' (Latour,
2005: 213) incites the user to operate as a unique and
authentic user-consumer and produser of the platform,
i.e., a user who is configured within a consumerist dis-
course of choice and is actively enrolled in producing,
for example, reviews and ratings that are visible to, and
open to evaluation from, private social networks and
the general networked public. To the extent that users
engage with and take up these offers of subjectivation,
platforms have a productive power that creates certain
forms of subjectivity as digitally experienced expres-
sions of self. To be sure, I am not suggesting that plat-
forms cause or determine particular forms of
subjectivity, but rather that these technologies `attri-
bute various capacities, qualities and statuses to par-
ticular agents . . . that these agents come to experience
themselves through' (Dean, 2010: 44).
Thus the design architecture of choice-infused plat-
forms attempts to link up the interests and rationalities
of the operators with the interests and self-governing
capacities of users. If users are satisfied, they will come
back, are more likely to make a transaction, and they
will keep produsing content within the space. As previ-
ously discussed, this provides free digital labour for
platforms (Amazon built an empire on user-submitted
ratings), and users may do so because in varying
degrees they govern themselves through and/or are
affected by the labels, badges and categories that signify
individuality, social status, reputation and achievement
(e.g., `Top #100 reviewer' on Amazon, or `100% posi-
tive feedback' on eBay). Ekbia and Nardi reason about
the `affective rewards' that these types of systems pro-
duce, arguing that users and enterprises (read here as
platforms) both gain benefits, although the benefits are
asymmetrically weighted in favour of enterprises (2014,
section 1.2). These processes of governing users
through their affective subjectivities shapes and drive
choice by configuring users as instruments of know-
ledge production (e.g., generating ratings and reviews).
Both the platform and the user are not left unchanged
by their interactions and entanglement in this environ-
ment constructed through flows of Big Data and
practices of categorisation and commensuration.
A particular type of choice and experience of choice-
making is produced with and via the self-governing
capacities, actions, and individuality of users. As
Introna argues, `they [users] internalize these calculat-
ing practices, and the knowledge they legitimate, to
become self-governed subjects' (2016: 36). Individuals'
subjectivities and interests link up to, and become

enmeshed with, the interests and rationalities of
platforms.
This is interesting in light of Bucher's argument that
algorithms that underpin Web 2.0 may lead users to
internalise the subjectivities of the website operators
(2012). It may be possible that website users, through
repeated use of categories over time, may come to
internalise the subjectivities of the website operators,
which I have identified here in the context of choice-
infused platforms as pro-capitalist and characteristic-
ally neoliberal constructions of self. As Hearn (2010)
argues, Web 2.0 practices `function to direct human
meaning-making and self-identity in highly motivated
and profitable ways' (abstract, 2010). Again, this is not
to argue that these processes are deterministic, but to
highlight a powerful aspect of how such platforms
shape both choice and users. Thus platforms may in
fact intensify and reproduce consumerist and pro-capi-
talist modalities of choice, contributing to the expan-
sion of consumer choice (read hyper-choice) that I
discussed in the introduction to this paper, whilst at
the same time ostensibly appearing to reduce and
narrow down choice for users.
Although these kinds of governmental strategies and
effects are certainly not reducible to choice, it is evident
that choice, platform architectures and users are bound
up together in a complex relationship. To a certain
extent, platforms and individual subjectivity are
co-constitutive, existing and transforming in a feedback
loop mediated through the architecture of the space.
Choice, in this platform configuration, appears to
take on a machinic aspect as it is not clear where the
machine (platform features and architecture) starts and
the human (user) ends. In this sense choice appears to
have an inter-objectivity that resonates with Morton's
notion of `hyperobjects', whereby `nothing is ever
experienced directly, but only as mediated through
other entities in some shared sensual space' (2013:
86). Although I would not go so far as to construe
choice as a hyperobject in the broader sense used by
Morton, in the context of large-scale platforms choice
and choice-making practices appear to exhibit `hyper'
qualities. For example, we come to know the value of
things through ratings devices, which mediate the opin-
ions and experiential knowledge of an unknown public
distributed across space and time (`product X has a
2-star rating based on 1,000 user ratings'). Similarly,
we come to know the identities of human entities on
platforms through the platform-specific systems of clas-
sification that are used to categorise, order and differ-
entiate them. Thus, as for technology and human
agency more generally, platforms, users, and choice
do not merely have complex relationships, but in dif-
fering degrees co-constitute one another (Verbeek,
2005). Choice in the context of platforms transcends
our conventional understandings of it, both ontologic-
ally (what choice is and the entities that are involved)
and epistemologically (how choice is categorised,
ordered and produced, as well as the shifting practices
and dynamics of choice-making).
Conclusion
In this paper I have argued that large-scale web-based
platforms such as Amazon, Yelp and TripAdvisor not
only enable users to experience and enact choice, but
presuppose and engender a kind of `hyper-choice' that
goes beyond, overshoots, and fundamentally challenges
our normal understanding of what choice is and how it
is constituted. In developing this idea, I made four main
arguments.
Firstly, the myriad ratings, reviews and ranking
devices deployed by platforms combined with large vol-
umes of user-generated Big Data have resulted in a
fundamental reconfiguration of knowledge production
about choice that reimagines, re-specifies, and perhaps
in some cases nullifies, pre-existing standards and
systems that used to define choice. For example,
TripAdvisor's rating system collapses longstanding
industry standards for differentiating accommodation
options.
Secondly, platform architectures have brought about
a breakdown or hybridisation of longstanding dualisms
that we use to understand consumer choice and web
use, such as producers versus consumers and users
versus producers. As a result, consumer choice on plat-
forms such as Yelp requires new conceptual devices to
understand how it is enacted, who and what is involved
in the production and reproduction of markets, and
how to make sense of the increasingly blurred lines
between choice and choosers.
Thirdly, I examined productive modes of power
whereby platforms actively seek to shape and construct
subjectivities so that users come to govern themselves in
ways that do not deviate too far from the goals of the
platform. Platform architectures are not designed for
users inasmuch as they are designed with and around
the self-governing and individual agential capacities of
individuals. What we understand as choice is not
a priori to platforms, but instead platforms construct
particular forms of choice and experiences of choice-
making. In effect, platform architectures actively seek
to produce and reproduce particular kinds of con-
sumerist and neoliberal subjectivities that link up with
the aims, rationalities and imaginaries of platform
operators.
Finally, from a user-centric perspective I point
towards the curious, perhaps even paradoxical, notion
that these large-scale choice-infused platforms might
contribute to reconfiguring, driving, expanding and
10 Big Data & Society
speeding up choice at the same time as presenting a
structured space in which users navigate and narrow
down an overabundance of it. To be sure, this paper
has only considered specific aspects of platforms,
namely the ratings and rankings devices deployed by
them, as well as theories that help us make sense of
platform architectures vis-a
` -vis `choice'. Space pre-
cluded a more comprehensive consideration of other
key dimensions of platforms, including recommender
systems, the politics of algorithms, and data practices,
to name a few. Further, this study focussed on con-
sumer choice (rather than choice more broadly) and
practices of choice and consumption in privileged and
predominantly Western countries. The over-abundance
of choice and accessibility of Internet technologies
experienced in these geographies is not universal. I
note these as limitations of the study and key areas
for future work.
In conclusion, there is something markedly different
about choice in an increasingly platform-saturated web.
Choice has in a sense become hyper ­ the technical,
social, and political infrastructures of platforms have
rapidly reconfigured our experience of choice and our
roles in relation to it. Perhaps in some ways large-scale
platforms such as Yelp and TripAdvisor have transi-
tioned beyond our conventional understandings of
choice and choosers. In various modes and levels of
intensity we are confronted with a complex, hybrid,
perhaps even paradoxical, picture: is this the emerging
condition of hyper-choice in platform environments?
