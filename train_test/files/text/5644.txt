Complementary social science?
Quali-quantitative experiments
in a Big Data world
Anders Blok1 and Morten Axel Pedersen2
Abstract
The rise of Big Data in the social realm poses significant questions at the intersection of science, technology, and society,
including in terms of how new large-scale social databases are currently changing the methods, epistemologies, and
politics of social science. In this commentary, we address such epochal (``large-scale'') questions by way of a (situated)
experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physi-
cists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure,
meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N > 1000).
At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On
this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the
Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking
Bohr's principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend
crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and
polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care.
These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of
societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.

Introduction
The information regarding the behaviour of one and the
same object under mutually exclusive experimental set-
tings may . . . , in an often-used expression within atomic
physics, suitably be characterized as complementary, in
that ­ although their description in everyday language
cannot be subsumed into one whole ­ they nevertheless
each express equally important aspects of the total sum
of thinkable experiences regarding the object. (Bohr,
1957 [1938]: 38; authors' translation)
Such were the words of the renowned physicist Niels
Bohr (1885­1962) in a talk he delivered in 1938 to an
audience of Danish anthropologists. We cite this pas-
sage because we want to ask: how can Bohr's ``principle
of complementarity'' be brought to bear on current
interdisciplinary research fields in the social sciences,
which comprise both quantitative and qualitative meth-
ods and data-sets? Indeed, may Bohr's far-reaching
thinking inspire us to conjure a new epistemology as
well as a new politics of ``quali-quantitative'' (Latour
et al., 2012) methods for the social sciences?

It is important to note that, while Bohr was and still
today is hailed for his contribution to modern physics,
``[t]he full radical nature of Bohr's views has not always
been recognized'' by physicists (Pinch, 2011: 6­7).
Indeed, within both the natural and the social sciences,
there is widespread skepticism if not downright hostility
towards bringing together radically different research
methods and traditions in the hope of generating new
and better insights into complex phenomena. The cross-
disciplinary field of ``computational social science'' is a
case in point. Consider the following two citations,
taken from the agenda-setting 2009 Science paper co-
authored by leading researchers from this nascent field,
and from a recent column in Huffington Post by US
anthropologist Paul Stoller (2013):
In short, a computational social science is emerging
that leverages the capacity to collect and analyze data
with an unprecedented breadth and depth and scale.
(Lazer et al., 2009: 722)
The problem of Big Data is here to stay, which means
that in the coming months and years we'll need a legion
of ethnographically trained analysts to produce `Thick
Data' ­ to save us from ourselves. (Stoller, 2013)
Lazer et al. (2009), of course, echo broader visions
(in)famously made on behalf of the scientific ``Big
Data revolution'' such as Chris Anderson's controver-
sial claim about a supposed ``end of theory'' (2008). On
his part, Stoller draws heavily on a blog posting by
Tricia Wang (2013), who argues that ``ethnographers
must engage with Big Data,'' for fear of being ``mini-
mized as a small line item on a budget, and relegated to
the small data corner.''
Our ambition in this piece is to sketch an alternative
to these two mutually exclusive (and mutually hostile)
understandings of the role and value of (seemingly)
``big'' quantitative data and (seemingly) ``small'' quali-
tative data methods and approaches in contemporary
research and society. To do so, we pose the following
questions: how do the kinds of knowledge that can be
obtained from ``Big'' (computational) and ``Small''
(ethnographic) data, respectively, relate or not relate?
Indeed, beyond the suggestion of Stoller and ``like-
minded'' social scientists voicing tout court concern
about Big Data, might the notion of thick data
(c.f. op cit; see also Boellstorff, 2013) be put to better
use to denote what relates, rather than what separates,
innovative approaches to future social science experi-
ments? Invoking Bohr's principle of complementarity,
we contend that social relations, as objects of both sci-
entific and everyday knowledge, indeed depend on the
type of measurement device deployed for their observa-
tion. At the same time, we propose that new productive
interferences may be expected to arise at the intersec-
tion of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so
to speak, mixed with care.
Below, we explore such questions by way of discuss-
ing a specific social science experiment, which attempts
to mix computational and ethnographic methods
into what might be dubbed ``Complementary Social
Science,'' namely the Copenhagen Social Networks
Study. In this research project, an interdisciplinary
group of computer scientists, physicists, economists,
sociologists and anthropologists (including our-
selves) has recently embarked on a novel attempt to
combine quantitative width and qualitative depth in
mapping the spatio-temporal details of a concrete
social network.
Social fabric: Remixing mixed methods
The Copenhagen Social Networks Study is a large-scale
cross-disciplinary research program jointly hosted by the
Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Copenhagen,
and the Department of Informatics and Mathematical
Modelling at the Danish Technical University (DTU).
Our 25-plus member big team collaborates to make con-
tinuous recordings of social interactions at all commu-
nication channels among an entire freshman class
(N > 1000) of DTU students, using smart phones distrib-
uted to students (as well as to members of the project
group) as measurement devices (``socio-meters''). This
allows us to digitally map out the ``complete'' social net-
work of an entire freshman class, including face-to-face
encounters via Bluetooth, geo-location proximities via
GPS, social network data via apps, and telecommunica-
tion data via call logs. The set-up also includes, by way
of ``embedding'' an anthropologist within the freshmen
group for an entire year, ``thick'' ethnographic fieldwork
data on friendship and other social relations amongst the
same group of students. Simultaneously, researchers
track different components of the social fabric via the
application of established survey methods (for an over-
view, see Stopczynski et al., 2014). This vast and hetero-
geneous collection of data on a large-scale social
network infrastructure is being used to study:
(i) How information and influence are transmitted
and transformed in the DTU ``social fabric''
(ii) How friendships, networks and behaviors form,
offline and online
(iii) How the researchers themselves study ``Big Data''
and handle issues of ethics and privacy
Within this framework, a team of sociologists and
anthropologists (senior scholars, doctoral students, and
undergraduates) from Copenhagen University, led by
the two of us, conduct a joint ``Ant-Soc'' work package,
2 Big Data & Society
which aims to push current boundaries for mixing and
cross-fertilizing quantitatively and qualitatively based
social network research. We do this by exploring a
number of closely interrelated research questions,
themes and methods at the core of current concerns
in sociology, anthropology, and science and technology
studies (STS) ­ as well as in the cross-disciplinary fields
of computational, digital, and experimental social sci-
ence ­ including:
. Ethnographic fieldwork ­ how can ethnographic stu-
dies of friendship and other social network relations
amongst students enrich or challenge computational
approaches ­ and vice versa?
. Quali-quantitative methods ­ does the rise of com-
putational social science lead to a reconfiguration of
traditional splits between quantitative and qualita-
tive research methods?
. Big data experiments ­ what kinds of anthropo-
logical and sociological experiments does our set-
up enable, and how might such innovations enrich
existing social-scientific designs?
. Social life of Big Data ­ what new ethical, political
and organizational challenges and opportunities
does the rise of large-scale social databases pose to
the social sciences and society at large?
. Research collaboration ­ taken as an object of STS,
what may be learned about cross-disciplinary collab-
oration from the research program itself?
In terms of social science methods, the unique cross-
disciplinary and cross-institutional set-up of the
Copenhagen Social Networks Study allows for drawing
together two hitherto distinct literatures, on computa-
tional social science (e.g. Lazer et al., 2009) and mixed
methods (e.g. Creswell, 2011), respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, researchers in computational social
science are yet to acknowledge the potential significance
to their work of grounded participant-observation in
the ethnographic tradition. Conversely, the mixed
methods literature so far has not picked up the chal-
lenges and opportunities of large-scale digital data, and
is therefore at risk of remaining trapped within an
obsolete distinction between qualitative and quantita-
tive (i.e. survey-based) approaches. This methodo-
logical remixing ­ which allows for new ways of
stitching together computational and ethnographic
data ­ is what we propose to dub ``complementary
social science.''
Bohr revisited: A complementary
social science?
What can we say about the relationship between ``big''
or ``deep'' (i.e. computational) and ``small'' or ``thick''
(i.e. ethnographic) data approaches in light of our
experiences from the Copenhagen Social Networks
Study project so far? To begin with, the collaborative
research vision we advocate here differs from the hostile
stance towards Big Data by increasing numbers of
qualitative social scientists. Valuable as the emerging
Critical Big Data Studies Paradigm (as one might call
it) undoubtedly will prove to be, it tacitly relies upon
and thus reproduces a problematic bifurcation between
``hard'' quantitative evidence in need of further inter-
pretation and ``soft'' qualitative data imbued with ``the
meaning'' needed to close this hermeneutic gap.
As Boyd and Crawford (2012: 670) write, echoing
Stoller's and Wang's positions:
[I]t is increasingly important to recognize the value of
`small data'. [. . .] Take, for example, the work of Veinot
(2007), who followed one worker ­ a vault inspector at
a hydroelectric utility company ­ in order to under-
stand the information practices of a blue-collar
worker. [. . .] Her work tells a story that could not be
discovered by farming millions of Facebook or Twitter
accounts.
While we very much sympathize with Boyd and
Crawford's ambition to affirm the lasting value of eth-
nography and its critical potential, arguments such as
the above also tend to reproduce prevailing assump-
tions that ``big'' and ``small'' data and methods are
simply mutually exclusive. This runs counter to what
we would like to think the Copenhagen Social
Networks Study project allows for, which is to make
``big'' and ``small'' data mutually dependent and enhan-
cing, and thus potentially recalibrate this and other
unhelpful bifurcations between so-called quantitative
and so-called qualitative data worlds. That, after all,
is what complementarity in Bohr's definition was all
about: an epistemological and ontological predicament,
whereby two phenomena or processes are at one and
the same time totally disparate and totally interdepend-
ent. As Karen Barad (2011: 444) puts the point:
``Complementarity entails two important features:
mutual exclusivity and mutual necessity. For two vari-
ables to be complementary they have to be both simul-
taneously necessary and mutually exclusive. Otherwise,
what is the paradox?''. Critical Big Data studies, it
seems to us, risk losing the paradox of complementarity
rather than benefitting from it.
Another problem with such an emerging ``critical
consensus'' amongst qualitative social scientists is its
overly narrow understanding of what critique is.
Put bluntly, there is something unsatisfactory
about reducing the intervention that sociologists and
anthropologists like us can make on Big Data realities
and discourses to a one-dimensional question of
Blok and Pedersen 3
deconstruction and debunking. Again, we are of course
not claiming that allegedly ``neutral'' incipient hege-
monic discourses on, e.g., so-called non-theoretical
computational social science can and should not be
questioned. All we are suggesting is that too much
default Big Data bashing runs the risk of tacitly relying
on an assumed vantage point from outside these dis-
courses and practices ­ a quite conservative observa-
tional ``fly on the wall'' position from which the
anthropologist and sociologist are taken to enjoy
unique access to both her object of study and a broader
``context'' of which it is supposedly a ``part'' (cf. Riles,
1998). Take, for instance, Mike Savage and Roger
Burrows's (2007) otherwise pertinent points about
what they (following Nigel Thrift) dub ``knowing cap-
italism''; surely, we might counter, there is more to the
Big Data challenge than merely diagnosing a new form
of capitalism?
In the Copenhagen Social Networks Study project,
adopting such a conservative notion of critique would
entail that physicists like Sune Lehman (the PI from
DTU) were located fully within the large-scale social
network database investigated by our interdisciplinary
team, whereas sociologists and anthropologists, such as
the two of us, would be positioned on the outside of this
Big Data reality and discourse. All we would do (or
pretend to be doing) as so-called critical anthropolo-
gists and sociologists, then, would be to observe pur-
portedly ``native'' computational social scientists by
looking at them from the outside in, seeking to identify,
monitor, trace, describe and ultimately decode the more
or less exotic ideas and practices of this scientific
``tribe.'' Yet, exciting and self-satisfying as this would
undoubtedly be, we would thereby end up replicating
the dubious assumptions about mutual exclusivity
between quantitative Big Data and qualitative small
data social science that we set out to transcend in the
first place.
Our vision of a complementary social science is
meant to offer a way of avoiding such pitfalls. By
attempting to mix and even merge our own research
agendas, perspectives, and methodologies with our
``native'' computational social scientific ``informants,''
we have from the onset of the project attempted to
position ourselves within the large-scale social network
database under investigation, not on the outside of it ­
as would be the aspiration of many conventional
science studies approaches. For only by in this way
strategically striving to partly collapse our own
research interests with those of the other researchers
involved in the Copenhagen Social Networks Study
can we hope to move from mutual exclusivity to inter-
dependency in the complementarity between computa-
tional and ethnographic approaches. We like to think
of this as a germane strategy for gradually
reconfiguring the very epistemological, methodological,
and political playing field onto which the recently
much-hyped discourses of ``Big Data'' social science
make claim. As an attempt to work around and thus
distort what is on the inside and what is on the outside
of various conventionalized bifurcations and contrasts
(researcher vs. research object; natural science vs. social
science/humanities; ``hard'' quantitative vs. ``soft''
qualitative data and approaches), our vision of a com-
plementary social science contains the promise of an
``immanent,'' non-skeptical critique (cf. Holbraad
et al., 2013) of narrowly technical and neo-positivist
celebrations of Big Data in research as well as non-
research contexts.
Quali-quantitative methods
In a recent article aptly entitled ``The whole is always
smaller than its parts,'' Latour et al. ask:
[. . .] [I]s there a way to define what is a longer lasting
social order without making the assumption that there
exist two levels [of individuals and structures]. [. . .]
Instead of having to choose and thus to jump from
individuals to wholes, from micro to macro, [we want
to] occupy all sorts of other positions, constantly rear-
ranging the way profiles are interconnected and over-
lapping. (2012: 591)
To a large extent, this passage captures what the two of
us hope to achieve from our quest to laterally assemble
into a single research reality (or ``research
relationality'') the two hitherto bifurcated social scien-
tific arenas of Big and Small data: by stubbornly resist-
ing the temptation to perceive the cross-disciplinary
Copenhagen Social Networks Study as comprised by
two mutually exclusive methodological and
epistemological domains ­ a quantitative and a
qualitative one, respectively ­ we wish to insist on the
potential for new and progressive forms of what Latour
et al. (2012) dub ``quali-quantitative methods.'' This,
however, raises a new order of urgent questions.
It is becoming increasingly clear that, within algo-
rithmically generated Big Data worlds such as the
digital database generated in our research program,
the ``part'' is indeed often bigger than the ``whole,'' as
Latour et al. suggest. This is illustrated, for instance, by
the way in which complexity in quantitative social net-
work mappings tends to increase, as opposed
to decrease, the moment one looks not for ``aggregate''
static structures but for the replication, say, of ever
more fine-grained ``temporal motifs'' in dynamic inter-
action patterns across smaller groups (Kovanen et al.,
2011). But are such granularities necessarily the same in
Big and Small data worlds?
4 Big Data & Society
By investing so heavily in the promises of new large-
scale ``digital trace'' databases, Latour et al. may risk
losing sight of the ways in which disparate data worlds
rub off against and emerge from each other, rather than
producing new seamless ``wholes.'' Within computa-
tional social science, for instance, the focus on granu-
larity ``drives forward a concern with the microscopic,
the way that amalgamations of databases can allow
ever more granular, unique, specification''
(Ruppert et al., 2013: 38). Accordingly, in the
Copenhagen Social Networks Study project, we hope
to extend the method of quali-quantitative research by
making the very study of social relations ­ by means of
ethnographic fieldwork, surveys, digital traces, and so
on ­ part and parcel of the experimental set-up itself.
By doing so, we put ourselves in a position to experi-
ment on social science complementarity in practice:
how, we ask, may our experimental settings of obser-
vation themselves be experimentally varied so as to
create different kinds of mutual necessity between Big
(computational) and Small (ethnographic) data? What
forms of ``granularity,'' ``thickness,'' and ``depth'' arise
from engaging in, rather than simply tracing, concrete
work of computational data design, compilation and
assemblage, alongside ethnographic descriptions (see
also Kockelman, 2013)?
In pursuing this kind of experimental approach, new
and difficult questions of research ethics emerge, in part
because established conventions on how to deal respon-
sibly with issues of privacy, confidentiality, etc., differ
widely between (and to some degree also within) com-
putational and ethnographic approaches. Here as well,
however, much-needed dialogues and imports should
go both ways, as computational researchers stand to
learn from routine experiences, on the part of field-
workers, of gaining access to ``private'' layers of peo-
ple's lives far beyond what should ever be conveyed in
``public'' research. We need to ask: what could ethically
appropriate, and indeed ethically desirable, forms of
complementary social science data be?
At this relatively early stage of our collective endea-
vors, it is still premature to give definite answers to such
epistemological and ethical questions. What we can
provide, however, is a flavor of what we have in
mind. For example: how might the combination of
ethnographic embedding and computational data help
us understand the way various affective moods,
impulses, and rumors spread throughout a collectivity?
As Ruppert et al. (2013: 35) suggest, the transactional
data favored by most computational social science
lends itself to entirely ``non-individualist'' accounts of
social life, where the play of fluid and dynamic trans-
actions is the focus of attention. In our setting, one
question might be: what role does parties and partying
play in the formation of social connections, and how
can we quantify the importance of ``ambience,'' ``atmos-
phere,'' ``togetherness,'' and so on in this respect ­
``quali-quantities'' which, from a standard sociological
and anthropological point of view, would be purely
qualitative? What, in turn, might such new data assem-
blages that ``stitch together'' data worlds produced
through computational and ethnographic methods do
to established concepts of ``personhood,'' ``sociality,''
and ``politics''?
Conclusion
We are well aware that our vision of a complementary
social science for the 21st century raises many new
questions and numerous potential objections. Apart
from the sheer ``technical'' challenges of remixing dif-
ferent methods, devices, infrastructures, and data forms
(ranging from ethnographic field notes to database
algorithms) into ``thick'' data, questions arise at the
heart of the philosophy of science. For example: if it
is indeed the case that, in computational social science,
we leave behind the search for causal statistical model-
ing and enter a new world of visual ``pattern recogni-
tion'' (Ruppert et al., 2013: 36), then what happens to
time-honored distinctions between numbers and narra-
tives; description and explanation; and indeed, simula-
tion and the real world? Such questions, it seems to us,
are not just becoming ever more pertinent with ongoing
digital social database developments (including recent
scares and scandals). They can also only be addressed
in the same ``messy'' interface between basic research,
social and political engagement, and collaborative
experimentation, which Niels Bohr pioneered in
his time.
Furthermore, as noted, our vision of a complemen-
tary social science must respond to legitimate and
urgent ethical and political concerns ­ raised by both
critics and supporters of computational data ­ with
regard to issues of surveillance, privacy, and future
misuse of data. Once again, without claiming to have
in any way ``solved'' these issues, the Copenhagen
Social Networks Study team has already taken some
important steps in trying to make data available to
the research subjects themselves via apps and websites
(including the official project website: https://
www.sensible.dtu.dk/), as well as more interactive on-
and offline forums, and by including members of the
project team themselves in the experiment. In this sense,
our notion of complementarity extends to the mutual
dependencies of researchers and their subjects; to the
greatest extent possible, research subjects should be cast
as co-producers of knowledge about themselves, just as
researchers should strive whenever feasible to render
themselves subject to their own research questions
and methods. Our collaborative research program,
Blok and Pedersen 5
then, is not just about methods and results; it is also,
more broadly or ``thickly,'' an experiment in ``data
democracy.''
