Introduction
Although improvements have been observed in type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (T2DM) risk factors over the last decade,
many risk factors remain sub-optimally controlled or
poorly recognized.1 For example, data suggest that intra-
abdominal (visceral) adipose tissue (VAT) may be a pri-
mary driver of the cardiometabolic complications of
obesity, including T2DM.2 Multiple factors including very
low calorie diets, exercise3 and bariatric surgery4 result in
significant reductions in VAT, potentially explaining some
of the improvements in glycaemic control and resolution
of T2DM seen with lifestyle and surgical interventions.5
Unfortunately, some of the available therapies for T2DM,
in particular sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones and insu-
lin therapy, result in weight gain and may exacerbate the
adverse effects of VAT in patients with T2DM.6
Empagliflozin (EMPA) is a potent and selective
sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) used
for the treatment of T2DM shown to improve glycaemic
control and reduce blood pressure and body weight in
clinical trials.7­11 In a dedicated body composition study,
EMPA treatment led to significant reductions in abdomi-
nal fat compared with glimepiride over 104
weeks.12

Abstract
Aims: To determine the effects of empagliflozin on adiposity indices among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods: Changes in weight, waist circumference, estimated total body fat, index of central obesity and visceral
adiposity index were assessed using analysis of covariance and testing of treatment by strata for age, sex and baseline
waist circumference in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus randomized to blinded treatment with empagliflozin versus
placebo in clinical trials of 12weeks (cohort 1) or 24weeks (cohort 2) duration.
Results: This study comprised 3300 patients (cohort 1, N=823; cohort 2, N
=
2477). Empagliflozin reduced weight,
waist circumference and adiposity indices versus placebo in both cohorts. Adjusted mean (95% confidence interval)
change from baseline in empagliflozin versus placebo was -1.7kg (-2.1 to -1.4kg) and -1.9kg (-2.1 to -1.7kg) for body
weight (p<0.001); -1.3cm (-1.8 to -0.7cm) and -1.3cm (-1.7 to -1.0cm) for waist circumference (p<0.001); -0.2%
(-0.7% to 0.3%; p
=
0.45) and -0.3% (-0.7% to 0.0%; p
=
0.08) for estimated total body fat; -0.007 (-0.011 to -0.004)
and -0.008 (-0.010 to -0.006) for index of central obesity (p<0.001); and -0.3 (-0.5 to 0.0; p=0.07) and -0.4 (-0.7 to
-0.1; p=0.003) for visceral adiposity index in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Adipose reductions were seen across most
age, sex and waist circumference subgroups.
Conclusion: Empagliflozin significantly reduced weight and adiposity indices with the potential to improve cardiometabolic
risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Multiple surrogate indices of visceral adiposity have
been developed that do not require advanced imaging
techniques, are more readily applied in the clinical set-
ting and have been validated with metabolic risk factors
and imaging modalities;13 however, generalizability of
many equations is limited due to a lesser degree of vali-
dation among various race or ethnic groups and at the
extremes body composition. As data describing the
effects of EMPA on these more clinically available and,
therefore, more relevant indices of VAT are lacking, we
aimed to determine its effects compared with placebo on
body weight, waist circumference (WC) and indices of
total body fat and visceral adiposity over a short and
intermediate treatment term among patients with T2DM
enrolled in five clinical trials.
Materials and methods
Study population
Data from two cohorts of patients participating in rand-
omized trials, one treated with double-blind EMPA versus
placebo for 12weeks (cohort 1) and one treated with dou-
ble-blind EMPA versus placebo for 24
weeks (cohort 2),
were analysed. Cohort 1 comprised participants in the
EMPA-REG BPTM trial; details of the trial population and
design have been published previously.7 Briefly, patients
with T2DM [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7%
and 10%], hypertension (defined as mean seated office
systolic blood pressure 130­159
mmHg and diastolic
blood pressure 80­99mmHg) and body mass index (BMI)
45kg/m2 were randomized to receive EMPA 10
mg,
EMPA 25mg or placebo once daily for 12weeks. Patients
underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
7dayspriortorandomizationandatweek12.Background
antihypertensive therapy was continued throughout the
study. Cohort 2 comprised participants in four trials:
EMPA-REG PIOTM,8 EMPA-REG MONOTM,9 EMPA-
REG METSUTM10 and EMPA-REG METTM;11 details of
the trial populations and designs are published elsewhere.
Briefly, all participants in these trials generally had
HbA1c7% and 10% and BMI
45kg/m2 and were
randomized to receive EMPA 10mg, EMPA 25mg or pla-
cebo as monotherapy (EMPA-REG MONOTM) or add-on
to background therapies metformin, metformin plus sul-
phonylurea or pioglitazone with or without metformin
(EMPA-REG METTM, EMPA-REG METSUTM and
EMPA-REG PIOTM) for 24weeks. All participants in these
studies provided written informed consent, and all studies
were approved by the Institutional Review Boards and
IndependentEthicsCommitteesandCompetentAuthorities
of the participating centres in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with the
International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized
Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice.
Variable definitions and biomarker
measurements
Blood pressure was measured three times (approximately
2min apart) after 5min of rest in the seated position, using
the same arm, method and device throughout the trials.
HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were assessed from
blood samples taken during visits at the trial sites before
breakfast and before daily dose of study medication and
analysed at a central laboratory using validated assays
(VariantTM II Turbo ion-exchange high-performance liquid
chromatography, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, for
HbA1c measurements; Gluco-quant Roche/Hitachi
Modular glucose analyser, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany, for plasma glucose measurements).
Body composition endpoints
Apart from body weight (kg) and WC (cm) that were meas-
ured directly, the following previously published indices
were selected based on the evidence available to reflect
abdominal fat depots,13 `ease-of-use' from a clinical
practice point of view and availability of data comprising
the formulae in the EMPA phase III clinical trial database
and were used to estimate body fat content and distribu-
tion: estimated total body fat (eTBF, YMCA formula):
100×[-98.42+(4.15×
WC (in)) - (0.082
×weight
(lbs))]/weight for men and 100
×[-76.76+(4.15×WC)
- (0.082×weight)]/weight for women;14,15 index of central
obesity (ICO): WC/body height, constructed to account for
race- and sex-specific cut-offs for WC reflecting variability
in average heights in these populations;16 and visceral adi-
posity index (VAI): [WC (cm)/(39.68
+(1.88×BMI (kg/
m2)))]×
[triglycerides (TGs, mmol/L)/1.03]
×[1.31/high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, mmol/L)] for men;
[WC/(36.58+(1.89×BMI))]×(TG/0.81)×(1.52/HDL-
C) for women, derived to incorporate the atherogenic dys-
lipidemia seen with excess visceral adiposity in addition to
anthropometric indices.17 These indices have been shown
to closely correlate with cardiometabolic risk factors in
multiple investigations18,19 and in some cases proved supe-
rior to existing indices of central obesity to predict meta-
bolic syndrome.20 Furthermore, in a post hoc analysis of a
subset of the 1549 patients with T2DM randomized to
treatment with EMPA versus glimepiride in the EMPA-
REG H2H SUTM trial, we found strong correlations between
eTBF (YMCA formula) and total body fat by dual x-ray
absorptiometry and between WC and ICO and abdominal
VAT by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), validating the
use of these indices in relation to direct measures of VAT
and total body fat in a similar population of middle-aged,
overweight and obese patients with T2DM.13 Moreover, the
individual parameters used to derive these markers are
readily available in the clinical setting and can be applied
across a broad spectrum of populations. All endpoints were
Neeland et al. 121
assessed at baseline and at week 12 (cohort 1) or week 24
(cohort 2).
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of each cohort and treatment
assignment are presented as mean (standard deviation) or
proportion where appropriate. Changes in weight, WC and
adiposity indices were assessed between baseline and week
12 (cohort 1) or week 24 (cohort 2). For each cohort, data
from patients in the EMPA 10mg and EMPA 25mg groups
were pooled. These changes from baseline were analysed
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline
HbA1c and the baseline value of the adiposity measure as
linear covariables, and baseline estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate [eGFR by modification of diet in renal disease
(MDRD)], region and treatment as fixed effects. The num-
ber of antihypertensive medications at baseline was an
additional fixed effect in the analysis of cohort 1, and the
individual study was an additional fixed effect in the analy-
sis of cohort 2. Analyses were conducted on the full-analy-
sis set; for cohort 1, this was defined as randomized patients
who received at least one dose of study drug and had base-
line HbA1c and mean 24-h systolic blood pressure values.
For cohort 2, this was defined as randomized patients who
received at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline
HbA1c value. Values observed after initiation of additional
anti-hyperglycaemic rescue therapy were set to missing. A
last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was
used to impute missing data. Since impact on treatment
effects for body weight and visceral adiposity markers are
generally perceived to be greater in certain subpopulations,
we also stratified effects of EMPA by age (<50, 50­64,
65­74 and 75
years), sex and degree of abdominal obe-
sity at baseline (WC<88, 88­102 and >102cm) and com-
pared changes with placebo using adjusted means by
ANCOVA with interaction testing of treatment by strata.
For all statistical testing, a two-sided p-value<0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS
Corporation, Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline characteristics of the two study cohorts by treat-
ment assignment are shown in Table 1. The adjusted mean
[standard error (SE)] HbA1c change from baseline at week
12 in cohort 1 was 0.03% (0.04%) with placebo compared
with -0.61% (0.02%) with EMPA [adjusted mean (95%
confidence interval (CI) difference versus placebo: -0.64%
(-0.72% to -0.55%), p<0.001]. In cohort 2, the adjusted
mean (SE) HbA1c change from baseline at week 24 was
-0.08% (0.03%) with placebo compared with -0.73%
(0.02%) with EMPA [adjusted mean (95% CI) difference
versus placebo: -0.65% (-0.71% to -0.59%), p<0.001].
There were significantly greater reductions in body
weight, WC and most but not all indices of adiposity in the
EMPA-treated groups compared with placebo in both
study cohorts (Figure 1(a) to (d)). The adjusted mean (95%
CI) difference in body weight with EMPA versus placebo
was -1.7kg (-2.1 to -1.4kg) in cohort 1 and -1.9kg (-2.1
to -1.7kg) in cohort 2 (p<0.001 for both). The adjusted
mean (95% CI) difference in WC with EMPA versus pla-
cebo was -1.3cm (-1.8 to -0.7cm) in cohort 1 and -1.3cm
(-1.7 to -1.0
cm) in cohort 2 (p<
0.001 for both). There
was no difference in eTBF in cohort 1 for EMPAcompared
with placebo: adjusted mean difference -0.2% (-0.7% to
0.3%; p=0.45), but in cohort 2, there was a trend towards
greater reduction in eTBF for EMPA versus placebo:
-0.3% (-0.7% to 0.0%; p=0.08). The adjusted mean (95%
CI) difference in ICO with EMPA versus placebo was
-0.007 (-0.011 to -0.004) in cohort 1 and -0.008 (-0.010
to -0.006) in cohort 2 (p<0.001 for both). For VAI, there
was a trend for greater adjusted mean (95% CI) difference
with EMPA versus placebo was -0.3 (-0.5 to 0.0; p=0.07)
in cohort 1, and a statistically greater reduction of -0.4
(-0.7 to -0.1; p=0.003) in cohort 2.
EMPA reduced weight, WC and indices of adiposity
when stratified by age (<50, 50­64, 65­74 and 75years;
Table 2), sex (Table 3) and degree of abdominal obesity at
baseline (WC<88, 88­102, >102cm; Table 4), albeit of
greater magnitude with advanced age and with more severe
abdominal obesity. Statistically significant interactions
were seen with the effect of EMPA by age on weight
(p-interaction=0.028), WC (p-interaction=0.010) and
ICO (p-interaction
=
0.010) and by degree of abdominal
obesity on weight (p-interaction
=
0.002) in cohort 2.
Results stratified by age, sex and degree of abdominal obe-
sity in cohort 1 were directionally consistent with those
seen in cohort 2 (Supplemental Tables S1 to S3).
Discussion
In this study, we found that among 3300 patients with
T2DM enrolled in five clinical trials, EMPA compared
with placebo significantly reduced body weight, WC and
multiple indices of overall and of visceral adiposity in
patients with T2DM. Reductions in adiposity markers with
EMPA were generally seen across all subgroups of age,
sex and degree of abdominal obesity, with statistically sig-
nificant heterogeneity of effects observed such that the
effects of EMPA on reductions in body weight, WC and
ICO were greater with increasing age; and reductions in
body weight were greater with more severe abdominal
obesity in those patients treated for 24
weeks. There was
no heterogeneity of the effects of EMPA on body weight,
WC or indices of visceral adiposity by sex. These results
suggest that treatment with EMPA may reduce VAT and
lead to changes in body composition associated with
improved cardiometabolic risk profiles. Given that VAT is
122 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 13(2)
strongly associated with increased risk of T2DM, athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and cardiac
function, if any degree of that association is causal, our
findings could have potentially important clinical implica-
tions for the prevention and treatment of visceral adipos-
ity-related cardiometabolic complications and warrant
further investigation. Furthermore, in the context of previ-
ous studies directly measuring changes in VAT, these
results suggest that WC and the indices of ICO and VAI
might be useful for research and for clinical purposes as a
surrogate for VAT. Further studies directly comparing
these indices of adiposity with gold standard imaging
assessments of VAT and other adipose depots are currently
underway.13
Dedicated imaging sub-studies in clinical trials of
SGLT-2 have demonstrated improvements in total fat mass
and size of abdominal fat depots. In a 2-year study of EMPA
versus glimepiride, total fat mass (by dual x-ray absorptiom-
etry) and visceral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tis-
sue (SAT) volumes (by MRI) were significantly decreased
among those treated with EMPA versus glimepiride.12
Similar findings were seen in trials of canagliflozin versus
glimepiride21 and dapagliflozin versus placebo.22 The find-
ings of these three dedicated imaging sub-studies align well
with other results of weight reducing interventions3 and
have been recently summarized.23 Our results here extend
these observations to more clinically applicable indices of
visceral adiposity that can be simply applied in the clinical
setting and followed through treatment.
In contrast to prior dedicated body composition studies
that measured total body fat directly with imaging, we did
not observe a statistically significant reduction in eTBF
with EMPA treatment using the referenced formula. This
discrepancy could be due to the fact that the eTBF formula
used in this study may be too imprecise to accurately quan-
tify smaller relative changes in total body fat or may not be
accurately calibrated for the trial population. However, in
light of the presence of a trend towards a reduction in total
body fat using the estimating equation in addition to prior
evidence of a positive effect of EMPA and other drugs in
this class on reducing body fat, the reduction of visceral
and abdominal subcutaneous fat could have potential
important clinical implications for cardiovascular and met-
abolic risk reduction.

multiple published, validated indices. Several limitations
also merit comment. First, although VAT is strongly associ-
ated with cardiometabolic disease and adverse outcomes,
this study cannot demonstrate whether reduction in VAT
with EMPA contributes to altered glycometabolic, ASCVD
or heart failure risk. Second, with the large majority of
study participants being Caucasian, our findings may not
be generalizable to African-American patients who are
more likely to have a lower visceral fat burden compared
with other races even at higher BMIs or other racial minori-
ties not represented or underrepresented in the present
series of trials. Third, other anthropomorphic and imaging
markers of VAT were not assessed in this study, so we are
unable to comment on their relation with EMPA treatment.
Fourth, although the use of an LOCF approach to impute
missing data may lead to bias in the estimation of treatment
effects and greater type 1 error, when we examined the
similarity between LOCF and a mixed-effect model
repeated measure approach in the individual trials, results
were generally consistent.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EMPA
compared with placebo significantly reduced body
weight, WC and indices of total and visceral adiposity in
3300 patients with T2DM. Whether changes in body
composition induced by EMPA will be associated with
reduced ASCVD and heart failure risk remains to be
determined. The recently reported EMPA-REG
OUTCOMETM trial (NCT01131676)24 assessing cardio-
vascular safety of EMPA versus placebo in a high-cardi-
ovascular risk patient population provides further insight
into this important clinical question and will help define
the role of EMPA in the prevention and treatment of obe-
sity and T2DM.
