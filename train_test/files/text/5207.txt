Abstract: Sociometer theory proposes that self-esteem is an adaptation which evolved to
monitor and regulate interpersonal relationships. It is therefore sensitive to self-assessments
in domains relevant to relational desirability. Positive relationships between self-perceived
physical attractiveness and self-esteem found in previous studies may reflect the
functioning of a mating sociometer, designed to monitor individuals' desirability as
romantic or sexual partners. We thus predicted that these relationships should be mediated
by self-perceptions of romantic desirability, or more specifically, individuals' confidence in
their abilities to successfully establish and maintain romantic relationships. Two hundred
and eighty seven young adults (98 male) completed an online measure of self-perceived
attractiveness, together with measures of self-confidence in appearance and romantic
relationships, body-esteem and global self-esteem. Linear regression analyses indicated that
self-perceived attractiveness, self-confidence in appearance and body-esteem all
significantly predicted self-esteem, and that in each case, the relationship was mediated by
romantic self-confidence. Self-perceived attractiveness predicted self-esteem significantly
more strongly in females than in males. We discuss these results in relation to sociometer
and parental investment theories, and explore limitations and future directions.

Introduction
Self-esteem is one of the most widely studied constructs in social and personality
psychology and has been of interest to the discipline from its very conception. However, it
was only relatively recently that psychologists have turned their attention to evolutionary
functional explanations of self-esteem. Following early theories of self-esteem, which
linked it to feelings of dominance or superiority over others (Mead, 1934/1967; Maslow,
1937), such explanations have focused on the potential adaptive benefits of self-evaluation

in terms of monitoring individuals' status in intra-group competition for dominance,
resources and mates (Alexander, 1980; Barkow, 1989). One of the most influential current
theories, sociometer theory (Leary and Baumeister, 2000; Leary, Tambor, Terdal, and
Downs, 1995), extends this perspective, proposing that self-esteem functions as an
interpersonal monitor of the extent to which an individual is valued or devalued by others
as a relational partner. It thus monitors the individual's eligibility for lasting, desirable
social relationships. The sociometer is also concerned with motivating people to maintain a
minimum level of acceptance from others.
Sociometer theory (Leary and Baumeister, 2000) has been supported by a range of
experimental and questionnaire evidence. Self-esteem responded to a number of social
inclusion or exclusion manipulations: For example, participants who are led to believe that
they have been rejected by others experience a drop in self-esteem (Kavanagh, Robins, and
Ellis, 2010; Leary, Haupt, Strausser, and Chokel, 1998). People who reported having
higher-quality interpersonal relationships also reported higher levels of self-esteem,
aggregate levels of self-esteem in citizens of different countries were positively correlated
with the degree of close social interaction characteristic of individuals within those
societies (Denissen, Penke, Schmitt, and van Aken, 2008), and people's scores on a variety
of measures of self-esteem were positively related to their expectations of being positively
evaluated by others (Back et al., 2009).
According to sociometer theory, self-esteem not only assesses and responds to the
quality and quantity of an individual's actual relationships, but also monitors their
eligibility for various potential relationships. Leary and Baumeister (2000) presented
evidence suggesting that self-esteem is strongly linked to individuals' self-assessments in
domains relevant to interpersonal attractiveness. Most modern treatments of self-esteem
regard it as a multidimensional or hierarchical construct (Fleming and Courtney, 1984),
made up of self-evaluations in a number of different domains, and a more global
assessment of self-worth. For example, an individual may have high self-esteem with
respect to academic abilities, whilst having low self-esteem regarding athletic abilities. As
predicted by sociometer theory, many established dimensions of self-esteem are concerned
with attributes which are especially important in establishing and maintaining social
relationships. Most measures of self-esteem include subscales assessing participants'
perceptions of their likeability or social skills, physical appearance, and competence in
socially-valued domains such as academic performance or public speaking (Blascovich and
Tomaka, 1991). People's self-assessments on these dimensions strongly predict their
overall levels of self-esteem (Pelham and Swann, 1989). Thus, global self-esteem is
derived from perceptions of qualities in specific domains that are valued by others.
Evolutionary psychologists have elaborated on the notion that self-esteem is an
adaptive mechanism designed to monitor relational status and eligibility. In particular,
Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2004) argued that social inclusion is not a single adaptive problem,
but rather represents a loose collection of numerous more specific challenges. Since the
characteristics of various types of relationships differ, different attributes may be required
to establish and maintain them. For example, physical attractiveness may be an especially
important asset when trying to attract a mate, but is less important in maintaining
relationships with family members or colleagues. Just as self-esteem subsumes a number of
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem

domains, so too does social inclusion involve a variety of social relationships, each with its
own adaptive challenges. Thus the structure of self-esteem may reflect the diversity of
social relationships that it has evolved to monitor and maintain, and there may be multiple
sociometers, each responding to information relevant to a particular type of relationship
(Kirkpatrick and Ellis, 2004). Furthermore, since various types of social relationships are
likely to be of differential importance to specific individuals, we might expect individual
differences in the strength of association between specific self-perceptions and self-esteem.
Support for this contention comes from a series of studies showing that people's social
roles mediated the relationship between specific self-perceptions and self-esteem (Anthony,
Holmes, and Wood, 2007). People with more interdependent social roles had stronger
associations between self-esteem and self-perceived communal qualities, such as kindness
and supportiveness, than did those with more independent social roles.
The perspective of multiple, domain-specific sociometers (Kirkpatrick and Ellis,
2004), leads us to expect a distinct mechanism that is designed to monitor mating
relationship status (i.e., a mating sociometer), given that successfully securing mates is a
primary adaptive challenge. If the outcome of this monitoring process is negative, the
sociometer should react by causing self-esteem to drop. This is supported by studies
showing that romantic rejection strongly undermines self-esteem (Baumeister, Wotman,
and Stillwell, 1993). Conversely, higher satisfaction with romantic relationships (Hendrick,
Hendrick, and Adler, 1988) and perceptions of the commitment of romantic partners (Rill,
Baiocchi, Hopper, Denker, and Olson, 2009) are associated with higher levels of self-
esteem. Since the sociometer is also thought to be responsible for monitoring an
individual's eligibility for mating relationships (Leary and Baumeister, 2000), self-esteem
should reflect self-assessment of desirability as a mate. This was found in two studies
involving overall self-esteem and measures of mate value (Brase and Guy, 2004; Penke and
Dennisen, 2008).
A further study (Pass, Lindenberg, and Park, 2010, Study 1) provided additional
evidence that self-esteem is especially sensitive to people's self-perceptions of their
desirability as a mate. Participants of both sexes completed fake personality inventories and
were then provided with false feedback relating to their capacity as a mating or friendship
partner, which was ostensibly based on their responses. Those who received negative
feedback about their capacity as a mate reported lower subsequent self-esteem than those
who had received negative feedback about their friendship-capacity, and lower than
controls who received no feedback. These findings suggest that since mating relationships
are of particular evolutionary importance, assessments of eligibility for such relationships
may have especially strong effects on levels of self-esteem.
One variable which has been widely studied in relation to self-esteem, and which
has clear implications for romantic desirability, is self-perceived physical attractiveness. A
meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between these variables found a moderate
overall positive correlation (r = .32) between self-rated attractiveness and self-esteem
(Feingold, 1992), and that this was significantly stronger for women (r = .32) than for men
(r = .27). The traditional social science explanation for this sex difference is that it may
reflect cultural values that emphasize women's physical attractiveness over men's (e.g.,
Mathes and Kahn, 1975). An evolutionary sociometer perspective would hold that since
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -71-
physical attractiveness contributes more to mate value in women than in men (Buss, 1989),
women's self-esteem should be more strongly related to their self-perceived attractiveness
than is men's. In a variety of cultures, male mate value has been shown to be more strongly
related to attributes that reflect access to resources, such as social status, intelligence, and
industriousness (Buss, 1989). This is also supported by evidence that self-esteem correlates
more strongly with socioeconomic status in men than in women (Twenge and Campbell,
2002).
Experimental evidence also supports the view that self-esteem responds to
individuals' perceptions of their market value and that men and women respond to different
cues to mate value. Pass et al. (2010, study 2) provided participants with false feedback that
they were likely to be repeatedly rejected by potential romantic partners. Half were
informed that this was due to their physical attractiveness, and half that it was a result of
their lack of competence and status. Women in the attractiveness manipulation condition
subsequently reported lower self-esteem than women in both the status manipulation and a
control condition with no feedback. Men in the status manipulation condition reported
lower levels of self-esteem than those in the other two conditions.
Thus the mating sociometer perspective predicts that individuals' self-assessments
in domains relevant to mate value influence their self-esteem because these attributes affect
their ability to form and maintain relationships with mates. The relationship between self-
perceived attractiveness and self-esteem should be mediated by individuals' assessments of
their desirability, and specifically, their confidence in their ability to form and maintain
romantic relationships. We sought to investigate this by examining relationships between
self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, romantic self-confidence and self-esteem in
a sample of young adults. In doing so we employed a novel social comparison measure of
self-perceived facial attractiveness.
Facial attractiveness forms only one component of overall physical attractiveness.
Judges' ratings of physical attractiveness are strongly influenced by waist-to-hip ratio
(Singh, 1993; Singh, Dixson, Jessop, Morgan, and Dixson, 2010) and body mass index
(Tovée, Hancock, Mahmoodi, Singleton, and Cornelissen, 2002; Cornelissen, Tovée, and
Bateson, 2009) in women, and height (Sear, 2006) and waist-to-chest ratio (Swami and
Tovée, 2005; Swami et al., 2007) in men. We thus examined whether participants' feelings
about their bodily attractiveness were also related to their levels of self-esteem. Although
previous studies have demonstrated positive correlations between body-esteem (a measure
of individuals' self-perceived bodily attractiveness) and self-esteem (Franzoi and Shields,
1984; Wade and Cooper, 1999; Wade, 2000), we sought to investigate whether this
relationship is partly mediated by individuals' romantic self-confidence.
Thus the present study measured self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness,
appearance and romantic self-confidence, and self-esteem in a sample of young adults. We
predicted that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, and self-confidence regarding
appearance, would be significantly related to self-esteem in both sexes and that these
relationships would be stronger in women than in men, and partially mediated by romantic
self-confidence.

Materials and Methods
Participants
There were 98 men and 189 women, aged from 18 to 35 (M = 21.5, SD = 3.64) and
recruited via emails inviting students at two universities in the north of England to
participate in a study on self-perceptions, who took part online. Since the study allowed
participants to complete only some of the measures, separate sample sizes for each variable
are reported in the Results section.
Measures
The study consisted of a web-based questionnaire which asked participants to
complete a number of scales in the order shown below. The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the University of Central Lancashire School of Psychology.
Self-esteem. Rosenberg's (1965) 10-item Self-Esteem Scale (SES) was used to
measure global self-esteem. This measure asks participants to indicate their feelings
towards self-descriptive statements (e.g., "I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an
equal basis with others," "At times I think I am no good at all") on four-point scales
ranging from 1 ("strongly agree") to 4 ("strongly disagree"). This is the most widely used
measure of self-esteem. Fleming and Courtney (1984) reported a Cronbach's alpha of .88,
and the scale demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency in the present sample ( =
.90).
Self-perceived facial attractiveness was measured by asking participants to compare
their level of attractiveness to 25 male and 25 female images. For ethical reasons, the
comparison images were composites rather than real individuals. Comparison stimuli were
constructed for each sex by digitally combining 50 color JPEG images of faces which had
been rated for attractiveness as part of a previous study: 25 male or female face stimuli
were generated such that the two lowest-rated images were combined, then the next two
lowest, proceeding in that fashion up to the two highest-rated pictures. This method was
employed to try to ensure that there would be sufficient variance in the attractiveness of the
stimuli to which participants would compare themselves. The composite-face stimuli were
then rated for attractiveness, on 7-point Likert scales, by 64 undergraduate psychology
students, as part of an unrelated study. The mean ratings for the stimuli ranged from .88 to
4.22 for the female and from 1.00 to 3.61 for the male faces.
For the same-sex images, participants were asked to "Please compare your own face
to the faces below for attractiveness." For the opposite-sex images, participants were
instructed: "In the next set of ratings you will see photos of the opposite-sex. When judging
your face against theirs consider whether you think they would consider you as a potential
partner." Participants compared themselves to each image on a seven-point scale where 1
corresponded to "my face is much less attractive," 4 to "same," and 7 to "my face is much
more attractive." The order of presentation of images within the male and female sets was
randomized for each participant.
Responses were scored in the following manner. Since ratings of 4 corresponded to
equally attractive, these received a score equal to the mean attractiveness rating of the
image presented. Ratings of 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to degrees of much less attractive and
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -73-
thus received scores equal to the mean rating for the face presented, minus 3, 2, and 1,
respectively. Conversely, ratings of 5, 6, and 7 corresponded to degrees of much more
attractive and thus receive scores equal to the mean rating for the face presented, plus 1, 2,
or 3, respectively. Thus the formula for scoring the test was:
Item score = mean attractiveness rating for image + (participant's response ­ 4)
and total test scores were the sum of the scores for all of the items.
Since participants' comparison scores on the male and female image tests were
strongly positively correlated (r = .81, p < .05, N = 246), they were combined to produce a
single facial attractiveness score for each participant. Cronbach's alpha for the combined
scale was .98, and previous research had demonstrated that scores on the measure
correlated moderately but significantly (r = .67, p < .05) with a widely used single-item
measure of self-perceived facial attractiveness (Bale, 2004).
Self-perceived bodily attractiveness was measured using the 35-item Body Esteem
Scale (BES: Franzoi and Shields, 1984). This widely-used instrument measures
participants' global attitudes towards their bodies and also includes sex-specific subscales.
For women, these measure sexual attractiveness, weight concern, and physical condition.
For men, they measure physical attractiveness, upper body strength, and physical condition.
The test consists of a list of body parts (e.g., "legs," "nose") and physical attributes (e.g.,
"energy level," "physical coordination"), and participants indicate their feelings towards
each of them on a scale of 1 to 5 corresponding to "have strong negative feelings" and
"have strong positive feelings," respectively. Franzoi and Shields (1984) reported
Cronbach's alphas for the scale ranging between .78 and .87; in the present sample,  = .92.
Self-confidence was measured using the 54-item Personal Evaluation Inventory
(PEI: Shrauger and Schohn, 1995). Participants are asked to indicate their feelings towards
self-descriptive statements on four-point scales ranging from 1 ("strongly agree") to 4
("strongly disagree"), and responses are scored such that higher scores represent greater
self-confidence. Our analyses focused on participants' scores on the Appearance and
Romantic sub-scales of the measure, which each consist of seven items. Examples of the
first included: (1) "I am better looking than the average person" and (2) "Most people
would probably consider me physically unattractive." Examples of the second are: (1) "I
have no difficulty maintaining a satisfying romantic relationship" and (2) "I have more
trouble establishing a romantic relationship than most people do." Blascovitch and Tomaka
(1991) reported Cronbach's alpha values for the subscales ranging between .67 and .89; in
the present sample,  = .87 and .83 for the Appearance and Romantic subscales,
respectively.

As expected, all variables were significantly positively related. Given that self-
perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, and self-confidence in appearance, were
significantly positively related, we created a measure of overall attractiveness by
calculating the mean of the standardized scores on these measures for each participant. In
order to examine whether self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-confidence in
appearance, and overall attractiveness each significantly predicted global self-esteem in
both sexes, we conducted a series of linear regression analyses. Following procedures
initially described by Baron and Kenny (1986), we also conducted mediational analyses to
examine whether the effects of these predictors on self-esteem were partially mediated by
romantic self-confidence. Figures 1 to 4 show the results of these analyses.

It can be seen that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-confidence in
appearance, and overall attractiveness each significantly predicted self-esteem. In order to
assess whether these relationships were significantly mediated by romantic self-confidence,
we followed statistical bootstrapping procedures outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2004),
employing their SOBEL script for PASW 18, which calculates mediational effect sizes
based on the product of the unstandardized regression coefficients between the predictor
and mediator, and mediator and criterion (referred to as ab), and reports confidence
intervals for this based on bootstrap samples. These analyses indicated hypothesized small
but significant mediational effects of romantic self-confidence on the relationship between
self-perceived facial attractiveness and global self-esteem (ab = .015, 99% CI [.006, .028])
and bodily attractiveness and global self-esteem (ab = .024, 99% CI [.008, .042]), and
significant medium mediational effects of romantic self-confidence on the relationship
between self-confidence in appearance and global self-esteem (ab = .102, 99% CI [.010,
.206]) and overall attractiveness and self-esteem (ab = .390, 95% CI [.014, .753]) (see
Kenny, 2011, for recommendations on how to interpret the magnitude of mediation effect
size estimates).
In order to examine whether self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness, self-
confidence in appearance, and the aggregate measure of overall attractiveness significantly
predicted self-esteem separately in each sex, we conducted a series of linear regression
analyses. In order to examine whether there were any sex differences in the strength of
these predictors, we dummy coded sex and calculated an interaction term between this
variable and each predictor. Table 3 shows the results of these analyses.

In both men and women, as predicted, self-perceived facial and bodily
attractiveness self-confidence in appearance, and overall attractiveness all significantly
predicted global self-esteem. Analyses of the interaction terms indicate that, as predicted,
the relationship between self-perceived facial attractiveness, and the overall measure of
attractiveness and self-esteem is significantly stronger in women than in men. Although the
relationship between self-confidence in appearance and self-esteem also appeared to be
stronger in women, this sex difference was only marginally significant (p < .10). Contrary
to our hypothesis, the relationship between self-perceived bodily attractiveness and self-
esteem appears to be stronger in men than in women, although this difference was not
significant (p = .37).
Discussion
We found that self-perceived facial and bodily attractiveness and self-confidence in
appearance all significantly predicted self-esteem in both sexes, and in each case, these
relationships were partially mediated by participants' romantic self-confidence. This
suggests that correlations between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem found in
previous studies (Feingold, 1992), and here, can be explained in terms of sociometer
theory, which predicts that self-esteem is sensitive to self-perceptions in domains relevant
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -78-
to relational desirability. Our mediational analyses suggest that self-perceived
attractiveness may influence self-perceived romantic desirability, which in turn may
influence self-esteem (although given the correlational design of our study, we must be
cautious about inferring such causal relationships). It is important to note that romantic
self-confidence only partially mediated the relationships between measures of self-
perceived attractiveness and self-esteem, and that the mediation effects were substantially
smaller than the direct effect of each predictor, indicating that there are additional, stronger
direct relationships between the attractiveness measures and self-esteem. Given that greater
physical attractiveness is also associated with more positive friendship, professional and
even familial relationships (Langlois et al., 2000), these results are still consistent with a
sociometer perspective.
We obtained more mixed results with respect to sex differences in the associations
between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem. Although facial attractiveness and
composite overall attractiveness were both more strongly related to self-esteem in women
than in men, confidence in appearance was only marginally so, and no sex difference was
found for bodily attractiveness. It should be noted that bodily attractiveness measures traits
relevant to physical condition and strength which, whilst predicting physical attractiveness
in men (Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Swami and Tovée, 2005; Swami et al., 2007) may
also be related to dominance, social status and other variables relevant to parental
investment (Sell et al., 2009). Moreover, athletic ability, which should relate to men's
assessments of their bodies, is thought to be important in male intrasexual competition for
mates (Faurie, Pontier, and Raymond, 2004; Farrelly and Nettle, 2007; Schulte-Hostedde,
Eys, and Johnson, 2008). Thus, whilst theory predicts that physical attractiveness, by virtue
of signaling reproductive potential, should be more important for female romantic
desirability (Buss, 1989), by additionally signaling cues to traits relevant to competitive
ability in males, these aspects of bodily attractiveness are likely to be important for self-
esteem in men.
The absence of sex differences in two of the relationships between specific
attractiveness measures and self-esteem may also be partially due to the demographic
profile of our sample, which consisted largely of young undergraduate students. The
importance of traits relevant to parental investment, such as social status and economic
resources, may be attenuated in men of this age group, relative to older men. In their
absence, bodily attractiveness may be a more important component of men's romantic
desirability, thus explaining the relative lack of a clear sex difference in this case. This
possibility could be investigated by examining whether the relationship between self-
perceived attractiveness (particularly bodily attractiveness) and self-esteem is lessened in
older men. Similarly, future studies could profitably examine sex differences in
relationships between self-esteem and other aspects of mate value, particularly those
relevant to parental investment such as wealth and social status.
Although our results broadly support a sociometer perspective on the relationship
between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem, there are several potential limitations
to our study. In addition to the usual limitation of being unable to make causal inferences
based on cross sectional studies, another limitation is related to the construct of self-
perceived romantic desirability, and our operationalization of this as romantic self-
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem

confidence, measured by the PEI. The decision to use this measure was based on the
reasoning that a functional sociometer perspective would predict that self-perceived
attractiveness correlates with self-esteem because physical attractiveness is an attribute
important for the ability to form and maintain romantic relationships. Thus we predicted
that individuals' romantic self-confidence, which concerns their self-evaluations of this
ability, should mediate the link between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem.
Although the PEI measure of romantic self-confidence has excellent psychometric
properties (Shrauger and Schohn, 1995), it has not been as widely used as other measures
such as the Self-Perceived Mating Success Scale (SPMSS; Landolt, Lalumière, and
Quinsey, 1995). This focuses on people's perceptions of how much positive attention they
receive from members of the opposite sex, and their access to sexual partners. Although
these perceptions are likely to influence confidence in the ability to form and maintain
romantic relationships, we considered that the PEI provided a more direct measure of
romantic self-confidence. A further consideration is that items on the SPMSS are primarily
relevant to short-term relationships. The mating sociometer perspective predicts that self-
esteem should be sensitive not only to desirability as a short-term partner but also to
confidence in the ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships, especially for
women. Given that the PEI includes items relevant to both short- and long-term
relationships, it therefore provided a more comprehensive measure of self-perceived
romantic desirability in the present context.
Another potential limitation concerns our interpretation of sociometer theory,
specifically the prediction that individuals' confidence in their ability to form and maintain
romantic relationships should mediate the relationship between self-perceived
attractiveness and self-esteem. An alternative possibility is that specific self-perceptions
directly influence self-esteem, rather than the relationship being mediated by conscious
appraisals of the significance of level of physical attractiveness for individuals' romantic
relationships. On this view, self-esteem would simply be an affective "gut reaction" based
on the extent to which others value the individual as a relational partner. Leary (2004)
suggested that the sociometer system may have evolved from more primitive, purely
affective systems designed to monitor dominance-submission and inclusion-exclusion
relationships in the immediate social context. He went on to argue that the emergence of
the conceptual self in humans created a more complex sociometer system which integrated
individuals' immediate, non-conscious affective reactions to social feedback with longer-
term cognitive appraisals of their abilities and relational value. We suggest that the direct
relationship between self-perceived attractiveness and self-esteem found in the present
study largely reflects the non-conscious, affective response of the sociometer system to
individuals' everyday experiences of interactions with others, which are likely to be
influenced by their appearance. The mediational effect of romantic self-confidence may
reflect conscious appraisals of the implications of the level of attractiveness for the
person's ability to form and maintain romantic relationships. According to this analysis,
had we found no mediational effect of romantic self-confidence, we would not necessarily
reject a sociometer account of the relationship between self-perceived attractiveness and
self-esteem, but perhaps instead conclude that conscious appraisals of the implications of
attractiveness for romantic relationships do not influence this.

This discussion relates to wider issues surrounding the conceptualization and
measurement of components of the self and self-esteem. Theories and measures of self-
esteem have traditionally placed different degrees of emphasis on self-evaluations of
competence, skills or abilities, and a more affective, global sense of self-worth (Wells and
Marwell, 1976). Different theoretical models of self-esteem have disagreed about whether
these are truly distinct but related constructs, or are aspects of the same construct. Although
this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper, our analysis does assume that self-
confidence is distinct from self-esteem. Consistent with this, Shrauger and Schohn (1995)
found that scores on a measure of romantic self-confidence were independent of those on
Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale, a global measure of self-worth. We therefore
consider that including these two measures in the current study provided a valid means of
investigating whether romantic self-confidence mediates the relationship between self-
perceived attractiveness and self-worth. Although we interpreted the significant positive
relationship between these measures in terms of a sociometer perspective whereby
romantic self-confidence predicts self-esteem, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
correlation reflects an overlap between instruments which are measuring similar constructs.
It is important to note that our mediational analyses assumed that specific self-
evaluations causally affect self-esteem. Sociometer theory suggests that this reflects the
adaptive function of self-esteem, which evolved to monitor individuals' relational status
together with traits relevant to this (Leary and Baumeister, 2000). However, given that the
correlational design of this and almost every previous study in this area (e.g., Feingold,
1992) does not allow a definitive causal interpretation of the associations, we must seek
alternative evidence for these causal assumptions. Pass et al. (2010, study 2) did find that
women who were given negative false-feedback about their physical attractiveness
subsequently reported lower self-esteem than controls, suggesting that changes in self-
perceived physical attractiveness do have an immediate impact on self-esteem.
Alternative theories of self-esteem propose that self-worth causally affects specific
self-perceptions (Brown, Dutton, and Cook, 2001): Thus self-esteem would drive
perceptions of attractiveness, rather than the reverse, as assumed here. To our knowledge,
no previous research has examined whether experimentally manipulating individuals' self-
esteem affects their self-perceived attractiveness. To eliminate the possibility that this is the
case, further experimental research, which independently manipulates specific self-
perceptions (e.g., Pass et al, 2010) or self-esteem, is required in order to examine their
possible effects on each other. Similarly, longitudinal diary studies examining whether
changes in self-esteem are predicted by everyday changes in individuals' self-perceptions
in domains relevant to interpersonal relationships, and their experiences of interactions with
actual or potential romantic partners, would help to differentiate between these alternate
theories.
In addition, further research could profitably examine whether the kinds of
mediational relationships we discuss here also operate in the context of other, non-romantic
interpersonal relationships as would be suggested by a modular sociometer perspective
(Kirkpatrick and Ellis, 2004). For example, Srivastava and Beer (2005) investigated
relationships between individuals' attachment styles, self-evaluations and self-perceptions
of the regard of others for them, and others' actual liking of them, in a series of small group
A mating sociometer perspective of self esteem

interactions. They showed that, consistent with a sociometer perspective, being liked by
others lead to more positive self-evaluations, and this was moderated by individuals'
attachment anxiety. Further research of this kind investigating complex relationships
between constructs including self-perceptions and evaluations, self-esteem and individual
differences in interpersonally relevant variables (such as attachment style) in the context of
peer and family relationships would complement the present research and provide further
insight into the possible functioning of the sociometer.
If self-esteem is an evolutionary adaptation, we would expect it to functionally
influence individuals' interpersonal behavior. Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2004) suggested that
one of the ways in which the sociometer system might do this is by linking self-
assessments of relational value with adaptive choices about relational targets, through the
mediating influence of self-esteem. A study by Kavanagh et al. (2010) supports this
suggestion. Participants first received either accepting or rejecting feedback about their
desirability as a date from an attractive confederate of the opposite sex. This feedback was
found to influence how well-matched they felt they were with individuals of the opposite
sex who differed in mate value. Those who had received rejecting feedback rated
themselves as being more compatible with low mate-value targets, whereas those who had
received accepting feedback rated themselves as more compatible with high mate-value
targets. These effects were mediated by changes in self-esteem in response to acceptance or
rejection. Kavanagh et al. (2010) argued that this supported a sociometer view of the
function of self-esteem, in that participants were adaptively regulating their relational
aspirations in response to interpersonal feedback. Other than this, there is at present little
evidence that self-esteem causally affects relational behavior (Baumeister, Campbell,
Krueger, and Vohs, 2003). Thus future research could profitably examine whether self-
esteem adaptively guides relational behavior, as predicted by sociometer theory. In
particular, studies could examine whether self-esteem influences the use of specific mate
attraction (Buss, 1988a) and retention (Buss, 1988b) tactics. If self-esteem does influence
individuals' use of such tactics in adaptive ways, this would support the sociometer theory
view that self-esteem evolved to monitor and regulate interpersonal relationships.
