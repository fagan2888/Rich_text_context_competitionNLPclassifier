Sources of Prescription Opioid Pain Relievers
by Frequency of Past-Year Nonmedical Use:
United States, 2008-2011
The health consequences of nonmedical use of prescription
opioid pain relievers, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, are
significant.1 The commonly cited statistic that most nonmedi-
cal users obtain these medi-
cations from friends or fam-
ilyforfree2 oftenservesasthe
basis for interventions fo-
cused on patients. This statis-
tic, however, reflects sources
among all nonmedical users,
from those who used the drug once or twice to more frequent
users. Recent research indicates that frequent nonmedical us-
ers are increasing in numbers and differ from infrequent us-
ers with respect to high-risk behaviors.3,4 Little research has
examined whether the source of opioid medication differs by
frequency of nonmedical use. Such research can inform the
development of appropriately targeted interventions.
Methods | We obtained our data from the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual survey of the non-
institutionalized, civilian population 12 years or older that
provides estimates of substance use in the United States.2
We combined NSDUH public use files5 for the years 2008
through 2011 to improve the precision of estimates. Institu-
tional review board approval and informed consent were
not needed because this was a secondary analysis of data
from a public use file.
Respondents were asked about classes of drugs prone to
abuse. They were told that questions about pain relievers
applied to prescription opioids and selected barbiturate
combination products. Nonmedical use was defined as use
without a prescription or use with a prescription for the
feeling or the experience caused by the drug. Respondents
reported the frequency of nonmedical use, the type of opi-
oid pain reliever used, and the source of the opioid used
most recently.
We categorized the frequency of nonmedical use into the
following 4 groups: 1 to 29, 30 to 99, 100 to 199, and 200 to 365
days. This categorization has been used previously to exam-
inetrendsinthefrequencyofnonmedicaluseofpainrelievers.4
The sources of opioid pain relievers were categorized into the
following 6 groups: given by a friend or a relative for free, pre-
scribed by 1 or more physicians, stolen from a friend or a rela-
tive, bought from a friend or a relative, bought from a drug
dealer or other stranger, and other source. Average annual es-
timates for 2008 through 2011 were produced using propri-
etary software for interpretation of the survey results (SPSS
Complex Samples; IBM) to account for the NSDUH's sam-
pling methods and weighting. We used 2-tailed t tests for
statistical testing.
Results | We identified an average annual estimated 12 007 202
past-yearnonmedicalusers12yearsorolder;ofthese,11 018 735
(91.8%) reported a source of an opioid pain reliever. Most non-
medical users were men, and more than half had annual in-
comes of less than $50 000 (Table 1). Most nonmedical users
obtained opioid pain relievers from friends and relatives for
free (Table 2); however, the source varied significantly by fre-
quency of nonmedical use. Opioid pain relievers were ob-
tained from a friend or a relative for free with decreasing fre-
quency (from 61.9% to 26.4%) as the reported days of
nonmedical use increased from a range of 1 to 29 to a range of
200 to 365. Opioid pain relievers were obtained from other

than those with the lowest frequency of use to obtain opioids
from a physician's prescription or from a drug dealer. This pat-
tern is similar to that of patients in opioid treatment programs,
who cite dealers and physicians as frequent sources.6
These results underscore the need for interventions tar-
geting prescribing behaviors, in addition to those targeting
medication sharing, selling, and diversion. The essential steps
health care providers can take to curb this serious health prob-
lem include more judicious prescribing, use of prescription
drugÂ­monitoring programs, and screening patients for abuse
risk before prescribing opioids.

Blood Culture Use in the Emergency
Department in Patients Hospitalized
for Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Routine blood cultures for all patients hospitalized with
community-acquired pneumonia have limited utility, and
false-positive results lead to inappropriate antimicrobial use
and longer hospital stays.1
As a result, performance
measures and prac tice
guidelines that promoted
obtaining blood cultures in all such patients were modified
from 2005 through 2007 to recommend routine collection in
only the sickest patients.1,2 Using a national sample of emer-
gency department visits, we examined patterns of obtaining
cultures in adults hospitalized with community-acquired
pneumonia.
