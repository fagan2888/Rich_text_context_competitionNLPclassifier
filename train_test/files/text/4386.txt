Introduction
The immediate goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
treatment is to achieve sustained virological
response (SVR), but the ultimate aim of HCV
eradication is trying to improve long-term
outcomes (progression of fibrosis, clinical
decompensation and possibly death). Several
studies have demonstrated that in patients with
SVR after interferon-based treatment, liver fibro-
sis can regress during follow up.1,2 Moreover, in
those patients who achieve SVR, a decrease in
hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) can

Abstract
Background: We aimed to investigate the early changes in liver and spleen stiffness
measurement (LSM, SSM) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with compensated advanced
chronic liver disease (cACLD) treated with new antivirals (DAA) to elucidate factors
determining the initial change in stiffness and its implications for the long-term follow up of
HCV-cured patients.
Methods: A total of 41 patients with cACLD who started DAA therapy underwent LSM and
SSM at baseline, week 4, end of treatment (EOT), 24 and 48 weeks of follow up using transient
elastography.
Results: LSM improved rapidly during the first 4 weeks of treatment (baseline: 20.8kPa; week
4: 17.5kPa, p = 0.002), with no significant changes between week 4 and EOT (18.3kPa, p =
0.444) and between EOT and 48-week follow up (14.3kPa, p = 0.148). Likewise, SSM improved
rapidly (baseline: 45.7kPa; week 4: 33.8kPa, p = 0.047), with no significant changes between
week 4 and EOT (30.8kPa, p = 0.153) and between EOT and 48-week follow up (31.2kPa,
p = 0.317). A higher decrease in LSM was observed in patients with baseline ALT  twofold
upper limit normal (2 × ULN) than in those with ALT < 2 × ULN (­5.7kPa versus ­1.6kPa).
Patients who presented a decrease in LSM  10% during treatment compared with those with
LSM < 10% decrease, showed lower SSM values, higher platelet counts and lower bilirubin
levels at 24-week follow up. Those with decrease in SSM  10%, presented a higher increase
in platelets than those with SSM < 10% change (p = 0.015).
Conclusions: LSM and SSM decrease very rapidly during DAA treatment in cACLD patients
suggesting that it most probably reflects a reduction in inflammation rather than in fibrosis.
cACLD patients should be maintained under surveillance independently of stiffness changes,
because advanced fibrosis can still be present.

occur and, therefore, a decrease in complications
associated to portal hypertension is observed.3­5
A lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma6,7
and a reduction of all-cause mortality have also
been documented.8
Until 2014, interferon-based treatment was the
standard of care for HCV therapy. This treatment
was not free from complications, especially in
patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, in
whom low rates of SVR were observed.9­11
However, the introduction of new direct-acting
antiviral agents (DAA) in the current treatment
for HCV patients have changed this paradigm,
achieving high SVR rates with minimal side
effects, even in patients with cirrhosis.12 In conse-
quence, a huge number of patients with advanced
chronic liver disease are achieving SVR, high-
lighting the importance of monitoring fibrosis
regression to identify those patients with a higher
risk of developing complications during follow
up. Non-invasive methods such as transient elas-
tography (TE) may be useful for monitoring these
changes. Liver stiffness has been correlated with
degree of liver fibrosis, the presence of clinically
significant portal hypertension and with the risk
of decompensation.13­15 On the other hand,
recently, spleen stiffness has been shown to be
also correlated with HVPG and the risk of decom-
pensation.16,17 However, it has to be taken into
account that non-invasive methods to evaluate
liver fibrosis have not been validated in non-
viremic patients and changes in liver stiffness after
a successful antiviral treatment might not accu-
rately reflect a real change in residual fibrosis, but
rather a reduction in inflammation.
The aim of our study was to investigate the early
changes in liver and spleen stiffness measurement
(LSM, SSM) in HCV patients with compensated
advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) treated
with new oral DAA in order to elucidate the fac-
tors determining the initial changes in stiffness
and their implications for the long-term follow up
of HCV-cured patients.
Patients and methods
Consecutive compensated patients with baseline
LSM 10 kPa who met the Baveno VI criteria for
cACLD18 and in whom treatment with oral DAA
was approved were included in this prospective
small-scale study. As per definition, patients with
LSM 15 kPa were considered highly suggestive
of having cACLD and, for patients with LSM
between 10 and 15 kPa, one of the following cri-
teria was needed to confirm cACLD: platelet
count <150 × 109/l, spleen size 13 cm, nodular
liver or collateral circulation in abdominal ultra-
sound, HVPG >5 mmHg, upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy showing gastroesophageal varices or
previous liver biopsy showing bridging fibrosis or
cirrhosis. Patients with previous decompensation
were excluded. The recruitment period started in
January 2015 (date of the beginning of wide-
spread DAA therapy in Spain) and finished in
June 2015.
We calculated the sample size, taking into account
improvement in LSM [defined as a 10% decrease
in LSM from baseline to end of treatment (EOT)]
could be found in 60% of treated patients with a
total width of confidence interval (CI) of 30%
(45­75%), that is more than four times the back-
ground 10% improvement in untreated patients.
Aiming at a confidence level of 95%, a normal
approximation to the binomial calculation would
require a total sample size of 41 patients.19
The study [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT
02439567] was registered on 27 April 2015.
Patients received a treatment regimen adequate for
their HCV genotype. Patients with genotype 1 or 4
received treatment with Sofosbuvir 400 mg daily
(Sovaldi, Gilead, Cambridge, UK), Simeprevir
150 mg daily (Olysio, Jansen, Beerse, Belgium)
and weight-based dose of ribavirin (RBV) (with
ranging dose 800­1200 mg) for 12 weeks. For gen-
otype 3, patients received Sofosbuvir 400 mg daily,
Daclatasvir 60 mg daily (Daklinza, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Uxbridge, UK) and a weight-based dose
of RBV for 24 weeks. No other genotypes were
found in our sample.
All patients underwent LSM and SSM, and bio-
chemical tests at baseline, week 4, EOT and at 24
and 48 weeks of follow up after finishing treatment.
SVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 12
weeks follow up after finishing treatment. An
abdominal ultrasound was performed at baseline
and every 6 months, as part of standard routine
surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron (CEIC)
(JOA-SOF-2015-01) and was conducted in
accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki
M Pons, B Santos et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 621
and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All
patients gave written informed consent before the
inclusion.
Hepatitis C virus­ribonucleic acid quantification
Serum HCV-RNA was tested at baseline, during
treatment (weeks 4, 12 or 24) and 12 weeks after
treatment completion. A real-time polymerase
chain reaction-based test (Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas
TaqMan; Roche Molecular Diagnostics, West
Sussex, UK; detection limit 15 IU/ml) was used for
HCV detection and quantization. HCV genotyping
was performed by deep sequencing on a 454/
GS-Junior (Roche, Branford, CA, USA) platform.
Liver stiffness measurement
LSMs by TE (Fibroscan® 502 Touch, Echosens,
Paris, France) were performed by a single operator
with experience in more than 500 procedures (MP).
LSMs were performed in a fasting state according
to the usual standard procedure. Only LSMs with
success rate of 60% (with at least 10 valid meas-
urements) and an interquartile-range-to-median-
LSM ratio of 30% were selected as valid measures.
Medium or extra-large probes were selected as per
device indication and, for each patient, the same
probe was used during all study visits.
Spleen stiffness measurement
SSMs were performed with TE using Fibroscan®
502 Touch at the same appointment, with the
same probe and the same software used for LSM,
with the patient in the supine position and the left
arm in maximal abduction. The spleen was local-
ized under ultrasound assistance (Vscan®, General
Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA), and
the probe was positioned where the spleen was
correctly visualized. Reliable results for spleen stiff-
ness have not been yet validated. Therefore, the
same reliable criteria for the LSM were applied.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are expressed as numbers
(percentages) and continuous variables as median
(25th percentile­75th percentile). For statistical
analyses and presentation of results, differences
between categorical variables were assessed by
Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, when neces-
sary. Continuous variables were compared using
the Student's t test or Mann­Whitney test as
appropriate. Intragroup comparisons were made
using Wilcoxon's test for paired data. The general
linear model technique for analysing repeated
measures was used to examine changes in bio-
chemical parameters and TE over time. p values
below 0.05 were considered statistically significant
and, in paired-sample comparisons, the Bonferroni
correction was applied. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS v. 19.0 software (IBM,
Armonk, NY, US) and STATA 13.1 statistical
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, US).

patients were in Child-Pugh class A. Thirty-six
patients (87.8%) were infected by genotype 1, and
three patients (7.3%) were infected by genotype 4.
Two patients had genotype 3 (one of them with a
mixed genotype 1 and 3) and both were treated
with Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir + RBV for 24 weeks.
Seventeen patients (41.5%) presented with alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels higher than twofold
upper limit normal (2 × ULN) at baseline and
most of them were male (12 men versus 5 women).
Changes in laboratory parameters
At week 4, all patients presented with undetect-
able HCV-RNA. SVR was observed in 40
patients (97.6%). The patient who did not
achieve SVR relapsed after finishing treatment
and was HCV-genotype 1b.
Biochemical parameters improved rapidly after
starting treatment (Table 2), except for haemo-
globin and bilirubin that were altered during
treatment due to RBV, but returned to baseline
after finishing treatment.
Changes in liver and spleen stiffness during
treatment
Figure 1 shows changes in liver stiffness measure-
ments (LSM) and spleen stiffness measurements
(SSM) during the study period. All patients had
reliable LSM. Nine patients (22%) were not
included in pairwise comparisons of SSM. One of
them due to a previous splenectomy and the oth-
ers due to unreliable results at some study point.
For the patient who did not achieve SVR, LSM
and SSM were no longer performed after
finishing treatment. LSM and SSM for this
patient during treatment are represented in sup-
plementary Figure 1.
Globally, LSM during treatment improved.
Median LSM values were: 20.8 kPa (16.3­29.5
kPa) at baseline, 17.5 kPa (13.5­26.3 kPa) at
week 4 and 18.3 kPa (13.3­27.2 kPa) at the EOT
(p = 0.014). LSM improved rapidly and signifi-
cantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment (p =
0.002), with no significant changes between week
4 and EOT (p = 0.444). The median change from
baseline to week 4 was ­4.8 kPa (95% CI: ­6.4
kPa to ­1.0 kPa) and from baseline to EOT was
­3.3 kPa (95% CI: ­5.9 to ­0.5 kPa) (Figure 1A).
Significant changes in SSM were observed during
treatment. Median SSM was 45.7 kPa (26.6­65.2
kPa) at baseline, 33.8 kPa (26.3­46.4 kPa) at
week 4 and 30.8 kPa (21.3­39.1 kPa) at the EOT
(p = 0.012). Similarly to LSM, SSM improved
rapidly and significantly during the first 4 weeks
of therapy (p = 0.047), with no significant
changes between week 4 and EOT (p = 0.153).
The median change from baseline to week 4 was
­5.7 kPa (95% CI: ­11.4 kPa­0 kPa) and from
baseline to EOT ­6.6 kPa (95% CI: ­12.8 kPa to
­1.8 kPa) (Figure 1B).
Based on ALT levels, median basal LSM was
20.8 kPa in both groups (baseline ALT  2 ×
ULN and baseline ALT < 2 × ULN), however,
patients who had baseline ALT  2 × ULN pre-
sented a higher decrease in LSM during treat-
ment, median ­5.7 kPa (95% CI: ­9.7­0.2 kPa),
than patients with baseline ALT < 2 × ULN,
median ­1.6 kPa (95% CI: ­5.2­2.7 kPa) (p =
0.037) (Figure 2).

Changes in liver and spleen stiffness after
treatment
As shown in Figure 1A, during follow up, from
EOT to week 48, LSM continued improving,
especially until week 24, although this improve-
ment was not statistically significant (p = 0.148).
Median LSM at 24 weeks of follow up (24w-FU)
was 14.4 kPa (11.5­26.3 kPa) and at 48 weeks of
follow up (48w-FU) was 14.3 kPa (10.8­22.9
kPa). On the other hand, SSM remained stable
from EOT to 48w-FU (Figure 1B). Median SSM
was 32.3 kPa (21.5­46.4 kPa) at 24w-FU and
31.2 kPa (25.5­42.2 kPa) at 48w-FU. However,
both LSM and SSM decreased significantly from

baseline to end of follow up, with a median change
in LSM of ­5.5 kPa (­7.4 to -2.7 kPa, p = 0.023)
and median change in SSM of ­7.1 kPa (­9.6 to
-0.3 kPa, p = 0.038).
Figure 3 shows that the proportion of patients with
LSM >15 kPa decreased progressively from the
beginning of treatment until the end of follow up (p
= 0.003), while 24% of the study population had
their LSM reduced below the 10 kPa threshold.
Comparison of patient characteristics according
to change in liver and spleen stiffness
Patients who presented a decrease in LSM 
10% during treatment, calculated as (EOT LSM­
baseline LSM)/baseline LSM ×100, were consid-
ered to present a significant LSM improvement.
Twenty-three patients (57.5%) had a significant
LSM improvement. Differences between patients
with or without significant LSM improvement are
described in Table 3. As seen, patients with sig-
nificant LSM improvement showed lower SSM
values, higher platelet counts and lower bilirubin
levels at 24w-FU. In addition, those patients with
significant LSM improvement presented a higher
decrease in SSM during treatment (p = 0.027)
than patients without significant LSM improve-
ment (p = 0.870) (Figure 4).
Platelet count was also correlated with changes in
SSM. Patients with improvement in SSM  10%
(18 patients, 56.3%) from baseline to EOT, pre-
sented a higher increase in platelets, compared
with those who did not present an improvement
in SSM (p = 0.015) (Figure 5).
Liver stiffness measurement and spleen
stiffness measurement changes according to
surrogate markers of portal hypertension
Changes in LSM and SSM were also analysed in
patients with different degrees of portal hyperten-
sion. Since HVPG measurements were not availa-
ble and endoscopies were not performed in all
patients, platelet count (<150 × 109/l or 150 ×
109/l) and LSM (<20 kPa or 20 kPa) were used
as surrogate markers of portal hypertension. As seen
in supplementary Figure 2, patients with normal or
low platelets presented similar changes in LSM,
while significant LSM decrease was only observed
in patients with basal LSM  20 kPa. By contrast,
significant SSM changes were only observed in
patients with platelet counts < 150 × 109/l or LSM
 20 kPa, probably patients with higher basal portal
pressure. Patients with low (normal) SSM and
probablylowerportalpressureremainedunchanged.
Discussion
Treatment of HCV with the new DAA is
extremely effective, causing a very rapid control
of viral replication, normalization of transami-
nases and disappearance of liver inflammation.
Consequently, the virological and biochemical
profile of these new treatments is surely very dif-
ferent from the prior interferon-based therapies,
in which a slower and longer process was

probably taking place. This rapid on­off response
with DAA becomes a very interesting model for
investigating the dynamics of liver and spleen
stiffness and learn about the contribution of the
different components causing increased tissue
stiffness. The results of the present study clearly
indicate that liver and spleen stiffness improve
very early during treatment, as early as at 4 weeks
of therapy or even before, and more importantly,
that this initial decrease explains for most of the
final liver and spleen stiffness observed for the
first 48 weeks of post-treatment follow up.
Previous studies have shown improvement in
liver stiffness during long-term follow up, espe-
cially in patients who achieve SVR treated with

interferon-based therapies. Evaluation of LSM at
week 4 of treatment was rarely performed. Hézode
et al.20 studied patients treated with pegylated
interferon- plus RBV, and they found that
patients with cirrhosis who achieved SVR pre-
sented a median decrease in LSM of 4.1 kPa at
week 4 compared with a decrease of 0.7 kPa in
patients with no cirrhosis. By contrast, Bernuth
et al.21 found that in patients with chronic HCV
infection receiving sofosbuvir-based treatment,
LSM increased at week 4, from a baseline LSM
of 8 kPa to 12.9 kPa: one of the reasons given by
the authors to explain these results is that patients
did not fast prior to TE and also that the anaemia
caused by combined therapy might have increased
liver blood flow and liver stiffness.
One of the most remarkable findings of the pre-
sent study is that the rapid liver and spleen stiff-
ness improvement observed at 4 weeks of therapy
explains most of the decrease in stiffness observed
during the total 15 months of follow up. Indeed,
although there was a small decline in LSM from
week 4 to end of follow up (median change ­1.5
kPa), approximately 75% of the decrease was
observed during the first 4 weeks of therapy
(median change ­4.8 kPa). This observation,
together with the significant correlation between

high ALT at baseline and higher decrease in LSM
at 4 weeks, suggests that the main driver for the
liver stiffness improvement is suppression of liver
inflammation, as a consequence of viral eradica-
tion rather than a pure reduction of liver fibrosis.
This conclusion bears several implications. First,
that in patients with HCV cACLD, 15­20% of
the observed liver stiffness is probably due to
inflammation. In this regard, inflammation-
adapted LSM cut-offs have been proposed, but
there is a controversy about its usefulness.22,23
Second, this explains in great part the observed
discrepancies between liver histology and liver
stiffness after HCV eradication. As seen in our
patients, significant changes in LSM occur in 4
weeks, while it has been well documented that
detectable changes in fibrosis require much more
time. In our sample, 78% of our patients had
baseline LSM  15 kPa and at the end of follow
up, this percentage was reduced to 47%, while
the percentage of patients with LSM < 10 kPa
and with LSM between 10­15 kPa increased pro-
gressively. However, D'Ambrosio et al.24 demon-
strated that 21% of patients with LSM < 12 kPa
after an average of 61 months from SVR still had
cirrhosis in liver biopsy, indicating less accuracy
of TE for diagnosing cirrhosis in nonviremic
patients. Thus, in order to validate the clinical
meaning of post-treatment LSM values, longer
follow-up studies will be needed, taking into con-
sideration the information regarding basal LSM,
changes in LSM during follow up and post-ther-
apy time frames.
In addition to LSM improvement, SSM also
remarkably improved in a similar (and even more
pronounced) pattern. All SSM improvement was
seen during the first 4 weeks of therapy, with no
additional change for the rest of the follow up.
Again, this rapid decrease, along with the strong
correlation with the decrease in liver stiffness (and
liver inflammation), suggests that the main driver
for this improvement is not only spleen congestion
and portal hypertension decrease. Although spleen
stiffness has been correlated with HVPG16,25,26
and a reduction in HVPG during HCV treatment
has been demonstrated in previous studies,3,4,27 it
seems plausible that other explanations are needed
for this rapid change in spleen stiffness. In that
sense, the splenomegaly classically associated to
portal hypertension could be considered as a com-
posite of congestion, enlargement and hyperplasia
of splenic lymphoid tissue (white pulp), and
increased angiogenesis and fibrogenesis.28,29 In
addition, increased splenic inflammation might
have an additional role in HCV-infected patients,
considering that spleen could be regarded as a
large lymph node and HCV-infected patients con-
sistently show hepatic perihiliar adenomegalies on
liver imaging. Altogether, these findings point out
to a rapid improvement in spleen inflammation or
spleen remodelling due to a decrease in lymphoid
tissue infiltration as the main cause for the initial
spleen stiffness decrease. However, a very early
decrease in portal pressure due to reduced liver
inflammation could also partially contribute to
decrease spleen stiffness.
Finally, as expected, all analytical parameters
improved during follow up, and those not affected
by RBV, improved also very early (4 weeks) dur-
ing therapy. Platelet counts also followed this pat-
tern, and again, most of the improvement
observed during follow up occurred at 4 weeks of
therapy. Remarkably, patients in whom a signifi-
cant improvement of SSM was observed pre-
sented the greater increase in platelet counts, as
compared with patients without significant SSM
improvement (Fig. 5). Similar results were
obtained comparing patients with or without
LSM improvement. Although a correlation
between changes in spleen size and increase in
platelet counts after HCV therapy has been
reported,30 in our case, differences in spleen size
were not observed, probably due to the short fol-
low up. Platelet counts have been shown to
increase years after SVR due to improvement in
thrombopoietin production, improvement in por-
tal hypertension and reversal of splenomegaly.30
In our case, the rapid improvement and correla-
tion with SSM changes suggests that platelets
increase mainly due to spleen release secondary
to decreased spleen sequestration.
The limitations of the present study include the
small sample size and the lack of external valida-
tion. The small sample size limits the ability to
control confounding factors through multivariate
regression analysis. Also the lack of simultaneous
liver biopsy and HVPG information is a weakness
of our study with a very difficult solution, since it
would be probably unethical to perform them at 4
weeks of therapy. Moreover, SSM may be techni-
cally difficult to perform in clinical practice due to
the need to carry out an ultrasound prior to TE to
localize the spleen, and the fact that TE is not
optimized for SSM. As a consequence of that, not
all patients could be evaluated for SSM and the
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(8)

results might have been altered. However, we feel
that this is not the case, since SSM correlated
very well with LSM and platelet findings, and
SSM values remained very constant after the ini-
tial decrease. Another limitation is that most of
the patients (88%) were genotype 1 and all of
them were White. Both genotype and ethnicity
have been known to affect kinetics of liver fibrosis
related to HCV.31 Finally, the lack of a longer fol-
low up limits the capacity to detect long-term
changes in LSM and SSM that are probably
related to fibrosis improvement.
In conclusion, liver and spleen stiffness decrease
significantly and very rapidly during DAA treat-
ment of HCV-infected cACLD patients and this
improvement accounts for most of the stiffness
improvement observed during follow up, suggest-
ing that it most probably reflects liver and spleen
improvement in inflammation and cell infiltra-
tion. These findings have important clinical
implications for the follow up of cACLD HCV-
cured patients, since changes in LSM after SVR
cannot be interpreted just as a reduction of liver
fibrosis (at least during the first year of follow up).
Consequently, patients with cACLD prior to
SVR cannot be discharged from follow up based
on LSM improvements. Until more information
from patients with longer follow up and with liver
biopsy information is gathered, patients will have
to remain under surveillance.
