To understand the effects on public health of
exposure to environmental chemicals requires
establishing relationships among events along
an exposure­health evaluation­risk assessment
continuum (National Research Council 2006).
Biomonitoring data, such as chemical concen-
trations in tissues and fluids, are a measure of
internal exposure and represent one event along
the continuum to be linked with external expo-
sure and biologically effective dose. We focus
here on the relationship between internal and
external exposure, with external exposure being
a measure of environmental chemical concen-
tration in contact with the body. Often, how-
ever, biomonitoring data are reported without
corresponding external exposure data, leaving
the relationship between internal and external
exposure as one to be determined; establishing
this relationship involves the reconstruction of
past external exposure or dose, from biomoni-
toring data collected at some later time. Such
exposure reconstruction can be addressed at
both the individual and the population level. A
procedure for determining an estimate of
external exposure consistent with biomonitor-
ing data measured in a population has been
termed "exposure reconstruction" or "reverse
dosimetry."
A population-based estimate of exposure
should account for the intrinsic heterogeneity
(variability) in the population, both in the
modeling of the disposition of the chemical
in the body, and in the description of the
exposure conditions. Additionally, the bio-
monitoring information itself, considered as a
whole, should reflect the variability in the
population from which it arises.
Tan et al. (2006) incorporated variability
into the reverse dosimetry of chloroform using
a combined physiologically based pharmaco-
kinetic (PBPK) and shower exposure model,
with external exposure calculated using an
exposure conversion factor (ECF) distribu-
tion. The ECF distribution was obtained by
inverting the output of a Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation for chloroform concentration in
blood using, as input, a preselected reference
value for chloroform concentration in tap
water. The product of the ECF distribution
with an observed blood concentration pro-
vides a distribution of tap water concentra-
tions corresponding to that blood level.
Although the ECF distribution provides a
population estimate of exposure, its accuracy
is limited to the case in which tissue dose is
linearly related to external exposure. In this
article, we reconsider the work of Tan et al.
(2006) with an approach to reverse dosimetry
using Bayesian inference in place of the ECF
distribution.
In addition to the work of Tan et al.
(2006), exposure reconstruction for chloroform
using PBPK modeling has appeared in
Georgopoulos et al. (1994) and Roy et al.
(1996) in the form of a maximum likelihood
calculation. In this case, the biological model
parameters remained as fixed values represent-
ing an average or reference individual and did
not account for population variability. The
report by Tan et al. (2007) included a calcula-
tion of chloroform tap water concentration
using Bayes' theorem, but with the prior distri-
bution taken as unity, which reduced Bayes'
theorem to a maximum likelihood calculation.
Previous work using Bayesian methods
for exposure reconstruction for other chemi-
cals has appeared in Miller et al. (2002), Sohn
et al. (2004), and Allen et al. (2007). The
work of Miller et al. (2002) described a gen-
eral procedure for individual dose reconstruc-
tion using Bayesian inference and Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In
this case, the model for chemical disposition
was a traditional compartment-based kinetic
model for plutonium-239, which was applied
to individual exposure reconstruction for
239Pu from urine measurements. Although
the model used was not a PBPK model and
did not address population-based measure-
ments and variability, it served as the moti-
vating example in formulating the details of
the method we present in this article.
Sohn et al. (2004) used a PBPK model and
Bayesian inference to reconstruct exposure to
trichloroethylene from detailed concentration­
time data for eight individuals. They obtained a
population estimate by treating the individuals
as a random sample from a larger population
without the use of a hierarchical population
model or the use of MCMC simulation. They

BACKGROUND: One problem of interpreting population-based biomonitoring data is the
reconstruction of corresponding external exposure in cases where no such data are available.
OBJECTIVES: We demonstrate the use of a computational framework that integrates physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, Bayesian inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sim-
ulation to obtain a population estimate of environmental chloroform source concentrations consis-
tent with human biomonitoring data. The biomonitoring data consist of chloroform blood
concentrations measured as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), and for which no corresponding exposure data were collected.
METHODS: We used a combined PBPK and shower exposure model to consider several routes and
sources of exposure: ingestion of tap water, inhalation of ambient household air, and inhalation and
dermal absorption while showering. We determined posterior distributions for chloroform concen-
tration in tap water and ambient household air using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Total
Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) data as prior distributions for the Bayesian analysis.
RESULTS: Posterior distributions for exposure indicate that 95% of the population represented by
the NHANES III data had likely chloroform exposures  67 µg/L in tap water and  0.02 µg/L in
ambient household air.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the application of computer simulation to aid in the inter-
pretation of human biomonitoring data in the context of the exposure­health evaluation­risk
assessment continuum. These results should be considered as a demonstration of the method and
can be improved with the addition of more detailed data.

simulation to build up a library of terms for
the likelihood and prior incorporating distribu-
tions for PBPK model parameters to account
for population variability.
Allen et al. (2007) recently reconstructed
exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) in
women of childbearing age and pregnant
women, using a method similar to that pre-
sented here. Their application involved two
stages of Bayesian updating to recalibrate the
PBPK model parameters along with oral
absorption of MeHg for the subpopulation of
interest. Both the method of Allen et al.
(2007) and the method presented here are
based on the work of Gelman et al. (1996),
which was presented as a general method of
parameter estimation in PBPK models. This
method originally was applied to PBPK model
calibration, and examples and reviews can be
found in a number of articles (Bernillon and
Bois, 2000; Covington et al. 2007; Hack et al.
2006; Jonsson 2001).
We view reverse dosimetry as a type of
PBPK model calibration problem, which
allows us to use established methods and tools
to aid in the interpretation of population-
based biomonitoring data.
Reverse dosimetry. The fundamental prob-
lem underlying reverse dosimetry is to relate a
measured internal dose, or tissue concentra-
tion, CT
, to an unmeasured external exposure
or dose, CD
, given a deterministic model f (we
consider f to be minimally a PBPK model).
The usual mode of operation for f is to solve
the "forward problem" of determining the tis-
sue concentration given a known external dose:
CT
= f (CD
). If our model is such that an
appropriate inverse f ­1 can be found, then the
reverse problem can be solved as CD
= f ­1(CT
).
Typically, however, f is such that an inverse
either does not exist or may not be unique, or
may be unstable, meaning that a small change
in the data may lead to a large change in out-
put of the inverse function; that is, the reverse
problem is usually "ill-posed" (Hadamard
1902). Additional complications arise when
considering the population-based nature of the
biomonitoring data where population variabil-
ity becomes a significant factor that needs to be
incorporated into the solution for CD
. Also,
biomonitoring data represent accumulation of
chemicals in the body from all possible sources
and routes of exposure, and we may need to
account for multiple simultaneous indepen-
dent inputs into the model.
Bayesian inference. A Bayesian approach
determines CD
as a probability distribution
rather than a single value, the starting point
being the treatment of all observables and para-
meters of interest as random variables. The
external dose CD
is assigned a "prior" probabil-
ity distribution representing knowledge about
CD
before consideration of the data CT
. The
prior distribution is updated via Bayes' theo-
rem, into a "posterior" probability distribution
for CD
conditioned on the data CT
. Bayes' the-
orem can be written as
where p(CD
) is the prior, p(CT
|CD
) is the
likelihood, and p(CD
|CT
) is the posterior.
The likelihood is the conditional distribution
p(CT
|CD
) viewed as a function of CD
and
whose functional form is based on the specifi-
cation of a measurement model that describes
the difference between observation and model
prediction in terms of an error.
A significant aspect of PBPK models is that
all of the parameters have a physical or biologi-
cal interpretation: they are not arbitrary. We
can use knowledge regarding possible ranges,
central values, and measures of dispersion, as
well as specific data from separate studies, to
define informative prior distributions.
The product of the prior and likelihood
gives (up to a normalization constant) the pos-
terior distribution containing all information
regarding the parameter CD
consistent with
the data and prior information. The posterior
distribution is the solution of the reverse prob-
lem, and all further inferences regarding CD
is
made from it in terms of expectation values of
functions of CD
.
For most cases of practical interest, the nor-
malized posterior distribution is evaluated via
numerical simulation. MCMC simulation is
the standard method used for Bayesian analysis
(Gelman and Rubin 1996; Gilks et al. 1996).
MCMC simulation refers to a class of iterative
simulations in which the random variables of
interest are drawn from a sequence, or chain, of
distributions that eventually converge to a sta-
ble posterior distribution. These chains can be
determined by rejection sampling algorithms
where a random draw is accepted or rejected
based on a simple probabilistic rule (e.g., the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; see Gilks et al.
1996). Convergence can be assessed by running
multiple chains and comparing the variance
within and between the sequences via a "poten-
tial scale reduction" factor R
^ (Gelman et al.
2004). R
^ is such that limn R
^ = 1, where n is
the number of iterations. Gelman et al. (2004)
recommend continuing iterations until R
^ < 1.1
for each parameter of interest. Once conver-
gence is obtained, the multiple chains can be
aggregated and considered to be a sample from
a discrete approximation to the posterior distri-
bution. The expectation value E[h(CD
)] of an
arbitrary function h(CD
) can be estimated by
drawing {CDk,
k = 1, . . . , N } from the poste-
rior and calculating the following:
For example, we can estimate the expected
value for CD
as the sample mean of the poste-
rior distribution. Note also that CD
can consist
of multiple components, the posterior being a
joint distribution from which we can calculate
marginal distributions for each component.
The above discussion describes the basic
elements of a Bayesian analysis that would
apply to an estimate of external dose for an
individual based on data collected for that indi-
vidual. The reverse dosimetry problem, how-
ever, is a problem of statistical inference: we
wish to determine an estimate of exposure for
the general population based on biomonitoring
data collected from a representative sample of
that population. We can address this statistical
aspect of the problem by combining Bayesian
analysis with a population model.
Materials and Methods
We applied the Bayesian population analysis of
Gelman et al. (1996) to the problem of reverse
dosimetry for chloroform to obtain population
estimates of chloroform concentrations in tap
water and ambient household air under resi-
dential exposure conditions. We viewed reverse
dosimetry as a type of model calibration prob-
lem where, using an otherwise calibrated
model, we determined unmeasured exposure
parameters based on the measured biomonitor-
ing data. The basic elements of the analysis
include a PBPK + shower model, prior chloro-
form concentration measurements in tap water
and ambient air from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Total Exposure
Assessment Methodology (TEAM) study
(Wallace 1997), and biomonitoring data in the
form of chloroform concentrations in blood
measured as part of the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 1996). With some noted excep-
tions, we use the PBPK + shower model, para-
meter distributions, definition of exposure, and
experimental data provided in Tan et al.
(2006, 2007); however, these elements have a
different rationale and purpose in the context
of the Bayesian population framework pre-
sented here, than that of the ECF distribution
or likelihood-based methods.
The TEAM study data we used here were
collected during 1981­1984 from a different
population than that used for the NHANES III
data, which were gathered during 1988­1992.
No exposure data were collected corresponding
to the NHANES III biomonitoring data, and
the objective here is to determine an estimate
for such corresponding exposure.
The reverse dosimetry problem for chlo-
roform is to relate a sample of chloroform
blood concentrations, CV
, to an unmeasured
population distribution of environmental
chloroform source concentrations, CS

deterministic model f = f (t, , CS
) is the
PBPK + shower model and represents the
solution to a set of differential equations
derived from biological and physical principles
considered to be common to all members of
the population; it is a function of time t and a
set of parameters whose values distinguish the
various individuals. We divided the parame-
ters into those that are to be updated in the
analysis, that is, the unmeasured source con-
centrations CS
= (CW
, CA
), and those that are
to remain fixed, where CW
and CA
are the con-
centrations in water and air, respectively. We
designate the fixed parameters by , which can
be single-point values or fixed distributions
representing pharmacokinetic, shower model,
and other exposure parameters such as drink-
ing water intake and shower duration.
Population variability is described by con-
sidering individual values for CS
to arise
independently from a population distribution
parameterized by a population mean µ and a
population variance . The introduction of
population parameters induces a hierarchical
structure among the model parameters that,
along with the specification of the determinis-
tic model quantities and error, defines the
population model. The population model,
specifying the conditional dependencies
among the population and individual para-
meters and the link through the deterministic
model to the data and error, can be summa-
rized as a graphical model (Figure 1). Here,
blood and source concentrations are related at
the individual level through the deterministic
model, with source and error parameter val-
ues for each individual arising independently
from population-level distributions.
The Bayesian analysis proceeds as
described above, but with the additional
structure among the parameters in the popu-
lation model incorporated into the terms in
Bayes' theorem. Writing the joint prior prob-
ability distribution as p(µ, , CS
, 2), we use
the conditional dependencies encoded in the
graphical model to obtain p(µ, , CS
, 2) =
p(µ) p() p(CS
|µ, ) p(2). Similarly, the
likelihood is p(CV
|µ, , CS
, 2) = p(CV
|CS
,
2). Bayes' theorem then takes the form
Once we specified the prior distributions
for µ, , and 2, the next step was to calculate
the posterior distribution conditioned on the
observed data and to calculate the statistical
quantities for the parameters of interest.
Figure 2 illustrates the relationships among
the basic elements used in the Bayesian analy-
sis. Random draws from the prior distributions
for water and air concentrations, and from
fixed distributions for pharmacokinetic, shower
model, and other exposure parameters, define
individual parameter sets from which we calcu-
lated model predictions for chloroform blood
concentrations. We compared predicted blood
concentrations with the observed concentra-
tions and accepted the sampled values for
water and air with probability defined in the
MCMC algorithm. Using the output parame-
ters of one iteration as the input for the next,
we repeated the procedure until the parameter
distributions for water and air became stable,
and then transformed the prior distribution to
the posterior distribution.
The analysis of the reverse dosimetry
problem consists of the following steps:
· Specification of the probability model: speci-
fication of the joint probability distribution
incorporating the PBPK + shower model,
hierarchical population model, measurement
model, and the specification of prior parame-
ter distributions

rior distribution conditioned on the observed

· Evaluation of the results: comparison of prior
and posterior distributions of exposure using
MC simulation to generate model predic-
tions for the observed biomonitoring data,
evaluation of parameter independence, and
comparison with previously obtained results.
We performed all model simulations
using MCSim, version 5.1 beta (Bois and
Maszle 1997), compiled and run on an Intel
Pentium 4 CPU (2.80 GHz) with Linux ker-
nel 2.6.17-12. MCSim uses LSODES
(Hindmarsh 1983) as the differential equation
solver, and Metropolis-Hastings (Hastings
1970; Metropolis et al. 1953) sampling for
MCMC simulation.
Probability model. We placed the PBPK +
shower, measurement, and population models
into a probability context through the specifi-
cation of distributions for the likelihood and
priors. We then combined these into an
expression for the posterior distribution for
Bayesian analysis.
PBPK + shower model. The PBPK +
shower exposure model consists of a PBPK
model for chloroform (Corley et al. 2000)
combined with a mass transfer model for
chloroform volatilized from shower water
(Weisel et al. 1999). We consider the model
validated for the forward problem under con-
trolled experimental conditions; that is, the
model accurately predicts measured concen-
tration­time profiles for a known external
dose. Figure 3 illustrates this model.
The shower model consists of a shower
stall in which chloroform is volatilized from a
plug flow stream of tap water into well-mixed
shower stall air. Model parameters include
shower water flow rate, shower stall volume,
and a chloroform mass transfer coefficient
accounting for details of the shower system
that were not explicitly modeled (e.g., shower
head design).
The PBPK model consists of seven com-
partments with chloroform exposure specified
as inhalation, dermal, and ingestion. We con-
sider inhalation exposure to be from chloro-
form in ambient household air and from
chloroform volatilized from shower water
during showering. Inhalation exposure is
indicated in the gas exchange compartment,
which we consider to be under equilibrium
and steady-state conditions. We define dermal
exposure as a net flux of chloroform into the
skin via passive diffusion from direct contact
with water while showering. Ingestion is via
drinking water, which we indicate as absorp-
tion directly into the liver. Elimination of
chloroform is through exhalation from the gas
exchange compartment and metabolism in
the liver and kidney compartments.
In order to maintain physiologic con-
straints during MC and MCMC simulations,
we made the following modifications to the
PBPK model (see, e.g., Marino et al. 2006):
a) correlating cardiac output with alveolar ven-
tilation rate through the ventilation perfusion
ratio (ventilation rate/cardiac output), b) con-
straining fractional blood flows to sum to unity
by dividing the fractional blood flow to each
tissue by the sum of fractional blood flows to
all tissues, and c) constraining fractional tissue
volumes to sum to 0.91, by multiplying each
fractional tissue volume by 0.91 and dividing
by the total fractional tissue volume. We chose
value 0.91 to match the total fractional tissue
volume used previously (Tan et al. 2006).
Pharmacokinetic parameters. With the
exception of body weight and the ventilation
perfusion ratio, all pharmacokinetic parameter
values and distributions are those given in Tan
et al. (2006). We describe body weight with a
normal distribution with mean of 70 kg
(Brown et al. 1997) and coefficient of varia-
tion of 30%. We took the ventilation perfu-
sion ratio as lognormal with a mean of 1.45
and a coefficient of variation of 18%, calcu-
lated from the cardiac output and alveolar
ventilation data given in Tan et al. (2006).
Exposure parameters. Consistent with
Tan et al. (2006), we defined exposure in
terms of the following seven parameters:
a) chloroform concentration in tap water,
b) chloroform concentration in ambient
household air, c) shower duration, d) shower
water flow rate, e) shower stall dimensions,
f ) chloroform mass transfer coefficient, and
g) daily drinking water intake.
Distributions for several of the exposure
parameters were provided by Tan et al. (2006),
who used them to generate distributions for
MC simulation equivalent to a linear interpo-
lation between data points. Here, we fitted
smooth normal or lognormal distributions to
the percentile data (Table 1). We obtained all
curve fits to percentile data using Gnuplot,
version 4.0 (Gnuplot 2007), which uses a non-
linear least-squares algorithm (Marquardt-
Levenberg) to determine a best fit.
We truncated these parameter distribu-
tions to include 95% of the distribution
(mean ± 1.96 SD for a normal distribution)
to avoid sampling from implausible values
and to be consistent with the truncations used
previously (Tan et al. 2006).
The notation  ~ N(M, S2) indicates the
parameter  is distributed normally with
mean M and variance S 2. For data that are
lognormally distributed with sample mean M
and variance S2, the notation
indicates the log-transformed quantity is nor-
mally distributed with the following mean
and variance:
where the coefficient of variation (CV) =
S/M. We also used geometric mean GM =
exp(M
^ ) and geometric standard deviation
GSD = exp(S
^) to characterize the central value
and dispersion for the lognormally distributed
quantities.
We found no significant deviations of the
curve fits from the percentile data, with the
exception of that for chloroform concentra-
tion in tap water, which underestimates the
25th percentile point (Figure 4). The data we
used for chloroform concentration in tap
water (Wallace 1997) consisted of three sam-
ples from Bayonnne­Elizabeth, New Jersey,
and three samples from Los Angeles and
Antioch­Pittsburg, California. The 25th per-
centile point came only from the California
samples that had concentration values approx-
imately half that of the New Jersey measure-
ments for the other percentiles. Also, in the
context of the reverse dosimetry problem
addressed here, we considered the parameters
CW
and CA
to be unmeasured. We used the
distributions for these terms to define prior
distributions, which we will update based on
the measured biomonitoring data. Because we
have a good fit to the median and upper per-
centile values, we maintain the fitted curve as a

Population and measurement models.
Figure 2 graphically depicts the population
model describing the relationships among
model quantities, parameters, and observ-
ables. The source concentration CS
consists of
two independent components corresponding
to tap water and ambient air concentrations
CS
= (CW
, CA
). The population mean and
variance terms are then µ = (µW
, µA
) and  =
(W
, A
). The variance 2 consists of only a
single component corresponding to error in
chloroform blood concentration measure-
ments. The population model specifies the
relationship among parameters before consid-
eration of the data; it may be that condition-
ing on the data induces a correlation among
components initially specified as independent.
For the measurement model, we consid-
ered I individuals, from each of whom we
simulated a single chloroform blood concen-
tration CVi

Prior distributions. We assigned prior
distributions for each component of the
population mean µ = µ(M, S2) based on the
best estimate of the mean M and variance S2
for the parameter of interest; that is, we inter-
preted a prior estimate of the mean and vari-
ance of the parameter as a prior distribution
of means for that parameter. From Table 1,
we have the prior population mean distribu-
tion for chloroform concentration in tap
water, µW
~ N(50, (20)2), truncated to
include the interval (10.8, 89.2). We used the
log-transformed distribution for ambient air
concentrations, taking the population mean
distribution as ln(µA
) ~ N(­5.68, (1.32)2) trun-
cated to include the interval (­8.27, ­3.09).
The truncations are such as to include 95% of
the distributions, with units defined as in
Table 1.
The prior distributions for the population
variances  are described with an inverse
gamma (Inv-) distribution (Carlin and Louis
2000),  ~ Inv-(, ), where  > 0 is the
shape parameter and  > 0 is the scale parame-
ter; the mean and variance can be expressed,
respectively, as
and
We set the prior values for  and  by set-
ting the mean and standard deviation of 
equal to the variance of that population mean
distribution defined by the expected value
for µ. This gives  = 3, and for µ ~ N(M, S2),
we have  = ( ­ 1) × 
­
= 2S2.
For lognormally distributed µ, with
lnµ ~ N(M
^ , S
^2),  = 2S
^2. From Table 1 then,
W
~ Inv-(3, 800) and A
~ Inv-(3, 3.48).
A standard prior for the error distribution,
2, is a noninformative log-uniform distribu-
tion, which we take over the interval [0.001,
100] (pg/mL)2 in natural space.
Bayesian inference. We calculated the
posterior distribution p(µ, , CS
, 2 |CV
)
using MCMC simulation conditioned on the
observed biomonitoring data. We interpreted
the expected values of the posterior popula-
tion mean and variance distributions as the
updated mean and variance parameters for
the source concentration distributions as CS
=
CS
(µ
­, 
­
) where µ
­ = E(µ) and 
­
= E().
Biomonitoring data. The biomonitoring
data consist of concentrations of chloroform
in blood measured as part of NHANES III,
with blood sample collection times occurring
between 0800 hours and 2300 hours. The
blood concentrations were reported in per-
centile form; to obtain individual data for
MCMC simulation, we first fitted the per-
centile data to a lognormal distribution
ln(CV
) ~ N(3.12, (0.944)2), where CV
denotes
chloroform blood concentration (picograms
per milliliter).
We truncated the distribution to include
95% of the values and generated individual
chloroform blood concentrations by random
draws from this truncated distribution to gen-
erate data corresponding to I = 80 individual
measurements. We chose the limit of 80 due
to computational time considerations (simu-
lations ran about 11 hr each). We distributed
the sampled blood concentrations uniformly
over each hour in the sampling time interval:
five random data points per hour, for each
hour in the interval 0800­2300 hours.
Exposure regimen. We assumed continu-
ous water intake at a constant rate from
0600 hours to 2200 hours, and a single
shower start time of 1010 hours. We obtained
the shower start time as the 50th percentile
(median) of the shower start time distribution
used by Tan et al. (2006). Our regimen was
simplified from that of Tan et al. (2006), who
used a pulsed water intake and a distribution
for shower start time. The influence of the
shower start time, in the context of the prob-
lem at hand, is to provide a time point that,
combined with shower duration, defines an
upper or lower bound to the time interval
between shower exposure and sampling time.
Beyond the time interval of 0800­2300 hours,
no data are available regarding blood sampling
time and exposure; we used the distribution of
chloroform blood concentrations throughout
the sampling interval to account for variation
between exposure and blood sampling time.
We considered inhalation of chloroform in
ambient household air to be constant.
MCMC simulation. The MCMC simula-
tions consisted of three independent chains of
10,000 iterations. We discarded the first
5,000 iterations and assessed convergence for
each of the parameters of interest using the
potential scale reduction factor of Gelman
et al. (2004), with R
^ < 1.1 as criteria for con-
vergence. We then aggregated the independent
chains for each parameter and considered them
to be a sample from the posterior distribution.

blood concentrations using both the prior and
posterior distributions for chloroform tap water
and ambient air concentrations along with the
distributions for the PBPK + shower model and
exposure parameters. We ran the MC simula-
tions (10,000 iterations) corresponding to each
hour in the interval 0800­2300 hours. We
aggregated the simulations for each hour into a
single distribution function and compared it
with the observed blood concentrations from
the NHANES III data.
Posterior correlation of parameters. We
checked the assumption of independence
between tap water and ambient air concentra-
tions through the posterior correlations that
might have arisen following conditioning on
the data. For each individual i, we have in the
aggregated posterior distribution 15,000 pairs
of individual tap water and ambient air con-
centrations (CWi
, ln(CA
)i
). We calculated the
individual sample correlations ri
= corr(CWi
,
ln(CA
)i
), i = 1, . . . , I, and estimated the popu-
lation correlation as the mean of all the ri
.
Comparison with previously obtained
results. We compared the posterior chloro-
form tap water distribution with the results
using the ECF distribution reported by Tan
et al. (2006). We generated a distribution of
chloroform blood concentrations as 10,000
random draws from the distribution defined
by the curve fit for CV
. The product of this
distribution and the ECF distribution yields a
distribution for chloroform concentrations in
tap water.
Results
MCMC simulations. The MCMC simula-
tions converged to R
^ < 1.02 for each of the
population mean and variance parameters.
The posterior means and variances, along
with the prior values, are noted in Table 2,
with the probability density functions plotted
in Figures 5 and 6.
The posterior distributions represent
likely distributions for chloroform concentra-
tions in tap water and ambient air consistent
with the biomonitoring data, as well as the
assumptions and constraints imposed by the
model, exposure regimen, and prior distribu-
tions. The posterior distribution for tap water
concentrations shows a decrease in the
median and variance compared with the
TEAM data (Wallace 1997), and the poste-
rior distribution for ambient air concentra-
tions shows an increase in the geometric mean
and decrease in the geometric SD. A proper
assessment of these results requires a direct
comparison of the posterior distributions with
exposure data that would correspond to the
NHANES III blood concentrations, and no
such data are available at this time. We also
evaluated the results by comparison of model
predictions for blood concentrations using the
posterior distributions for exposure.
MC simulations. Table 3 and Figure 7
show the results of the MC simulations for
chloroform blood concentrations using the
prior and posterior concentrations for chloro-
form in tap water and ambient household air.
The results for the prior distribution agree
closely with the results reported previously
(Tan et al. 2006) for the case where chloro-
form concentration in air is independent of
that in water, indicating that the simplifica-
tions in exposure regimen used here had little
effect on blood concentration compared with
the more detailed regimen. The posterior val-
ues for tap water and ambient air concentra-
tions provide a better match to the observed
values than do the priors, particularly for the
median blood concentration. Comparing the
prior and posterior curve fits in terms of the
residual sum of squares (RSS), we have
RSSprior
= 201 (pg/mL)2 and RSSposterior
=
46 (pg/mL)2.
Correlation between ambient air and tap
water concentrations. The average individual
sample correlation between chloroform tap
water and ambient air concentrations from the
posterior distribution was r­ = ­0.05 with
SE = 0.004. We interpret this as indicating lit-
tle, if any, correlation between chloroform tap
water and ambient air concentrations induced
by conditioning on the NHANES III data.
The lack of correlation between air and water
concentrations suggests that air concentration
levels are more the result of other factors, such
as use of cleaning products, and nonlinear
mixing effects involving ventilation, use of
dishwashers and washing machines, or other
modes of chloroform source concentrations.
Comparison with results from the ECF
distribution approach. Table 4 shows the per-
centile values for chloroform concentrations in
tap water from the posterior distribution in
Table 2 and also as the product of measured
blood concentrations and the ECF distribution.
The ECF distribution gives very high val-
ues for the upper percentiles that are not pre-
sent in the results for the Bayesian approach.
The results of the Bayesian analysis are consis-
tent with the TEAM data and provide expo-
sure distributions that lead to close agreement
between model predictions of chloroform
blood concentration and the observed bio-
monitoring data.
Ambient air concentration was provided by
Tan et al. (2006) through the relationship CA
(ppm) = 0.0179 × CW
(mg/L); they reported
no results corresponding to a posterior distrib-
ution for the case in which these quantities are
independent.
Conclusions
In this article we presented a method for
interpreting biomonitoring data in the con-
text of the exposure­health evaluation­risk
assessment continuum. The Bayesian analysis
we used here relates population-based meas-
urements of chloroform blood concentrations
to chloroform exposure in terms of tap water
and ambient household air concentrations
given as the posterior distributions in Table 2.
This places biomonitoring information in a
health-based context by relating it to expo-
sure-based quantities such as maximum con-
taminant level (MCL) and reference dose
(RfD). With the understanding that the
method we used here has not been subjected
to comparison with experimental data for
exposure, and that the numbers presented are

for demonstration of the method, we note
from Table 4 that 95% of the population rep-
resented by the NHANES III data was likely
to be exposed to  67 ppb chloroform in
water, which can be compared with the MCL
for trihalomethanes of 100 ppb (U.S. EPA
2007). Using distributions for the posterior
concentration of chloroform in tap water
(CW
), daily water intake (WI
), and body
weight (BW), we drew 10,000 samples from
the product CW
WI
/BW to obtain a daily
chloroform intake from drinking water
(Table 5). The RfD for chloroform is
0.01 mg/kg/day (U.S. EPA 2001). The 95th
percentile for the posterior distribution for
chloroform concentration in ambient air is
0.02 µg/L. The U.S. EPA currently does not
have an established inhalation reference con-
centration for chloroform (U.S. EPA 2001).
The accuracy of the results is limited by the
approximate nature of the model, the assump-
tions regarding exposure, and the quality of the
experimental data. In particular, the prior dis-
tribution from the TEAM data did not corre-
spond to the same population as that of the
NHANES III data, and although it provided
an informative prior, data from the same loca-
tions and time frame as the NHANES III data,
even if not corresponding to the individuals in
that study, would likely improve the accuracy
of the results. Although the method presented
here is intended to be a tool to reconstruct
exposure from biomonitoring data where no
corresponding exposure data are available,
comparison of the results with such data would
greatly assist in assessing the accuracy of the
method, and such results could be incorpo-
rated as prior distributions for additional
chloroform dose reconstructions.
