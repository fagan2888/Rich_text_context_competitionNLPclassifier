Introduction
This article looks at the English spelling system against the
background of Educated Nigerian English (ENE), stressing
the need for the nativization and reform of English spelling
to distinguish the variety called ENE from Standard British
English (SBE) and American varieties and to enhance teach-
ing and learning written communication in English as a
Second Language (ESL) settings. ENE application of spell-
ing rules and punctuation marks has consistently remained
British and sometimesAmerican.All variations of spelling in
ENE that do not conform to SBE or American spelling are
treated as errors. Yet, spelling is a major aspect of language
mechanics that poses an intractable challenge to educated
Nigerians. From the primary school to the university level,
students and scholars make concerted efforts to achieve mas-
tery in spelling. In addition to concord errors, spelling errors
annoy examiners and receive institutionalized penalty during
English language paper examining in the West African
Examination Council (WAEC), National Examination
Council (NECO), General Certificate Examination (GCE),
and in language and communication-based fields of study in
higher institutions. Usually, half a mark is deducted for any
error of spelling. While some morphological, syntactic, and
semantic variations may be condoned in ENE, spelling varia-
tions are treated as errors. Nevertheless, a critical examina-
tionofthesituationshowsthatthesamepsycho-sociolinguistic
factors that cause grammatical and semantic variations also
cause spelling variations. Hence, this article critically exam-
ines the challenge of spelling in Nigerian English (NE) in
particular and World English in general. Several research
questions guided the examination of issues in this article: Do
educated Nigerians misspell English words? Do educated
Nigerians support spelling reform or nativization? What
sorts of spelling reform do educated Nigerians prefer?
Method
Observation, interview, and questionnaire were used to gen-
erate data from educated Nigerians in 10 federal government
owned universities across Nigeria from 2005 to 2012. First,
the common, habitual way in which educated Nigerians spelt
some words was observed during this period. Second, some
of the words were used to construct some questionnaires
with general closed-ended questions on the nature of English
spelling. The interviews, which were unstructured, took the
form of dictation from class to class in the 10 universities

Suggested Spelling Reform in Educated
Nigerian English (ENE): Who Bells the
Cat?
Steve Bode Omowumi Ekundayo1
Abstract
Written English is one area in which Nigerian linguists and grammarians do not accommodate variations of spelling for any
sociolinguistic reason, even though they at times misspell or forget the spelling of some confusing words. Most people agree
that English spelling system is problematic and therefore needs urgent reform, but who bells the cat? This article examines
the English spelling system against the backdrop of Educated Nigerian English and the concept of nativization, stressing the
need for reform or nativized spelling in Nigerian English. Questionnaires, library research, and the Internet were used to
gather data for this study. The qualitative approach has been adopted in the main for the interpretation of data. The educated
Nigerians studied admit that the English spelling system is in part so confusing that they misspell words at times. Therefore,
they support the reform or nativization of English spelling. Consequently, this article presents and illustrates proposed
reformed spelling by deleting redundant letters, unnecessary clusters of letters, dropping useless silent letters, regularizing
digraph, and spelling compound words in one form only. These changes will enhance spelling skills, teaching, reading, and
writing in English as a Second Language.

University of Ilorin, Ilorin, and University of Abuja, Federal

South). The selection of these universities was informed by
their strategic locations across Nigeria and the fact that they
use a Nigerian Federal Government policy called "Quota
System," or "Federal Character," to admit students from
"catchment areas" and all the regions of Nigeria.
Subjects aged between 19 and 70 years were tested from
professors, lecturers, and final year students of English and
Literature, Linguistics, and Communication Departments
who were considered, or should be, models of English use
and usage in Nigeria. The questionnaire was an adaptation or
nativization of Robert Baker's 1979/1980 questionnaire on
spelling reforms. Ten thousand of the questionnaire sheets
were collated and analyzed for compound word spelling. The
result is presented in a table in simple percentile count with
annotations. Some other parameters used were observed cur-
rency, ubiquity, and acceptability of the examples docu-
mented here among educated Nigerians.
Therefore, the article basically adopted both the qualita-
tive and, to some extent, the quantitative methods. The quali-
tative approach supports the use of the researcher's sensitivity
and keen attention to linguistic details, which determines
how the researcher interprets his or her data. In this regard,
keen attention was paid to the corpus of data generated on
spelling in particular and the English spelling system as well
as the structures of words in general. Conclusion and recom-
mendations were drawn from the responses collated and
observed trends.
History of English in Relation to Spelling
Little drops of spelling at different times and from different
sources made the present mighty and confusing ocean of
English spelling system. Etymologically, the words English
and England derive from Anglo, Angles, or the Anglos, a
group of Germanic invaders of the British Isle who spoke a
Proto-Germanic language called Old English from 500 to
1100 AD (Osakwe, 2011). The varieties of English used dur-
ing Old and Middle English periods were in a flux until the
publication of Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English
Language in 1755, which subsequently established relative
stability in the spelling and meanings of words. However, the
language is still unstable; for even in Modern English, which
started in the 15th century, there are different varieties of
successive ages. The socio-political events and conquests of
each period heavily influenced the features of its English.
The Anglo-Saxon, Danish Invasions, and particularly the
Norman Conquest in 1066, left their linguistic imprints in the
English that we use now. The Normans were Vikings in the
French Coast who invaded the English Isle, led by William
the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy. There language and
culture were French. They overwhelmed England militarily,
politically, culturally, and linguistically. Of all the invasions
of England, the Norman Conquest influenced the English
language more than any other (Jowitt, 2009; Kpolugbo,
2006; Ogu, 1992). Indeed, the conquest gave English many
French words that are still used today. Coming with these
words were new meanings, spellings, and pronunciations.
Brook (1958) said that the Norman Conquest introduced
"drastic modification of English spelling to make it conform
to the practice of French scribes" (p. 50), a view also shared
by Baugh and Cable (1978).
Tracing the origin of writing system, Bloomfield (1934)
stated that "learned scribes" did "invent pseudo-archaic
spelling" from "antiquated" spelling rules:
The words debt, doubt, subtle contained no [b]- in Old French,
whence English received them, and were written both in French
and in English as dette, doute, sutil; the present-day spellings
with b were invented by scribes who knew the far-off Latin
antecedents of the French words, debitum, dubito, subtilis. (p.
292)
Kimball (n.d.) is likewise of the view that present-day
spellings do not really reflect the history of how the words
have always been spelt:
We can't change spellings because the current forms reflect their
histories . . . ? The "s" in "island" was not in the original spelling,
but was inserted later--and thus is etymologically incorrect. The
"b" in "crumb" and "thumb" were intentionally added a few
centuries ago as silent letters. So was the "g" in "foreign" and
"sovereign" (those two words are completely unrelated to
"reign"), the "h" in "ghost," and the "p" in "ptarmigan." The "h"
and the "y" in "rhyme," and the use of "ch" in "ache" are
similarly spurious (one could make a case for the "c" in "ache"
having a historic basis, but the use of the "h" after it is purely
spurious). "Iland," "crum," "thum," "forein," "soverein,"
"gost," "tarmigan," "rime," and "ake" are spellings that more
closely show the true origins of those words, while the current
forms that "look right" are not really showing the correct history.
(p. 1)
In addition, other factors like the Renaissance, the Great
Vowel Shift, the coming of the printing press to England in
1476 by William Caxton, technology, the Industrial
Revolution, imperialism, and so on, introduced many words
and strange spellings into the English language (Crystal,
2005). The Great Vowel Shift, for instance, which took place
in the end of Middle English, witnessed a set of significant
vowel changes and additions. These changes led to major
differences between the spelling of Modern English and its
pronunciation at present (Udofot, 2010). The present spell-
ings of a number of words reflect the pronunciations of the
words in Old and Middle English. The Great Vowel Shift
created many phonological rules and caused differences
Ekundayo 3
between the articulation of some Modern English words and
their spellings (Akmajian, Demers, Farmer, & Harnish,
2006). With the emergence of the Internet, computer and cell
phones, and the enormous global reliance on them, new
spellings of words have emerged and gradually invaded the
territory of formal writing in standard spellings in world
Englishes, NE inclusive. For example, some SMS and email
writers now find it convenient to spell "you" as "u," "night'
as "nait" or "nite," "cook" as "kuk," and so on.
Nativization of English in Nigeria
The reality has been acknowledged that when a language
leaves its native land for a foreign land, it is bound to undergo
many sociolinguistic changes and manipulations (Ahwefeada
& Ojaruega, 2009; Bamgbose, 1995). Nativization is a term
now universally used in linguistics to denote the indigeniza-
tion of language in a nonnative, second language setting
(Kachru, 1992). According to Olatinwo (2009), nativization
means,
Acculturation or adaptability to new environment; it also
connotes naturalization, which is the term used when a person
takes up the citizenship of another country where he or she is
domiciled. Nativization is therefore a term now commonly used
among sociolinguists for describing the indigenization of
English in a second language environment. (p. 98)
"Nativisation is a common feature of all institutionalized
second language varieties of English" (Igboanusi, 2005, p.
35). Bamgbose (1995) said that nativization of English in
Nigeria goes beyond the transfer of Nigerian language fea-
tures into English. It also includes the creative use of English,
"including the evolution of distinctly Nigerian usages, atti-
tudes and pragmatic use of the language" (p. 11).
"Indigenization," "domestication," "naturalization," "accul-
turation," and "Nigerianisation" are also used to denote
nativization of English in Nigeria. In relation to the spelling
reform suggested here, a more proper term may be
Nigerianization or spelling innovation as the proposed
changes in spelling involve the manipulation, deletion, addi-
tion, and reorganization of English rules and symbols.
Nigerian English Varieties
Three major typologies are usually used for the categoriza-
tion of NE varieties; namely, regions, formal education, and
sociolinguistics. In terms of regions, there exist different
varieties of English in Nigeria: Hausa, Yoruba, Ibo, Efik,
Urhobo, and so on. Each regional variety has its linguistic
variations, on the one hand, and similarities to the others, on
the other hand. Phonological features differentiate regional
varieties. With formal education, a number of classifications
have been made. Prominent among them are Brosnahan's
(1958), Banjo's (1970, 1996) and Odumuh's (1980) Varieties
I, II, III, and IV and Adesanoye's (1973) written Varieties I,
II, and III (Sunday, 2008). Banjo's taxonomy, which is the
most popular, uses grammatical features and educational lev-
els to classify NE. Variety I is the lowest, which reflects vul-
gar errors of grammar and broken structures often used by
primary school pupils and those with half-baked formal edu-
cation. Variety II is an improvement on Variety I. This is the
variety that secondary school students and school certificate
holders use. Variety III is higher standard spoken by highly
educated Nigerians, graduates, teachers, lecturers, and so on.
He proposes this model for NE. Finally, Variety IV is native
English standard which few Nigerians who were born in
native English-speaking countries or have a parent of English
origin have acquired as their first language or "half mother
tongue," so to speak (Banjo, 1996). But Variety IV is often
regarded as too foreign.
On the sociolinguistic plane, three levels or lects are often
depicted: basilect, mesolect, and acrolect (Igene, 1992;
Ogbulogo, 2005). The educated Variety III of Banjo, which
is also acrolect on the sociolinguistic pyramid, is often rec-
ommended or preferred as Nigerian standard. Spelling errors
are regular features of all the varieties and lects, particularly
the lower varieties, for errors of spelling are reduced in
acrolect and the Variety III of Banjo, Odumuh, and
Adesanoye, which is ENE.
NE is being nativized in three major perspectives, which
are creative, contextual/situational, and linguistic. Many cre-
ative attempts necessitated by the desire to or exigency of
conveying new concepts and meanings have produced varia-
tions which distinguish NE varieties. A few examples are
"felabration," a creative coinage for the annual celebration of
Fela Anikulapokuti, the legendary Nigerian musician who
died in 1997; "aristo babe" used to denote a girl who dates
wealthy older men for money; "federal character" and "zon-
ing," which denote government and political party policy of
sharing national positions and resources equally to all feder-
ating units and rotating leadership among Nigerian geo-
political zones.
Furthermore, the Nigerian peculiar socio-cultural envi-
ronment has conditioned the use of some English words and
expressions in certain ways. Many indigenous Nigerian lan-
guage words have been borrowed into English, just as some
English words and phrases are carefully selected and bonded
to convey Nigerian concepts; for example, "guguru,"
"akara," "second burial ceremony," "fellow-in-law," and so
on, and many other examples annotated in a paper devoted to
neologisms in NE (Teilanyo, 2008).
Linguistic nativization is the highest of the three afore-
mentioned nativization dimensions; for all the features and
dimensions of nativization are expressed linguistically.
Generally, linguistic nativization occurs at all the levels of
linguistic organization and also involves the sociolinguistic
habit of language transfer and interference. Linguistic
domestication equally includes "intralingual interference
features" (Richards, 1984, p. 6) or "the overgeneralization of
4 SAGE Open
linguistic rules and semantic features" (Selinker, 1984, p.
37), which Ekundayo (2006, 2012) tagged "intraference";
for example in ENE, the use of "trickish" for "tricky"; "cal-
culative" for "calculating," "upliftment" for "uplift," "disvir-
gin" for "deflower" "convocate" for "convoke," and so on.
In orthography, however, NE has resisted nativization or
Nigerianization. The orthography of NE seems not to brook
second language learner variations, for all cases of difference
in spelling are treated strictly as errors. Yet, many cases of
misspelling abound in NE. The logical question, therefore, is
why are unconscious variations of spelling regarded as errors
while some variations at the other levels are accepted as
emerging NE. Current efforts at indigenizing English ought
to be extended to the orthographic level of linguistic organi-
zation, particularly the spelling system, a preoccupation of
this article. Indigenization spelling is another term for spell-
ing reform, an idea or proposal that many linguists support
and oppose.
Criticisms of English Spelling
Complaints about English spelling system have been with us
since the Middle English period. "In 1151, John Hart com-
plained of the `vices' of English writing, which cause it to be
`learned hard and evil to read'" (Crystal, 2005, p. 215).
Ferdinand de Saussure (1966) called the English spelling
system "an edifice of confusion," "inconsistencies," and
"monstrosities" (pp. 23, 31). Bloomfield (1934) said that
English writing system is conservative and some word spell-
ing archaic and so ingrained that people are reluctant to
reform them. "Sounds which existed when our spelling
became habitual, but have since been lost by linguistic
change, are still represented in our writing by silent letters, as
in name, know, gnat, bought, would." (p. 292). Firth (1937)
also stated that "English spelling is so preposterously unsys-
tematic that some sort of reform is undoubtedly necessary in
the interest of the whole world" (p. 48). Many years after
Firth's statement, Jowitt (2008) reechoed his advice by
observing that the vocabulary of English "is vast and con-
stantly expanding, but its grammar contains many anomalies
and its spelling is notoriously irregular. Perhaps one day the
international community will insist on its reform." (p. 1). In
the same vein, Bezrukova (2003) decried English spelling
thus:
English spelling is so hopeless at representing phonemes that a
reform based on virtually any accent would be an improvement
for everyone elsewhere. For instance, words like psychology are
pronounced by no one as/psychology/. If we were to spell the
<ps> as <s> and <ch> as <k>, we could get/sykology/, which is
closer to everyone's pronunciation. Then there are words with
<ph> like photograph where everyone says /f/. (p. 1 )
Yule (1991b) also held this view. In a second language
situation, like Nigeria, English spelling system is a serious
challenge to writing, reading, teaching, and learning. Some
studies have shown how differences in pronunciation and
spelling wrongly influence each other: Nigerians pronounce
some words as spelt and spell them as pronounced. This
habit often leads to misspelling and mispronunciation
(Awonusi, 2007; Onose, 2003; Schmied, 1991; Soneye,
2008).
Spelling errors that writers often commit are categorized
into four types. These are (a) addition of letters, for example,
harrassment for harassment; (b) deletion of letters such as
embarasment for embarrassment; (c) replacement or substi-
tution as in using the affix -ant for -ent, for example, super-
intendant for superintendent; and (d) reversing the order of
spelling, for example, feaces for faeces (Crystal, 2005,
p. 213). A fifth type common in ESL is the mixture of the
four types; for instance, this one taken from a student script:
buorgioesie for bourgeoisie.
As there are many inconsistencies in the English spelling
system, which constrain writers to commit the above-
mentioned categories of misspelling at all levels, many lin-
guists have made a clarion call for the reform of the English
spelling system, thereby generating arguments for and against
the call. Spelling reform is often suggested in two ways: a
standardized, regular use of the existing letters of the alphabet
and a more radical reform like the one of new and additional
letters proposed by Bernard Shaw (Crystal, 2005, p. 215).
The Arguments Against Spelling Reform
Even though many people agree that spelling reform is desir-
able, it has been argued that it will cause orthographic confu-
sion in teaching and learning, discontinuity and conflict
between new and old spellings, and the massive new printing
of old works to reflect new spellings. It has been argued that
rigorous and effective teaching and drills in spelling can
eliminate or minimize confusion (Chomsky & Halle, 1968).
Chomsky and Halle (1968) traced failure in spelling to the
fact that English spelling system is taught as a faulty phone-
mic representation instead of as a mixed level system (Baker,
1980).
In addition to these challenges are people's attitude to
new concepts and innovations. Many people are so conserva-
tive that once they are used to a particular way of doing
things, they vigorously resist any attempt to introduce a new
way. This is why people resist or argue against spelling
reform.
When the art of writing becomes well established in a
community, not only the spellings of words but even lexical
and grammatical forms become conventional for written
records. This conservatism, as time goes on, works in another
way: The conventions of writing remain unaltered even
though the speech-forms have undergone linguistic change
(Bloomfield, 1934, pp. 291-292).
Another aspect of attitude is lack of unanimity among the
exponents and prospective beneficiaries of spelling reform.
The questions invariably are (a) Whose model should be
Ekundayo 5
used? (b) which type of reform ought to be carried out, a
radical one or a regularized type? and (c) which processes
and procedures should be adopted? Furthermore, attitudes
resulting from people's accent may lead to the tendency of
generating different spellings to reflect different accents.
Arguments for Spelling Reform
On the other side, many socio-educational, economic, and
sociolinguistic merits are often given to strengthen the argu-
ments for spelling reform. One of them is that spelling reform
will make spelling easier for both children and adults.
Reformed and regularized spelling will help slow learners to
learn faster. Regularized spellings which eliminate redun-
dant letters and superfluous sound clusters will certainly
save the time of writing both manually and mechanically. By
extension, the cost of typing, stationery, and logistics will
also be drastically reduced. Above all, for the second lan-
guage users of this study, spelling reform will be of huge
benefit to reading, writing, as well as teaching and learning
reading and spelling.
The arguments of discontinuity between old and new
spellings, which a reformed spelling system will engender,
conservatism and having to embark on the printing of old
books to reflect new spellings and attitudes are not water-
tight. Sometimes in life, discontinuity between the old and
the new is inevitable. In the case of spelling reform, there
need not be discontinuity, as feared by critics, because many
cases of differences of spelling abound in Middle and
Modern English, which we recognize. They do not truncate
learning; for example, in King James Bible English, say, do,
run, and so on are spelt as sayeth, doeth, and runneth. We do
recognize them as Elizabethan or King James English
spellings.
Also, spending huge resources to reprint old books as a
result of reformed spellings would be absolutely unnecessary
because we do not have to reprint old books to reflect new
spellings. New editions of old books will have to do that. The
transition from the old to the new spelling system will auto-
matically become part of the knowledge that we transmit to
the next generation. Confusion should not arise from this. All
considered, even at present, people learn and use all different
types of spellings: normal spellings with the letters of the
alphabet, shorthand, technographic (as in computer and spe-
cial fields) and cryptographic spellings, as in secret intelli-
gence organizations and cults. In usage, writers are able to
separate these various spelling systems. So, a reform of the
small part of confused spellings in English cannot generate
confusion or necessitate the reprinting of old books.
According to Crystal (2005),
A widely cited figure is that English is about 75% regular. On
the other hand, the 400 or so irregular spellings are largely
among the most frequently used words in the language, and this
promotes a strong impression of irregularity. (p. 214)
Well, if the 400 most regularly used English words are
irregularly spelt, they must logically create a huge picture of
a confused spelling system, which ought to be reformed to
increase the percentage of regularity from 75% to 100% or
more than 90%.
On conservatism, the point must be made that people have
always been conservative. Conservatism is part of human
nature. However, a new concept or innovation that has inher-
ent values for the general good of all and the spirit of learn-
ing must be pursued and realized with greater tenacity. The
fact that many reform attempts have been made in the past
with some results shows that spelling reform is worthwhile
and portends great hopes for future reform attempts.
As for the argument of not teaching orthography as "a
mixed level system" but as "a faulty phonemic representa-
tion," it should be borne in mind that no amount of effective
teaching of orthography can erase the obvious mismatch
between phonemic representation and spellings. Indeed, a
number of studies have shown that teaching reading and
writing and reading generally by adults and children will be
easier in reformed spellings (Seymour, 2001; Upward, 1995;
Yule, 1991a). Yule (1991a), for instance, said that "experi-
ments over the last 150 years have shown that English-
speaking children could learn to read more easily in reformed
spelling than in traditional orthography" (p. 168). Besides,
Yule (1991b) has asked a pertinent question in this regard,
which she has also answered confidently: "Does the nature
of English spelling handicap learners of literacy more than
other writing systems trouble their novices? The obvious
answer to me, from observation and experience, is yes."
Some Major Attempted and Suggested Reforms
Following are some spelling reform attempts and sugges-
tions since the 16th century:
1569: John Hart wrote Orthographie, a book on English
spelling.
1580: The publication of A Book at Large for the
Amendment of English Orthographie by William
Bullokar.
1621: Logonomia Anglican on orthography by Dr.
Alexandra Gill, headmaster of St Paul's School,
London.
1634: English Grammar by Charles Butler's, containing
the examination of syntax and orthography.
These individual efforts proposed radical reforms of the
English spelling system. However, some other works pro-
posed conservative or mild reform based on the extant
system:
1662: In the Neoclassical period, James Howell in his
book Grammar suggested minor changes, such as
logique to logic, warre to war, sinne to sin, toune to
6 SAGE Open
town, and so on; interestingly, some of his suggested
spellings were adopted and are still being used today.
1755: The publication of A Dictionary of the English
Language by Samuel Johnson, an epochal intellectual
work in the Age of Sensibility and Standardization,
which regularized and preserved the spellings and
meanings of English words that are still current.
1806: Witnessed a major effort by Noah Webster: the
publication of A Comprehensive Dictionary of the
English Language, which has an essay on spelling
reform and rules.
1828: Another landmark effort by Webster: An American
Dictionary of the English Language with American
spellings.
1837: Isaac Pitman's Phonetic Shorthand, which intro-
duced a new system of symbols and spelling still stud-
ied and used in secretarial courses and writing
minutes.
1848:Alexandra John Ellis's A Plea for Phonetic Spelling,
which suggested radical changes and the harmoniza-
tion of spelling and phonetics.
1870: The Philological Societies of Great Britain and
America examined the challenge of the English spell-
ing system.
1876, August: International Convention for the
Amendment of English Orthography was held in
Philadelphia. Thereafter, America Philological Society
took a list of 12 reformed spellings for immediate use:
are- ar, give- giv, have- hav, live- liv, though- tho,
through- thru.
Coincidently, this is the way a variety of Nigerian written
communication writes these words, that is, SMS: text
messages.
1884: The publication of the augmented Roman alphabet
known as "phonotype" by Isaac Pitman (1813-1897).
1876: The Spelling Reform Association (SRA) was
founded in the United States.
1906: Simplified Spelling Board (SSB) was constituted in
the United States.
Theodore Roosevelt, the then U.S. president, instructed
the "Government Printing Office" to start using the reformed
spellings by SSB. However, the U.S. Congress stopped the
changes. Yet, some of the changed spellings survived: anae-
mia/anæmia to anemia, mould to mold, catalogue to catalog,
and so on.
1908: Simplified Spelling Society (SBB) formed in
Britain.
1920: SSB published A Handbook of Simplified Spelling,
containing some spelling reform rules. The Board
encouraged writers to use the new spellings. But SBB
could not stand the test of time.
1949: The SBB published New Spelling and presented it
as a bill to the British Parliament. The bill nearly suc-
ceeded: 84 members of Parliament voted for it whereas
87 voted against it. So, it was rejected.
1953: The new Spelling Bill was re-presented to the
British Parliament and it scaled through the first read-
ing, but it was again withdrawn as a result of opposi-
tion from the Ministry of Education (Crystal, 2005, pp.
214-216; Kimball, n.d.; Reilly, 2010; Wikipedia, n.d.;
Yule, 1991b).
1969: Harry Lindgren's proposed Spelling Reform (SR1)
succeeded inAustralia. It was adopted by theAustralian
Government and widely used by Australians. The
reform eliminated redundant letters in some words.
Friend became frend, health became helth, early
became erly, and so on. However, it was not sustained
because the succeeding government after its adoption
was not favorably disposed to Lindgren's SR1.
(Sources: Alexandra, 1969; Baugh & Cable, 1978;
Crystal, 2009; Yule, 1991a, 1991b; www.spelling-soci-
ety.org/bulletins/aextra1.php).
There are many other individuals and institutional
attempts and proposals on spelling reforms at different times.
The few efforts that succeeded, like Harry Lindgren's SR1
and the American experience, clearly indicate that English
spellings can be regularized. American spelling reform,
which was based on the rules by Noah Webster (1758-1843),
regularized the spellings of many words and discarded some
redundant letters and silent sound; for example, <-our> is
spelt <-or> as in labour for labor, <ph> is spelt <f> as in
sulfur for sulphur, <-ae-> is spelt <e> as encyclopedia for
encyclopaedia, silent <-ue> at the end of a word after a con-
sonant is dropped as in catalog for catalogue, and so on.
Also, SMS text message and email variety of written English
is proving convincingly that spelling can be reformed in
some ways.
NE and Spelling Variations
The general consensus among Nigerian linguists at present is
that NE does exist and flourish. There are expressions one
hears everywhere that one goes and at all levels that are
proudly NE:
There is absolutely no doubt that Nigerian English does exhibit
the characteristics demanded by Kachru, NE has come of age
and its recognition as an international variety is a foregone
conclusion. What is left is a detailed description of its features
and a clear statements [sic] from norm setters that due recognition
be given to it. This will eliminate the self-consciousness that
accompanies usage that has a distinctive Nigerian flavour.
(Dadzie & Awonusi, 2009, p. 96)
It should be added that the detailed description of its fea-
tures must include variations of spelling in ENE; for
Ekundayo 7
example, many educated Nigerians spell accommodation as
accomodation or acomodation, pronunciation as pronounci-
ation, embarrassment as embarasment, embarassment, and
so on. There are many others that can be treated as variations
of spelling because Nigerians have extenuating sociolinguis-
tic backdrops for these spellings. Acomodation, for instance,
eliminates redundant letters and saves time. Pronounciation
reflects the correct spelling of its stem, which is pronounce.
The Great Spelling "Shift": Who Bells the Spelling
Cat and How?
There ought to be a Great Spelling Shift. If the English spell-
ing system is a wild cat that intimidates and confuses chil-
dren and writers, then we have to bell it. But who bells the
cat in Nigerian and other Englishes and how? Belling the cat
through spelling reform is not impossible or as difficult as
some people think. The challenges in this regard are adamant
conservatism and the lack of the educational and political
will to do it. Once norm setters are determined to pursue it to
its desired conclusion, it would be achieved. The near suc-
cess of the British attempt in 1949 and 1953, respectively,
should be an impetus and the three procedures for spelling
reform in the bill could yet be adopted. There were three
stages in the said bill:
First, reformed spelling system was to be introduced into
primary school curriculum and be taught for 5 years, after
which the teaching of old spelling would stop. Second, in the
following 5 years, new spellings would be introduced man-
datorily into the media, films, and public announcement.
Third, new spellings would be compulsory after 10 years in
public documents, literatures, and copy right materials. For
our purpose, these procedures can be adopted and
Nigerianized for NE in the following ways:
The Nigerian Academy of Letters (NAL), Nigeria English
Studies Association (NESA), Linguistic Association of
Nigeria (LAN), and English Learning and Teaching
Association of Nigeria (ELTAN), among other professional
bodies, should spearhead the campaign for spelling reform.
The campaign and the entire processes should be funded by
the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Ministry of
Education with which NESA should work as partners for
educational advancement. Where the Federal Government is
unwilling, NAL and NESA could undertake the project and
source for funding from the Nigerian public and willing indi-
viduals. The team of scholars on the International Corpus of
English (ICE) NE Codification Project should make it part of
their terms of reference to look into the nativization or the
reform of spelling in NE. NESA should sensitize and liaise
with other sister professional bodies like the Literary Society
of Nigeria (LSN), National Association of Teachers and
Researchers in English as a Second Language (NATRESL),
NigeriaMedicalAssociation(NMA),NigeriaBarAssociation
(NBA), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Union
of Teachers (NUT), among others. Once the criteria, rules,
and aspects of the reform have been determined, they should
be introduced to the curricula of schools at all levels and
should be seriously taught and publicized.
The print and electronic media, Nigerian "Home Video,"
also known as Nollywood, should be used to heavily publi-
cize the new spellings of the words affected; for example,
newspaper editorials and headlines should be written in
reformed spelling. In no time, the reform will sink into the
minds of NE writers. Luckily enough, the English spelling
system is already reforming itself in the new variety of email
and cell phone (textese and emailese) where all redundant
letters and unnecessary repetitions of letters are completely
eliminated without compromising meanings. Spelling reform
can draw some examples from Nigerian SMS and email
varieties.
Is Spelling Reform Indeed Necessary?
This article shows that educated Nigerians agree that English
spelling system is confusing and irregular and therefore
should be reformed. In addition toAmerican spelling alterna-
tives, English spelling system should be reformed to elimi-
nate redundant letters, unnecessary repetition of letters and
clusters, regularize digraph, and to spell compound words in
one way only.
Analysis
One thousand questionnaires were administered in the
University of Benin in 2011. Fifty copies of the question-
naire were shared to lecturers in English and Literature,
Linguistics, Foreign Languages and International Studies,
and Diplomacy Departments of the University of Benin,
Benin City, Nigeria. The remainders were administered to
English and Literature students 100 to 400 levels, University
of Benin in September, 2011. All the 800 respondents who
returned their questionnaires admitted that the English spell-
ing system is in part confusing and therefore clearly sug-
gested spelling reform. They also prefer the American
spelling system which is simpler than British spelling in
some words and proposed that in addition to American spell-
ing, further reform should be embarked on in NE. Following
are some of the American spellings which respondents
prefer:
Deletion of Redundant Consonants and Vowels
British American
-our: labour, saviour, favour labor, savior, favor
-ae: faeces, caesarian feces, cesarian
-ue: catalogue, analogue catalog, analog
-ise: organize, realize organize, realize
-ll-: shrivelled, travelling shrivel, travel
-re: centre, spectre, metre center, specter, meter
-mme: programme program
-hy: rhyme rime
-que: cheque check, etc
8 SAGE Open
With the use of computer and ease of spelling these words,
many educated Nigerians now mix-up these American spell-
ings with British spellings, which are taught to them
regularly.
Elimination of Redundant and Unnecessary
Letters in English Spelling
All letters and combination of letters that are of no morpho-
logical and semantic significance should be deleted, as done
in textese. Any silent letter that is not relevant in distinguish-
ing forms, synonyms, homophones, and showing nuances of
similar forms and derivatives, should be dropped, for exam-
ple, know contains two silent letters, but the silent letters may
not be dropped because their presence distinguishes know
from no and now. However, in knowledge, the <w>, <d>
and the last <e> can be dropped to have knoleg/knolej, which
is easier to spell. The last <e> in complete and rage are silent
and so could be dropped. But a critical look will discover that
the <e> of rage performs an orthographic function because if
the <e> is dropped, rage will become rag. The same thing
cannot be said of the last <e> in complete, which can be done
away with. Other examples are given below:
If the deletion of a seemingly redundant letter or group of
letters make the resultant word appear like another, thereby
creating confusion, then the letters should be retained; for
example, deleting the redundant -r- in these words will create
confusion: art, dart, tar, cart. Similarly, the underlined silent
letters in the following words are functional, as they distin-
guish them from close homophones: whole, where, whose,
write, sow, knight, lamb, and so on.
Unnecessary Repetition of Letters
Repetition of letters and consonant clusters also make
English spelling confusing. Therefore, all repetitions and
clusters that are not affixes but mere repetitions just for the
sake of spelling should be deleted. Care should be taken to
differentiate between functional repetition and useless repe-
tition. For example, unnecessary and tunnel have double
<n>, respectively. While the double <nn> in unnecessary is
as a result of the addition of the prefix un- to necessary, and
so functional, the <nn> in tunnel is mere repetition.Therefore,
one can be dropped to have tunel. Following are more
examples:

Repeated vowels are not as problematic as consonant
clusters. That is why they are not well represented here
because double vowels can be pronounced as one long vowel
or diphthong, for example, food, soup, soap, but double con-
sonants have only a short pronunciation.
Regularization of Monograph and Digraph
A digraph is a combination of two or more different letters
pronounced as one phoneme. In spelling, a digraph comes as
two or more letters combined, but in transcription, the two
letters are represented by a phonetic symbol and pronounced
as a phoneme; for example, <ph> and <ch>, which are pro-
nounced as /f/, /k/, /t/ or //, respectively. Digraph can be
regularized to simplify spelling:
Finally, in this subsection, there are monographs and a par-
tial vowel which create problems for educated Nigerians.
These are letter <x> and the partial vowel /j/. Letter <x> is
often realized in two phonemes during articulation, and the
partial vowel /j/ is often absent in spelling. These two are of a
kind because the former <x> has a phoneme absent in spelling
but present in pronunciation and the latter /j/ too is sometimes
absent in spelling but there in pronunciation. Nigerians do take
the -x- for a phoneme and articulate it accordingly and where
/j/ should be pronounced, it is usually not pronounced because
of its absence in spelling. Therefore, the monograph <x>
should be regularized to the two letters it represents during
spelling so that readers are in no doubt about its correct pro-
nunciation. The implication is that the letter <x>, apart from
just appearing in spelling and in the alphabet, is basically use-
less for articulation for most educated Nigerians:
Similarly, the phoneme /j/ should be represented in the
spelling of words in NE. The letter <i> or <y> can be used to
reflect it, depending on how it can blend well
morpho-phonemically:
Now, we look at complication in the spelling of com-
pound and reduplicated words.
Compound Word Spelling
A compound word is a combination of two base forms or two
words functioning as one entity with a meaning. Although
we have two or more words in a compound formation, the
two words together denote one thing, idea or concept.
Reduplication is the repetition of similar sound and spelling
but not different bases; for example, hocus-pocus, hanky-
panky. There are three ways of writing compound words,
which create confusion for writers: combined or solid form
(as in breakfast), separated or open form (e.g., cassava
flower), and hyphenated form (e.g., brother-in-law). Because
compound words and their origins are very many, writers do
not often know during writing which is which. So, the three
rules of writing them are generally mixed up.

Table 1. (continued)
In a questionnaire administered to 25,000 educated
Nigerians who were mainly lecturers and final year students
in English and Literature, Linguistics, and International
Studies and Diplomacy, Mass Communication and Theatre
Arts Department, all the responses collated and analyzed
(10,000 in all) admitted misspelling some words and mixing
up the 3 ways in which compound words are spelt.
Furthermore, the 22 compound words dictated for them to
spell were spelt indiscriminately in any of the three above-
given ways. Table 1 (S/No. 1) shows how the 22 compound
words dictated were spelt. (A) is SBE.
The table shows a clear preference for the combined and
hyphenated compound words in ENE.Asked to state how best
they think compound words should be written to avoid confu-
sion, the respondents suggested one-way rule only. Five thou-
sand eight hundred (58%) suggested the hyphenated type,
whereas 4,200 (42%) proposed the combined form. All con-
sidered, it makes no difference to meaning and it scarcely
affects pronunciation if a compound word is written in any of
the three forms. Quirk, Greebaum, Leech, and Svatvik (1985)
have also acknowledged the inconsistencies that characterize
writing compound words. At times, a compound formation is
acceptably written in the three ways possible; for example, "a
flower pot, a flower-pot, a flowerpot." Furthermore, they
observe that hyphenation is more common in BrE than in
AmE, that in AmE, compound words tend to be written more
in combined form (Greebaum, Leech, and Svatvik, 1985, p.
1569). The implication is that the writing of compound words
lacks consistency and uniformity in the two most popular
English models of the world. Therefore, the suggestion of our
respondents presented below should be adopted. Either A or B
(as shown below) can be adopted for writing all compound
words in all contexts, instead of the three ways in which they
can occur, which confuse even the most conscious of writers:
Conclusion
This article deals with the perennial challenge of the
confusing English spelling system and the necessity of
spelling reform. It was found that even the most versatile
and seemingly perfect of scholars do misspell words or
get confused about the correct spelling of a word when
writing. They inevitably consult a dictionary, if it is
available, or use a synonym, or ignorantly misspell the
word. All considered, misspelling does not alter meaning
but only shows that the writer does not know the correct
spelling of the word. Although this is the case, variations
of spelling are regarded by educated Nigerians as clear
errors that must be penalized and discouraged. Despite
concerted efforts to SBE-fy spellings in NE, educated
Nigerians who keep misspelling some words agree that
spelling reform is expedient. To this end, different sug-
gested spellings have been made here. Reform should
formulate rules for deleting redundant letters, unneces-
sary sound clusters, regularizing digraph, and spelling
compound words in one way only, as illustrated in this
article. The kind of reform proposed here will enhance
spelling skills and accuracy, reading, and writing, and
will relate written English very closely with
pronunciation.

in front.
i.____________________________________
ii.____________________________________
iii.____________________________________
iv.____________________________________
v.____________________________________
5. Why did you misspell these words?
 Lack of concentration [ ]. I did not remember the spellings [ ]. The spellings are confusing to me [ ]. I am bad at
spelling [ ]. It was a slip of the pen [ ].

7. If yes, list five words that you still misspell and in exactly the way you spell them.
i.___________________________________
ii.___________________________________
iii.___________________________________
iv.___________________________________
v.___________________________________
8.
Based on your response from 1 to 6 above, would you support a reform in English spelling for Nigerian English usage/
use? Yes [ ]. No [ ].
9. List four ways or areas in which you want English spelling reformed or reorganized?
i._______________________________________________
ii._______________________________________________
iii._______________________________________________
iv._______________________________________________
10.Is English spelling, at least in part, an irrational and inadequate system for representing spoken English? You may not
personally agree with this. Do you? Yes [ ]. No [ ].
11. Spelling compound words (blocked, separated, or hyphenated) is sometimes confusing. Do you agree? Yes [ ]. No [ ].
12.
If you say yes, then suggest just one way you think compound words should be spelt to avoid confusion and enhance
the teaching and learning of spelling.
