Used the National Health Interview Survey, Child Health Supplement for 198/
and 1988, to analyze parent-reported behavior problems of children, ages 4-17
years, with cerebral palsy (n = 47), with mental retardation (n = 50), with other
chronic conditions (n = 6,038), and with no known health problem fn = 5,930),
using the Behavior Problem Index (developed by Zill & Peterson). Behaviors
with scores greater than the 90th percentile of the entire sample were considered
problem behaviors. Parent-reported behavior problems were 5 times more likely
in children with cerebral palsy (25.5%) compared with children having no known
health problem (5.4%). The adjusted odds ratio for behavior problems of chil-
dren with cerebral palsy without mental retardation was 4.9 and of children with
mental retardation without cerebral palsy was 7.9. Specific behaviors that were
most problematicfor children with cerebral palsy were identified as dependency,
headstrong, and hyperactive.

This analysis uses an epidemiological approach to assess the association between
behavior problems and cerebral palsy (CP) in children. Epidemiology is the
study of diseases in populations rather than in individuals. To assess the impact
of cerebral palsy on the population, we analyzed the association between cerebral

palsy and behavior problems using a national data source. Drotar (1994) ad-
dressed the issue of limited generalizability when clinic-based studies are used to
study pediatric patients. Bias occurs because researchers miss eligible children
and families who live within the catchment area but do not get included in the
study. This population-based analysis, of a nationally representative sample of
American children, provides data to address Drotar's criticism of past clinic-
based studies.
The term cerebral palsy refers to a nonprogressive motor disorder, with
resultant tonal and/or movement abnormalities and frequently associated disabil-
ities, that follows damage to an immature brain. Overall, CP prevalence by early
school age is approximately 1.2-2.3/1,000 children (Cowan, Leviton, &
Nelson, 1992; Nelson, 1989). Recent analysis indicates the prevalence has in-
creased in the United States by 20% during the period 1960-1986 (Bhushan,
Paneth, & Kiely, 1993). This increase is believed to be based on the increased
survival of very low birth weight infants (Taft & Matthews, 1992). However,
these authors still estimate a prevalence of 2.3/1,000 live births, which is in
keeping with the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Study of
school age children (Yeargin-Allsop et al., 1992).
Epidemiological studies of CP have been widely published and reviewed
during the past 10 years. The majority of these studies have addressed risk
factors for development of CP (Stanley, 1984; Stanley & Blair, 1994). Little
epidemiological research has explored the question of whether, and to what
degree, children with CP experience behavior problems. Behavior problems are
commonly reported by parents of children with disabilities, as well as by their
physicians and educators. We chose to address this question using a large (N =
23,586) nationally representative survey, the 1981 and 1988 National Health
Interview Survey (NH1S) Child Health Supplement. This data set is particularly
appropriate to address the question of behavior problems in children with CP
compared to those without CP as these data include children based on their
parent's address and not dependent on whether they attend a specific clinic. The
parents were asked a range of questions, including their child's health status
(chronic and acute health problems) and their report of behavior problems. The
focus of this ongoing national survey supplement is to estimate the prevalence of
health problems in children.
Selection bias may be a problem with clinical studies in which subjects with
CP are selected as cases and those without CP are sampled from another clinic
(presumably with another health problem). Those included as CP cases, who
attend clinics, may have more significant health problems either associated with
CP or with other comorbidities, than do children with CP who do not regularly
attend clinics. Selection bias may also affect a comparison group of children
without CP sampled from other clinics. These children may have other health
problems that may result in an increased probability that they may develop
Behavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 449
behavior problems. This inappropriate comparison may result in underestimating
the true association between CP and behavior problems. By using the NHIS
Child Health Supplement we eliminate this bias by including children sampled
from their communities and not from clinics.
Theoretical Framework for Hypotheses
Our analysis of a national data set focuses on the occurrence of behavior
problems in children with CP. We believe the presence of a physical disability is
compounded by social and emotional challenges. The causal pathway for the
development of emotional and behavior problems is not clear. It is possible that
emotional problems are the inevitable comorbidities of specific conditions of
childhood. It is also possible that some of the behavior problems are preventable.
To establish whether the behavior problems are preventable we must first deter-
mine if children with specific chronic health conditions have different behavior
problems or different magnitudes of these problems. With this understanding we
will be able to design prevention interventions.
There is a notable progression in the magnitude of the association between
behavior problems and health conditions as we move from episodic to chronic
and from non-central nervous system (CNS) to CNS-involved conditions. For
over 20 years researchers have reported a positive association of childhood
chronic conditions and behavior problems (Breslau, 1985; Breslau & Marshall,
1985; Cadman, Boyle, Szatamari, & Offord, 1987; Pless & Roghmann, 1971).
Researchers have reported stress, anxiety, and limited contacts with peers, re-
lated to childhood diabetes, rheumatic disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, sickle
cell anemia, and asthma (Billings, Moos, Miller, & Gottlieb, 1987; Daniels,
Moos, Billings, & Miller, 1987; Noll, Bukowski, Rogosch, LeRoy, & Kulkarni,
1990; Steinhausen, 1988; Varni, Bebani, Banis, & Wilcox, 1988; Wicks-Nelson
& Israel, 1991). Wallander et al. (1988) used maternal reports on the Child
Behavior Checklist and found that children with chronic physical disorders had
more behavior problems than control children although the magnitude of their
behavior problems was not very severe. It appears that emotional adjustment is
associated with the severity of the condition and the degree of functional limita-
tions experienced by the child (Billings et al., 1987; Fowler, Johnson, & Atkin-
son, 1985). Gortmaker, Walker, Weitzman, and Sobol (1990) analyzed the 1981
NHIS Child Health Supplement to assess the effect of chronic conditions and
socioeconomic factors on behavior problems in children, ages 4--17 years. Their
results indicate that "rates of extreme behavior problem scores (those in the top
10th percentile) were 1.55 times higher among children with a chronic health
condition compared to children without a chronic health condition (95% confi-
dence interval of 1.29 to 1.86)." This result suggests that chronic conditions are a
risk factor for behavior problems independent of socioeconomic factors.
450 McDennott et al.
The literature on chronic conditions in children also includes studies of
children with CNS conditions. Cadman et al. (1987) compared social and school
adjustment of children with chronic illness alone to children with chronic illness
and disability. The latter group, which included children with CNS impairments,
had more significant problems. Similar results were reported by Howe, Fein-
stein, Reiss, Molock, and Berger (1993). They found that children with chronic
illness without CNS involvement were more like the comparison children than
children with CNS conditions. Likewise, Weiland, Pless, and Roghmann (1992)
found that primary care providers were significantly more likely to report that
children with serious conditions involving the CNS had behavior problems
whereas those without CNS involvement were not reported to be significantly
different from normal children. These studies indicate that children with a dis-
ability involving the CNS are at increased risk for behavior problems compared
to children with other types of chronic conditions.
Since CP is a subset of chronic CNS conditions we reviewed the literature to
determine if there are reports on the severity of the problem or specific behavioral
domains affecting children with CP. The prevalence of behavioral problems in
children with CP and the nature of these problems have been reviewed by a
number of researchers. The prevalence of disturbed behaviors or emotional mal-
adaptations in different groups of children with CP have been reported to be from
30-80% (Denhoff & Holden, 1954; Graham & Rutter, 1968b; Hourcade &
Parette, 1984; McDonald, 1987; Rosenbloom, 1971; Storrow & Jones, 1960).
The stability of behavior problems over time was described by Breslau and
Marshall (1985) in a 5-year study of 255 children with physical disabilities. They
found that mentation problems (items related to short-term memory and school
performance) and isolation were consistent and significant problems for the 82
children with cerebral palsy. In school-age children with CP, other researchers
have found behavioral problems including passivity, immaturity, and anxiety
(Graham & Rutter, 1968b; Haslett, 1978; Hourcade & Parette, 1984; Rosen-
bloom, 1971). Based on the literature and our clinical experience we anticipated
that issues related to isolation and dependency could be problematic for children
with CP (Blum, Resnick, Nelson, & St. Germaine, 1991; Breslau, 1983; Hirst,
1989; Livneh & Antonak, 1994).
In addition, we felt it was important to analyze the independent association
of mental retardation (MR) and CP and behavior problems as well as the com-
bined effect. Murphy, Yeargin-Allsopp, Decoufle, and Drews (1993) analyzed
the population-based Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Study and
reported that 65% of the children with CP had MR. This confirmed our clinical
impression that these two conditions were often highly associated. Thus, since
both MR and CP are CNS conditions it would be beneficial to compare the
behavior problems associated with the two conditions.
The behavior categories used in our analysis were selected by Zill (1990)
Behavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 451
who "tapped some of the more common behavior syndromes in young people."
The same scale has been used in several published articles and the problem
behavior factors identified in this study are consistent with those in the literature
(Breslau & Marshall, 1985; Graham & Rutter, 1968a; Haslett, 1978, Hourcade
& Parette, 1984; Rosenbloom, 1971).
This study provides an analysis of data from the NHIS. It was designed to
answer the question: Are behavior problems identified by parents of children
with cerebral palsy in a nonclinical setting? The specific hypotheses that were
tested are:
1. Children with CP have more behavior problems than children with no
chronic or acute health conditions.
2. Children with MR have more behavior problems than children with no
chronic or acute health conditions.
METHODS
The data for this analysis were obtained from the 1981 and 1988 NHIS
Child Health Supplement. The NHIS is a U.S. sample survey conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics since 1957. The survey staff conduct in-
person interviews with approximately 40,000 households. Information in the
NHIS includes reports by adults about their health and the health status of their
children as it relates to acute and chronic conditions and health services utiliza-
tion. Supplements to the NHIS focus on special populations and health concerns.
The 1981 and 1988 supplements focused on child health and included the Behav-
ior Problem Index (BP1; Zill, 1990). The 1981 survey includes 11,746 children
and the 1988 survey includes 11,840 children whose parents responded about
their children's behavior on the BPI. Children 4-17 years of age, whose parents
reported that they had a diagnosis of CP, were selected as cases. The same
procedure was used to obtain children with MR, and children with other chronic
health conditions (CHC). CHCs included chronic respiratory, cardiovascular,
glandular, digestive, or other chronic conditions, excluding CP and MR. The
comparison group throughout the analysis was children without any chronic or
acute health condition. We could only assess which behavioral problems were
associated with CP unconfounded by the presence of MR for the 1981 survey
because the 1988 survey did not specify MR presence. The distinct category of
MR was not included in the problem list read to parents for the 1988 interview.
Instead children with MR were included in a broad coding category of neurologic
conditions. Therefore, a subanalysis was conducted on the 1981 survey in which
children with CP (and no MR) and those with MR (and no CP) we re compared to
children having no chronic or acute diseases to assess their relative frequency of
behavioral problems.
452 McDermott et al.
We first assessed behavioral problems among all children with CP compared
to children with no health conditions. There were 47 children with CP, 50
children with MR, 6,038 children with some chronic health condition excluding
CP and MR, and 5,930 children with no acute or CHC. We combined the
children with CP from the 1981 and the 1988 surveys in order to increase the
number of cases. We felt this was justified since the diagnosis of CP is often
made before a diagnosis of MR can be ruled out. This second analysis, with a
mixed groups of children with CP, is useful since it represents an actual group of
children with CP selected from the population.
Measurement Instrument
Behavioral problems were assessed in the NHIS Child Health Supplement
using a 28-item BPl based on parent report. The Index was developed by Zill and
Peterson, based on numerous preexisting instruments (Achenbach & Edelbrock,
1981; Graham & Rutter, 1968a; Kellam, Branch, Agorwal, & Ensminger, 1975;
Langner et al., 1976; Rutter, Tizard, & Whitmore, 1970; National Center for
Health Statistics, 1971). The high reliability of the scale has been reviewed by
numerous researchers (Gortmaker et al., 1990; McCormick, Gortmaker, &
Sobol, 1990; Peterson & Zill, 1986; Zill, 1988). Gortmaker etal. (1990) reported
their validation of the BPl based on its ability to discriminate between children
who were and were not referred for clinical help.
Parents were asked to report the frequency with which their children exhib-
ited a range of behavioral problems. Weighted scores were obtained for response
categories by assigning 2 (often true), I (sometimes true), and 0 (not true). We
used the procedure described by Gortmaker et al. (1990) for dichotomizing the
behavior variables into the children in the bottom 90th percentile and those in the
top 10th percentile. Gortmaker et al. reported validity of the BPl and the 1981
NHIS for children with chronic health conditions by correlating the scores on the
BPl with parental reports of the child ever seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist, or
psychoanalyst (r = .28). We repeated this method of validation for the 1981 and
1988 children with CP, using our weighted scores, and found a significant
correlation between the BPl scores and receipt of mental health services (r =
0.42, p = .0001). We found that overall, 10.7% of the children in the sample
received mental health services. Among those children who score in the top 10th
percentile of the BPl, 49% got mental health services. Only 7% of all other
children received mental health services. The 90th percentile corresponds to a
score of 13 or more for the 1981 survey and to a score of 15 or more for the
combined surveys using sometimes true or often true responses to behavior
problems. The cutoff scores for dichotomizing the specific behaviors, for 1981
and the combined surveys, were antisocial 2.0 and 3.0, anxiety 3.0 and 4.0,
Behavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 453
headstrong 5.0 and 5.0, hyperactive 4.0 and 4.0, peer conflict 1.0 and 1.0, and
dependency 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Thus, the case definition for having a
behavior problem was established by high scores on the subset behaviors. In fact,
at a minimum, a behavior problem was defined as having sometimes true re-
sponses at least once for peer conflict, at least twice for dependency and antiso-
cial, at least three times for anxiety, at least four times for hyperactive, and at
least five times for headstrong. This weighting was used for all of the procedures
described in the statistical analyses. The period of reference for reporting was the
previous 3 months.
The item composition of the Behavior Problem Index (all items) is as
follows: Antisocial: cheats or tells lies, bullies, cruel or mean; disobedient at
school; not sorry after misbehaving; trouble getting along with teachers (5 items);
Anxious/Depressed: sudden changes in mood; feels unloved; too fearful or anx-
ious; feels worthless; unhappy, sad, depressed (5 items); Headstrong: high
strung; argues too much; disobedient at home; stubborn, sullen; very strong
temper (5 items); Hyperactive: cannot concentrate; easily confused; impulsive;
obsessive; restless (5 items); Immature/Dependent: (4-11 years only) clings to
adults only, cries a lot, demands a lot of attention, too dependent on others (4
items); Peer ConflictISocial Withdrawal: has trouble getting along with other
children; not liked by other children; withdrawn (3 items).
Statistical Analysis
The scores were calculated for the subscales and for a composite variable
"any problems," for the total sample, and for the subsets of the sample. The
scores were weighted by the frequency of occurrence reported by the parent. The
"any problem" variable was created by summing the subset scores. Frequency
distributions of demographic factors for the total sample and its subsets were
calculated in order to justify comparisons based on these factors. Chi-square tests
were used to compare the demographic characteristics for children with CP,
children with MR, and children with a CHC excluding CP, and MR (chronic
group) with children with no acute or CHC.
Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios
for the relationship between selected behavioral problems in the three groups of
children (CP, MR, and CHC) and children in the control group. Logistic models
were used because the dependent variable is dichotomous (presence or absence
of a behavior problem) and the independent variable is discrete (CP or control).
We controlled for additional variables (race, gender, age, family structure, region
of the U.S.). The result (odds ratio) can be interpreted as the likelihood of an
outcome given a condition. Thus, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.4 can be interpreted as
a behavior being 2.4 times more likely to have a score greater than the 90th
454 McDermott et al.
percentile of the overall sample, given a child with CP, compared to children in
the survey with no chronic or acute conditions (odds ratio of 1 is neutral).
Scores greater than the 90th percentile from the overall sample mean scores
were used as the cut point for each problem behavior. The following problem
behaviors for the 4- to 17-year-olds were assessed from the BPI: being antisocial,
anxious, headstrong, hyperactive, and having peer conflict. Cases with missing
data for any of the variables were excluded from the logistic regression models.
Race of the child (white, nonwhite), gender of the child (female, male), age of
the child (under 12 years of age, 12 years or older), family intactness (two-parent
homes, single parent or foster care), and geographic region of residence of the
family (northeast, midwest, south, west) were considered potential confounders
in the analyses (the risk groups are italicized). Dependency was assessed for the
4- to 11-year-old children controlling for race, gender, family intactness, and
geographic region of residence.
RESULTS
The prevalence of CP in the 1981 data sample was 1.5/1,000 children (n =
16 children with CP) and was 2.67/1,000 children (n = 31 children with CP) in
the 1988 sample. This increase in prevalence is consistent with the literature
which suggests that survival of very low birth infants increased during the study
period and this increase contributed to an increase in prevalence of CP over time
(Bhushan et al., 1993). We compared the mean behavior scores for the sample of
children with CP and chronic health conditions in 1981 and 1988. For the 1981
survey, the children with CP only mean score was 11.1 (SD 10.3) compared to
children with other chronic conditions mean score of 7.1 (SD 6.7). For the 1988
survey, the children with CP mean score was 9.5 (SD 9.0) compared to children
with other chronic conditions mean score of 7.5 (SD 7.5). This analysis indicates
that the mean scores for the two samples are not statistically different (using t
tests) and can be combined for further analysis. In addition, the mean age for the
combined sample was 11.3 years (SD 3.9), within the range of 4-17 years.
We assessed demographic risk factors for CP, MR, and other chronic condi-
tions in children by comparing the proportion of children in these three groups
(CP n = 47, MR n = 50; other chronic conditions n = 6,038) whose parents
reported the identified demographic factors (child's age, race, gender, region of
residence, and family intactness) with the proportion of controls (those without
CP, MR, or other chronic and acute conditions) reporting these demographic
attributes. Table I presents these comparisons. Compared to controls, those with
CP were more likely to be white (OR = 2.6) and male (OR = 1.9). Younger age
(< 12), region of residence, and family intactness were not significantly associ-
ated with CP. Compared with children having no chronic conditions, those with

with no conditions (5.4%). Of parents of children with CP, 39.3% reported that
dependency was a problem. Being headstrong, hyperactive, anxious, having a
peer group conflict, and being antisocial were also noteworthy problems for
parents of children with CP. Parents of children in the chronic group also report-
ed more behavioral problems than did parents of children in the control group.
Parents of children in the CHC group reported that 6--12% were either head-
strong, hyperactive, dependent, anxious, had peer conflict, or were antisocial.
Table III presents the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association between
having behavioral problems among the groups: the CP group compared to con-
trols and the CHC group compared to controls. Children with CP were 5.3 times
more likely to have any behavioral problem compared with the control group.
The specific problem behaviors disproportionately reported by parents of chil-
dren with CP were anxiety, being headstrong, hyperactivity, having peer group
conflict and being dependent. All odds ratios, except that for being antisocial,
were statistically significant and were adjusted for confounders including the

Children in the CHC group were more than twice as likely to have a behavioral
problem (aOR = 2.5) and were more than twice as likely to be anxious, head-
strong, hyperactive, and be dependent. In addition, children with chronic health
conditions were more likely, compared to controls, to have antisocial behaviors
and peer conflict.
When comparing adjusted odds ratios for children with CP to those of the
CHC group it is clear that children with CP have a much higher risk for behav-
ioral problems. Being dependent and headstrong are the most problematic behav-
iors for children with CP. Since children with CP and MR were not excluded
from the analysis presented in Table III it is possible that those children with both
conditions may be at increased risk of developing behavioral problems indepen-
dent of the CP. For this reason, we conducted a subanalysis to evaluate behav-
ioral problems in children with CP without MR (CP-only group) and those with
MR and no CP (MR-only group) compared with the control group.
Table IV provides the results to suggest that children in the CP-only group
were 4.9 times more likely to have any behavioral problem than the controls.
And the MR-only group were 7.9 times more likely to have any behavioral
problem than the controls. The comparison of the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for
all these groups across the various behavior problems indicate that not all of the
behavior problems identified in Table III could be attributed to CP. Children with
MR were at highest risk for problems in the domains of antisocial, anxiety,
hyperactivity, and peer conflict. Children with CP were at highest risk for prob-
lems in the domains of headstrong and dependent.

We also analyzed the 47 children with CP to assess proxy measures for
severity of their condition. We found that 48.9% of the children with CP (n = 23)
attended special self-contained classrooms and 29.5% received psychiatric ser-
vices. Of the children with CP, 10 went to special school as well as received
psychiatric services. We found that the children with CP had other chronic
conditions or problems: respiratory (14), gastrointestinal (10), circulatory (4),
musculoskeletal (8), sensory (24), and others. In total, 41 of the 47 children with
CP (2 cases in 1981 and 4 cases in 1988 had no other medical condition) had
other impairments or health problems.
DISCUSSION
The primary focus of the present study was to identify behavior problems
associated with CP in children, using a population-based national survey and
parent reports. This analysis is responsive to Drotar (1994), who called for a
wider array of research methods and designs in order to provide replication and
to improve generalizability of results. A limitation of previous research results
from biased case accrual through tertiary care centers, and restrictions to the case
definition of CP which exclude children with MR and other comorbidities. Our
analysis gives us insight into the complex challenges facing children with CP and
their families.
The results of this analysis indicate that the previous estimates of the fre-
Behavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 459
quency of behavior problems may be exaggerated. Our finding that 25.5% of
children with CP had a behavior problem, which is lower than previous estimates
of 30-80%, probably results from our use of a national data source which does
not restrict the cases to children with CP who attend specialty practices or other
sites of research (Graham & Rutter, 1968a; Houcade & Pasrette, 1984;
McDonald, 1987; Rosenbloom. 1971). It is likely that there are many children
with CP who function well and receive little extraordinary medical care. Thus,
the sample used in our analysis is more likely to represent the wide array of
children with CP including those not attending specialty clinics.
The general pattern of our findings corroborates previous studies suggesting
increased levels of behavioral disorders among children with chronic illness
(Gortmaker et al., 1990), with chronic disability (Cadman et al., 1987), and
chronic illness with CNS involvement (Breslau & Marshall, 1985; Howe et al.,
1993). Although children with CP are at greater risk for developing behavior
problems, across all dimensions of the BPI, they are considerably less likely to
develop problems assessed by the antisocial and peer conflict scales. As a group,
children with CP are at considerable risk for developing problems assessed by the
headstrong and the dependency scales. An examination of the item content of the
headstrong scale reveals a combination of noncompliance at home and mood
content, whereas the dependency scale items appear to be more internally consis-
tent. It is interesting to speculate about the possible antecedent conditions con-
tributing to the development of problems in these behavioral domains. It is quite
possible that parental management practices may be a contributing factor to these
behavioral problems. Headstrong behaviors, for example, may be the conse-
quence of inconsistent disciplinary practices or the failure of parents to set
appropriate limits in their management practices. Likewise, dependency may
also be fostered by the failure to teach skills which lead to the development of
independent functioning. For children with CP, the physical limitations may also
influence their ability to function independently. Clearly, future research should
be undertaken to determine how parent disciplinary practices and parent-child
interactions influence the behavioral development of children with CP. Addi-
tionally, research should also be extended to examine behavioral consistency
across situations (i.e., home, school) using behavioral rating scales and observa-
tional methods.
The number of children with CP was relatively low in the NHIS since CP is
a rare event. Therefore, we are cautious about the interpretation of this analysis
since the number of children with CP with each behavior is small. Another
limitation of our analysis is that cross-sectional data can only show an associa-
tion. Additional studies that have a longitudinal design are necessary to provide
information about the development of behavior problems over time and causality.
Our inability to separate out MR from CP in the 1988 data represents a
confound which, because of the data, cannot be addressed. However, since all
460 McDermott et al.
the behavior problems, except being headstrong and dependent, were more se-
vere for children with MR (1981 data set) we believe that these behaviors, which
continued to be significant and severe for the combined group, are truly problem-
atic for a mixed group of children with CP.
Our analysis indicates that approximately 87% of the children had another
health or school problem. The list of comorbidities was quite extensive, includ-
ing respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory, musculoskeletal, sensory, and other
conditions. Other researchers have reported that the most common comorbidities
for children with CP include MR, epilepsy, and sensory impairments. The report-
ed frequency of MR in children with CP was 65%; 46% of children with CP had
epilepsy, 15% had a sensory impairment (Murphy et al., 1993). For those with
severe mental retardation (1Q < 50) the percentage with CP ranges from 20-40%
(Blomquist, Gustavson, & Holmgren, 1981; Fryers, 1984; Gustavson, Holm-
gren, Jonsell, & Blomquist, 1977).
Some researchers question the use of a data set that is not designed specifi-
cally for the study of chronic conditions, since the severity of the condition is not
assessed (Brooks-Gunn, Phelps, & Elder, 1991; Drotar, 1994; Stein & Jessop,
1989). The severity of MR and CP was not available in this data set and this
should be investigated in further research to discern how problem behaviors vary
along this dimension.
Another limitation of this study is the sole reliance upon parents as the
source of the child's adjustment. Wallander et al. (1988) suggested that maternal
perception of child behavior is probably dependent on certain child and maternal
characteristics. Future research should seek to validate parent reports using other
informants such as professionals and teachers, and behavioral observation sched-
ules. Another approach to validation is to identify the correlation between high
scores (above the 90th percentile) and referral to counseling services. We found
that 7 of the 12 children with CP who had scores above the 90th percentile for
behavior problems were referred to psychologists, psychiatrists, and other coun-
selors. This validation of the Behavior Problem Index used for the 1981 NH1S
was reported previously by Gortmaker et al. (1990).
The implications of this analysis are multifaceted. It is clear that parents
perceive some behavior problems are associated with CP in children. Although a
substantial proportion of children with CP experience significant behavioral
problems, our findings also reveal most do not develop such problems. Addition-
al research, therefore, needs to focus on identifying protective factors related to
children and their environments that may reduce the risk of developing the onset
of behavioral problems. These factors could include social support networks and
school placements. Finally, research needs to address the effectiveness of antici-
patory guidance, therapeutic effects of ongoing interventions for the disability
(e.g., occupational, physical, and speech and language therapy), and psychologi-
cal counseling for the children and/or families.
Behavior Problems in Children with Cerebral Palsy 461
This study adds a population-based analysis to the literature on behavior
problems associated with childhood cerebral palsy. Breslau (1985) reported that
"brain involvement conferred a risk for social isolation independent of mental
retardation" for 98 children with CP who were seen in teaching hospital clinics.
We suggest that perhaps social isolation is a problem associated with children
with severe CP. Our results imply that dependency and headstrong behaviors are
challenges faced by a diverse and, therefore, representative group of children
with CP.
