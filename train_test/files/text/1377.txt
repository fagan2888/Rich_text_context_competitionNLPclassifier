Between 1994 and 1996, the National Center for Health
Statistics used sophisticated sampling methods to mea-
sure the number and types of ambulatory surgery cases
performed in the United States. We reanalyzed raw
data obtained from this National Survey of Ambulatory
Surgery to select cases with an anesthesia provider and
here report characteristics of these 228,332 cases (e.g.,
patient age, anesthetic type). The goal of our study was
to estimate what percentage of cases, of a specified sur-
gical procedure or combination of procedures, may
have been performed less than once per year per facil-
ity. Previous studies suggest the most important source
of scheduling inaccuracy can be the absence of recently
performed cases on which to base predictions of case
duration. We found that 36%  1% (se) of all cases in the
United States were a type of procedure or combination
of procedures that occurred 6984 times per year (the
number of surgery facilities performing ambulatory
surgery in the United States). Approximately one third
of all ambulatory cases were of a procedure or combina-
tion of procedures that may have been performed as
infrequently as once per year per facility. This could
impair the effectiveness of predicting the durations of
ambulatory cases by using historical case-duration
data.
(Anesth Analg 2000;90:1343­7)
Operating room (OR) managers may aim to im-
prove OR scheduling by increasing the accuracy
of predictions of the durations of newly sched-
uled cases. Historical case durations stored in com-
puter databases can be used to predict case duration
when a surgeon schedules a case of the same proce-
dure or combination of procedures as cases that the
surgeon has previously scheduled (1­7).
For purposes of predicting case duration, a case can
be classified based on the procedure (e.g., local exci-
sion of breast lesion) or a combination of two or more
procedures (e.g., local excision of right breast lesion
and left modified radical breast mastectomy). Classi-
fying cases by procedure or combination of proce-
dures is useful to account for the complexity of cases
and can increase the accuracy of predicted case dura-
tions. However, as there are thousands of different
surgical procedures, and an even greater number of
combinations of procedures, there may be too few like
cases on which to base predictions of the duration of a
newly scheduled case (1­3).
Our previous studies showed, by using data from
an academic medical center, that the most important
source of inaccuracy in predicting the length of time to
complete a series of cases in an OR for a given day can
be the absence of recently performed cases of the same
procedure or a combination of procedures (1,2). This
absence of historical case-duration data can also be the
primary reason why individual cases take longer than
scheduled (2). Such inaccuracy in predicting case du-
rations may affect OR utilization, increase underuti-
lized OR time (rooms finishing earlier than predicted),
increase overutilized OR time (rooms finishing later
than predicted), and increase the number of cases not
starting on time (8­10).
It is not clear whether the absence of recently per-
formed cases of the same procedure or combination of
procedures, as found at the academic medical center,
is likely to apply at many other surgical suites. The
goal of this study was to analyze raw data from the
National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (NSAS) to
determine the relative frequency of cases of a specified
procedure or combination of procedures possibly per-
formed so infrequently (e.g., less than once per year
per facility) as to impair OR scheduling based on
case-duration data.

Methods
Review of the NSAS
The United States National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) used sophisticated sampling methods to com-
plete the NSAS in 1994, 1995, and 1996. The purpose of
this government survey was to gather and dissemi-
nate nationally representative data about ambulatory
surgery performed in the nation's hospitals and free-
standing ambulatory surgery centers (11,12). The sur-
vey used a probability sample, so that nationally rep-
resentative results could be obtained without
surveying every ambulatory surgery case in the
United States (11,12). In particular, the probability of
an ambulatory patient visit being included in the sur-
vey depended on characteristics of the facility, and the
location within that facility, where the patient had
surgery (e.g., cystoscopy room).
The probability of a facility being included in the
survey was based on its type (hospital versus free-
standing), specialty, geographic region, and annual
number of ambulatory surgery cases. There were
5252 hospitals and 1732 freestanding ambulatory sur-
gery facilities meeting study inclusion criteria (12).
Hospitals with fewer than six staffed beds were ex-
cluded. Federal, military, and Department of Veterans
Affairs hospitals were excluded. Freestanding facili-
ties included in the survey were state licensed or
certified by the Health Care Financing Administration
for Medicare participation. Facilities specializing in
dentistry, podiatry, abortion, or child birth were ex-
cluded. Facilities owned by a hospital but located
some distance away from the hospital were consid-
ered freestanding.
Once a facility was chosen, a systematic random
sample was taken of ambulatory surgery visits at the
facility (12). For the survey, ambulatory surgery was
defined as scheduled outpatient (admitted and dis-
charged from the facility on the same day) surgery
performed in any of the following locations: general or
main OR, satellite OR, cystoscopy room, endoscopy
room, cardiac catheterization lab, or laser procedure
room (12). If patients were subsequently admitted to a
hospital as inpatients, they were included in the survey.
Patients originally admitted as a hospital inpatient or
admitted through the emergency room were excluded.
After selection of ambulatory surgery visits for in-
clusion in the survey, data from each visit were ab-
stracted from the medical record. Staff contracted by
the NCHS coded the abstracted data, and assigned to
each case from one to a maximum of six ICD-9-CM
procedure codes.
Our Analysis of the Raw Data from the NSAS
We reanalyzed the raw data, from the survey, re-
leased for public use on CD-ROM by the NCHS. We
considered the 228,332 ambulatory surgery visits with
an anesthesia provider present to have been a surgical
case. Because we combined the 1994, 1995, and
1996 data, we adjusted the ICD-9-CM codes to be
those effective on a common date (October 1, 1995).
We limited our consideration to cases with an anes-
thesia provider; otherwise, many of the cases the sur-
vey considered to be surgical were medical procedures,
such as cardiac catheterization and colonoscopy, per-
formed outside of surgical suites.
The NCHS assigned each case a weight calculated
by using statistical methods that considered the prob-
ability of selection of the case's facility, the probability
of case selection from among all cases at the facility,
and the response rates of facilities and locations within
facilities. The use of weights allowed the cases in-
cluded in the survey to be used to determine nation-
ally representative results.
Ideally, we would have used the NSAS's raw data
to determine what percentage of cases in the United
States were of a procedure or combination of proce-
dures performed only once a year at the case's facility.
Because of the differential weighting, we could not
calculate results on a per-facility basis or as a percent-
age of cases in the survey. Instead, we report the
percentage of cases that were of a procedure or com-
bination of procedures performed in the United States
6984 times per year or fewer (12). We chose 6984
because this was the number of surgery facilities per-
forming ambulatory surgery in the United States (12).
If procedures were distributed homogeneously among
facilities, then, if a case was performed 6984 times per
year, this would give an average of one case per
facility per year.
To assess sensitivity of our results to the homoge-
neity assumption, we also determined the percentage
of cases that were of a procedure or combination of
procedures performed 3,492 times per year or fewer,
which is one-half the number of ambulatory surgery
facilities in the United States. Finally, we determined
the percentage of cases performed annually in the
United States 1,000 times or fewer. All standard errors
were calculated by using the methods described by
the NCHS, which compensate for the differential
weighting of the cases (12).
Results
Characteristics of ambulatory surgery cases per-
formed in the United States between 1994 and 1996 are
reported in Table 1. A total of 46% of cases had two or
more ICD-9 surgical procedures.
There were 24,084 different combinations of proce-
dures performed among the 228,332 cases in the
NSAS. The 10 most common combinations of proce-
dures with an anesthesia provider accounted for 23%
of all ambulatory surgery cases (Table 2).

For 36% of ambulatory surgery cases, the annual
number of cases of the specified procedure or combi-
nation of procedures was 6984 or fewer (Table 3, left
column). If procedures were distributed homoge-
neously among facilities, then this would give an aver-
age of one case per facility per year (Table 3, middle
column). Part of the explanation for this finding could
have been that many cases had more than one proce-
dure. However, even for cases that had only one proce-
dure, we found that 20%  1% of these cases were of a
procedure performed alone 6984 times per year.
For 30% of ambulatory surgery cases, there were
3492 cases or fewer per year of the specified procedure
or combination of procedures, where 3492 equals one-
half the number of ambulatory surgery facilities in the
United States (Table 3). Overall, 20% of cases were of
a procedure or combination of procedures performed
annually in the United States 1000 times or fewer
(Table 3).
Discussion
Implications of Our Results
Many surgical suites rely on historical case-duration
data to predict the durations of newly scheduled
cases. Nevertheless, we found that approximately one
third of ambulatory cases were of a procedure or
combination of procedures expected to have been per-
formed once per year per facility (if the procedures
were distributed homogeneously among facilities).
This result has important implications for improving
OR scheduling. Surgical cases of a procedure or com-
bination of procedures performed together infre-
quently probably account for a sufficiently large per-
centage of ambulatory surgery cases as to impairing
the accuracy of OR scheduling based on historical
case-duration data at many surgical suites. OR man-
agers may expect the relative frequency of uncommon
cases to be even greater at tertiary surgical suites than
in the ambulatory surgery setting (2).
Our findings support our previously reported re-
sults (1,2) from the University of Iowa. Also, our find-
ings are consistent with the large number of surgeon
preference cards found at surgery suites. For example,
a private hospital reported having more than 5600
surgeon preference cards (13). The University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham had more than 13,000 surgeon
preference cards (14).
Whether a case was of a procedure or combination
of procedures performed 1000 times per year in the
United States, all 1000 occurrences could have been at
only a few specialized facilities. This is unlikely be-
cause only 10% of facilities performing ambulatory
surgery specialize in one surgical specialty (e.g., eye
centers) (12).
Decreasing perioperative costs by analyzing histor-
ical case durations to improve scheduling accuracy,
may be limited because of the high frequency of un-
common procedures or combinations of procedures.
The impact of uncommon procedures becomes mag-
nified when predicting the time to complete a series of
consecutive elective cases, as is relevant to OR staffing
(1). As an example, we assumed that an OR has two
cases scheduled in it. From our study, the likelihood
that any particular case will have less than one similar
case in the previous year at the facility may equal 36%
(Table 3, right column). Then, we would expect that a
series of two cases has a 59% chance that one or both
cases has no recent historical data, where 59% 
(probability that both cases have no previous cases) 
(probability that either the first case or the second case
has no previous cases)  0.362  2  0.36  [1  0.36].
Many operating rooms in ambulatory surgical suites
will have more than two cases (15). However, by only
choosing two cases per day per OR for this example,
we deliberately underestimated the impact of having
cases of a procedure or combination of procedures not
recently performed at the facility.
There are other explanations for inaccuracy in pre-
dicting case duration. For example, some practitioners
may explain scheduling inaccuracy by stating that
case durations are often not predicted with the goal of
accuracy, but to get as many cases into the OR schedule

as possible. At surgical suites for which case durations
are often deliberately predicted inaccurately, the OR
managers may try to overcome this problem by relying
only on historical case durations from the OR informa-
tion systems to predict case durations. At these surgical
suites, the absence of recently performed cases of the
same procedure or combination of procedures can be
particularly disadvantageous (2). In addition, there is no
way to reliably determine whether cases are being
scheduled intentionally in an inaccurate manner.
Reasons Why Our Study Probably
Underestimated the True Frequency of
Cases of an Uncommon Procedure or
Combination of Procedures
Although we focused in our study on the number of
cases of a specified procedure or combination of pro-
cedures per year, the more relevant value is probably
the number of cases per surgeon per year. Including
who the surgeon is when making case predictions is
important, because although scheduled procedure(s)
is the most important predictor of case duration,
which surgeon will perform the case is the second
most important predictor of case duration (1­3,5­
6,16). Both the procedure or combination of proce-
dures, and who the surgeon is, are required to predict
case duration accurately (5­6,16). Although there
were 6984 ambulatory surgery facilities in the United
States (12), there were more than 151,000 surgeons
(17). Had we considered both procedure(s) and sur-
geon, we would expect there to be even fewer previ-
ous cases from which to predict case duration. For this
reason, we underestimated the number of different
categories of cases important for predicting case
duration.
Another important predictor of case duration is the
type of anesthesia, ie, surgeon-administered local an-
esthesia, monitored anesthesia care, or major anesthe-
sia (16). We limited our consideration to cases for
which an anesthesia provider was present. By exclud-
ing cases without an anesthesia provider, we under-
estimated the number of different categories of cases
important for predicting case duration.
CPT-4 codes are used more often in predicting case
duration than are ICD-9-CM codes. Our use of ICD-
9-CM codes, rather than CPT-4 codes, had the effect of
underestimating the percentage of cases of a proce-
dure or combination of procedures that occurred to-
gether infrequently. Although there were 5780 CPT
codes for surgical procedures with corresponding an-
esthesia codes, there were 3626 inpatient and outpa-
tient procedure ICD-9-CM codes, 2485 of which were
used in the NSAS in cases with an anesthesia provider
present. For example, although 42820 and 42821 are
CPT-4 codes for tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy in

Summary
We reanalyzed data from the NSAS to determine
whether our previous observation, that many surgical
cases are a type of procedure or combination of pro-
cedures performed together infrequently, was unique
to an academic medical center. We found that surgical
cases of a procedure or combination of procedures
performed together infrequently, probably account for
a sufficiently large percentage of ambulatory surgery
cases as to impair the accuracy of OR scheduling using
historical case-duration data at many surgical suites.
