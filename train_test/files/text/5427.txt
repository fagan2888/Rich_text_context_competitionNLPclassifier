Abstract: An optimization analysis of human behavior from a comparative perspective can
improve our understanding of the adaptiveness of human nature. Intra-specific competition
for resources provides the main selective pressure for the evolution of violent aggression
toward conspecifics, and variation in the fitness benefits and costs of aggression can
account for inter-specific and inter-individual differences in aggressiveness. When
aggression reflects competition for resources, its benefits vary in relation to the
characteristics of the resources (their intrinsic value, abundance, spatial distribution, and
controllability) while its costs vary in relation to the characteristics of organisms and how
they fight (which, in turn, affects the extent to which aggression entails risk of physical
injury or death, energetic depletion, exposure to predation, psychological and physiological
stress, or damage to social relationships). Humans are a highly aggressive species in
comparison to other animals, probably as a result of an unusually high benefit-to-cost ratio
for intra-specific aggression. This conclusion is supported by frequent and widespread
occurrence of male-male coalitionary killing and by male-female sexual coercion. Sex
differences in violent aggression in humans and other species probably evolved by sexual
selection and reflect different optimal competitive strategies for males and females.

Understanding the Evolution of Human Nature: The Importance of Comparative
Research
The earliest systematic attempts to investigate human behavior from an
evolutionary perspective focused on demonstrating the existence of human universals; i.e.,
patterns of behavior, emotional expression, and thought that could be observed in all
human cultures and therefore were hypothesized to be genetically determined, hardwired in
our brains, and presumably the result of evolution by natural selection. Examples of this
approach include the documentation of cross-cultural similarities in facial expressions of
emotions (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1972) and the study of sex differences in mate preferences
across cultures (Buss, 1989). At the same time, parallels were increasingly being made
between human behavior and the behavior of other animals, particularly other primates
(Morris, 1967). These two approaches were aimed at establishing the existence of human
nature and thus legitimizing studies of human behavior grounded in evolutionary biology
and animal behavioral ecology.
Subsequent research in evolutionary psychology shifted its focus to empirical
testing of hypotheses derived chiefly from the theories of sexual selection, life history and
parental investment (Barrett, Dunbar, and Lycett, 2002; Buss, 2005; Dunbar and Barrett,
2007). There was also a parallel shift in interest from "normative" aspects of human nature
to inter-individual variation (e.g., Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper, 1991; Gangestad and
Simpson, 2000).
Although many evolutionary psychologists focus their attention exclusively on
human mind and behavior, the comparative study of adaptations in other organisms has
made an important historical contribution to evolutionary psychology through the
development of evolutionary theories and hypotheses, which are now being tested with
human psychological and behavioral data (Daly and Wilson, 1999; Smith, Borgerhoff
Mulder, and Hill, 2000, 2001). Studies of nonhuman animals continue to be a source of
ideas, inspiration, and guidance for evolutionary psychologists, and in some cases human
studies are specifically designed to assess whether the findings from animal research can be
extrapolated to humans. For these reasons, it is important to be familiar with the historical
findings of comparative research that led to the development of evolutionary theories
(beginning with Darwin's own studies of many different living organisms) as well as to
keep up with advances in comparative research.
It may be argued that evolutionary psychologists should not only know about
comparative research but also actively engage in it. Although much evolutionary
psychology research has moved away from the investigation of "normative" behaviors,
many aspects of human nature are not yet well characterized, some old questions about
human nature have not yet been answered, and many new questions can be raised. The
issue of whether human nature exists has been effectively investigated with cross-cultural
studies and could be further addressed with the investigation of genetic or neurobiological
substrates of psychological and behavioral traits that are common across all human
cultures. More importantly, the question of how human nature evolved is far from being
settled and this question can be addressed only with a comparative approach.
There are two main approaches to comparative research on the evolution of human
When violence pays

nature: phylogenetic analyses and functional "optimization" analyses. Comparative
phylogenetic analyses aim to document the phylogenetic history of a trait and to test
hypotheses about the trait's functional significance across taxa (Nunn, 2011). These
analyses cannot be applied effectively to traits that have a recent evolutionary history and
have evolved within the Homo lineage, such as language. Many human psychological and
behavioral traits, however, particularly those associated with cooperation, competition,
mating, or parenting, are also present in other species (Kappeler and Silk, 2009). In some
cases, the presence of similar traits in different species is the product of inheritance from a
common ancestor (i.e., the traits are homologous). Homologous traits are more likely to
occur in closely-related than in distantly-related species. Traits that have an ancient
phylogenetic history and are observed in many different organisms are unlikely to be
neutral or deleterious; rather, they likely represent adaptations that are so valuable as to be
highly conserved (Roney and Maestripieri, 2002). Thus, phylogenetic "mapping" of human
psychological and behavioral traits can be an important contribution toward understanding
the evolution of many adaptive aspects of human nature.
A comparative approach can also be used to investigate traits that are similar in
different species due to the process of convergent evolution. When different species
confront similar problems in their environment, they often come up with similar optimal
solutions to these problems. An optimal strategy to solve a problem is one that results in
maximal benefits at a minimal cost (Clutton-Brock and Harvey, 1984). Analyzing the
fitness benefits and costs of psychological and behavioral traits, along with knowledge of
the relevant environmental selective pressures and constraints, allows evolutionary
psychologists to obtain evidence that these traits are adaptations. Cost-benefit analyses of
human adaptive traits, when conducted from a comparative perspective, can shed light on
the evolution of these adaptations and on the evolution of human nature more generally.
Let us take aggressiveness as an example of an aspect of human nature for which
there are still many unanswered questions (Buss and Duntley, 2006; Buss and Shackelford,
1997; Liddle, Shackelford, and Weeks-Shackelford, 2012). Two such questions are: Why is
it that humans seem to have a high potential for violent aggression toward their
conspecifics? And why is it that this potential for violent aggression seems to be much
higher in men than in women? In this article we will attempt to answer these questions by
taking a comparative approach and examining aggression in humans and other animals
from a functional perspective (i.e., examining the fitness benefits and costs of this
behavior). In our discussion of intra-specific aggression, we assume that the general
potential for aggression of a species and the average levels of aggression of males and
females are the product of natural selection and not of aberrant environmental
circumstances (for example, dramatic alterations of the habitat of wild animal populations
induced by human activity), cultural forces, or selection on other traits that are associated
with aggression.
What Makes an Animal Species More or Less Aggressive?
From a functional perspective, aggression can be viewed as an expression of
competition (Darwin, 1859, 1871). Competition for resources between individuals of the
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -681-
same species is widespread in nature, and to some extent, inter-specific variation in
aggressiveness reflects species differences in the overall intensity of competition. There are
different ways in which organisms can compete for resources, however, and competitive
strategies do not necessarily involve aggression. From an optimization perspective,
organisms in any given species will use a particular competitive strategy only when its
benefits outweigh the costs. If different competitive strategies are available, organisms will
tend to use the strategy with the highest benefit/cost ratio.
In animal species that are relatively less aggressive, the benefits of aggressive
competition are probably lower than its costs. It is also possible that less aggressive species
can pursue alternative competitive strategies with higher benefit/cost ratios than
competitive aggression. Finally, regardless of benefits and costs, there may be physical,
social, ecological, or behavioral constraints that make it difficult or impossible for
aggression to be expressed in these species (e.g., in sessile marine invertebrates, highly
solitary animals, or small nocturnal animals under heavy predation pressure). The opposite
is true for highly aggressive species. Here the benefits of aggression are presumably higher
than its costs, making aggression the preferred competitive strategy. In addition, there may
be few or no constraints on the expression of aggressive behavior.
To understand inter-specific variation in the benefit/cost ratios for aggression, it
may be useful to examine separately variation in the benefits and in the costs. Whenever
aggression reflects competition for resources, the benefit of aggression is obtaining those
resources. Variation in the potential benefits of aggression generally depends on the
characteristics of the resources. Aggression can entail many different types of costs
including risk of injury or death, physiological or psychological stress, energy expenditure,
increased risk of attracting predators, and damage to social relationships, as well as time-
allocation trade-offs with other survival- or reproduction-related activities such as feeding
or mating. Variation in the potential costs of aggression generally depends on the
characteristics of the organisms and the kind of aggressive behavior they use. In a nutshell,
the benefits of aggression depend on what animals fight about, while the costs depend on
how they fight.
Inter-specific Variation in the Benefits of Aggression
The benefits of aggression vary in relation to the characteristics of the resource
being contested: its value, abundance, spatial distribution, and the extent to which it can be
effectively monopolized by individuals or groups. As examples, we will briefly discuss
how the characteristics of resources such as food, mates, or space influence the probability
that competition will be aggressive.
Competition for food
When organisms compete for food that has high nutritional value, is generally
scarce, and is distributed in small patches that can be effectively monopolized, the potential
benefits of aggressive competition are high (Isbell, 1991; Koenig and Borries, 2009;
Wrangham, 1980). The most clear example of a food type that is patchily distributed, is
difficult to obtain, and can be monopolized effectively is meat. Intense aggressive
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -682-
("contest") competition over meat is typical of social carnivores such as lions or hyenas
(Kruuk, 1972; Schaller, 1972).
At the other extreme is low-quality food that is widely distributed and cannot be
monopolized, such as grass or leaves. Herbivorous and folivorous organisms still compete
with their conspecifics over food but competition is indirect ("scramble"), which means
that individuals try to consume as much as possible of the resource without attacking or
displacing others from it (Isbell, 1991; van Schaik, 1989). Note that the prediction here
refers to the quality of the food rather than to the specific type of food. Thus, if some
folivores show selectivity and feed only on high-quality leaves that are less common in
their environment and therefore worth fighting for, aggressive contest competition is
expected to occur, as has been shown for between-group feeding competition in black-and-
white colobus monkeys (Harris, 2006; Snaith and Chapman, 2007).
In-between the two extremes of species that feed on meat and grass or leaves are the
species that feed on fruit. Fruit is a highly nutritious food that is usually distributed in
discrete patches that can be monopolized by one individual or, more often, by a group. The
benefits of aggressive competition for access to fruit are high, so that frugivores are
generally more aggressive than folivores or herbivores, and in some cases as aggressive as
carnivores (for nonhuman primates, see Van Schaik, 1989).
Competition for mates
In most species of vertebrates, fertile males are an abundant, "low-value" resource
that cannot and need not be monopolized by females. As a result, if females were to use
aggression to compete with other females over access to males, or to sexually coerce males
to have exclusive access to them, the benefits of such aggression would be low. In contrast,
fertile females are a relatively scarce, high-value resource. In many mammals, most adult
females are either pregnant or lactating most of the time; when they are neither pregnant
nor lactating, they are fertile only a few days every month. The distribution of females in
space and time generally affects whether or not they can be effectively monopolized by
males for reproductive purposes (Clutton-Brock, 1989; Emlen and Oring, 1977). This, in
turn, determines the potential benefits of male-male aggressive competition. When fertile
females forage alone and are widely dispersed in space (usually due to ecological needs or
constraints), many of them cannot be effectively monopolized by a single male or a group
of males; social and sexual monogamy tends to evolve, which in some cases is
accompanied by high male parental investment (e.g., Clutton-Brock, 1991). In this situation
the benefits of male aggression are low. Accordingly, in socially or sexually monogamous
species, there is little male-male aggressive competition for mates, at least after the initial
establishment of pairs, and little male-female sexual coercion. These low levels of male-
male aggressive competition and the low potential for sexually coercive tactics are reflected
in the lower sexual dimorphism in body size among monogamous species both in mammals
and in birds (Clutton-Brock and Harvey, 1977; Dunn, Whittingham, and Pitcher, 2001;
Pérez-Barbería, Gordon, and Pagel, 2002; Plavcan, 2004).
In contrast, when females are clumped in space because they live and forage in
groups, groups of females can be monopolized either by a single male (one-male groups
with a harem mating system) or by multiple males (multi-male multi-female groups with a
When violence pays

promiscuous mating system). Such species typically have higher levels of sexual
dimorphism than monogamous species. This is indicative of intense intra-sexual selection
and also suggests potential for sexual coercion of females. In such polygynous and
promiscuously mating species, the benefits of male-male aggressive competition (Fabiani,
Galimberti, Sanvito, and Hoelzel, 2004) and male-female sexual coercion can be high
(Muller, Emery Thompson, Kahlenberg, and Wrangham, 2011).
Competition for space
Competition for space (e.g., territories) is a special case of competition because
instead of competing directly for food or mates, animals may compete for the space in
which they are found. Aggressive competition also occurs over nesting sites (Semel and
Sherman, 2001), shelter (Holbrook and Schmitt, 2002), and access to drinking water
(Wrangham, 1981). Territorial aggression can be intense when the benefits are high. This is
illustrated by the territorial behavior of chimpanzees, which have been reported to seek out
and kill rival males one at a time, progressively expanding their own territory into what had
previously been their neighbors' land (Goodall et al., 1979; Mitani, Watts, and Amsler,
2010). Males benefit from expanding their own home range in two ways. First, range-
expansion increases the number of fruit trees to which their community has access.
Chimpanzees are ripe-fruit specialists and the quality of the females' diet determines
important parameters of their reproductive function and success (Emery Thompson and
Wrangham, 2008). Expanding the range of the community and thereby increasing both the
quantity and the quality of foods available to females leads to higher reproduction rates
(Williams, Oehlert, Carlis, and Pusey, 2004). Moreover, by eliminating the males of
neighboring communities, the resident males may also gain additional mating
opportunities: Neighboring females are likely to join the territorially aggressive community
and thus provide new sexual opportunities for the winning males (Emery Thompson,
Newton-Fisher, and Reynolds, 2006; Nishida, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, Hasegawa, and
Takahata, 1985). Such events, in turn, set in motion another cycle of violence: Any new
female chimpanzees arriving into a community will be subject to aggressive harassment
from the resident females (Kahlenberg, Emery Thompson, Muller, and Wrangham, 2007),
behavior that is related to female-female competition over good foraging areas within the
community's territory (Kahlenberg, Emery Thompson, and Wrangham, 2008).
Many primate, and also human, inter-group interactions are related to competition
over food or mates, and aggression plays a key role in all of them (Crofoot and Wrangham,
2009). However, to explain the variation in the intensity of such aggressive interactions
(e.g., why in some species but not others individuals seek out and kill their rivals as
opposed to just repelling them temporarily from their territory) we also need to consider the
costs of aggression.
Inter-specific Variation in the Costs of Aggression
Physical costs: Injury or death
Fighting between conspecifics entails risk of injury or even death due to irreparable
damage to vulnerable body parts, massive bleeding from open wounds, or bacterial
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -684-
infections of wounds. Such costs of aggression are potentially higher in animal species
equipped with weapons such as horns or antlers, or large and sharp canine teeth or claws,
and lower in species that do not possess these or other natural weapons.
Most horn-like weapons among ungulates probably evolved through sexual
selection for fighting ability (Geist, 1966). Even though in some species antler development
may signal male fertility to potential mates (Malo, Roldan, Garde, Soler, and Gomendio,
2005), they are primarily used in male-male contests and only secondarily as a defense
against predators (Clutton-Brock, 1982). Intense fighting in species with antlers and horns
is usually restricted to the breeding season, when the potential benefits of risky aggression
are high. This leads to a concomitant increase in the rate of injuries and deaths among male
competitors during such periods (Clutton-Brock, Albon, Gibson, and Guinness, 1979;
Geist, 1974; Wilkinson and Shank, 1976).
Individuals in species that do not have antlers or horns can still kill each other given
the opportunity. Deaths from intra-specific aggression typically result from infection of bite
wounds and overall exhaustion from fighting (Baker and McCann, 1989; Knott, 1999;
Knott and Laman, 1998; Palombit, 1993) rather than from direct blows and punctures of
vital organs. Among wild baboons, wounding is more common among males and occurs
more frequently during periods when individuals of either sex compete most intensely for
dominance (MacCormick et al., 2012). In rhesus macaques, adult male mortality is
significantly higher during the mating season than during the birth season, presumably as a
result of increased male-male fighting during periods of time in which many females are
fertile (Hoffman et al., 2008).
Lethal killing is relatively rare in animals, in part because many organisms have
evolved mechanisms to reduce the risk of serious injury or death associated with fighting.
Some of these mechanisms include ritualized fighting, in which two opponents barely
touch each other or direct their attacks to non-vulnerable body parts, dominance, in which
contests are settled by an exchange of signals rather than fighting, and coalition formation,
in which two or more individuals can simultaneously attack a target and incur little or no
risk of injury (see below).
Physiological and psychological costs
Even in the absence of physical injury, fighting can entail significant physiological
and psychological costs. Chronically elevated testosterone associated with aggressive
competition may suppress the immune system and thus have deleterious consequences for
health and fitness (Folstad and Karter, 1992; Muehlenbein and Bribiescas, 2005; but see:
Fuxjager, Foufopoulos, Diaz-Uriarte, and Marler, 2011; Nunn, Lindenfors, Pursall, and
Rolff, 2009; Roberts, Buchanan, and Evans, 2004). High testosterone levels have also been
implicated in higher susceptibility to oxidative stress (Alonso-Alvarez, Bertrand, Faivre,
Chastel, and Sorci, 2007), another factor that can affect survivorship and fitness.
Frequent fighting can also be associated with chronically elevated cortisol levels
(Sapolsky, 2004). In species that form dominance hierarchies, cortisol can be elevated in
high-ranking individuals (who must use aggression to maintain their status and repel
challenges from lower-ranking individuals) or in low-ranking individuals (who receive
frequent attacks), or both, depending on the species (Abbott et al., 2003; Creel, 2001; Creel
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -685-
and Sands, 2003). Regardless of the species-typical relationship between dominance and
glucocorticoid production, however, chronically elevated cortisol can result in damage to
body organs and tissues, including the brain (Sapolsky, 2004). Finally, aggression and
fighting, via their effect on dominance rank, can result in psychological alterations such as
chronic anxiety or depression (e.g., Shively et al., 2005), which can negatively impact
survival or reproduction.
Energetic costs
Aggressive behavior can affect the energy budget of an individual via two
pathways: by increasing energy expenditure and by reducing energy intake. Aggressive
contests tend to be physically taxing and, depending on the relative competitive ability of
the contestants, prolonged. African elephant bulls may fight up to 6 hours when
competitors are similarly matched in size and motivation (Poole, 1989). Aggressive
interactions increase oxygen consumption (Hack, 1997) and animal contests are therefore
constrained by the physiological costs of fighting (Briffa and Sneddon, 2007). Aggression
also tends to constrain feeding behavior. Escalated rates of aggression among male lizards
that mate-guard fertile females are frequently associated with a significant reduction in
foraging (Ancona, Drummond, and Zalvidar-Rae, 2010). A similar cost of aggressive
behavior exists among chimpanzee males, as a male's daily rate of aggression is negatively
associated with his feeding time (Georgiev, 2012). Combining the increases in energy
expenditure with the decreases of energy intake, many males suffer significant reductions
in their energy reserves during periods of intense male-male aggressive competition
(Clutton-Brock, Guiness, and Albon, 1982; Galimberti, Sanvito, Braschi, and Boitani,
2007; Georgiev, 2012; Higham, Heistermann, and Maestripieri, 2011; Low, 2006; Marler,
Walsberg, White, and Moore, 1995; Pelletier, Hogg, and Festa-Bianchet, 2006; Rovero,
Hughes, Whiteley, and Chelazzi, 2000). Additional evidence for the significant energetic
costs of aggression also comes from studies demonstrating increases in aggressive behavior
during periods of high food availability (Georgiev, 2012; Golabek, Ridley, and Radford,
2012; Powers and McKee, 1994; Southwick, 1967)--i.e., when energy surplus allows
diverting more resources to agonistic competition. The energetic costs of aggression are
therefore expected to vary between species in relation to (1) type of aggressive behavior
(i.e., more or less exertive; longer or shorter confrontations); (2) ability of individuals to
store energy (e.g., in the form of fat) that can be used during periods of aggressive
competition; and (3) ecological circumstances, particularly with regards to variation in food
abundance.
Increased risk of predation
Aggressive behavior can affect an individual's risk of being killed by a predator in
three different ways. First, aggressive interactions interfere with vigilance behaviors;
second, aggressive challenges may make individuals temporarily less risk-sensitive in their
choices of habitat and behavior (i.e., becoming more exposed); and third, aggressive
interactions may attract the attention of predators due to their conspicuous nature. For
example, fighting reduces vigilance and increases the risk of predation in fish, birds and
lizards (Diaz-Uriarte, 1999; Jakobsson, Brick, and Kullberg, 1995). In species that avoid
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -686-
detection by hiding, such as small solitary nocturnal animals, the noise associated with
fighting can increase the risk of attracting predators. In gregarious species that avoid
predators by escaping quickly when the predator has been spotted, fighting may interfere
with the ability to escape effectively. Thus, overall, species that are less vulnerable to
predation (e.g., those living in predator-free environments, those with larger body size,
those that live in social groups, and in particular those that employ a cooperative system to
monitor threats from predators), all other things being equal, are expected to be more
aggressive than species that are more susceptible to predation.
Damage to social relationships
In group-living species in which individuals depend on cooperation with
conspecifics for defense of resources from other groups, or in which cooperation is needed
for friendships and alliances, fighting can damage social relationships with friends and
allies, including relatives. Social bonds have important fitness benefits (Silk, Alberts, and
Altmann, 2003) and thus alienating friends can be disadvantageous. The importance of
social relationships is supported by evidence that, among primates, individuals sharing a
"valuable relationship" tend to reconcile their conflicts more often than other, less-strongly
affiliated, individuals (Aureli, Cords, and van Schaik, 2002; de Waal, 2000; Palagi,
Antonacci, and Norscia, 2008; Watts, 2006). Aggression would thus be expected to be
more intense and its escalation more frequent in species where little social affiliation,
bonding and cooperation exist among group members. Similarly, in species where males
are not able to dominate females, behaving aggressively toward a female may damage a
male's chances of mating and thus male-female aggression would be selected against
(Hare, Wobber, and Wrangham, 2012).
Sex Differences in Aggression across Different Animal Species
In many species of vertebrates there are important differences in the resources
males and females compete for, as well as in the strategies they use to obtain these
resources. Because of sex differences in parental investment, females compete primarily
over access to food, whereas males compete primarily over access to mates (Trivers, 1972).
For example, wild adult female chimpanzees in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park (Uganda)
fight most often over plant food, whereas males are most commonly aggressive in the
context of sexual competition (Muller, 2002). Males are almost 14 times more aggressive
than females, with the female rate of aggression probably being an overestimate (Muller,
2002).
Inter-specific variation in sex differences in aggressiveness can result from
differences in the benefits or the costs (or both) of aggression to males and females.
Because of the greater benefits of male-male aggressive competition (see above), sexual
selection has favored larger body size among males in many mammals (in >45% of species
males are10% larger than females; Lindenfors, Gittleman, and Jones, 2007). Although
recent comparative work challenges the notion that the male-bias in body size dimorphism
is consistently associated with male social dominance over females (Hemelrijk, Wantia,
and Isler, 2008), a moderate to high degree of dimorphism seems to be a prerequisite for
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -687-
the evolution of one particular form of aggression: sexual coercion. Sexually coercive
behavior occurs mostly in species in which males are both larger than and socially
dominant to females, i.e., when the costs of male-female aggression are low for males
(Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995; Emery Thompson and Alvarado, 2012; Muller and
Wrangham, 2009; Smuts and Smuts, 1993). Conversely, because the benefits of sexual
coercion by females rarely outweigh its costs, this is not a reproductive strategy that has
been documented among female animals, even in species in which females are socially
dominant over males.
Although females in many species engage in intense competitive aggression for
resources (Clutton-Brock, 2009; Rosvall, 2011; Stockley and Bro-Jorgensen, 2011; Tobias,
Montgomerie, and Lyon, 2012), a situation of complete sex-role reversal, in which females
compete for mates more intensely than males, is rare in animals and occurs mostly among
birds and fish (Eens and Pinxten, 2000). In these cases females have a higher potential
reproductive rate and a higher benefit/cost ratio for aggression than males (Clutton-Brock
and Vincent, 1991). In spotted hyenas, females are larger than males and dominate them in
social interactions. Compared to males, they exhibit both higher overall rates of aggression
and higher rates of inter-sexual aggression (Szykman et al., 2003; Van Meter, 2009).
Female aggression in spotted hyenas is adaptive in the context of intense feeding
competition and has also been explained as an extreme form of maternal investment due to
the exceptionally long time that the specialized bone-crushing feeding apparatus takes to
develop in this species, and thus the need of maternal aggressive support during feeding
(Watts, Tanner, Lundrigan, and Holekamp, 2009).
Like spotted hyenas, females in many lemur species tend to be dominant over males
and, at least in some cases, this dominance is achieved through or associated with higher
rates of female aggression (Kappeler, 1990; Meredith, 2012). Female dominance in lemurs
may be associated with a high benefit/cost ratio for aggression relative to males: Females
may gain more from competitive aggression over food than males because of low food
availability in Madagascar and the constraints it poses on female reproduction (Dunham,
2008); in addition, the costs of female aggression may be lower in lemurs than in other
primates because most lemurs are sexually monomorphic.
In polygynous or promiscuous mammalian species, the need to aggressively defend
offspring from infanticidal conspecifics may also select for high female aggressiveness
(Maestripieri, 1992); given that the certainty of parenthood in these species is higher for
females than for males, the benefits of offspring defense are higher in females than in males
and under certain conditions may outweigh the risks associated with aggressing against
larger males.
Inter-specific variation in sex differences in the costs of aggression can be the result
of sex differences in body size, strength, and weaponry. In species in which males are
larger, stronger, and have more weapons than females, the costs of inter-sex aggression are
higher for females than for males due to an increased risk of injury or death (Maestripieri
and Carroll, 1999). Differences between males and females can also occur in the energetic,
psychological or social costs of aggression. In mammals, the energetic and psychological
costs of aggression could be high for females because aggression-related energy
expenditure and stress can interfere with fertility, pregnancy, or motherhood and lactation
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -688-
(Campbell, 1999). The social costs of aggression are expected to be higher in the sex that
shows higher levels of bonding and alliance formation. In mammals, dispersal is more
common in males, and philopatry is common in females. In all mammalian species in
which females are philopatric and form strong bonds with female relatives (Wrangham,
1980), the social costs of aggression may be higher in females than in males.
In some socially and sexually monogamous species, the benefit/cost ratios of
aggression may be similar for males and females because they are similar in body size,
strength and weaponry, in ecological characteristics and dietary needs, and in social styles
and mating strategies, including confidence of parenthood. In other species, males and
females may be equally aggressive because competition for resources is mediated by
competition for social status, and such competition is equally intense for males and
females. For example, in rhesus macaques and many other cercopithecine monkeys, both
males and females have rigid dominance hierarchies that regulate access to resources.
Aggressive competition for high status is highly beneficial to males in terms of higher
access to fertile females during the mating season and to females in terms of greater access
to food and better protection of the offspring during the birth season (Maestripieri, 2007).
Since sexual dimorphism in body size, physical strength, and weaponry is limited in rhesus
macaques, the physical costs of aggression are probably similar for males and females.
Overall, the benefit/cost ratio of aggression is high for both male and female rhesus
macaques, and in this species, there are no observable differences in male and female
aggressiveness.
Benefits and Costs of Violent Aggression in Humans
Human beings clearly have the ability to live peacefully in close proximity to
millions of other people, as it happens in many cities around the world. Yet, violent crimes
have been reported in every human society, and wars and genocide have occurred
repeatedly throughout human history (Pinker, 2011). Human beings seem to have a high
potential for violent aggression, and since virtually all wars have been fought by men and
most murders and other violent crimes are committed by men, this aggressive potential
seems to be much higher in men than in women. Women, however, are not necessarily
peaceful; they also engage in many forms of aggression--physical, verbal, and
psychological. Relative to other animals, humans should probably be categorized as one of
the most aggressive species, and one in which there is a relatively large sex difference in
aggression. To explain the characteristics of human aggression from a comparative
perspective, we will first examine the benefits and costs of aggression for the species as a
whole, and then for males and females separately.
As with other animals, the benefits of aggression in humans depend on the
characteristics of the resources being fought over. From an evolutionary perspective, it is
likely that competition for food, mates, and territories played a key role in shaping our
aggressive nature. Modern humans are omnivorous and there are large geographic, cultural,
and individual differences in the extent to which our diet includes meat, fish, dairy
products, or vegetables. For much of human evolutionary history, however, our diet was
probably more similar to that of chimpanzees than to that of herbivorous or folivorous
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -689-
animals. Meat, fruit, and other highly caloric foods have probably always been a central
component of the human diet. The benefits of aggressive competition over valuable food
that can be effectively monopolized by individuals or groups were probably high
throughout the early history of Homo sapiens and that of our most recent hominid and
nonhuman primate ancestors. Insofar as valuable food was localized in areas that could be
effectively defended, aggressive competition for space was also highly beneficial. Human
beings are a highly territorial species, both at the individual and at the group level.
Trespassing into another individual's territory can elicit highly aggressive responses,
particularly by men. At the group level, territorial disputes between countries or ethnic
groups have precipitated many wars, not to mention the colonization of other continents
and the extermination of local people (Diamond, 1997).
Aggressive competition for access to mates is much more beneficial for human
males than for females, as will be discussed below. Whether aggressive competition is over
food, territories, mates, or the social status that enhances the access to these valuable
resources, it is safe to conclude that ours is a species in which inter-individual competition
can be very intense and in which aggressive competitive strategies can be highly beneficial,
especially for males.
Relative to some other mammals, humans are not particularly large and strong, or
equipped with dangerous weapons such as large and sharp canine teeth or claws, or horns
or antlers. Before humans started using objects and tools as weapons, physical combat
depended on hits inflicted with hands or feet, and scratches or bites. The risk of injury or
death from this type of fighting is relatively low, when compared with the potential costs of
fighting for larger and more dangerous animals such as elephants or rhinos, lions or tigers,
bears or crocodiles, deer or goats. Therefore, the physical costs of aggression in humans are
relatively low compared to some other species. An additional factor that reduces the cost of
aggression in humans is the ability of men to form coalitions (Wrangham, 1999). Similar to
the pattern typical of inter-group coalitionary aggression in male chimpanzees, hunter-
gatherer men kill rivals from neighboring groups when opportunities for low-cost
aggression ("safe killing") are present, i.e., when the attacking group has a numerical
advantage and the victims are unprepared to retaliate (Wrangham and Glowacki, 2012).
The energetic costs of aggression are probably lower for humans than for other,
larger-bodied animals. However, muscle mass is energetically expensive to build and
maintain; an adult man's muscle tissue can consume up to one-fifth of his energy
(Muehlenbein and Bribiescas, 2005). Sexual dimorphism in body composition--especially
in the upper body, where it is most useful in aggressive contexts--suggests that the costs of
fighting in human populations are not insignificant (Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2009);
human females cannot afford to develop such costly weaponry given the energetic demands
of pregnancy and lactation. That human males allocate so much energy to musculature
development despite the fact that it is a substantial caloric investment further evinces the
benefits of being aggressive.
The psychological and hormonal costs of aggression in humans are probably
comparable to those in other social species or possibly higher, given that humans have
greater ability for thinking about the self and greater ability to feel empathy for others'
pain. However, these stress-related costs of aggression are expected to be significant
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -690-
mainly with regard to aggression between family members, or friends and allies. These
costs may be much lower if aggression is directed toward enemies from other groups.
Finally, the social costs of human aggression are expected to be high when fighting
occurs between relatives, friends and allies, or members of one's group, and low when
aggression is directed toward unrelated individuals belonging to other groups. Although
violent aggression is quite common between related individuals or unrelated but highly
familiar individuals, such rates of aggression are actually low, controlling for the amount of
time that these individuals spend together. Human beings have opportunities to interact
with many unrelated individuals from other groups to a much greater extent than other
animals. If damage to valuable social relationships is considered one of the main social
costs of aggression, then aggression toward individuals in other groups has low social costs
because relationships with them are nonexistent. Similarly, large-scale aggression toward
other groups, such as in wars, has low social costs.
The invention and elaboration of projectile weapons, from hand-held spears to
remotely controlled drones, and the consequent ability to hit, injure, and kill other
individuals from a distance has brought about a significant reduction of all the costs of
aggression. Killing someone from a distance by launching a spear or firing a gun has
virtually eliminated the risk of physical injury for the aggressor. The energy expenditure
involved in the use of various types of weapons is minimal as well. Finally, the
psychological, physiological, and social costs of aggression through projectile weapons are
also low, because this type of aggression allows one to attack individuals (or groups) that
are not seen or known, with whom there are no social relationships of any kind, and
without being exposed to the direct consequences of the violence.
With some exceptions, competition through violent aggression generally has a high
benefit/cost ratio for humans. Consider, for example, the situation of the European colonial
armies that first encountered the local populations in America, Africa, Asia, or Australia.
The benefits of using violent aggression against the indigenous populations were
enormous: taking away their land, their possessions, and even their people to use as slaves.
The costs of the colonists' aggression were minimal: Armed with rifles, they could quickly
kill large numbers of indigenous individuals at little or no physical risk to themselves.
Moreover, the indigenous populations looked different and spoke a different language; it
must have been quite easy for the colonists to find a psychological, political, historical, or
religious justification for their violence, without suffering any consequences. These
unusually high benefit/cost ratios for violent aggression against people from other countries
are rare or nonexistent in animals, which may explain why large-scale aggression toward
conspecifics is absent in animals, with the possible exception of chimpanzees and some
species of ants and termites that stage wars against other colonies, destroying or taking
away their resources and enslaving the workers.
When the benefit/cost ratio of violent aggression is lowered, for example, by
punishing aggressive individuals or imposing sanctions on belligerent countries, humans do
become less aggressive. A historical trend for a general reduction in human violent
aggression (Pinker, 2011) suggests that human behavior is sensitive to current selective
pressures and any changes in the environment that might affect its adaptive value. The
benefits and costs of human violent aggression may vary and be differentially weighted not
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -691-
only over historical time but also in relation to geographic location, culture, education,
intelligence, religion, availability of resources, and many other factors. To give just one
example of this variation, consider two human populations such as the Moriori of the
Chatham Islands and the Maori of New Zealand (Diamond, 1997). Although both
populations had descended from the same group of Polynesian farmers, the Maori had
developed a culture of violence and war, whereas the Moriori had developed a culture of
peaceful resolution. This disparity was likely due to a complex combination of
environmental and technological factors that calibrated the costs and benefits of violence
differently for each population. The Maori lived in a climate stable enough to permit
agriculture, which allowed for the development of more advanced weaponry and for
increased population growth, leading to the emergence of tribes and coalitions. A culture of
violent aggression would have been advantageous for the Maori, as a system of agriculture
would have increased the benefit of fighting over monopolizable food and territory, while
the use of weapons and the formation of coalitions would have minimized costs. In
contrast, the harsh environmental conditions on the Chatham Islands impeded technological
advancement and population growth and forced the Moriori to revert back to the hunter-
gatherer lifestyle. The Moriori could not effectively monopolize food resources, had very
simple weaponry, and remained a small population with few or no subgroups. Violent
aggression may have been more costly than beneficial for the Moriori, and so a culture of
peaceful resolution to conflict emerged on the Chatham Islands. Not surprisingly, when
these populations came into contact in 1835, the aggressive Maori exterminated the
peaceful Moriori (Diamond, 1997).
Sex Differences in Human Aggression
Sexual selection theory provides the most convincing evolutionary explanation for
the marked difference in aggressiveness between men and women (Archer, 2009;
Lindenfors and Tullberg, 2011; Puts, 2010). The benefits of both intra- and inter-sexual
aggression are higher for men than women, and they are all related to reproductive effort
(competition for mates and sexual coercion). Among our ancestors, males who were
successful in aggressively keeping their competitors away from fertile females, who could
monopolize these females during their fertile periods and mate exclusively with them, and
who could overcome any female reticence to mate through aggressive coercion presumably
gained a great deal in terms of reproductive success. In contrast, the advantage gained by
females who aggressively competed against other females to mate with superior males may
have been relatively small, given that many females managed to reproduce regardless of
their competitive ability, superior males may have been difficult to find, and monopolizing
mating with these superior males would have little benefit. For these reasons, attempting to
aggressively coerce and monopolize superior males was probably ineffective and did not
bring females significant reproductive benefits.
Risk of injury or death, and energetic, stress-related, and social costs of intra-sexual
aggression may be generally equal in males and females. Being pregnant or having to
breastfeed a child, however, poses a significant energetic constraint on a human female's
ability to engage in violent aggressive behavior--and indeed even on her ability to build
When violence pays
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -692-
the muscle necessary to win confrontations. Although relative to other primates humans are
not highly sexually dimorphic (Plavcan, 2012), differences in male and female stature,
musculature development and strength are not insignificant. Thus, sexual selection
pressures favoring the increase in body size and aggressiveness in males presumably
increased the costs of female aggression. Human females likely developed alternative, non-
physical competitive strategies such as verbal social/relational aggression toward other
women and social manipulation tactics involving sex and investment with men.
Conclusions
The use of aggression in the context of intra-specific competition for resources can
be viewed as an optimization problem and investigated with the fitness cost/benefit
analyses typically used in behavioral ecology. Aggressive competitive strategies evolve
when the benefits of aggression outweigh its costs and when its benefit/cost ratio is higher
than that of alternative, non-aggressive strategies. The benefits and costs of aggressive
competition depend on organisms' physical characteristics, their diet, their mating system
and reproduction, and their anti-predator and social strategies, as well as their environment.
Humans--males more than females--have a propensity to compete for resources
with others, especially non-group members, via violent aggression, when compared to other
animal species. This characteristic of human nature likely evolved because ancestral
humans could fight with rivals or rival bands at relatively low cost (low risk of lethal
injury, or extreme energetic depletion or social stigmatization) but with significant benefit
(access to valuable resources such as meat and fertile females). Sexual dimorphism in body
size, muscle mass, and physical strength also favors male sexual coercion of females.
Lower physical aggressiveness in human females is likely accounted for by lower benefits
and higher costs of aggression, in addition to constraints imposed by reproduction.
A high potential for aggression appears to be a relatively stable characteristic of
human nature that is best understood from a comparative perspective, by examining animal
species that are subjected to similar selective pressures and/or are phylogenetically close to
us. Predicting, however, the extent to which violent aggression is actually exhibited in
human social interactions at the individual or the group level requires a consideration of
historical, geographical, and cultural factors because these factors can impact the benefits
and costs of aggression as much as other biological or environmental variables.
