Abstract
In the present contribution, we examine the link between societal crisis situations and belief in conspiracy
theories. Contrary to common assumptions, belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout
human history. We first illustrate historical incidents suggesting that societal crisis situations--defined as
impactful and rapid societal change that calls established power structures, norms of conduct, or even the
existence of specific people or groups into question--have stimulated belief in conspiracy theories. We then
review the psychological literature to explain why this is the case. Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings
that people experience when in crisis--fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control--stimulate
a motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social
situations. We then explain that after being formed, conspiracy theories can become historical narratives
that may spread through cultural transmission. We conclude that conspiracy theories originate particularly
in crisis situations and may form the basis for how people subsequently remember and mentally represent
a historical event.

Introduction
People continuously experience substantial uncertainty and fear due to societal crisis situations,
such as terrorist attacks, plane crashes, natural disasters, or war. While it is surprisingly difficult to
provide an objective definition of "crisis" as a historical concept-- as labeling an event as a "cri-
sis" almost necessarily requires a subjective judgment, and the significance of an event to justify

that label often can only be evaluated in retrospect (Roitman, 2011)--in this contribution, we uti-
lize a working definition of societal crisis as impactful and rapid societal change that calls existing
power structures, norms of conduct, or even the existence of specific people or groups into ques-
tion. Since people have a fundamental need to understand why events occurred, particularly in the
case of negative or unexpected events (Brückmuller et al., this issue), crisis situations often elicit
sense-making narratives among citizens that become part of their representations of history. Many
of these narratives take the form of conspiracy theories, commonly defined as explanatory beliefs
of how multiple actors meet in secret agreement in order to achieve a hidden goal that is widely
considered to be unlawful or malevolent (Zonis and Joseph, 1994). Central to this definition is a
group, or coalition, of powerful and evil-minded individuals, distinguishing conspiracy beliefs
from other forms of belief (e.g. religion, paranormal belief, and superstition). While some con-
spiracy theories have turned out to be true (e.g. the Watergate and Iran­Contra scandals), most
conspiracy theories in history have no evidence to support them (Pipes, 1997). Well-known exam-
ples of conspiracy theories as explanations of societal crises are allegations that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) was behind the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy
(JFK) or that the Bush administration was involved in plotting the 9/11 terrorist attacks (Sunstein
and Vermeule, 2009).
In the present contribution, we focus on the role that societal crisis situations play in people's
tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the implications of this for how people make sense
of, and remember, past events. We specifically examine whether, and why, societal crisis situations
stimulate belief in conspiracy theories. To do so, we integrate historical insights about crisis events
that have taken place and stimulated conspiracy theories, with psychological insights about under-
lying mental processes leading to conspiracy beliefs. In the following, we first examine how preva-
lent conspiracy theories have been throughout history. Are conspiracy theories mainly a product of
our modern, digital age, facilitated and perpetuated by Internet and social media? Or, have con-
spiracy theories been prevalent among citizens throughout history? As a second step, we provide
examples in both near and distant history of how crisis situations were intimately connected to the
appearance of, and widespread belief in, conspiracy theories. As a third step, we describe the
underlying psychological dynamics of how crisis situations may stimulate belief in conspiracy
theories. As a final step, we explain that once formed, conspiracy theories can stabilize into coher-
ent narratives that influence how people remember, and think about, past events.
Are conspiracy theories unique to our modern time?
A common idea among lay people, journalists, and academics seems to be that we now live in an
"age of conspiracism." To some extent, this assumption is understandable: Conspiracy theories can
be found everywhere on the Internet, and statistics reveal that large portions of ordinary citizens
endorse them for a wide range of topics (Oliver and Wood, 2014; Sunstein and Vermeule, 2009).
As a consequence, both authors of this article are regularly approached by journalists who typically
ask whether--or even downright assume that--conspiracy beliefs are "on the rise" in our current
era. But is this actually true? What does the empirical evidence say about the prevalence of con-
spiracy thinking over time?
In an admirable and exceptionally labor-intensive research project, Uscinski and Parent (2014)
randomly selected a total of 104,803 published letters that US citizens sent to the New York Times
and the Chicago Tribune between 1890 and 2010. These researchers, and a team of trained assis-
tants, coded the letters for conspiratorial content. Each era has its own crisis situations, of course,
and accordingly the content of specific conspiracy theories varied substantially over time. But
more interesting was the prevalence of conspiracy theories: The extent to which these letters
van Prooijen and Douglas 325
contained conspiracy theories fluctuated but did not increase over time. If anything, there were two
spikes in the data suggesting increased conspiratorial content; however, these spikes were not in
the current decade. The first spike occurred shortly before the year 1900, at the height of the second
industrial revolution--a period that was characterized by the rise of major companies, quick tech-
nological progress, and rapidly changing power structures. Such major societal change is a recipe
for feelings of insecurity among citizens, particularly those who feel powerless or voiceless
(Hofstadter, 1966). The second spike occurred during the late 1940s and the early 1950s--a period
that marked the beginning of the Cold War. Many of the conspiracy theories that were ventilated
during that period assumed an association between groups or institutions with communism (e.g.
McCarthyism). The core conclusion that emerges from these data is that conspiracy theories have
not increased over time, and if there ever has been an "age of conspiracism," it is not in the present
decade. Uscinski and Parent reason that, insofar as the Internet plays a role in conspiracy theoriz-
ing, its role seems restricted to replacing other means of communication (e.g. word-of-mouth).
A comparable conclusion emerges from a study by Andeweg (2014), who studied how citizens
feel about politicians, political parties, and democracy, within various European Union (EU) coun-
tries. His study specifically examined whether the trust that people have in politicians and political
parties, and their satisfaction with the political system, has declined over time. The data on satisfac-
tion with democracy range from 1974 to 2012, and the data on trust range from 1997 to 2012. The
results suggest that although across EU member states political trust and satisfaction tend to be
low, they are not declining. There have been within-country fluctuations throughout the years, but
these fluctuations seem mostly due to specific historical events (e.g. economic recession vs pros-
perity) and do not reflect structural changes. Although Andeweg (2014) did not directly assess
belief in conspiracy theories, measures of trust in, and satisfaction with, politicians have been
found to closely predict such beliefs (Abalakina-Paap et al., 1999; Goertzel, 1994). Combined with
Uscinski and Parent's (2014) data, these findings offer little evidence for the proposition that con-
spiracy theories are unique to our digital age.
Furthermore, there is also little evidence to support the idea that conspiracy theories are specific
to Western cultures. Studies have revealed substantial conspiracy theorizing among citizens around
the world, including Eastern Europe (Golec de Zavala and Cichocka, 2012), Asia (Mashuri and
Zaduqisti, 2015; Swami, 2012), South Africa (Grebe and Nattrass, 2012), and the Middle East
(Zonis and Joseph, 1994). A more plausible conclusion, therefore, is that a tendency to believe in
conspiracy theories is part of human nature and that people have been susceptible to such beliefs
throughout history. We propose a fluid, situational factor to predict such beliefs, namely, the pres-
ence versus absence of crisis situations. As each generation typically faces a range of societal crisis
situations, such as revolutions, wars, economic recessions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters,
this would explain why conspiracy theorizing has been prevalent throughout history. Furthermore,
while no research has yet studied cultural differences in conspiracy belief, our line of reasoning
suggests that possible cultural differences are likely to be attributable to variations in the extent to
which cultures experience uncertainty and fear (e.g. low- vs high-trust cultures).
Historical crises and conspiracy theories
Various major crisis events have taken place in recent history, and these events have inspired sub-
stantial conspiracy theorizing. Only recently, the world has seen economic and financial crises,
which have been associated with various conspiracy theories (e.g. the theory that the financial
crisis was caused by democratic bankers to get Obama elected in 2008). Furthermore, our world is
facing a crisis pertaining to climate change, which has elicited a climate change denial movement,
and conspiracy theories, suggesting that climate change is a hoax. Various wars were fought (e.g.
326 Memory Studies 10(3)
Iraq and Afghanistan), and the motives to participate in these wars have been questioned in con-
spiracy theories, suggesting a prominent role of oil companies in secret political decision-making.
Finally, the 9/11 terrorist attacks have produced conspiracy theories, suggesting that the attacks
were an inside job or that the US government deliberately failed to prevent the attacks (Dunbar and
Reagan, 2011). Thus, many crisis situations took place, and almost invariably, these crisis situa-
tions led large groups of citizens to embrace conspiracy theories.
While many conspiracy theories nowadays implicate governmental institutions (e.g. the CIA)
or major companies (e.g. the pharmaceutical industry), various other societal groups have also
frequently been implicated in conspiracy theories. One group that has often been accused of
conspiracy formation is the Jewish population. Jewish conspiracy theories--suggesting, for
instance, that there is a Jewish plot to achieve world domination--still fuel anti-Semitism in
various parts of the world, such as Malaysia (Swami, 2012), Turkey (Nefes, 2015), and Poland
(Golec de Zavala and Cichocka, 2012). Such conspiratorial anti-Semitism is a recurring issue
throughout history. Back in the 1930s and 1940s, Jewish conspiracy theories were a major part
of Hitler's speeches and a potent force in inspiring the Holocaust (Snyder, 2015). For instance,
Hitler blamed the German defeat in World War I (WWI) on a Jewish conspiracy. Furthermore,
he believed that Soviet communism was a Jewish conspiracy, a theory commonly referred to as
"Judeo-Bolshevism." Somewhat ironically, Joseph Stalin entertained similar conspiracy theo-
ries, suggesting that the Jews were responsible for the rise of Nazism (for details on Jewish
conspiracy theories shortly before and during World War II (WWII), see Pipes, 1997). Also in
Medieval times, the European Jewish population was a target of conspiracy theorizing, including
being blamed for setbacks during the Crusades and for causing disease epidemics, such as plague
(Brotherton, 2015).
Even back in the Roman era, there are prominent examples of conspiracy theories, and these
are typically connected to major crisis situations. During the year AD 64, the great fire of Rome
erupted. Aided by the wind and the wooden construction of the houses, the fire lasted for almost
a week, transforming Rome into an inferno. Once the fire stopped, most of Rome was destroyed.
Many people died or were left homeless. Emperor Nero was out of town when the fire started,
and he returned to Rome to organize help for the victims. Around the same time, however, con-
spiracy theories started to spread, which asserted that Nero and his associates deliberately
started the fire in order to rebuild Rome according to his own vision. In addition, these con-
spiracy theories stated that Nero was singing while Rome was burning (for a more elaborate
description, see Brotherton, 2015). Apparently, Nero was not amused when hearing about the
conspiracy theories. In response, he came up with his own conspiracy theory, blaming the
Christian community for initiating the fire and spreading the rumors--leading many Christians
to be crucified or burned alive.1
One might reason that these examples are just anecdotes and think of examples of conspiracy
theories that appear unconnected to a specific societal crisis (e.g. the moon landings and the gov-
ernment hiding evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life). However, while these latter conspiracy
theories do not emerge from an objectively "real" crisis, they do make assumptions of a powerful
government that deceives citizens in a deliberate and highly ingenious fashion. Such conspiracy
theories therefore still originate from subjective perceptions of a nation being in crisis. More
important for the present purposes is that societal crisis situations almost invariably elicit con-
spiracy theories. These considerations suggest that conspiracy theories are initiated by the subjec-
tive thoughts and feelings that people have when confronted with societal crisis situations, such as
a fire, a disease epidemic, a war, a plane crash, or a terrorist strike. In the following section, we
examine the psychological literature to answer the question of why conspiracy theories emerge in
such contexts.
van Prooijen and Douglas 327
The psychology of conspiracy beliefs
What psychological function does believing in conspiracy theories have for perceivers, and how is
this relevant in crisis situations? Conspiracy theories provide people with simplified answers, spe-
cifically to questions of how a certain crisis situation emerged, and which societal actors can and
cannot be trusted. These answers are highly relevant for how people cope with crisis situations.
Crisis situations are likely to have the psychological effect on people that they become uncertain
or feel that they cannot control their environment anymore. Conspiracy theories address these feel-
ings by enabling precautionary actions to the alleged conspirators--leading to increased vigilance
that may be useful in exposing, combating, or avoiding the conspiracy. Put differently, a conspiracy
theory helps people to make sense of the world by specifying the causes of important events, which
further helps them predict, and anticipate, the future. Hofstadter (1966) noted that conspiracy theo-
ries help people comprehend complex events that are difficult to understand otherwise, by attribut-
ing these events to a powerful and evil enemy group. More generally, a desire to make sense of the
world is a core motive underlying belief in conspiracy theories (see also Bale, 2007). Such sense-
making is particularly likely to stimulate conspiracy beliefs in a social context that involves hostile
or ideologically dissimilar outgroups. Such a competitive intergroup setting promotes a need to be
vigilant, given that the powerful outgroup may cause more harm in the future, and conspiracy
beliefs enable perceivers to estimate what the outgroup is capable of.
It has been noted that people's motivation to make sense of their environment increases when
they feel that they are not in control of a situation or when they experience subjective feelings of
uncertainty (Van den Bos, 2009). The psychological concepts of lacking control and experiencing
subjective uncertainty are closely interrelated, and both describe the aversive experience of being
in situations where it is unclear what the future may hold. Such experiences are threatening, as
people have a basic need to experience a certain level of control over their environment and to
know what to expect from that environment. Feelings of control and certainty enable people to
effectively navigate the world by successfully seizing on opportunities, avoiding threats, and mak-
ing good choices that contribute constructively to one's wellbeing. When people are anxious and
uncertain, they seek to restore control through enhanced cognitive activity to increase comprehen-
sion of the situation that they find themselves in (see also Park, 2010). Put differently, when people
experience such aversive feelings, they engage in increased sense-making activities in order to
imbue a situation with meaning and purpose.
If belief in conspiracy theories is a way of making sense of a situation, it follows that such
beliefs are increasingly likely to the extent that people experience uncertainty or a lack of control.
This assertion would provide an explanation for why conspiracy theories emerge in societal crisis
situations: People often experience such situations as uncontrollable, and hence, they are a cause
of substantial uncertainty and anxiety among citizens. Moreover, it is often easy to connect societal
crises to the purposeful misdeeds of hostile groups, making it likely that many citizens consider the
possibility of secret conspiracy formation. In a seminal psychological experiment, one group of
research participants read a scenario where a president was shot and killed. Another group of par-
ticipants read the same scenario with one difference, namely, the assassin missed and the president
survived. Subsequently, participants were asked to what extent they believed that a conspiratorial
network was behind the attack: Was the assassination (attempt) the work of a lone wolf or of a
conspiracy? Results revealed that when the president was killed, people were more likely to believe
a conspiracy was behind the attack than when the president survived (McCauley and Jacques,
1979). Other studies found further support for such "consequence-cause matching" in conspiracy
beliefs, referring to the idea that people are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories to the
extent that the consequences of an event are more harmful. For instance, LeBoeuf and Norton
328 Memory Studies 10(3)
(2012) found that a political assassination was more likely attributed to a conspiracy if it led to a
war than if it did not lead to a war. Such consequence-cause matching in conspiracy beliefs is due
to an increased motivation to make sense of the event (Van Prooijen and Van Dijk, 2014).
These studies suggest that specific impactful societal events--such as the assassination of a
president--produce specific conspiracy theories (i.e. about the assassination). Feelings of uncer-
tainty, and the fear of being out of control, also appear to predict a more general tendency to
explain events that happen in the world through conspiracy theories, however, including conspir-
acy theories that are conceptually unrelated to the source of uncertainty (e.g. Kossowska and
Bukowski, 2015). For instance, research suggests that people who have a relatively strong external
locus of control--which is a structural tendency to attribute one's own successes and failures to
factors that are out of one's own control--are more likely to report high levels of interpersonal
mistrust, paranoia, and belief in conspiracy theories (Hamsher et al., 1968; Mirowsky and Ross,
1983). Likewise, people who feel powerless are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories
(Abalakina-Paap et al., 1999; Imhoff and Bruder, 2014), as are people who strongly experience
fear of death (Newheiser et al., 2011).
The above-mentioned findings are correlational, and hence, these studies do not reveal whether
uncertainty causes conspiracy beliefs, or vice versa. In experimental psychological research, how-
ever, researchers have attempted to establish causality: Does the experience of lacking control, or
subjective feelings of uncertainty, increase belief in conspiracy theories? To examine this question,
various studies have attempted to induce these feelings in research participants. An example is a
study by Whitson and Galinsky (2008), in which one group of research participants wrote down a
past experience where they felt that they personally lacked control. Compared to other partici-
pants--who had written about a less threatening experience--these participants were subsequently
more likely to believe in conspiracy theories that were unrelated to the out-of-control experience
(for other illustrations, see Sullivan et al., 2010; Van Prooijen and Acker, 2015). Likewise, other
studies asked participants to describe a situation in their life where they felt uncertain. Such an
uncertainty induction subsequently increased belief in conspiracy theories about various societal
issues, provided that the relevant authorities were considered immoral (Van Prooijen and Jostmann,
2013; see also Van Prooijen, 2016). Taken together, these findings suggest that lacking control, or
subjective uncertainty, often increases people's tendency to believe in conspiracy theories.
The relationship between uncertainty and conspiracy beliefs has substantial implications for
understanding how people psychologically cope with adversity in their everyday life. For instance,
Crocker et al. (1999) investigated conspiracy beliefs among societal minority groups (i.e. African
Americans). Their findings reveal that minority group members who face real problems--such as
racial discrimination--are more likely than majority group members to attribute these problems to
conspiracies. Furthermore, Van Prooijen and De Vries (2016) investigated organizational conspir-
acy beliefs: What factors predict whether or not employees suspect their managers of conspiring
toward evil goals? Results of their study revealed that feelings of job insecurity--that is, uncer-
tainty about whether one's job will continue to exist in the future--was a main predictor of such
organizational conspiracy beliefs (see also Douglas and Leite, 2016, for studies on conspiracy
beliefs in organizations). These findings underscore that in a variety of settings, subjectively expe-
riencing uncertainty or powerlessness is a recipe for conspiracy beliefs.
While conspiracy beliefs are a response to anxiety and uncertainty, it is not a given that they
actually help to reduce such feelings. In fact, research reveals that exposure to conspiracy theories
increases feelings of powerlessness, which, in turn, leads to a variety of maladaptive behavioral
intentions, such as withdrawal from politics, a decreased willingness to reduce one's carbon foot-
print (in response to climate conspiracy belief), and a decreased willingness to have a child vacci-
nated (in response to vaccine conspiracy beliefs; Jolley and Douglas, 2014a, 2014b; see also
van Prooijen and Douglas 329
Douglas and Sutton, 2015). Conspiracy theories also appear to influence people without their
awareness (Douglas and Sutton, 2008). We speculate here that conspiracy theories are likely to
have some psychological payoff for perceivers, for instance, by reassuring them that harmful inci-
dents do not occur at random, thereby enabling them to prepare for the dangers entailed by the
suspected conspiracy. At the same time, believing that the world is filled with evil conspiracies is
likely to invoke a host of negative emotions, which may help explain why belief in one conspiracy
theory stimulates belief in other conspiracy theories (Goertzel, 1994; Wood et al., 2012).
In sum, belief in conspiracy theories is intimately connected with feelings of fear, uncertainty,
or being out of control, and it is likely that societal crisis situations often arouse such feelings in
people. As such, these insights can explain why conspiracy theories flourish particularly in societal
crisis situations. The main underlying process for this connection is that uncertainty stimulates a
desire to make sense of one's social environment.
Implications for historical narratives
What are the implications of these psychological processes for how people remember and transmit
information about past events? Here, we propose that while conspiracy theories may originate
through the emotional processes of lacking control or feeling uncertain, at a relatively fast pace
they can become coherent narratives that shape people's representations of history (see also Hilton
and Liu, this issue). The feature of conspiracy theories that they summarize complex events into a
simplified story--typically involving a powerful enemy group (i.e. the conspiracy) that deliber-
ately organizes and carries out an evil plan-- makes such theories ideally suited for cultural trans-
mission as they are easily understood by lay people (see Bilewicz et al., this issue; Bruckmüller
et al., this issue). It has been noted that people typically make sense of past events as "lay histori-
ans" who--unlike professional historians--rarely base their conclusions on direct historical
sources. Instead, lay historians transmit historical narratives to others based on their imperfect
memory, as well as on other imperfect sources of information such as folklore, novels, films, and
the like (see Klein, 2013).
As a consequence, conspiracy theories may spread over time and become part of people's men-
tal representations of important historical events, long after the feelings of uncertainty and fear that
the events initially caused have dissipated. A case in point is the assassination of JFK on 22
November 1963 in Dallas, Texas. This event produced an instant shock in the United States and,
indeed, in the entire world. For many people, the JFK assassination continues to be a "flashbulb
memory," as they still know exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first
heard the news (see also Luminet and Spijkerman, this issue). The event also gave rise to major
conspiracy theories, making allegations that powerful groups such as the CIA, the KGB, Cuba, or
organized crime were behind the assassination. Various polls suggest that ever since this event took
place, the majority of US citizens have believed in one of the conspiracy theories about this event
(Pipes, 1997).
Of particular interest for the present purposes is how the proportion of citizens that endorsed a
JFK conspiracy theory has developed over time. Longitudinal Gallup polling revealed that, in the
3years directly after the assassination, slightly more than 50% of US citizens believed that JFK
had been murdered as part of a conspiracy (see Swift, 2013, for an overview of these Gallup
polls). It stands to reason that, after these first few years, the uncertainty and fear that were caused
by the Kennedy assassination had dissipated among the public. There were various other societal
crises going on to worry about (e.g. the Vietnam War; substantial societal changes, such as those
initiated by civil rights movements). Nevertheless, the proportion of citizens that believed in a
JFK conspiracy theory gradually increased over the years, reaching a high of 81% in 1975. In the
330 Memory Studies 10(3)
following years, up until 2003, these proportions remained consistently above 70% and peaked
again at 81% in the early 2000s. Only in recent years these numbers have started to decrease,
although they are currently still above 60%--which is higher than directly after JFK assassination
itself (Swift, 2013).
While uncertainty and fear may have contributed to the genesis of JFK conspiracy theories back
in 1963, it is difficult to account for these numbers through these emotional processes. There has
been variation in the number of crises throughout the past few decades that citizens encountered
(e.g. economic recession vs prosperity; war vs peace), but this waxing and waning of societal crises
are not visible in the Gallup figures (Swift, 2013). Furthermore, taking into account that the figures
are very high also in recent years, it is quite likely that many people who were not even born in
1963 endorse a JFK conspiracy theory. Instead, we propose that conspiracy theories can become
coherent historical narratives that are transmitted to future generations as if they were facts, even
if the actual facts do not provide compelling evidence for the conspiracy theory. What starts as a
psychological response to cope with distressing feelings can become part of people's representa-
tions of history.
Not all conspiracy theories make history this way, and in fact, the plausibility that people accord
to certain conspiracy theories can also decrease over time as a function of new insights. For
instance, it was common for citizens to believe that many young women conspired as witches with
the Devil back in the seventeenth century, and this conspiracy theory in all likelihood emerged
through similar processes as other conspiracy theories discussed in this article. Nevertheless, it is
a safe guess that few modern European citizens would endorse such beliefs today (although com-
parable witchcraft conspiracy theories are still common in other parts of the world, for example,
parts of Africa; West and Sanders, 2003). In a similar vein, we can only speculate as to how JFK
conspiracy theories will develop in the future--particularly when the final classified documents
about this incident are released to the public. Be that as it may, our conclusion is that while con-
spiracy theories are initially based on the emotional experiences associated with imminent crisis
situations, they may soon after stabilize into coherent narratives that are part of how people remem-
ber the past.
Concluding remarks
This contribution sought to examine the relationship between societal crisis situations and belief in
conspiracy theories. Building on an integration of historical observations with basic psychological
research, we can draw the following conclusions. First, conspiracy theories are not unique to our
current time or culture. People of all eras and cultures are likely to believe in conspiracy theories,
provided that they are confronted with societal crisis situations. Second, this relationship between
societal crisis situations and belief in conspiracy theories is attributable to feelings of fear, uncer-
tainty, and being out of control. These feelings instigate sense-making processes that increase the
likelihood that people perceive conspiracies in their social environment. Third, after being formed,
conspiracy theories can become part of lay representations of history and are transmitted to new
generations as coherent narratives even though people do not experience uncertainty about past
crisis situations anymore. Taken together, these processes might explain why human history is
replete with widespread belief in conspiracy theories.
