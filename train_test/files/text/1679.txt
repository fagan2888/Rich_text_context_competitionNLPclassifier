A Swedish version of the National Geographic Smell Survey (Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989) was completed by 227
twin pairs from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Twins ranged in age from 45 to 89 years. Quantita-
tive genetic analysis of four measures of olfactory functioning indicated moderate heritability for odor identifica-
tion and perceived intensity and nonsignificant heritability for odor detection and perceived pleasantness.
Bivariate analyses revealed that the relationship between odor identification and measures of verbal ability was
primarily genetically mediated. The results provided further support for the hypothesis that odor identification
and verbal ability in general tap the same cognitive domain (Larsson, 1997).
OST research in cognitive psychology has concen-
trated on visual and, to some extent, auditory presen-
tation of information. Over the past decade, however, a
growing body of research has focused on the perceptual and
cognitive components of the sense of smell. Individuals dif-
fer in their ability to detect odors (Van Toller, Dodd, & Bill-
ing, 1985; Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989) and to identify or label
odors (Russell et al, 1993; Schemper, Voss, & Cain, 1981).
Furthermore, there are significant age differences in these
abilities, as well as in recognition memory for odors over
various delay intervals (for a review, see Larsson, 1997).
The nature of these individual differences and age differ-
ences has yet to be explained. The primary objective of the
present investigation was to apply quantitative genetic
methods to individual differences in olfactory functioning
in a sample of healthy older adults.
Olfactory Functioning
One method for investigating individual differences in
various olfactory functions is the twin study. Comparing the
similarity of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs
allows researchers to determine the extent to which the vari-
ance in a trait (e.g., odor detection) arises from genetic or
environmental factors. Previous twin studies of olfactory
functioning have focused primarily on detection of individ-
ual odors. Several twin and family studies have demon-
strated a genetic basis for specific anosmias, the inability to
detect a certain odor (Amoore & Steinle, 1991; Whissell-
Buechy & Amoore, 1973; Wysocki & Beauchamp, 1984,
1991). For example, Wysocki and Beauchamp (1991) dem-
onstrated that the specific anosmia to androstenone, a ste-
roid metabolite produced by many mammals, has a signifi-
cant genetic component.
In contrast, few twin studies have investigated genetic
and environmental influences on variation in olfactory func-
tioning in the normal range. Hubert, Fabsitz, Feinleib, and
Brown (1980) found no evidence for heritability of olfac-
tory sensitivity to three odorants: acetic acid (pungent),
isobutric acid (sweaty), and cyclohexanone (camphora-
ceous). Although MZ correlations were not significantly
greater than DZ correlations for any of the odorants, the
data for acetic acid were suggestive. Using a different set of
odorants, Gross-Isseroff, Ophir, Bartana, Voet, and Lancet
(1992) found significantly greater MZ than DZ similarity
for androstenone and isoamyl acetate (banana) but not for
citral (lemon) or eugenol (cloves). Finally, Segal, Topolski,
Wilson, Brown, and Araki (1995) reported no difference in
MZ and DZ twin correlations for detection of a single odor-
ant (phenyl ethyl alcohol). Thus, the evidence for genetic
and environmental influences on odor detection is inconsis-
tent across odorants.
Measures of odor detection (can you smell it?) princi-
pally reflect sensory processes, whereas measures of odor
identification (what is it?) reflect both sensory and cognitive
processes (Wijk & Cain, 1994). In an important departure
from previous investigations, Segal and colleagues (1995)
also reported twin correlations for performance on an odor
identification task. Segal and her colleagues administered
the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test
(UPSIT) to 45 MZ pairs and 37 DZ pairs ranging in age
from 11 to 83 years. The UPSIT is a standardized test of
odor identification that requires participants to label 40
odorants presented in a multiple-choice format (Doty, Sha-
man, & Dann, 1984). The MZ correlation of .31 was not
significantly greater than the DZ correlation of .15; how-
ever, the results are suggestive of a genetic contribution to
odor identification.
One advantage of scales like the UPSIT is the increase in
reliable variance that results from summing performance
across several items. In a twin study, the result is increased
power to detect genetic influences. Previous twin studies of
odor detection have produced results that vary widely;
M
OLFACTORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING P227
therefore, in the present investigation we chose to summa-
rize responses across six odorants to create scales. The first
goal of the investigation was to examine genetic and envi-
ronmental contributions to individual differences on four
measures of olfactory functioning: odor detection, odor
identification, perceived pleasantness, and perceived inten-
sity of the olfactory information. Perception of pleasantness
and intensity are classic components of investigations of ol-
factory functioning (e.g., Doty, Orndorff, Leyden, & Klig-
man, 1978; Jones, Roberts, & Holman, 1978; Wysocki &
Gilbert, 1989); however, to date these variables have not
been included in a twin study of olfactory functioning.
Relationship With Cognitive Abilities
Odor identification marks the point at which the bottom-
up process of sensory functioning and the top-down process
of cognitive abilities intersect (Richardson & Zucco, 1989).
According to Schab (1991), odor identification is a semantic
memory task: The participant is required to access the ap-
propriate label for the odorant. In contrast, odor recognition
taps episodic memory: Participants are presented with a set
of odorants and later asked to decide which test odorants
were presented before. Investigations of odor recognition
memory grew out of an interest in the ability of certain
odors to evoke vivid memories. Marked age differences in
episodic odor recognition memory have been demonstrated
(Larsson, 1997). Evidence has suggested that the age differ-
ences in odor recognition result in large part from age dif-
ferences in cognitive abilities, specifically semantic mem-
ory. In two separate studies, Larsson and Bäckman (1993,
1997) demonstrated that age-related differences in odor rec-
ognition memory were eliminated when odor identification
(a semantic memory task) was statistically controlled.
Odor identification may play a fundamental role in olfac-
tory functioning and odor memory. Little evidence exists,
however, about the relationship between odor identification
and measures of cognitive abilities. Research has indicated
that sensory deficits alone cannot explain age differences in
odor identification (Larsson & Bäckman, 1993, 1997; Mur-
phy, Cain, Gilmore, & Skinner, 1991). For example, even
after screening participants to ensure equivalent perfor-
mance on measures of odor sensitivity, Schemper and col-
leagues (1981) still found age differences in the ability to
identify a set of 40 odorants. Consequently, cognitive fac-
tors must play a role (Richardson & Zucco, 1989; Schab,
1991). Larsson, Finkel, and Pedersen (2000) reported sig-
nificant correlations between odor identification and cogni-
tive abilities--particularly those cognitive measures with a
strong verbal component.
The second goal of the present investigation was an ex-
amination of the nature of the relationship between odor
identification and cognitive abilities. In the present analysis,
quantitative genetic methods were used to determine the rel-
ative contribution of age, genes, and environments to the re-
lationship between olfactory functioning and cognition. The
correlation could arise from a variety of genetic and envi-
ronmental influences. If, for example, the genetic influences
on odor identification and cognition were correlated, one
could conclude that the association arises through a geneti-
cally influenced mechanism, such as that influencing verbal
functioning. If, however, only the environmental influences
on odor identification and cognition were correlated, this
would suggest that something in the environment had pro-
duced the relationship. The environmental effect could be
shared by family members, for example, when parents pro-
vide an intellectually stimulating rearing. In contrast, the
environmental effect could be specific to an individual, such
as lifestyle variables or a neurological trauma affecting both
odor identification and cognitive ability. Thus, not only the
existence of the relationship between odor identification
and cognition but also potential mechanisms producing this
relationship can be investigated. Understanding the nature
of the correlation between odor identification and cognition
will improve understanding of the nature of age differences
in olfactory functioning.
In sum, our goals in the present investigation were two-
fold. First, we used univariate quantitative genetic analysis
to determine genetic and environmental influences on four
measures of olfactory functioning. Second, we used bivari-
ate quantitative genetic analysis to determine the contribu-
tions of age, genes, and environment to the correlation be-
tween olfactory functioning and cognitive measures. To
address these goals, data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin
Study of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et al., 1991) were ana-
lyzed. A Swedish version of the National Geographic Smell
Survey (Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989) was completed by 227
twin pairs ranging in age from 45 to 89 years.
METHODS
Participants
Ascertainment procedures for SATSA have been de-
scribed previously (Pedersen et al., 1991). In brief, the sam-
ple is a subset of twins from the population-based Swedish
Twin Registry (Cederlöf & Lorich, 1978). The base popula-
tion of twins consists of all pairs of twins who indicated that
they had been separated before the age of 11 and reared
apart and a sample of twins reared together, matched on the
basis of gender and date and county of birth (Pedersen, Fri-
berg, Floderus-Myrhed, McClearn, & Plomin, 1984). Al-
though twins were labeled reared apart if they were sepa-
rated by age 11, the distribution of age at separation is
highly skewed. Fifty-two percent of the reared-apart twins
were separated before age 1 year, 69% by age 2 years, and
82% by age 5 years (Pedersen et al., 1991). Pedersen, Plo-
min, Nesselroade, and McClearn (1992) found little or no
effect of either age of separation or correlated rearing envi-
ronments on twin similarity for cognitive abilities for the
reared-apart SATSA twins. Twins were first mailed ques-
tionnaires, and a sample of those pairs in which both twins
responded was invited to participate in an examination of
cognitive abilities, which occurred in person. In-person test-
ing took place in a location convenient to the twins, such as
district nurses' offices, health-care schools, and long-term
care clinics (Pedersen et al., 1991). Testing was completed
during a 4-hr visit that involved cognitive testing and a
health examination.
Demographic characteristics of the sample for the present
analyses are presented in Table 1. Zygosity was determined
on the basis of serological assay. The sample included 31
P228 FINKEL ET AL.
pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart (MZA), 55 pairs of
monozygotic twins reared together (MZT), 72 pairs of dizy-
gotic twins reared apart (DZA), and 69 pairs of dizygotic
twins reared together (DZT). Participants ranged in age
from 45 to 89 years. There were significant differences in
the gender distribution between zygosity groups, 2(3, N 
454)  9.98, p  .05. With the exception of DZA pairs, ap-
proximately half the respondents were women. With 68%
female pairs, the gender distribution of DZA pairs more
nearly matched the demographic characteristics of this age
range. Education was rated on a 4-point scale, and the aver-
age education score fell between 1 and 2, where 1 indicated
completion of elementary education and 2 indicated com-
pletion of vocational high school. Participants were asked to
rate their general health on a scale ranging from 1 (good) to
3 (bad). Use of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes was included in
the calculation of packyears (Kendler, Karkowski, & Peder-
sen, 1999). Cigars and pipes were converted to cigarette
equivalents (e.g., 1 cigar  4 cigarettes). There were no sig-
nificant differences in mean age, mean education, mean
self-rated health, or mean packyears between zygosity
groups.
Measures
Olfactory measures.--Twins participating in SATSA
were mailed a series of questionnaires in 1990 assessing
health, personality, and lifestyle variables, including smok-
ing behavior. At that time, twins received a Swedish version
of the National Geographic Smell Survey (Wysocki & Gil-
bert, 1989). In the Swedish version, a translation of the
questions was attached to the original National Geographic
scratch-and-sniff forms. The Smell Survey was mailed to
606 individuals, and a total of 532 (88%) completed surveys
were returned. Of the 606 surveys sent out, 454 (75%) were
returned from pairs in which both twins participated. The
survey included a set of six microencapsulated odorants
chosen to represent a range of pleasantness, familiarity, and
food relatedness. Two odorants were food related: isoamyl
acetate, a banana- or pearlike fruity odor, and eugenol, a
major component of clove oil. A pleasant, nonfood aroma
was provided by synthetic rose. A mixture of mercaptans
(sulfurous compounds added to natural gas as a warning
odor) provided an unpleasant, nonfood odor. The two final
odors were musk related. Androstenone is a volatile steroid
metabolite produced by many mammals; it can smell of ei-
ther musk or urine. Galaxolide is a synthetic musk widely
used in commercial perfumes.
Respondents were asked to scratch and sniff a panel con-
taining each odorant and answer several questions, includ-
ing "Did you smell something (yes or no)?" "Did it smell
good or bad?" "How intense is this odor?" The questions
concerning perceived pleasantness and perceived intensity
were answered on a 5-point scale ranging from good to bad
and from weak to strong, respectively. Respondents were
also asked to identify the odorant by responding to the ques-
tion "Which word best describes this odor?" Response op-
tions were floral, musk, urine, foul, ink, spice, wood, fruit,
burnt, sweet, and other (if other, what?). The descriptors
were chosen to provide generic-level, nonoverlapping des-
ignations of odor quality (Russell and colleagues, 1993;
Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989). Odor identification was scored
by using the standard answers identified by Wysocki and
Gilbert (1989). If respondents provided a veridical label for
the odorant, their responses were counted as correct. Also, if
a participant emitted a near-miss label such as banana candy
for amyl acetate, it was coded as correct. If respondents de-
tected an odorant but proved unable to identify it, then their
identification responses were scored as incorrect. Data for
each question were summarized across odorants to obtain
four measures: number of odorants detected (odor detec-
tion), number of odorants correctly identified (odor identifi-
cation), mean perceived pleasantness, and mean perceived
intensity.
Cognitive measures.--The SATSA cognitive test bat-
tery includes 11 cognitive measures drawn from various
sources and chosen to assess four areas of cognitive ability
(Pedersen et al., 1992). Verbal ability is tapped by tests of
Information, Synonyms, and Analogies. Figure Logic,
Block Design, and Card Rotations assess spatial abilities.
Memory tests include Digit Span, Thurstone's Picture
Memory, and Names and Faces. Finally, perceptual speed is
measured by Digit Symbol and Figure Identification. Reli-
abilities for these tests range from .82 to .96. A measure of
general cognitive ability was also created by obtaining indi-
viduals' scores on the first principal component of all the
measures (as in Pedersen et al., 1992). All measures loaded
higher than .50 on the first principal component, which ac-
counted for 48% of the total variance.
Statistical Method
The basic assumptions underlying the twin design are
that (a) the shared environmental factors that produce simi-
larities among twin pairs are the same for the MZ and DZ
twin pairs, (b) there is no assortative mating on the traits of
interest, and (c) there are no nonadditive genetic effects.
Previous research with SATSA data have indicated that
these assumptions are not violated in that sample (Pedersen

OLFACTORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING P229
et al., 1992). When these assumptions are met, the total
variance in a trait is typically divided into three compo-
nents: genetic effects, shared environmental effects, and
nonshared environmental effects. Shared environmental
factors make family members more similar to each other,
whereas nonshared environmental factors make family
members less similar to each other. When the sample in-
cludes twins reared together and twins reared apart, how-
ever, the rearing environment can be modeled more pre-
cisely. We can differentiate between rearing environmental
effects and the effects of environmental factors that happen
to be correlated for twins regardless of their rearing status.
In the current analyses, then, the total variance was divided
into components explained by four separate influences: ad-
ditive genetic effects (Va), correlated environmental effects
(Vc), shared rearing environmental effects (Vs), and non-
shared environmental effects including error (Vns). The
phenotypic covariance between twins, assuming the four
components of variance are uncorrelated, can be expressed
as in the following equations for monozygotic twins reared
together (MZT), monozygotic twin reared apart (MZA),
dizygotic twins reared together (DZT), and dizygotic twin
reared apart (DZA):
where covMZT represents the covariance between MZT
twins. MZ twins share all their genetic material; thus, they
have all of their genetic variance in common. DZ twins
share, on average, one half of their segregating genes so that
they have only half of their genetic variance in common.
Correlated environmental effects add to the similarity of all
twin pairs regardless of rearing status or zygosity. Twins
reared in the same household will have in common all of the
rearing environmental variance, whereas twins reared apart
share no rearing environmental variance. The covariance
between the nonshared environmental factors for any two
individuals is, by definition, zero, thus the Vns term is not
included in the covariance equations.
By fitting structural models to the observed MZA, MZT,
DZA, and DZT covariance matrices, we can estimate the
proportion of total phenotypic variance accounted for by the
variance in genetic factors (i.e., heritability), shared envi-
ronment factors, correlated environment factors, and non-
shared environment factors, respectively. Covariance matri-
ces were subjected to multivariate model fitting procedures,
using LISREL 8 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993). Tests of sub-
sets of the structural model were conducted to determine
whether the fit of the model to the data was significantly re-
duced when one or more of the paths was removed from the
model (Neale, Heath, Hewitt, Eaves, & Fulker, 1989). Sig-
nificant reduction in model fit is indicated by a significant
change in chi-square value.
To investigate the relationship between olfactory func-
tioning and cognitive abilities, a standard Cholesky bivari-
ate model (Neale & Cardon, 1992) was implemented. As
shown in Figure 1, the model includes genetic, correlated
environmental, shared rearing environmental, and non-

shared environmental influences on cognitive ability and
separate genetic and environmental influences specific to
olfactory functioning. The diagonal paths from the genetic
and environmental influences for cognitive ability to olfac-
tory functioning generate the Cholesky decomposition of
the correlation between olfactory functioning and cognitive
functioning. Paths from the latent age variable to both cog-
nitive and olfactory functioning allow for the estimation of
age variance in both traits. In total, the model permits the
estimation of age, genetic, and environmental components
of the correlation between cognitive ability and olfactory
functioning.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Mean performance on the four measures of olfactory
functioning is presented in Table 1. There were no signifi-
cant differences in the measures between zygosity groups.
The mean number of odorants detected by respondents was
5.33 (SD  0.95). Respondents correctly identified an aver-
age of 2.49 (SD  1.11) of the odorants. In their analysis of
the 1.2 million responses to the National Geographic Smell
Survey, Wysocki and Gilbert (1989) reported that respon-
dents between the ages of 40 and 80 correctly identified be-
tween 2 and 3 odorants. Perceived pleasantness in the
SATSA sample averaged 2.46 (SD  0.51). Mean per-
ceived intensity was 3.11 (SD  0.66). In the National Geo-
graphic sample, mean perceived intensity ranged from 3.2
to 3.8 for adults aged 40 to 80 (Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989).
Perceived intensity is an idiosyncratic measure. Minor dif-
ferences between the National Geographic sample and the
SATSA sample may result from cultural differences (e.g.,
Barber, 1997), variations in the actual strength of the odor-
ants due to aging of the test forms, or random error.
All variables were corrected for the effect of sex and
smoking history by regressing the variables on sex and
packyears and then using the residual score for subsequent
analyses. In their analysis of these data, Larsson and associ-
ates (2000) found no reliable influence of sex on the olfac-

nitive ability and olfactory functioning. Paths from the latent age

tory measures, although gender, favoring women, proved to
be marginally influential for odor identification. In the cal-
culation of phenotypic and intraclass correlations, variables
were corrected for the effects of age, as well. Age was in-
corporated in the quantitative genetic model; therefore, for
the genetic analyses, variables were corrected for sex and
packyears only. Two types of quantitative genetic analyses
were conducted: univariate analysis of olfactory functioning
and bivariate analysis of the relationship between olfactory
functioning and cognitive abilities.
Univariate Analysis
The first step in the univariate genetic analysis was to ex-
amine the intraclass correlations, which are presented in Ta-
ble 2. If the MZ twin correlation is greater than the DZ twin
correlation, then genetic effects are indicated. If the DZ cor-
relation is greater than half the MZ correlation, then corre-
lated environmental effects are indicated. If correlations for
twins reared together are greater than correlations for twins
reared apart, then rearing environmental effects are indi-
cated. Examination of the correlations presented in Table 2
indicated some evidence for genetic effects on all four mea-
sures of olfactory functioning. In each case, the MZ correla-
tion was greater than the DZ correlation. Only three of the
correlations were significantly greater than zero, however,
and the difference between MZ and DZ correlations did not
attain significance. The pattern of correlations provided lit-
tle evidence of rearing environment or correlated environ-
ment effects.
Patterns evident in the intraclass correlations were further
examined through quantitative genetic analysis of the co-
variance matrices, and the results are presented in Figure 2.
The total variance in each measure of olfactory functioning
was divided into variance explained by age, genetic factors,
shared rearing environmental factors, and nonshared envi-
ronmental factors. Correlated environmental effects did not
contribute to the variance in any of the measures of olfac-
tory functioning. Age accounted for only 1% of the variance
in odor identification and perceived pleasantness. Age ex-
plained 2% of the variance in perceived intensity. The influ-
ence of genetic factors was modest for all four measures of
olfactory functioning, ranging from 14% for odor detection
to 29% for odor identification.
After correcting for age variance, the heritabilities for the
four measures of olfactory functioning were .14 for odor de-
tection, .29 for odor identification, .17 for perceived pleas-
antness, and .25 for perceived intensity. Dropping the ge-
netic parameter from the quantitative genetic model and
assessing the change in model fit tested the significance of
the heritability estimates. Results indicated significant heri-
tability for odor identification, 2(1)  4.45, p  .05, and
a marginally significant heritability for perceived intensity,
2(1)  2.97, p  .10. The heritability of odor detection
and perceived pleasantness failed to attain significance.
Bivariate Analysis
We began the bivariate analysis by examining the pheno-
typic correlations between the four measures of olfactory
functioning and the 12 cognitive measures included in
SATSA, presented in Table 3. Both olfactory functioning
and cognitive measures were corrected for age, sex, and
packyears. Of the 10 correlations that attained significance
at the .05 level, 8 involved odor identification. For the most
part, odor identification correlated with those cognitive

measures having a strong verbal component: Information,
Synonyms, Analogies, and Thurstone's Picture Memory.
Using principal-components analysis, these four measures
were combined into a verbal factor. The cognitive measures
were corrected for age and packyears before being entered
into the principal-components analysis. The analysis re-
sulted in a single factor that explained 62% of the total vari-
ance. Factor loadings for the four cognitive measures were
.82 for Information, .89 for Synonyms, .76 for Analogies,
and .64 for Thurstone's Picture Memory. The correlations
between the verbal factor and the four measures of olfactory
functioning are also presented in Table 3. As expected, the
verbal factor was strongly correlated with odor identifica-
tion. In addition, there was a modest correlation between the
verbal factor and perceived pleasantness.
The next step was to examine the cross-twin, cross-trait
correlations between odor identification and the relevant
cognitive measures. A cross-twin, cross-trait correlation is
the correlation of Trait 1 (odor identification) in Twin A
with Trait 2 (cognitive ability) in Twin B. The same logic
used in the examination of univariate intraclass twin corre-
lations was applied to the examination of the bivariate
cross-twin, cross-trait correlations presented in Table 4. For
example, if the MZ cross-twin correlation is greater than the
DZ cross-twin correlation, then there is evidence for genetic
mediation of the correlation between the two traits. The pat-
tern of cross-twin correlations for Synonyms, Analogies,
the verbal factor, and to some extent general cognitive abil-
ity suggest a genetic contribution to the phenotypic correla-
tion. The pattern of correlations found for the other cogni-
tive measures was unclear.
The quantitative genetic model presented in Figure 1 was
fit to the bivariate covariance matrices, and the results are
presented in Figure 3. The correlations between odor identi-
fication and the relevant cognitive measures were divided
into contributions by age, genetic factors, shared rearing en-
viromental factors, and nonshared environmental factors.
The univariate analysis provided no evidence for an influ-
ence of correlated environment on odor identification;
therefore, the correlated environmental component could
not logically contribute to the correlation between odor
identification and the cognitive measures. As a conse-
quence, the diagonal path from the correlated environmental
component for cognition to olfactory functioning (see Fig-
ure 1) was not included in the model. Results indicated that
age made a minimal contribution to the correlation for only
five of the variables: Analogies, Digit Symbol, Block De-
sign, Digit Span, and Thurstone's Picture Memory. The cor-
relations between odor identification and all but two of the
cognitive measures arose primarily from genetic factors.
The two exceptions were Information and Digit Span. The
correlation between odor identification and Information re-
sulted entirely from environmental factors, and the correla-
tion between odor identification and Digit Span resulted
from both genetic and environmental factors.
The correlations between odor identification and the two
summary cognitive measures, general cognitive ability and
the verbal factor, were primarily genetically mediated. Fur-
thermore, in the bivariate path model including either gen-
eral cognitive ability or the verbal factor, all of the genetic
variance on odor identification came through the cognitive
measure. In other words, there was no genetic variance for
odor identification that was independent of genetic variance
for the cognitive measures.
DISCUSSION
The goals of the present investigation were a univariate
genetic analysis of olfactory functioning and a bivariate ge-
netic analysis of the relationship between olfactory and cog-
nitive functioning. The univariate analysis indicated at most
moderate heritability for odor identification (.29) and per-
ceived intensity (.25). Similarly, the twin correlations re-
ported by Segal and colleagues (1995) suggested a heritabil-
ity of approximately .30 for odor identification. The mean
age of the twins in their sample was 26, 40 years younger

than the mean age of the present sample. It appears that
there is little change in the heritability of odor identification
throughout the adult lifespan; however, more data are
needed to verify this conclusion. Longitudinal twin data on
olfactory functioning would provide the most accurate in-
vestigation of possible age trends in genetic influences on
olfactory functioning. In the absence of longitudinal data,
twin data on odor identification in middle adulthood would
allow us to test the hypothesis that heritability of odor iden-
tification is stable across several age cohorts in adulthood.
Heritability estimates for odor detection and perceived
pleasantness, in contrast to those for odor identification,
failed to attain significance in the present study. Measures
of perceived pleasantness attempt to assess the idiosyncratic
hedonic experience of olfactory functioning. It is not sur-
prising, then, that most of the variance in perceived pleas-
antness can be attributed to nonshared environmental influ-
ences. The absence of significant genetic variance for odor
detection is more difficult to interpret. The evidence for ge-
netic and environmental influences on odor detection from
previous studies was inconsistent across odorants. In the
present investigation, odor detection performance was summed
across six odorants commonly used in investigations of ol-
factory functioning. However, participants detected on
average five of the six odorants. Consequently, the total
variance in odor detection performance may have been re-
stricted, diminishing our power to detect significant genetic
variance. A more powerful assessment of odor detection
would involve administration of increasing concentrations
of the test odorants. Segal and colleagues (1995) used this
method to assess detection of a single odorant and found no
difference in MZ and DZ correlations. Replication of their
study, incorporating detection of several odorants, might
provide sufficient power to detect reliable genetic influ-
ences on odor detection.
The majority of the variance in olfactory functioning in
the second half of the lifespan was explained by environ-
mental factors, predominantly nonshared environmental
factors. Although the data were corrected for the effects of
smoking--one possible nonshared environmental influence
on olfactory functioning--many other potential environ-
mental factors have been proposed. Diseases such as central
nervous system disorders, diabetes, stroke, and epilepsy
may affect olfactory functioning (Murphy, 1999; Savic,
Bookheimer, Fried, & Engel, 1997; Settle, 1986). In their
analysis of data from SATSA, Larsson and associates
(2000) found that central nervous system disorders were re-
liably related to impairments in odor detection, and epilepsy
was associated with impaired odor identification. Lifestyle
factors may also be a source of nonshared environmental in-
fluences. Corwin, Loury, and Gilbert (1995) reported that
olfactory functioning was significantly affected by occupa-
tional experience. Factory workers demonstrated signifi-
cantly impaired odor detection and lower self-ratings of ol-
factory ability as compared with office workers and those in
other occupations.
Investigation of the relationship between cognitive abili-
ties and olfactory functioning indicated strong positive cor-
relations between measures of verbal ability and odor iden-
tification (Larsson et al., 2000). The specificity of this
relationship was indicated by the absence of significant cor-
relations for other measures of cognitive abilities (spatial
abilities, short-term memory) and other measures of olfac-
tory functioning (odor detection, perceived pleasantness,
and perceived intensity). A significant correlation between
Digit Symbol and odor identification was also found. Al-
though the relationship between perceptual speed and odor
identification may not be readily apparent, research has in-
dicated that the olfactory system is extremely slow relative
to other sensory modalities (Herz & Engen, 1996; Laing &
MacLeod, 1992). Thus, faster perceptual speed may result
in better performance on measures of olfactory functioning.
Alternatively, perceptual speed may influence olfactory
functioning indirectly, through verbal ability. Evidence sug-
gests that perceptual speed mediates much of the age-related
variance in cognitive functioning (Salthouse, 1993, 1994).
Consequently, the correlation between Digit Symbol and
odor identification may reflect the underlying relationships
between perceptual speed and verbal ability and between
verbal ability and olfactory functioning.
Bivariate quantitative genetic analysis indicated that the
relationship between odor identification and cognitive abil-
ity was primarily genetically mediated. Indeed, all of the ge-
netic influences on odor identification could be attributed to
genetic influences on verbal ability. The strong genetic me-
diation of the correlation between odor identification and
verbal ability provides additional support for the hypothesis
that odor identification and verbal ability in general tap the
same cognitive domain (Larsson, 1997). The hypothesis is
further supported by the finding of Larsson and associates
(2000) that verbal ability remained a significant predictor
for odor identification performance after statistical control
of the effects of chronological age, sex, education, and glo-
bal cognitive functioning. Results of the regression analysis
(Larsson et al., 2000) and the quantitative genetic analysis
reported here indicate the pivotal role played by verbal abil-
ity in successful odor identification.
In addition, the results of the present analyses provide
some insight into the nature of age differences in olfactory
functioning. Odor identification reflects the combination of
the bottom-up process of sensory functioning and the top-
down process of cognitive abilities (Richardson & Zucco,
1989). Univariate and bivariate quantitative genetic analy-
ses reported here suggest the possibility that genetic influ-
ences on odor identification result from genetic effects on
the top-down, or cognitive, component of the process. In
contrast, environmental influences may act on the bottom-
up, or sensory, component of the process. Therefore, de-
clines in sensory functioning, per se, likely result from the
accumulated effects of nonshared environmental influences,
such as health or lifestyle variables. Declines in the cogni-
tive component of performance on some olfactory measures
may reflect genetically influenced cognitive decline. Mean
declines in cognitive ability can result from genetic factors,
even if (as our data suggest) the heritability of odor identifi-
cation remains stable. The genetic influence is on the rate of
change. Analyses of longitudinal twin data from SATSA,
for example, indicated a significant genetic influence on the
rate of decline in performance on measures of verbal ability
(Reynolds, Gatz, & Pedersen, 1998). Further research will
OLFACTORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING P233
be required to verify the differing impact of genetic and en-
vironmental influences on the components of olfactory
functioning. In addition, it will be valuable to determine
how olfactory functioning at one point in time is related to
cognitive decline and the extent to which genes mediate that
association.
