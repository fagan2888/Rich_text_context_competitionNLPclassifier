Summary
To determine whether medication use differs by cognitive status among community dwelling elderly, a survey
was made of a stratified random sample of 4110 black and white participants, aged 65 or older from the Duke
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly in five adjacent urban and rural counties in the
Piedmont area of North Carolina.
Main outcome measures were usage of prescription medications, non-prescription medications, and medicines
within therapeutic classes in the previous 2 weeks as determined during an in-home interview; and total number
of prescription and non-prescription medications used in the previous 2 weeks. Multivariate analyses, using
weighted data adjusted for sampling design, were conducted to assess the association between drug use patterns
and cognitive status, as assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, while adjusting for
demographic, health status, and access to health care factors.
Participants with cognitive impairment (13.7% of sample) were less likely to use any prescription medications
(Adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.48-0.90) or any non-prescription medications (Adjusted OR = 0.71, 95%
CI = 0.56-0.89) than cognitively intact subjects. Both groups took a similar number of prescription and
non-prescription medications. Those who were cognitively impaired were less likely to take analgesics (Adjusted
OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.52-0.83), but were more likely to take central nervous system drugs (Adjusted
OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.18-2.04) than those who were cognitively intact.
We conclude that drug use patterns by community-dwelling elderly people differ with cognitive status. Future
research needs to examine medication use by specific causes of cognitive impairment.
Introduction
Elderly people are substantial consumers of medica-
tions [1--7]. Community-based surveys reveal that they
take an average of 2.7 to 3.9 prescription and non-
prescription medications [3, 5-7]. While medications
can be beneficial in palliation and treatment of disease,
there is concern that elderly people are more prone to
drug-related problems such as inappropriate prescrib-
ing, and adverse drug reactions [1, 8--10]. Health
professionals, if knowledgeable about those factors
associated with medication use patterns, can be more
vigilant in their efforts to provide optimal pharma-
cotherapy for their elderly patients.
A number of factors are associated with increased
drug use including advanced age, female sex, white
race, poor health status and access to health care [1, 4,
7]. The association of cognitive impairment with drug
use by elderly people has not been thoroughly
investigated. The few relevant published studies have
focused primarily on people with cognitive impairment
due to dementia, and were either limited to the use of
medications by a select group of patients [11, 12] or
failed to include an adequate control group for
comparison [13].
There are several reasons why examination of the
association between medication use patterns and
cognitive impairment may be important. First, cogni-
tive impairment is disabling, stressful to family and
caregivers, costly, and common in the elderly popula-
tion [14]. Among community-dwelling participants in
the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program, severe
cognitive impairment was found in 4.9% of persons
over the age of 65, and in 15% in those 85 and older [15].
Second, among known risk factors for cognitive
impairment, one of the most common is medication
DRUG USE BY COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED ELDERLY PEOPLE 191
[14, 16-20]. Finally, there is concern that cognitively
impaired individuals may be under- or over-medicated.
Under-utilization of medications is of concern since
those who are cognitively impaired may be less able to
report symptoms that would lead to appropriate
therapy. Moreover, appropriate therapy may not be
initiated because physicians may be influenced by the
knowledge that the patient is cognitively impaired.
Over-utilization of medications by cognitively impaired
elderly people is of concern owing to the risks
associated with inappropriate prescribing and adverse
drug reactions [10, 21-23].
Given these issues and the growing number of drugs
under investigation for the treatment of dementia
[24--26], documentation of the prescribing and self-
medication patterns of cognitively impaired elderly
people is needed to guide health policy and future
clinical research. The purpose of this study was to
determine whether drug use by community-dwelling
elderly people differs with cognitive status. Specifically,
we examined the use and total number of prescription,
and non-prescription medications, and the use of
medicines within therapeutic classes among cognitively
impaired and intact elderly people.
Methods
Sample: The data used are from the in-home baseline survey
(1986-87) of the Duke site of the Established Populations for
Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Details on
the Duke EPESE study design and methodology are
presented elsewhere [27]. Briefly, the Duke EPESE is a
stratified probability household sample comprising 4162
participants who are representative of the approximately
28 000 persons over the age of 65 living in five adjacent
counties in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. One county
is urban and four are predominantly rural; 35% of the area
population are black, 64% white and 1% of other races. This
study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center
Institutional Review Board and informed consent was
obtained from each participant prior to data collection.
Data collection: Data were collected by trained interviewers
who used a comprehensive structured questionnaire during
in-person interviews to obtain information on various aspects
of the participants' physical, mental and social health and use
of health services [27]. To minimize potential problems with
under-reporting, for participants too ill or unable to provide
usable information, an appropriate proxy (i.e. the person most
familiar with the participant) was asked to provide informa-
tion. Participants were asked whether, during the previous 2
weeks, they had taken any medicines prescribed by a doctor,
or any others obtained from a store [3, 4], and if so, to show
the interviewer all these medications. The interviewer
recorded the drug name, dosage form, and the number of
dosage forms the respondent reported taking the previous
day. In addition, for prescription drugs, the interviewer
recorded from the label, the drug strength, whether the
participant's name was on the label, and whether the medicine
was prescribed to be taken regularly or as needed.
Medication data entry and management: All information was
edited for accuracy and consistency before computer entry.
Prescription drug data were coded using an updated and
modified version of the Drug Product Information Coding
System [28], and for non-prescription drugs the Iowa
Non-prescription Drug Product Information Coding
System was used [5]. These data were entered using a locally
developed computerized program [3]. The unique numeric
generic code assigned to each drug during data entry was
matched with a therapeutic category code. This therapeutic
category code allowed drugs to be assigned to one of 15 major
therapeutic classes and 75 subclasses [3, 5], that are based
upon an expanded version of the American Hospital
Formulary Services format [29]. Reliability of the drug use
data entry system was assessed by re-entering a random 5%
sample of participants, and was found to be highly satisfactory
with an error rate of 1.6% (95% CI, 0.7%-2.6%).
Outcome measures: We examined several dependent vari-
ables. We created a dichotomous variable (1 = yes, 0 = no) to
indicate any use or no use of: (1) prescription medications, (2)
non-prescription medications, and (3) medicines within each
of the major therapeutic classes and selected subclasses. We
also created quantitative variables to indicate the total number
of prescription and non-prescription medications used.
Independent variables: The primary independent variable
was cognitive status as assessed by the ten-item, Short
Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) with scoring
adjusted for race and education [30]. Participants were
divided into two groups: cognitively impaired and cognitively
intact, based on standard cut-off scores adjusted for education
and race [30]. Specifically, for those with grade school
education, whites with four or more and blacks with five or
more errors were categorized as being cognitively impaired.
Whites and blacks with any high school education are
permitted one less error and those with more than high
school education are permitted two fewer errors.
We adjusted for important covariates that may influence
the relationship between cognitive status and drug use [1, 4, 7,
14]. Demographic factors were represented by dichotomous
variables (1 = yes, 0 = no) for race, sex, and place of residence
(i.e. whether living in an urban or rural area as defined by
U.S. Bureau of the Census), and by quantitative variables for
age and education in years. Health status factors were
represented by quantitative variables that included a modified
(three-item) version of the Rosow-Breslau scale [31], and a
health index measure (higher score = poorer health) based on
physician-assessed medical impact of five self-reported
chronic conditions (heart problems, hypertension, diabetes,
stroke, and cancer) [4]. Access to health care was represented
by dichotomous variables (1 = yes, 0 = no) for participants'
Medicaid coverage status, hospitalization in the previous
year, and continuity of care (i.e. whether the same physician
was usually seen when going for care), and a quantitative
variable that measured the number of health care visits in the
12 months prior to the interview.
Statistical analysis: For purposes of analysis, all data were
weighted to adjust for the sampling design and to allow
inference to the five-county area. The analysis proceeded in
three phases. In the first phase, the data were summarized by
percentages for all covariates and those who were cognitively
impaired were compared using the x statistic with those who
were cognitively intact [32].
In the second phase, bivariate analyses were conducted
using \ and t tests to estimate the effects of cognitive status
on the dichotomous and quantitative drug usage measures
[32]. Then, multivariate analyses, adjusting for covariates,
were conducted using logistic regression to estimate the
effects of the independent variables on dichotomous drug
usage measures, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
for the quantitative drug usage measures [33]. No covariates
had more than 4.2% missing data. For the multi\ariate
192 J. T. HANLON ET AL.
analyses, missing values were replaced with regression-
predicted imputed scores generated using the BMDP AM
procedure [34]. Final models were fitted to estimate the effect
of cognitive status on medication usage controlling for all the
demographic variables and statistically important health
status and access to health care variables. Final models were
derived in stages. In the first stage, health status and access to
health care variables were entered into regression models as a
group of variables independent of each other. In the second
stage, the significant (p < 0.05) health status and access to
health care variables were retained and entered simul-
taneously into regression models that included cognitive
status and the demographic variables. All of the above-
mentioned analyses were conducted using SAS® software
[35].
In the final phase of analyses, because the Duke EPESE
data are based on a complex, stratified survey design, we
retested the significance of our final multivariate regression
models using SUDAAN, a specialized software program
developed for the analysis of complex sampling designs and
which adjusts for the effects of clustering and stratification
[36]. Significance tests reported for the multivariate models
were also adjusted to reflect the number of non-missing cases
prior to imputation.
Results
Table I shows the descriptive characteristics of the
participants by cognitive status. Fifty-two participants
(1.2%) with missing data on cognitive status were
excluded, leaving a sample of 4110 participants of
whom 139 (3.4%) had proxy informants. All but one of
the 139 proxy interviews were for those participants
subsequently determined to be cognitively impaired.
Cognitive impairment, as assessed by the SPMSQ, was
found for 13.7% of the total sample. Assessment of
group differences provided evidence (p < 0.05) that
those who were cognitively impaired were older, less
educated, more functionally impaired, had greater
chronic disease burden, were more likely to have
many health visits, be hospitalized in the past year
and be receiving Medicaid.
The majority of participants reported the use of one
or more prescription drugs. Bivariate analyses revealed
that the use of prescription drugs was similar for both
cognitively impaired and intact participants (74.8 vs.
75.2%, respectively; X
2 = 0.03; df = 1; p = 0.88). Table
II presents the multivariate analyses on the prevalence
of prescription drug use by cognitive status. After
controlling for important covariates, those who were
cognitively impaired were 34% less likely to use
prescription drugs than those who were cognitively
intact. Covariates found to be positively associated
(p < 0.05) with prescription drug use included being
female, an urban resident, having one or more func-
tional limitations, poorer health, one or more health
visits in the previous year and seeing the same physician
at health visits. Bivariate analyses revealed that mean
prescription drug use was greater among those who
were cognitively impaired than among those who
were intact (2.60±0.10 vs. 2.17 ±0.04, respectively;
t = 4.31; df = 1; p < 0.001). Table II also presents the

drugs used by cognitive status. There were no
differences (p > 0.05) between cognitive status groups
in the total number of prescription drugs taken after
controlling for other factors. Covariates found to be
inversely associated with the total number of prescrip-

inversely associated (p < 0.05) with the total number of
non-prescription drugs was being black, whereas being
female, having one or more functional limitations,
poorer health, and one or more health visits in the
previous year were positively associated with the total
number of non-prescription drugs. Bivariate analyses
revealed that those who were cognitively impaired took
a similar mean number of non-prescription medications
to those who were cognitively intact (1.27 ±0.05 vs.
1.32 ±0.02, respectively; f = 0.83; d f = l ; p = 0.23).
Table III also presents the multivariate analyses on the
number of non-prescription drugs used by the cogni-
tive status groups. There were no differences (p > 0.05)
with cognitive status in the total number of non-
prescription drugs taken after controlling for other
factors. Covariates that were positively associated
(p < 0.05) with number of non-prescription drugs
included being female, an urban resident, having one

being black was inversely associated (p < 0.05) with the
total number of non-prescription drugs.
Table IV reports the percentage of people taking

were cognitively impaired were less likely (p < 0.05) to
take analgesics and more likely (p < 0.05) to take
central nervous system and nutritional supplements
than those who were intact. However, after controlling
for other factors, this association did not hold for
nutritional supplements (Adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI
0.95-1.59) but did for analgesics (Adjusted OR = 0.66,
95% CI 0.52-0.83) and central nervous system (CNS)

proportion of people taking a medication in any one of
the analgesic or CNS subclasses by cognitive status.
The most commonly used analgesic subclass was
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
which were less likely (p < 0.05) to be taken by those
who were cognitively impaired than by those who were
intact. Use of other analgesic subclasses was similar
(p > 0.05) for both groups. The most commonly used
CNS subclass was benzodiazepines and their use and
the use of miscellaneous CNS drugs was similar
(p > 0.05) for the two groups. Those who were
cognitively impaired were more likely (p < 0.05) to
take antidepressants, anti-emetics, anticonvulsants,
neuroleptics, other sedative/hypnotics, and antiparkin-
son drugs than those who were cognitively intact.
These CNS subclasses were further collapsed into
either psychotropic (i.e. benzodiazepines, anti-
depressants, neuroleptics, sedative/hypnotics) or non-
psychotropic CNS medications. Bivariate analyses
revealed that those who were cognitively impaired
were more likely than cognitively intact individuals to
take both psychotropic (22% vs. 16%, respectively;
X2 = 12.15; df = 1; p < 0.001) and non-psychotropic
CNS medications (14.6% vs. 6.2%, respectively;
X2 = 51.07; df = 1; p < 0.001).
Discussion
This is one of the first studies to describe drug use
patterns among cognitively impaired community-
dwelling elderly people. We found that after controlling
for potential confounders, cognitively impaired
individuals were less likely to be users of prescription
or over-the-counter medications than those who were
cognitively intact. The lower utilization of prescription
drugs is of potential concern since it may represent
underuse of medications, as those who were cognitively
impaired should have had at least as great a need given
their greater chronic disease burden and poorer
functional status. There are several possible explana-
tions for this finding. It is possible that this group's
greater need was not adequately recognized by their
physicians. Alternatively, this group's greater need may
have been recognized by physicians, but appropriate
therapy was not initiated because doctors were influ-
enced by the knowledge that the patient was cognitively
impaired. Standard medical practice should include,
when feasible, treatment of health conditions that may
improve functional status and quality of life regardless
of cognitive function. The importance of the lower
utilization of non-prescription drugs by the cognitively
impaired is less clear. This finding may be related to
their impaired cognitive and functional status and
corresponding inability to purchase these products.
Moreover, care-givers may not recognize an impaired
elderly person's need for help.
We found that those who were cognitively impaired
were less likely to take analgesic medications, specifi-
cally NSAIDs, than those who were cognitively intact.
This agrees with the study by Kumar et al. for dementia
patients and the findings by Wolf-Klein et al. in a study
that compared patients with normal and impaired
mental status [11, 12]. There are several possible
interpretations of these findings. Participants with
DRUG USE BY COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED ELDERLY PEOPLE 195
cognitive impairment may not be able to express pain
symptoms in an interpretable fashion [37]. Alterna-
tively, the higher use of analgesics by those who were
cognitively intact may represent a protective effect of
certain diseases or the medications used to treat them.
For example, a lower than expected prevalence of
Alzheimer's disease has been reported in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis [38]. Unfortunately, we did not
collect information from participants during the Duke
EPESE first in-home interview about the presence or
absence of arthritis. Moreover, a recent report by
Breitner et al. suggested that there is an inverse
association between Alzheimer's disease and anti-
inflammatory drugs (including NSAIDs) [39]. In
contrast, a large study of an ambulatory elderly
sample from Florida found no association between
NSAID use and cognitive decline [40].
We found that those who were cognitively impaired
were more likely to take CNS medications than those
who were cognitively intact. Overall, 32% of cognitively
impaired participants took one or more CNS medica-
tions, with the most common type being benzodiaze-
pines. Although high, the prevalence of CNS
medication usage was less than the 37-50% rate
reported by Semla et al. for 930 ambulatory patients
with different types of dementia who came to medical
attention [13]. There are several plausible explanations
for our findings. The high use of CNS medications may
reflect the appropriate use of psychotropics to treat
behavioural and psychiatric complications associated
with cognitive impairment due to dementia [21--23].
However, the usage level of benzodiazepines may be of
concern given that comparative clinical trials have
demonstrated greater efficacy with neuroleptics, espe-
cially for psychotic symptoms [21-23]. Alternatively,
the higher use of both CNS psychotropic and non-
psychotropic medications may be causing or exacer-
bating cognitive impairment [16-20]. In one notable
study of 300 patients referred to a tertiary care clinic for
evaluation of cognitive impairment, Larson et al. rated
46 drug therapies as the aetiology for this condition
in 35 patients, with the most common drug class
implicated being benzodiazepines [20].
We believe that these differences in drug use patterns
are not likely to be due to under- or over-reporting by
those who were cognitively impaired for several
reasons. First, special procedures were used to collect
medication data (i.e. interviewers actually seeing and
recording medications and use of proxy informants).
Second, among those who were cognitively impaired,
drug use patterns were similar (data not shown) for
those without and with proxy interviews. Finally, the
total number of medications used was similar for both
cognitive status groups and similar to that reported by
previous studies of elderly people in the community
[5-7].
There are several potential limitations to this study.
It was cross-sectional and causal interpretations are
hampered by lack of knowledge of time-order relation-
ships. Other potential limitations include that lack of
knowledge about the specific causes for participants'
cognitive impairment and cognitive status were based
on a single evaluation with the SPMSQ. However, the
SPMSQ has been shown to have substantial reliability
[30] and good sensitivity and specificity in identifying
community dwelling subjects diagnosed as having
dementia [41]. Fourth, medications were categorized
into broad therapeutic classes, which did not allow for
examination of individual medications for specific
indications. Finally, this is a study of community
dwelling elderly people living in the southeastern US
and may not be representative of other populations
where drug prescribing and non-prescription drug use
habits may be different.
Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that
community dwelling elderly people who are cognitively
impaired are less likely than those who are cognitively
intact to use prescription or non-prescription medica-
tion. Further, the use of analgesics is less likely and
CNS drugs more likely among those who are cogni-
tively impaired. Future research is needed to examine
longitudinal drug-use patterns, and the use of specific
medication classes for specific diseases or conditions by
cognitive status and associated causes, to clarify these
findings.
