Article
An extensive body of research has shown that parent involve-
ment during middle school is associated with a range of posi-
tive academic outcomes including higher class grades and
test scores and other school achievement outcomes (e.g.,
Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994; Gutman & Eccles, 1999; Hill
et al., 2004; Hill & Tyson, 2009; Simons-Morton & Crump,
2003). In light of the benefits of parent involvement, policies
to close the achievement gap have required school systems to
develop comprehensive parent involvement and family­
school partnership strategies (e.g., "No Child Left Behind
Act," 2002). Educators face unique challenges in their efforts
to increase parent involvement as children transition from
elementary to middle school. Compared with elementary
schools, middle schools are both larger with respect to their
physical size and their student body, and parents must inter-
act with an increased number of teachers to stay abreast of
their adolescents' academic progress. These more imper-
sonal school environments may present difficulties to par-
ents as they attempt to develop new relationships and to
understand how to be involved (Hill &Tyson, 2009; Seidman,
Lambert, Allen, & Aber, 2003). Furthermore, young adoles-
cents may discourage particular parent involvement activi-
ties when they perceive the activity as diminishing their
autonomy (Stevenson & Baker, 1987). In addition, this is the
age at which there are changes in both adolescents' and par-
ents' beliefs about the boundaries of parental authority,
which then leads adolescents to engage their parents less and
parents to decrease their engagement with their children
(Daddis, 2011).
The impact of school and developmental transitions on par-
ent involvement is compounded by a multitude of school and
parent factors that serve as barriers to middle school parent
involvement (e.g., Eccles & Harold, 1993; Gonzalez-DeHass
& Willems, 2003; Kim, 2009). African American parents with
low incomes and low educational attainment face consider-
able parent involvement barriers (Halle, Kurtz-Costes, &
Mahoney, 1997; Koonce & Harper, 2005; Trotman, 2001;
Williams & Sanchez, 2013), and may experience these barri-
ers to a greater extent than more advantaged parents or White
parents do (Frew, Zhou, Duran, Kwok, & Benz, 2012; Griffith,
1998). In the current study, we identify barriers to middle
school parent involvement among a sample of predominately
African American parents with low incomes and low levels of
educational attainment whose children attend urban public
middle schools. We also identify facilitators to parent involve-
ment in middle school, factors that have been examined in

Abstract
Using semistructured interviews, we explored barriers and facilitators to school-based parent involvement (SBPI) in a sample
of predominately African American parents (N = 44) whose children attended urban public middle schools. Barriers to SBPI
(e.g., perceptions of hostile parent­teacher interactions and aggressive, disrespectful students in the school) were more
commonly reported than facilitators (e.g., child invitations for involvement). Findings suggest that parents' motivations for
engaging in SBPI may be undermined by a variety of barriers, resulting in low participation. Implications and tailored strategies
for enhancing SBPI in this population are presented.

only a handful of studies on African American parent involve-
ment (e.g., Archer-Banks & Behar-Horenstein, 2008).
What Is Parent Involvement?
Parent involvement represents parents' commitment of
resources and time to the academic sphere of their children's
lives. Epstein (1995) identified six forms of parent involve-
ment: (a) establishing home environments that support learn-
ing, (b) facilitating effective communication between school
and home, (c) helping the school and supporting students, (d)
learning at home, (e) participating in school decision-making
processes, and (f) working with other stakeholders (i.e., stu-
dents, school staff, community) to strengthen the school.
Scholars usually group these parent involvement activities
into two broad categories: home-based parent involvement
and school-based parent involvement (SBPI; Deplanty,
Coulter-Kern, & Duchane, 2007; Deslandes & Bertrand,
2005; Pomerantz, Moorman, & Litwack, 2007). Home-based
parent involvement includes practices related to children's
education that take place outside of the school, usually within
the home. These practices may be directly related to school-
work, including assisting with homework, responding to
children's academic choices, and talking about academic
issues (Eccles & Harold, 1993). SBPI occurs when parents
actually make contact with the school and includes partici-
pating in general school meetings, communicating with
teachers and administrators, attending school events, and
volunteering at the school (Herrold & O'Donnell, 2008).
Researchers have also proposed that parents'positive atti-
tudes about education and their communication of expecta-
tions concerning academic achievement to their children
represent additional components of parent involvement
(Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994; Hill & Tyson, 2009). Hill
and Tyson (2009) identified academic socialization as a form
of parent involvement examined in the literature. Academic
socialization includes parenting practices such as communi-
cation of expectations about educational attainment, cultivat-
ing academic and career aspirations, connecting schoolwork
and current events, and discussing learning techniques with
children (Hill & Tyson, 2009). In their meta-analysis on the
extant research on middle school parent involvement, Hill
and Tyson (2009) found that, although academic socializa-
tion was the strongest predictor of academic success, SBPI
has also been associated with academic achievement and
other measures of doing well in school. However, the bene-
fits of these forms of parent involvement may not be widely
realized in the middle school years. As mentioned previ-
ously, parent involvement declines in middle school (Herrold
& O'Donnell, 2008) compared with elementary school, per-
haps due to diminished opportunities (Dauber & Epstein,
1993; Gonzalez-DeHass & Willems, 2003). The identifica-
tion of barriers and facilitators to parent involvement pres-
ents an opportunity to inform the development of strategies
to increase middle school parental engagement, particularly
among populations at greatest risk for low involvement.
Identifying Barriers and Facilitators to
Parent Involvement
Central to the identification of barriers and facilitators is a
focus on factors that influence parents' decisions to engage
in parent involvement. The Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler
model of the parent involvement process (Hoover-Dempsey,
Bassler, & Brissie, 1997; Hoover-Dempsey & Sandler, 1995;
Walker, Wilkins, Dallaire, Sandler, & Hoover-Dempsey,
2005) describes the specific processes that influence parents'
decisions to engage in parent involvement. This model of
parent involvement process also explicates how they contrib-
ute to the forms of parent involvement implemented and to
child outcomes. The current study focuses on the first two
levels of this model, which describe the processes that influ-
ence parents' decisions to engage in parent involvement and
how parents become involved (i.e., the forms of parent
involvement). Hoover-Dempsey and colleagues posit that
parents' decisions to engage in parent involvement are influ-
enced by three motivational factors: (a) motivational beliefs,
(b) parents' perceptions of invitations to become involved,
and (c) parents'personal life context. We organize the review
of the literature on barriers and facilitators to parent involve-
ment by these three motivational factors.
Evidence suggests that African American parents, espe-
cially those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), may expe-
rience greater barriers to parent involvement than more
advantaged parents or White parents do (e.g., Griffith, 1998).
This highlights the salience of race as a potential factor shap-
ing parent involvement. Thus, the literature review addition-
ally identifies studies regarding how parents' perceptions of
racism may influence motivational factors for parent involve-
ment. This inclusion of studies related to parents' experi-
ences with and perceptions of racism in the schools is in line
with Critical Race Theory (CRT; Delgado & Stefancic,
2001), which has as a central tenet the notion that racism is
endemic to American society. CRT has been used to analyze
aspects of education such as instruction and curriculum
through a lens that recognizes the pervasiveness of racism in
schools and seeks to understand how racism shapes school
policies and practices (Ladson-Billings, 1998).
Motivational Beliefs
Motivational beliefs are first determined by parental role
construction or parents' attitudes and beliefs about their role
as a parent in fostering their child's educational success
(Hoover-Dempsey et al., 1997; Walker et al., 2005). Parental
role construction represents parents' beliefs about what they
should do regarding parent involvement (Hoover-Dempsey
et al., 2005, Walker et al., 2005), and there is evidence that
parental role construction is an important motivational factor
for parents of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds (see
Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005, for a review). Other motiva-
tional factors are thought to translate into the parent's taking
action to become involved. This is particularly true of the
Murray et al. 3
second motivational belief: parents' self-efficacy. This refers
to parents' belief that they are capable of helping their child
achieve in school (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005, Walker et
al., 2005). Parents' self-efficacy for involvement may be a
barrier to parents of low SES. For example, parents of lim-
ited educational backgrounds may lack the confidence to
interact with teachers and navigate the school (Kim, 2009;
Koonce & Harper, 2005). For low-income African American
parents, perceptions of racism as well as their own negative
school experiences may shape their self-efficacy and serve to
distance them from schools (Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007).
Perceptions of Invitations to Become
Involved
Parents' perceptions of invitations to become involved
include specific invitations from the child. Child invitations
for involvement may be both explicit (e.g., child asking par-
ent to help with a fund-raiser) or implicit (e.g., parent
observes that her child is struggling with a class and talks
with the teacher; Walker et al., 2005). Invitations may also
originate from the school through specific teacher invitations
(e.g., teacher invites the parent to volunteer in a classroom)
and general invitations for involvement from the school
(Walker et al., 2005). There is evidence that some teachers
may not invite parent involvement because of their frustra-
tion with low-achieving, low SES students (Eccles & Harold,
1993; Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007) or because they view the
family as the source of their students' achievement problems
(Griffith, 1998; Trotman, 2001). Common misunderstand-
ings include teachers' negative perceptions about the effi-
cacy and capacity of low-income parents and teachers'
beliefs in the effectiveness of parental involvement with this
population (Kim, 2009). Parents are more likely to partici-
pate in school activities when they feel empowered by their
interactions with the school staff (Baker, 1997). However,
power differentials related to educational achievement and
professional expertise may lead to unequal relationships
between parents and school staff, thereby marginalizing low-
income parents instead of empowering them (Barton, Drake,
Perez, St. Louis, & George, 2004; Khan, 1996). Sometimes
African American parents' lack of confidence in their skills
and capacity to interact with teachers (Lareau & Shumar,
1996) and perceptions of racism may further distance them
from the schools even when invitations to the school are
given (Koonce & Harper, 2005).
General invitations for involvement from the school relate
to the general atmosphere or climate of the school (Walker
et al., 2005). Establishing a welcoming school climate and
effectively publicizing school events to parents are examples
of ways schools invite parental involvement (Green, Walker,
Hoover-Dempsey, & Sandler, 2007; Hoover-Dempsey &
Sandler, 1997). For African American parents, a positive
school climate is an important component of general school
invitations for involvement. In a qualitative study of African
American parents, Archer-Banks and Behar-Horenstein
(2008) found that, although parents viewed parent involve-
ment as important, the school environment (particularly
school personnel's expectations, practices, and policies)
influenced their level of involvement. In addition, research
suggests a responsive middle school environment could
eliminate barriers existing between middle schools and
African American parents (e.g., teacher's low expectations
for children's academic potential and parental involvement;
Archer-Banks and Behar-Horenstein, 2008; Overstreet,
Devine, Bevans, & Efreom, 2005).
School violence is one dimension of school climate that
has particular relevance to parents whose children attend
public schools in urban communities. Urban schools have
been shown to have higher levels of violent incidents in
schools compared with suburban and rural schools (Neiman,
2011; Weishew & Peng, 1993). Although the links between
school violence and parent involvement have not been
widely examined, existing evidence suggests that school
safety is associated with greater levels of parent involvement
(Griffith, 1998; Kandakai, Price, Telljohann, & Wilson,
1999). School violence as a factor influencing parent involve-
ment has broad implications because school violence is a
national problem (Schonfeld, 2006). According to the most
recent published findings of the national School Survey on
Crime and Safety, approximately 73% of schools reported at
least one violent incident at the school during the 2009-2010
school year (Neiman, 2011). Moreover, both the percentage
of schools reporting student bullying daily or at least once a
week and the rate of violent incidents was higher for middle
schools than for elementary and high schools (Neiman,
2011). Examining the extent to which school violence, con-
ceptualized as a specific component of the school climate,
hinders or fosters parent involvement will add to the knowl-
edge base regarding the role of school invitations in motivat-
ing parent involvement.
Personal Life Context
Personal life context refers to parents' skills and knowledge
and the perceived time and energy parents can expend to
become involved (Walker et al., 2005). Research suggests
that the personal life context of low SES parents may present
a plethora of barriers to parent involvement. For example,
parents with low educational attainment may lack the requi-
site sets of skills and knowledge to assist their children with
assignments especially beyond the elementary school grades
(Trotman, 2001). Work often serves as a barrier for low-
income parents to devote time to attend school meetings,
volunteer at the school, or participate in other parent involve-
ment activities (Mannan & Blackwell, 1992; Van Velsor &
Orozco, 2007). Although work affects the ability of parents
to participate in SBPI activities regardless of income group,
work barriers differentially affect low-income parents. Low-
income parents are more likely to have inflexible work
4 SAGE Open
schedules, multiple jobs, and/or positions without paid leave
benefits (Mannan & Blackwell, 1992; Van Velsor & Orozco,
2007).
Limited resources, such as lack of transportation, have
also been shown to hinder SBPI (Reglin, King, Losike-
Sedimo, & Ketterer, 2003; Williams & Sanchez, 2013).
Limited resources, moreover, hinder low-income parents'
ability to address the basic needs of children and other rela-
tives with special needs (e.g., old parents) contributing to
further time constraints that negatively affect low-income
parents' involvement (Baker, 1997). In addition to financial
and time constraint barriers, low-income parents may also
experience psychological barriers. For example, low-income
parents who struggle to provide for their families' basic
needs may experience negative mental health effects includ-
ing depression, which may limit parents' capacity to engage
in school activities (Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007).
The Present Study
The purpose of this study was to explore barriers and facilita-
tors to SBPI in a sample of predominately African American
parents living in low-income urban communities whose chil-
dren attend public middle schools. One of the goals of this
qualitative study was to understand parental school engage-
ment in an effort to inform parent­school collaboration
efforts. We used the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of
parent involvement processes as an organizing framework to
understand how barriers inhibit and facilitators foster par-
ents' motivation for involvement. In previous studies,
researchers have largely relied on teachers and administra-
tors to identify barriers and solutions to improving educa-
tional outcomes through enhanced parent involvement
(Barton et al., 2004; Koonce & Harper, 2005) and only a
handful of studies have examined the viewpoint of parents
(e.g., Williams & Sanchez, 2013). This study contributes to
the literature by examining the perspectives of parents and
other caregivers who are predominately African American
and reside in urban, low-income communities.
Method
Participants
Between October 2005 and July 2006, we conducted semis-
tructured interviews with parents who previously consented
to participate in the Steppin'Up study (2004-2007), an inves-
tigation testing the impact of a violence prevention curricu-
lum on early adolescent aggressive behaviors at three public
middle schools in Baltimore City. In the academic school
year prior to this study, two of the three participating schools
were on probation for the federal designation of "persistently
dangerous," a label based on the numbers of student expul-
sions and suspensions for violent offenses (Maryland State
Department of Education, 2007b). These two schools are
also located in communities characterized by poor indicators
of child health and safety including substantial numbers of
juvenile arrests (Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators
Alliance, 2014).All three schools served significant numbers
of low-income students; between 75% and 89% of students
qualified for free or reduced-cost school lunch during the
2005-2006 school year (Maryland State Department of
Education, 2006). Although data regarding the race/ethnicity
of personnel at each school are unavailable, system-level
data indicate that 59.7% of Baltimore City Public School
teachers were African American, 35.6% were White, and
4.7% were categorized as other during the 2005-2006 school
year (Maryland State Department of Education, 2007a).
The original child eligibility criteria included (a) first-
time sixth grader and (b) not in self-contained special educa-
tion classes. The children of participants in the qualitative
study were either in the seventh grade (enrolled in the prior
year) or sixth grade (enrolled in the current year) and were
still participating in the Steppin'Up study's follow-up assess-
ments. Of the 857 parents eligible, 513 parents (60% partici-
pation rate) consented to participate in the larger Steppin'Up
study at the time of the qualitative study. The Institutional
Review Boards of the Johns Hopkins University and the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) and the city school district review board approved
this study.
Recruitment for the qualitative study was targeted to par-
ents of seventh graders at one school (first cohort) and par-
ents of sixth graders at all three schools (second cohort; N =
381). Using a randomized contact list, staff contacted parents
through a combination of telephone calls and letters. Blocks
of 10 parents at a time were contacted until the recruitment
goal was met. When staff documented 10 consecutive unan-
swered phone calls, a visit was made to the parent's home. If
no one answered the door, a postcard was left with instruc-
tions on how to contact staff. Parents had to be English
speaking to participate. Fifty-one parents were reached and
asked to participate. A total of 44 parents agreed to partici-
pate (30 mothers, 5 fathers, and 9 other caregivers, including
grandmothers and aunts). Although the contact list was ran-
domized, the 44 participants represent individuals who self-
selected to participate. A little more than one half were
parents of sixth graders (n = 23), and the remaining
were parents of seventh graders (n = 21). On average, parents
were 41 years of age. The sample was predominately African
American (n = 39), followed by White (n = 2), Latino (n = 1),
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (n = 1), and Other (n = 1).
Most participants (63%) had a high school diploma/GED or
less, and 50% reported incomes of less than US$15,000 per
year.
Data Collection
Three interviewers were researchers with prior experience
conducting semistructured interviews, and the fourth inter-
viewer was a postbaccalaureate research intern with some
Murray et al. 5
prior research experience. Prior to fielding, the two most
experienced interviewers led a 2-hr training on the protocol
and interview techniques. Researchers alternated roles as
interviewer and notetaker, with the two most experienced
researchers conducting the initial interviews to facilitate
training. Continued supervision and weekly meetings
between interviewers and senior staff ensured interview pro-
tocol adherence.
Researchers developed a semistructured interview guide
to examine aims associated with the larger adolescent aggres-
sion study and, to a lesser extent, secondary aims associated
with the current parent involvement study. Using this inter-
view guide, researchers asked parents to discuss their views
about violence, what they communicate to their children
about violence and fighting, and what parents, schools, and
communities can do to keep their children safe. Parents were
also asked a series of questions about their current involve-
ment in their child's education and school. The interview
guides were pilot tested with three parents recruited to the
Steppin'Up study. All interviews were digitally recorded and
the notetaker wrote down participant responses, capturing
impressions from body language as well as providing a
backup data collection measure. The interviewer and
notetaker met following the interview to debrief and com-
plete a field interview observation form. Although the major-
ity of interviews were held in parents'homes, a small number
of parents requested their interview take place at a commu-
nity location (i.e., a private room at the child's school). The
interviews lasted about 1 hr and parents were provided finan-
cial remuneration for their time.
Data Analysis
We compared the transcribed and recorded interviews for
accuracy and completeness. Parent interview transcript files
were uploaded into hyperRESEARCH 2.7
(HyperRESEARCH, 2009). We used a grounded theory
approach for data coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). These
data were coded by looking for themes that emerged from
participants' statements. A team of three researchers identi-
fied themes using the first 12 transcribed parent interviews.
First, an experienced primary coder (D.H.) with expertise in
qualitative research methodology open coded and consulted
with two experienced qualitative coders Vanya Jones (V.J.)
and Nikeea Copeland-Linder (N.C.). A coding manual was
developed based on the initial 12 interviews and modified as
subsequent interviews were coded. Each new idea generated
a code; similar codes were grouped by themes. The experi-
enced primary coder Denise L. Haynie (D.H.) trained three
postbaccalaureate research interns and a doctoral student
[Kimberly Chambers (K.C.), Amanda McEnery (A.M.),
Elizabeth Noelcke (E.N.), Kantahyanee Murray (K.M.)], and
all five individuals coded the transcripts. We utilized a dou-
ble coding approach for each transcript to improve reliabil-
ity. Two coders were responsible for coding a transcript and
then meeting to compare every instance of coded text. The
two coders achieved consensus on all instances of coding
discrepancies by discussing the merits of the codes selected.
When coders could not agree on the appropriate code for a
particular text, these instances of text were noted and dis-
cussed in coding progress meetings led by the experienced
primary coder (D.H.) who resolved all coding disagreements.
Codes relevant to parent involvement in the child's educa-
tion were examined in the current study. The overarching
themes represented by these codes are shown in Table 1. The
Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of parent involvement
processes was applied to the themes as an organizing
framework.
Results
Themes related to the three motivational factors for parent
involvement proposed in the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler
model of parent involvement processes are described in the
following sections. The three motivational factors are
(a) parents' motivational beliefs, (b) parents' perceptions of
invitations for involvement from others, and (c) parents' per-
ceived life context. First, we provide a description of the
themes related to parents' motivational beliefs. Next, we
organize the remaining themes that describe parents' percep-
tions of invitations for involvement from others and parents'
perceived life context under two sections: facilitators and
barriers. Some themes included both facilitators and barriers.
We organized these themes in the barriers section because
the findings were predominately those that described imped-
iments to engagement in SBPI.
Parents' Motivational Beliefs
Parental role construction.Nearly all parents indicated that
being involved in their child's school was an important role
that parents should play in their child's education. The fol-
lowing parent's statement exemplifies this attitude:
[Parents] certainly play the most important role [in their
children's education], I think. And, we should always be active
in everything that's going on with them more than just checking
homework and just making sure that the homework is done.
(Mother, age 48)
Volunteering (e.g., aiding teachers in the classroom and
chaperoning field trips) and attending PTAand similar school
meetings were frequently mentioned as SBPI activities that
parents should be a part of at their child's school. However,
the majority of parents reported low levels of actual engage-
ment in volunteering and attending school meetings. One
mother explained, "Every so often I've been to a PTA meet-
ing or two. And I've spoken to my child's teacher once or
twice. But not as often as I think it should be, as often as I
would like to be" (Mother, age 48).
6 SAGE Open
Nearly three quarters of parents discussed the importance
of supervising their child's academic progress and social
behavior. For some parents, this belief translated into SBPI
practices. For example, one third of parents reported going to
the school to check up on their child. This involved observ-
ing their child in the classroom or other locations in the
school (e.g., lunchroom or cafeteria).
I'll go up to the school to check his progress. I will peek in on
him, even if I don't let him see me. I will always talk to the
teachers, but I just peek my head in to make sure he's sitting
down at his desk. (Mother, age 30)
In addition to motivational beliefs, parental involvement
practices are also influenced by child invitations for involve-
ment, teacher invitations for involvement, general school
invitations for involvement, and parents' perceived life con-
text. In the next two sections, we describe the facilitators and
barriers related to these components of the parent involve-
ment process model.
Facilitators
Child invitations for involvement. Child invitations for involve-
ment are one way that parents perceive they are invited to
become involved. In this sample, explicit and implicit child
invitations for involvement contributed to parent engage-
ment in SBPI. For example, three parents mentioned visiting
the school to follow-up on their child's claim that a teacher
was treating them inappropriately (e.g., unfair punishment or
harsh reprimands).
If he saying he's having trouble with a teacher, I want to see for
myself, how does that teacher come across to me when I'm
talking to him or her. So that would be one reason I would go up
[to the school]. (Grandmother, age 61)
Five parents indicated implicit child invitations for
involvement that involved initiating communication with
teachers to address problems related to their child's academic
progress or behavioral problems. One grandmother described
talking with teachers about her child's conflict with another
student at the school:
I went down to [the school], but they weren't for pleasant
reasons. I went down there because I tried to avoid--you know,
I could see an incident blowing up, blowing up with [my
daughter] and the girls down there. I went down there to talk to
the teacher about it. (Grandmother, age 66)
Teacher-specific invitations for involvement and general
school invitations for involvement are the other ways parents
perceive they are invited to become involved. In this sample,
the themes that emerged for these two components of the
parent involvement process model represented barriers to
parent involvement.
Barriers
Teacher-specific invitations for involvement.Teacher invita-
tions for involvement were infrequently mentioned. When
teacher invitations for involvement were extended, they
were generally to address the child's disruptive behavior
problems. One parent described her perception that teacher
invitations for involvement were both rare and behavior-
problem focused:
You've got to talk to these teachers. Just be involved. Because a
lot of the times, teachers don't even--if your child does not have
a behavior problem, but they could still be in the class not doing
what they're supposed to do, you won't get a phone call. The
only time they give you phone calls is if it's a behavior problem
that's affecting them. (Mother, age 26)

Murray et al. 7
This quote illustrates some parents' perceptions that
teachers do not invite parents to become involved when their
child has difficulties not related to problem behavior in the
classroom. This absence of teacher invitations to become
involved impedes SBPI; that is, teachers'failure to make par-
ents aware of particular problems with their children limits
parents' opportunities for SBPI.
Ten parents reported teacher invitations to come to the
school because their child was involved in a conflict (typi-
cally a fight) with another child or exhibited behavior prob-
lems in class. In these cases, parents were visiting the school
to participate in parent­teacher conferences that were often
mandatory.
Approximately one half of parents indicated having nega-
tive impressions of teachers in the school and generally dis-
cussed unfriendly and hostile interactions with teachers.
Some of these parents reported instances when teachers were
disrespectful to or inappropriately communicated with their
children.
General school invitations for involvement.Most parents indi-
cated that their children's school offered opportunities for
SBPI. However, parents indicated that opportunities for
involvement were not communicated in a timely, organized
fashion. For example, some parents reported not learning
about opportunities including school assemblies and meet-
ings until it was too late for them to rearrange their schedule
or until after they had occurred. One mother said,
Communication is lackadaisical and next to none. When she's in
trouble, they're quick to pick up the phone, but I don't hear
nothing about PTA meetings . . . [T]hey're going on a field trip
and they sent the permission slip home like two, maybe three
days before the trip. I've seen a few pieces of paper from time to
time, but again, anything regular or anything that I can like put
my hands on and make a calendar from, it doesn't happen.
(Mother, age 33)
Although two parents indicated that their child failed to
give them flyers and other materials publicizing activities,
the majority of parents attributed poor communication to
inadequate organization and communication channels at
their child's school. Other less commonly discussed SBPI
issues included parents'perception that the school offered no
SBPI opportunities, offered them at inconvenient times, such
as during the workday, and an impression that the PTA was
ineffective.
Nearly all parents mentioned having a negative impres-
sion of one or more aspects of the school climate at their
child's school. More than one third of parents mentioned
having an overall negative impression of the school, includ-
ing their perceptions of the school's discipline and safety
problems and criticisms of the administration's inability to
effectively address school challenges. Furthermore, 16 par-
ents expressed negative impressions of students in their
child's school. These parents generally discussed the high
levels of aggressive and disrespectful student behavior in the
schools. One father stated,
The teachers and administration had no control at all. It was
almost like a three-ring circus, kids cussing, threatening,
fighting, running, throwing stuff; you name it, knocking people
out of the way. No respect. (Father, age 53)
Parents' displeasure with aggressive and disrespectful
students was reported as an obstacle to engaging in SBPI.
One parent said, "I don't want to go [to the school] because
sometimes you can't deal with other people's children . . .
They [are] disrespectful and they get smart with you in a
minute" (Mother, age 32). Furthermore, other parents in the
child's school were described in a negative light. One mother
described how she perceived other parents as antagonistic
and difficult to engage when resolving child behavior-related
problems:
When you do have little problems with children at the school
and you try to go to this parent, you don't want to go--they get
mad when you approach their child when [they are] not around.
But then [these parents are] nowhere to be found when I need to
talk . . . about my child's problem. (Mother, age 26)
Ten parents reported wanting little or no contact with
other parents, an attitude that impedes engagement in
SBPI. Parents' desire to avoid potentially negative interac-
tions was the most common reason parent-to-parent con-
tact was not wanted. Although parents generally reported
not knowing other parents, one half were interested in
meeting other parents. Parents' reasons for wanting to get
to know the parents of their children's friends included
having a way to keep track of their child's whereabouts
and activities when unsupervised and building relation-
ships to facilitate communication about issues relevant to
their child's schooling.
Parents' Perceived Life Context
Time and energy. Work and scheduling issues were the most
frequently reported barriers to SBPI. One common response
by parents was that they had no time to participate in SBPI
consistently or at all because of their demanding work sched-
ules and the absence of paid leave benefits. Therefore, they
were unable to or could not afford to take time off to partici-
pate in school activities. Often the combination of work
issues and family responsibilities synergistically created
more obstacles to SBPI. One parent explained,
I mean, basically [parents] just don't have time, unless they go
[to the school] like early in the morning or whatever . . . I really
don't have time because when I get off work or go to my other
job, or have to come home, clean up. Like right now, I'm
washing, and I have to cook dinner. I really don't have time. But
I would like to, I really would, but I'm not rich. (Mother, age 45)
8 SAGE Open
Despite such multifaceted work and scheduling chal-
lenges, a small number of parents described strategies or sac-
rifices made to overcome these SBPI barriers. One mother
said,
So yes, I do have to forgo some sleep sometimes. You know,
when I was working during the day, there were days when I
would let my boss know the day before. "Look, I'm going to be
late coming in because I have to go and visit my child's school."
(Mother, age not disclosed)
Skills and knowledge.There were no study findings directly
related to parents' skills and knowledge (or attitudes regard-
ing their skills and knowledge) as it pertains to engagement
in SBPI. Rather, the findings related to parents' skills and
knowledge were directly relevant to home-based parent
involvement (e.g., attitudes that endorsed providing aca-
demic assistance, linking their children to trusted family
members and trusted adults in the community who could
provide academic help).
Discussion
Guided by the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler model of par-
ent involvement processes (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 1997;
Walker et al., 2005), we identified barriers and facilitators to
SBPI among parents who lived in low-income urban com-
munities and whose children attended three public middle
schools. Our findings support previous research demonstrat-
ing links between motivational factors (i.e., motivational
beliefs, invitations for involvement, and personal life con-
text) and the frequency and types of parent involvement
implemented (Deslandes & Bertrand, 2005; Green et al.,
2007; Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005). In the current study,
motivational beliefs for parent involvement were expressed
in the form of parents' positive role construction regarding
their function to support their child's educational endeavors.
However, the quality of invitations for involvement by teach-
ers and the school as well as parents' personal life context
presented a number of barriers. One important contribution
of this study is the finding that students' aggressive behavior
in the school not only contributed to some parents' negative
perceptions of the school climate but in fact it also hindered
their engagement in SBPI. Overall, the barriers identified
help to explain why parents in the current study indicated
infrequent involvement in SBPI activities.
Motivational Beliefs
Parents overwhelmingly reported positive attitudes and
beliefs regarding their role in fostering their child's educa-
tional success. Consistent with previous research examining
parental role construction (Baker, 1997; Drummond &
Stipek, 2004; Sheldon, 2002), the parents in the current study
expressed that they have a role in their child's education and
were interested in being involved in their child's education at
home and at school. In the current study, parents'perceptions
of their self-efficacy, the second component of motivational
beliefs, were not reported. Some research suggests that par-
ents' self-efficacy may be low among parents with limited
educational attainment (Kim, 2009; Koonce & Harper,
2005). However, in a sample of parents of diverse ethnic and
SES backgrounds, Green et al. (2007) found a negative asso-
ciation between self-efficacy and SBPI. This finding sug-
gests that parents who are less confident about their capacity
to help their child in school may interact with the school
more often to obtain support (Green et al., 2007). Additional
research in this area may help to elucidate the relationship
between self-efficacy and SBPI specifically among popula-
tions more similar to the sample in the current study.
Parents' Invitations for Involvement
Parents reported invitations for SBPI from their children and
their teachers. Invitations from children were facilitators to
SBPI in that they involved parental initiation of contact with
teachers and other school staff, often to address problems
including their child's difficulties with schoolwork or behav-
ior. Most parents indicated that their initiation of contact
with teachers was less common than teacher's invitations for
SBPI involvement. Yet, parents indicated that teacher's invi-
tations for SBPI involvement were often mandatory parent­
teacher conferences. Regardless of the source of invitation
for involvement, parents generally reported negative and
sometimes hostile interactions with teachers and other school
staff that can present barriers to future parent involvement
that is up to their discretion. This finding is similar to previ-
ous research indicating that unfriendly and hostile relation-
ships frequently characterize parent and school personnel
interactions in predominately low-income, minority samples
(Barton et al., 2004; Koonce & Harper, 2005).
Moreover, some parents in this sample noted instances
when teachers were inappropriate or disrespectful to their
children. Despite these negative experiences, parents
expressed little reticence about interacting with teachers and
staff. This finding contrasts that of previous studies that iden-
tify barriers such as parents' lack of confidence when inter-
acting with teachers and staff and perceived racism as
hindrances to parent involvement (Kim, 2009; Koonce &
Harper, 2005; Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007). Because per-
ceived racism based on SES or race was not explicitly
explored in the current study, the absence of barriers related
to these factors is uncertain. The exploration of African
American parents' experiences with racism in their interac-
tions with school personnel merits additional research.
Qualitative research that allows African American parents to
tell their stories about racism they have experienced in their
children's school reflects another central tenet of CRT (i.e.,
counterstorytelling; Delgado & Stefancic, 2001) and prom-
ises to yield rich data for critical analysis through a CRT lens.
Present study findings indicate that many parents held
negative impressions of the school. Parents reported that
Murray et al. 9
general school invitations for SBPI about school events and
meetings were poorly coordinated. Information about SBPI
opportunities were communicated inconsistently or too late
for parents to plan appropriately. This poor communication
of SBPI opportunities may worsen parents' perceptions of
the school climate. Aggressive and disrespectful students
dissuaded some parents from visiting the school, and interac-
tions with other parents were viewed unfavorably. One find-
ing of the study suggests that the school climates of the three
middle schools in this study were not welcoming. Given that
a welcoming school climate is an indicator of general school
invitations for parent involvement (Green et al., 2007;
Griffith, 1998; Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005), an unfriendly
school climate may have diminished parents' perceptions of
general invitations for parent involvement from the schools.
Study findings suggest the centrality of student behavior in
parents' perceptions of the qualities of the school environ-
ment. In particular, the perceived school safety risks that
stemmed from aggressive and disrespectful students seemed
to repel some parents in the current study from visiting the
school rather than encourage more frequent visits. This inter-
pretation is in line with prior research indicating a positive
association between school safety and parent involvement
(Griffith, 1998).
It is also noteworthy that the current study described par-
ents' lack of contact with other parents at the school. This
finding is consistent with research indicating that the social
networks of low-income parents do not prominently include
other parents at their children's schools (Lareau & Shumar,
1996). This lack of social connection limits parents'ability to
learn information about the school or their children's educa-
tional process and may play a role in parents' decisions to
engage in SBPI (Lareau & Shumar, 1996; Sheldon, 2002).
On the whole, the parent invitations for involvement find-
ings demonstrate that the parents in this study generally had
negative experiences with the schools. It is interesting to
note that parents' negative experiences with the school both
fueled and thwarted SBPI. For example, the prospect of hav-
ing hostile interactions with teachers reduced the appeal of
SBPI for many parents; however, a child experiencing
teacher disrespect and antagonism was a catalyst for SBPI.
Similarly, the negative school climate repelled parents, yet at
the same time, the deleterious school climate contributed to
the ubiquitous nature of classroom conduct problems and
peer conflicts. Thus, engaging in SBPI to address such prob-
lems was a common experience for a number of parents in
the study. Such parent invitations for involvement findings
exemplify the transactional nature of the interactions between
parents, their children, teachers, administrators, as well as
other students and their parents.
Personal Life Context
Work and scheduling issues were the most commonly identi-
fied barriers. Parents indicated various scheduling issues that
presented a challenge to school involvement including work,
raising children, and family responsibilities (e.g., preparing
dinner, picking up more than one child from school). These
barriers are consistent with previous research on SBPI indi-
cating that inflexible work schedules, multiple jobs, and the
absence of leave benefits are tremendous obstacles to paren-
tal involvement for parents in single-headed households or
of lower SES (Archer-Banks & Behar-Horenstein, 2008;
Lareau & Shumar, 1996; Van Velsor & Orozco, 2007).
Parents also conveyed how demanding work schedules and
multifaceted family responsibilities diminish their physical
energy, thus, inhibiting their ability to engage in SBPI. Some
parents reported having the flexibility to rearrange work
schedules for school events; however, they reported that their
child's school's untimely communication of events pre-
vented them from having enough time to rearrange their
work schedules. Unlike previous research (Lareau & Shumar,
1996; Reglin et al., 2003), limited resources (e.g., lack of
transportation) were mentioned infrequently as barriers to
SBPI. The availability of resources such as transportation
and child care was not probed in this qualitative study.
Therefore, it is unclear why limited resources failed to
emerge as a frequent barrier among parents in the current
study.
Another element reported was that parents'perceptions of
their skills and knowledge in the context of SBPI were not
reported. In a study of parents from diverse ethnic and SES
backgrounds, skills, and knowledge were unrelated to SBPI
(Green et al., 2007). However, other findings from the same
study suggest that parents with low self-efficacy regarding
their capacity to help their child in school may engage in
SBPI more often to obtain support (Green et al., 2007). As
mentioned above, parents'self-efficacy for involvement may
be a barrier to parents of low SES (Hoover-Dempsey et al.,
2005, Walker et al., 2005). Parents' confidence in engaging
with the school may be influenced by their educational
attainment (Kim, 2009; Koonce & Harper, 2005) and other
indicators of knowledge and skills. Additional research on
the role of self-efficacy in predicting SBPI should also incor-
porate measures of knowledge and skills as well as analyses
that explore both direct and indirect relationships among
these factors.
Policy Implications
For schools, building strong parent­school partnerships
requires practical steps that aim to enhance general school
invitations and teacher invitations for involvement. Schools
can also tailor SBPI activities to address the barriers experi-
enced as a result of parents'personal life context. For example,
schools can help increase SBPI by implementing more reliable
and timely methods of communication (e.g., utilization of
social media or texting), scheduling school meetings and
events at varied or multiple times, and soliciting parents'ideas
on other ways to overcome work- and scheduling-related
10 SAGE Open
barriers. In addition, school counselors, social workers, and
other human service professionals can play a pivotal role in
fostering positive parent­teacher relationships. On one
hand, these professionals can educate teachers and other
school staff about the positive role construction and other
assets (i.e., problem-solving skills and access to resources in
parents' social networks) parents can bring to collaborative
processes. On the other hand, these professionals can
encourage parent visits by greeting and orienting them to
SBPI opportunities, thus, boosting the positive aspects of
the school climate. Given parents' concern about aggressive
students in the schools, offering opportunities to inform
school safety promotion programs and policies may be a
good approach to engaging parents in school improvement
efforts. Finally, the parent concerns expressed about nega-
tive interactions with other parents and students highlights
the need for activities that promote community building,
shared goals, and positive interactions with the schools.
Limitations
It is important to note that major school system policy
changes since the study period have resulted in the imple-
mentation of new parent engagement initiatives at the local
and state levels. Thus, compared with parents in the present
study, current parents of students attending these middle
schools may have a different impression of parent involve-
ment barriers and facilitators. Study findings should be con-
sidered in light of several other limitations. First, only the
perspectives of parents and other caregivers were examined.
The perspectives of teachers and other school personnel in
addition to parents may provide a more comprehensive
understanding of issues and solutions. Second, the absence
of specific interview questions regarding race as a potential
barrier to parent involvement may mean that important race-
based dynamics were not identified and explored. It is also
unlikely that the attitudes and practices reported by the cur-
rent study participants fully represent those of the parents
who participated in the larger intervention study as well as
the larger pool of parents whose children attended the three
middle schools. Because our recruitment strategy primarily
involved contacting parents by telephone, parents with dis-
connected or inconsistent telephone service were underrep-
resented in the study. This may have biased the sample
toward including parents with relatively higher incomes and
more resources. Although attempts were made to contact
parents during both day and evening hours, parents who
worked more than one job or with higher family manage-
ment demands may have been more difficult to reach.
Parents whom staff were unable to reach or who refused to
participate may have been those experiencing more exten-
sive barriers to SBPI. Findings should be interpreted with
caution given the limited generalizability of the study
findings.
Conclusion
More barriers than facilitators emerged in this exploration of
factors that inhibit or foster parents'motivation for SBPI in a
sample of predominately African American parents who
have low incomes and whose children attend urban, public
middle schools. The negative quality of parents' interactions
with teachers, the schools, other children and parents, as well
as work and scheduling challenges were factors that hindered
SBPI. In spite of this, the positive motivational beliefs par-
ents expressed, parents' responses to child invitations for
involvement, and the interest of some parents to get to know
other parents are foundations to build on for the development
of stronger, parent­school partnerships characterized by col-
laboration and shared power (Powell & Batsche, 1997).
Future research directions should include further examina-
tions of the role of school climate (including factors related
to students and other parents in the schools) in motivating
parent involvement among African American parents of chil-
dren attending middle schools with school safety risks. In
predominately African American samples, an emphasis on
understanding the role of racism in shaping policies that con-
tribute to unsafe school climates may particularly help to
inform initiatives to improve the school environment.
