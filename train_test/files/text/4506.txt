Abstract. Uniform backgrounds appear lighter or darker when elements containing luminance
gradients move across them, a phenomenon first presented by Ko Nakamura at the 2010 Illusion
Contest in Japan. We measured the apparent lightness of the background with a configuration where
the grey background was overlaid with moving square patches of vertically oriented luminance
gradient. For black-to-grey gradients, the background appeared lighter when the black edges were
leading than when they were trailing. For white-to-grey gradients, the background appeared darker
when the white edges were leading than when they were trailing. For white-to-black gradients, the
background appeared darker with a white edge leading and lighter with a dark edge leading, but
the effects were weaker. These results demonstrate that lightness contrast can be modulated by the
direction of motion of the inducing patterns. The smooth gradient is essential, because the effect
disappeared when the black-to-white gradient was replaced with the binary black and white pattern.
We speculate that asymmetry in the processing of a temporal gradient with increasing and decreasing
contrast, as proposed to explain the "Rotating Snakes" illusion (Murakami, Kitaoka, & Ashida, 2006,
Vision Research, 46, 2421­2431), might be the basis for this effect.
Keywords: visual illusion, lightness, motion, gradient.
1 Introduction
Perception of lightness has been extensively studied in vision science (e.g. Gilchrist, 2006; Kingdom,
2011), but the stimuli used are mostly static and the interaction between lightness and motion has been
relatively neglected. In 2010 an illusion created by Ko Nakamura won the second prize in the 2010
visual illusion contest in Japan (http://visiome.neuroinf.jp/modules/xoonips/detail.php?
item_id=6716). With his permission, we introduce this phenomenon to the wider vision science com-
munity. In the illusion, arrays of oval patches of horizontal luminance gradient are placed on a white
background (see Figure 1). When the patches in the top and the bottom halves of the display move in
opposite directions, the background lightnesses appear to be different: lighter when the black parts are
leading, and darker when the black parts are trailing. This is a striking demonstration that motion can
directly affect lightness perception, but the underlying cause is yet to be investigated.
Questions arise as to how this illusion occurs: is the effect polarity specific; does the effect involve
lightening of an area, darkening of the other area, or both; is the crucial effect enhanced lightness con-
trast at the leading edges, enhanced lightness assimilation at the trailing edges, or both; and how is the
lightness gradient itself crucial, apart from the asymmetry? We addressed these questions by measur-
ing the perceived background lightness in two experiments.
Note that lightness and brightness are not obviously separable in the case of this particular illusion. We
use the term lightness throughout the paper for convenience, because we tend to perceive the background as a
white surface, and also because we asked the participants to judge the colour instead of the intensity of light.
We do not, however, intend to restrict ideas either to phenomenology or underlying mechanisms at this stage.

Methods
2.1.1
Participants
Six participants (including the author HA) were tested in Kyoto University, and four (including the
author NSS) were tested in the University of Bristol under similar conditions. The naïve participants

were paid for their time according to the universities'standards. One participant in Bristol was omitted
from analysis due to a failure to see any illusion in the original artwork (but note that including the data
from this participant did not substantially change the pattern of averaged results).
2.1.2
Stimuli
Visual stimuli were created using PsychToolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) on an Apple MacBook
Pro in Kyoto and a MacBook in Bristol, and presented on CRT displays (EIZO F57 in Kyoto and Sony
Trinitron in Bristol) placed in dim rooms. The screen had a resolution of 1,024 × 768 pixels with a
refresh rate of 100 Hz. The maximum luminance was 110 cd/m2 in Kyoto and 130 cd/m2 in Bristol.
The viewing distance was 420 mm in Kyoto and 590 mm in Bristol.
Simplified versions of the original illusion were used (Figure 2). Grey rectangular fields (H 10 ×
V 6 deg) of mean luminance were presented above and below the centre of the minimum luminance
display, separated by 1.2 deg. In the top rectangular area, square patches (0.6 × 0.6 deg) with verti-
cally oriented luminance gradients were located in grids (3 rows and 10 columns), which moved hori-
zontally at one of the four speeds (0.0, 1.48, 2.97, or 5.93 deg/s) either to the left or right. The lower
rectangle was uniform and its luminance was controlled by the participants via the numerical keypad.
We did not present the gradient patches in the comparison stimulus because changing its lightness
introduces undesirable artefacts of edges at the smooth side of patches. A white fixation bar (H 7.9 ×
V 0.3 deg) was shown in the centre of the display.
There were three types of luminance gradient: white to grey (W-G), black to grey (B-G), and
white to black (W-B), where white denotes maximum luminance and black minimum luminance.
Figure 1. Illustrations of the illusion created by Ko Nakamura. The background is uniformly white, but the top
and bottom parts appear lighter or darker depending on the motion direction, as illustrated by the colouring here.

The gradient was always linear. There were two directions of gradient, and all the patches had the same
gradient in each trial.
2.1.3
Procedure
Participants started each trial by pressing a key. They were instructed to adjust the lightness (grey
level) of the bottom, uniform rectangle to match the apparent colour (whiteness or lightness) of the
background of the upper rectangle by pressing keys. The initial grey level of the bottom rectangle was
randomly set as ±32 (on a 0 to 255 scale) from the veridical value for each trial.
Participants were instructed to keep their fixation within the white bar in the centre. Control of
fixation was not too strict because while direct inspection of each grey area was best avoided, restrict-
ing the comparison of lightness to the small areas around a strongly localised fixation point was also
considered undesirable. There was no time limit for responding.
Each of the 48 conditions (three types of gradients, four speeds, two gradient directions, and two
motion directions) was tested once in a single run in a random order.Arun typically took about 5 to 10 min.
Five runs were conducted for each participant, and the first run was discarded from analysis as a practice.
2.2
Results
For each trial, the difference in the matched luminance of the top and bottom panels was divided
by the mean background luminance of the top panel to give the score of matching error in contrast.
Positive and negative scores indicate that the top panel was perceived lighter and darker, respec-
tively, than it actually was. Participants showed individual biases in their matching: on average,
some adjusted the bottom part too light, others too dark, irrespective of the gradient elements in the
upper part. Each participant's results were therefore normalised by subtracting their baseline before
averaging across participants. The baseline was defined as the averaged matching luminance for the
W-B stimuli at speed 0 deg/s, on the assumption that it should not have biases of either motion or
overall luminance.
A four-way ANOVA (stimulus type × gradient direction × motion direction × speed) revealed
significant main effects of stimulus type (F(2, 18) = 6.78, p = 0.0074), but the other main effects were
not significant (F < 1.38, p < 0.28). The four-way interaction (F(6, 48) = 5.80, p = 0.0001), and
one of the three-way interactions (stimulus type × gradient direction × motion direction: F(2, 16) =
15.37, p = 0.0002) were significant.
The effect of stimulus type is understood as an overall assimilation to the patch colour. In Figure 3,
the data are differently organised but the overall assimilation is visible: the white patches (W-G) made
the background look lighter while the black patches (B-G) made it look darker.
For the significant interactions, we then split the data by stimulus type. This allows analysis of the
data in terms of specific combinations of motion and gradients, e.g. a comparison of the case of leading
white edges versus trailing white edges for the W-G stimulus.

For the W-G stimuli, two-way ANOVA (motion type × speed) revealed significant effects of the
motion type (F(1, 8) = 23.3, p = 0.0013) and the interaction (F(3, 24) = 3.68, p = 0.026). Simple
main effect analysis showed that the effect of speed was significant for "white leading" (F(3, 24) =
3.18, p = 0.042) but not for "white trailing" (F(3, 24) = 1.99, p = 0.14). For the B-G stimuli, two-
way ANOVA (motion type × speed) revealed significant effects of the motion type (F(1, 8) = 12.4,
p = 0.0077) and the interaction (F(3, 24) = 5.19, p = 0.0066). Simple main effect analysis showed
that the effect of speed was significant for "black leading" (F(3, 24) = 3.18, p = 0.42) but it was not
for "black trailing" (F(3, 24) = 2.48, p = 0.085).
To summarise these results, the overall assimilation to the white or black patches was reduced
when the white or black edges were leading, and it was not significantly affected when these edges
were trailing.Aweak tendency of further assimilation by trailing white or black edges could contribute
to enhance the illusion, but this secondary effect was not statistically supported.
For the W-B stimuli, two-way ANOVA (motion type × speed) revealed no significant main effect
(motion type: F(1, 8) = 4.98, p = 0.056; speed: F(3, 24) = 2.02, p = 0.13) but the interaction was sig-
nificant (F(3, 24) = 4.21, p = 0.016). A significant simple main effect of speed was found for "white
leading" (F(3, 24) = 3.195, p = 0.042) but not for "black leading" (F(3, 24) = 2.68, p = 0.070). These
results are somewhat weaker or mixed, but are basically consistent with the effects of leading white or
black edges for W-G and B-G stimuli.
These asymmetrical effects of motion on lightness contrast and assimilation appear to be the basis
of the illusion (in which the elements of the same gradient direction move in opposite directions in the
two areas). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that motion affects lightness perception directly
(although see Agostini & Proffitt, 1993, for an effect of lightness contrast derived from "common fate"
of element movement). The effect at the leading edges seems more important than the effect at the trail-
ing edges. A remaining question is whether the gradient plays an essential role, or whether the lightness
contrast at the leading edges is the critical factor. This question was addressed in Experiment 2.
3 Experiment 2
To determine if the gradient is crucial, the effects of patches with black-to-white smooth gradient were
compared with those with black-and-white stepwise lightness changes. If the contrast of the leading
edge is the crucial factor, these two types of stimuli should have similar effects on the perceived light-
ness of the background. If, on the other hand, the gradient is essential, the latter would have much
smaller effects.
The results for W-B stimuli in Experiment 1 were less clear than the other two conditions. This
could be due to the steeper gradient with double the lightness change (compared to the W-G and B-G
stimuli) in the same space. We therefore doubled the width of each patch from those in Experiment 1. In
addition, the effect of stimulus speed could have been obscured by relatively free eye movement along
the motion axis. Fixation was therefore restricted in Experiment 2 to assess the effect of speed more
stringently.
3.1
Methods
3.1.1
Participants
Seven participants (including the two authors) were tested in Kyoto University. The naïve participants
were paid for their time according to the universities' standards. Two of the naïve participants only
participated in this experiment, and the others participated after they completed Experiment 1.
3.1.2
Stimuli
The stimuli were similar to those in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions (see Figure 4). The
width of the patches was doubled in order to keep the gradient slope the same as in the W-G and B-G
stimuli in Experiment 1. The number of patch columns was therefore reduced to 5. There were only
two types of patches: black-to-white gradient (gradient) and black-and-white steps (no gradient). Sta-
tionary patches were presented in the bottom rectangle to make the backgrounds look more similar
to each other. The patches in Experiment 2 had clear edges on both sides and did not show the previ-
ously mentioned artefacts of undesired lightness gaps between the patches and the background when
the background level was changed while the gradient remained the same. The spatial location (phase)
of the stationary patches was randomised for each trial. The stimuli moved at one of five speeds
Motion influences the perception of background lightness 45
(0.0, 1.48, 2.97, 5.93, or 8.90 deg/s), and a smaller fixation point (a white square of 0.3 × 0.3 deg) was
used to assess the effect of speed more clearly.
3.1.3
Procedure
The participants adjusted the background lightness of the bottom panel to match the perceived light-
ness (colour) of the top panel, as in Experiment 1. The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1
except that fixation was restricted to the centre horizontally as well as vertically.
3.2
Results
Matching errors were computed as in Experiment 1 (Figure 5). A two-way ANOVA (motion type ×
speed) was conducted separately for the two types of stimuli. For the no-gradient stimuli, the effect of
speed (F(4, 32) = 4.00, p = 0.0097) was significant but the effect of motion type (F(1, 8) = 0.324,
p = 0.58) or the interaction (F(4, 32) = 1.10, p = 0.38) was not. For the gradient stimuli, the effect
of motion type (F(1, 8) = 9.10, p = 0.017) and the interaction (F(4, 32) = 4.00, p = 0.0097) was
significant, but the effect of speed (F(4, 32) = 1.63, p = 0.19) was not. The simple main effect of
speed was significant for "black leading" (F(4, 32) = 4.98, p = 0.0031) but not for "white leading"
(F(4, 32) = 1.25, p = 0.31) stimuli. The effects of white and black edges in the gradient stimuli appear
asymmetric about the x axis, but it should be noted that these results are not consistent with those in
Experiment 1 where the effect of speed was significant only for "white leading". The overall shapes of
curves are similar and the effect of the gradient is evident, but it remains unclear whether the effect is
asymmetric as to the gradient direction.
Most importantly, the effect of motion type, i.e. the colour of the leading edge, was found only for
the gradient stimuli. A slightly reversed effect for the no-gradient stimuli at higher speed, although not
supported statistically, might reflect motion blur at the trailing edges overriding the contrast effect at
the weak leading edges, if any.

4 General discussion
4.1
Phenomenology
The illusion by Nakamura provides a striking and novel demonstration of the effects of motion on
lightness perception. The original artwork had black patches on a white background, but here it was
confirmed that the black and white patches have roughly symmetric effects on a grey background.
The black or white patches have an assimilation effect on the background when they are stationary,
and motion modulates this baseline assimilation. The effect of motion is characterised as lightning by
leading black edges, and darkening by leading white patches.
This effect might be related to a gain control process that enhances stimulus contrast at the lead-
ing edges and suppresses it at the trailing edges of moving elements (Arnold, Thompson, & Johnston,
2007). While this could account for the original Nakamura effect, it does not explain our result that a
luminance gradient is necessary for the illusion: leading edges of simple black or white patterns did
not work (Experiment 2).
On the basis of these findings, we propose a possible explanation for this illusion from a compu-
tational point of view.
4.2
Gradient-based motion detection
A role for spatiotemporal gradients in motion processing has been shown empirically. Anstis (1990)
reported that adapting to temporal luminance ramps (i.e. the luminance of an area changes in the form
of a sawtooth function) results in motion aftereffect of a test pattern. The aftereffect direction depends
on the polarity of the luminance edge between the test pattern and its background. More recently,
Scarfe and Johnston (2010) demonstrated that combination of aftereffects to spatial gradient and tem-
poral ramps produces a perception of motion. These findings are readily explained by the gradient
scheme of motion detection (e.g. Marr & Ullman, 1981) as we discuss next.
Gradient schemes compute local image velocity directly from spatial and temporal gradients.
Such schemes are popular in image processing (Horn & Schunck, 1981; Lucas & Kanade, 1981),
as well as in biological modelling (Johnston, McOwan, & Buxton, 1992; Marr & Ullman, 1981). In
addition, Harris (1980) proposed that velocity could be encoded by comparing the responses of flicker
and pattern systems on the basis of psychophysical results. Finally, a Japanese patent granted in 1976
(#1323442) encapsulates a similar idea (Takahiko Fukinuki, personal communication).
In the case of one-dimensional motion, local velocity v at a location x in image I is essentially
derived as v = -(I/t)/(I/x). In other words, local speed is given by the temporal gradient divided
by the spatial gradient. This one-dimensional model is useful for biological modelling because neu-
rons in the primary visual cortex mostly have one-dimensional receptive fields (e.g. Daugman,
1985; Parker & Hawken, 1988), feeding to later stages of integration orientation and space. The
gradient scheme is conceptually different from other major models of motion detection, such as
motion energy (Adelson & Bergen, 1985) or the Reichardt detector (Reichardt, 1961; van Santen &
Sperling, 1985), but the actual shapes of the implemented filters can be quite similar (Mather, 1994).
Motion energy and Reichardt models do not provide estimates of invariant speed at the detector
level, and a proposed scheme of computing speed by the ratio of high- and low-speed detector out-
puts (Adelson & Bergen, 1985) resembles the gradient scheme. Actually, the original motion energy
model was constructed by using Gaussian derivatives as the spatial filters. Discussion on the basis of
a simple gradient scheme, therefore, could be informative even if one does not support the gradient
scheme against the others.
Murakami et al. (2006) proposed a schematic model of the "Rotating Snakes" illusion (Kitaoka
& Ashida, 2003) using a modified gradient scheme. The "Rotating Snakes" figure is composed of
repeated patterns of four colours (typically black-blue-white-yellow) that give rise to asymmetric
spatial luminance gradients. With small involuntary eye movements (drift), the retinal image shifts
and gives rise to temporal gradients at each point. Asymmetric motion responses can be derived if
either the spatial or temporal gradient is slightly biased in one direction. While it is unrealistic to
assume biased spatial derivative filters, the temporal derivative filters are causal and more likely
have an imbalance of positive and negative lobes of their impulse response, which would introduce
a bias. The assumption that decrease of contrast is overestimated compared to increase of contrast
(see Figure 9 in Murakami et al., 2006), which is consistent with psychophysically derived temporal
impulse responses (Burr & Morrone, 1993; Hisakata & Murakami, 2008), explains the observed
illusory motion.
Motion influences the perception of background lightness 47
4.3
A schematic model of the Nakamura illusion
This assumption of overestimation of decreasing contrast and underestimation of increasing con-
trast (Murakami et al., 2006) can explain the Nakamura illusion. Consider the temporal changes of
lightness (or luminance) at one horizontal location (shown by the dashed black line in the insets of
Figure 6). The lightness physically changes as shown by the black lines in each combination of gra-
dient and motion. The red lines show expected representation of lightness with the assumption of a
biased gradient computation as described above.
The primary effect of lightness contrast was found when the white or black edge was leading
(Figure 6a and b). In these cases, the lightness contrast suddenly reaches the maximum, and then
gradually decreases. The temporal gradient of decreasing contrast is overestimated by the biased fil-
ters, which would yield darkening in Figure 6(a) or whitening in Figure 6(b) at the end of the gradient.
This overshoot could continue into the grey area and cause the contrast effects on the background
as shown by the dashed red lines. The effect was not clear when the white or black edge is trailing
(Figure 6c and d). Here, the effect of biased smooth gradient may not affect the background
after the final steep edge. A possible slight overshoot may be cancelled or overcome by motion
blur at the edges. Prediction is even less straightforward when the gradient ranges white to black
(Figure 6e and f). In Figure 6(e), the red lines were simply copied and connected from Figure 6(a) and
(d). This would result in slight underestimation of the lightness at the end of the patch. Similarly, in
Figure 6(f), red lines are copied from Figure 6(b) and (c). The bias in the first half is not completely
nulled in the second half, but it is uncertain what happens at the final edge. Unlike in Figure 6(c) and (d),
the effect of gradient bias and that of motion blur may be in the same direction.
Note that possible biases at the edges are not considered in Figure 6. While the gradient has
infinite slope at the edge, retinal and neural images are blurred and should have measurable gradient
slopes, which should be also biased. This possibility is ignored here in the interests of simplicity, but
the scheme remains valid at least in the crucial conditions of Figure 6(a) and (b), where the effect
should be enhanced if the initial contrast increase is underestimated. In Figure 6(c­f), lightness con-
trast could have been enhanced by overestimation of the trailing edges, which could also be true with
the B-W stimuli. This did not seem to happen, however, suggesting that the steep edges have little
effect in the modulation of lightness.
Figure 6. Gradient-based explanation of the Nakamura illusion. The time-course of the lightness change at one
location (shown by the vertical black dashed line in the inset) is plotted for each type of element and each motion
direction in Experiment 1. Solid black lines show the actual lightness change. Red lines show the predicted
representation of lightness, assuming that increment and decrement slopes are biased by a fixed ratio of 1.4
(arbitrarily set for illustration). Dashed blue lines show possible effects of motion blur at the edges.

Lightness contrast may be modulated laterally (i.e. vertically in this case) in the top and bottom
portions of the surrounding background. It is then possible that the steep edges had (apparently) little
effect simply because the areas above and below the edges are small compared to the areas along the
smooth gradient.
The crucial effect of enhanced lightness contrast, as shown in Figure 6(a) and (b), is well captured
by this simple scheme, but only qualitatively. In order to develop a more quantitative model, more
assumptions are needed about several unknown properties. Most importantly, it is not known how
temporal gradient responses interact with the static representation of lightness, given the possible
separate pathways for motion (mainly in the dorsal stream) and colour (mainly in the ventral stream)
(Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; Vaina, 1994). Figure 6 assumes an immediate update of lightness repre-
sentation by the temporal gradient, but this is not realistic, and some postdictive integration may need
to be introduced. Also, static lightness contrast and assimilation are not considered in Figure 6, which
should be somehow implemented in a quantitative model. Finally, motion blur may also need to be
quantified.
4.4
Concluding remarks
Nakamura's illusion of moving gradients opens the door to further inquiries into novel interactions
between motion and lightness. A greater understanding of this phenomenon could enhance knowledge
about the integration of visual features after relatively independent initial processing. The illusion
appears to be readily explained by a scheme of motion detection based on spatiotemporal gradients.

Hiroshi Ashida received BA, MA, and PhD at Kyoto University (psychology).
After working as a postdoctoral researcher at ATR Human Information
Processing Research Laboratories, research associate at Kyoto University,
and associate professor at Ritsumeikan University, he is now working as an
associate professor at Kyoto University. His main research interest is visual
processing of motion and visual illusion in general. He also studies with fMRI
after he learned the basics at Royal Holloway, UK, in 2004­2005.
Nicholas E. Scott-Samuel has a BA in Philosophy (University of Bristol) and
an MSc in Cognitive Science (University of Birmingham). His PhD on human
visual motion processing was supervised by Mark Georgeson (University
of Birmingham), and was followed by postdocs with Andy Smith (Royal
Holloway, University of London) and Robert Hess (McGill University). He is
currently a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol.
