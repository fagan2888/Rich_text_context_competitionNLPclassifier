Dynamics of Urban Informal Labor Supply
in the United States

Objective. This study provides the first panel data estimates of informal work in the United States
and explores relationships between informal- and regular-sector participation among urban parents
of young children. Methods. I examine determinants of informal-sector participation in five waves
of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study using probit, pooled Tobit, and
fixed-effects OLS models. Results. Approximately 53 percent of urban fathers and 32 percent of
urban mothers with young children pursue informal work over a nine-year period. Informal work
most often occurs in conjunction with regular work. Workers who work in both sectors in the same
year are more likely to be nonminority race, higher education (mothers only), own credit cards,
and work in skilled white- or blue-collar occupations. Workers who ever participate in only the
informal sector are more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to have never worked
in the regular sector. Informal participation spells are shorter than regular-sector participation
spells and are associated with changes in regular-sector participation and occupation but not most
other life events. Conclusion. Consistent with past work, informal work among parents of young
children is widespread across socioeconomic groups. Transitions in and out of the informal sector
are strongly related to changes in regular-sector employment and occupation. The results suggest
that regular-sector participation provides access to informal work opportunities.
The estimated magnitude of the informal economy in the United States was between 7
and 10 percent of official gross national product during the late 1990s and 2000s (Dell'Ano
and Solomon, 2008; Schneider, 2005; Schneider and Enste, 2000), but we know relatively
little about the dynamics of informal labor supply. This article uses recent panel data on
participation in informal economic activity from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
Study to examine factors associated with workers' participation and transitions in and out
of the informal sector.
Past studies of informal work in the United States have used cross-sectional data and
focused on small geographic areas and select populations, such as welfare and working-poor
mothers in four U.S. cities (Edin and Lein 1997a, 1997b), low-income mothers in Boston,
Chicago, and San Antonio (Lein et al., 2005), Mexican immigrants in California (Marcelli,
Pastor, and Joassert, 1999; Marcelli, 2004, 2010), workers in rural Pennsylvania (Jensen,
Cornwell, and Findeis, 1995; Slack and Jensen, 2010) and rural Wisconsin (Larrivee and
Schaffer, 2007), and the self-employed on New York's Lower East Side (Snyder, 2004).
Although each of these studies provides significant insights into the informal work activities
of a particular group at a particular place and time, none provides a nationally representative

description of informal economic activity in the United States. Furthermore, by looking
only at particular groups, the studies presuppose which groups are most likely to have high
informal labor force participation (Joassart, 2010).
This study updates and significantly expands our knowledge about informal economy
participation by examining a much broader population and by incorporating panel data,
which permits examination of transitions in and out of informal work. The article uses
data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, the first large-scale panel
survey that includes data on informal work in the United States, and results are nationally
representative of parents of children born during 1998­2000 in cities with population over
200,000.
Results reveal widespread participation in informal work: over the course of the nine-year
panel, 53 percent of urban fathers with young children and 32 percent of urban mothers
with young children report working informally. Between 16 and 30 percent of urban
fathers and 11 to 15 percent of urban mothers report some form of informal work each
year. The rates of informal participation in the panel data are much higher than revealed
by many previous cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, informal work frequently occurs
in conjunction with regular-sector employment. Men generally work in the regular and
informal sectors simultaneously, but women are equally likely to work in both sectors or
in only the informal sector. Consistent with past work summarized by Williams (2010),
probit regressions show that informal work among urban U.S. parents of young children
is widespread across socioeconomic groups and is not limited to marginalized populations.
Workers who work informally in conjunction with regular work are more likely to be
nonminority race, higher education (mothers only), own credit cards, and work in skilled
white- or blue-collar occupations. Workers who ever participate in only the informal sector
are more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to have never worked in the
regular sector.
The panel data reveal that informal economy participation spells are short but intense.
Conditional on working in the informal sector, individuals work informally for 16­23
hours per week and 18­20 weeks per year on average. Consistent with the short spells,
urban parents transition into and out of the informal sector frequently. Panel fixed-effects
regressions show that transitions into the informal sector are strongly related to changes
in regular-sector employment and occupation. Working in the regular sector is associated
with a 2 to 6 percentage point decrease in the probability of informal work. I do not find
an association between informal work transitions and other life events, including changes
in family structure, incarceration, health, and social program receipt.
Simultaneous participation in the regular and informal sectors and the relationship
between regular-sector occupation changes and participation in informal work both suggest
that regular-sector positions provide individuals with access to short-term informal-sector
opportunities. Although participation in informal work is driven in part by individuals
who face barriers to work in the regular sector or who have exited the formal sector entirely,
many informal workers appear to use the skills or relationships they gain through regular
employment to take advantage of alternative earning opportunities.
Theories of Participation in Informal Economic Activity
Hart (1973) introduced the term "informal sector" in the scholarly literature in a study
of Ghanaian rural-to-urban migrants. Subsequent work in both developing and developed
country contexts used varying definitions of the informal, hidden, underground, or shadow
18 Social Science Quarterly
economy. In 2003, the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians formally
defined the informal sector as consisting of licit but unreported economic activity (i.e.,
activities that are inherently legal but are unreported to tax, social security, and labor law
agencies) (International Labour Organization, 2003). The European Commission (2007)
uses a similar definition of undeclared work in official communication and this definition
is common in scholarly work (Williams, 2010).
Participation in the informal economy has been studied in both developed and developing
country contexts and has traditionally been divided between the exclusion/marginality view
and the exit view, as summarized by Chen (2012), Perry and Maloney (2007), and Williams
(2010). The exclusion lens views informal-sector workers and small firms as engaging in
marginal activities because they are prevented from participating in the regular sector by
a segmented labor market, strict or costly regulations, or other cost differences associated
with informality. In contrast, the exit lens draws on the work of Hirschman (1970) and
views participation in informal economic activity as a deliberate choice to avoid regulation
and formality. Feige (1997), G¨
erxhani (2004a, 2004b), and Williams, Horodnik, and
Windebank (2015) draw on work in transition economies and comparisons across E.U.
countries to advance an alternative view, drawing on institutional theory and public choice,
that informal activity rises due to conflict between formal and informal institutions, but
empirical tests (G¨
erxhani, 2004b; Williams, Horodnic, and Windebank, 2015) do not
clearly distinguish between this theory and alternatives.
Recent work acknowledges the role of both exit and exclusion. Chen (2012) and Perry
and Maloney (2007) argue that exclusion is more applicable to off-the-books work for
employers while exit more accurately characterizes informal self-employment. Women
may be more likely to face exclusion but also may be more likely to exit due to desire
for flexibility in balancing work and household responsibilities (Perry and Maloney, 2007;
Lein et al., 2005). Exit may be more relevant in developed economies (Williams, Horodnic,
and Windebank, 2015), but even among developing countries there is a wide variation in
history, legal systems, and institutions that may affect the relative importance of exit and
exclusion (Perry et al., 2007).
Public finance economists, in the tradition of Allingham and Sandmo's (1972) sem-
inal article, have viewed informal work in the United States and Canada as a strategic
response to differences in returns to work across sectors and have focused on the ef-
fects of tax rates and penalties in developed countries: see Slemrod and Yitzhaki (2002)
for a review of the literature. Empirical studies generally find that higher tax and au-
dit rates do increase behaviors associated with the informal sector. While the pub-
lic finance literature is crucial for understanding the effects of tax and social policy,
its focus on single factors does not provide a complete explanation of informal-sector
participation.
This article uses panel data on transitions in and out of informal work to examine
an alternative possibility: workers may use regular-sector employment to access informal
opportunities. Regular-sector experience can provide workers with skills, connections, and
other resources that facilitate opportunities for informal work, particularly of a part-time or
project-based nature. This is consistent with Williams's (2010:14) review of the literature
finding that "informal work chiefly benefits those already in employment." This contrasts
strongly with the exclusion view in which informal work is a second-best alternative. Unlike
the exclusion view, the opportunities depend on participation in the regular sector. In the
next section, I examine the relationship between regular and informal-sector participation
and the key characteristics associated with informal-sector participation across individuals
and within individuals over time.

Data
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey, conducted by Princeton University's
Center for Research on Child Wellbeing, was designed to study family situations following
welfare reform. A total of 4,898 hospital births occurring between 1998 and 2000 in 20
U.S. cities with populations of over 200,000 were sampled, and separate mother and father
interviews were obtained at birth and at the child's first, third, fifth, and ninth birthdays. The
resulting labor force participation data span years 1997 to 2009. Nonmarital births were
oversampled relative to marital births. Reichman et al. (2001) provide detailed information
about the sampling scheme.
When sample weights are used, results are nationally representative of parents with babies
born in 1998­2000 in cities with populations over 200,000. Although this is a restricted
sample, the Fragile Families study provides a wider view of the informal economy than we
have seen to date and provides the first survey data on transitions in and out of informal
economic activity. The data are particularly valuable for studying urban prime-age working
fathers. Results for new mothers are not generalizable to other women because the data
show that mothers' work patterns change significantly during the years following the birth
of a child.
The Fragile Families survey captures information about both regular work and illegal
activity and legal activities that are not reported to tax or regulatory authorities. Survey
professionals distinguished between regular and informal work by instructing respondents
to include regular income from self-employment or their own business as regular-sector
work. Respondents were then asked: "We are interested in finding out about some ways,
other than regular work, in which people make money. This kind of activity may be paid
for in cash, or done in exchange for meals, or clothing, or a place to live, or something else.
Please tell me if you have done any of the following in the last 12 months: work off the
books or under the table (waves 1­3 only); work in your own business; sell or deliver drugs,
engage in prostitution, or do other kinds of hustles; or do anything else to earn money?"
Respondents reported their form of compensation, earnings, weeks worked per year, and
average hours worked per week for both regular and each type of informal work. Fathers
were asked these questions in all five waves and mothers answered these questions for the
four waves after the baseline.
I follow the International Labour Organization (2003) definition of informal work as
licit but unreported work as closely as possible. I define respondents as working informally
if they report monetary compensation for working off the books, in their own business,
or doing anything else to earn money. I do not include drug sales, prostitution, and
other hustles. I also exclude informal work for which respondents receive only noncash
compensation. Only 3.4 percent of fathers and less than 0.5 percent of mothers report illicit
activity across the entire panel. Excluding informal work done for noncash compensation
has similarly minimal effects: including it increases overall participation in the informal
economy by only 1 (fathers) to 1.5 (mothers) percentage points.
Methods
I use probit models to examine the characteristics of individuals who work informally
at some point in the Fragile Families panel. I regress an indicator for ever participating in
informal work on a vector of control variables, including age at baseline; race indicators;
indicators for ever married during the survey, ever cohabiting, and ever having children
in the household; education at baseline; ever worked in regular sector; average household
20 Social Science Quarterly
income from sources other than the respondent's labor; ever incarcerated; social safety net
participation; car ownership and use of financial services; times moved; health limitations;
and type of regular-sector occupation.
I next take advantage of the panel data to investigate the frequent transitions in and
out of the informal sector. I use fixed-effects regressions to model within-individual vari-
ation in participation in informal work over time. In addition to time variation in the
variables described previously, I control for time-varying state economic conditions: state
unemployment rates, minimum wages, and refundable state earned income tax credits. The
individual fixed-effects control for all time-invariant observable and unobservable individ-
ual characteristics. Last, I use pooled Tobit and panel fixed-effects regressions to examine
annual hours worked in the informal sector.
Descriptive Analysis: Informal Work Patterns
Table 1 shows unweighted and weighted summary statistics for the full Fragile Fam-
ilies sample. The average age of respondents at baseline was 25 in the raw data and 27
after weighting. Three-quarters of the respondents were either black or Hispanic. The
unweighted sample is disproportionately low education, with 34 percent of the respon-
dents reporting less than a high school education in the first wave. Average educational
attainment increased over the survey period.
Although the survey design specified that only one-quarter of the births in the sample
were to married couples, an additional 44 percent of fathers and 36 percent of mothers
surveyed report cohabiting. Respondents averaged two biological children in the first wave.
At baseline, fathers' unweighted average household income was $50,837 (all income in
2011 $), very close to 1999 median household income for central city households of
$48,030 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). The weighted income is similar to the 1999 median
for all U.S. households of $55,109 but below the median for family households of $66,820,
reflecting fathers who live apart from their children. Mothers' average household income
was lower than fathers' at $43,320, but well above the 1999 median for female householders
with no spouse present of $35,326. Nineteen percent of mothers reported receiving TANF
benefits during the past year.
Fathers were most likely to work in occupations relating to precision production, craft,
or repair (25 percent at baseline); service (18 percent); or as handlers, equipment cleaners,
or laborers (13.5 percent). Mothers were most likely to work in service (33 percent at
baseline) or administrative support (24 percent). By the fifth wave, nearly one-quarter
of fathers in the sample had spent time in jail, in line with high incarceration rates for
black and Hispanic men. Nearly one-fifth of mothers in the sample received Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and 45 percent received food stamps.
Table 2 shows that most urban fathers work a regular job. Annual regular-sector partic-
ipation ranges between 83 and 88 percent across waves, and overall fathers are employed
in the regular sector in 86 percent of person-year observations (column 1). (Statistics by
wave are available from the author.) Ninety-six percent of urban fathers worked in the
regular sector at some point during the survey period (column 2). Regular-sector labor
force participation is lower for mothers, and only 76 percent of urban mothers worked in
the regular sector at some point. It is important to remember, however, that all mothers
in the survey have at least one child under age nine in every wave. Mothers' labor force
participation does increase as their children age, rising from 51 percent in wave 2 to 61
percent in wave 5.

24 Social Science Quarterly
Informal-sector participation rates are high. Fathers report participated in informal work
in 23 percent of person-year observations (Table 2, column 1), with rates varying from 18
to 31 percent across waves. Mothers report informal work in 14 percent of person-year
observations. These participation rates are similar to those estimated by O'Neill (1983) and
somewhat higher than those found by Lemieux, Fortin, and Frechette (1994). Edin and
Lein (1997a) found much higher annual participation rates of 32­52 percent among the
subpopulation of welfare mothers and 20­37 percent of low-income wage-reliant mothers
in particular cities, but their study concentrates on low-income mothers rather than all
urban mothers. Informal participation rates are lowest in waves 4 and 5 when the survey
did not ask explicitly about off-the-books work.
The unique longitudinal aspect of the Fragile Families data reveals that an impressive
53 percent of urban fathers and 32 percent of urban mothers of young children work
informally during the nine-year survey. Edin and Lein (1997a) warn that it is difficult to
get accurate responses to survey questions about informal work because of the incentives
to hide income information from welfare caseworkers and other officials. There is no way
to know the extent of underreporting in the Fragile Families data, but the possibility of
underreporting makes the high rates of informal work participation found in the data
particularly noteworthy.
Overall, fathers reported working in both sectors in 18.8 percent of father-year obser-
vations, but work exclusively in the informal sector in only 4 percent of observations. It
appears that, for urban fathers of young children, informal work is almost always under-
taken in conjunction with regular work. This may explain why Rich, Garfinkel, and Gao
(2007) do not find evidence that strong child support enforcement increases annual hours
of work in the underground: if fathers continue to work in the regular sector, they will still
be subject to child support enforcement. These fathers have neither fully exited the regular
labor market nor are they excluded from it.
The patterns for mothers of young children are quite different. In contrast to the
experience of women in developing countries (International Labour Organization, 2014),
mothers report lower levels of informal-sector participation than men and mothers are
equally likely to work in both sectors or in only the informal sector. Because of the
differences in informal work by gender, I conduct the rest of the analysis separately for
men and women. This contributes further to the literature, as Windebank and Williams
(2010:82) observe that "the work relations and motives underpinning the informal work
undertaken by men and women [in developed nations] have not been investigated." Edin
and Lein (1997a,1997b) find that mothers may use the informal sector to shield income
from welfare agencies, an exit motivation. Women might also be less likely to work in jobs
or occupations that allow substitution between informal and regular work or women could
be unable to work as many hours as men due to child-care or home production demands.
This is consistent with the findings of Windebank and Williams (2010), who use data
from the English Localities Survey and report that men's informal work is generally more
similar to regular work, while women's is more like unpaid work and is often a formal way
to trade favors among friends, neighbors, and family members. Gender differences should
be interpreted cautiously, however, because they may be specific to stage of life and the
period following birth of a child.
Off-the-books activities are the most common type of work for urban fathers in each
wave, with 29 percent working under the table at some point during the survey and 13­16
percent working under the table in each wave. Over a quarter of urban fathers operate
their own business. Individuals may change how they define their work from one wave
to another, especially because the survey discontinued the "off-the-books" option after
wave 3.
Dynamics of Urban Informal Labor Supply in the United States 25
Columns 3­8 of Table 2 show cumulative participation rates by sector and race across
all waves of the survey. White- and blue-collar fathers have similarly high rates of informal-
sector participation at 57 and 55 percent, respectively, while 46 percent of service-worker
fathers work informally across the panel. Fathers' informal-sector participation is higher for
whites (59 percent) than for blacks and Hispanics (53 and 48 percent). The key differences
across regular-sector occupation types become visible when examining how fathers combine
regular and informal work. White-collar fathers not only have the highest rates of informal
work, but they are most likely to combine regular and informal work in the same year. They
have the lowest rates of off-the-books work. They are disproportionately likely to work
informally in their own business at 32 percent. Fathers in the service industry, on the other
hand, are about equally likely to work only in the informal sector but are much less likely to
work in both the regular and informal sectors, suggesting that it is much more difficult to
substitute between regular and informal work in service industry jobs. Blue-collar fathers
fall somewhere between white-collar and service industry fathers regarding work in both
sectors versus work in the informal sector only, but their informal work is characterized
by a high rate of off-the-books work, with 36.5 percent of blue-collar fathers reporting
off-the-books work over the three-year period this question was asked.
The divide between white-collar and service work in terms of regular versus informal
participation does not occur for mothers. Mothers in the service industry are slightly more
likely to work informally than white-collar mothers (37 vs. 31 percent) and are more likely
to work in the informal sector or not work during some point in the panel. Mothers in
service are also more likely to work off the books than mothers in white-collar jobs, but
have similar rates of working informally in their own business. The sample of mothers in
blue-collar jobs is quite small (n = 264), but their labor force participation is characterized
primarily by low rates of regular-sector work rather than unusual patterns of informal work.
These results suggest that certain types of regular-sector work are more likely to pro-
vide specific kinds of informal-sector opportunities, with white-collar work facilitating
self-employment and blue-collar work disproportionately providing opportunities off the
books. This contrasts with the exclusion view of informal work, in which lack of opportu-
nities in the regular sector drives informal-sector participation, or the exit view, in which
rejection of regular-sector constraints or restrictions drives informal work.
Table 3 shows that, conditional on working in the regular sector, men work 46­49
hours per week on average while women work between 35 and 41 hours: this holds across
subgroups. Informal work represents a serious time commitment on the part of many
urban families. Fathers and mothers who work informally average 22 and 16 hours per
week, respectively, with service workers and Hispanic mothers working more informal
hours. Interestingly, these stints of informal work appear comparatively short-lived. While
fathers report working in the regular sector for 47 weeks annually on average, they report
working off the books for only 12 weeks annually and in their own business 31 weeks
annually. Mothers' stints in the informal sector are comparable and also shorter than their
spells in the regular sector. White-collar fathers and Hispanic mothers and service industry
mothers have comparatively long stints. These short stints might suggest project-based
informal opportunities that workers access through their regular-sector participation, but
this cannot be determined with the data. Alternately, they could indicate failure of informal
enterprises or exhaustion on the part of workers trying to maintain participation in both
sectors.
Table 3 also reports average reported earnings for regular work and informal work,
conditional on participation. The summary statistics suggest that average hourly wages in
most of the informal sector are similar to, and sometimes higher than, those in the regular

than pooling the data across waves, informal wages are slightly lower than regular-sector
wages. Average informal hourly wages are almost always well above the minimum wage
for all gender, race, and occupation categories. These wages are similar to those found
among informal day laborers in New York by Melendez, Theodore, and Valenzuela (2010),

who point out that the hourly rate is high but that the unstable nature of day laboring
results in low monthly wages. The high hourly wages also reflect the predomination of
coincident regular-sector and informal-sector work and the prevalence of informal work
across occupations, and further suggest that many informal opportunities can best be
accessed through regular-sector participation.
Tables 2 and 3 show that participation rates in informal work are high, especially among
men, but informal work spells are short relative to spells in the regular sector. This is
consistent with the high cumulative participation rate in the informal economy over the
five-year survey period, in which half of all fathers and over one-fourth of mothers worked
informally. The short spells and high cumulative participation suggest frequent transitions
in and out of the informal sector.
Figure 1 explores transitions between sectors across waves. Approximately three-quarters
of workers who work only in the regular sector in any wave continue to work exclusively
in that sector in the next wave. Compared to them, workers who work in both sectors or
in the informal sector only are much more likely to work informally in the next period.
Working in only the informal sector is associated with much higher rates of subsequent
nonwork. Interestingly, this is not true in the opposite direction: those who work in
neither sector in one wave are less likely to work informally in the subsequent wave
than the population at large. For both fathers and mothers, working in both sectors in
one wave is associated with lower rates of work in neither sector in subsequent waves,
suggesting that those who work in both sectors are strongly positioned to access future
opportunities.
The descriptive statistics suggest that exclusion from the formal sector does not fully
explain participation in informal economic activity. First, informal work typically oc-
curs simultaneously with regular-sector work. Second, informal work is widespread, with
more than half of prime-age urban fathers working informally at some point over the
course of a decade. Third, transitions in and out of the informal sector occur frequently,
but working in both sectors is associated with the lowest rates of neither-sector work
in subsequent waves. Combined, these patterns indicate that regular-sector work pro-
vides access to valuable and flexible informal opportunities for some workers but need

not result in exit from the regular sector. I next turn to a further examination of par-
ticipation in informal work and factors driving transitions in and out of the informal
sector.
Regression Results
Table 4 shows the average marginal effects from probit regressions of ever working
informally on a vector of personal characteristics using data from waves 1­4 (fathers) and
2­4 (mothers). Results using waves 1­5 (and consequently excluding occupation data)
are similar. Coefficients from OLS regressions are nearly identical to the probit marginal
effects. Results are shown for ever working informally, ever working in both regular and
informal sectors in the same year, and ever working only in the informal sector.
Age at baseline is negatively related to informal work overall and only informal work,
but not to working in both sectors. Because the sample is based on births, this may be
picking up characteristics of parents who are older when they have children rather than the
relationship of age to informal work, although Lemieux, Fortin, and Frechette (2004) do
find that age is negatively related to informal work. Ever-married mothers are 4 percentage
points more likely to report informal work than their never-married counterparts, and
fathers who live with children at some point in the sample period are significantly more
likely to report informal work. Not having a high school diploma at baseline is associated
with a 5 percentage point increase in the probability of informal work for fathers.
Hispanic fathers are less likely to report working informally than their white counterparts.
This effect is mitigated by controlling for citizenship: citizen fathers are 12­15 percentage
points more likely to report informal work. If this indicates reporting differences across
citizen and noncitizen Hispanics, then the true rate of informal work is even higher than
reported. Hispanic mothers are 7 to 8 percentage points less likely to report working
informally, all else equal. Black mothers are also 4 to 5 percentage points less likely to
report working informally than their white counterparts, with no effect for mothers who
work in both sectors.
Ever working in the regular sector has no significant effect on informal work for fathers
overall, which is expected due to the very high rates of men's participation in regular work
and consequent lack of identifying variation. No effect is found for women either. Ever
working in the regular sector reduces the probability of working only in the informal sector
by 14 percentage points for men and 9 percentage points for women. Fathers who work
in either white- or blue-collar jobs are 3 percentage points more likely to work informally
than service workers, and these effects are driven by fathers who work in precision pro-
duction/craft/repair, as handlers/equipment cleaners/laborers, and in professional/technical
fields. Mothers who work additional waves in white-collar jobs are 1 percentage point less
likely to work informally.
Other indicators of stability and financial sophistication are strongly related to ever
participating in informal work. Having a credit card is associated with informal work
participation for both men and women, although there is no relationship between having a
bank account and informal work. Number of times moved during the panel is also strongly
associated with informal participation, with each additional move corresponding to a 1 to
2 percentage point increase in the probability of informal work. Bruinsma (2006) observes
that moving restricts families' access to networks of friends and family who can assist with
childcare and that it takes considerable time to establish new networks, which may explain
the increased reliance on informal work associated with moving.

Dynamics of Urban Informal Labor Supply in the United States 31
Fathers who spend time in jail or prison are 8­11 percentage points more likely to
report informal work, but the effect for mothers is not significant. Mothers who ever report
that their health limits their work are significantly more likely to report informal work, but
health limitations affect informal work only for fathers' participation in only informal work.
I also find a relationship between reliance on the social safety net and informal work for
fathers who ever received food stamps and mothers who ever received food stamps or TANF.
Overall, the results show that different characteristics are associated with informal work
done in conjunction with regular-sector work versus working only in the informal sector.
Being a citizen, having spent time in jail or prison, receiving food stamps, and moving
are positively associated with both types of informal work and are consistent with tra-
ditional portrayals of informal workers as those excluded from regular-sector work. But
other characteristics suggest that many of those who work in both sectors simultaneously
are comparatively economically advantaged. Respondents who ever report participating in
both regular and informal work in the same year are less likely to be black (fathers only)
and Hispanic, more likely to own credit cards, more likely to have some college (mothers
only), and fathers are more likely to work in skilled white- or blue-collar occupations
such as professional/technical fields or precision production/craft/repair. This is consistent
with regular-sector work providing access to additional informal opportunities. In contrast,
respondents who ever report participating only in the informal sector are relatively econom-
ically disadvantaged. They are more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to
have never worked in the regular sector. Mothers are more likely to have received TANF.
Next, I take advantage of the panel data to investigate individuals' changes in informal
work participation over time. Table 5 shows results from panel fixed-effects regressions.
(Conditional logit models did not converge. Probit marginal effects and OLS coefficients
are nearly identical in the ever participate regressions, suggesting that the linearity constraint
is not problematic in this context.) Not all variables are available in all waves: column 1 uses
data from all waves while other columns introduce variables available only in some waves.
These models use only the variation in an individual's informal work activity over time,
rather than variations across individuals. A key advantage of this method is that it controls
for time-invariant components of individuals' taste for informal work and identifies changes
in circumstances that drive informal participation.
The dominant finding of Table 5 is that fathers' informal participation is strongly
related to regular-sector job in that wave. Working in the regular sector decreases mothers'
informal-sector participation by 2 percentage points, but the results are not significant
across all specifications. For fathers, working in a regular job during the past year is
associated with a 4 to 6 percentage point reduction in the probability of informal work,
consistent with the view that workers turn to the informal sector when regular work
is unavailable. But the high rates of employment for fathers mean that the variation in
regular work can only explain part of the variation in informal work. Transitions in regular
employment type also have strong explanatory power: switching to a blue-collar job increases
the rate of informal work by 7 percentage points. Results using more detailed occupation
indicators (not shown) find large effects for certain blue- and white-collar professions: a 6
percentage point increase in probability for handlers/equipment cleaners/laborers and 10 to
11 percentage point increases for professional/technical workers, salesmen, and workers in
precision production/craft/repair fields. Again, this is consistent with certain regular-sector
positions providing access to additional informal earning opportunities.
Although the results for ever working informally in Table 4 show a relationship between
informal work and stability variables, including incarceration, social safety net receipt, and
credit card access, the panel fixed-effects regressions do not show a connection between the

timing of these events and informal work. The lack of incarceration effect is particularly
interesting because changes in incarceration status capture changes in barriers to regular-
sector participation due to employer screening for criminal history. Mothers work less in the
informal sector when state minimum wages are higher. I do not find effects for state Earned
Income Tax Credits (EITCs) or state unemployment rates. Number of moves since the last
wave is significantly related to the probability of informal work for fathers, suggesting that
informal workers' situations are less stable. The results also do not show effects on informal
participation from life events such as marriage or divorce, children living in the household,
or changes in health that limit work. Robustness checks (not shown) that included other
life events including the death of a parent and transformative religious experience also did
not reveal relationships with informal work. The variables most closely related to changes
in informal work are measures of regular work participation.
I also examine the intensiveness of informal activity using annual hours of informal work
as the dependent variable. (Results are available from the author.) Black mothers report
more hours of work conditional on working informally. Working in the regular sector is
negatively related to informal hours worked in both the pooled cross-section and panel
regressions for fathers, but the results disappear when controls for occupation are added
(and, consequently, wave 5 data are excluded). Increases in other household income are
associated with fewer hours of informal work. The regressions reveal several relationships
between financial assets and service use and informal work intensity. Fathers' access to
credit cards is positively associated with informal hours worked across specifications. The
reasons are not clear: this may be because informal work and credit spending are both
used to smooth income, or credit spending might be used to finance costs associated with
setting up small businesses. Mothers with bank accounts work significantly fewer hours in
the informal sector, while mothers who own vehicles work significantly more hours.
The strong relationship between fathers' occupation and participation in informal
work is less apparent when we examine intensity in the informal sector. The pooled
Tobit regressions do not reveal any relationships between occupation and hours. The
fixed-effects regressions find higher hours for sales and transportation/material moving.
However, conditioning on informal participation and controlling for individual fixed-
effects results in estimates based on the small number of individuals who transition be-
tween sectors across waves, which is particularly limiting for mothers due to lower rates of
informal work.
Discussion
Data from the largest, most widely representative survey of informal work in the United
States reaffirm several results from prior studies focusing on subpopulations. Informal work
is widespread across socioeconomic groups and is not limited to marginalized populations:
although participants in the informal economy are more likely to be young, less-educated,
reliant on social safety net programs, and formerly incarcerated, they are also more likely
to be white, U.S. citizens, married, work in the regular sector, have a credit card, and
(for men) work in professional or technical fields. Men's and women's informal work
patterns differ greatly, and while men generally work in the regular and informal sectors
simultaneously, women are equally likely to work in both sectors or only the informal sector.
The longitudinal data reveal that the population of informal workers is even broader than
previously documented: over half of all urban fathers of young children and more than a
quarter of urban mothers work informally at some point during a nine-year period. The data
34 Social Science Quarterly
also show the frequent transitions in and out of the informal sector. Only 3 percent of fathers
and 2 percent of mothers work informally in all waves. Workers transition in and out of
short but intense informal work spells, and transitions into the informal sector are correlated
with exiting the regular sector and, for fathers, changes in regular-sector occupation.
The attributes associated with informal work include both characteristics associated
with marginalized populations and traits associated with strong financial resources and
labor market attachment. The apparent tension between these attributes can be largely
resolved by separately considering informal work that is undertaken simultaneously with
regular work, and complements it, versus informal work that substitutes for regular-sector
work during periods of unemployment. Experience in skilled white- or blue-collar occu-
pations increases the probability of working in both sectors simultaneously, and changes
in occupation are one of the few observable individual characteristics correlated with
changes in informal work. Different occupations also display different patterns of in-
formal work behavior. This suggests that regular work opens doors to informal work
opportunities.
Future work should examine this process in greater detail: To what extent do workers exit
the regular sector to pursue new informal opportunities versus using the informal sector
to cushion the loss of regular-sector employment? Do workers choose their regular-sector
occupation in order to work in both sectors? How does informal work affect well-being? If
informal work spells end because workers have earned enough to cushion themselves from
shocks in regular-sector income, then informal work can effectively supplement family
welfare. On the other hand, informal work may decrease well-being if the spells end
because of failed businesses or exhaustion on the part of workers engaged in both formal
and informal work.
The Fragile Families data indicate that urban parents of children born between 1998 and
2000 earned $2.2 billion (2011 $) annually in informal work during the survey period.
If other adults are equally likely to work informally, this yields a back-of-the-envelope
calculation that indicates that total informal earnings in the United States among working-
age adults were approximately $50 billion annually between 1997 and 2005. This is less than
half a percent of GDP, far below the estimated 7­10 percent of GDP that indirect techniques
suggest as the size of the informal economy (see, for example, Schneider, 2005), although
international statistical agencies generally view these estimates as overstated (European
Commission, 2007). Despite the difference, the magnitude of unreported earnings in the
Fragile Families data is still large enough to have serious policy implications. The foregone
payroll taxes on these earnings were $7.6 billion each year, about 1 percent of payroll tax
receipts. Total informal earnings exceeded annual federal spending on each of the Earned
Income Tax Credit, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program during the survey period. Better understanding the effect of
informal work on household well-being is important for guiding policy and determining
whether efforts should concentrate on formalizing informal work or strengthening regular-
sector opportunities.
