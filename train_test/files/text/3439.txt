Introduction
Over the past 10 years, Australia has been the setting for
an increasing number of marine renewable energy devel-
opments, with several new developments reaching ocean
trials in the last 5 years. Concepts for extracting power
from the seas are not new, with energy having been
extracted from tidal mills since at least the 6th century
(Murphy, 2006), the first wave-power patent filed in
France in 1799 (Falcão, 2010) and the first trial occurring
inAustralia in 1909 (Hemer and Griffith, 2011). However,
the 21st century has seen significant government invest-
ment added to what has hitherto been largely private
venture capital­funded developments. Most notably, the
establishment of the Australian Renewable Energy
Agency (ARENA) by the Australian Federal Government
in 2012, plus significant support from some of the State
Governments, has accelerated development as well as
research. In a major review and analysis, the status and
economic potential of Australian marine renewable
energy was reviewed by Behrens et al. (2012a); they
covered preliminary-level assessments of the available
resource, including wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-
current energy and ocean-thermal energy conversion
(OTEC). Major examples of technologies developed
overseas were reviewed, and an up-to-date survey of all
marine renewable energy developments in Australia at
the time was presented. Environmental and multiple-
use issues associated with Australia's marine domain
were also canvassed. In a study specific to wave power,
Behrens et al. (2012b) also combined an assessment of
the wave resource with models of generic classes of

Abstract
The history of ocean renewable energy developments in Australia is reviewed. A layperson's description of the physical
operating principle is given for the main classes of technology that have been tested in Australian waters. The Australian
marine domain possesses among the world's most energetic wave-energy resources, driven by powerful mid-latitude
westerly winds. The northern coast of Western Australia has tidal ranges significant on a global scale, and some
geographical features around the continent have local tidal resonances. The East Australian Current, one of the world's
major western boundary currents, runs along the eastern Australian seaboard, offering potential for ocean-current
energy. Sea-water temperatures in the tropical north-east of Australia may permit ocean thermal energy conversion.
While this abundance of resources makes Australia an ideal location for technology development, the population is
highly concentrated in a few large cities, and transmission infrastructure has developed over a century to supply cities
from traditional power plants. Several wave-power developments have resulted in demonstration of deployments in
Australian waters, three of which have been grid connected. Trials of tidal devices have also occurred, while other
classes of ocean renewable energy have not yet been trialled. The prospects for marine renewable energy in Australia
are discussed including non-traditional applications such as coastal protection and energy export.

ocean wave-energy converters (WECs) to predict the lev-
elised cost of electricity around Australia. Hemer et al.
(2016) updated the wave resource assessment.
The fundamental differences between wave energy,
tidal energy, ocean-current energy and OTEC are detailed
in a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). Wave
energy is fundamentally a concentrated and averaged form
of wind energy, generated by winds blowing over the
World's ocean basins, and hence, wave energy is large in
oceans subjected to strong, steady winds. Winds are cre-
ated by differences in the sun's heat between the tropics
and poles. Ocean-current energy is also due to the action of
the winds, modified by the earth's rotation. Meanwhile,
ocean-thermal energy is more directly due to solar heating
of the sea surface. All the above-mentioned forms of ocean
renewable energy thus derive ultimately from the sun's
heat. In contrast, tidal energy is due to the gravity of celes-
tial bodies, mostly the moon, and varies geographically
due to the size and shape of continents, bays and inlets.
Compared with better-known forms of renewable
energy such as wind and solar power, marine renewable
energy demonstrates great diversity, complexity and, once
installed in the water, the operating principles are largely
invisible to the layperson. There has been no clear, detailed
description of the operating principles of the marine
renewable energy technologies used in Australia (and
indeed no such description anywhere, to the best of our
knowledge) that would be comprehensible to a lay reader-
ship. For example, it is not unusual to hear laypersons con-
fusing wave and tidal power, despite their operating
principles being vastly different and their geographic and
economic opportunities being complementary rather than
competitive. Thus, there is a need to review Australian
developments in the context of the resource they tap and
the specific principle they exploit.
The aim of this review is to describe in detail develop-
ments since the last review in 2012. We aim at a lay reader-
ship and include explanations of the operating principles
such that the success, failure or potential of each develop-
ment can be judged from an informed perspective.
However, we do not review all proposed or trialled tech-
nologies, focusing on a selection that is representative of
the major classes of device that have been trialled in the
ocean. We also speculate on the prospects for the technolo-
gies and on the true advantages Australia may offer in this
area of renewable energy. Examples of levelised costs
of electricity for some resources are given in Table 5
(section `Engineering and economic efficiencies') of a
companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017), which focuses
on the integration of marine renewable energy with the
needs of coastal communities and includes a detailed sys-
tem for decision-making on appropriate technologies.
The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In
section `Geographical and climatic factors', we discuss the
geographic and climatic factors that determine the marine
renewable energy resource in Australia. The resources and
technologies related to wave energy, along with an histori-
cal account of device deployments in Australia, are
reviewed in section `Australian wave energy', while those
related to tidal energy are discussed in section `Australian
tidal energy'. Ocean-current power and OTEC are dis-
cussed briefly in section `Other marine renewables', while
a concluding discussion is presented in section `Discussion
and conclusion'.
Geographical and climatic factors
Australia's 34,000 km of coastline extends from a tropical
climate in the north through a subtropical to a mid-latitude
climate in the south (McInnes et al., 2016). Thus, the
coastline north of approximately 20°S (Figure 1) experi-
ences a wet monsoon season with winds mainly from the
north-west from about October to March and a dry season
where south-east trade winds prevail from about April to
September. The seasons in the south of the continent are
influenced by the movement of the subtropical ridge, a
zone of atmospheric high pressure which delineates the
trade easterly winds to its north and the mid-latitude west-
erlies to its south. The subtropical ridge reaches its maxi-
mum northward extent at around 30°S during the summer
months (December to February) and around 40°S during
the winter months (June to August) (McInnes et al., 2016).
South of the subtropical ridge, mid-latitude low-pressure
systems and their associated fronts bring powerful

westerly to south-westerly winds and associated wave cli-
mate to the region.
Due to Australia's arid interior, approximately 80% of
the population of 23 million people live at or near the
coast. The majority (approximately 80%) of the total
population live along the eastern and south-eastern sea-
board from Queensland to South Australia including
Tasmania (Figure 1). This is reflected in the connectivity
of Australia's electricity grid in the east of the continent
as compared to the west (Figure 1).
Australia's vast coastline gives rise to a large potential
marine-energy resource. In particular, its extensive
Southern Ocean exposure means it has one of the richest
wave-energy resources of any country (Lewis et al.,
2011). The nature of the marine-energy resource in a
given location is influenced by attributes such as conti-
nental shelf width, bathymetric depth and coastline orien-
tation in relation to prevailing weather conditions. For
example, large tidal amplitudes coincide with relatively
wide and shallow continental shelf regions where bottom
friction amplifies the maximum water levels. The north-
west shelf of Australia has the largest tidal range in the
country with a maximum tidal range at King Sound
(Figure 1 and Table 1) of up to 11.8 m. A large tidal range
of around 5 m also occurs on the Queensland coast
between 20 and 24°S (Behrens et al., 2012a). Conversely,
the wave-energy resource near to shore on the north-west
shelf and Northern Territory is limited (Hemer et al.,
2016). This is in part due to coral reefs, found along these
coastlines, which enhance wave dissipation offshore
(McInnes et al., 2016).
Australia's east coast also features a major southward
flowing boundary current ­ The East Australian Current
(EAC) ­ which is the western extent of the South Pacific
tropical gyre circulation. A comprehensive assessment of
the resource potential of the EAC has not been undertaken
(Behrens et al., 2012a); however, Griffin and Hemer
(2010) indicate that this resource (of order tens of ter-
awatt-hours/year) is probably much less than Australia's
electricity needs. Ocean thermal and salinity gradients
also offer a potential marine-energy resource in Australian
waters. Although detailed assessments of this resource
have not been made yet, Behrens et al. (2012a) identified
that the most promising Australian OTEC sites are
located at distances of >100 km off the North Queensland
coast.
Australian wave energy
Resources
Based on a comprehensive assessment of wave-energy
resource inAustralia, Hemer et al. (2016) estimate the total
wave-energy flux across the depths of 25, 50 and 200 m to
be 1796, 2652 and 2730 TW h/year, respectively. This
available energy is an order of magnitude larger than the
248 TW h electricity generated in Australia in 2013­2014
(Department of Industry and Science, 2015), confirming
the magnitude of the wave resource is not a constraint to its
future uptake. The vast majority of this resource is availa-
ble to the southern coastal region with 1455 TW h/year
estimated at the 25 m-deep contour from 29°S on the
Western Australian coast to 148°E on the southern tip of
Tasmania including western Victoria. By contrast, the
wave-energy resource over northern Western Australia
(north of 23.5°S) and Northern Territory at the 25 m con-
tour is only 61 TW h/year.
Wave variability is also an important consideration for
wave-energy extraction. At the 25 m isobath (the depth
around which many wave devices are presently being
tested), much of the southern, mid-latitude coastal region
is also favourable because it displays relatively low varia-
bility in wave energy with respect to the total available
wave energy. Large waves are generally not much greater
than the wave height at which most energy is received, and
episodes of minimum wave heights and energy (signifi-
cant wave height, Hs, of <1 m) are relatively short-lived
(durations typically <1 day) and relatively uncommon
(typically >100 days between events). Conversely, in the
tropical north, the lower available wave resource is also
characterised by a larger ratio of large waves to mean wave
height due to the occurrence of tropical cyclones. This
region also experiences periods of minimal wave energy
that are more frequent and of longer duration (Hemer
et al., 2016).
Reasons for the diversity of WEC designs
Fundamental factors of physics and engineering have led
to the development of a great diversity of WEC designs
worldwide. Significant research and development began in
the 1970s (Salter, 1974) and accelerated in the late 20th
century (Falcão, 2010). In the present day, there are over
250 wave-energy companies (The European Marine
Energy Centre, 2016), mostly with technologically distinct
devices. On first glance, many of these devices appear
totally different. The facile conclusion would be that the
ideal technology has not yet emerged, and that investors
and governments should wait for clarity before serious
investment. However, this conclusion would be incorrect
since, as explained in Manasseh et al. (2017), there is much
greater similarity than first appears. Most, though not all,
WECs are designed to have a natural frequency with which
they will oscillate if disturbed from a state of rest. This
natural frequency is designed by the engineer to match the
frequency of the prevailing ocean waves; when the fre-
quencies match, resonance occurs, corresponding to a
large motion of the machine relative to the water and con-
sequently a large extraction of power from ocean waves
(Manasseh et al., 2017). The enormous advantage of

resonance is that the WEC is able to remove power from
waves over an area of ocean larger than the machine's
physical size. The maximum theoretical length of wave

where  is the wavelength of the ocean waves (the length
from crest to crest). However, there are very many types of
mechanisms that have a natural frequency. Indeed, all the
Australian WECs that have been ocean-tested, apart from
one (see section `Non-resonating developments'), are res-
onators. The reason for the diversity in WEC designs is the
unfortunate ­ and interesting ­ combination of two very
simple issues, as detailed below.
First, the simplest way to generate electricity is by
mechanically rotating a shaft in one direction only. Once
there is a rotating shaft, via gears and an electrical machine,
electricity can be generated, transmitted and sold.
However, the physics of wave action dictates that the
motive fluid, water, is inherently reciprocating: The water
reverses its motion every cycle, going in one direction on
the wave crest and the opposite direction on the trough.
Thus, the momentum available for conversion into torque
and useful power is constantly changing from positive to
negative, no matter which direction one chooses. Contrast
this with the water exiting a dam, which flows solely
down-hill, or with the wind, which is air flowing solely
from atmospheric high- to low-pressure systems; in these
cases, the motive fluid flows in one direction.
If the motive fluid, be it air or water, is moving in one
direction, or even mostly in one direction, the technol-
ogy necessary to extract useful power from this unidirec-
tional flow is simple. All that is required is a single
moving part, the turbine. A turbine is a rotating shaft
with fixed blades attached to it. Whether in the form of a
medieval water wheel or modern hydroelectric turbine,
an ancient windmill or modern wind turbine, the concept
is the same: a rotating shaft, with blades fixed to it.
However, for reciprocating motion such as that due to
waves, an efficient transformation to rotating-shaft
motion is not possible with a single moving part. For
example, the efficient reciprocating-to-rotary transfor-
mation inside the classical internal combustion engine
requires three parts: the piston, the crank and the crank-
shaft, connected by two joints and a sliding interface.
Meanwhile, the cup anemometer is an example of
single-moving-part mechanism that turns in one direc-
tion irrespective of the direction of airflow; it is fine for
measuring the speed of wind flow but very inefficient if
one tried to extract useful power from it.
The second issue is that machines in the ocean must be
engineered to minimise the number of moving joints in the
water. The tripartite mechanism of the internal combustion
engine functions perfectly in a sealed, lubricated housing.
In the ocean, however, biofouling, sediments and salt
water make joints problematic. Moreover, for reasons
explained in section `Pitching developments', the machines
must be very large, implying very large forces are applied
to large joints subjected to biofouling, sediment ingress
and saline attack.
While some WECs have been designed to generate
electricity directly from a reversing linear motion, this
entails its own issues of electrical engineering. Thus, the
majority of WEC designs achieve some form of recipro-
cating-to-rotary transformation. There are very many ways
of doing this, and due to the concomitant need to minimise
underwater joints and sliders, none of the designs is per-
fect. Consequently, WEC design is an appealing challenge
for inventors. Moreover, mechanical devices can be con-
ceived without a formal engineering education, and thus,
more WECs are being invented every year. Some can be
shown by a back-of-the-envelope calculation to be unreal-
istic, but many others are genuinely innovative concepts
not readily disproven.
Furthermore, the ease with which new inventions can
be created means that many new patents can be filed.
This, in turn, makes many small start-up companies
possible, each based on unique intellectual property (IP).
Despite the relative ease of filing IP, the ability of a com-
pany to demonstrate its idea is dependent on being able to
attract significant amounts of capital.
This diversity means that even the task of classifying
WECs is not simple. Classifications are discussed in detail
in a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). For the
purposes of this article, it is sufficient to note thatAustralian
WEC designs have covered many WEC types, possibly
due to the ease of patenting inherent to WEC concepts
rather to an intent to match the WEC type to the applica-
tion. The operating-principle classification proposed in
Manasseh et al. (2017) is adopted.
Technologies
Liquid-pendulum (oscillating water column) developments.The
oscillating water column (OWC) was the first concept for
extracting power from ocean waves to be implemented in
practice and has led to the longest-surviving installations
(Falcão, 2010; Heath, 2012). It is also the first WEC con-
cept to be implemented in Australia. The survivability of
the OWC can be understood once its operating principle is
appreciated. In its most elementary form, it is simply a
tube open at both ends, with its top in the air and immersed
in water by a length L. It is easy to show that its natural
frequency f0
(s-1) is given by
f
L
0
1
2
=

g
, (2)
Manasseh et al. 55
where g is the acceleration due to gravity (Figure 2(a)).
This is the equation of a pendulum of length L; hence, it is
a natural oscillator. Indeed, it is possible to observe one or
two natural oscillation cycles using a large drinking straw
dipped at depth L into a glass of water, sucking up a column
of water and then letting the water fall back into the glass.
Like any natural oscillator, it will resonate when driven by
frequencies close to f0
. Thus, L is `tuned' during the
machine's design to match the prevailing frequency of
ocean waves where the machine is to operate (Manasseh
et al., 2017). There are no moving parts in the water, a
major contributor to the simplicity and survivability of the
OWC concept. However, the need to transform oscillatory
motion into rotary motion, as noted in section `Reasons for
the diversity of WEC designs', is nonetheless still an issue.
To generate electricity, most OWC designs use a bi-direc-
tional turbine mounted the air above the water column. The
turbine rotates in the same direction irrespective of the
direction of airflow alternately pushed and pulled by the
water surface. The bi-directional turbine may be of a type
with fixed blades, which is inevitably less effective than
conventional unidirectional turbines. Alternatively, it may
be a turbine whose blades can be rotated to vary their pitch,
which introduces very many moving parts, albeit only in
the air (Falcão, 2010).
A `back-of-the-envelope' calculation using equation (2)
immediately explains the issue mentioned in section
`Reasons for the diversity of WEC designs': The machines
must be very large. Ocean swell, which contains the highest
energy, has a low frequency. On the coasts of Australia
exposed to Southern Ocean swell, this frequency is typi-
cally below 0 1 1
. s- (Behrens et al., 2012b). To match even
the 0 1 1
. s- value requires a length L of about 25 m, The
`pendulum' must be the height of an eight-storey building.

and (b), the natural oscillating frequency is given by equation (2), and in (c), the natural oscillating frequency is given by equation (3).
56 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)
A further advantage of the OWC, partially mitigating
the need for installation in great depth, is that its theoreti-
cal natural frequency given by equation (2) is maintained
irrespective of the geometry of the underwater part of the
`tube'. As long as there is a total length L of enclosed duct,
chamber or pipe, this length can theoretically be any shape
at all, not simply a tube pointing straight down. Indeed,
many OWC designs have a `bent duct', such that the length
L is literally L-shaped, with the base of the `L' horizontal
and thus water flowing horizontally into and out of the
underwater opening. This means the device can be situated
in water that is shallower than L, opening up a wider range
of sites. The larger the diameter (width) of the duct, the
greater the power that may be extracted; power in the order
of 1 MW requires a width approaching 10 m or more.
Furthermore, the pressure exerted by passing waves can
vary with depth, which has consequences for the design of
all WECs. Classical theory due to Airy in 1841 (e.g. Gill,
1982) shows that in `deep' water, defined as deeper than
about 1/2 of the wavelength, the pressure and velocity
decrease exponentially with depth. The wavelength can be
over 100 m on the Southern Ocean and southern Indian
Ocean coasts of Australia (Behrens et al., 2012b). In `shal-
low' water, defined as water shallower than 1/20 of the
wavelength, the pressure and velocity (the `wave action')
are invariant with depth. Water depths between 1/2 and
1/20 of the wavelength are called intermediate, and the
wave motion decreases with depth, though not as rapidly
as in deep water. Thus, in all but shallow-water regimes,
having a bent duct enables the entrance to the duct to be
closer to the surface and to be subjected to a greater forc-
ing, permitting greater energy extraction from waves.
Nonetheless, to benefit from the maximum in wave motion
at the surface, the required water column length would
have to be shaped into a `U', not a `L', and indeed,
U-shaped OWCs have been constructed overseas (Arena
et al., 2013). It is also worth noting that at every bend in
the water column, energy is lost to vortices formed at the
bends (Fleming et al., 2012) and thus is unavailable for
electricity generation.
The first OWCs were installed in the 19th century off
the US East coast, not to generate electricity but to power
navigation-warning whistles, and there were 34 such
OWCs operating by 1885 (Heath, 2012). Electricity-
generating OWCs were developed in 1910, when
Mr Bochaix-Praceique supplied his house with 1 kW
of electricity using an OWC concept (Palme, 1920).
Several further examples were installed in Japan, Europe
and India over the 20th century (Falcão, 2010; Heath,
2012). A 150 kW OWC was installed at Vizhinjam,
Kerala, India, in 1990 (Manasseh et al., 2017; Sundar
et al., 2010); it was grid connected and operated for about
20 years while subjected to several improvements.
The grid-connected 500 kW LIMPET OWC at Islay,
Scotland, United Kingdom, commenced operations in
2000, following a grid-connected trial of a smaller machine
that lasted 9 years (Heath, 2012). The LIMPET plant was
closed in 2013 following a strategic-direction change by
the operating company (US Department of Energy, 2016).
Significantly, the long-lived installations in India and the
United Kingdom were shore mounted and thus unsinkable
and easily accessible for maintenance.
The first Australian OWC developments were made by
the company Energetech, founded in 1997 in Sydney by
Tom Denniss; it changed its name to Oceanlinx (2016) in
2007. It was initially funded by venture capital and eventu-
ally by Australian government grants. The company's first
installation, denoted MK1, was a bent-duct OWC that sat
on the seabed in shallow water at Port Kembla, New South
Wales. It should be noted that on the eastern coast of
Australia, unlike the southern coast, peak wave frequen-
cies are generally higher, between 0.1 and 0 2 1
. s- , so that,
recalling equation (2), machines can be smaller; for f0
=
0.2 s-1, the length L is about 6 m, the height of a two-storey
building, and for f0
= 0.15 s-1, L is about 11 m. This con-
trasts with the 25 m or more needed for the Southern
Ocean. Thus, pendulum-type machines on the Australian
East Coast may resonate with lengths between about 6
and 25 m, depending on the actual local wave climate.
However, by exploiting the bent-duct principle, the
Energetech machine did not need to be in water greater
than, say, 11 m deep. Thus, it could be constructed and
deployed close to shore (Denniss, 2006). In 2007, the
device was redeveloped into a further prototype, denoted
MK2, with a nominal generation capacity of 1 MW. The
system included a parabolic underwater wall intended to
focus waves towards the water column (Carley and
Denniss, 2000) and was also intended to produce desali-
nated water (Denniss, 2006).
A larger, grid-connected, machine, the MK3, was
installed at Port Kembla in March 2010. Similar to some of
the earliest OWC designs, the MK3 was designed to float
and was moored to the seabed. It was designed to house a
number of OWCs on a common platform, giving a total
generation capacity of 2.5 MW and operated successfully
(Oceanlinx, 2016). However, it was wrecked in May 2010
when it broke its moorings in rough seas (Hasham, 2010).
The Port Kembla machines were of steel construction.
Oceanlinx received funding from ARENA (2014),
permitting design and construction of a further prototype,
`GreenWave'. By this stage, the company's key IP
appeared to be the design of its bi-directional turbine
(Carley and Denniss, 2000), although the internal structure
of the ducting had also been subjected to significant
research (Fleming et al., 2012). This machine's structure
was made of concrete and intended to sit on the seabed. A
single turbine was rated at 1 MW. It was constructed in
Port Adelaide, South Australia (Figure 3), where there is a
submersible construction facility capable of handling
the 3000 t structure. The intended location was Port
Manasseh et al. 57
MacDonnell, South Australia, approximately 450 km
south-east of Adelaide.
In March 2014, the concrete machine was successfully
rendered buoyant with air bags and towing to Port
MacDonnell commenced. However, rough seas damaged
the air bags during the tow (Australian Broadcasting
Corporation, 2014), and it was damaged beyond repair
(England, 2014). Thus, the firm was unable to meet con-
tractual obligations imposed by investors and went into
liquidation (England, 2014). However, the IP was trans-
ferred to a new corporate structure, and the company has
emerged as a Hong Kong-based concern with plans to
deploy OWC technology in Taiwan (Oceanlinx, 2016).
These Australian developments remain the most ambi-
tious developments of the OWC concept to date. They
went beyond the secure, shore-based OWCs or the tempo-
rary trials of floating OWCs undertaken previously.
Machines were deployed that were the outcome of a long
series of incremental trials and re-developments.
In general, due to the lack of moving parts in the water
and thus easy integration into a wall, OWCs that are bot-
tom mounted are well suited to protection of the coast
from waves, an application that has been implemented in
Europe (e.g. Arena et al., 2013; Torre-Enciso et al., 2010)
but has not yet been planned in Australia. Coastal protec-
tion is discussed in section `Discussion and conclusion'
and in Manasseh et al. (2017).
A new OWC concept, the `Wave Mill', was tested at the
Gold Coast, Queensland (Voropaev, 2016). This concept
(Figure 4) realises an ingenious idea to avoid the need for
a bi-directional turbine. A row of OWCs is arranged at
right angles to the incoming wave crests. The row is at
least as long as a wavelength of the incoming swell. When
air is pushed out of each OWC, it passes through a one-
way valve which is a simple flexible plate hinged at the
top, rather like a `cat flap'; the air exhausts into a common
exhaust plenum chamber running parallel to the row. Air is
sucked in from a one-way valve on the opposite side of
each OWC, coming from a common inlet plenum cham-
ber. Because the row of OWCs is longer than a wavelength,
one OWC is always maximally exhausting air and another
is maximally intaking air at any given time. The exhaust
and inlet chambers communicate via a turbine that thus
turns in one direction only. Moreover, the turbine turns at
a steady speed as long as the incoming swell is steady and
not changing in amplitude along the row. In contrast, the
bi-directional turbines of other OWC concepts are con-
stantly speeding up and slowing down, with maximum
speeds on the crest and trough. While one-way valves are
used to rectify oscillatory flow to unidirectional flow in a
few other OWC designs (Heath, 2012), the Wave Mill
appears to be the only concept that could achieve a con-
stant turbine speed, at least for incoming waves that do not
vary from wave to wave. One possible drawback is the
power lost as the air passes through the valve; as noted
below, this issue inevitably affects several technologies
that have been deployed.
Mechanical-pendulum developments.
While the OWC's
operating principle can be simplified to that of a liquid
pendulum, a rigid mechanical pendulum inherently oper-
ates with a natural frequency given by the pendulum equa-
tion (2), as illustrated in Figure 2(b). Several concepts
have been developed and installed around the world (e.g.
Henry et al., 2014), taking the form of underwater flaps or
cylinders hinged at the bottom. The advantage of a bottom-
hinged pendulum is that its maximum motion is close to
the surface, where (as noted in section `Reasons for the
diversity of WEC designs') the velocity and pressure
induced by waves are also maximum, permitting efficient
transfer of energy to the motion of the machine. This offers
an advantage over the bent-duct OWC, which has an
entrance below the surface. Since the length of the pendu-
lum is determined by equation (2), and, unlike the OWC,
the length L must be straight, a mechanical-pendulum
WEC must be deployed in water no shallower than L. Fur-
thermore, as just noted, the maximum in wave action is at
the surface; to take advantage of this, the water in which it

duct OWC, showing the turbine, under construction in Port

is deployed should not be much deeper than L. Therefore,
there are more constraints on the siting of mechanical
pendulums.
A machine called `BioWAVE' (Finnigan and Caska,
2006) was developed by BioPower Systems (BPS, 2016a),
a company founded by Tim Finnigan in Sydney in 2006
(Figure 5(a)). While this machine is described in this sec-
tion as a mechanical pendulum, it has elements of the
heaving buoy described in section `Heaving-buoy devel-
opments'. The machine consists of three cylindrical cham-
bers, arranged rather like the tines of a fork, which branch
from a stem hinged at the bottom. The design in the form
of parallel cylinders with gaps between them, rather than
the continuous solid flaps of similar mechanical pendulum
trialled elsewhere, was thought to create beneficial interac-
tions between the cylinders. Each cylinder was thought to
act as an individual device in an array (Caska and Finnigan,
2007); it is known that array interactions of devices can
increase device output due to surface-wave radiative cou-
pling (Budal, 1977; De Chowdhury et al., 2015). Although
it is not stated by the authors representing BPS, it is also
possible that the design may allow it to benefit from an
additional resonance due to vortex-induced vibration
(VIV; Gabbai and Benaroya, 2005).
Each cylinder is a buoyant chamber. The buoyancy can
be altered by flooding or purging the chambers as needed,
improving performance (Flocard and Finnigan, 2010,
2012); this effectively changes L by shifting the centre of
buoyancy. If necessary, by flooding the chambers, the pen-
dulum can be temporarily `sunk', laying it horizontally on
the seabed to avoid storm damage.
As with all WECs, the issue of transforming the recip-
rocating motion into rotary motion needs to be addressed.
The BPS machine achieves this with hydraulic cylinders
that pressurise hydraulic fluid on both forward and back-
ward strokes via one-way valves. The high-pressure fluid
is accumulated on-board and released to drive a conven-
tional unidirectional generator. The on-board hydraulic
accumulators and generator are promoted as a separate
technology under the name `O-drive'. As in any system
involving valves, energy will be lost as fluid passes through
the valves.
The hydraulic fluid could also provide some stiffness
restoring the pendulum to the vertical. This stiffness, plus
the variable-buoyancy spars (Flocard and Finnigan, 2012),
offers the opportunity to `tune'the natural frequency of the
machine differently to the simple prediction of equation
(2). Nonetheless, the length of the pendulum chosen by
BPS of about 26 m is well predicted by equation (2) for the
Southern Ocean site it is intended for ( f0

. s gives
L 25 m). Recalling the definitions of `shallow', `interme-
diate' and `deep' water from section `Liquid-pendulum
(oscillating water column) developments', and noting that
values of the wavelength at this location would be roughly
100­200 m, the machine is located in intermediate-depth
water, where wave action does decrease with depth. These
combinations of four different concepts, pendulum, float-
on-spring, array interactions and VIV, albeit with the
mechanical-pendulum concept dominant, make it one of
the most conceptually sophisticated WECs yet deployed
anywhere in the world.
The 250 kW BPS machine was funded in part by the
ARENA (2016a) and was successfully deployed in
December 2015, in the Southern Ocean just west of the
town of Port Fairy, Victoria (BPS, 2016b). It was con-
structed in a shipyard in Vietnam, where all final fit-out
was completed and transported to site by a heavy-lift ship
(Figure 5(b)), precluding the need for a towing operation.
Its grid connection is via a local aquaculture business.
The deployment process damaged the prior-laid cable to
shore, requiring a new cable that is being installed at the
time of writing.
Heaving-buoy developments.The heaving-buoy concept is
another natural oscillator, similar to the pendulum con-
cepts, the OWC and the mechanical pendulum.Abuoy that
is held entirely underwater or allowed to pierce the surface
like a ship provides an upward buoyancy force. According
to Archimedes' principle, this force is equal to the weight
of displaced seawater minus the weight of the shell of the
buoy and any attached objects. The buoy is tethered to the

seabed by a cable, or in one concept trialled in Australia,
held from the top by a link connected to an independent
frame. The cable must be connected to a moving part, such
as a hydraulic cylinder or pinion that either directly or
indirectly transduces the reciprocating motion to rotary
motion to generate electricity. Furthermore, whatever sys-
tem the cable or link connects to must possess appropriate
stiffness, so that there is a restoring force returning the
buoy to equilibrium after a wave displaces it; a mechanical
spring is the simplest example of a restoring-force system.
The natural frequency of the most elementary example of
a completely submerged heaving buoy can be written as
f
k
m
0
1
2
=

, (3)
where k is the `stiffness' of the restoring-force system and
m is the net mass (inertia) of displaced seawater (Figure
2(c)). The inertia m depends essentially on the size of the
buoy and is reduced by any pre-tension in the restoring-
force system. The power delivered increases with the stiff-
ness, among other factors. It is clear by comparing
equations (2) and (3) that the heaving-buoy concept offers
more opportunities for design than the pure-pendulum
concepts. Both m and k can be designed by the engineer
such that f0
has the target value determined by the pre-
vailing wave climate at the location chosen, whereas for
pendulum concepts, L is pre-determined once the target
value of f0
is determined. Nonetheless, simple estimates
show that if the buoy is made conveniently small, say only
a few metres in diameter, the stiffness would need to be so
low that the power delivered by a single unit would be
uneconomically low. Thus, the outcome is the same as
with the pendulum: The machines need to be large, 10­20
m in diameter. Alternatively, if the units are to be small, a
very large number of units need to be installed in an array
in order to generate economically significant amounts of
power.
If the buoy is allowed to pierce the surface, the expres-
sion for f0
becomes more complex since the buoy would
have a natural frequency due to gravity with which it
`bobs' vertically, modified by the spring stiffness.
Furthermore, if the spring is removed entirely from a sur-
face-piercing buoy, its natural frequency is again given by
the `pendulum'relation (2), where L is now the submerged
draught of the buoy. Again, the same conclusion is
obtained: The machine must be large.
As noted in earlier sections, devices near to or piercing
the surface generally benefit from the maximum in wave
action at the surface. However, this exposes them to a
greater risk of damage from storms, unless their buoyancy
can be temporarily negated to `sink'them to the bottom for
safety, as with the BPS machine described in section
`Mechanical-pendulum developments'.
Carnegie Wave Energy (CWE) (2015), based in
Fremantle, Western Australia, began testing a heaving-
buoy concept in 1999 (Figure 2(c)). The company's origi-
nal capital base was derived from the Western Australian
mining industry, and it is listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange (ASX), enabling capital raising from share-
market investors. The company's first design, denoted
CETO1, was subjected to trials in 2006. The CETO con-
cept is a spherical or spheroidal float, with the most recent
designs constructed of steel.
The last-tested CWE design, CETO5 (detailed in Fievez
and Sawyer, 2015), was funded in part by ARENA
(CWE, 2015). It was tethered to the seabed by a cable, and
mounted at the seabed joint was a hydraulic cylinder.
Hydraulic fluid is pressurised on the upstroke as the buoy
rises, flowing via a one-way valve into a pipeline to shore.
As for the other technologies noted above employing
valves, energy will be lost as fluid passes through the
valves. The high-pressure fluid was stored in accumulator
tanks from which it could be released to drive a conven-
tional unidirectional hydraulic generator, which was grid
connected. Low-pressure fluid exhausted from the genera-
tor was returned to the offshore cylinder via a second pipe-
line and second one-way valve, where it still had sufficient
pressure to provide the restoring force returning the buoy
to its lowest displacement.
The hydraulic cylinder with its buoy can be attached to
and removed from a housing on the seabed, permitting
recovery and maintenance. The hydraulic fluid was origi-
nally planned to be seawater, thus enabling an alternative
use of the high-pressure water in a desalination facility;
however, the properties of seawater were not optimal for
the performance of the hydraulic system, so that desalina-
tion was delivered simply by sending the electricity gener-
ated to a conventional desalination plant. The buoy is 11 m
in diameter, and a single device had an estimated peak out-
put of 240 kW (CWE, 2015).
Three CETO5 units were built, and over 2015 progres-
sively deployed in the ocean off Garden Island, Western
Australia, about 40 km south of Perth (Figure 6(a)). The
buoys were manufactured in a shipyard in Vietnam and
transported to Perth for final fit-out, from which they could
be towed the short distance to site. This array performed as
planned, including a programmed removal and re-deploy-
ment of one of the units, demonstrating that routine main-
tenance was possible. At the end of the trial, all the units
were removed as planned. This trial represents one of the
longest-lived demonstrations of an array of WECs any-
where in the world (ARENA, 2016b).
The next machine in CWE's programme, CETO6
(Figure 6(b)), has an estimated power output of 1 MW and
is 22 m in diameter (CWE, 2015). Unlike its predecessor,
the hydraulic system and electrical machine generating
electricity will be inside the buoy, which like its predeces-
sors is constructed using shipbuilding techniques. The
60 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)
on-board hydraulic generator will make the machines
independent of onshore facilities (apart from a grid con-
nection) but will require the internal systems to be resilient
since access for maintenance will be infrequent.
Aquagen Technologies, a Melbourne-based start-up
company, tested a prototype heaving buoy in 2010 from
the pier at Lorne, Victoria (AquaGen Technologies,
2014). In this concept, the buoys are surface piercing,
and the cable is connected via an underwater pulley to a
generator on a platform above the water (Figure 7); in the
trial, the generator was on the pier. The buoy was 2.2 m
in diameter and generated 1.5 kW. The advantage is that
the only moving parts in the water are the cable and pul-
ley, with no electromechanical systems or control on-
board. The concept relies on a large array of small devices
to generate economically significant power. At the time
of writing, the company was seeking investment for fur-
ther development.
Waverider Energy, an Adelaide-based company, was
founded by Christian Gerlach. The company's technology
is an array of buoys held in a floating frame 111 m long, 13
m wide and 4 m high (McCaskill, 2014). Since there is a
rigid frame, the buoys can be held from the top, rather than
from below in other concepts. Since the frame is longer
than the shorter wavelengths of swell, there is a relative
movement between the frame and the buoys. The relative
movement of the buoys turns a shaft via a mechanism. A
machine rated at 500 kW was trialled in November 2011
off Adelaide (McCaskill, 2014). A clear advantage is that
the joints converting reciprocating to rotary motion are not
in the water, and thus a more complex and efficient mecha-
nism is possible, although the mechanism is still in the
saline-spray environment and potentially exposed to large
forces. The company states that a larger prototype with a
nominal 2 MW output is being developed (Waverider
Energy, 2015).
Protean Wave Energy, a Perth-based company, such as
CWE, benefitted from the capital accumulated from min-
ing in Western Australia. It is listed on the ASX. The
Protean concept was invented by Sean Moore in 2004
(Griffith, 2015). The buoy, which appears to be roughly
1.5 m in diameter (Figure 8), is surface piercing and con-
nected to a base on the seabed by multiple cables, which
the company states offer the potential to extract power
from >1 degree of freedom of motion (Proactive Investors,
2016). The cables turn pulleys inside the float which drive
a pneumatic compressor. A counterweight is located in
between the float and base; presumably, this provides a
gravitational restoring force in addition to, or alternatively

to, the stiffness of the compressed air. Since one-way
valves are likely to be employed in the pneumatics, there is
the potential for energy loss, just as with other technolo-
gies noted above using valves.
A single machine was trialled from a pier in Perth in
2015; analogously to the hydraulic-liquid transmission of
the much larger CWS CETO5 system, the compressed air
was piped onshore to turn a pneumatic generator. Similarly
to the AquaGen design, the Protean design is intended to be
installed in arrays, to overcome the issue of the very low­
power output of an individual small machine. Furthermore,
the small size affords economies of scale in manufactur-
ing, and the presence of multiple units would allow
redundancies permitting effective maintenance. An array
of 30 machines is under development at Bunbury, Western
Australia (Proactive Investors, 2016).
Pitching developments.To resonate a mechanical system
requires its natural frequency to be matched, as described
above. More generally, matching the natural frequency is
just a matching of the temporal frequency; there is also the
spatial frequency. Matching the spatial frequency requires
the length of a rigid part of the machine to be a quarter of
the wavelength, . The description of the resonators above
implicitly assumes that their length is much smaller than ,
so that spatial-frequency matching is not required. How-
ever, a machine of sufficient length could resonate by
matching its size to the wavelength as well as its natural
frequency to the wave frequency. This category of `pitch-
ing devices' (Falcão, 2010) operates at the surface where
wave action is maximal. There are usually joints between
rigid segments, and oscillation of the joints is converted
into useful power by a variety of mechanisms. A pitching
concept is being developed by Perpetuwave Power (2016;
Figure 9), which was founded in 2003 in Brisbane.
Non-resonating developments.Bombora Wave Power
(BWP, 2016a), a Perth-based start-up company, was
founded in 2011 by Shawn and Glen Ryan. Their concept,
unlike all other Australian WEC devices trialled to date,
does not rely on resonance. The underwater part of the
machine sits on the seabed and is made of a flexible mem-
brane divided into a number of cells (Figure 10). The cells
are inflated with compressed air, but the system is designed
to remain negatively buoyant and sit on the seabed. As
wave crests pass over, the resulting high pressure forces air
from cells through one-way valves into a plenum chamber,
from which the compressed air drives a conventional uni-
directional generator. Air exhausted from the generator
into a second plenum chamber is then sucked back into the
cells under the wave trough. As with the other concepts
requiring one-way valves, there will be energy losses as air
flows through the valves.
It is intended that the machine be composed of a large
number of cells arranged in a row. Similarly to the `Wave
Mill'concept (section `Liquid-pendulum (oscillating water
column) developments'), once the row of cells is longer
than a wavelength, there will always be air simultaneously
pushed out of some cells while being sucked into other
cells. This offers the advantage of a generator that not only
turns in the same direction but turns with a constant speed,

at least for incoming waves that do not vary from wave to
wave. In initial trials, the generator was onshore, but in
future designs, the generator is intended to be underwater,
with only a power cable connecting it to shore.
As noted earlier, wave motion and thus the pressure
imparted by passing waves decrease with depth. In deep
water, the pressure due to wave motion decreases expo-
nentially with depth, which would render a bottom-
mounted machine that does not reach the surface useless.
However, as noted in section `Reasons for the diversity
of WEC designs', in shallow water (such that the depth
is <1/20 of the wavelength), the pressure fluctuations
are virtually unchanged with depth (Gill, 1982). Thus,
the BWP device should function best in shallow water,
with a depth of 5­15 m (BWP, 2016b). This is consistent
with ocean swell having wavelengths of over 100 m,
which as noted in section `Reasons for the diversity of
WEC designs' does occur on the Southern Ocean and
southern Indian Ocean coasts of Australia (Behrens
et al., 2012b).
The BWP device is thus a form of artificial reef, and its
simplicity implies that it could be useful for coastal protec-
tion that assists in defraying its capital cost by profits from
the sale of electricity, as noted by Falcão (2010) and
Manasseh et al. (2017) and as discussed further in section
`Discussion and conclusion'.
The absence of resonance means that the machine will
not be able to draw in wave power over a region larger than
its physical size, as noted in section `Reasons for the diver-
sity of WEC designs'. Another way to express the absence
of resonance is to note that the displacement of the cells
will be the same as that of the water above them: There can
be no amplification. Nonetheless, there is nothing inherent
in the concept preventing it from being redeveloped into a
resonator in the future. A number of parameters are avail-
able, such as the stiffness provided by the compressed air
and the volume of air in accumulators, which may permit
tuning of a future version.
Australian tidal energy
Resources
Regions of high tidal amplitude or strong tidal currents are
most feasible for tidal-energy extraction. In the case of
regions with large tidal amplitude, it is the potential energy
that is exploited via structures such as tidal barrages. In
regions of strong tidal currents, it is the kinetic energy that
is exploited via free-stream turbines (Behrens et al., 2012a).
High tidal amplitudes occur in locations where the tide is
in resonance, which typically occurs when the natural
oscillation frequency of a semi-enclosed body of water
coincides with one of the astronomical forcing frequencies
(Behrens et al., 2012a). Although a detailed assessment of
Australia's tidal energy resource has not been undertaken
to date, Behrens et al. (2012a) note regions of greatest tidal
height to be the north-west shelf, Broad Sound in
Queensland and the northern coast of Tasmania. Regions
where tidal currents are large include, for example, the
eastern and western sides of Bass Strait, Torres Strait in
northern Queensland and Kings Sound on the north-west
shelf. This assessment was based on a coarse-resolution
tidal model. Given the complexity of tidal flows (e.g.
around headlands and in constricted passages), the esti-
mates provided by Behrens et al. (2012a) are likely to have
underestimated the available resource, and so further
high-resolution assessment of Australia's tidal resource
is required.
Technologies
In contrast to the complex diversity of fundamental con-
cepts observable in wave energy, tidal-energy technologies
are more readily understood. Unlike the reciprocating
flows of wave energy noted in section `Reasons for the
diversity of WEC designs', tidal flows, while they do
reverse, are unidirectional for 6 hours. This allows conven-
tional turbines to be used if the flow speed is high enough;
it is only necessary to pivot the turbine through on the
change from ebb to flow tides and back. Since most coasts
do not enjoy tidal flows fast enough to turn a turbine of
economic scale, variations in technologies centre on vari-
ous strategies to extract power from low-speed flows.
These are detailed in a companion article (Manasseh et al.,
2017); the most common is the ducted turbine, which
seeks to increase the speed passing through the turbine
with a converging duct. In locations where speeds are nat-
urally high enough, a free-bladed turbine is feasible.
Manasseh et al. (2017) also note that the tidal barrage con-
cept can capture all the tidal energy in a bay or inlet, by
simply constructing a barrier.
Atlantis Resources (AR, 2016) is a tidal-power devel-
oper originally founded in Brisbane. In 2002, AR tested its
first tidal-power technology at San Remo, Victoria. The
machine, called the `Aquanator', was a caterpillar-track-
like device with multiple blades able to operate irrespec-
tive of the flow direction (Figure 11). It was a unique
solution to the low-speed flow problem. It was grid-con-
nected and rated at 100 kW (AR, 2016). The narrow strait
between San Remo and Phillip Island is the eastern of two
entrances to Westernport Bay and has significant tidal
flows. The western entrance provides access for commer-
cial shipping to the port of Hastings, but the eastern
entrance does not have such traffic.
The company established operations in Singapore in
2006 `attracted by high quality R&D capabilities, as well
as the integrity of the intellectual property protection laws'
(AR, 2016). In 2008, the 150 kW, grid-connected AN150
machine, replaced the `Aquanator' machine at San Remo.
The San Remo site was decommissioned in 2015. Since
then, the company has developed more conventional
Manasseh et al. 63
ducted turbines and free-bladed turbines and has begun
planning projects in Scotland, Canada and China. Its latest
turbines are developed in collaboration with US multina-
tional engineering firm Lockheed-Martin.
The company listed on London stock exchange in 2014,
while retaining its headquarters in Singapore (Fiakas,
2016). The company has benefitted from significant finan-
cial support from the UK government. The commercial
400 MW MeyGen site at the northern tip of Scotland, the
world's largest tidal stream project, is nearing completion
(MeyGen Limited, 2016). This site has tidal flows of mak-
ing the conventional AR turbines most suitable for its
plans (Fiakas, 2016).
Elemental Energy Technologies (EET) is a Sydney-
based developer of tidal turbines, founded in 2007 by
Michael Urch. It tested its ducted turbine, the `Sea Urchin'
(Urch, 2013) at Newcastle, NSW, Australia, in 2011. The
machine was rated at 2 kW. Further tests occurred in
India, at the Defence Research and Development
Organisation. The device was manufactured under licence
from EET by Indian company Kirloskar Integrated
Technologies Limited in Pune, India. In 2012, Tenax
Energy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to
develop a 2 MW tidal-power plant in the Clarence Strait
between Darwin and Melville Island that would use EET
turbines. At the time of writing, the project has not yet
progressed. Meanwhile, EET was absorbed by another
company, Mako Turbines (2015), which is developing
another turbine, the `Mako'; this being a free-bladed tur-
bine. Many more Australian tidal-power trials have taken
place; these are summarised in Table 1.
Other marine renewables
Ocean-current power, as available from large-scale ocean-
ographic flows such as the major western boundary cur-
rents of the World's oceans, is described in Manasseh et al.
(2017). The most significant such resource for Australia is
the EAC, which flows along the coast of Queensland and
New South Wales. Griffin and Hemer (2010) note the EAC
flows as a fast narrow jet along the upper continental slope
between Fraser Island and northern NSW, at speeds in
excess of 2 m s-1 in the vicinity of the 1000 m-deep con-
tour. Beyond this stretch of coast, the EAC is an unstable
meandering flow best characterised as a series of swirling
eddies. Interest in the EAC as a source of energy is long-
standing, with interest extending back to at least the early
1980s (Thomson, 1980). However, Griffin and Hemer
(2010) note the low power density of these flows, thus
requiring very large­diameter devices to extract sufficient
power to make it a viable prospect. The total width of the
fast region of current is about 20 km, and thus, resource
availability is likely heavily constrained relative to
Australia's needs (Griffin and Hemer, 2010).
OTEC is described in Manasseh et al. (2017). It requires
a surface water temperature of at least 20°C, which is
found only in the tropics. Since a pipeline to depths
approaching 1000 m is also required, OTEC is most viable
where continental shelves are narrow or on isolated islands.
Such locations are found on the coast of far north
Queensland; Behrens et al. (2012a) noted potential sites
100 km off the North Queensland coast, 150 km North of
Cairns. Locations such distances offshore introduce eco-
nomic disincentives. There has been a suggestion of OTEC
development in this region (Ridd, 2005), but no developer
has yet come forward.
Salinity gradient energy conversion (SGEC) is detailed
by Kempener and Neumann (2014). In very simplistic
terms, it could be described as the reverse of desalination.
In desalination, energy is supplied to turn saline water into
freshwater. The reverse process releases energy as fresh-
water is allowed to dilute saline water. Effectively, this
energy was `stored' in the freshwater when the sun's heat
evaporated it to form rain. In the southern part ofAustralia,
there is sometimes a shortage of large quantities of fresh-
water, which has led to the construction of desalination
plants servicing major cities. Thus, SGEC may be more
useful in the tropical North, where large volumes of fresh-
water flow out to sea during the wet season. Behrens et al.
(2012a) also propose a combination of desalination and
SGEC as a form of energy storage.
Discussion and conclusion
Australia is endowed with every form of marine renewa-
ble energy resource: Wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-
current energy, ocean-thermal energy and salinity-gradient
energy are available. Due to its geographical location, the
continent has highly energetic wave resources in the south
and warm tropical seas suitable for OTEC in the north. A
huge region with high tidal range is present in the north-
west, and a major western boundary current runs along the
east coast. The United States is the only other national
jurisdiction possessing all classes of marine renewable
energy resource.
The majority of the population is concentrated in cities
on the coast, so that electricity infrastructure is distributed
coastally. However, there are great distances between
population centres, and the port facilities and workforce
able to construct, install, operate and maintain maritime

technologies are not necessarily within easy reach of
resource locations. As one example, Australia's most ener-
getic wave resources lie off the coast of SW Tasmania, a
wilderness area with almost no population centres. In
another example, the high tidal ranges of NW Western
Australia occur over a vast coastline that is virtually
unpopulated, and while the population that is there does
need energy, the absolute amount of energy needed locally
is very small. The remote nature of north-west Australia
has not been an issue for major petrochemical and mining
developments which have occurred in the same region.
However, those developments service enormous export
markets, not domestic markets, and are pursued by very
large, well-established corporations that are able to con-
struct entire towns to service their developments.
We note that the protection of the coast from waves is
of on-going relevance (Abanades et al., 2015), particularly
in the context of other alterations that might occur due to
climate change (Manasseh et al., 2017). The use of WEC
arrays for coastal protection, up to now constructed only in
Europe in the form of breakwaters that generate power
(Arena et al., 2013; Torre-Enciso et al., 2010), should be
considered in Australia. This has been proposed for the
Bombora device (Ryan et al., 2015). Unlike solid sea
walls, WEC arrays offer the ability of removing power
from waves without completely eliminating them.
Moreover, the power removed could be altered to suit the
circumstances of the day: `tuneable' coastal protection.
This may permit the reduction of some extremes without
necessarily inducing the environmental impacts of impen-
etrable infrastructure. Furthermore, it has already been
noted that significant reductions in the levelised cost of
electricity would occur if the imperative to protect the
coast provides a share of the cost of constructing the infra-
structure (Falcão, 2010). Correspondingly, the sale of elec-
tricity could offset the cost of servicing debt needed to
construct coastal-protection infrastructure.
The 2014 Oceanlinx incident illustrates some of the
issues facing WEC technology, some universal, some spe-
cific to Australia. The incident was nothing to do with the
technological concept; as noted, OWCs have been operat-
ing in the ocean for over 130 years and generating electric-
ity for over 60 years. A universal issue is the small scale of
firms developing concepts, which as noted in section
`Reasons for the diversity of WEC designs' is possible due
to the ease of developing unique IP, itself a fundamental
feature of the physics of waves and of engineering.
However, deploying large devices in an ocean environ-
ment that is, by definition, highly energetic, is usually the
preserve of large companies such as those in the petro-
chemicals industry. Such large companies have the capital
and resources to undertake risky operations over long time
frames, and to recover from setbacks; small firms do not.
The incident itself was due to a combination of the need
for a large device, in order to resonate at ocean wave
frequencies that are particularly low on the southern
Australian coast, and the long distances between port facil-
itiesanddeploymentsitestypicalofAustralia.Furthermore,
the small size of the company, itself a feature of the ease
with which IP can be created in wave power, may have
limited its deployment options.
The example of AR is also instructive. Once the com-
pany had successfully tested its technology in Australia, it
moved to Singapore and then listed in London. It has used
the Australian site to build expertise in tidal technology
testing and development but ceased operations in Australia
once appropriate business prospects emerged. It now con-
tracts out prime engineering design to a major multina-
tional engineering concern. It supplies equipment under
tender to government-supported power generation initia-
tives. The company's base is geographically closer to both
tidal sites on both sides of the NorthAtlantic and to sources
of capital to finance further operations. In practical terms,
it has ceased to be an Australian developer.
It is important to understand the principles underpin-
ning the Australian developments and understand these
principles in their geographical context. We have seen that
details such as the depth of the water and the frequency
and wavelength of the prevailing ocean swell may make
some wave-power technologies best for some locations,
while nominally competing technologies are best for other
locations. If the need to protect the coast is included, still
other wave-power technologies operating best in shallow
water may be more viable. Similarly, some tidal technolo-
gies may be viable in Australia's tropical North West,
where the great width of the continental shelf assists the
creation of high tides, while reducing the wave resource.
Where wave and tidal resources may be less viable, ocean-
current power may provide a marine renewable energy
option such as along the coasts of south-eastern Queensland
and northern New South Wales. OTEC may be a viable
option in the tropics.
In summary, Australia is an excellent testing ground for
all classes of marine renewable energy technologies. As
Australia, along with all other nations, seeks to decarbon-
ise its energy supplies, further development of its immense
marine renewable energy resources will occur. As noted in
section `Introduction', examples of levelised costs of elec-
tricity for wave, tidal and OTEC resources are given in
Table 5 (section `Engineering and economic efficiencies')
of a companion article (Manasseh et al., 2017). These
indicated that estimates of marine-renewable-energy lev-
elised costs of electricity in the year 2030 were still higher
than present-day wind costs. Moreover, the fairly small
national population means that technology-development
companies will struggle to grow to a viable size if they
focus solely on meeting local electricity demand. Coastal
protection is one aspect where wave-power technologies
in particular could rapidly reach economic viability, due to
the sharing of infrastructure costs, and a nation whose
Manasseh et al. 65
developers can master tuneable coastal protection may be
able to export expertise.
A paradigm for large growth may be export of marine
renewable energy. In 1974, Salter suggested that WECs
may be used to generate and store hydrogen. Whether or
not that particular suggestion is viable, export of fossil
fuels from Australia is presently a huge industry with its
infrastructure already focused on maritime export. James
(2011) suggested export of electricity by undersea trans-
mission; although such infrastructure does not exist, port
and shipping infrastructure does exist. Thus, research into
ways of storing and exporting marine renewable energy is
indicated.
