High Physician Concern About
Malpractice Risk Predicts More
Aggressive Diagnostic Testing
In Office-Based Practice
ABSTRACT Despite widespread agreement that physicians who practice
defensive medicine drive up health care costs, the extent to which
defensive medicine increases costs is unclear. The differences in findings
to date stem in part from the use of two distinct approaches for assessing
physicians' perceived malpractice risk. In this study we used an
alternative strategy: We linked physicians' responses regarding their levels
of malpractice concern as reported in the 2008 Health Tracking
Physician Survey to Medicare Parts A and B claims for the patients they
treated during the study period, 2007­09. We found that physicians who
reported a high level of malpractice concern were most likely to engage
in practices that would be considered defensive when diagnosing patients
who visited their offices with new complaints of chest pain, headache, or
lower back pain. No consistent relationship was seen, however, when
state-level indicators of malpractice risk replaced self-rated concern.
Reducing defensive medicine may require approaches focused on
physicians' perceptions of legal risk and the underlying factors driving
those perceptions.
There is widespread consensus that
physicians alter their behavior to
reduce their malpractice liability,
but there is considerable disagree-
ment about the magnitude of costs,
harms, andpotentialbenefits associatedwith the
practice of such defensive medicine.1 Prior stud-
ies have produced conflicting findings, creating
confusion for policy makers.2
In this article we explain why existing studies
have not been able to provide conclusive infor-
mation about the extent of defensive medicine.
We also present a new analysis that combines the
greatest strengths of the available approaches
while avoiding some of their weaknesses. Link-
ing physicians' survey responses with their pa-
tients' Medicare claims, we examined whether
physicians' self-reported level of malpractice
concern was associated with their patients' use
of diagnostic imaging services and other tests,
emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital
admissions.
Our analysis examined assurance behaviors
(sometimes called positive defensive medicine),
which include a physician's ordering additional
tests, procedures, or visits and reducing his or
her threshold for hospitalizing patients or refer-
ring them to other physicians. Another type of
defensive medicine is avoidance (or negative)
behaviors--such as physicians' taking steps to
avoid treating patients or conditions perceived
to represent high legal risk.3 Although avoidance
behaviors have troubling implications for pa-
tients' access to care, policy makers tend to be
more concerned about assurance behaviors be-
cause they contribute to escalating national
health care costs.2

Why Measuring Defensive Medicine
Is So Hard
This study's approach--analyzing physicians'
concerns about malpractice liability as a predic-
tor of their patients' fee-for-service Medicare
claims--blends the strengths of two standard ap-
proaches: opinion surveys of individual clini-
cians and cross-state comparisons of claims data
over time. Opinion surveys typically query physi-
cians about their assurance behaviors when
presented with specific clinical vignettes or sce-
narios; researchers subsequently examine corre-
lations between the physicians' self-described
decisions in these hypothetical scenarios and
various measures of liability risk, usually mal-
practice insurance premiums or tort-reform laws
in a state.3­5 In contrast, we used a validated
survey instrument included in a national survey
of physicians who provided direct patient care,6
and we linked the physicians' responses regard-
ing their levels of malpractice concern to Medi-
care claims for the patients they treated during
the study period.
Comparing claims for physicians who report
high levels of concern about malpractice to
claims for those who report less concern pro-
vides a better, more objective comparison of the
two groups' practice behavior in response to the
malpractice environment than using the results
of opinion surveys alone. On surveys, physicians
may sometimes exaggerate their responses to
questions that assess liability pressure, possibly
to help make the case for malpractice policy re-
forms. Alternatively, physicians may be unable
to discriminate between the effects of liability
pressure and those of otherfactors thatinfluence
their decisions to order extra services, such
as patients' expectations and reimbursement
incentives.
Linking claims data to a physician survey also
avoids an important limitation of many claims-
based studies: reliance on the absence or pres-
ence of tort reforms or high malpractice insur-
ance premiums in the state where a particular
physician practices as a proxy for that physi-
cian's propensity to practice defensively. Studies
using this approach have found small effects of
defensive medicine on costs, typically less than
2 percent of total spending.7­9 Studies that focus
on specific high-risk specialties and patients
have found larger effects.10,11 It is difficult to
definitively conclude that differences in care
use across geographic areas are attributable to
differences in liability pressure, as opposed to
other factors.
Additionally, these studies rarely incorporate
direct measures of an individual physician's per-
sonal assessment of his or her malpractice risk,
relying instead on state-level measures. In earlier
work we found state measures of malpractice
risk and specific malpractice tort laws to be only
weakly associated with physicians' fears of mal-
practice suits,6 providing a possible explanation
for the small estimates of the cost of defensive
medicine in claims-based studies.
Hypotheses
We hypothesized that physicians with high levels
of malpractice concern would be more likely
than others to order tests and procedures or
refer patients to other providers to rule out the
most worrisome potential diagnoses, all other
factors being held equal. Of note, we would
not expect malpractice-sensitive physicians to
use more of all types of services for patients with
all symptoms, because some services play little
role in the diagnosis of potentially worrisome
conditions. Instead, we would expect those
physicians to increase their use of specific ser-
vices to either diagnose or rule out severe con-
ditions as causes of the symptoms in question,
without changing their use of other services.
For reasons described below, we chose to ex-
amine the use of services for patients visiting
physicians with complaints of chest pain, head-
ache, or lower back pain.
For chest pain patients not initially seen in the
ED, we expected malpractice-sensitive physi-
cians to use more conventional and more ad-
vanced imaging and to be more likely to have
their patients visit the ED or be admitted to
the hospital, compared to their less sensitive
peers. We expected that the use of stress testing
might be inversely associated with malpractice
concern, if physicians with lower levels of con-
cern were more likely to use this test to assess
patients' risk in lieu of hospitalizing them. For
headache, we expected malpractice-sensitive
physicians to use more advanced imaging and
ED referrals, but not more hospital admissions
or conventional imaging. For lower back pain,
we expected malpractice-sensitive physicians to
use more conventional imaging and more ad-
vanced imaging, and possibly more ED referrals,
but not more hospital admissions.
We found that higher levels of malpractice con-
cern were indeed associated with significantly
higher use of diagnostic services when the com-
parison employed self-reported levels of mal-
practice concern. However, that relationship
was not observed when state-level measures of
risk wereused instead. This finding suggests that
comparisons between states that have differing
malpractice environments might not detect the
presence of defensive medicine.

Study Data And Methods
Data We used a national sample of elderly Medi-
care beneficiaries enrolled in traditional Medi-
care, linked to nationally representative physi-
cian data from the 2008 Center for Studying
Health System Change Health Tracking
Physician Survey (which had a response rate of
62 percent).12 The characteristics of this physi-
cian sample--which asked respondents for dem-
ographic information, specialty, and practice
characteristics and about their concerns regard-
ing involvement in malpractice suits--have been
previously reported.6 Our beneficiary sample in-
cluded nearly 1.9 million patients who received
services from 3,469 physician survey respon-
dents in the period 2007­09. For these linked
beneficiaries, full Parts A and B claims were ob-
tained for the same period. Survey sampling
weights were applied to the beneficiary sample
to make it nationally representative.13
Measures Of Physicians' Malpractice
Concerns The Health Tracking Physician Sur-
vey included five previously validated questions
regarding physicians' fears of malpractice law-
suits and their propensity to engage in positive
defensive medicine.14­16 These questions are
shown in online Appendix Table A1.17 Each ques-
tion elicits physicians' responses on a five-point
Likert scale that ranges from "strongly agree" to
"strongly disagree." We calculated physicians'
overall level of malpractice concern by summing
the scores for the five questions, and we then
classified physicians into terciles based on their
total scores. An alternative specification based
on questions directly focused on defensive medi-
cine yielded similar results (see Appendix
Table A2). Further information about the physi-
cian sample is available in Appendix Table A3.17
To further investigate which measures of mal-
practice risk best explain variations in the use of
care, we compared findings from our survey-
based index of malpractice concern to those
from similar analyses based on state-level indica-
tors of malpractice risk that have been used in
prior claims-based comparisons. The first state
variable was a risk index, defined as malpractice
claims per 1,000 physicians times the average
dollar amount of the award.18 The second was
a binary variable indicating whether the state
capped malpractice awards (noneconomic, pu-
nitive, or total damages). Caps on damages are
often touted as a key mechanism for controlling
defensive medicine.19 This step allowed a com-
parison between the estimates of defensive
medicine based on a comparison of claims from
different states and the estimates from our com-
parative approach.
Measures Of Defensive Medicine We exam-
ined three measures of potentially defensive
medicine that could occureitherduring an initial
visit to a physician's office--rather than the ED--
for a worrisome complaint or within the week
following the visit. Specifically, we noted
whether the patient received certain diagnostic
imaging services or other tests, was referred to
the ED, or was admitted to a hospital. As previ-
ously noted, we analyzed patients who visited a
physician with an initial complaint of one of the
following threesymptoms: chestpain, headache,
or lower back pain. These three common symp-
toms werechosen because they represent a range
of potential underlying problems, from mild and
benign to severe and life threatening (see
Appendix Figure A1 for details)17 and because
physicians have considerable discretion in re-
sponding to these complaints.
Symptoms were indicated in claims using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9), diagnostic codes. The initial
visits we considered took place between July 1,
2008, and December 1, 2009. They were identi-
fied when claims data indicated that during the
previous eighteen months, the patient had nei-
ther received any services for the same or a re-
lated diagnosis nor had a diagnosis for another
condition that would justify the diagnostic
test or service in question. Details on the in-
cluded and excluded diagnoses are provided in
Appendix Tables A4 and A5; unadjusted results
are available in Appendix Tables A6 and A7.17
Results were insensitive to the length of the ob-
servation period following the initial visit.
Analysis Using logistic regression, we related
service use during and after the initial visit to the
physician's level of malpractice concern,control-
ling for beneficiary and physician characteris-
tics. Specifically, our models controlled for
beneficiaries' demographic characteristics,20 co-
morbid conditions,21 and urbanicity of resi-
dence, as well as the specialty of the physician
at the initial visit. Full regression results are
shown in the Appendix Tables A8­A25.17 Re-
sults are presented as adjusted percentages, by
tercile of malpractice concern.
We stratified our analyses by whether the ini-
tial visit was to an ED or a physician's office.We
found that service use was dramatically higher
when the initial visit was to an ED (see Appendix
Table 6).17 For example, subsequent hospitaliza-
tions were fifteen to twenty-six times more likely
for chest pain and lower back pain, respectively,
which suggests that patients seen initially in EDs
have very different clinical profiles than those
who visit physicians' offices instead. Moreover,
diagnostic testing equipment is more readily
available in the ED. In addition, emergency
medicine physicians report higher rates of mal-
practice concern than other physicians do.6

However, malpractice concern was not consis-
tently related to service use for patients whose
initial visits were to an ED (see Appendix
Tables A9, A11, and A13).17 For these reasons,
we limit our presentation of results here to pa-
tients initially seen in physicians' offices.
Limitations Differences in case-mix between
comparison groups may not have been fully cap-
tured by the ICD-9 diagnostic codes. As a result,
residual confounding could have biased our uti-
lization results.
In addition, our sample included only patients
who were diagnosed with a relatively benign
cause of the presenting symptom and those for
whom no underlying cause was identified (for
example, chest pain of unknown origin).We ex-
cluded patients who were assigned a serious or
life-threatening diagnosis. For example, patients
with a diagnosis of nonspecific headache were
included, but those diagnosed with subarach-
noid hemorrhage were excluded. We excluded
patients with serious, definitive diagnoses be-
cause we expected that they would have been
seen by multiple other physicians whose level
of malpractice concern was not measured.
Because physicians with high malpractice con-
cern might be expected to conduct a more ag-
gressive diagnostic evaluation initially, any bias
created by this choice would tend to under-
estimate the use differences between physicians
with high and low levels of malpractice concern.
Appendix Figure A117 describes the range of
health conditions that might be associated with
the three symptoms and the types of tests used
to diagnose these conditions in our analysis
sample.
Study Results
Beneficiary And Visit Characteristics Of the
nearly 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries in our
data set, 29,079 met the criterion of having an
initial visit for one of the three symptoms in a
physician's office or an ED (Exhibit 1). The sub-
samples differed only modestly from each other
in patients' demographic and health character-
istics and in characteristics of the state's mal-
practice environment (Exhibit 1).17 Some bene-
ficiaries with initial visits were missing data used
in the statistical adjustment and thus are not
represented in the adjusted samples.
When we focused on services provided to pa-
tients whose initial visit was to a physician's of-
fice, we found that rates of hospitalization and
referral to the ED were generally low (Exhibit 2).
Rates of diagnostic tests were also low, with the
exception of conventional imaging forchest pain
and lower back pain, supplemental testing
(stress tests) for chest pain, and advanced imag-
ing for headache.
Self-Reported Malpractice Concern And
Defensive Medicine Patients with chest pain
had a significantly higher probability of being
referred to the ED if their physician had a high
or medium level of malpractice concern, com-
pared to a low level (Exhibit 3; unadjusted per-
centages are shown in Appendix Table A6).17
Physicians with a high level of malpractice con-
cern were significantly less likely than those with
a low level to order stress tests, consistent with
our hypothesis that they would be less inclined to
use stress tests as a substitute for a more exten-
sive inpatient workup. The hypothesized rela-
tionships between higher malpractice concern
and higher rates of advanced imaging and hos-
pitalization were observed but were not signifi-
cant.
Patients with headache who saw physicians
with a high level of malpractice concern had a
significantly higher probability of receiving ad-
vanced imaging than patients who saw physi-
cians with a low level of concern--11.5 percent
versus 6.4 percent (Exhibit 3). As expected, rates
of conventional imaging and hospitalization
were extremely low for both groups and were
not significantly associated with the physician's
level of malpractice concern. Contrary to our
expectations, there was no significant associa-
tion between level of concern and referral to
the ED.
Patients with lower back pain who saw physi-
cians with a high level of malpractice concern
had a significantly higher probability of re-
ceiving conventional and advanced imaging
than patients seeing less-concerned physicians
(Exhibit 3). There was no significant difference
in their probability of hospitalization.
State-Level Malpractice Risk And Defen-
sive Medicine Only three significant associa-
tions emerged in our models analyzing state-
level malpractice risk as a predictor of services
received by Medicare beneficiaries (Exhibit 4).
Two of these associations were in the opposite
direction from those in the malpractice-concern
model--that is, use was lower in states with a
higher level of malpractice risk.
Models using the presence of caps on damages
rather than malpractice risk as the liability mea-
sure indicated that caps were associated with
the greater use of some services (Appendix
Tables A20, A22, and A24).17 This counterintui-
tive finding might reflect a problem of reverse
causality--that is, a high prevalence of mal-
practice concern (and defensive medicine)
among physicians might make a state more likely
to adopt a damages cap.

Discussion
This study found that physicians who reported
concern about their malpractice risk and who
evaluated patients visiting their offices with
chest pain, headache, or lower back pain were
significantly more likely to order certain diag-
nostic tests, a pattern consistent with the
practice of defensive medicine. However, these
effects were not observed when state-level mea-
sures of malpractice risk were used in lieu of
individual physicians' reported concerns.
Compared to office-based physicians who re-
ported a low level of concern about malpractice
risk, physicians who reported higher levels of
concern had higher rates of use of diagnostic
imaging for lower back pain and headache.
Although our analysis represents an initial effort
to measure physicians' behavior, physicians' re-
ported levels of concern appeared more strongly
predictive of their use of services than were state-
level measures of malpractice risk in the ambu-
latory care setting. Office-based physicians with
higher levels of concern were more likely to or-
der advanced imagingforpatients withheadache
and lower back pain and conventional imaging
for patients with chest pain and lower back pain,
compared to physicians with low levels of con-
cern. And compared to less-concerned physi-
cians, more-concerned physicians were less
likely to use stress testing for patients with chest
pain and more likely to refer them to the ED,
where a more extensive workup and observation
would likely be performed.
Insights This study provides insights into the
magnitude of defensive medicine in the United
States. Most previous studies have focused on
the use of care in the hospital setting, especially
obstetric care and the evaluation of patients in
the ED. Our study provides a rare look at what
happens in physicians' offices.
In addition, previous studies usually focused
on patients who constitute a relatively high
liability risk. Malpractice awards in obstetrical
cases, for example, can be enormous because
they involveyoung patients and oftenresult from
catastrophic injuries. Patients who visit the ED
forcare arealso riskyto thediagnosingphysician
because their chances of having a serious

problem are generally higher, on average, than
patients who visit a physician's office. In addi-
tion, ED physicians often lack detailed medical
records for their patients and thus face greater
uncertainty than office-based physicians. In con-
trast, our nationally representative sample was
composed of elderly patients who were initially
seen in a physician's office. Although this is not a
group that experts would identify as high risk
from a liability perspective, the use of health
services was significantly greater in this group
of patients if they were seen by physicians with
higher levels of concern about malpractice
lawsuits.
Furthermore, our study helps reconcile the
discrepancy between prior estimates of the cost
of defensive medicine based on physician sur-
veys and those based on state-to-state compari-
sons of defensive medicine.We found that asso-
ciations between malpractice risk and use of
health services were much stronger when the
risk measure used was the physician's perceived
risk rather than objective, state-level measures of
liability risk, such as claims costs or tort reforms.
Our results suggest that prior cost estimates
based on comparisons between states with and
without caps on damages or high malpractice
risk, malpractice premiums, or claims costs (in-
cluding comparisons of variations in states over
time) may not reflect physicians' behavior or
fully capture the influence of physicians' mal-
practice concerns on defensive medicine.
Although it is impossible to say which ap-
proach captures the true prevalence of defensive

medicine, our approach predicts individual pa-
tients' use of services more effectively than do
comparisons based on measures of the physi-
cian's tort environment. Linking survey reports
of physicians' malpractice concern with claims
data offers a promising way to generate more-
accurate estimates of defensive medicine.
Lack Of Clear Association We found no
clear association between physicians' mal-
practice concerns and the services their patients
used when patients initially visited an ED instead
of a physician's office. One possible explanation
for this finding is that emergency physicians
have incorporated defensive practices into their
routine care, so that even those who perceive
themselves to have low levels of malpractice con-
cern already practice in a defensive manner.22
In addition, we did not observe a consistent
relationship between malpractice concern and
the use of diagnostic imaging in patients with
a new complaint of chest pain. This lack of asso-
ciation may indicate either that physicians do
not practice defensively for patients with chest
pain or that any defensive practices are obscured
because a broader range of diagnostic ap-
proaches and the involvement of multiple clini-
cal services may be required to rule out poten-
tially serious causes of this complaint.
Finally, we did not observe a significant rela-
tionship between outpatient physicians' mal-
practice concern and ED use by their patients
with headache in the days following the physi-
cian's initial evaluation. This may reflect the fact
that patients with the most severe headache
symptoms are more likely to go directly to an
ED instead of visiting a physician's office. Find-
ings for lower back pain were more consistent
with an association between physicians' concern
and patients' ED use. Patients seen by a physi-
cian with a medium level of concern were signifi-
cantly more likely to visit the ED than were
patients seen by a physician with a low level of
concern. Patients seen by a physician with a high
level of concern were also more likely to visit the
ED, but that result was not significant.
Overcoming Physicians' Fear Of Mal-
practice Claims Previous comparisons of
states with and without tort reforms (such as
caps on damages, limits on attorney's fees, and
reductions in the time that plaintiffs have to file a
claim) suggest that the presence of tort reforms
does little to limit use of health care. This has led
to inferences that the total cost of defensive
medicine is low.23 An alternative explanation,
empirically supported by previous work, is that
the kinds of tort reforms that states have adopted
to date do not appreciably reduce physicians'
level of malpractice concern,6 and it is perceived
rather than actual risk that determines how
physicians behave.
Policy approaches that target the underlying
causes of physicians' malpractice concerns
might reduce defensive medicine more effec-
tively than current estimates suggest. Being sued
is associated with substantial distress for physi-
cians, but tort reforms are generally aimed at
lowering the cost of eventual payouts to the ex-
clusion of otherapproaches. Physicians' extreme
dread of malpractice litigation may stem from
their perception that it is unpredictable, un-
controllable, and potentially disastrous both fi-
nancially and psychologically.6
To some extent, this fear might be ameliorated
simply by better informing physicians about the
actual dynamics of the malpractice claims proc-
ess. For example, prior studies show that physi-
cians greatly overestimate their risk of being
sued;24 the actual risk of facing a malpractice
claim in specialties such as emergency medicine
may not be any greater than the average risk for
all physicians;25 only about one in fifty injuries
caused by negligence result in a claim;26 lawsuits
are virtually never settled for amounts in excess
of a physician's insurance policy limits (and thus
involve little personal financial risk for physi-
cians);27 claims are resolved in ways concordant
with their merit three-quarters of the time;28 and
malpractice plaintiffs lose four out of five trials.28
Physicians, most of whom are unaware of
these data, may have exaggerated perceptions
of legal risk. However, our prior work,6 which
found that physicians' levels of malpractice fear
are not substantially different in states with and
without tort reforms, suggests that physicians'
attitudes may be hard to align with their ac-
tual risk.
This persistence in risk perceptions may,
again, reflect the dread involved in perceptions
of this type of risk. The experience of being sued
is undeniably distressing--it has been described

as one of the most stressful experiences a physi-
cian can have,27 engendering shame, self-doubt,
and emotional trauma.29­31 A recent study found
that the average physician spends almost 11 per-
cent of his or her career practicing in the shadow
of an unresolved malpractice claim.32 Neither
insurance nor traditional tort reforms address
these harms. Reforms need to reassure physi-
cians that medical injuries can be resolved
expeditiously and fairly, in a less adversarial
manner.
To achieve this goal, reforms need to facilitate
communication between physicians and pa-
tients about why adverse outcomes occurred;
to explain, in some cases, that the standard of
care was met; to provide reasonable compensa-
tion rapidly when it was not met; and to keep
disputes from escalating into full-blown litiga-
tion. Several approaches are promising.23
Communication-and-resolution programs, in
which health care institutions proactively dis-
close errors, apologize, and offer compensation
before the patient files a claim, could reduce the
numbers and costs of lawsuits and speed the
process of resolution. So could expanded use
of mediation.
Another, farther-reaching reform would be to
replace litigation in the courts with an adminis-
trative compensation system, akin to workers
compensation. Administrative compensation
proposals typically suggest that patients should
not have to prove that their providers were neg-
ligent, only that their injury could have been
avoided in an optimal system of care. Although
politically challenging, such proposals are ap-
pealing because trying to avoid the emotional
distress of being labeled as negligent may drive
a great deal of defensive behavior among phy-
sicians.
A final approach is to give care providers a
strong defense to allegations of malpractice,
known as a "safe harbor," if they can show that
they followed an applicable, well-accepted, evi-
dence-based practice guideline. By promoting
national, evidence-based standards of care, in-
stead of holding physicians to the prevailing
standard in their state or community, safe har-
bors also have the potential to reduce geographic
variation in the provision of some services.33
Conclusion
Malpractice reform alone is unlikely to solve the
problem of overuse of health care services, which
has multiple drivers. Fee-for-service reimburse-
ment provides a financial incentive to order
more services. Patients' demands for services
may be hard to resist. Finally, physicians may
be averse to the risk of missing something and
harming the patient--not just the risk of being
sued when such harm occurs. Human beings'
known tendency to overestimate the probability
of rare but serious risks reinforces physicians'
tendency to take excessive precautions.
Although malpractice reform can't root out all
of these problems, it needs to be part of their
solutions. Our study suggests that innovative re-
forms that address the underlying causes of de-
fensive medicine have potential rewards far be-
yond their advantages for individual patients
and clinicians--rewards that make them worth
pursuing.
