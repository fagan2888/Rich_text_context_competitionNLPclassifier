DataWatch
Victim Costs Of Violent Crime And Resulting Injuries
by Ted R. Miller, Mark A. Cohen, and Shelli B. Rossman
Abstract: This DataWatch estimates the costs and monetary value of lost quality of life due to death
and nonfatal physical and psychological injury resulting from violent crime. In 1987 physical injury
to people age twelve and older resulting from rape, robbery, assault, murder, and arson caused about
$10 billion in potential health-related costs, including some unmet mental health care needs. It led
to $23 billion in lost productivity and almost $145 billion in reduced quality of life (in 1989 dollars).
Ifassociated deaths and cases resulting in psychological injury only are included, costs average $47,000
for rape, $19,000 for robbery, $15,000 for assault, and $25,000 for arson. Considering only survivors
with physical injury, rapes cost $60,000, robberies $25,000, assaults $22,000, and arson $50,000. Costs
are almost $2.4 million per murder. Lifetime costs for all intentional injuries totaled $178 billion
during 1987-1990.
In a discussion of violence and its impact on society, one aspect to
consider is the cost of violent crime to victims. It is useful to quantify
costs in this way for several reasons. They are important both in
characterizing the crime problem and in examining ways to address it. They
allow analysts and advocates to combine statistics on disparate crimes into
a single, readily understood metric. They guide resource allocation.1 They
provide insight into such crucial policy issues as the likely costs of mental
health care for crime victims if mental health care were to be universally
reimbursed. They allow program planners and evaluators to estimate the cost
savings from a community policing program. And they yield insight into the
rationality of early prisoner release programs.
This DataWatch provides estimates of the cost of violent crime to the
victims, based on data from several national data sets.

nonfatal rape, robbery, and assault. In face-to-face interviews, victims re-
port nonfatal victimization, physical injury, work losses, and selected costs.
Familial violence (child abuse, elder abuse, and spousal assault) and rape
probably are underreported in the NCS.2 The NCS excludes victimization
of children under age twelve, military personnel, the institutionalized, and
the homeless. For this study we used average NCS incidence counts for
1987-1990, during which period overall crime incidence was essentially
stable. Homicides, for example, numbered between 20,000 and 22,000 each
year.3 We computed unit costs of crime injury using the 1987 NCS.
The quality of the injury costs from the NCS victim self-reports is suspect
for several reasons. The survey asks victims to recall details of crimes that
occurred up to six months earlier. Victims who suffered minor injuries at
the start of this time period may forget small costs, while those who suffered
serious injury may be unaware of the cumulative costs. For example, hospi-
tal bills may go directly to the insurer, so that the insured never learns of the
amount. Also, the NCS includes only costs through the interview date, on
average only three months after victimization.
Our source for nonfatal and fatal injuries in arson fires was 1987 esti-
mates from the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), which
compiles fire department reports. Both civilian and firefighter injuries are
included. NFIRS relies on voluntary reporting, with about half of all fire
departments participating. The U.S. Fire Administration applies an algo-
rithm to generate national NFIRS estimates. Given the nonrandom sam-
ple, these weighted estimates clearly are imperfect.
Our third source was the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uni-
form Crime Reports (UCR), which counts other fatal injuries and largely
allocates them among rape, robbery, and assault. Circumstances underlying
murders were known in two-thirds of the cases. We distributed the remain-
der proportionally to cases with known circumstances.
Cost framework. The cost estimates presented here represent an initial
effort to estimate recent costs of victimization, using mostly secondary data.
The findings represent a preliminary, rather than a definitive, study. The
cost framework and methods build from earlier studies.4 Like those studies,
this DataWatch describes three categories of costs: ( 1 ) direct losses other
than property losses--including costs of medical, mental health, and emer-
gency response services, as well as insurance administration; (2) productiv-
ity losses--wages, fringe benefits, and housework; and (3) nonmonetary
losses--pain, suffering, and lost quality of life. We excluded property losses
and the costs society incurs to prevent future crime.
This DataWatch presents two sets of cost estimates. One set shows the
cost per physically injured crime victim, with murder treated as a separate
category. The second shows costs per victimization associated with com-

pleted or attempted crime. This latter version incorporates many crimes
that resulted in psychological injury only. It also allocates murders to their
underlying cause: A rape-murder victim is considered a rape victim, some-
one murdered during a robbery is a robbery victim, and someone murdered
during a quarrel is an assault victim. Thus, this version shows the relative
seriousness of different crimes (which is useful, for example, when debating
appropriate penalties).
Medical costs. Average medical costs per fatal injury came from
Dorothy Rice and colleagues; no differentiation by cause was possible.5 The
NCS captures only short-term medical costs for rape, robbery, and assault.
Thus, to estimate long-term medical costs, we used the only national data
available on the temporal distribution of injury medical costs: the Detailed
Claims Information (DCI) database of the National Council on Compen-
sation Insurance (NCCI). This database longitudinally tracks the medical
care costs of 450,000 randomly sampled victims of disabling workplace
injuries suffered between 1979 and 1987.6 Our computations assumed that
the unknown NCS injury distribution within each NCS injury category
was similar to the DCI injury distribution within each category.
The DCI excludes rape. To estimate long-term costs for rape, we applied
the percentage of medical costs beyond six months for the DCI category
with the highest percentage of costs within six months (92 percent). Rape,
however, may have potentially costly long-term consequences. For exam-
ple, the NCS does not ask explicitly about pregnancy, abortion, venereal
diseases, or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
disease syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Carole Jenny and colleagues reported that
43 percent of a sample of 204 victims examined within seventy-two hours
after rape incidents showed evidence of sexually transmitted diseases.7
Among victims who showed no evidence of such diseases at the initial
examination and who were not treated to prevent them, the incidence of
new diseases ranged from 2 percent for chlamydia to 19 percent for bacterial
vaginosis.
The distribution of injuries in arson fires came from unpublished NFIRS
data. We used DCI unit costs of burns and smoke inhalation; for other
injuries we assumed that average medical costs per arson-related injury are
the same as for comparable injuries (for example, a broken bone) to assault
and robbery victims.
Some incidents of victimization may aggravate preexisting conditions
that later cause significant health problems. For example, elderly victims
may be at increased risk of future heart attacks.8 Our estimates capture these
costs incompletely.
Mental health costs. Despite a growing awareness of post-traumatic
stress disorder and the psychological impact of intentional injury on its

victims, estimates of mental health-related expenses for victims are not
readily available.9 In fact, the NCS does not query respondents about
mental health treatment. Exhibit 1 estimates crime victims' mental health
injury rates. For example, an estimated 10 percent of rape victims suffer
from severely disabling psychological injury, and 40 percent suffer from
emotional distress severe enough to require mental health treatment be-
yond initial counseling.
To derive these frequencies, we started with the literature-based esti-
mates by Mark Cohen.10 More recent literature confirmed the order of
magnitude of Cohen's rape estimates but provided better estimates for other
crimes. Specifically, Dean Kilpatrick's survey of 391 Charleston, South
Carolina, women estimated that psychological injury resulted from 57
percent of completed rapes, 37 percent of aggravated assaults, and 18
percent of completed robberies.11 The psychological injury rate for com-
pleted rape was 3.3 times the rate for attempted rape. We assumed that this
ratio applied to other crimes and that rates for men and women were
comparable. Weighting the Kilpatrick psychological injury rates for com-
pleted versus attempted crimes by NCS crime completion rates yields
overall psychological injury rates. Following Cohen, we assumed that the
ratio of severe disorder to distress was one to four for rape. For other crimes,
we assumed a ratio of one to eight. Those ratios allowed us to compute
injury rates by severity from the total. These estimates exclude the cost of
treating post-traumatic stress disorder in family members, police, and other
service providers.
No data describe typical mental health care use by crime victims. Follow-
ing Cohen, we assumed that potential mental health costs per injury for the
psychological injuries in Exhibit 1 equal average mental health care costs
incurred by people who won jury verdicts for emotional distress ($4,160)
and severely disabling psychological injury ($24,800). These costs are po-
tential costs because they describe a population whose psychological inju-
ries were treated. An unknown portion of psychological injury victims go

untreated. Thus, potential mental health costs overestimate current costs.
Victim services. Victim service organizations provide a range of serv-
ices, including counseling, shelter, and financial assistance. The United
States has more than 2,000 victim service programs. The U.S. Department
of Justice Office of Victims of Crime supports 1,422 of these. These agen-
cies receive more than $35 million in funding as a result of the Victims of
Crime Act (VOCA). The ratio of VOCA to nonfederal funding is at least
three to one. Since VOCA funds no more than 70 percent of all victim
service agencies, the total expenditures on victim services probably ex-
ceeded $200 million in 1987. The bulk of these expenditures are used for
programs designed to deal with rape, domestic violence, and child abuse.
Since we lack a breakdown by victim type, these costs were excluded from
the analysis.
Emergency response costs. Emergency response costs are derived from
reported crimes. We surveyed eight police departments about primary re-
sponse and follow-up investigative times. Automated police data show time
spent by type of crime but not whether the victim was physically injured.
We used averages by crime. Unit costs of police response were calculated as
salary plus fringe benefits and administrative overhead multiplied by the
average time spent on a case per category of crime.12 Although some police
time is overtime, we valued all time as regular time.
The NCS lacks data on emergency transport. We used the 1980 National
Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) estimate of
average emergency transport costs for hospitalized nonfatal injuries of $144
per one-way transport. We arbitrarily assumed that all persons who were
admitted as hospital inpatients had been transported by ambulance and
that persons who were not inpatients had not received such emergency
transport. Emergency transport and coroner costs for highway crash fatali-
ties were assumed to be comparable to homicide costs.13
Productivity losses. Productivity costs per homicide average $610,000.
This average is the productivity loss per firearm-related fatality inflated to
1987 dollars and adjusted to a 2.5 percent discount rate (in the range used
by courts in compensating liability).14 It is based on the victim's age and sex
only. It was not adjusted for victims' income levels or other demographic
characteristics. Adjusting probably would lower the value.
For victims of nonfatal injury, the NCS data described workdays lost
during the first few months after injury. Lost wages per day were assumed to
equal average daily earnings in private nonagricultural industries. Lost
housework days were estimated at 1.5 times the number of lost workdays for
those who reported employment. We assumed that victims who were not
students or workers lost the same number of housework days as workers lost.

housekeeping services: $5,169 for the employed and $9,131 for the non-
employed.15
We assumed that all victims under age nineteen were students but that
no older victims were. The value of lost schooldays was calculated as the
average workdays per worker, reduced by 25 percent due to the seasonality
of the school year. Each lost schoolday was valued at $23.96, the average
annual cost per pupil in average daily attendance divided by an assumed
average school year of 166 days.16 Arson-related productivity losses were
estimated in the same manner as medical costs.
To compute long-term productivity loss, we first computed the primary
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) distribution for hospitalized
victims of rape, robbery, and assault, using California, Washington, and
Vermont hospital discharge tapes with mandatory cause coding. Similarly,
we computed the ICD distribution of nonhospitalized crime injuries from a
convenience sample of twenty-one emergency rooms (in nine communi-
ties) that were able to supply this information. For physical injuries associ-
ated with rape, robbery, and assault, we multiplied the number of cases by
ICD code and hospitalization status times the corresponding DCI prob-
abilities of permanent total and partial disability to get probabilities by type
of crime and hospitalization status.17 We combined the hospitalized and
nonhospitalized probabilities using NCS hospitalization rates. For arson, we
applied the disability probabilities to the NFIRS arson injury distribution.
To translate the permanent disabilities into productivity losses, we multi-
plied them times $610,000 (average productivity costs per homicide) for
permanent disabilities and 17 percent of this amount for partial disabili-
ties.18 The long-term productivity losses average $1,261 for rape, $741 for
robbery, $476 for assault, and $1,411 for arson.
Program administration. The administrative costs of health and dis-
ability insurance were estimated by multiplying the appropriate costs times
the percentage reimbursed by each type of payer times type-specific insur-
ance loss-adjustment expense ratios.19 For example, life insurance adminis-
trative cost was estimated as a 9 percent administrative cost on average life
insurance coverage of $47,000 per U.S. adult.20 This cost factor was applied
to adult victims only.
Lost quality of life. Nonmonetary costs of intentional injury include
pain, suffering, fear, and lost quality of life. These costs were estimated
using two techniques: jury compensation and willingness to pay.
Following Cohen, we estimated the jury compensation for pain, suffer-
ing, and lost quality of life received by victims of physical injuries similar to
those reported in the NCS. We started from jury award data from Jury
Verdict Research, which lists compensatory damage awards and medical
care and productivity losses. We estimated regression equations predicting

pain and suffering as a function of the medical care and productivity costs
and category of injuries, then substituted in average NCS costs by crime.
Pain and suffering due to psychological injury were estimated as a function
of mental health care costs from average awards for emotional distress and
severe psychological trauma in cases without physical injury. For victims
without physical or psychological injury, a fear component was estimated.
This component is based upon a few jury awards in Louisiana, where the
courts allow recovery for fear without injury. Estimating these costs using
jury verdict data implicitly assumes that victims receive required mental
health care. Victims not receiving needed treatment would experience
higher psychological injury costs.
Willingness-to-pay estimates--value-of-life estimates derived from the
amount people willingly pay for safety when, for example, buying a smoke
detector or an automobile with airbags--were made using values of fatal
risk reduction from a literature review and synthesis by Ted Miller.21 For
nonfatal injuries, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost were estimated
using previously developed methods, then multiplied times a value per life
year derived from the value per life lost. To derive the quality-adjusted life
years, we started with physician ratings of typical functional capacity loss by
injury on six dimensions: cognitive, mobility, sensory, cosmetic, pain, and
activities of daily living (essentially, bending, lifting, and grasping). We
added a work-related disability dimension, based on the DCI disability
probabilities. The capacity losses were combined into a single quality-
adjusted life year loss per injury using survey data on the relative value loss
associated with each dimension and level of functional loss.22
Willingness-to-pay amounts generally equaled an estimated 70 to 80
percent of jury compensation amounts. Quality-adjusted life year ratings
were not available for rape, knife wounds, gunshot wounds, and psychologi-
cal injuries. Based on the ratio for other injuries, we assumed that willing-
ness to pay is 75 percent of jury compensation for these injuries. The
exhibits show pain, suffering, and lost quality of life due to physical injury
computed as willingness to pay minus the productivity losses.
These losses largely come from typical injury settings, not crime settings.
Therefore, quality-of-life losses due to psychological injury were computed
from the mental health care costs (as described above) and added. The costs
of fear were applied only to cases without physical or psychological injury.

for crime victims age twelve and older. This exhibit omits secondary vie-
tims--family members and others whose quality of life is adversely affected
by the crime. The victimization count includes repeat victimizations; the
victim and injury counts refer only to single victimizations and the most
recent incident for serial victimizations.
Exhibit 2 describes the number of victimizations, the number of victims,
and the percentage of victimizations that were fatal. It also shows the
percentage of survivors who sustained injuries and the percentage of the
injured who were hospitalized. Nearly one-third of crime survivors reported
some physical injury. Sixty-one percent of rape and attempted rape survi-
vors reported physical injuries. Injuries were reported by 36 percent of
robbery or attempted robbery survivors and 29 percent of assault or at-
tempted assault survivors. Approximately 3 percent of arson fires resulted in
civilian injury and 11 percent in firefighter injury. Of those reporting injury
due to rape, robbery, and assault, 5 percent were hospitalized.
More than 4 percent of injured victims sustained gunshot or stab wounds,
and almost 7 percent had bones broken or teeth knocked out. The vast
majority (81 percent) of victims who reported injury, however, suffered
nothing more serious than bruises, cuts, and scratches.
Criminal victimization accounts for 3.3 percent of all injuries.23 Intent to
harm makes these injuries atypically severe. They include 14 percent of
injury deaths and 4 percent of hospital admissions.

physical injury, rapes cost $60,000, robberies $25,000, assaults $22,000, and
arson almost $50,000. Lost quality of life generally is about three-fourths of
the total cost.
Excluding psychological costs, the cost per crime-related physical injury
victim (across fatal and nonfatal injuries) averaged $31,300. By compari-
son, the average noncrime injury (attempted suicide or unintentional in-
jury) cost $23,400.24 The difference is that intentional injuries are more
often fatal than unintentional injuries, on average. Nonfatal injury costs
averaged $16,600 for crime injuries and $18,300 for other injuries.
Exhibit 4 shows unit costs for all crimes. The costs include attempted
crimes (rape, robbery, and assault attempts that resulted in sufficient physi-
cal or psychological injury to cause the victim to view them as criminal
victimization even though they were not completed) and crimes without
physical injury. They also allocate murder costs to the crimes, primarily
assaults, that underlie the murders. From this perspective, rapes have the
highest average cost at $47,000, followed by arson at $25,000, robbery at
$19,000, and assault at $15,000. Not surprisingly, psychological trauma
costs dominate the rape costs. Aside from differences in psychological
trauma costs, a rape costs only slightly more than a robbery or an assault.
Exhibit 5 gives lifetime costs of injury to persons age twelve and older
due to rape, robbery, assault, arson, and murder, computed from average
annual incidence during 1987-1990. Lifetime costs for these injuries total

reported crime in the NCS, its actual share of the total is underestimated
here. Unless the distribution of injuries varies between reported and unre-
ported rapes, however, the costs per case would not be affected.

196 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Winter 1993
Including administrative costs, lifetime medical costs of intentional in-
jury for persons age twelve and older due to rape, robbery, assault, and arson
total $2.9 billion. Violent crime accounts for about 5 percent of injury
treatment costs.25 Including related spending for treatment, administrative
costs, emergency transport, and mental health treatment brings potential
health-related spending due to violent crime against those ages twelve and
over to about $10 billion. Associated productivity losses exceed $23 billion.
At $7.2 billion, the potential mental health care and related administra-
tive costs of rape, robbery, assault, and arson dwarf the medical costs. One
reason is that many victims suffer only psychological injury. However, even
among those with physical injuries, psychological costs dominate the pic-
ture. Current spending needs to be measured against this potential cost. A
key question is how much spending would grow if mental health care were
reimbursed more extensively, as it would be under President Clinton's
health care reform proposal. Despite the dominance of mental health costs
in crime-related injuries, typically only physical injury costs are included in
estimates of violence and injury costs. Policymakers should take note of this
disparity as different health care reform plans are debated.

comparable to the NCS incidence questions.
