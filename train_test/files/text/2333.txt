ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Suicide Categories by Patterns of Known Risk Factors
A Latent Class Analysis
Joseph Logan, PhD; Jeffrey Hall, PhD; Debra Karch, PhD
Context: Multiple risk factors contribute to suicides; how-
ever, patterns of co-occurrence among these factors have
not been fully identified.
Objectives: To assess patterns of known suicide-
related risk factors, classify suicide decedents by these
patterns, track class proportions during a 6-year period,
and characterize decedents across the classes to help fo-
cus prevention strategies.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Latent class analy-
sis was conducted using 2003-2008 data from the Na-
tional Violent Death Reporting System. The population
included 28 703 suicide decedents from 12 US states.
Main Outcome Measures: The known risk factors in-
cluded having the following: mental health conditions;
a sad or depressed mood; substance abuse problems; medi-
cal problems; recent crises; financial, job, and legal prob-
lems; intimate partner and other relationship problems;
and perpetrated interpersonal violence.
Results: Nine distinct patterns of risk factors emerged.
Of these classes, 1 only endorsed mental health­related
factors and 1 only endorsed alcohol- and substance abuse­
related factors; however, 7 classes of decedents had dis-
tinct patterns of factors that spanned multiple domains.
For example, 5 of these classes had mental health fac-
tors with other risks (eg, substance abuse, financial prob-
lems, relationship problems, a recent crisis, and medi-
cal problems). Two classes had recent crises with
relationship problems; one of these classes also had high
probabilities for criminal problems and interpersonal vio-
lence. Class proportions differed during the 6 years. Dif-
ferences across classes by demographic and event char-
acteristics were also found.
Conclusions: Most suicide decedents could be classi-
fied by patterns of risk factors. Furthermore, most classes
revealed a need for more connected services across medi-
cal, mental health/substance abuse, and court/social ser-
vice systems. Reducing fragmentation across these agen-
cies and recruiting family, friend, and community support
for individuals experiencing mental health problems
and/or other stress might significantly reduce suicides.

FOR YEARS, SUICIDE HAS BEEN
the fourth-leading cause of
death in the United States for
those between 10 and 65
years of age.1 To prevent sui-
cide, one strategy has been to identify and
prevent the contributing circumstances (ie,
risk factors) common to those who take
their own lives. Health-related risk fac-
tors have included mental health (MH)
problems2-6;certainmedicalconditions(eg,
cancer)7-9; prior suicide attempts2; and sub-
stance abuse.2,10 Other life-stress­related
risk factors have included intimate part-
ner (IP) problems11; job loss12-14 or finan-
cial problems15; recent crisis or stress2; and
experiences with other forms of violence
(eg, child abuse or peer abuse).16,17 While
any one of these factors increases the risk
of suicide, most suicide decedents have
multiple risk factors prior to death.2 There-
fore, strategies designed to prevent sui-
cide might be more effective if they ad-
dress multiple risk factors.2 To provide
direction for such strategies, we identi-
fied common patterns of health-related
and life-stress­related factors (ie, the
most common co-occurring factors)
known to increase risk of suicide among
a suicide decedent population, classified
decedents by these patterns, and as-
sessed annual class proportions during a
6-year period to determine which co-oc-
curring factors need more urgent atten-
tion. We also characterized decedents
(eg, demographic characteristics) and
the incidents (eg, the mechanisms and
weapons used, location of incident) by
these patterns to further understand
their surrounding circumstances.

METHODS
DATA SOURCE
The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is an
incident-based surveillance system that captures details on dif-
ferent types of violent deaths, including suicides.18,19 Data col-
lection began in 2003 in 7 states (Alaska, Maryland, Massa-
chusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia).
In 2004, 6 states were added (Colorado, Georgia, North Caro-
lina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). In 2005, 4 states
were added (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah),
bringing the total (as of 2008) to 17 states. Data collection is
statewide with the exception of California, which collects data
in only 4 counties (Los Angeles, Riverside, San Francisco, and
Santa Clara).
The NVDRS collects details such as information on dece-
dents, the mechanisms and weapons involved in the inci-
dents, and the circumstances leading up to the violent deaths.18
Data are collected from coroner or medical examiner reports,
toxicology reports, law enforcement records, and death cer-
tificates and are linked by incident into a single repository.
States manage data collection through state health depart-
ments or a subcontracted entity, such as a medical examiner's
office, where data are gathered and coded by trained abstrac-
tors. Data may be manually extracted from reports or im-
ported electronically from other systems (eg, Bureau of Vital
Statistics death certificate files). All data are reviewed by the
abstractor to ensure accuracy of the codes and adherence to the
NVDRS coding manual.20 The NVDRS has been described in
further detail elsewhere.18,20
CASE DEFINITION AND POPULATION
The data used for this analysis represent calendar years 2003
to 2008. Case identification was conducted from an NVDRS
database that was updated through March 2010. Suicide dece-
dents were identified by the final manner of death they were
assigned by the data abstractors; abstractors make this deter-
mination using information from the death certificates (ie, the
listed manner of death and the external cause of death codes)
as well as from the coroner or medical examiner and law en-
forcement reports. Based on this initial criterion, 49 265 sui-
cide decedents were identified from 17 states. Two additional
inclusion criteria were also required. First, because this study
focused on patterns of co-occurring risk factors, a case had to
have circumstance information documented for at least 2 health-
related or life-stress­related risk factors. This criterion yielded
36 756 cases (74.6%) overall. Second, states had to have at least
two-thirds of their cases meet this first criterion to be in-
cluded. States that did not meet this criterion might have had
difficulties with capturing suicide circumstance information.
In such situations, it is likely that circumstance data were not
missing at random; therefore, a fair assessment of patterns for
these states might have been problematic. As a result of this
criterion, cases from 5 states (South Carolina, Georgia, Ken-
tucky, California, and New Jersey) were excluded. The final
sample included 28 703 cases from 12 NVDRS states.
VARIABLES
The known health-related and life-stress­related risk factors
used to assess the patterns included having a current de-
pressed mood; a current MH condition (ie, a documented con-
dition); a history of MH conditions (approximated by having
a history of MH treatment); alcohol problems; other sub-
stance abuse problems; medical problems believed to have pre-
cipitated the suicide (eg, chronic pain or cancer); financial prob-
lems; job problems; criminal legal problems; a recent crisis
(within 2 weeks); a recent exposure to a death (eg, recent death
of a friend or family member); IP or other relationship prob-
lems; a history of perpetrating interpersonal violence; and a his-
tory of suicide attempts. We also included information on
whether the decedent was suspected of using alcohol at the time
of the incident and whether the decedent disclosed his or her
intent to commit suicide. All of the variables were not mutu-
ally exclusive. Three known risk factors (ie, school problems,
other legal problems, and violence victimization) were ex-
cluded because of low prevalence estimates. (Throughout this
article, we use the term known risk factors because these items
have been identified as risk factors for suicide in previous stud-
ies; in the NVDRS, these items are often referred to as "pre-
ceding circumstances of suicide" because the system is cur-
rently unable to assess relative risk.)
After categorization by the pattern of known risk factors,
we also characterized the decedents by demographic factors
(eg, race/ethnicity, sex, age, and marital status), military sta-
tus (ie, whether the decedent ever served in the US military),
and whether they accessed MH treatment prior to death. We
also characterized the incidents by the type of location (eg,
home, recreational area, or commercial area) and the type of
mechanism and weapon used (eg, firearm, poisoning,
hanging).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify distinct pat-
terns of known risk factors for suicide among the decedents
and to classify these decedents by these patterns. The LCA
method is very useful in identifying distinct classes based on
patterns of nonmutually exclusive categorical variables21 such
as the known risk factors.21 To determine which model best ex-
plained the patterns of known risk factors (eg, a 3-class model
identifies 3 classes [or patterns], a 4-class model identifies
4 classes, and so forth), we used the Bayesian information
criterion (see footnote i of the eAppendix, http://www
.archgenpsychiatry.com). We also considered the entropy value
(see footnote ii of the eAppendix). Based on these criteria, we
chose a 9-class model. Details on LCA and our model selec-
tion process are provided in the eAppendix and eTable. This
analysis was first conducted for suicide decedents in each NVDRS
data year to assess the stability of latent class structures (eg,
whether the characteristics of each class identified were simi-
lar in each data year). Because the same classes (ie, distinct pat-
terns) emerged in each data year, we then consolidated the data
for the 2003 through 2008 data years. All LCAs were per-
formed using Mplus version 5.1 statistical software (Muthen
and Muthen, Los Angeles, California).
To show how each class had distinct patterns of known
risk factors, we provided the class-specific item endorsement
probabilities for each factor. We also assessed the proportion
of each class by year and characterized each of the classes by
the descriptive variables. The Cochran-Armitage test for
trends was used to test for the presence of linear trends in the
proportion of decedents in each latent class across data years
examined in this study. The tests determine significant
increases or decreases in class proportions using data from all
years beyond a reference year. Because the NVDRS was
expanding from 2003 through 2005, significant changes
detected by these tests might have been an artifact of the sys-
tem capturing more cases; therefore, Cochran-Armitage tests
were conducted for each class using 3 starting points: 2003,
2004, and 2005. Each analysis used 2-tailed tests, and signifi-
cance was determined at the P=.05 level.

RESULTS
CLASS ASSIGNMENT FOR PATTERNS
OF KNOWN RISK FACTORS
The number of classes, the proportion of respondents as-
signed to each class, and the endorsement probabilities
for each factor by class are presented in Table 1.
Class 1 exemplified MH conditions with alcohol prob-
lems (n=2567 [8.9%]). This class endorsed high prob-
abilities for MH-related risk factors, alcohol depen-
dence, and suspected alcohol use at the time of death.
Compared with other classes, this group also had the high-
est probabilities for having other substance abuse prob-
lems and previous suicide attempts.
Class 2 displayed MH conditions with recent crises
(n=4193 [14.6%]). This class had high probabilities for
all MH-related risk factors as well as a moderately high
probability for having a crisis within 2 weeks of death.
This class differed from the first by having low probabili-
ties for alcohol and substance abuse problems.
Class3hadMHconditionsonly(n=7138[24.9%]).This
class was the last of the 3 classes that endorsed all of the
MH-related risk factors. In contrast to the first 2 classes,
this class had low probabilities for all other factors.
Class 4 decedents had a current depressed mood with
financial problems (n=3574 [12.5%]). This class had a
high probability for being recognized as having a de-
pressed mood around the time of death; however, they
had a low probability for having a documented MH con-
dition. This class also had the highest probability for hav-
ing experienced financial problems.
Class 5 exhibited alcohol problems with other life
stresses (n=1249 [4.4%]). These decedents had high prob-
abilities for alcohol-related risk factors and moderate to
high probabilities for a variety of life stresses (eg, a re-
cent crisis, job problems, IP problems). They also had a
moderately high probability for being identified as hav-
ing a depressed mood but a low probability for having a
documented MH condition.
Class 6 had medical problems with depressed mood
(n=2641 [9.2%]). For this class, the probability for hav-
ing medical problems that were believed to have contrib-
uted to the suicide was 1.000, or 100%. Like classes 4 and
5,thisclassalsohadamoderatelyhighprobabilityforbeing
identified as having a depressed mood but a low probabil-
ity for having a documented MH condition.
Class 7 experienced recent crises with criminal legal
problems (n=1875 [6.5%]). This group had the highest
probabilities for having a recent crisis and recent crimi-
nal problems. This group also had moderate probabili-
ties for having relationship problems and perpetrating
interpersonal violence (eg, domestic violence, violence
among acquaintances).
Class 8 encountered IP problems with recent crises
(n=3015 [10.5%]). This group also had a moderately high
probability for being suspected of alcohol use at the time
of death.
Lastly, class 9 is characterized as being suspected of
alcohol use at the time of death (n=2451 [8.5%]). This

SUICIDE CLASS PROPORTIONS BY YEAR
FROM 2003 THROUGH 2008
Across all years, class 3 was the most common class of
decedents (Table 2). The Cochran-Armitage tests sup-
ported significant changes in the class proportions for 3
classes, regardless of which reference year (2003, 2004,
or 2005) was used (comparisons were significant at the
P=.05 level). The annual proportion of decedents allo-
cated to class 2 significantly increased during the study
period, while the annual proportions of decedents allo-
cated to classes 6 and 7 steadily decreased in this time.
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
Many similarities were observed across the classes. For
example, in each class, most decedents (73.9%) were
of white non-Hispanic racial/ethnic status, most dece-
dents (64.0%) were male, the most common mecha-
nism or weapon used was a firearm (38.5%), and the
most common location of death was at a house or an apart-
ment (59.5%) (Table 3). Also, classes 1 through 3
(those identified with a current MH condition) had simi-
lar patterns of MH diagnoses, with depression or dys-
thymia listed as the most common diagnosis (75.2%-
77.8%), bipolar disorder as the second most common
diagnosis (13.5%-14.7%), and anxiety disorder as the third
most common disorder (7.7%-9.1%).
Several differences were also discovered. Classes 1
through 3, those with documented MH conditions, had
the highest proportions of female decedents (25.6%-
36.1%). These 3 classes were the only classes who had
decedents in MH treatment prior to death (75.9% were
in treatment) and were the 3 classes with the highest pro-
portion of decedents who died by poisoning (25.2%).
Class 7 (those with recent crises and criminal legal prob-
lems) had the highest proportion of decedents younger
than 20 years, whereas class 6 decedents (those with con-
tributing medical problems) had the highest proportion
of decedents aged 65 years or older. Class 6 also had the
highest proportion of decedents who were widowed, di-
vorced, or separated from their spouse and who had served
in the military.
COMMENT
Suicide is a complex phenomenon often resulting from
multiple risk factors.2,22 We found that distinct patterns
among these factors exist. Similar to previous research,
we found the following: the majority of decedents were
non-Hispanic white males1,23; the most common place of
death was at a residence24; the most common mecha-
nism or weapon used was a firearm23,25; decedents with
contributing medical problems were older7; those with
criminal legal problems were younger26,27; and many de-
cedents who had MH conditions also had substance abuse
problems.28-31 Furthermore, previous research found that
females are more likely than males to access MH treat-
ment32,33 and attempt suicide by poisoning or less lethal
means.34-37 Therefore, as expected, we found higher pro-
portions of females and poisoning deaths among classes
with higher proportions of decedents who accessed MH
treatment.
Additionally, we found that more than 10 000 dece-
dents who had MH issues (ie, who either had a docu-
mented condition or were known to have a sad or de-
pressed mood) were experiencing other risk factors prior
to death and that the proportions of decedents experi-
encing MH problems with a recent crisis (class 2) have
been increasing in recent years, although more years of
data might be needed to substantiate this trend. Further-
more, at least 75% of those in classes 1 through 3--classes
that consisted of half the entire decedent population--
were in MH treatment around the time of death, which

with treatment. The MH treatment alone might not suf-
ficiently address both the MH condition and potential co-
occurring life stressors, or these stressors might be dis-
rupting the treatment process (eg, a recent crisis or
substance abuse might deter compliance with treatment
regimens). For those with only MH conditions, addi-
tional social support might still be needed to help moni-
tor treatment and prevent suicidal behavior.
We also found that many decedents had a recent cri-
sis with IP or other relationship problems in the ab-
sence of having known MH conditions, as indicated by

aFor each variable grouping, cells may not total 100% due to rounding.
bClass 1 indicates MH conditions with alcohol problems; class 2, MH conditions with recent crises; class 3, MH conditions only; class 4, current depressed
mood with financial problems; class 5, alcohol problems with other life stresses; class 6, medical problems with depressed mood; class 7, recent crises with
criminal legal problems; class 8, IP problems with recent crises; and class 9, suspected of alcohol use at time of death.
cDiagnoses are listed for those identified as having a current MH condition. Most of these decedents (93.9%) were classified in the first 3 classes; therefore,
diagnoses were provided for only these classes. There were 2457 decedents in class 1, 4070 decedents in class 2, and 7073 decedents in class 3 who had current
MH conditions. Diagnoses could have been listed as either the primary diagnosis or the secondary diagnosis. Decedents could have multiple diagnoses;
therefore, diagnostic categories are not mutually exclusive.
dOther residential areas include shelters and prisons. Transport areas include public highways, streets or roads, or inside a motor vehicle.

classes 7 and 8. These findings suggest that there might
be a need for services that help build strong coping skills
to better handle relationship issues during times of cri-
ses, especially because a high proportion of the class 7
decedents perpetrated interpersonal violence prior to
death. Furthermore, a high proportion of class 7 dece-
dents had criminal legal problems, indicating that the
court/legal system might be in a position to act as a gate-
way for multicomponent suicide and violence preven-
tion strategies. Such strategies can incorporate indi-
vidual counseling with family therapy, counseling on
building positive relationships and coping skills, and as-
sistance with accessing additional resources that can help
reduce stress on relationships (eg, employment assis-
tance programs).38
Similar to Flensborg-Madsen et al,39 we also found that
alcohol-related problems can be common among sui-
cide decedents in the absence of psychiatric comorbid-
ity, as indicated by classes 5 and 9. Alcohol-related prob-
lems were the most transparent characteristics for these
decedents. Both of these classes had moderate probabili-
ties for being identified as having a sad or depressed mood,
which could mean they had MH problems that were not
yet diagnosed. The class 5 decedents had moderately high
probabilities for having a recent crisis and other life stress-
ors, suggesting that these decedents might have been using
alcohol as a coping device, which warrants efforts to re-
duce this maladaptive coping behavior in favor of more
socially adaptive ways of dealing with stress.
The link between medical illness and depression with
suicide in older adults is well documented.40-42 This study
found that class 6 decedents (those with contributing
medical problems) mostly comprised older adults. Nearly
half of them were identified as having a depressed mood,
which indicates a need for increasing social support and
MH screening and treatment once diagnosed as having
a severe or terminal medical condition. Class 6 deaths
were also characterized by the highest proportion of wid-
owed, divorced, or separated decedents and more than
double the number of decedents with prior military ser-
vice than any other class, both of which may indicate the
need for additional support systems.
In light of these findings, many limitations of this study
should be considered. First, the NVDRS data were not
nationally representative. As the NVDRS expands to in-
clude all 50 states, the class structure, the class propor-
tions, or both might change over time. Second, changes
in class proportions over time might be a reflection of
changes in the population demographic characteristics,
which signifies that scientists must continue to observe
patterns of risk factors if they hope to help prevent sui-
cide. Third, the reported information on MH and medi-
cal health problems and substance abuse was obtained
from coroners and medical examiners, family members,
and friends of the victims. As such, it may be incom-
plete based on the knowledge level of the informant. Fur-
thermore, many of these decedents might have been liv-
ing with MH conditions but never received a diagnosis.
Because of the potential underdiagnosis of MH condi-
tions, the proportion of decedents placed in classes 4
through 9 might have been overestimated and the pro-
portion estimates for classes 1 through 3 might have been
underestimated. Fourth, 5 states had to be excluded be-
cause of lack of circumstance information. The ex-
cluded population did not largely differ from the study
population by demographic characteristics such as race/
ethnicity, sex, and age (significant differences were de-
tected because large populations were compared, but the
differences were slight); therefore, potential biases asso-
ciated with population demographic characteristics were
most likely minimal. However, our findings should still
be generalized only to the population of the 12 NVDRS
states included in the study. The fact that 5 states were
excluded because of the lack of suicide circumstance in-
formation signifies the need for thorough reporting on
suicide deaths by medicolegal death investigators to ap-
propriately monitor suicide trends. Lastly, LCA can of-
ten lead to subjective interpretation of class patterns; how-
ever, the victim demographic and mechanism or weapon
characteristics we observed across the classes were simi-
lar to the correlations observed in previous research. These
characteristics helped validate the existence of the pat-
terns we identified. More research is still needed to help
understand why different populations are drawn into dif-
ferent patterns of risk factors for suicide.
Suicide is a complex problem that is typically precipi-
tated by a variety of circumstances. With the use of LCA,
this study identified patterns of known risk factors among
decedents, which can hopefully provide more direction
on how to develop or combine prevention efforts. For
ongoing suicide mortality surveillance initiatives, this type
of analysis also provides a more accurate and compre-
hensive picture of the surrounding circumstances expe-
rienced by suicide decedents. In this study, the com-
mon theme across most classes of decedents was a need
for more connected medical, MH, substance abuse, court,
and social services; one service alone might not suffi-
ciently prevent this problem. Furthermore, all dece-
dents needed more social support, even those who were
currently receiving MH counseling or treatment. Initia-
tives that recruit family, friends, and community mem-
bers to help those experiencing high levels of mental
and/or life stress might further help prevent suicide.
