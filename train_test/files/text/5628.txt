Abstract. In the well-known gamut expansion effect, uniformly coloured target patches are perceived
as more colourful when they are embedded in a uniform grey surround than when they are embedded
in a variegated one. Here, we provide a demonstration showing that this effect can be inverted when
the uniformly coloured target patches are replaced by variegated ones. This observation suggests
that the gamut expansion effect is due to mechanisms of transparency perception rather than due to
contrast adaptation.
Keywords: simultaneous colour contrast, gamut expansion effect, perceptual transparency, colour scission,
perceptual organization.
The two top panels of Figure 1 show a variant of Brown and MacLeod's (1997) gamut expansion
effect. The six squares embedded in the patterned surround on the right are physically identical to
those embedded in the uniform surround on the left, yet the latter appear more colourful. The four
chromatic targets look more saturated, and the two achromatic ones on the top appear as more pro-
nounced shades of white and black. Regarded as points in three-dimensional colour space, the per-
ceived colours of the targets in the uniform surround are all shifted in the direction away from the
intermediate grey of the surrounds.
The gamut expansion effect has stirred much interest because it clearly violates traditional laws of
simultaneous contrast. According to the "complementarity law" of simultaneous colour contrast, the
surround induces a shift in the perceived colour of the target, which is complementary to the colour
of the surround. That is, the vector in colour space representing the colour shift should have a direc-
tion opposite to the vector from the grey point to the surround colour (Figure 2a). Furthermore, the
direction of the colour shift should be the same for targets of any colour, as long as the colour of the
surround is fixed. Figure 2(b) schematically illustrates the kind of colour changes typically observed
in investigations of the gamut expansion effect (Brown & MacLeod, 1997; Ekroll & Faul, 2013; Faul,
Ekroll, & Wendt, 2008). The observation that the perceived colours of the targets in the uniform grey
surround appear more saturated than those in the variegated one, but of the same hue, means that they
are shifted in the directions corresponding to the vectors pointing from the colour of the surround
(which is grey in this case) to the colours of the target. Based on many lines of converging evidence,
we have argued that the latter is a general rule ("direction law"), which holds for surrounds of arbitrary
colour (not just grey ones; see Figures 2b and c), and is characteristic not only of the gamut expansion
effect but also of the classical simultaneous contrast effect (Ekroll & Faul, 2012a, 2012b).
Traditional explanations of simultaneous colour contrast appeal to mechanisms providing col-
our constancy across illumination changes (Helmholtz, 1866/1962; Lotto & Purves, 2000; Walraven,
Benzschawel, & Rogowitz, 1987). When the colour of the illumination changes in a given direction
in colour space, the colour of the light reflected from objects in the scene typically change in roughly
the same direction and any visual mechanism that shifts the object colours in the opposite ("comple-
mentary") direction would counteract the influence of the illumination and thus provide approximate
colour constancy. Thus, presuming that the visual system uses the colour of the surround as a cue to the

colour of the illumination, this kind of mechanism can be expected to produce a simultaneous contrast
effect that is complementary to the colour of the surround. However, if the simultaneous contrast
effect actually obeys the direction law rather than the complementarity law, this traditional explanation
would seem less plausible, suggesting that an alternative theoretical account is needed.
Figure 1. In the top panels, the perceived difference between the target patches is more pronounced in the uniform
surround (a) than in the variegated surround (b). In the lower panels, the converse is true. Here, the target patches
in the variegated surround (c) appear (in a qualitatively similar way) more different than the physically identical
ones shown in the uniform surround (d). Together, the classical gamut expansion effect (top) and the inverted one
(bottom) suggest that the compatibility with a perceptual interpretation in terms of transparency, which is given
in the left panels, but not in the right ones, is the crucial determinant of the effect. The demonstration should
preferably be viewed on-screen for optimal colour reproduction.

Figure 2. (a) According to the traditional complementarity law, the direction of the perceived colour shifts
(arrows) induced by a coloured surround is opposite to the direction given by the vector point from the grey point
to the colour of the surround. (b) The colour shifts observed in the gamut expansion effect exhibit a different
pattern. Here, the targets in the uniform grey surround appear more saturated than those in the non-uniform
surround. This corresponds to colour shifts having the same direction as the vectors from the grey surround to
the targets. (c) According to our theory, the same principle ("direction law") also applies for coloured surrounds.
Addressing this point, we have proposed that the gamut expansion effect (as well as the classical
simultaneous contrast effect) is instead due to mechanisms subserving the perception of transparent
media (Ekroll & Faul, 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Faul et al., 2008). As illustrated in Figure 3, a uniformly
coloured disc embedded in a uniformly coloured surround (Figure 3a) is compatible with the percep-
tual interpretation of a transparent disc in front of a uniformly coloured background (Figure 3b). If the
perceptual system makes this interpretation, and infers the colour of the transparent disc based on the
colour-mixture equations underlying Metelli's model of perceptual transparency (Gerbino, in press;
Metelli, 1985), then the inferred colour of a disc embedded in a grey surround should be more satu-
rated than its proximal colour.According to Metelli's equations, the perceived colour E of the transpar-
ent disc is related to the proximal colour P of the disc and the proximal colour B of the surround by the
equation P = B + (1 - )E, where 0 <  < 1 is the perceived transmittance of the transparent disc.
Intuitively, this equation means that the proximal colour P is located on the line segment connecting
the colours B and E in colour space. Hence, if B is an achromatic colour, the proximal colour P of the
disc is always less saturated than its inferred layer colour E. Importantly, though, this enhancement
of perceived saturation should only occur when the stimulus is compatible with perceptual transpar-
ency. Since the structure of the background will generally be visible through a transparent object (see
Figures 3c­d), a centre-surround stimulus should only be compatible with transparency of the central
patch if the central patch and the surround exhibit compatible patterning (or a compatible lack of
patterning). That is, a uniform target is compatible with transparency only when the surround is also
uniform. If the surround is non-uniform, transparency would only be a viable solution if the target is
also non-uniform (as in Figure 1c or Figures 3c­d). Thus, according to our theory, the gamut expan-
sion effect (top panels of Figure 1) results because the uniform targets can be interpreted as transparent
when they are embedded in the uniform surround (Figure 1a) but not when they are embedded in the
non-uniform surround (Figure 1b).
The results reported in Ekroll and Faul (2013) lend strong support to this explanation of the gamut
expansion effect. A further interesting prediction of this theory, though, is that it should be possible
to invert the gamut expansion effect by using non-uniform target squares rather than uniform ones.
The demonstration shown at the bottom of Figure 1 suggests that this is indeed the case. Here, the six
squares embedded in the uniform surround (Figure 1d), each composed of two differently coloured
rectangles, are physically identical to those embedded in the variegated surround (Figure 1c). In this
case, the target squares embedded in the non-uniform surround appear more different from each other
than the ones embedded in the uniform surround, rather than the other way around, as was the case
with the uniform target squares (Figures 3a­b). Thus, as predicted by our theory, the crucial variable
determining which targets look more saturated is not the contrast of the surround, but the compatibility
with a perceptual interpretation in terms of perceptual transparency.
Judging colours of the square targets in the bottom panels of Figure 1 is somewhat complicated
by the fact that each square consists of two differently coloured rectangles rather than a single colour.
It is particularly difficult to judge the colour of the squares on the right, since no common transparent
Inverting the gamut expansion effect 331
layer is perceived in the square region corresponding to the two rectangles. Thus, whether the squares
in Figure 1(c) actually look more saturated than those in Figure 1(d) will, to some extent, depend on
what one regards as "the" colour of the two rectangles--which clearly also requires some mental
construal. It is comparatively straightforward, however, to compare the colours of the transparent
squares in Figure 1(c) with the uniform squares in Figure 1(b). Although the average colour within
each square in Figure 1(c) is identical to the colour of the corresponding square in Figure 1(b), the
squares in Figure 1(c) appear more saturated, which cannot be attributed to contrast adaptation, since
the two surrounds are identical.
Historically, the simple centre-surround stimuli shown in Figure 3(a) and the slightly more com-
plex stimuli shown in Figure 3(c) are strongly associated with two separate research traditions pursu-
ing different goals with different strategies. The former kind of stimulus has been extensively used
within the tradition of sensory psychophysics, which aims to study simple low-level mechanisms by
eliminating or at least minimizing the influence of perceptual organization. The latter kind of stimulus,
on the other hand, was preferred within the tradition of Gestalt psychology (Fuchs, 1923; Metelli,
1985), which aims to reveal the role of perceptual organization by using stimuli containing sufficient
structure for doing so (Gerbino, in press, Wagemans et al., 2012a, 2012b). Modern approaches typi-
cally appeal to both lines of reasoning within a theoretical framework postulating multiple levels of
visual processing (Adelson, 2000; Kingdom, 2003). While the idea of multiple levels of processing
Figure 3. (a)Auniformly coloured target disc embedded in a uniformly coloured surround (a) can be interpreted
as a transparent disc in front of a uniformly coloured background (b). Traditional research on perceptual
transparency, however, has focused on the slightly more complex stimuli shown in (c), which can be interpreted
as a transparent disc in front of a non-uniform background. Reproduced from Ekroll & Faul, (2013) by kind

seems quite plausible, there is no a priori justification for the widespread assumption that simpler
stimuli engage less complex visual mechanisms than more complex stimuli do. As our analysis sug-
gests, the very simple stimulus in Figure 1(a) may engage the same kind of comparatively complex
visual processing as the more complex stimulus in Figure 1(c). Thus, the well-documented influence
of perceptual organization and layered scene representation on colour appearance (Anderson, in press;
Wollschläger & Anderson, 2009) may even play a crucial role in simple centre-surround stimuli. From
this perspective, it appears less surprising that the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast evoked by
these deceivingly simple stimuli has defied any simple and consistent explanation for more than a
century (Shevell, 1978; Whittle, 2002).
