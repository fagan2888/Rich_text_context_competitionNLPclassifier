Abstract
This paper shows that the substantial disparity in German bank lending towards industrial (IC)
and non-industrial (Non-IC) countries is largely explained by differences in countries'
endowments and only to a minor extent by German banks' different treatment of these country
groups. This is demonstrated by applying a decomposition technique to an augmented gravity
model that is estimated for German foreign lending using a new micro panel data-set on
individual claims from the Deutsche Bundesbank covering the period from 1996 to 2002.

Non technical summary
In theory, capital flows provide risk sharing opportunities for both debtors and creditors and can
enhance economic efficiency. In practice, however, capital inflows can rapidly turn into capital
outflows thereby creating economic instability or even financial crises, especially in developing
countries.
Broadly speaking, capital flows can be divided into foreign direct investment, portfolio
investment, and bank lending. While bank lending has lost in importance as a source of finance in
the 1990s as compared to the 1970s or 1980s, it still amounts to about 20 percent of capital
inflows. As German banks are among the major creditors to industrial as well as developing
countries, their lending behaviour is of particular interest.
This paper analyses German banks' lending behaviour towards industrial and non-industrial
countries. In particular, the discrepancy in bank lending to these two country groups is explained
as about 85 percent is directed to industrial and only about 15 percent to non-industrial countries.
The analysis is conduced in two steps. First, the determinants of German bank lending are
estimated using a gravity model positing that claims depend positively on recipient countries'
economic size and negatively on the distance to Germany as well as other factors. Second, the
lending gap between IC and Non-IC countries is decomposed into one part stemming from
differences in countries' endowments and one part that results from German banks' different
treatment of these country groups with respect to their fundamentals.
The findings are that market size proxies, distance from Germany, foreign direct investment and
country risk explain most of the variation in German foreign claims. With respect to the lending
gap between IC and Non-IC countries, it turns out that differences in countries' factor
endowments explain more than two thirds of this gap, while less than one third is unexplained
and hence due to different treatment of countries' fundamentals and a residual of unobserved
factors.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Aus theoretischer Sicht bieten internationale Kapitalflüsse sowohl für Kreditnehmer als auch
Kreditgeber die Möglichkeit, Risiken besser zu streuen und die ökonomische Effizienz zu
steigern. In der Realität können Kapitalzuflüsse sich jedoch schnell in Kapitalabflüsse
verwandeln und somit zu Instabilität oder sogar Finanzkrisen beitragen.
Im Allgemeinen kann man Kapitalflüsse in Direktinvestitionen, Portfolioinvestitionen und
Bankkredite unterteilen. Wenngleich Bankkredite in den 90er Jahren im Vergleich zu den 70er
und 80er Jahren an Bedeutung verloren haben, machen sie immer noch etwa 20 Prozent aller
Kapitalzuflüsse aus. Da die deutschen Banken zu den größten Kreditgebern weltweit gehören, ist
ihr Kreditvergabeverhalten von besonderem Interesse.
In diesem Papier wird die Kreditvergabe deutscher Banken an Industrie- und Nicht-
Industrieländer analysiert. Insbesondere wird das Ziel verfolgt, die Diskrepanz in der
Kreditvergabe an diese beiden Ländergruppen, 85 Prozent aller Kredite gehen an Industrieländer
und lediglich 15 Prozent an Nicht-Industrieländer, zu erklären.
Das Vorgehen unterteilt sich in zwei Schritte. Zunächst werden die Determinanten der deutschen
Kreditvergabe unter Verwendung eines Gravitätsmodells geschätzt. Aus dem Modell lässt sich
ableiten, dass die Kreditvergabe unter anderem positiv von der wirtschaftlichen Größe eines
Nehmerlandes und negativ von der Distanz zu Deutschland abhängt. Anschließend wird der
Unterschied in der Kreditvergabe zwischen Industrie- und Nicht-Industrieländern in zwei
Komponenten zerlegt, nämlich in einen ersten Teil, der sich durch unterschiedliche
Fundamentalfaktoren in den Ländergruppen erklären lässt, und einen zweiten, der sich auf
unterschiedliche Behandlung dieser Fundamentalfaktoren zurückführen lässt.
Es zeigt sich, dass Marktgröße, Distanz zu Deutschland, Direktinvestitionen deutscher Firmen
sowie das Länderrisiko der Nehmerländer die Variation in der deutschen Kreditvergabe fast
komplett erklären. Die Diskrepanz in der Kreditvergabe an Industrie- und Nicht-Industrieländer
lässt sich zu mehr als zwei Dritteln auf Unterschiede in den eben genannten Fundamentalfaktoren
zurückführen, während ein Drittel unerklärt bleibt und somit von unterschiedlicher Behandlung
der Fundamentalfaktoren sowie einem Residuum an unbeobachteten Faktoren stammt.

German bank lending to industrial and non-industrial countries:
Driven by fundamentals or different treatment?#*
1 Motivation
Capital mobility can help investors diversify portfolio risk and can enable borrowers to stimulate
economic growth and smooth their consumption paths.1 While it is commonly believed that
freely moving capital among industrial countries enhances economic efficiency and thus
increases total welfare, the positive impact of increased capital mobility for developing countries
is still a subject of debate in the literature.2 Proponents maintain that relaxing constraints on
capital flows leads to a more efficient allocation of resources in developing countries, stimulating
economic growth and enhancing economic well-being. Opponents emphasise that capital flows
may result in higher economic instability and vulnerability to crises.3 To understand the
determinants of capital flows and their volatility has thus been an aim of empirical studies.4
The focus in this paper is on the determinants of one specific form of capital, namely German
bank lending, and on one aspect of instability that arises from banks treating countries as a group
rather than as individual countries. In theory, claims to different country groups such as industrial
(IC) and non-industrial countries (Non-IC) may either deviate because countries in these groups
differ with respect to their characteristics (e.g. market size) or because characteristics are treated
differently, i.e. market size is valued differently depending on whether a country belongs to the
IC or Non-IC country group. As is well known, banks have regional limits for their exposures in

place and it is thus of interest to know how different groups of countries are treated when banks
invest internationally.5
In particular, I will analyse the reasons for the disparate lending behaviour of German banks
towards IC and Non-IC countries from 1996 to 2002.6 I proceed in two steps: First, the
determinants of German bank lending are estimated using an augmented gravity model. Second,
the estimated gravity model is used to decompose the lending gap between industrial and non-
industrial countries in a "characteristics" and a "treatment" effect.
The paper thus contributes to the literature in two ways: Firstly, by estimating a gravity equation
for German bank lending using a new micro panel data-set and secondly by applying the Oaxaca
(1973) decomposition technique to the gravity model, which has not yet been done. With respect
to the discrepancy in lending towards IC and Non-IC countries, this technique makes it possible
to calculate the share of the lending difference due to countries' endowments and the share
stemming from unequal treatment of IC and Non-IC countries, respectively.
The findings of the paper can be summarized as follows: The gravity model shows that market
size proxies, distance from Germany, foreign direct investment and country risk account for 80
percent of the variation in German bank loans. With respect to the lending gap between IC and
Non-IC countries, I find that differences in countries' factor endowments explain more than two
thirds of this gap, while less than one third is unexplained and hence due to different treatment of
countries' fundamentals and a residual of unobserved factors.
The paper is structured as follows. First, I review the literature relevant to the study in Section 2.
Following this, the empirical methodology applied in the paper will be outlined in Section 3.
5 Calvo et al. (1996) posit for instance that "the Mexican crisis of late 1994 tended to make the attitude of investors
toward emerging markets more discriminating". Note, however, that it is not the aim of this paper to stress the
impact of outstanding events, but rather to study treatment of country groups in general.
6 This question is also related to the Lucas Paradox, i.e. why capital does not flow from rich to poor countries.
However, as I do not have data on net German bank lending (inflows minus outflows) but only on German foreign
bank lending, my results do not provide an explanation of the Lucas Paradox in the strict sense as outlined in Lucas
(1990).
3
Subsequently, I describe the data sources and some stylised facts about banks' foreign exposures
in Sections 4, while results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.
2 Review of the literature
As German bank lending is the focus of this study, I will briefly put it into perspective. Broadly
speaking, private capital flows can be divided into foreign direct investment, equity or bond
flows and bank lending.7 Albeit bank lending has decreased in importance as a source of capital
inflows in the last decade as compared to the 1970s and 1980s, it still accounts for about 20-30
percent of capital inflows to emerging markets and its high volatility has been an issue of
ongoing concern.8 With regard to the importance of German bank lending in international bank
lending, it should be noted that German banks have been among the largest creditors to emerging
markets in the last decade and account, at par with the US, for about 15-20 percent of all
international bank claims.9
Due to the impact of capital flows on countries' development and economic well being,
numerous empirical studies have been conducted to understand foreign direct investment
patterns, equity and bond flows as well as international banks' lending behaviour.
7 Each form has specific benefits and drawbacks. Prasad et al. (2003) show that FDI flows are for instance much less
volatile than other capital flows. See also Reisen and Soto (2001) who analyse the relationship between different
types of capital flows and economic growth.
8 In the 1970s, capital flows mainly comprised bank lending. This was attributable to bank deposits stemming from
OPEC countries' current account surpluses (see Chadha and Folkerts-Landau, 1999). In the 1980s, however, bank
lending declined dramatically as world interest rates rose and a severe debt crisis affected many developing
countries. In contrast, the early 1990s are characterised by a surge of private capital flows. The financial crises in
Mexico (1994), Asia (1997) and Russia (1998) are mirrored by a high volatility in portfolio flows and bank lending,
while FDI flows have steadily increased. See e.g. Alfaro et al. (2005) for a review of capital flows from 1970 and
2000.

An approach often used for analysing international capital movements is to estimate a gravity
model.10 The basic idea behind a gravity model is related to physics and the fact that
"gravitational attraction between two bodies depends upon the mass of each body and the
distance separating them".11 As attrition in physics, certain frictions will, however, impede the
exchange in goods or capital.12 As a consequence, the gravity model has been augmented to
control for different sources of frictions in international capital flows.13
The gravity model, albeit initially an empirical approach, has been deduced from a variety of
economic theories on goods and asset trade, respectively. Concerning the volume of trade, for
instance Helpman (1998, p. 24) derives an equation in which the volume of trade depends
positively on the trading partners' GDP levels. Martin and Rey (2004) specify a theoretical model
to analyse the determinants of asset flows from which the gravity equation emerges.14 Buch
(2000) outlines a portfolio model suggesting that excess returns, market size and risks determine
foreign lending activities of commercial banks.
As this paper applies an augmented gravity model to analyse German bank lending, three recent
papers using gravity models to explain bank lending are related to the present paper. First, Rose
and Spiegel (2004) estimate a gravity model in the context of sovereign default using bank claims
as dependent variable. Their analysis is based on the hypothesis that trade sanctions imply a
severe penalty following a country's default. Hence, they expect creditors with larger bilateral
trade flows to have a comparative advantage in bank lending as their power to penalize is ceteris
paribus higher. Using the "Consolidated Banking Statistics" provided by the Bank for
10 This methodology dates back to Tinbergen (1962) and Pöyhönen (1963), who estimated a gravity model for trade
flows.
11 See Baldwin (1994, p. 119). In the context of this paper, the gravity equation postulates that bank lending between
Germany and other countries depends on countries' economic size and information costs.
12 On this issue, Tinbergen (1962, p. 265) writes: "Apart from purely economic variables it is likely that political or
semi-political factors play a part in determining the volume of trade between countries".
13 Rose (2000) for instance estimates a gravity model for bilateral trade controlling for currency unions, an issue also
dating back to Tinbergen's (1962, p. 265) study, in which he controlled for "the existence of special trade
agreements" by including a specific dummy variable to measure this effect.
14 Strictly speaking, their equation depends on financial wealth, aggregate consumption, transaction costs as well as
the expected return of assets (see Martin and Rey, 2004, p. 352). For assets such as equities, financial wealth is
proxied in empirical applications by stock market capitalisation, see e.g. Portes and Rey (1999). For bank lending,
the volume of GDP seems more appropriate (see Buch and Lipponer (2004) or Papaioannou (2005)).
5
International Settlements (BIS), they find a statistically and economically significant impact of
trade flows on bank lending.15
Papaioannou (2005) estimates a gravity model using the "Locational Banking Statistics", a
different data source from the BIS.16 Instead of analysing stocks of claims as Rose and Spiegel
(2004), this author looks at currency adjusted lending flows. This study, covering flows of BIS
reporting countries and their respective debtors from 1984 to 2002, stresses the importance of
institutional quality for bank lending.17 The results point to a positive and significant as well as
robust impact of institutional quality on the size of absolute bank flows.
Also related to the present study is a paper by Buch and Lipponer (2004) using a gravity model to
analyse a) which German banks go abroad and b) whether banks enter new markets via
subsidiaries (FDI) or via cross-border financial services.18 They find that larger GDP and bilateral
trade flows are positively linked to German banking activities abroad, while distance exerts a
negative impact.19
15 A major problem of their paper is, however, whether the observed relationship is in fact due to comparative
advantage in penalizing sovereign defaults. An impact of trade on lending may also occur for a variety of other
reasons. Among a number of reasons put forward in a paper by Wright (2004), one obvious channel between trade
flows and bank lending exists because banks offer trade credits and hence countries with high bilateral trading
volumes also have larger bank claims on each other.
16 Note that both data-sets (Consolidated Banking Statistics and Locational Banking Statistics) have advantages and
disadvantages. While the Consolidated Banking Statistics data takes for instance lending between banks at home and
their subsidiaries abroad into account, there is no adjustment for changes in stocks of claims due to currency
changes. The Locational Banking Statistics, on the other hand, provides flow data adjusted for currency fluctuations
but does not control for intra-bank lending. For more information on the different BIS data sources see Wooldridge
(2002).
17 For an analysis of the impact of institutional quality on stock returns in emerging markets see Bilson et al. (2002).
Alfaro et al. (2003) emphasize the role of institutions when explaining the Lucas Paradox. See Political Risk Services
Group (2003) for a description of the index.
18 Cross-border financial services are defined as the sum of bank premiums and interest rate returns paid and
received. FDI is defined as claim from a German bank to its foreign affiliate. Their analysis is based on data from the
Deutsche Bundesbank and hence only one creditor country, Germany, and its activities abroad is subject of the
analysis in their as well as in this paper.
19 It should be noted that the data used in our paper, albeit also stemming from the Bundesbank, differs from Buch
and Lipponer (2004) in two respects: Firstly, we use the stock of foreign claims, i.e. the volume of outstanding
claims, rather than the volume of premiums and interest payments on these claims as dependent variable. Premiums
and Interest rate payments are defined as the volume of claims multiplied with claim specific premiums and interest
rates, respectively. Secondly, we concentrate on consolidated claims for the largest 15 banks instead of claims for all
banks, as consolidated data is not available for all banks. These 15 banks account for 75 percent of all consolidated
claims. Our data stem from the Department for Banking and Financial Supervision. As we consolidated the data
ourselves, we limited the coverage of banks due to time constraints to the largest banks in German foreign lending.

3 Empirical methodology
The empirical part of the paper is divided into two sections. In the first section, an augmented
gravity model along the lines of Buch and Lipponer (2004), Rose and Spiegel (2004) and
Papaioannou (2005) is estimated. In the second part, the mean difference in claims towards
industrial and non-industrial countries is decomposed into an "explained" and an "unexplained"
part by applying a technique proposed in Oaxaca (1973) including an extension suggested in Yun
(2003).
3.1 The augmented gravity model
The gravity model takes the following form:20
Ln(claimsb,c,t
) = c +  *ln(gdpc,t
)+ ß* ln(distc
) +  ln(fdic,t
) +  *ln(riskc,t
)
+  *mcc,t
+ µb
+ µc
+ µt
+ b,c,t
where subscript b stands for creditor bank, c for the receiving country and t for time (year).
The dependent variable is:
- Ln (claimsb,c,t
): Log of real claims (stock) from bank b to country c in year t
The set of regressors21 include:
- Ln(gdpc,t
): Log of real GDP of country c in year t
- Ln(distc
): Log of distance of country c from Germany
- Ln(fdic,t
): Log of real FDI (stock) from Germany in country c in year t
- Ln(riskc,t
): Log of an index for country risk (combining political, economic as well as
financial risk) of country c in year t
- Mcc,t
: Stock market capitalisation in % of GDP of country c in year t
20 All variables are denominated in Euro or have been converted to Euro as described in Table 1 (Appendix).
7
Note that the data-set exhibits three dimensions and thus three unobserved effects may exist:
Bank [µb
], country [µc
] and time [µt
] specific effects. The error term b,c,t
is assumed to have a
mean of zero as well as a constant variance.
I estimate this model using cluster regression, i.e. a general version of the random effects
model.22 The baseline specification includes bank and time dummies to control for µb
and µt
. .
Controlling for µc
is, however, not fully possible as including country dummies takes away all
explanatory power of the regressors.23 This can be seen by looking at Table 3, which exhibits an
analysis of variance of the variables across groups (defined as bank*country) and time (year).
Note that the variance of the regressors (Xit
) for the pooled data is by construction the sum of the
between group variance and the within group variance. As can be seen, there is hardly any
variation of the data across time. Instead, most of the variation in the data stems from variation
across groups, i.e. bank country combinations, as shown by the similarity of between group
variation and pooled variation. Estimating a fixed effects model therefore does a priori not make
sense as the variation within groups is very small.
A standard random effects estimation is also not desirable due to the possible presence of
heteroscedasticity which may stem from the fact that the regressors take on the same value for
each bank. For example: GDP for Argentina in 1996 is the same for Deutsche Bank as well as
Dresdner Bank and all other banks, so is the value for country risk, FDI and market
capitalization.24 In other words, the explanatory variables only vary across country and time,
resulting in a violation of the assumption that errors are independently distributed. Instead, errors
may systematically depend on specific groups, i.e. countries. This problem has been called the
21 See Table 1 for sources and exact definitions of variables.
22 This is done using STATA 8. For details on cluster regression see e.g. Manual [U], pp. 270.
23 This will be shown in a regression in Section 4.
24 Note that distance only varies across country and not time.
8
"Moulton Problem" in the literature.25 The problem is solved by estimating cluster regressions,
where the country dimension is defined as cluster.26
A common concern in regression analysis is endogeneity of the regressors with respect to the
dependent variable resulting in a correlation of the explanatory variable with the error term and
thus inconsistent estimates of the ß coefficients. In the gravity model estimated, endogeneity is,
however, not a major concern as we use individual bank data. It is unlikely that German bank
lending significantly influences the right hand side variables such as GDP, FDI, country risk or
market capitalization.
Choice of variables
The determinants of German foreign lending in this paper include the "usual" gravity factors such
as GDP and distance as proxies for market size and information costs. As additional controls, the
stock of FDI, an index covering political, economic and financial country risk in the borrower
country as well as stock market capitalisation in percent of GDP in debtor countries are included
in the baseline specification. The model is estimated for the full sample as well as separately for
IC and non-IC countries. We expect the following effects of the explanatory variables:
GDP: GDP is commonly used in gravity models as a proxy for market size. As I only analyse
bank lending from Germany to other countries, I only include the recipient country's GDP. On
the one hand, larger claims are ceteris paribus demanded to finance expenditures and on the other
hand, German banks face more opportunities to invest, which results in a larger supply of credit.
Hence, I expect a positive coefficient on GDP.
Distance: A priori, the effect of distance is ambiguous. Albeit most empirical studies such Portes
and Rey (1999), Rose and Spiegel (2004) or Papaioannou (2005) find a negative impact of
distance on capital flows or asset holdings, a positive effect of distance can be rationalised from a
25 See Moulton (1986). Unadjusted standard errors may exhibit a large bias downwards implying the danger of
spurious regression. The problem arises if errors are correlated within groups. In our case, a group is country.
26 Note that standard errors estimated with a cluster regression are also "robust", i.e. cluster takes serial correlation as
well as heteroscedasticity into account.
9
portfolio point of view. While the former effect is explained by rising information costs in
countries situated further away, the latter effect can be rationalised by deceasing business cycle
correlations in more distant countries and thus an opportunity to diversify a bank's portfolio (see
Buch, 1999).27
FDI: In the baseline regression, I include the stock of German FDI instead of trade flows because
it is a stock variable as the dependent variable. Intuitively, as banks finance part of companies'
FDI, countries receiving ceteris paribus more FDI from German companies are expected to
receive higher claims than others, i.e. German banks follow their customers abroad (see Buch,
2000). Furthermore, banks may follow FDI also due to better information about the country
gained from financing FDI or even from the knowledge of German companies abroad.28
Country risk: Concerning the index for country risk, which includes for instance countries'
government stability and democratic accountability as proxies for political risk, inflation and
current account deficit as economic variables, or short term debt as financial risk, among others,
we expect a positive coefficient: Countries with lower country risk (i.e. larger value of the
variable) receive ceteris paribus more foreign claims. Several studies have recently explored the
effect of country risk on capital flows.29
Market capitalisation: Finally, stock market capitalisation in percent of GDP is included to
proxy for the size of countries' financial markets as in Buch and Lipponer (2004) and Portes and
Rey (1999). It is, however, an empirical question whether market capitalisation exerts a positive
or negative impact on German banks' foreign assets: A larger financial market implies more
demand for loans as well as opportunities to invest and can thus be considered an additional
proxy for market size. However, a high ratio of market capitalisation to GDP might also mirror a
27 Note that Tinbergen (1962, p. 263) pointed out that distance would not only proxy for transportation but also for
information costs. Portes and Rey (1999) find that the coefficient of distance drops when including other measures of
information asymmetries implying that distance indeed is a proxy for information costs. Note, however, that distance
in this paper not only proxies information but to some extent for physical transport costs as long as banks are
financing foreign trade (see Buch, 1999).
28 Note that German FDI is positively and distance negatively correlated with Germany's bilateral trade flows and
thus both variables capture trade financing activities of German banks to some extend.
29 See e.g. Alfaro et al. (2005) and Papaioannou (2005).
10
market-based in contrast to a bank-based system and thus a ceteris paribus lower demand for
foreign claims if these are considered as substitutes rather than complements.30
3.2 The decomposition analysis
With respect to the literature on decomposition analysis it should be noted that there is, according
to my best knowledge, no study that has applied this technique in the context of either gravity
models for trade flows or international bank lending. The technique, initially introduced by
Oaxaca (1973), allows to decompose the mean difference of the dependent variable (the average
difference in claims to IC and Non-IC countries) into a part stemming from different
characteristics (such as market size, distance etc.), i.e. an "explained part" and an "unexplained
part" stemming from different ß-coefficients obtained in separate regressions for IC and Non-IC
countries.31
The technique, albeit initially used to decompose wage differentials between men and women or
public and private sector employees, is not confined to this subject area but can be applied in
other areas as well.32 Examples include Ham, Svejnar and Terrell (1998) who study
unemployment duration, Moore and Newman (1988) focusing on American post-war trade union
membership or Heitmueller (2004) analysing job mobility between England and Scotland.
In the present paper, the mean difference in bank claims towards industrial and non-industrial
countries can thus be decomposed into an explained as well as an unexplained part. I first
estimate the augmented gravity model for the two respective groups, industrial and non-industrial
countries.

30 Traditionally, financial sectors are described either as market-based or bank based systems, respectively. See
Levine (2002) for an economic assessment of the two types across countries. Note that this distinction is not only an
issue for industrial countries but also for developing countries. Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1996) show for
instance that bank and equity finance are rather complements than substitutes in developing countries.
31 If omission of variables is not a concern, this part reflects unequal treatment of IC and Non-IC countries.

with Y, a vector (n x 1) of the dependent variable (ln_claims), X, a matrix (n x k) of regressors, ß,
a vector (k x 1) of coefficients, and an error term,  (n x 1). After estimating (1) for each group,
the set of estimated ß-coefficients can be used to predict the average claim of each group g:33

The difference in predicted average claims can be written as:

explained unexplained
Thus, holding everything else constant and taking the same ß-coefficients for both groups,
differences in countries' endowments result in a difference in average (log) claims of magnitude
"explained". The second term named unexplained is the difference between the estimated slope
coefficients (i.e., ßs) for IC and Non-IC countries weighted by the average level of characteristics
of Non-IC countries.35 Thus, ceteris paribus, the weighted difference in ß-coefficients results in a
mean difference of the dependent variable of magnitude "unexplained".
33 Y (1 x 1) is the mean of the dependent variable, X is a row vector (1 x k) of means of the explanatory variables
and ß a column vector (k x 1) of estimated coefficients from (1).

Having decomposed the difference, we know how much is explained by disparities in countries'
fundamentals and how much is unexplained and thus due to different behaviour (shown in
different ß-coefficients) of German banks with respect to industrial and non-industrial countries,
respectively.
Hence, the findings shed light on the question why bank lending from Germany to IC and Non-IC
countries differs. However, these are aggregate figures and we do not know yet which of the
regressors and coefficients, respectively, contributes how much to this difference.
Further insights can be obtained from a detailed decomposition of the difference in the means of
the dependent variable. For each explanatory variable and for each ß-coefficient one can compute
its share of the total explained and unexplained part, respectively.

Thus, Explainedj
represents the fraction of the explained difference in (4) due to differences in
the jth mean characteristic. Take country risk as an example: Because IC and Non-IC countries
have different average values of country risk, the difference in mean (log) outstanding claims is
of magnitude Explainedj
. Similarly, Unexplainedj
is the part of the unexplained component in
equation (4) that is due to differences in the jth ß-coefficient, e.g. a different ß-coefficient of the
variable country risk, weighted by the average country risk in Non-IC countries.36
36 Note that an identification problem has to be taken into account with respect to the detailed decomposition of the
coefficients effect for dummy variables. As a matter of fact, the detailed coefficients effect is sensitive to the left out
reference group (see e.g. Oaxaca and Ransom 1999). Yun (2003) proposes a solution to the problem that was applied
in the paper. As we apply decomposition to an OLS regression, the formulas can be directly applied as shown in Yun
(2003, p. 8).

Possible Caveats of decomposition analysis
Before turning to the data sources and results, I discuss some potential caveats when applying
decomposition analysis. First, some coefficients might turn out significant for one group but not
for the other, which is not taken into account by the analysis (see Moore and Newman, 1988). In
our study, however, this will not pose a large problem as most coefficients are at least almost
significant for both samples. Second, some variables a priori only matter for one group but not
the other: A dummy variable for EU membership would take the value zero for all Non-IC
countries prior to 2004 and hence cannot be estimated. In this paper, we encounter outliers that
could be controlled for by dummy variables and an interaction term, however only for the Non-
IC sample. The dummy as well as the interaction term cannot be estimated for the IC sample and
therefore need to be excluded, which is dissatisfactory to some extent. Third, an identification
problem exists with respect to dummy variables, i.e. the estimated detailed coefficients effect
(equation 6) attributed to a dummy variable depends on the choice of the left-out reference group
(see Oaxaca and Ransom, 1999). To take an example, the coefficient effect of a time dummy
concerning two time periods, e.g. 1999 and 2000, depends on whether 1999 or 2000 is included
in the regression. Despite the fact that we are not interested in a particular dummy variable in this
study (we only include time and bank dummies), we take this problem into account by applying a
correction suggested in Yun (2003). The correction approximates the "true" contribution of
individual dummy variables to the difference in claims by averaging the estimates with various
reference groups (in the example above, the "true" coefficient effect is the average of one
regression with a dummy for 1999 and one with a dummy for 2000 included in the regression).
Fourth, as we need to make predictions of the dependent variable in the decomposition analysis,
a high R2 is desirable (see Bender 2003). Thus, in the context of this paper, it is desirable to
explain a large fraction of the variance in foreign bank claims. As gravity models generally
explain a large fraction of the dependent variable, in our case around 80%, this is not a serious
14
concern in the present study. Fifth, as out of sample predictions are needed to decompose the
difference in average claims, we need to assume that the variables enter the model in the same
functional form in IC as well as Non-IC country regressions. I use the standard functional form
suggested in the literature on gravity models for capital flows and thus this issue raises no major
concern in this study.37 As none of the other caveats has raised serious concerns, decomposition
analysis for the gravity model on bank claims can be performed.
4 Data sources
Dependent Variable: The data on foreign claims of German banks, which I use in this paper, are
collected in the credit register of three million Deutsche Mark or more at the Deutsche
Bundesbank. German credit institutions are required to report all claims which have exceeded the
threshold of 1.5 million at the end of each quarter.38 To obtain an adequate measure of banks'
total credit exposure, the data has been adjusted in several ways.39
The sample includes 15 German banks and their foreign subsidiaries covering 75 percent of total
unconsolidated exposure of German banks from 1996 to 2002.40 Hence, the maximum sample
size is 6195 observations, i.e. 15 banks' exposures to 59 countries from 1996 to 2002.41
37 If this were not the case, a pooling of the two country groups would not be possible at all, even if one would
control for different intercepts and slope coefficients. While it makes sense that the impact of a variable varies with
its level (e.g. decreasing importance of country size taken account of by including GDP in logarithmic form), there is
no a priori reason why e.g. GDP should have a larger effect on Non-IC country lending provided other factors such
country risk etc. are controlled for.
38 Claims include on- and off-balance sheet activities. Off-balance-sheet items include derivatives (other than written
option positions), guarantees assumed in respect of these, and other off-balance-sheet transactions (Deutsche
Bundesbank, 1998). The following items are deemed not to be credit exposures: shares in other enterprises
irrespective of how they are shown in the balance sheet and securities in the trading portfolio.
39 First, we consolidated all foreign claims to exclude inter-office positions between a head institution and its foreign
subsidiaries. Second, we subtracted publicly guaranteed claims from total claims to obtain a more accurate measure
of banks' effective foreign exposure to credit risk. Hence, in comparison to other data sources the Bundesbank data
allow a much better calculation of banks' credit exposures. However, there are also some important shortcomings.
There are no data available on valuation changes (for example write-downs of non-performing loans, currency
composition). Furthermore, we have no information on banks' indirect exposures via their lending to other
commercial entities such as hedge funds. See Nestmann et al. (2004) for a detailed description and a descriptive
analysis of the data-set.
40 Banks included are listed in Appendix I. For a detailed overview of the German banking system see Brunner et al.
(2004), Krahnen and Schmidt (2004), Koetter et. al. (2004) and Sachverständigenrat (2004).
41 As not every bank has an exposure in all countries at all times, 5276 exposures show up in the data-set, with 3215
observations reported in Non-IC countries and 2061 in IC countries.
15
Explanatory variables: The explanatory variables included in the regression analysis mainly stem
from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Other sources are the Direction of
Trade Statistics from the International Monetary Fund as well as the International Capital Links
Statistics of Deutsche Bundesbank.
Some stylised Facts
Some stylised facts on German bank lending will now be highlighted. Table 2a shows total
claims by region for the period 1996 to 2002. Worth noting is the following: First, total claims to
IC countries are about 8 times larger in 1996 and about 11 times larger in 2002 than claims to
Non-IC countries, i.e. the gap between lending to IC and Non-IC countries has widened over
time. Second, Asia, Western Hemisphere and Emerging Europe receive the largest shares of
lending to Non-IC countries, while exposure to Middle East and Africa is comparatively low.42
Third, while claims to Asia have remained more or less constant, claims to Emerging Europe,
Western Hemisphere and Industrial countries have constantly been rising from year to year.43
Table 2b exhibits the average annual exposure of large commercial as well as Land banks from
1996 to 2002. As can be seen, the United States and the United Kingdom receive by far the
largest amount of German bank lending, followed by France and the Netherlands. Non-IC
countries obtaining large amounts of German credit are Brazil, Poland, Korea and Russia. About
twenty out of the 59 countries in our sample receive less than 1 Billion Euro per year with
Bolivia, Paraguay and Namibia each obtaining less than 100 Million Euro. It should be noted that
there is, however, a considerable variation of claims within IC and Non-IC countries,
respectively.
42 Note that I use the regional classification of the IMF. Countries belong to Industrial countries, Asia, Africa, Middle
East, Western Hemisphere or Emerging Europe.
43 Note that claims to Asia rose before the Asian crisis in 1997 and fell back to its pre-crisis level afterwards. The
Russian crisis cannot be seen in the data, possibly because I use yearly averages of stocks of claims. Western
Hemisphere's exposure decreased after the crisis in Argentina in 2001.

5 Results
In this section, the gravity model is estimated and tested for sensitivity. Afterwards, the
decomposition analysis will be carried out in Section 5.2 using the estimates of the baseline
gravity equation obtained in Section 5.1.
5.1 Results from estimating the augmented gravity model
German bank lending can be analysed using a gravity model as described in Section 3.44 It posits
that bank lending depends positively on GDP, German companies' FDI, country risk as well as
market capitalization in debtor countries and negatively on distance from Germany.45 Table 5a
shows the results from estimating the baseline specification.

In regression (1), all variables have the expected sign and are significant at the one percent level.
Due to the fact that the dependent as well as all explanatory variables (apart from market
capitalization) are expressed in logarithms, we can interpret each ß-coefficient as elasticity. For
44 With respect to the variables included in the baseline specification it should be noted that overlaps between IC and
Non-IC countries exist for all variables.

17
instance, concerning the impact of market size on bank lending, we observe that a one percent
higher GDP leads on average to 0.76 percent higher claims. Geographical distance has the
expected negative sign implying that countries further away from Germany obtain ceteris paribus
less bank lending. Note also that countries which host ceteris paribus more German FDI also
obtain a larger amount of foreign claims and that a 1 percent lower country risk index induces a 4
percent larger amount of claims. Finally, if the average market capitalization to GDP ratio is one
percent higher, bank lending rises by 0.2 percent.46 As is common to gravity models, the variation
of the dependent variable is well explained by the variation in the explanatory variables, as
shown by the R2 value of 78 percent.
Columns (2) and (3) from Table 5a show the baseline regression estimated separately for the two
groups focused on in this paper. The results are qualitatively similar to (1), i.e. coefficients have
the same sign. Concerning the magnitude, however, some differences stand out: Distance is not
different from zero for non-industrial countries, while it is negative and significant for the IC
sample. This should, however, not be interpreted as if information costs do not play a role in bank
lending to Non-IC countries. As mentioned above, the benefits of diversification may cancel
increased information costs out and therefore result in a neutral impact of distance on bank
lending (see Buch, 1999). Concerning country risk, the coefficient for IC countries is not
significant and slightly lower than for Non-IC countries. FDI and market capitalisation have
almost the same coefficient in both samples.
I test the sensitivity of the baseline regression in several ways. First, I estimated the baseline
using claims adjusted for currency fluctuations (Table 5b). Second, I estimate the gravity model
allowing for other structures of the error term as well as with and without outliers, respectively
(Table 5c). Third, I check the sensitivity with respect to different time periods as well as
aggregated over all time periods (Table 5d). Fourth, I add banks' total assets as a bank specific
variable to the baseline specification (Table 5e). Fifth, I apply a Tobit regression to the gravity
46 Note that in the Log-Lin specification, the elasticity of Y (Dependent variable) with respect to X (Regressor)
depends on the value of X. Here we evaluate the elasticity of Y with respect to X at the mean of mc, i.e. we multiply
the average value of mc with the ß-coefficient (52*0.004).
18
model (Table 6a). Finally, I include several control variables, thereby testing their impact on the
dependent as well as interactions with regressors (Tables 6b and 6c).
Concerning all these additional regressions, I find that the coefficients of the baseline regression
remain almost unchanged and that none of the added covariates appears to have a significant
impact on German bank lending. To save space, regressions are only shown and described in
Appendix IV.
5.2 Results from the decomposition analysis
To explore the issue of lending discrepancies between IC and non-IC countries, I apply the
decomposition technique introduced by Oaxaca (1973). This will shed light on the question why
Non­IC countries receive significantly less foreign bank lending than IC countries. As a matter of
fact, the mean difference between IC and Non-IC countries can be decomposed into an explained
part (due to differences in Xs) and an unexplained part (due to differences in ß-coefficients) as
shown in Section 3. Now take a closer look at Table 8 to obtain an idea of the magnitude of the
explained and unexplained part, respectively.

19
The overall difference in predicted average lending (in logs) between the two groups is about 2.8.
Regardless of the weighting scheme (ß=ßIC
or ß=ßNIC
), most of the differential in (log) mean
loans is accounted for by differences in countries' characteristics. As can be seen, between 63 and
76 percent of this discrepancy are due to differing characteristics, i.e. means of the explanatory
variables, while about 24 to 37 percent stem from differences in coefficient values which were
estimated in separate regressions for IC and Non-IC countries. In other words, because the two
groups have different average levels of GDP, distance to Germany, FDI from German companies,
country risk and market capitalization as percentage of GDP, the average value of claims in non-
IC countries is lower than in IC countries.47 It is worth noting that all figures have to be
interpreted ceteris paribus, i.e. everything else constant, the difference in (log) lending due to the
characteristics effect would be between 1.8 to 2.1, while the coefficient effect ceteris paribus
induces a mean difference in (log) lending between 0.7 and 1.0.48
Since we are particularly interested in the composition of the explained and unexplained part, we
also perform a detailed decomposition of the average difference in bank loans.

time and bank effects, respectively. Only some time and dummy variables are significant.
47 Note that time as well as bank dummies are included but not shown. They contribute to the explained and
unexplained part, as will be seen in the detailed decomposition further below.
48 Since the explained and the unexplained parts are positive, their adding up increases the average difference.
However, this needs not to be the case. If, on the contrary, the unexplained part would e.g. be negative, explained
and unexplained part would balance each other out, i.e. a difference in characteristics would be compensated by a
difference in coefficients. See e.g. Moore and Newman (1988).
20
Table 9 shows the results. Clearly, differences in GDP account for the largest fraction of the
explained part: The differences in GDP would, ceteris paribus, increase the gap of (log) claims
between 0.85 and 0.99. With respect to another proxy for market size, mc, we only observe a low
predicted (log) difference in claims between IC and non-IC countries of about 0.14. Additionally,
the fact that Non-IC countries are further away from Germany, receive less FDI and have on
average a lower country risk index, would ceteris paribus lead to a (log) discrepancy in bank
lending of 0.1 to 0.3, 0.43 to 0.48 and 0.35 to 0.40, respectively, depending on the weighting
scheme. Note that all estimates have been tested for their significance using bootstrap confidence
intervals.49 For the explained part, all gaps are significant at the 1% level. To summarise: Per
capita GDP, FDI and country risk account for most of the observed differences in bank lending.
Besides the explained part, the overall difference in claims is due to different ß-coefficients in the
regressions for IC and Non-IC countries as well as the constant term. The second and forth
column of Table 9 show for both weighting schemes the implied gaps in average loans that
would, ceteris paribus, exist. Note that the constant term reflects characteristics that have not
been captured by the regressors included in the model. Albeit the constant term is rather large in
absolute size, it is not statistically significantly different from zero. The only significant
difference in ß-coefficients concerns the country risk variable. In other words, it appears that
banks treat country risk in both groups not in the same way. Some caution with this interpretation
should be noted as country risk was not significant in the regression for IC countries and we
omitted three countries from the Non-IC sample.50 All other coefficient effects are not
statistically different from zero. Thus, treatment between the two groups does not seem to be the
driving force for the differences in German bank lending to IC and Non-IC countries.
49 See Efron and Tibshirani (1993) for details. The procedure can be illustrated as follows: 1000 samples of size N
are drawn from the original data-set with replacement. For each sample, all statistics are re-estimated to derive
standard errors and confidence intervals. Note that three different types of confidence intervals have been computed:
The normal (N), the percentile (P) and the bias corrected (BC) which are similar if the bootstrap statistic is
approximately normal. This is the case for all variables shown in Table 9. For further details see Stata7 Manual [A-
G, p. 168].
50 The countries are Indonesia, Russia and Turkey. Hence, this is only a conclusion that can be drawn for the
countries in the sample.
21
6 Summary and conclusion
This paper explores the differences in average German bank lending to industrialised and non-
industrial countries. This is done in two steps: First, I estimate an augmented gravity model for
German bank lending including "gravity" factors such as GDP and distance. The augmenting
factors are FDI of German companies, country risk and market capitalization in percent of GDP.
The gravity model explains a large part of variation in German bank lending. It also provides the
basis for the decomposition analysis which sheds light on the lending gap between lending to IC
and Non-IC countries. The gap is decomposed into an explained part due to countries'
endowments and an unexplained part due to different treatment of IC and Non-IC countries by
German banks.
The results suggest that German bank lending is to a large extent allocated according to
countries' fundamentals and different treatment of IC and Non-IC countries as groups appears
comparatively small.
I thus conclude that IC and Non-IC countries are treated to a large extent in the same way and
that being allocated to one group or the other should only be a minor concern. More importantly,
improving country fundamentals, e.g. attracting more FDI, will lead to an increase in bank
claims, no matter what group a country "belongs" to.
In future research it would be interesting to test whether this result also holds for other definitions
of country groups (e.g. sub-groups of developing countries such as Western Hemisphere,
Emerging Europe etc.) and whether it can be sustained for a larger group of lenders, e.g. by using
data from the Bank for International Settlements.51
51 Note that BIS data is aggregated on the country level. Thus while the behaviour of more countries can be analysed,
this comes at the cost that no information on individual banks is available.

IV Additional Regression results
Table 5b. Baseline specification: Adjustment for currency fluctuation
Table 5b reports the results for currency adjusted foreign claims. Note that the stock of claims from one year
to another may rise or fall either due to an actual rise or fall in claims or due to a valuation effect induced by a
change in the exchange rate, as part of claims are denominated in Dollar and other currencies but have to be
reported in Euro to the Bundesbank. Unfortunately, I do not know the currency composition of each claim but
only of the aggregate of German banks. Thus, the adjustment is only an approximation for the true change in
claims due to changes in exchange rates (For further details on the adjustment of claims see Nestmann et al. ,
2004). Note that the results hardly change. The sample is slightly smaller as data on the currency composition
is not available for Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Costa Rica and Uruguay.

33
Table 5c: Baseline Specification: Outliers
In Table 5c the gravity model is estimated allowing for different structures of the error term: In regression
(1) an interaction between country and time is set as cluster, i.e. the variance covariance matrix allows for
an arbitrary heteroscedasticity structure across this dimension. Note that t-values have increased
significantly pointing to the Moulton problem. In column (2) we include country dummies next to time and
bank dummies. Note that none of our variables is significant any more. This is not surprising as variables
do mainly vary across countries (see Table 3). Hence, including a dummy variable for each country leaves
no more explanatory power for the regressors. The following two regressions show that country risk is
valued differently for three outliers, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. In Regression (4) we observe an
insignificant effect of country risk on bank lending. This surprising result is due to the impact of these
outliers. Therefore we created a dummy variable for these three outliers ("geo") as well as an interaction
term between "geo" and country risk in regression (5). It turns out that country risk indeed has a positive
and significant impact on lending to non-industrial countries in general. For the three countries of
geopolitical importance, however, it appears that a decrease of 1 percent of country risk even leads to a
slight increase of 0.6 percent (2.5-3.1) in loans. This may be rationalised by the geopolitical importance of
these countries overcompensating a low score of country risk. It should be noted that albeit the three
countries obtain a significant share of all claims to non-industrial countries, our analysis remains valid for
most of German bank lending.

Table 5d: Baseline Specification: Different time periods
In Table 5d I estimate the baseline specification for different time periods as well as aggregated over all
time periods. Regression (1) is performed for the period including the Asian and Russian financial crises,
while regressions (2) and (3) present the estimates for the post crises period. Coefficients hardly change at
all which again mirrors the low variability of the data across time and the large variation across countries,
respectively. This is further supported by regression (4) in which variables have been averaged over time
but coefficients remain rather stable. Obviously, the number of observations drops sharply as the sample
now consists at most of 15 banks and 59 countries, i.e. 885 observations instead of 6195. I nevertheless
keep the time dimension for the sensitivity checks as some covariates might vary more over time than
variables in the baseline specification.

In Table 5e I control for bank size next to bank dummy variables in the regression The data set consists of
individual bank data and banks' size might be correlated with lending behaviour. Larger banks might for
instance have a different portfolio structures than smaller banks. Columns (1) to (3) include the logarithm
of banks' total assets (ln_size). It should be noted that the sample only consists of 15 banks and thus
variation is not as large as for a full sample of all German banks including savings and cooperative banks.
As neither savings nor cooperative banks are engaged to a large extend in foreign lending, they are
excluded. However, neither the coefficients and their significance levels nor the overall explanatory power
of the regression change in comparison to Table 5a. As variation of banks' assets is low over time, all that
changes is the constant and the dummy variables for banks. As bank size does not represent a country
specific endowment, I do not include it in the decomposition analysis of the next section. Note that the
results of the decomposition analysis including bank size can be obtained from the author upon request. As
in the regression, only the constant as well as bank dummy variables change in the decomposition analysis.

Table 6 a. Tobit Regression
The following regressions in Table 6a are concerned with the estimation technique applied. One problem
that needs to be taken into account is that banks only report claims above 1.5 million Euro. Thus, a bank
that does not report an exposure in fact has outstanding claims between zero and 1.5 Million Euro. This
information is, however, not included in the original reports to the Bundesbank leading a priori to an
unbalanced data-set. I therefore augment the data-set and fill in 1 where no claim is reported. In the
augmented dataset, we have data on claims of 15 banks on 59 countries from 1996 to 2002, i.e.
15*59*7=6195 observations. Missing values of other variables limit the sample size to 4935. Note that the
amount of missing values is comparatively low as we only analyse the largest German banks and most of
them have had exposures in almost all markets at all times considered. For IC countries, 40 exposures are
missing, for non-IC countries, 467 observations are needed to balance the data-set. In Tobit regression, a
Maximum Likelihood estimation combining linear regression and a Probit analysis, I define values equal
and below zero as censored. Table 6a shows the results of estimating regressions (1)-(3) of table 5a using
Tobit regressions. All variables keep the expected sign and remain significant in all three regressions. Note
that the magnitude of coefficients cannot be directly compared to the Cluster regressions in Table 5. The
coefficients of Tobit regressions can be interpreted in the following way: The effect of a change in the ith
explanatory variable on the dependent variable (ln_claims) can be divided into a) the change of those
claims above the limit (1.5 mn) weighted by the probability of being above the limit (1.5 mn); and b) the
change in the probability of being above the limit (1.5 mn), weighted by the expected value of claims
above the limit (1.5 mn) [See Mc Donald and Moffitt (1980, p.318)].

Table 6b. Additional covariates (1)
In Table 6b I first run regressions (1)-(3) including macroeconomic variables such as inflation, budget
balance and current account (both in percent of GDP). Note that the coefficients of the other variables
hardly change and the interpretation is the same as in Table 5a. In the following two regressions I include
the prevailing exchange rate regime of country i at time t to the list of regressors. This can be rationalised
by a preference for low exchange rate volatility outweighing the increased risk of sharp devaluations
(Papaioannou (2005, p. 30). While column (4) includes the exchange rate classification of Reinhart and
Rogoff (2004), (5) contains the classification of Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003). In Reinhart and
Rogoff (2004), a large number is associated with more flexible exchange rate regimes, while it is the other
way round in the classification by Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003). Note that both papers provide a
fine and coarse classification: For Reinhard and Rogoff (2004) the fine classification contains 15 categories
and the coarse classification 5 categories, while Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003) provide a five and a
three way classification. Both classifications are downloadable from the Internet. Regressions (4) and (5)
use the fine classification, respectively. Results for the coarse classifications are similar but not shown. For
definition of the classification system see Table 1 in the Appendix. The variables for exchange rate regimes
are neither in (4) nor in (5) significantly different from zero. Thus, either the exchange rate regime is not a
determinant for German bank lending or positive and negative effects of regimes cancel each other out.

Table 6c. Additional covariates (2)
In Table 6c I include the logarithm of bilateral exports instead of FDI. Exports and FDI are highly
correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.78) and can therefore not be included simultaneously. We note that
exports are, however, not significant. Note that Buch and Lipponer (2004) find a positive and significant
impact of trade in their study. The result in the present study appears to stem from the negative correlation
with distance (-0.56) as leaving distance out of the regression turns exports significant. As exports are
flows and not stocks such as FDI in this paper, I opt for FDI in all further specifications. The lending rate
included in column (2) is not significant. This may be due to the fact that stocks of claims are analysed
which depend less on interest rate differentials than flows of claims (I thank Claudia Buch for this
comment). Including average years of schooling, the rate of inflation as well as an indicator for the
disclosure requirements and another one for the toughness of banking supervisors abroad does not change
the picture (I thank Alexander Lipponer for providing the data on the indices for transparency and banking
supervision).
