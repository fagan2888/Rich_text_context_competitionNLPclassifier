Article
The age period from late teens through the 20s has become
widely recognized as emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000;
Buhl & Lanz, 2007). Emerging adulthood is distinguished
from adolescence and young adulthood in terms of demogra-
phy, that is, a great deal of change and diversity in living situ-
ation, education/work-related issues, and partnership
arrangements; a sense of ambiguity in the perceived develop-
mental status; optimistic views on one's own future possi-
bilities; and prolonged identity exploration (Arnett, 2000,
2006). The period appears in societies that postpone an indi-
vidual's entry into adult roles and responsibilities, particu-
larly in postindustrial societies that emphasize the role of
education, professional training, individual choice, and per-
sonal independence (Arnett, 1998, 2000). Along with rapid
economic and social changes in those societies, traditional
views on adulthood stressing adult role transitions seem to
have been replaced in their importance by more individualis-
tic conceptions (Arnett, 2001).
Conceptions of the Transition Into
Adulthood
Research examining individuals' conceptions of the transi-
tion into adulthood was initially conducted in the United
States (Arnett, 1998, 2001, 2003). To investigate how
adulthood is viewed, Arnett constructed a list of criteria for
adulthood drawn from sociological, anthropological, and
psychological perspectives. The items were theoretically
organized into the categories of Independence, Family
Capacities, Norm Compliance, Interdependence, Role
Transitions, Biological Transitions, and Legal/Chronological
Transitions (Arnett, 2001, 2003). The list (hereinafter called
Arnett list) has been widely used in North American studies
(e.g., Arnett, 2001, 2003; Cheah & Nelson, 2004; Cheah,
Trinder, & Gokavi, 2010) and a growing body of research
using the instrument has been performed in a variety of
European countries (e.g., Macek, Bejcek, & Vanickovà,
2007; Nelson, 2009; Puklek Levpuscek & Zupancic, 2010;
Sirsch, Dreher, Mayr, & Willinger, 2009), Argentina (Facio
& Micocci, 2003), Israel (Mayseless & Scharf, 2003), China
(Badger, Nelson, & McNamara Barry, 2006), and India
(Seiter & Nelson, 2011).

Abstract
This study investigated perceptions of achieved criteria for adulthood (ACA) among emerging adult student samples from
Austria (n = 210), Slovenia (n = 201), and the United States (n = 225). Controlling for parental education, students' age
(18-27 years), and gender, we aimed to explain between- and within-sample differences in the ACA by taking the students'
living situation, intimate relationship status, and expectations about their future perspectives into account. The participants
indicated the ACA on the questionnaire based on criteria for reaching adulthood used in studies of adulthood conceptions.
The students also provided information about when they think they will start the first full-time career, get married, gain
financial independence, and become a parent. The Europeans indicated less ACA than the Americans; 20% of the variance in
the ACA was, along with the country effect, explained by the intimate relationship status and future perspectives.

The findings obtained by the Arnett list across Western
type societies (Arnett, 2001; Cheah et al., 2010; Macek et al.,
2007; Nelson, 2009; Puklek Levpuscek & Zupancic, 2010;
Sirsch et al., 2009; Townshend, Gallaway, Friedlmeier,
Puklek Levpuscek, & Sirsch, 2009) suggest that taking
responsibility for one's own actions, making decisions,
establishing a relationship with parents as an equal adult, and
financial independence--all aspects of personal indepen-
dence--are viewed to be the most important criteria for
adulthood from perspectives of adolescents, emerging adults,
and adults through midlife. The importance of family capaci-
ties (e.g., capability to support the family), norm compliance
(e.g., driving safely), and interdependence (e.g., making life-
long commitments to others) are also widely stressed,
whereas legal/chronological (e.g., age 18) and biological
transitions (e.g., capability of bearing children) rank rela-
tively low. Although this research suggests that little impor-
tance is attributed to role transitions (e.g., parenthood), an
actual entry into family-related adult roles (Arnett, 2001;
Marcec, 2012), intimate relationships (Reitzle, 2007;
Zupancic, Komidar, & Puklek Levpuscek, 2014), and work-
related transitions (Zupancic et al., 2014) has been shown to
enhance emerging adults' perceived adult status.
Perceived Adult Status and Achieved
Criteria for Adulthood (ACA)
The present study investigated how emerging adults perceive
their adult status in a cross-national perspective. The per-
ceived adult status has been predominantly studied by sim-
ply asking individuals whether they have reached adulthood.
A majority of emerging adults have not responded affirma-
tively but rather viewed themselves in a transition toward
adulthood (e.g., Arnett, 2001, 2003; Badger et al., 2006;
Puklek Levpuscek & Zupancic, 2010; Sirsch et al., 2009).
Accordingly, 78% of the Austrian and 86% of both the
Slovene and the American emerging adult students perceived
themselves in-between an adolescent and an adult (Sirsch &
Bruckner, 2009). However, Kins and Beyers (2010) sug-
gested that the perceived adult status is a multidimensional
construct, which cannot be fully captured by looking for an
answer to a general question. They proposed each of the
dimensions to be tapped separately by using criteria about
the conception of adulthood from the Arnett list, which refer
to distinct conceptual categories such as Independence (e.g.,
not deeply tied to parents emotionally), Interdependence
(e.g., committed to long-term love relationships), and Family
Capacities (e.g., capable of caring for children). In line with
recent research (Kins & Beyers, 2010; Zupancic et al., 2014),
we quantified the concept of the perceived adult status by
using several criteria from the Arnett list in a modified
response format, that is, asking individuals whether they
think that they have fulfilled each of the criteria to gain better
and more specific insights into young peoples'perceptions of
their own adult status.
Using a modified version of the criteria list, Kins and
Beyers (2010) demonstrated that emerging adults' percep-
tions of the achieved criteria for adulthood (ACA) are impor-
tant as individuals'success in theACAis associated with their
subjective well-being. Moreover, an increase in the ACA,
particularly those criteria that refer to independence and inter-
dependence, contributed to a positive change in emerging
adults' well-being over time. Literature in related fields fur-
ther suggests that emerging adults show an increase of well-
being with growing psychosocial maturity (Galambos,
Barker, & Krahn, 2006) and after having successfully accom-
plished developmental tasks concerning autonomy, educa-
tion, work, and intimate relationships (Schulenberg, Bryant,
& O'Malley, 2004; Zupancic et al., 2014).
Only a few studies investigated the ACA (Kins & Beyers,
2010; Nelson, 2009; Puklek Levpuscek & Zupancic, 2010;
Zupancic et al., 2014) but none of them directly evaluated
data across national samples, which would provide a broader
insight into similarities and differences of the emerging
adults' perceived adult status. We compared perceptions of
the ACA among university students in two European coun-
tries (Austria and Slovenia) and the United States (Michigan).
We aimed to include two different European countries (both
EU members) with same historical roots (differing from the
United States) but different socio-economic system in the
recent past. Slovenia as a part of former Yugoslavia under-
went 45 years of so-called soft version of socialism after the
Second World War, which was notably different than in
Eastern European countries and thus, provided the people
much more freedom and ties with the Western world. All
three countries differ in the social-welfare regime, which
may affect the young peoples' pathways to adulthood
(Douglass, 2007). Austria can be characterized as a conser-
vative regime, Slovenia closely resembles the Southern
European regime, and the United States may be placed
within a liberal welfare regime. More importantly, these
modern societies were selected as emerging adulthood is a
general phenomenon of societies characterized by prolonged
education, financial dependence, delay in leaving parental
home, marriage, parenthood, and career start. We already
know that emerging adults in these three countries share sim-
ilar conceptions of adulthood (Townshend et al., 2009). At
the same time, these three modern societies (Austria,
Slovenia, and the United States) differ in average age of
attaining these adult transitions, which may also create dis-
similar pressures as to when and how individuals perceive
themselves as adults. As suggested previously, the adult tran-
sitions appear to shape emerging adults'perceptions of being
an adult (Arnett, 2001; Marcec, 2012; Reitzle, 2007;
Zupancic et al., 2014) in spite of the fact that the individuals
place little importance on these transitions in their conceptu-
alizations of adulthood.
Based on these former findings, we focused on features
that may explain the individuals' perceptions of the ACA
within--as well as between--the national samples. Given
Zupancic et al. 3
that our population of interest was university students, we
included their subjectively expected age of adult transitions
(full-time career, financial independence, marriage, and par-
enthood) instead of actual transitions. In addition, the stu-
dents' living situation and intimate relationship status were
accounted for as further explaining factors of the ACA.
Explanatory Factors of Student
Perceptions of the ACA
Moving out of the parental home and involvement in an inti-
mate relationship are considered important adult transitions,
which positively affect developmental processes necessary
for an individual to reach full adult status (e.g., Buhl, 2008;
Larose & Boivin, 1998). Similarly, young people who antici-
pate fulfillment of personal plans about adult transitions ear-
lier report higher levels of psychosocial maturity (Carroll
et al., 2007; Kalakoski & Nurmi, 1998).
Living Situation
Residing out of the family home may enhance individuals'
attainment of several criteria for adulthood, in particular
those related to personal independence, that is, taking over
responsibilities of everyday life, relying on one's own judg-
ments, gaining financial independence, and restructuring
relationships with parents in terms of relations among equals
(Arnett, 2007; Kins & Beyers, 2010). In contrast, residing
with parents has been suggested to inhibit individuals' inde-
pendence, well-being (White, 2002), achievement of psy-
chosocial maturity, emotional autonomy, and self-reliant
functioning (Beyers & Goossens, 2003; Beyers & Seiffge-
Krenke, 2007; Zupancic et al., 2014). Recent studies also
demonstrate that emerging adults living independently suc-
ceed better in achieving a number of adult criteria than those
residing with parents (Kins & Beyers, 2010; Marcec, 2012;
Puklek Levpuscek & Zupancic, 2010).
We expected that the students living out of their parents'
home would report moreACAthan those residing in the fam-
ily home and that the students' living situation would con-
tribute to both within- and cross-sample variability in the
ACA as the age of moving out varies among the countries of
our inquiry. Austrian males/females leave the parental home
at median ages of 27/25 years, Slovenes at 32/30 years
(Eurostat Press Office, 2009), and Americans at around
26/24 years (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
Intimate Relationship Status
Along with a change in intimate relationships from compan-
ionships and friendships into attachment (Furman & Wehner,
1994), long-term partnerships, more characteristic for emerg-
ing adults than adolescents, lead to changes in connectedness
with parents and to an increase in individuality (Buhl, 2008;
Larose & Boivin, 1998; Masche, 2008). All these changes
may contribute to emerging adults' perceptions of the ACA,
especially due to attainments in the independence (e.g., not
being deeply tied to parents emotionally, establishing a rela-
tionship with parents as an equal adult), interdependence
(long-term love commitment), and norm compliance
domains (e.g., using contraception, having one steady part-
ner only).
Research further suggests that emerging adults who were
involved in an intimate relationship endorsed a greater num-
ber of ACA as compared with their single peers (Kins &
Beyers, 2010; Marcec, 2012; Zupancic et al., 2014). Despite
a postponement of partnership commitments and parenthood
in favor of a single lifestyle, intimate relationships and par-
enthood continue to play an important role in young people's
perceptions of their developmental status (Arnett, 2003; Kins
& Beyers, 2010; Molgat, 2007; Reitzle, 2007). We therefore
expected that students who are involved in a longer lasting
intimate relationship would endorse more ACA than their
single counterparts or those with shorter lasting partnerships;
it was also assumed that potential differences in the relation-
ship status across our samples would contribute to cross-
national variation in the ACA.
Future Plans
In explaining the ACA, we also focused on students' antici-
pated timing of reaching occupational and family-related
goals. Adolescents and emerging adults mainly focus on pro-
ductive (education, career) and reproductive future goals
(marriage, parenthood; Nurmi, 1991; Salmela-Aro, 2001), as
they have relatively detailed conceptions of personal timing of
achieving those goals and anticipate their lives as a sequence
of finishing their education, starting a career, marriage, and
parenthood (Crockett & Bingham, 2000; Nurmi, 2004).
Future-oriented motivation and behavior are channeled
by socio-cultural factors and institutional structures (e.g.,
social expectations, demands, and opportunities), which cre-
ate an opportunity space for individuals' development. In
addition, the individuals actively select their environments
and construct future goals accordingly (Nurmi, 2004). It is
therefore not surprising that the anticipated timing of adult
transitions appears consistent with statistics of the median
ages at which individuals experience the respective transi-
tions (Crockett & Bingham, 2000; Malmberg, 1996) and that
these anticipations predict individuals' behavior before the
transitions (Carroll et al., 2007; Crockett & Bingham, 2000;
Nurmi, 2004). Young people who are closer to an expected
adult transition report higher levels of exploration, commit-
ment, or mature behavior in the respective domain (Carroll et
al., 2007; Kalakoski & Nurmi, 1998). We thus proposed that
the students' expectations of earlier personal transitions (the
first full-time job, financial independence, marriage, and par-
enthood) would contribute to endorsement of more ACA.
Consistent with cross-national differences in the popula-
tion data available for marriage and parenthood, earlier mean
4 SAGE Open
ages of anticipated personal transitions were expected in the
United States (i.e., the state of Michigan) than in Austria and
Slovenia, which may also contribute to the variation in the
ACA among the samples. The median ages of first marriages
for men/women are 27/25 years for Michigan (Michigan
Department of Community Health, 2010), 32.2/29.8 years
for Austria (Statistik Austria, 2014b), and 31.5/29.2 years for
Slovenia (Statistical Yearbook, 2013a). Related to marrying
younger, U.S. women also gave birth at a younger age (25
years in Michigan; Mathews & Hamilton, 2009), compared
with Austria (28.8 years; Statistik Austria, 2014a) and
Slovenia (28.9 years; Statistical Yearbook, 2013b).
Potential Confounding Factors
As individuals gradually make their way to adulthood
(Arnett, 2000, 2001), age effects can be expected for impor-
tant transitions in emerging adulthood (moving out of
home, establishing an intimate relationship), the anticipated
adult transitions (e.g., financial independence, getting mar-
ried), and the overall ACA. The study variables may be fur-
ther confounded with the participants' gender. Females
move out of their parents' home at a younger age (Eurostat
Press Office, 2009) and marry and have the first child ear-
lier than males (Michigan Department of Community
Health, 2010; Statistical Yearbook, 2013; Statistik Austria,
2014a, 2014b), which could contribute to women's earlier
involvement in a long-term intimate relationship and feel-
ing closer to adult transitions as compared with men. The
mean age of adult transitions also varies by social class: A
higher socio-economic class is associated with older ages
of the transitions (Arnett, 2003; Crockett & Bingham, 2000;
Sircelj, 2006).
Study Goals
The goals of this study were to explore cross-national differ-
ences in the student-perceived ACA and to explain between-
as well as within-country differences by variation in students'
living situation, intimate relationship status, and anticipated
age of adult transitions. Controlling for age, gender, and fam-
ily background, two hypotheses were tested: (a) The U.S.
students would endorse more ACA than their European
counterparts; (b) the three study variables would explain
both within- and between-country differences, that is, living
out of parents'home, involvement in an intimate relationship
(including its length), and earlier expectations of achieving
future plans (full-time job, financial independence, marriage,
and parenthood) would contribute to perceptions of having
achieved more criteria for adulthood. We also explored
whether any of the explanatory variables shows a country-
specific relation to the perceived ACA. Due to a lack of
background evidence, we refrained from formulating hypoth-
eses about possible moderating effects of country on the
associations between the study variables and the ACA.
Method
Participants
Students at the State University of Vienna, Austria (n = 210);
the State University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (n = 201); and
Grand Valley State University in Michigan, the United States
(n = 225) participated in this study, which is a part of a
broader project on emerging adulthood in the three countries.
A vast majority of the Europeans took courses in social sci-
ence or humanities (Austria: 94.3%; Slovenia: 88.1%). The
U.S. students were mostly split between the social sciences
(42.8%) and the health sciences (33.3%). The Europeans
were predominantly of Austrian (85%) and Slovene ethnicity
(95%); 84% of the Americans were Caucasian; 7% African;
5% Asian; and 4% were Hispanic/Latino, Native American,
or multiethnic.
The students' mean age was 21.04 years, ranging from 18
to 27 years. There were significant age differences among
the samples, F(2, 632) = 65.30, p < .001: Americans were
significantly younger (M = 20.07, SD = 1.48) than the
Slovenes (M = 21.40, SD = 1.38) and the Austrians (M =
21.72, SD = 1.89). Females predominated across the samples
although the distribution by gender differed among coun-
tries, 2(2) = 18.69, p < .001: The Austrian, Slovene and U.S.
samples included 87.1%, 69.7%, and 78.7% females, respec-
tively. Parents' education was used as a proxy for family
background by calculating the mean of both parents' level of
education (1--secondary/vocational, 2--secondary/aca-
demic, 3--incomplete college education, 4--complete col-
lege education, and 5--postgraduate degree). The education
level differed across the samples, F(2, 631) = 53.22, p <
.001: U.S. parents had a significantly higher level of educa-
tion (M = 3.22, SD = 1.11) than the Slovene parents (M =
2.49, SD = 1.15) and both had significantly higher levels of
education than the Austrian parents (M = 2.11, SD = 1.18).
Procedure
The students were approached in their classes or invited to a
group test by research assistants who provided information of
the purpose of the study, the participants'rights, confidentiality
of the research, and the procedure for completing the question-
naires. The completion of the paper-and-pencil questionnaires
was anonymous and took approximately 45 min.
Instruments
Three questionnaires were relevant for this study. They were
translated from English to German and Slovene and then
back translated. Along with the questions about age, gender,
studymajor,ethnicity,andparents'education,theBackground
Information asked for students' living situation (in or out of
parents' home), current intimate relationship status (single
vs. in a relationship), and length of intimate relationship (1--
in a relationship less than a year, 2--between 1 and 2 years,
Zupancic et al. 5
3--more than 3 years). We created intimate relationship sta-
tus by combining the two latter variables: "0" means "no
relationship" and represents the zero point of the variable.
This quantitative variable contains all participants and we
assumed that the length of relationship is important because
attachment, intimacy, trust, and eventually commitment
develop over time. Furthermore, the qualitative variable
"single vs. in a relationship" neither explained any substan-
tial variance of perceived ACA (p = .28) nor in interaction
with culture (p = .08).
A reduced number of items from the Conception of the
Transition to Adulthood (CTA; Arnett, 2003) were applied in
a modified response version labeled the Achieved Criteria
for Adulthood (ACA). Instead of asking the respondents
about the importance of criteria proposed for reaching adult-
hood (the CTA), the ACA asked the students to indicate
whether they believe they have already reached each of the
criteria in a yes/no response format. The 20 ACA items
included criteria from the Independence (e.g., accept respon-
sibilityfortheconsequencesofyouractions),Interdependence
(e.g., learn always to have good control over your emotions),
Family Capacities (e.g., capable of running a household),
and Norm Compliance (e.g., avoid drunk driving) categories
of the CTA. Due to the respondents' age, student status, the
focus on the perceived ACA, and possible overlap with the
control/explanatory variables, the CTA items belonging to
the Biological, Legal/Chronological, and Role Transitions
categories were omitted entirely. Three other CTA items
were also ignored, namely, those concerning completed edu-
cation, career settlement, and the item "No longer living in
parents' household" as the latter overlaps with one of the
explanatory variables. However, some items that may appear
at first glance to overlap with the explanatory variables (e.g.,
"Committed to a long-term love relationship" and "Capable
of running a household") were retained because they reflect
subjective judgments. For example, one may be engaged in a
relationship without being committed or live out of the
parental home without feeling capable of managing his or
her household properly.
The overall ACA score was defined as the percentage of
"yes" answers to the items and separate item scores were
computed in the same way (Table 1). The internal coherence
of the 20-item overall ACA scores was relatively low (pos-
sibly due to the restricted dichotomous response format) but
still acceptable, with Cronbach's s of .67 in Slovenia, and
.56 in both Austria and the United States. In line with reports

about low internal coherence of the ACA (Kins & Beyers,
2010) or CTA criteria categories (Arnett, 2001, 2003; Sirsch
et al., 2009), and several unsuccessful attempts to replicate
Arnett's conceptually derived categories (see Kins &
Beyers, 2010), our results showed very low s for the cate-
gory-level scores (e.g., from .26 to .32 for Independence).
The category-level scores were thus not considered in the
main analyses.
The Future Plans questionnaire was constructed by the
research team. The rationale of the questions was to get
information about how close/far from the adult transitions
the students view themselves at present. The participants
were asked when they think that they would start their first
full-time career, become financially independent from their
parents, get married, and have a child. The ages were given
in years. "Never" was a further answer option. The overall
score was defined as an average age expected across the four
transitions, with high values indicating later expectations.
Students who reached at least one of the transitions (n = 85)
or answered "never" (n = 81) were excluded; 2.52% of the
total sample (n = 16) started their career, 12.1% (n = 77)
reached financial independence, and 0.90% (n = 6) were
married and had a child. Cronbach's  was satisfactory for
the total sample ( = .82) and within the countries: Austria
(n = 136):  = .83; Slovenia (n = 143):  = .68; the United
States (n = 191):  = .78.
Data Analyses
The analysis was divided into three steps. First, we computed
an ANCOVA with control variables (age, gender, and parent
education) as covariates to test country differences in the
overall perception of the ACA, followed by looking into vari-
ations in specific criteria. Second, we analyzed the country
differences in explanatory variables (living situation, intimate
relationship status, and future plans) by ANOVAs. Third, we
computed two models to test whether the explanatory vari-
ables explain variance of perceived ACA and reduce the vari-
ance explained by country: In the first model, we reanalyzed
country differences--similar to the first analysis--with a
reduced sample size. As the variable Future Plans had miss-
ing/inapplicable values, we tested model 1 with the reduced
sample size (Austria: n = 136, Slovenia: n = 143, the United
States: n = 191) to directly compare with the second model.
The second model included the three explanatory variables to
examine how much between- and within-country variance is
explained by those predictors. We also included interaction
effects between country and explanatory variables to explore
potential country-specific effects of the predictors. Scheffé
tests were applied for all post hoc comparisons.
Results
Analyses of Country Differences in Student
Perceptions of the ACA
A one-way ANCOVA with country as independent variable
and the students' age, gender, and parents' education as
covariates was performed with the entire sample to test for
country differences in the overall ACA. A significant but
small country effect on the ACA scores, F(1, 626) = 6.48, p
< .001, R2 = .020, was obtained (see Figure 1). TheAmericans
perceived themselves as having achieved more criteria (est.
M = 63.79, SE = 1.06) compared with the Slovenes (est. M =
59.99, SE = 1.01) and the Austrians (est. M = 58.51, SE =
1.13). Regarding the covariates, older students scored higher
on the overall ACA than younger ones, F(1, 626) = 20.33, p
< .001, but no significant differences were found by gender,
F(1, 626) = 1.47, p = .19, or parents' education, F(1, 626) =
2.00, p = .16.

Kruskal­Wallis tests for independent samples followed
by Mann­Whitney U tests for single comparisons were
computed at the item level because the variables were not
distributed normally in contrast to the overall ACA score.
The results of the item-level analyses (Table 1) suggested
that the U.S. students scored significantly higher than both
European samples for the criteria of lifelong commitment to
others (in the Interdependence category), capability of car-
ing for children and capability of keeping family physically
safe (the Family Capacities category), and driving safely
and close to the speed limit (the Norm Compliance cate-
gory; see Table 1).
Analyses of Explanatory Variables by Country
Living situation.Significantly more Slovene students (66.3%)
lived in their parents' home as compared with the Austrian
(39.3%) and the U.S. students (39.5%), 2(2) = 39.53, p < .001.
Intimate relationships.Similar portions of the Austrian
(61%), Slovene (58%), and U.S. students (52%) currently
had an intimate partner, 2(2) = 3.74, p = .15, but there
were sample differences in the length of the partnerships,
F(2, 621) = 7.74, p < .005: The Austrians (M = 1.35, SD =
1.26) were involved significantly longer than the Ameri-
cans (M = .97, SD = 1.12), whereas the average length of
relationships of Slovene students (M = 1.22, SD = 1.24)
was in between and did not differ from Austrian and Amer-
ican students.
Future plans.The one-way ANOVA for the overall future
plans yielded a significant main effect of country, F(2, 467) =
81.52, p < .001:American students expected to reach the tran-
sitions significantly earlier (M = 25.17 years, SD = 1.65) than
the Slovene (M = 27.19 years, SD = 2.11) and the Austrian
students (M = 27.73 years, SD = 2.12) who did not differ sig-
nificantly from each other (see Table 2). Separate ANOVAs
were calculated for each future plan and all four analyses
showed a significant country effect: Americans expected to
reach each of the four plans significantly earlier than the Slo-
venes and the Austrians (Table 2). The European groups had
similar expectations except for the career start and the first
child: The Slovenes expected to fulfill these plans somewhat
earlier.
Analyses of Within- and Between-Sample
Differences in Student Perceptions of the ACA by
Explanatory Variables
One-way ANCOVAs were computed to test the impact of liv-
ing situation, intimate relationships, and future plans of reach-
ing the adult transitions on current ACA. Some missing/
inapplicable values regarding future plans reduced the overall
sample size as mentioned in the "Data Analysis" section.
First, we reanalyzed the cross-country effect based on the
reduced sample size (Model 1, Table 3) for a direct compari-
son with Model 2. Then, we included the three explanatory

variables to test their effects on the overall ACA score and
whether this model reduced the variance of the ACA scores
explained by country variations (Model 2, Table 3).
In Model 1, none of the covariates had a significant effect
on the ACA and the significant differences by country were
similar to those obtained with the total sample. The signifi-
cant age effect for the total sample disappeared due to a more
restricted age range of the reduced sample. The overall vari-
ance in the ACA explained was 2.4% and 1.5% of the vari-
ance referring to country differences. The explained variance
is similar to the ANCOVA for the overall sample (2%)
reported above.
In Model 2, the students in an intimate relationship (and a
longer lasting one) attained higher ACA scores, F(1, 435) =
18.25, p < .001, and this effect was further qualified by a
significant interaction, F(6, 435) = 2.80, p = .011. Single
ANOVAs in each of the countries showed that the intimate
relationship and its length had a significant positive effect on
the ACA in Slovenia, F(3, 138) = 15.18, p < .001, and the
United States, F(3, 182) = 8.26, p < .001, but was not signifi-
cant in Austria, F(3, 130) = 1.94, p = .126. Finally, future
plans were significantly related to the ACA, F(1, 435) =
12.41, p < .001: The earlier the students expected to reach the
adult transitions in family- and work-related domains, the
more criteria they perceived attained, r(470) = -.13, p =
.005. However, the results do not preclude associations in the
opposite direction, that is, the students who believe they have
fulfilled more ACA may be more likely to engage in intimate
relationships and feel closer to the adult role transitions.
The explained variance in the ACA increased from 2.4%
(Model 1) to 19.8% after including living situation, intimate
relationship status, and future plans (Model 2). The country
effect became marginally significant, F(2, 435) = 3.01, p =
.051, and the three explanatory variables did not reduce the
country variation as evident from 
p
2 in Model 1 ( 
p
2 =
.015) compared with Model 2 ( 
p
2 = .014).
Discussion
The study examined (a) perceptions of the ACA in university
students from three Western type societies, and (b) between-
and within-country differences in the ACA that could be
explained by the students' living situation, intimate relation-
ship status, and personal future plans about adult transitions,
while controlling for age, gender, and parents' education.
Perceptions of the ACA in the Three Countries
In support to our first hypothesis, the U.S. (Michigan) stu-
dents endorsed more overall ACA than their Austrian and
Slovene counterparts. Country differences in specific ACA
may, in part, provide an insight into those rather small over-
all differences. Relative to the Europeans, more of the U.S.
students viewed themselves as having achieved the criteria
of lifelong commitments to others (belonging to the
interdependence domain) and family capacities related to
keeping family safe and caring for children. The link between
societal and personal expectations can also explain the
advanced ACA scores of the American students. The mean
age of marriage and birth of the first child is systematically
lower in the United States (i.e., the state of Michigan;
Mathews & Hamilton, 2009) compared with Slovenia
(Statistical Yearbook, 2013) and Austria (Statistik Austria,
2014a, 2014b). In line with this societal characteristic, the
American participants also planned to reach these goals ear-
lier than the Europeans. This prospective may indicate
American students' take on more responsibilities (making
long-life commitments, driving safely) or at least illustrates
their perception of being more prepared to take over adult
obligations (caring for one's own family) and thus, consider
themselves as having attained more criteria for adulthood.
The Slovene compared with the Austrian and American
students felt similarly independent although most of the for-
mer lived in the parental household. They seem to counter-
balance: In spite of residing with parents, partly due to a very
short distance separating family home and university and
lower family income (relative to Austria and the United
States; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development, 2012), more Slovene (a majority) than
Austrian and American students reported not being deeply
tied to parents emotionally and scored higher on egalitarian
relationships with parents and independent decision making
in comparison with the Austrians.
Explaining Differences in Student Perceptions of
the ACA
The three study variables (living situation, relationship sta-
tus, future plans) together explained a considerable portion
of within-country variation in student-perceived ACA but
did not account for between-sample differences, which
appeared very modest. The results are partly consistent with
the second hypothesis.
Inconsistent with our expectations based on related
research (Beyers & Goossens, 2003; Beyers & Seiffge-
Krenke, 2007; White, 2002), the students' living situation
(residing with parents or moved out) did not contribute to
their perceptions of ACA. This may be due to the fact that we
treated the "moved out" group of students as a homogeneous
group, which may not be correct. Relative to residing in the
parental home, living in a single household or sharing an
apartment with peers has been shown to decrease the likeli-
hood of feeling an adult in a German emerging adult sample,
whereas cohabitation with a partner increased the partici-
pants' perceptions of being an adult (Reitzle, 2007). If this
was true for our samples, the presumably lower ACA scores
of the students living in a dorm (single) or sharing an apart-
ment could counterbalance the potentially higher scores of
those cohabiting and show no differences in the ACA as
compared with the students residing with parents.
Zupancic et al. 9
The differences in the ACA scores by future plans were
similar across the countries, suggesting that earlier personal
expectations of adult transitions contribute significantly to
the criteria for adulthood the students believed they had
already achieved. However, the relation may run in both
directions: The students expecting the transitions earlier may
put more effort in development of more adult-like behaviors
(Carroll et al., 2007; Kalakoski & Nurmi, 1998) and achieve
more criteria as a consequence. Likewise, the individuals'
perceptions of having fulfilled more criteria for adulthood
may promote their feelings and expectations of being closer
to the adult transitions.
Students' intimate relationship status also contributed to
the interindividual variation in their ACA scores. Along with
related findings (e.g., Kins & Beyers, 2010; Lanz &
Tagliabue, 2007; Reitzle, 2007; Zupancic et al., 2014), our
results suggest that emerging adults' involvement in an inti-
mate relationship appears important to their perception of
becoming an adult in several modern societies. However, the
associations obtained should be viewed bi-directionally due
to the correlational nature of our study. It is similarly plausi-
ble that the students who indicated more ACA feel more pre-
pared to form an intimate relationship, which could increase
the likelihood of their intimate engagements and/or trying to
maintain an already established relationship. In addition, the
significance of the intimate relationship status effect varied
slightly across the countries under our study. Leading a rela-
tionship (including its length) was less reliably associated
with the ACA in the Austrian students compared with the
Slovene and American students. The longer postponement of
marriage in Austria and higher planned age to reach adult
transitions, in particular becoming a parent, by the Austrian
students may create opportunities to consider intimate rela-
tions more as ways of exploration and less as being deter-
mined pathways toward adulthood.
In spite of the impact of future plans and intimate rela-
tionship status on the ACA scores, these effects did not nota-
bly reduce the small country differences in the perceived
ACA, although the differences dropped to marginal signifi-
cance, which may be due to the somewhat smaller number
of students retained in the analyses. Other characteristics
need to be detected to account for the cross-national varia-
tion in the perceived ACA. Countries, for example, differ in
structural conditions (educational systems, employment
opportunities, housing market, social policy, cultural expec-
tations concerning development in emerging adulthood) that
may affect student perceptions of self as an adult (Molgat,
2007). A possible factor could also be that self-enhancement
bias is stronger in the United States than in Europe (Silvera
& Seger, 2004; Tilton Weaver & Kakihara, 2007), and by
this, the Americans may tend to overestimate their ACA. An
alternative explanation refers to differences in societal val-
ues. The higher individualism in the United States compared
with Austria and Slovenia (Schwartz, 2007) cannot serve as
an explanation because the differences in the ACA were
mostly based on criteria related to family capacities and
interdependence, in which the Americans reached a higher
percentage of achievement. Perhaps family values have a
higher relevance for students in the US (Michigan) com-
pared with the Austrian and Slovene students. Beside the
achievement of independence, the focus of the former may
be stronger oriented toward starting their own family--
which happens de facto earlier (see average marriage and
child birth age)--and by this, they may put forth more effort
to make sure they have achieved these capacities. In general,
the assessment of students'individual values (e.g., Schwartz,
2006) could be used to explore between- and within-country
differences in the ACA further.
No differences in the ACA were found for gender, paren-
tal education, and age (with reduced sample size), although
women and young people of less educated parents in general
experience adult transitions earlier than men and individuals
growing up in higher educated families (Arnett, 2003;
Crockett & Bingham, 2000; Eurostat Press Office, 2009;
Sircelj, 2006). It is possible that testing students might erase
the respective group differences as female students and stu-
dents coming from less educated homes may also postpone
the adult transitions for later. This means that gender and
family background differences might occur in older emerg-
ing adults, especially after graduation.
Limitations
The present study was cross-sectional in nature and focused
on university students who represent a relatively homoge-
neous group of emerging adults, who perhaps share a global
student sub-culture. Other same-aged groups may have a dif-
ferent timing of adult criteria achievement and the ACA in
nonstudents may be linked to different factors than those
contributing to the student-perceived ACA. Our respondents
were predominantly female (although the ACA scores were
not affected by gender) and sampled from one university per
country. The generalization of the findings to student popula-
tion in the United States (or even Michigan) is thus, quite
limited; however, the two European samples were selected
from the largest of a few extant universities.
Furthermore, the ACA was assessed by the list of criteria
that were proposed to be relevant for adulthood fromArnett's
work. We only retained the items from the Arnett list that are
relevant to the characteristics of our student samples and
focused on several intrapersonal, interpersonal, family-
related, and rule-abiding criteria for adulthood. Criteria
linked to other domains of attaining an adult identity may
also play a significant role in student perceptions of their
developmental status, for example, those in the area of occu-
pation, ideology, religion, politics, and taking over responsi-
bilities for other societal matters. A qualitative analysis of
freely generated reports on important criteria for adulthood
would provide an answer of whether theArnett list is exhaus-
tive to investigate personal views on the ACA. To extend
10 SAGE Open
knowledge on subjective representations of the ACA, emerg-
ing adults'beliefs about possible hindering or advancing fac-
tors to become an adult may prove beneficial.
Conclusion
Our results indicated that emerging adult students in Austria,
Slovenia, and the United States (Michigan) differ in their
subjectively perceived overall ACA, yet to an apparently
modest degree. The Americans perceived themselves more
adult, particularly due to their perceptions of achievements
in the domain of family capacities, long-term commitments,
and safe driving, in comparison with the European students.
Although the participants' age, gender, parental education,
and living out of parents' home were shown to play a negli-
gible role in their ACA, engagement in an intimate relation-
ship and planning earlier personal transitions in vital life
domains of (re)production were demonstrated to be impor-
tant contributors to within-country differences in the ACA
across the student samples. Nevertheless, those factors did
not provide a noteworthy account for between-country dif-
ferences in the ACA.
In spite of several limitations, our findings add to the
understanding of the emerging adulthood period in individu-
als who continue their education at a tertiary level. The
Austrian and Slovene students'responses were directly com-
pared with those of their U.S. counterparts in Michigan;
instead of looking at the conceptions of adulthood, we
focused on the student-perceived ACA, and plausible demo-
graphic and individual contributors to between- and within-
country variation in student perceptions of their ACA. Data
from more countries and accounting for nonstudents would
allow a country-level analysis, which can offer an insight
into demographical, cultural, and psychological factors con-
tributing to various pathways of becoming an adult in con-
temporary societies.
