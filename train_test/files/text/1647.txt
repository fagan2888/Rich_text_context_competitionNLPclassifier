Abstract
Although noodles occupy an important place in the dietary lives of Americans, up until the present time research and in-depth data on the noodle
consumption patterns of the US population have been very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the food consumption and diet patterns
of noodle consumers and non-consumers according to age, gender, income, and ethnicity. The 2001-2002 NHANES databases were used. The NHANES
2001-2002 data showed that noodle consumers reporting noodle consumption in their 24-h recall were 2,035 individuals (23.3% of total subjects).
According to the results, the mean noodle consumption was 304.1 g/day/person, with 334.3 g for males and 268.0 g for females. By age, the intake
of those in the age range of 9-18 years old ranked highest at 353.0 g, followed by the order of 19-50 year-olds with 333.5 g, 51-70 year-olds
with by 280.4 g, older than 71years old with 252.3 g, and 1-8 year-olds with 221.5 g. By gender, males consumed more noodles than females.
Also, according to income, the intake amount for the middle-income level (PIR 1~1.85) of consumers was highest at 312.5 g. Noodle intake also
showed different patterns by ethnicity in which the "other" ethnic group consumed the most noodles with 366.1 g, followed by, in order, Hispanics
with 318.7 g, Whites with 298.6 g, and Blacks with 289.5 g. After comparing food consumption by dividing the subjects into noodle consumers
and non-consumers, the former was more likely to consume milk, fish, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages while the latter preferred
meat, poultry, bread, and non-alcohol beverages.
Key Words: Noodles, food and diet consumption patterns, NHANES 2001-2002, Americans
Introduction11)
Although they originated in Asia, noodles have become one
of the most popular foods in the United States. Growth in the
domestic food use of wheat has accelerated during the last two
decades and wheat flour is used to produce noodles. The U.S.
market for pasta and noodles increased at a compound annual
growth rate of 6.7% between 2003 and 2008, and the dried
pasta/noodles category led the pasta and noodles market,
accounting for 76.9% [1].
Japanese style (e.g., udon) and Chinese-type noodles (e.g.,
ramen) as well as spaghetti are frequently consumed in restaurants
and at home. However, the effects of noodle consumption on
the diet patterns and eating habits of Americans have not been
studied in detail.
Examining patterns of food group consumption has emerged
as an important focal point for understanding the role of diet
in disease risk [2-4]. Instead of determining single nutrients,
stratifying the food groups is more likely to reflect habitual food
intake, and embody characteristics of the total dietary intake
[2,4,5], and embody characteristics of the total diet, including
all nutrient interactions.
However, in the case of noodles, little is known about noodle
consumption patterns and the contribution that noodle provide
in the American diet. Dietary patterns and food groups reflect
different ethnic eating traditions [5]. Mediterranean and Asian
diets are widely known to incorporate higher intakes of legumes,
fish, vegetables, and fruits, contrasted with the American dietary
pattern consisting of higher intakes of deep-fried fast foods,
refined grains, processed meats, commercially baked products,
and sweets. Understanding these ethnic differences in food group
consumption becomes increasingly significant in the United
States as the US Census Bureau has reported that, from 1990
to 2000, the foreign-born population increased by 57% to
represent 13% of the total US population [6].
Bui and Small [7] analyzed the thiamin contents of white
salted, yellow alkaline, and instant noodles that were
manufactured differently. Fu [8] categorized noodle types by
manufacturing methods and Miskelly [9] studied the historical
aspects of noodles.
Noodle studies have focused on manufacturing methods or
composition analysis, or have been confined to food and cultural

studies, but there is little data on the effects of noodle consumption
on diet and health status [10-28].
This article provides information on current noodle
consumption patterns in the United States and the dietary intake
of noodles by consumers in general. It also offers analyses of
noodle consumers by income, race, and ethnicity. The primary
objective of the research was to gain a better understanding of
noodle consumption in the United States and whether consuming
noodles has a beneficial effect on total diet, in which they may
play a role in healthful eating. The contribution of economic,
social, and demographic factors related to noodle consumption
were examined. The differences in noodle consumption by
income level and ethnic background provide insights into the
factors that affect food selection among these groups. The results
provide useful information for designing food programs and
planning national food supply strategies.
Subjects and Methods
Data and procedures
We used data collected in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 [29], conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Each survey was a stratified,
multistage, national probability sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the United States. The subjects
surveyed in NHANES 2001-2002 were of all ages. All surveys
collected dietary information with the use of a 24-h recall
administered by trained dietary interviewers, and the dietary
recalls collected for the NHANES 2001-2002 survey years used
a computer-assisted dietary interview that included a 4-step
multiple pass approach. In NHANES 2002, the dietary data were
collected using a 5-step multiple pass approach with dietary recall
methods that are part of the integrated US Department of
Agriculture and NHANES protocol "What We Eat in America"
[30].
Identification and classification of noodle consumers
The noodle consumers were identified and classified based on
the intake of noodles consumed in food items. Information from
the NHANES code book was used to identify foods that contained
noodles. Foods containing noodles, spaghetti, macaroni, and pasta
were included. Noodles from other sources (chicken noodle soup,
etc.) were not counted in the selection. The classification of
"noodle consumer" was assigned to individuals who reported
eating noodles during one day, and other individuals were
classified as non-consumers.
The food groups were classified according to USDA food group
classifications and were regrouped as 38 food groups, including
noodles (noodles, macaroni, pasta, spaghetti) (Table 1).
Statistical analysis
We examined the associations between noodle consumption
variables and socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age,
income, and ethnicity. All statistical analyses were adjusted for
the sample weights and the complex sample design of NHANES
by using SAS (release 9.13, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN (release 10.1, Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC) [31]. All data sets were weighted to be
nationally representative and standard errors were calculated by
Taylor linearization variance estimation. Comparison of noodle
consumption by gender was tested using t-tests, and Bonferroni
multiple t-tests were used to analyze the differences in noodle
intake by several ethnicity and income groups. The other ethnic

groups such as "White", "Black", "others" were statistically
compared with Hispanics. The Chi-square test was used to
compare noodle consumption with age, gender, income, and
ethnicity (The result of Chi-square test were not showed in table).
Results
The analysis and results based on the NHANES 2001-2002
data include basic information on noodle consumption as well
as comparisons across other food groups showing the
comparative importance of noodles in the diets of Americans.
Consumption of noodles and comparisons across demographic
groups
To determine the positioning of noodles in the dietary patterns
of Americans, we investigated the vast quantity of consumed food
groups using NHANES data. The NHANES 2001-2002 data
showed that noodle consumers (NC, 23.3%), those who had eaten
noodles on one day of observed data, included 2,035 persons
with 975 (47.9%) males and 1,060 females (52.1%). All others
were classified as non-consumers (noodle non-consumers: NNC,
76.7%).
First, we researched the ranking of noodles for noodle
consumers among the vast quantity intake foodstuffs. When the
average amounts of consumption for the entire age ranges were
considered, the ranking of noodles among the vast quantity intake
foodstuffs was 5th, which included noodles, macaroni, pasta, and
spaghetti. The consumption amount of non-alcoholic beverages
was highest, followed by milk, alcoholic beverages, and fruit
juices, in order (Table 2).
The results of NHANES 2001-2002 showed a total number
of 2,035 individuals consumed noodles during the survey period.
Among them there were 975 males and 1,060 females, indicating
that the noodle consumption frequency of females was higher
than that of males. The average amount of noodles consumed
was 304.1 g a day. The average amount of noodles consumed
by the males was 344.3 g, which is significantly higher than
that of the females at 268.0 g (P < 0.01). As a result of chi-square
tests; however, the relationships between gender and noodle
consumption patterns were not significant.
Across age groups, the highest noodle consumption was in 9-18
year-olds, with 353.0 g, followed by 19-50 year-olds with 333.5
g, 51-70 year-olds with 280.4 g, 71 years old and above with
252.3 g, and 1-8 year-olds with 221.5 g. In the case of males,
the highest ratio of noodle consumers was for those between
19-50 years old. For both males and females, 9-18 year-olds
consumed the highest amounts of noodles. Except for the 1-8
year-old consumers, males had higher noodle consumption than
females across all age levels, where those who were 9-18 years
old (P < 0.05), 19-50 years old (P < 0.01), and 70 years old and
above (P < 0.05) had significantly higher intakes compared to
the females (Table 3).
Table 3 shows the ranking of quantitatively consumed food
groups by age. Noodles, including macaroni, pasta, and spaghetti,
ranked in 5th place for individuals under age 8, 14-18, and 19-50
years old. Noodles ranked 4th for 9-13 year-olds and 9th for
individuals over age 51. Population aged over 50 showed lower
noodle consumption than the other age groups.
According to gender, noodle intake ranked 5th among the vast
quantity food items for both males and females, and no difference

beverages were the most highly consumed food group for both
men and woman. This was followed in the order of alcoholic
beverages, milk, and fruit juice for the men, and milk, fruit juice,
and fruit for the women.
After comparing the intakes of two age groups of consumers,
those under 18 years old and 19 years old and above, significant
relationships between age and noodle consumption (P < 0.0001)
were found. Comparisons across males and females separately
also resulted in significant relationships between age and noodle
consumption. In addition, when comparing intake levels among
7 age groups: under 1 year old, 1~8 years old, 9~13 years old,
14~18 years old, 19~50 years old, 51~70 years old, and 71 years
old and above, significant relationships between age and noodle
consumption (P < 0.0001) were found. Furthermore, comparisons
across age levels by dividing the subjects by gender revealed
significant relationships between age and noodle consumption,
except for those who were under 1 year old.
Income, ethnicity, and noodle intake
In order to examine the association between noodle consumption
and the social/economic status, the PIR (Poverty Income Ratio)
was used. The PIR refers to the poverty level ratio (or poverty
threshold), which determines income or poverty. If PIR is 1.0,
for instance, it implies living at the poverty level, and if PIR
is 0.5, it indicates a living status at half under the poverty level.
According to the U.S Census Bureau, a PIR of 0.5 means
"severely poor", and a PIR 1.25 means "near poor". In
accordance with the U.S PIR standards, we distinguished the
groups into 4 categories: "below 1.0", "1.0-1.84", "1.85-3.5", and
"above 3.5" to explore the rankings of food consumption by
income level. For PIRs below 3.5, noodle intake ranked 5th
without notable differences among the three PIR categories. On
the other hand, in the higher income group with a PIR above
3.5, noodle intake ranked 8th and showed differences from other
the three PIR groups. In the group with PIRs above 3.5, the
5th and 6th ranked food groups were fruits and vegetables,
respectively, and the 8th was breads, rolls, pancakes, and waffles
(Table 4).
The results of noodle intake by income showed that the ratio
of noodle consumers was highest in the group with PIRs below
1.0, but it was concluded that noodle consumption was not
significantly related to income. The relationships between noodle
intake amounts and income levels did not show consistent

outcomes (Table 5).
Differences in food consumption patterns are not only
influenced by culture but also by ethnicity. In order to examine
noodle consumption patterns by ethnicity, we categorized the
groups into Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,
and others. After analyzing the food groups most consumed
according to ethnicity, noodles ranked at remarkably different
positions (Table 6). Noodle intake ranked 8th for Hispanics, 6th
for non-Hispanic Whites and 5th for non-Hispanic Blacks and
others. Therefore, non-Hispanic Blacks and others consumed the
most noodles while Hispanics consumed the least. Different from
the other ethnic groups, ready-to-eat cereals ranked within the
top 10 most consumed foods in those classified as "others",
whereas the consumption of alcoholic beverages was less than
those of the other ethnic groups.
The ratios of noodle consumers and intake amounts by
ethnicity are shown in Table 7. The "other" ethnic group showed
the highest noodle intake amount with 366.1 g, followed by
Hispanics with 318.7 g, non-Hispanic whites with 298.6 g, and
non-Hispanic Blacks with 289.5 g. The average noodle intake
amount of White age 1-8 years old was 196.2 g, which was
significantly lower than 254.9 g for Hispanics' of the same age
(P < 0.01). According to the chi-square test results, the
relationships between ethnicity and noodle intake were not
significant.
Comparison of food consumption patterns between noodle
consumers and non-consumers
After dividing the subjects by noodle consumers and
non-consumers, we compared food consumption amounts for the
37 food groups for studying food group consumption pattern.
Based on re-categorized foods, we analyzed additional food
items that noodles were consumed with, which showed a variety
of ranges (Table 8). Those who ate only noodles without other
foods accounted for 64%, while the remaining 36% consumed
noodles with other foods. Those who dipped noodles in soup
or mixed them with salad represented 3% and 2.5%, respectively.
The results also indicate that frozen meals, ready-to-eat cereals,
sandwiches, dried beans and vegetables, bread/baked products,
and tortilla products were added when consuming noodle.
In all age groups, the noodle consumers showed significantly
higher intakes of beef (P < 0.05), poultry (P < 0.05), sandwiches
(P < 0.05), legumes (P < 0.01), breads (P < 0.01), ready-to-eat
cereals (P < 0.05), grain mixtures (P < 0.01), white potatoes (P
< 0.01), vegetable mixtures (P < 0.05), and nonalcoholic
beverages compared to the non-consumers. On the other hand,

the noodle consumer group tended to consume more milk, milk
desserts, fish, tropical fruit, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages,
but there were no significant differences except for tomatoes (P
< 0.05) (Table 9). In the noodle non-consumer group, those
under 18 years old consumed more food from all food groups.
The noodle non-consumers had significantly higher intakes of
cream (P < 0.01), cheeses (P < 0.01), beef (P < 0.05), mixed meat
with non-meat items (P < 0.01), ready-to-eat cereals (P < 0.05),
grain mixtures (P < 0.05), fruit juice (P < 0.05), and beverages
(P < 0.01). The noodle consumers seemed to consume more milk,
meats, such as lamb, veal, game, and other meats, as well as
tomatoes than the non-consumers (Table 10). In adults older than
19 years of age, the noodle non-consumers ate significantly more
sandwiches (P < 0.05), legumes (P < 0.01), breads (P < 0.01),
grain mixtures (P < 0.05), other fruits (P < 0.05), other vegetables
(P < 0.05), and white potatoes (P < 0.05). The adult noodle
consumers had a tendency to consume more milk, yogurt, fish,
citrus fruit, and tomatoes (Table 11). From the results, the noodle
consumers consumed more milk, fish, and fruits, and the
non-consumers consumed more meat, legumes, breads, and
beverages.

Discussion
This study provides information on noodle consumption in the
United States and shows similarities and differences in the dietary
sources of those who consume noodles compared to those who
do not. The research focused on examining noodle consumers,
understanding any differences in noodle consumption according
to demographic factors, and analyzing how the food intake of
noodle consumers differed from that of non-noodle consumers.
Even though noodles and ramen are not consumed frequently
by all consumers in the United States, noodles are a main dietary
source, especially for some ethnic groups. Moreover, the noodle
consumers differed from the non-noodle consumers in their food
intake. When the two groups were compared, the noodle
consumers showed food choices that contained more tomatoes
and less beef, poultry, sandwiches, legumes, breads, ready-to-eat
cereals, grain mixtures, white potatoes, and vegetable mixtures.
While a causal relationship was not found, noodle consumption
was associated with the choice of other food groups that were
consumed with noodles.
Age exerted a significant influence on noodle consumption,
indicating that noodle intake may differ by demographic factors.

1) Difference = intake (Noodle Consumer - Noodle Non-Consumer)
* Means are significantly different at  = 0.05 by t-test.
** Means are significantly different at  = 0.01 by t-test.
Noodle intake also differed by ethnicity, showing cultural
background to be an important factor for differences in food
group intake and can affect the nutritional status of different
ethnic groups. There were significant differences between ethnic
groups in their rankings of the vast quantity intake foodstuffs
as compared to other demographic factors such as gender, age,
and PIR. Differences in noodle consumption among age and
racial groups explain changes in both food preferences among
the age groups and the different populations. In the case of the
"other" ethnic group, including Asians, noodles and ready-to-
eat-cereals held especially high rankings in the vast quantity
intake foodstuffs. These results are due to Asian culture where
noodles are a staple food. There are, however, a number of
problems that remain to be explored. In this study, the source
of data lacked accurate demographic information. NHANES data
make no distinction between "other" ethnic groups. Therefore,
it is difficult to research the actual conditions of noodle intake
in various racial and ethnic groups belonging to the "other"
category. Another limitation of our analysis is there was no
consideration for eating location (at home or away from home).
The current study indicated that individuals consuming more
noodles showed higher consumption of tomatoes. It is probable
Chin Eun Chung et al. 251
that the major sources of noodles are pasta and spaghetti. On
the other hand, the noodle consumers had a tendency of
consuming less amounts of vegetables, beans and domestic fowl
as compared to those of non-noodle consumers. The inclusion
of noodles in planning menus for school lunch programs or food
assistance programs may further encourage the consumption of
a varied diet that contains more vegetables, legumes, poultry,
and beef. In addition, noodle consumers may benefit from new
recipes in which noodles, particularly nutrient fortified noodles,
are used in combination with vegetables and legumes. Finally,
further research is necessary to examine shifts in noodle
consumption by passage of time and demographic factors.
