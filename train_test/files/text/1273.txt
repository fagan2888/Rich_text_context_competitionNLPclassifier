Background. The association of cigarette smoking with albu-
minuria has been reported but not examined in a representative U.S.
population. No study has evaluated the association between serum
cotinine (a biological marker for tobacco exposure) and kidney
damage. Methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted
among 15,719 adult participants of the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey to assess the association between
smoking exposure and kidney damage. Smoking was assessed by
self-reported lifetime cigarette use and serum cotinine. Kidney dam-
age was assessed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), with
albuminuria defined as ACR of 17 g/mg in males and 25 g/mg
in females. Results. The analysis included 13,121 with normal
albumin (mean ACR 6.3 g/mg) and 2,414 with albuminuria (mean
ACR 143 g/mg); hypertension was prevalent in 27% and 59%,
respectively. Former smoking was similar between groups (21%),
while current smoking was more common in persons with albumin-
uria (26%) compared to normal ACR (21%). Adjusted for other risk
factors, among hypertensives, current smokers were 1.85 (95% CI:
1.29, 2.64) times more likely to have albuminuria than never smok-
ers. Current smokers with a 40 pack-year history were at highest
risk for albuminuria. Among non-smoking hypertensives, those
exposed to passive smoke (highest versus lowest quartile of serum
cotinine) were 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.90) times more likely to have
albuminuria. Former smoking with cessation of 1 year among
hypertensives was not associated with albuminuria. Among non-
hypertensives, smoking and albuminuria were not consistently
associated. Conclusion. Current and passive smoking, but not

INTRODUCTION
Although a decline in cigarette smoking has been
observed in recent years, nearly one-quarter of all adult
Americans, approximately 45.8 million persons, are current
smokers.[1] The adverse health effects of cigarette smoking,
most prominently cardiovascular and lung diseases, have
been widely reported. However, relatively fewer studies
have been devoted to kidney disease outcomes. While the
association between cigarette smoking and end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) has been inconsistently observed in popula-
tion studies,[2­4] several studies have reported that cigarette
smoking is related to urine albumin excretion[5­7] as well as
elevated serum creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration
rate (GFR).[8,9] A recent longitudinal cohort analysis using
the Framingham Heart Study by Fox et al.[10] examined pre-
dictors for new onset kidney disease defined by an esti-
mated GFR at or below the sex-specific 5th percentile over a
mean of 18.5 years of follow-up. Authors found that partici-
pants who smoked in the year prior to examination were
42% more likely to develop new onset kidney disease than
those who did not smoke.
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the
cross-sectional association between lifetime smoking dura-
tion and dose with albuminuria in the adult population exam-
ined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III). Serum cotinine is one of the primary
metabolites in nicotine and is a widely accepted biological
measure of not only cigarette smoking but also exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke (such as passive smoking). To
our knowledge, this study is the first to examine both self-
reported cigarette smoking and serum cotinine in relation to
kidney disease. Information collected as part of NHANES
III provided the opportunity to address this association in a
probability sample representative of the U.S. population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants
The NHANES III was designed to assess the health
and nutritional status of persons aged 2 months and older
in the U.S., between 1988 and 1994.[11] Details of the
NHANES III study participants and methods have been
previously published.[12] Briefly, the study used a strati-
fied, multistage cluster sampling design to obtain a repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. non-institutionalized, civilian
population. Over-sampling of the very young, elderly,
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans was done in
order to improve the precision of estimates in these sub-
groups. Of the 19,618 NHANES III participants older than
18 years of age, 912 were excluded due to missing
information on albuminuria and 184 were excluded due to
missing information on other covariates. In addition, 264
pregnant women, 159 persons with overt renal insuffi-
ciency (serum creatinine  1.8 mg/dL [> 159 mol/L] in
women and  2.0 [177 mol/L] in men), and 698 persons
of race other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, or Mexican-American were excluded, leaving
15,535 participants for the current analyses.
Measurement of Albuminuria and Kidney Damage
The physical exam included the collection of a ran-
dom urine specimen and measurement of serum creati-
nine. Urine was evaluated for albumin and creatinine by
solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay with external quality
control provided by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.[13] The ratio of urine albumin (g/mL) to urine
creatinine (mg/dL) (ACR) concentration was used to esti-
mate total daily albumin excretion. Albuminuria was
defined as a urinary ACR of 17 g/mg or higher in males
and 25 g/mg or higher in females. Macroalbuminuria was
defined as urinary ACR greater than or equal to 250 g/mg
in males and greater than or equal to 355 g/mg in
females.[14] Serum creatinine was analyzed using the mod-
ified Jaffe reaction.[13] To evaluate kidney function, esti-
mated GFR was calculated using the abbreviated
Modification in Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) Study
formula based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and
race.[15,16] The serum creatinine values from NHANES III
were calibrated to the values obtained at the laboratory in
which the glomerular filtration rate equation was
derived.[17] Categories of kidney function were defined
using GFR (mL/min per 1.73 m2) less than 60, 60 to 90,
and greater than or equal to 90, to represent moderate to
severe, mildly decreased, and normal kidney function,
respectively.[18]
Measurement of Smoking
The amount of cigarettes smoked, years of smoking,
and duration of smoking cessation were recorded as part of
the NHANES III questionnaire.[12] Lifetime smoking was
Smoking and Albuminuria in NHANES III 135
estimated in pack-years, defined as the number of years a
full pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) was smoked per day.
Smoking status was categorized as current (smoking > 1
cumulative pack years up until 12 months prior to exami-
nation), former (quit smoking and sustained cessation for
at least 12 continuous months prior to examination), or
non-smokers (never smoked or smoked  1 cumulative
pack-year). Serum cotinine level was measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography atmospheric-
pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
Persons with elevated serum cotinine, defined as greater
than or equal to 10 ng/mL, were considered exposed to
environmental tobacco smoke.
Measurement and Definition of Covariates
Seated blood pressure was measured three times
during the home interview using a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer.[12] Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
estimated as the average of all available blood pressure
readings. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic
blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, dias-
tolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg,
ever having been diagnosed as having high blood pressure
by a physician on two or more occasions, or by reported
use of antihypertensive agents during the month prior to
their study visit. Diabetes was defined as those who had
ever been told by a physician that they had diabetes or
sugar diabetes (excluding those only told they were dia-
betic during pregnancy).
Statistical Methods
The mean or proportion of each characteristic was
calculated by albuminuria status. Tests of differences by
albuminuria status were done using chi-square tests for
categorical measures and t-tests or analysis of variance for
continuous variables. Logistic regression models were
used to estimate age, race, and gender-adjusted as well as
multivariable adjusted odds ratios of albuminuria com-
pared to normal albumin excretion associated with ciga-
rette smoking. Generalized logit regression models were
used to evaluate the multivariable association of smoking
with estimated GFR at specific, pre-defined cut-points of
GFR.[18] Multivariable models were adjusted for variables
known to be associated with kidney outcomes including
age, gender, race, education, body mass index, diabetes,
blood pressure, use of anti-hypertension medication, HDL
cholesterol, and alcohol intake.
Multiplicative interaction terms of current and former
smoking and serum cotinine with gender, race, education
level, diabetic status, and hypertensive status were evalu-
ated using logistic regression models. Interaction terms
with p values less than 0.10 were considered important
stratification measures. A significant interaction was evi-
dent between former smoking and hypertension (p =
0.039); therefore, all models were stratified by hyperten-
sive status. All other interaction terms with current and
former smoking as well as cotinine were non-significant,
with p values greater than 0.10.
The statistical package SUDAAN (release 8.0.1)[19]
was used to account for weights and adjustments for
multi-stage sampling, sample selection probabilities, non-
response, and undercounts of the U.S. population esti-
mates by gender, race, and age.
RESULTS
A total of 15,535 adults were included in our analysis.
Normal albumin was observed in 13,121 participants
(mean ACR 6.3 g/mg). Albuminuria was detected among
2,414 (15.5%, mean ACR 143 g/mg) participants overall;
28% of hypertensives and 8.5% of non-hypertensives. As
expected, there were differences in demographic and clini-
cal measures by albuminuria status (see Table 1). Among
non-hypertensive participants, those with albuminuria
were more likely to be older, female, less educated, and
diabetic compared to participants with normal albumin-
uria. In this same group, systolic blood pressure was
higher while serum creatinine estimated GFR were similar
in subjects with albuminuria compared to subjects with
normal albuminuria (see Table 1). Among hypertensive
participants, those with albuminuria were more likely to
be older, non-Hispanic black, diabetic, and be in the low-
est GFR category (30­59 mL/min/1.73m2) than those
without albuminuria. Also, mean serum creatinine was
higher and estimated GFR lower among hypertensives
with albuminuria compared to those with normal albumin.
The comparison of other characteristics among hyperten-
sives between persons with albuminuria and normal albu-
min were similar to what was observed in non-
hypertensives.
Table 2 shows self-reported smoking characteristics
and levels of serum cotinine adjusted for age, sex, race,
education, and diabetes. Among all participants as well as
by hypertensive status, those with albuminuria were more
likely to be current smokers and have smoked for a greater
number of years and pack-years compared to those with
normal albumin (among current and former smokers).
Non-hypertensive former smokers with albuminuria were
more likely to have smoked for greater than or equal to 60
pack-years and less likely to have smoked less than 20
pack years.
136 S.L. Hogan et al.
The odds ratios of albuminuria associated with smoking
status, pack-years of smoking, and level of serum cotinine
are shown by hypertension status in Table 3. Among hyper-
tensives, the risk of current smoking was associated with a
1.85 increased odds of albuminuria (95% CI: 1.29, 2.64) in
multivariable adjusted models. Among hypertensive current
and former smokers, cotinine in the lower and upper 50th
percentile above elevated cotinine (10 ng/mL) demon-
strated a 1.43 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.04) and 1.61 (95% CI: 1.15,
2.27) excess risk of albuminuria, respectively, compared
to those with levels less than 10 ng/mL. No similar associ-
ations were observed among non-hypertensives.
To explore if there were a specific level of cigarette
smoking where an association with albuminuria was evi-
dent among current and former smokers by hypertension
status, pack-years were categorized into 20 pack-year
groups (< 20, 20­39, 40­59 and > 60 pack-years). As
shown in Figure 1, among hypertensives, there were
greater associations between albuminuria and current
smokers who smoked greater than 40 pack-years but no

associations among former smokers. No dose response
trend for pack-years of smoking was demonstrated among
hypertensive participants. Among non-hypertensives,
there were greater associations between albuminuria and
current and former smoking for greater than 40 pack-
years, although only the association with 60 or more pack-
years among former smokers was statistically significant.
In former non-hypertensive smokers, a dose response rela-
tionship emerged between pack years of smoking and
albuminuria.
The duration of smoking cessation was explored among
former smokers to see if longer duration of smoking cessation
attenuated the association of pack-years and albuminuria (15
years was used as the cut point for smoking cessation because
it represents the median number years of cessation reported
by former smokers; see Table 3). There were no significant
associations between duration of smoking and smoking ces-
sation with albuminuria.
Serum cotinine was categorized into quartiles to
assess the effect of passive smoking among non-smokers
on the risk of albuminuria. Hypertensive non-smokers in
the highest quartile of serum cotinine demonstrated a 1.41
(95% CI: 1.04, 1.90) increased risk of albuminuria
compared to those in the lowest quartile. In contrast, non-
hypertensive non-smokers showed no significant associa-
tion with albuminuria at any level of serum cotinine.

All associations of smoking and serum cotinine with
albuminuria were similar when subjects with macroalbu-
minuria were excluded (data not shown).
Moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR
30­59 mL/min/1.73m2) was also evaluated as an out-
come in this population. Among hypertensives, the
adjusted odds ratio of chronic kidney disease associated
with current smoking was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.91, 2.02) and
the risk associated with former smoking was 1.47 (95%
CI: 1.05, 2.07). Smoking status was not associated
with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease among
non-hypertensives. Among hypertensive and non-
hypertensive smokers (including current and former),
serum cotinine was not associated with risk of chronic
kidney disease.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates a strong association between
current smoking and albuminuria among hypertensive per-
sons, independent of other risk factors. The association
between current self-reported smoking and albuminuria
was validated by serum cotinine, which was associated
with an increased risk of albuminuria in hypertensives. A
relationship between 40 or more pack-years of smoking
with albuminuria was observed in current hypertensive
smokers. Among non-hypertensives, a relationship was
observed between 60 or more pack-years and albuminuria.
Even more striking was the observed association between
high levels of serum cotinine and albuminuria among
those who never smoked. This study provides strong,
detailed, and consistent support for the association
between smoking exposure and early kidney damage
among persons with hypertension in the general U.S.
population.
The findings from the current study are consistent
with several other cross-sectional studies that have evalu-
ated the association between smoking and kidney dam-
age.[5,7­9,20,21] These studies observed an association
between increased smoking and several markers of kidney
impairment, including decreased kidney plasma flow,[9]
elevated serum creatinine,[8] decreased and/or elevated
glomerular filtration rate,[7,9] and the presence of pro-
teinuria [20,21] or albuminuria.[5,7] Numerous studies have
also consistently found an association between smoking
and diabetic kidney disease.[22] However, irrespective of
diabetic status, persistent albuminuria is almost always
due to intrinsic kidney disease [23] and is associated with
higher risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[24]
The extent to which microalbuminuria mediates some of
the increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to smok-
ing needs further study.

Smoking and Albuminuria in NHANES III 139
Multivariable estimates of relative risks for current
smoking were similar across general population studies
with statistically significant increased risk estimates rang-
ing between 1.50 and 2.00.[3,5,10,21] The only study that
evaluated a dose-response effect found increased risks
among those who smoked greater than 20 cigarettes per
day as compared to those who smoked 20 or less per
day.[7] This was also the only other study to distinguish the
risk of microalbuminuria among former smokers with an
age- and sex-adjusted increased odds ratio of 1.27 (95%
CI: 1.04 to 1.54, p < 0.05) observed.[7] However, no
information was provided across pack-years of smoking
for former smokers or a biological marker of smoking
exposure, such as cotinine.
Many epidemiologic studies have pointed to an effect
of passive smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD).[25­30]
In a meta-analysis of CHD risk from passive smoking,[25]
there was a 25% overall increased risk of CHD in non-
smokers exposed to passive smoke compared to non-
smokers not exposed to passive smoke. No study to our
knowledge has examined the effect of passive smoke on
kidney disease. By examining levels of serum cotinine
among non-current smokers, it was found that among
hypertensives, relatively high levels of exposure to passive
smoke resulted in a 41% increased prevalence of albumin-
uria. Although those with high cotinine values (>71 ng/mL)
could represent the inclusion of some current smokers who
classified themselves as never or former smokers, the bias
from misclassification due to self-reported smoking status
is usually considered insignificant.[31,32]
Although there was an increased risk of chronic kid-
ney disease among both current and former smokers, only
the impact of former smoking was statistically significant.
Bias from differential survival among both current smok-
ers and hypertensives may influence cross-sectional stud-
ies of these factors and chronic kidney disease. The ratio
of smoker to non-smoker mortality peaks at age 45 in
developed countries.[33] Differential death from cardiovas-
cular causes including hypertension is also well known.
Furthermore, chronic kidney disease is most often observed

cholesterol.

beyond middle age. Therefore, the influence of current
smoking on chronic kidney disease requires further evalua-
tion in longitudinal and not cross-sectional studies.[10]
Several potential mechanisms for the role of smoking
in the development of albuminuria have been hypothe-
sized. The effects of smoking on the kidney are likely to
be mediated through a combination of effects, including
alterations in kidney hemodynamics and blood pressure
and damage to the microvasculature within the kidney.
Evidence suggests a similarity between atherosclerotic
lesions and glomerulosclerosis.[34­38] It has been hypothe-
sized that the atherogenic effects of cigarette smoking
extend to the microvasculature of the kidney, affecting
both renal tubular and glomerular structures.[39,40] Autopsy
studies have supported this theory and have shown an
association between a history of smoking and thickening
of renal arterioles.[41­44]
Blood cadmium concentrations in smokers are about
four times higher than in nonsmokers,[45] and cadmium
has also been implicated in the development of kidney dis-
ease. Cadmium is an environmental pollutant with nephro-
toxic properties that are absorbed into the body by, among
other sources, cigarette smoking, and has a slow excretion
rate due to renal reabsorption.[46] The effects of cadmium
nephrotoxicity may include proteinuria, calciuria, glyco-
suria, and tubular necrosis. Also, because of an extensive
half-life (30 years), chronic low level exposures to cad-
mium are also detrimental and may be associated with
end-stage renal disease, early onset diabetic kidney dis-
ease, and abnormal blood pressure regulation.[45]
Our analysis showed that the association between
smoking and albuminuria was mediated by hypertension,
which may indicate that smoking promotes the progression
of kidney disease among hypertensives. It is possible that
the vascular injury already present among hypertensive
individuals potentiates the physiological damage of smok-
ing on the kidney microvasculature, resulting in albumin-
uria or the initiation of kidney damage. Once this damage
has occurred, the development of chronic kidney disease
due to continued exposure to smoking or a myriad of other
promoting factors is likely to progress.
Our study had several important strengths. First,
because of the NHANES III sampling methods and weights,
our results can be generalized to U.S. adults. Second, the
large sample size included in our analyses allowed us to
detect any small but important associations between smok-
ing and kidney disease. Even small associations with a com-
mon exposure such as smoking can contribute to substantial
absolute numbers of persons affected. Third, using available
data, we analyzed dose and duration of both self-reported
current and former smoking as well as cotinine, a biological
marker of smoking exposure for smokers and non-smokers.
Despite its strengths, several limitations of the current
study warrant mention. As with any cross-sectional study
design, inferences are limited in terms of establishing a
causal role of smoking in the development of albuminuria,
and large, prospective studies are needed. Also, the use of
a single random urine sample for evaluation of albumin-
uria is not ideal. Although albuminuria is almost always
due to intrinsic kidney disease, false positive evaluations
can occur due to heavy exercise, fever, and extreme emo-
tional stress,[23] but these conditions are likely to be rare.
Fortunately, false negative evaluations are also rare; there-
fore, cases are unlikely to be defined as non-cases in the
current study, and any bias resulting from misclassifica-
tion will likely underestimate the association of smoking
and albuminuria. It is also important to note that diabetes
as diagnosed by fasting glucose (  126 mg/dL) was
determined in only approximately half of the NHANES III
participants. There was no evidence of different associa-
tions between smoking and albuminuria by diabetic status
in the current study.
In summary, this study provides evidence that ciga-
rette smoking is associated with the presence of albumin-
uria among hypertensive adults in the general U.S.
population. Associations with albuminuria among current
smokers are higher than among former smokers, but the
association is still evident among former smokers with a
high pack-year history of smoking. Ultimately, the contin-
ued emphasis on smoking prevention and cessation may
prove to have an impact on the incidence of albuminuria in
the general population and subsequently contribute to the
reduction of morbidities associated with albuminuria.
