OBJECTIVE -- To examine the relationship of diabetes and functional disability in older
adults and the possible mediating roles of comorbidities and A1C.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from a nationally repre-
sentative sample of 6,097 participants aged 60 years in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, 1999­2006. Diabetes was defined by self-report. Disability was defined as
difficulty performing a physical task. We evaluated disability by grouping 19 physical tasks into
five functional groups: lower-extremity mobility (LEM), general physical activities (GPA), activ-
ities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and leisure and social
activities (LSA).
RESULTS -- Older U.S. adults with diabetes had the greatest disability in GPA (prevalence
73.6% [95% CI 70.2­76.9]), followed by LEM (52.2% [48.5­55.9]), IADL (43.6% [40.1­
47.2]), ADL (37.2% [33.1­41.3]), and LSA groups (33.8% [30.8­36.9]). Diabetes was associ-
ated with two to three times increased odds of disability across functional groups (all P  0.05).
Comorbidities, mostly cardiovascular disease and obesity, and poor glycemic control (A1C
8%) together explained up to 85% of the excess odds of disability associated with diabetes,
whereas poor glycemic control alone explained only 10% of the excess odds. Adjustment for
comorbidities, A1C, and diabetes duration fully attenuated the associations of diabetes with
disability in all functional groups (all P  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- Older adults with diabetes have a high prevalence of disabilities with
variable associations attributable to comorbidities and A1C. Aggressive management of cardio-
vascular risk factors and obesity may significantly reduce the burden of disability in this
population.
Diabetes Care 33:1055­1060, 2010
In the year 2005, 2 million adults
with diabetes in the U.S. reported
having a disability (1). Adults with
functional disability consume a dispro-
portionate share of health services and are
at high risk for dependence, hospitaliza-
tions, and death (2,3). Approximately
one-third of adults aged 65 years have
diabetes (46% undiagnosed), and, by the
year 2030, elderly individuals will consti-
tute almost 20% of the U.S. population
(4,5). Consequently, understanding the
factors contributing to functional disabil-
ity in older adults with diabetes has im-
portant clinical and public health
implications.
Functional disability, defined as diffi-
culty in performing routine physical
tasks, is more common in older adults
with diabetes than in those without dia-
betes (6­12). Older adults with diabetes
have significantly greater difficulty walk-
ing one-quarter mile, climbing stairs, or
doing housework and perform worse on
measures of physical performance such as
walking speed, muscle strength, chair
stands, and tandem stand compared with
their counterparts (6­12).
The higher prevalence of functional
disability in older adults with diabetes
may be a result of diabetes-related comor-
bidities such as cardiovascular disease, vi-
sion loss, obesity, and arthritis (6­12) or
poor glycemic control (8,13). However,
these factors do not consistently explain
the association of diabetes with disability.
This inconsistency in the literature may
be due to variability in the measures of
disability studied or the limited number
of physical tasks and comorbidities exam-
ined. Previous studies have not specifi-
cally addressed the relative associations of
comorbidities and glycemic control with
disability among older adults with diabe-
tes or whether these associations differ ac-
cording to the type of physical task
examined. Furthermore, the association
of diabetes with leisure or social difficul-
ties in older adults remains poorly
described.
The objectives of the present study
were to 1) compare the prevalence of dis-
ability in adults with and without diabe-
tes, 2) assess the relative associations of
individual comorbidities and poor glyce-
mic control with the excess disability ob-
served among older adults with diabetes,
and 3) determine the independent associ-

ation of diabetes and disability across a
wide range of physical tasks, after ac-
counting for comorbidities and A1C, in a
nationally representative sample of older
adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a large, cross-sectional sur-
vey conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) designed to pro-
vide nationally representative estimates of
health and disease in the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population. Details
regarding data collection in NHANES are
available elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/nhanes.htm).
The present study was based on
NHANES data collected from 1999 to
2006. In total, there were 39,352 partici-
pants in NHANES, 1999­2006. There
were 6,472 adults aged 60 who com-
pleted both a questionnaire and a physical
examination. We excluded participants
who were missing information on diabe-
tes status (n  5), education (n  26),
BMI (n  338), or smoking history (n 
6). Thus, our study sample consisted of
6,097 adults aged 60 years.
Assessment of diabetes
Diabetes was defined by either self-report
of a physician diagnosis or insulin use.
Only adults who self-reported a history of
diabetes were also asked about noninsu-
lin glucose-lowering medication use. Du-
ration of diabetes was assessed by
questionnaire.
Assessment of disability
The interviewer posed questions about
physical functioning and asked all partic-
ipants 20 years old about difficulties
doing certain physical tasks because of
any long-term physical, mental, and emo-
tional problems or illness and without the
use of any special equipment. A total of 19
physical tasks were assessed and derived
from well-validated questionnaires (14­
17). Participants were given the option of
answering "no difficulty," "some diffi-
culty," "much difficulty," or "unable to
do." The 19 physical tasks were catego-
rized into five functional groups accord-
ing to published definitions (18). The
groups included lower-extremity mobil-
ity (LEM) (walking one-quarter mile and
walking up 10 steps); general physical ac-
tivity (GPA) (stooping/crouching/
kneeling, standing for 2 h, sitting for 2 h,
standing up from an armless chair, reach-
ing overhead, grasping/holding small ob-
jects, and lifting or carrying 10 lb);
activities of daily living (ADL) (eating,
dressing, getting out of bed, and walking
between rooms on the same floor); instru-
mental activities of daily living (IADL)
(managing money, doing household
chores, and preparing meals); and leisure
and social activities (LSA) (going to mov-
ies/shopping/events, doing leisure activi-
ties at home, and participating in social
activities).
The primary outcome was functional
disability, defined as any difficulty in a
physical task, consistent with prior stud-
ies (6,10­12). We also assessed difficul-
ties with fall, dizziness, or balance (1999­
2004 only); the need for special assistance
with walking or special equipment such
as a cane, wheelchair, special bed, or spe-
cial telephone; and the presence of a dis-
ability that prevented the participant from
working.
Assessment of demographics and
comorbidities
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and smoking was ascertained from the
questionnaire portion of the survey.
History of arthritis, coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) (including history of angina
or heart attack), stroke, congestive
heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) (including
emphysema or chronic bronchitis), and
cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin
cancer) was also self-reported. We de-
fined visual impairment as self-reported
trouble seeing despite wearing glasses or
contact lenses. Participants self-reported
whether they were limited in any way be-
cause they have "difficulty remembering"
or "experience periods of confusion."
Only participants from 1999 to 2004
were asked about self-reported history of
1) hearing difficulties, 2) leg or foot ulcer
that took 4 weeks to heal, and 3) hip
fracture.
Height, weight, waist circumference,
and blood pressure were measured. Obe-
sity was defined as BMI 30 kg/m2. Hy-
pertension was defined as an average
blood pressure of 140 mmHg (systolic)
or 90 mmHg (diastolic), antihyperten-
sive medication use, or self-reported phy-
sician diagnosis. Hypercholesterolemia
was defined as total cholesterol 240 mg/
dl, use of cholesterol-lowering medica-
tions, or self-reported physician
diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
was defined as estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. We
defined peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
as an ankle-brachial index 0.90 in ei-
ther leg and peripheral neuropathy as 1
insensate areas in either foot as assessed
by monofilament testing (1999­2004
only). Amputations were documented af-
ter physical examination.
Measurement of A1C
A1C measurements were performed by
the Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory at the
University of Missouri­Columbia using a
CLC330/CLC 385 analyzer (Primus, Kan-
sas City, MO) for 1999­2004 and by the
Diabetes Laboratory at the University of
Minnesota using an A1C 2.2 Plus Glyco-
hemoglobin Analyzer (Tosoh Medics, San
Francisco, CA) for 2005­2006. Both as-
says are Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial-aligned.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using
StataSE (version 10.0; StataCorp, College
Station, TX) and incorporated popula-
tion-based sampling weights (6- or 8-year
combined weights) to obtain unbiased,
nationally representative estimates from
the complex NHANES sampling design.
SEMs for all estimates were obtained us-
ing the Taylor series (linearization)
method following NCHS-recommended
procedures (19).
The Wald test was used to compare
differences in baseline characteristics by
diabetes status. We calculated the excess
odds of disability conferred by individual
comorbidities and suboptimally con-
trolled glucose (A1C 8%) for each func-
tional group as [(odds ratio [OR]_base 
OR_adjusted)/(OR_base  1)]  100;
where the base model was adjusted for
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-
ing, and diabetes and the adjusted model
was also adjusted for individual comor-
bidities or A1C 8%.
Logistic regression models were cre-
ated to assess the independent association
of diabetes with disability in each func-
tional group as follows: model 1 was ad-
justed for diabetes and demographic
factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, and smoking history); model 2 was
adjusted for model 1  A1C; model 3 was
adjusted for model 2  A1C  diabetes
duration; model 4 was adjusted for model
3  cardiovascular disease and risk fac-
tors (CHD, CHF, stroke, hypertension,
and high cholesterol)  obesity (BMI
30 kg/m2)  waist circumference; and
model 5 was adjusted for model 4  other
diabetes-related comorbidities (leg ulcer,

CKD, visual or hearing impairment,
memory problems, hip fracture, arthritis,
COPD, and cancer). Because information
on important comorbidities (hearing im-
pairment, leg ulcer, and hip fracture) was
not assessed in all years, we conducted
regression analyses limited to data from
the 1999­2004 survey. We excluded
PAD and peripheral neuropathy from this
analysis because these were not ascer-
tained for all participants. We performed
an F-adjusted mean residual test to assess
goodness of fit.
We performed additional analyses to
explore correlation between continuous
covariates and potential effect modifica-
tion of the association between diabetes
and disability by sex, race/ethnicity, or
age-group (60­69 years, 70­79 years,
80 years). We also investigated whether
the prevalence of disability differed by
survey year. Sensitivity analyses were per-
formed to examine whether the associa-
tion between diabetes and disability was
similar when disability was defined as in-
ability in a physical task. Among older
adults with diabetes, we further explored
whether glycemic control (A1C 8% vs.
8%), duration of diabetes (5, 5­10, or
10 years), or insulin use was indepen-
dently associated with disability in logis-
tic regression models.
RESULTS -- The prevalence of self-
reported diabetes in U.S. adults aged 60
years was 16.2% (95% CI 15.2­17.2%),
with no significant secular trends across
survey periods. Diabetes was significantly
more common in non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans, individuals with
higher BMI or waist circumference and
lower attained education level, and non-
smokers (Table 1). The mean A1C of
older adults with diabetes was 7.1%. Most
took oral medications alone, although
26.2% took insulin, including 10.8% tak-
ing combined therapy. The mean diabetes
duration was 13.8 years.
Older adults with diabetes had a
greater burden of comorbidities than
adults without diabetes. This included a
significantly higher prevalence of CHD,
CHF, stroke, hypertension, hypercholes-
terolemia, neuropathy, PAD, leg ulcers or
amputations, visual or hearing impair-
ment, memory problems, obesity, and ar-
thritis. CKD prevalence was slightly
higher in the diabetic group but was not
statistically significant compared with
that for the nondiabetic group.
Older adults with diabetes were more
likely to report difficulty performing tasks
in each functional group compared with
older adults without diabetes; we did not
find significant secular trends or evidence
for effect modification by sex, race/
ethnicity, or age-group. Thus, overall re-
sults are presented (supplementary Fig. 1,
available in an online appendix at http://
care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/
dc09-1597/DC1). Among older adults
with diabetes, the greatest difficulty was
in GPA (prevalence 73.6% [95% CI 70.2­
76.9]), followed by LEM (52.2% [48.5­
55.9]), IADL (43.6% [40.1­47.2]), ADL
(37.2% [33.1­41.3]), and LSA groups
(33.8% [30.8­36.9]). Diabetes was sig-
nificantly associated with having diffi-
culty in at least one functional group after
adjustment for demographic factors (ad-
justed OR 1.94 [1.57­2.40]; prevalence
76.9% [73.4­80.3]).
When taken together, comorbidities
and suboptimally controlled glucose
(A1C 8%) were associated with 59%
(ADL), 72% (IADL), 79% (GPA), and

85% (LEM and LSA) of the excess odds of
disability observed in older adults with
diabetes. Cardiovascular disease (includ-
ing CHD, CHF, and stroke) and obesity
together were associated with 37%
(ADL), 40% (IADL), 53% (GPA and
LEM), and 46% (LSA) of the excess odds
of disability linked with diabetes across
functional groups. Suboptimally con-
trolled glucose alone was associated with
0% (IADL), 5% (LEM and ADL), 9%
(LSA), and 10% (GPA) of the excess odds
of disability.
In logistic regression models, diabetes
was associated with significantly higher
odds of disability across all functional
groups after adjustment for demographic
factors (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.97 to
2.53, all P  0.05) (Table 2, model 1).
Adjustment for A1C and diabetes dura-
tion moderately attenuated these associa-
tions, but they remained statistically
significant across all groups (Table 2,
models 2 and 3). However, further adjust-
ment for cardiovascular disease and obe-
sity largely attenuated the ORs (Table 2,
model 4), resulting in nonsignificant as-
sociations between diabetes and disability
in all functional groups. An overall F-
adjusted test statistic of 0.70 (P  0.71)
represented good model fit.
ORs for the association of other co-
variates including demographics, A1C,
diabetes duration, and comorbidities
with disability in fully adjusted models
(as described in Table 2, model 5) across
functional groups are provided in supple-
mentary Table 1 (available in an online
appendix). Among older adults, the ORs
for diabetes are weaker than those for co-
morbidities such as hip fracture, arthritis,
and memory problems, which all have ad-
justed ORs 2. However, because the
ORs for these conditions (in particular
memory problems) were self-reported,
they may not be as reliable. In addition,
visual impairment, hearing difficulties,
and COPD were associated with signifi-
cantly greater disability across all groups
(adjusted ORs ranged between 1.46 and
2.44; all P  0.05). In contrast, the ORs
for CHD and stroke were weaker and
nonsignificant (P  0.05) for most but
not all groups.
In sensitivity analyses, when disabil-
ity was defined as inability to perform a
task, we found that diabetes remained sig-
nificantly associated with disability across
functional groups as follows: LEM (demo-
graphics adjusted OR 2.91 [95% CI
2.39­3.54]), GPA (2.64 [2.14­3.27]),
ADL (3.93 [2.39­6.47]), IADL (2.58
[1.87­3.56]), and LSA (3.67 [2.54 ­
5.31]). Diabetes was also associated with
an increased odds of having a history of
falls, dizziness, or balance problems (ad-
justed OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.40­2.19];
prevalence 40.3% [35.6­44.9]), needing
special assistance or an assistive device
(adjusted OR 2.60 [2.02­3.35]; preva-
lence 22.7% [18.9­26.5]), or having a
disability that prevented the participant
from working (adjusted OR 2.12 [1.80­
2.51]; prevalence 27.1% [23.7­30.5]) af-
ter adjustment for demographic factors.
Among older adults with diabetes, we
found that neither glycemic control, insu-
lin use, nor duration of diabetes was sig-
nificantly associated with disability in any
functional group after adjustment for de-
mographics and comorbidities (all P 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- Our results sug-
gest that older community-dwelling U.S.
adults with diagnosed diabetes are more
likely to have difficulties in each of the five
physical functioning groups and a signif-
icantly higher prevalence of comorbidi-
ties compared with adults without
diabetes. Adjustment for A1C, diabetes
duration, and comorbidities fully attenu-
ated the association of diabetes and dis-
ability in all functional groups. Together,
A1C and comorbidities accounted for up
to 85% of the excess odds of disability,
largely due to cardiovascular disease and
obesity, whereas poor glycemic control
(A1C 8%) alone only accounted for up
to 10% of the excess odds of disability
associated with diabetes across all groups.
Our findings support previous stud-
ies that also reported a two to three times
greater odds of difficulty in performing
mobility, upper-extremity, ADL, and
IADL tasks among older adults with dia-
betes compared with adults without dia-
betes (6­12). The prevalence of disability
we report is consistent with findings in
other nationally representative samples of
adults of similar age (6). We also found a
high degree of difficulty in performing lei-
sure and social activity tasks, which has
not been examined in previous studies.
However, we found that our results were
similar when we defined disability as in-
ability in a physical task, a more specific
measure.
In addition, past studies did not ex-
plore the relative associations of multiple
comorbidities and poor glycemic control
to the relationship between diabetes and
disability nor examine whether these as-
sociations varied by type of task, which
were both important aims of our study.
Comorbidities contribute greatly to the
health-related quality of life in adults with
diabetes, although social and environ-
mental factors are probably also impor-
tant. Glycemic control is an important
goal of diabetes management although
higher A1C targets (e.g., A1C 8%) may

be reasonable in an older population (20).
Our data suggest that, in contrast with
poor glycemic control (A1C 8%), co-
morbidities are more greatly associated
with excess disability in diabetes across all
functional groups. In contrast, De Rek-
eneire et al. (8) and Bossoni et al. (13)
reported that poor glycemic control was
significantly associated with the excess
subclinical LEM limitations and IADL dis-
ability observed in diabetes. Diabetes du-
ration was also associated with disability
in our study, similar to previous reports
(6). We found that the greater difficulties
in LEM, GPA, ADL, and IADL groups ob-
served in older adults with diabetes com-
pared with those without diabetes are
largely associated with comorbidities and
corroborate prior findings that diabetes-
associated cardiovascular disease and
obesity are linked with much of the excess
disability observed in these tasks
(6,7,11). Interestingly, the higher preva-
lence of disability we report in leisure and
social activities among older adults with
diabetes was also largely associated with
prevalent comorbidities.
Diabetes may be associated with func-
tional disability through mechanisms
linked to decreased cardiopulmonary re-
serve, restricted physical movement, in-
flammatory/sarcopenic processes,
extremes of blood glucose, or inflexible
treatment regimens. We confirm that
older adults with diabetes have a high
burden of cardiovascular disease and obe-
sity; both these conditions are associated
with limited cardiopulmonary reserve
and exercise tolerance. Further, other
prevalent comorbidities in adults with di-
abetes such as visual impairment or
stroke may restrict physical movement
and participation in routine activities. De-
creased muscle strength, lower muscle
quality, and accelerated loss of muscle
mass, especially in the lower extremities,
have all been documented in individuals
with diabetes (21).
Through these mechanisms, older
adults with diabetes may be more likely to
develop frailty (22), a clinical condition in
which an older individual is coping just
above the disability threshold but is liable
to become disabled in response to a phys-
iological or psychological stressor. Hy-
perglycemia may activate inflammatory
pathways that subsequently cause muscle
catabolism and disability as part of the
frailty process (21,22). On the other
hand, physical and cognitive impairment
may lead to difficulties in diabetes self-
management and subsequent hyperglyce-
mia; thus, the relationship between
hyperglycemia and disability is poten-
tially bidirectional. Because of the limita-
tions of the study design, we were
unable to address the directionality of the
observed associations. A1C may also re-
flect health care access, patient self-
management, and physician prescribing
practices. Support for an association be-
tween hyperglycemia and disability
comes from previous studies reporting a
significant correlation between higher
A1C levels and disability (8,13). How-
ever, our findings suggest that among
older adults with diagnosed diabetes,
poor glycemic control is not greatly asso-
ciated with the excess disability observed.
Interestingly, even among a population of
older adults with diabetes and relatively
well-controlled glucose levels such as
ours, there exists a significantly increased
risk of falling, balance, and dizziness dif-
ficulties compared with older adults
without diabetes. Further, restrictive
treatment regimens, especially for pa-
tients taking insulin, may be associated
with greater difficulty participating in lei-
sure activities.
A strength of our study is the evalua-
tion of disability in diabetes across differ-
ent functional groups. Fried et al. (23)
previously provided a strong rationale for
categorizing physical tasks into functional
groups, and self-reported physical func-
tioning has been demonstrated to be a re-
liable measure (24). Our study was based
on difficulty in 19 individual tasks, in-
cluding leisure and social activities, which
has not been ascertained in most previous
studies. This comprehensive assessment
allowed us to explore the association of
diabetes-related comorbidities and A1C
with disability in each functional group.
Other strengths of our study include the
rigorous data collection procedures in
NHANES and the ability to generate na-
tionally representative estimates, which
allows for comparison with other studies
that used national samples (6).
Limitations of our study include the
cross-sectional design, which does not
permit us to draw conclusions regarding
the temporality of the observed associa-
tions and renders our study vulnerable to
survival bias. Individuals with diabetes
are more likely to die at younger ages
compared with their counterparts with-
out diabetes and may be systematically
missing from this study of older adults
(survival bias). Also, NHANES does not
include institutionalized individuals who
probably have a more severe and higher
prevalence of disability than the general
population. As a result, the prevalence of
disability may be underestimated in our
study.
Although highly specific for most
outcomes, self-reported information for
cardiovascular disease and other comor-
bidities is a limitation and probably un-
derestimates the true prevalence of these
conditions. This is of particular concern
for our measure of cognitive function; the
critical relationship between cognitive
impairment and disability cannot be fully
accounted for in this study and is a crucial
area in which additional work is needed.
Subclinical or undiagnosed cases of dis-
ease are also not captured by these
self-reported measures. In particular,
subclinical cardiovascular disease is prob-
ably prevalent among older adults with
diabetes but may be missed by self-
reported measures. Because this study fo-
cused on diagnosed diabetes, individuals
with undiagnosed disease are included in
the nondiabetic group. Those with undi-
agnosed diabetes probably have disability
intermediate between that of individuals
with diagnosed diabetes and without true
diabetes; consequently, the prevalence of
disability in both groups (diabetes or no
diabetes) may be overestimated in our
study. Analyses using different definitions
of diabetes may result in different find-
ings. Furthermore, diabetes in the older
adult population is heterogeneous and in-
cludes individuals with both middle-age
and elderly-onset diabetes; the latter
group has been shown to have a lower
burden of complications, especially mi-
crovascular disease (25) and has less dis-
ability in our study (data not shown).
In summary, there is growing recog-
nition that the presence of functional dis-
ability significantly influences the clinical
care of older adults with diabetes. Our
data demonstrate that older adults with
diabetes have a high prevalence of disabil-
ities, across a range of physical tasks, with
variable associations attributable to dia-
betes-related comorbidities and A1C.
Our results suggest that cardiovascular
disease and obesity, in particular, are as-
sociated with a greater burden of disabil-
ity in this population, whereas the
association of hyperglycemia with disabil-
ity needs further investigation. Future
studies to examine the prospective asso-
ciation of diabetes and disability should
provide greater insight into the direction
of this relationship; in particular, how di-
abetes leads to disability and how disabil-

ity, in turn, can lead to worsening
hyperglycemia.
