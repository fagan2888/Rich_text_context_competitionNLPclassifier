Pooled Purchasing:
Who Are The Players?
A first look at where purchasing pools have taken hold and whether they are
living up to employers' and policymakers' expectations.
by Stephen H. Long and M. Susan Marquis
Policymakers at both the federal
and state levels are interested in pooled
purchasing of employer health plans as
a way of making insurance more accessible
and affordable. They see pooled purchasing as
a way to control costs, especially for small
employers, by aggregating purchasing power
across many employers, coordinating admini-
stration, and promoting the principles of
managed competition.1 Even for medium-size
and large employers, pooled purchasing looks
like a promising arrangement to provide the
expertise to undertake selective contracting
with plans, to negotiate prices, and to collect
and share data on plan quality.2 On the other
hand, some observers fear that purchasing
pools lead to greaterrisk selection. If the pools
are open to all employers while the rest of the
market is not, then they may become dump-
ing grounds for high-risk employer groups,
leading to spirals of adverse selection.3 Yet if
pools are permitted to determine which em-
ployers are offered entry, they might work
against access and affordability by selecting
only groups with favorable risk profiles.
Several hypotheses have been advanced
about the likely effects of pooled purchasing.
Pools are expected to make insurance accessi-
ble to employers who otherwise would not
purchase insurance. They also are expected to
afford more choices to employees, both in the
number of plans offered and especially in ac-
cess to health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) for employees in small groups.4 Em-
ployers participating in pools are expected to
provide workers with more information
about their health plan options, and particu-
larly about the quality of health plans.5 Fi-
nally, pooled purchasing is expected to lower
premium costs--at minimum for participat-
ing employers, and possibly through spillover
effects to the rest of the market.6
Policymakers also have expectations about
which employers will be most likely to par-
ticipate in pooled purchasing arrangements.
Small employers are expected to join pools
more often than large ones are, because large
groups already enjoy the advantages of lower
claims variability, economies of scale in ad-
ministration, and greater market power in ne-

ABSTRACT: Data from the 1997 Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance
Survey provide the first national estimates of the
prevalence of pooled purchasing under all major
arrangements. About one-quarter of all busi-
nesses participate in a pool; smaller businesses
are more likely to participate, and there is sub-
stantial geographic variation in the prevalence of
pool participation. Pooling appears to have mod-
est positive effects on the availability of em-
ployee choice among plans (especially health
maintenance organizations) and on the availabil-
ity of information about plan quality. On the other
hand, pooling as now construed does not seem
to have enhanced the accessibility or affordabil-
ity of insurance to employers.

gotiating with health plans. The extent of
pooled purchasing may vary across markets.
In markets with high managed care penetra-
tion rates, HMOs may have a greater incentive
to participate in pools to seek market share,
thereby increasing pools' attractiveness to
employers. On the other hand, greater man-
aged care penetration may lead to lower costs,
blunting employers' incentive to seek cost-
control solutions through pooling. Finally, the
greater the heterogeneity of the workforce,
the more likely the business is to participate
in a pooled arrangement, to cater to the varied
tastes of its employees.
This paper draws on a large national sur-
vey of employer health insurance to examine
the prevalence of pooled purchasing and to
test hypotheses about its effects and about
employers' participation.
STUDY METHODS
We used data from the 1997 Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insur-
ance Survey to measure the extent and effects
of pooled purchasing. The survey interviewed
21,545 private employers nationwide. Its sam-
ple was drawn from the Dun's Market Identi-
fiers national census of employment estab-
lishments, supplemented by list samples of
employers participating in specified health in-
surance purchasing alliances in three states
(California Managed Risk Medical Insurance
Board, Connecticut Business and Industry
Association, and Florida Community Health
Purchasing Alliances).7 The sample was con-
centrated in the sixty communities followed
by the Community Tracking Study and in
twelve states with significant small-group in-
surance reforms, the latter chosen for research
on small-group rating reforms or special
pooled purchasing programs for small
groups.8 Within geographic units the samples
were further allocated to strata defined by the
number of workers at the establishment. The
sample establishments are weighted for these
analyses to represent all private employment
establishments with at least one employee in
the continental United States.
Data were collected by computer-assisted
telephone interviews averaging thirty min-
utes each. The interview was conducted with
the person or persons in each establishment
who were most knowledgeable about health
benefits and firm and worker characteristics.9
The response rate was 60 percent.
n CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS. We
based our definition of pooled purchasing on
the respondent's assessment by asking all es-
tablishments that offer insurance, "Does your
company purchase health insurance through:
a health insurance purchasing cooperative or
alliance; a business coalition; a multiple em-
ployer trust (MET) or a multiple employer
welfare association (MEWA); or a trade or
professional association, or other membership
organization?" For most analyses we classi-
fied employers according to whether they en-
gaged in pooled purchasing, regardless of the
specific type.10 For selected characteristics,
we compared employers participating in one
of the three largest statewide small-employer
purchasing cooperatives (named above) with
employers participating in other pooled
arrangements.
Although the sample and analysis unit is
the establishment--the firm's physical loca-
tion--for many analyses we categorized es-
tablishments according to the firm's size,
which includes employees at all locations na-
tionwide. We did this because insurance de-
cisions are typically made at a regional or na-
tional level for firms with several
establishments.
We classified establishments by the state
in which they were located and by the degree
of HMO penetration in their area. The latter
was measured only for the sixty Community
Tracking Study sites; it was calculated from
the survey data as the share of employees in
the site enrolled in their employer-sponsored
plan who were in an HMO. Classification of a
plan as an HMO was based on the respon-
dent's self-assessment, aided by complete
definitions of plan types as needed.
Employers were classified as "offering a
choice of plans" if they offered two or more
plans, whether of the same or different types
and whether through the same or different

carriers. We also report whether employees
were given comparative quality information
to facilitate their choice of plans. The survey
collected these data only for firms offering a
choice of plans and having 500 or more em-
ployees nationwide. The specific types of in-
formation considered were enrollee satisfac-
tion ratings and plan performance measures
such as Health Plan Employer Data and Infor-
mation Set (HEDIS) measures.
Finally, we measured both the current
health insurance premium level and the
change from the previous year. The former
measure was based on plan-specific data, re-
ported separately for single and family rates.11
The latter measure was based on an estab-
lishment-level question about change in total
health insurance cost per enrollee compared
with the last plan year.
RESULTS
n PREVALENCE AND PARTICIPATION.
Twenty-six percent of all businesses partici-
pate in some form of pooled purchasing for
health insurance, including purchasing alli-
ances, business coalitions, multiple employer
arrangements, or trade and other associations.
Participation is more prevalent among smaller
firms, ranging from 33 percent of those with
fewer than ten employees to 14 percent of
those with 500 or more employees (Exhibit 1).
The prevalence of pooled purchasing varies
considerably across geographic areas. In the
ten states for which we had an adequate sam-
ple size to support state estimates, participa-
tion rates ranged from 21 percent to 42 per-
cent (Exhibit 2). Surprisingly, the three states
with the largest formal purchasing alliances
for small business--California, Florida, and
Connecticut--represented the full range of
participation rates among the ten states
shown. Similarly, California and Connecticut
had the lowest and highest participation
rates, respectively, when we limited our focus
to establishments with fewer than fifty em-
ployees. The extent of managed care penetra-
tion apparently has little to do with the de-
gree of pooled purchasing (Exhibit 2).
One objective of pooled purchasing is to
increase the accessibility of insurance, espe-
cially among small employers. If this objective
is being met, we would expect to find that a
higher percentage of pool participants re-
cently began to offer insurance. Yet this per-
centage, illustrated by establishments offer-
ing insurance for two years or less, is not
greater for small businesses participating in a
pool (Exhibit 3).
We did not see evidence of differential risk
selection in pooled purchasing arrangements.

Characteristics of employees that are related
to health risk--sex, age, and earnings--did
not differ between businesses that did and did
not participate in pools (Exhibit 3). We also
found little evidence to support the hypothe-
sis that heterogeneity of workers within the
establishment, leading to more varied tastes
for health insurance products, increases the
likelihood of pooled purchasing. Equal pro-
portions of businesses that did and did not
participate in pools scored in the top quartile
of a measure of age and income heterogeneity
of workers (Exhibit 3).12 In analyses limited to
small businesses in California, Connecticut,
and Florida--that is, the states with estab-
lished purchasing alliances--we also did not
find support for the risk-selection or worker
heterogeneity hypotheses.
n CHOICE AND INFORMATION. In gen-
eral, participating in any pooled purchasing
arrangement has a modest positive effect on
whether small and medium-size businesses
offer a choice of two or more health plans to
their employees. Participation in a pool raises
the likelihood that a choice of plans is offered
from 12 percent to 15 percent in firms of under
500 employees (Exhibit 4). In contrast, how-
ever, 80 percent of the participants in the
three state-specific purchasing alliances for
small businesses offer a choice of plans, versus
23 percent of employers in these three states
who participate in another type of pool and 15
percent of those who do not participate in
pooled purchasing at all. Choice of plan is not
universal under these alliances because not all
alliances require participating employers to
offer a choice.13
Participation in pooled purchasing also
slightly, but consistently, increases the likeli-
hood that employees are offered an HMO. In
small and medium-size businesses nation-
wide, 43 percent of pool participants offered
their employees an HMO option, compared
with 40 percent of nonparticipants. The rate
is considerably higher in the three study alli-
ances--about 80 percent. HMO penetration
in these three states is only somewhat above
average, yet alliance participants are consider-
ably more likely to offer an HMO, even com-
pared with other pooled purchasers in these
states.
Pooled purchasing also has a positive effect
on the provision of information to aid con-
sumers in choosing among plans (not shown).

Among establishments of large employers
(500 or more workers nationwide) participat-
ing in pools, 33 percent provide comparative
quality information. In contrast, only 21 per-
cent of those that are not in pools do so.
n COST. In contrast to the modest positive
effects of pooled purchasing on choice and in-
formation, these arrangements appear to have
little effect on health insurance costs for their
participants. Whether we consider the levels
of current premiums or their latest annual
percentage change, employers participating
in pools do not appear to have enjoyed signifi-
cant cost savings.14 For example, in 1997
monthly single premiums for small-employer
participants were $180, compared with $172
for nonparticipants (Exhibit 5). Other differ-
ences between participants and nonpartici-
pants are also small and do not follow a con-
sistent pattern.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, ours are the first national
estimates of the prevalence ofpooled purchas-
ing in all of its major forms. There were some
surprises. The extent of this practice is much
greater than we had anticipated. On the other
hand, we had expected to find an even steeper
gradient in pooling by firm size, with a much
greater likelihood of pooled purchasing

among the smallest employers and a much
sharper fall-off among large employers.
Pooled purchasing does have a positive ef-
fect on employers' provision of choice and in-
formation, but the effect fell far short of our
expectations. This may be because we com-
bined all of the different forms of pooling. We
found much stronger effects when we consid-
ered the three small-business alliances
separately.
We found descriptive evidence that pooled
purchasing has no effect on cost. Our evidence
is far from definitive, however. For example,
there is a chance that higher-cost employer
groups choose pools in an effort to reduce
their health insurance outlays, leading to
higher observed costs for pool participants
and lower observed costs for nonparticipants.
However, given the similarity of the age and
sex distribution of participant and nonpar-

ticipant workforces, our data do not suggest
that substantial risk selection explains the
failure to find cost savings. One possible ex-
planation for the similarity of costs in and out
of pools is that the pools have led to market
spillover savings through heightened compe-
tition. But it seems likely that in many cases
pools are simply alternative ways to get to the
same products everyone else is offering.
Clearly, there is a need for more research
beyond what this first descriptive study can
do. The pooled purchasing we examined com-
prised a broad range of arrangements. We
found some evidence that the outcomes may
differ substantially under different forms, but
further work is needed to disaggregate the
types of pooling and to do more carefully con-
trolled studies within markets of the partici-
pants and nonparticipants.15

13. In California all employees are offered the full
roster of plans available through the alliance in
their geographic area. In Florida the employer
must offer at least two plans and may choose to
offer as many others as are available inthe region.
In Connecticut some employers participating in
the alliance do not offer a choice of plans.
14. These premiums were not standardized for
benefit differences. Also, we did not test for cost
differences in the three states with established
purchasing alliances.

wide alliances discussed here.
