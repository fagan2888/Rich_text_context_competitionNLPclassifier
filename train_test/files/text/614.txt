Abstract
Background Preventing externalizing problems in children is a major societal concern,
and a great number of intervention programs have been developed to this aim. To evaluate
their preventive effects, well-controlled trials including follow-up assessments are
necessary.
Methods This is a systematic review of the effect of prevention programs targeting
externalizing problems in children. The review covered peer reviewed publications in
English, German, French, Spanish and Scandinavian languages. Experimental studies of
standardized programs explicitly aiming at preventing externalizing mental ill-health in
children (2­19 years), with outcome assessments at C6 months post intervention for both
intervention and control groups, were included. We also included long-term trials with
consecutive observations over several years, even in the absence of follow-up C6 months
post intervention. Studies of clinical populations or children with impairments, which
substantially increase the risk for mental disorders, were excluded.

Results Thirty-eight controlled trials assessing 25 different programs met inclusion
criteria. Only five programs were supported by scientific evidence, representing selective
parent training (Incredible Years and Triple-P), indicated family support (Family Check-
Up), and school-based programs (Good Behavior Game, universally delivered, and Coping
Power, as an indicated intervention). With few exceptions, effects after 6­12 months were
small. Long-term trials showed small and inconsistent effects.
Conclusions Despite a vast literature, the evidence for preventive effects is meager,
largely due to insufficient follow-up post intervention. Long-term follow up assessment
and effectiveness studies should be given priority in future evaluations of interventions to
prevent externalizing problems in children.

Introduction
The general physical health of children in the Western world is excellent, but there is
growing concern that an increasing number of children may be struggling with mental
health problems. In response to this, a vast number of prevention programs have been
developed and implemented in schools, municipal services, and health services.
Symptoms of mental ill-health in children may be either externalizing or internalizing in
character. This distinction does not preclude that the same child may suffer from symptoms
of both kinds, and that aggressive, acting-out behavior may indeed mask depressive
feelings and anxiety. Even so, externalizing and internalizing problems are usually
understood in different etiological terms, and met with different intervention strategies.
In general, prevention programs targeting externalizing problems in children build on
behavioral and social learning principles. Major formats for delivery are parent training
and school-based programs. Parent training programs aim to strengthen positive parenting
and reduce coercion, which in turn will reinforce pro-social development in the child (e.g.
DeGarmo et al. 2004). School-based prevention programs typically train children in self-
regulation and social skills (e.g. Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group 1999), and/
or train teachers in how to respond to acting-out children in ways that will promote positive
development (e.g. Ialongo et al. 1999). School programs may be implemented in their own
right, or as a complement to parent training, in a multimodal format (e.g. Eddy et al. 2003).
There are different strategies for delivery of prevention programs. Universal prevention
targets entire populations. Selective prevention is offered to sub-populations with known
risk factors, for instance children living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods, or children of parents with substance abuse. Notably, selective prevention is not
based on the assessed risk of the individual child. This is however the case for indicated
prevention, which may be offered to children with, for example, elevated symptom levels.
Because of its focus on the individual, indicated prevention allows for tailoring the
intervention to individual needs (Mrazek and Haggerty 1994).
In order to evaluate preventive effects, it is necessary to study what happens over time.
To determine if the intervention decreases the likelihood for the unwanted future outcome,
follow-up assessments, of both the intervention and the control group, are imperative.
According to standards formulated by the Society for Prevention Research, the minimal
252 Child Youth Care Forum (2015) 44:251­276
123
post intervention interval before follow-up must be 6 months (Flay et al. 2005). Few
prevention studies meet these standards. Typically, original studies as well as published
systematic reviews of prevention programs have focused on the immediate effects on child
behavior, measured directly post intervention.
In a systematic review of the effect of training programs for parents of children
0­7 years, Kaminski et al. (2008) included 48 controlled studies. They found a stan-
dardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.25, favoring intervention, from pre to post test.
Lundahl et al. (2006) included 63 controlled studies on parent training programs, and found
that the SMD was 0.42 post test, but decreased to 0.21 at follow-up, specified only as
``months later''. Barlow and Parsons (2003) pooled five studies of training programs for
parents of children age 0­3 years. The effect size was 0.44 for parental observations and
0.55 for independent observers. However, only two studies had follow-up data, according
to which positive effects diminished and became insignificant.
Three systematic reviews have analyzed the effects of school-based interventions to
prevent externalizing symptoms. Wilson and Lipsey (2007) conducted a broad meta-
analysis and included 249 studies, with no explicit criteria for study quality, and found an
effect size of 0.21 for universal programs, 0.29 for selective programs and 0.05 (n.s.) for
multimodal programs, in a pre to post intervention test. Effects were largely the same for
programs implementing behavioral, cognitive, and social skills components. Hahn et al.
(2007) found a 15 % reduction in acting-out behavior, when pooling twelve studies that
had externalizing problems as outcome measure. Effects at follow-up were not quantified
but were reported to decrease with time. Mytton et al. (2006) included 34 randomized
controlled trials (RCT) fulfilling Cochrane quality criteria and targeting aggressive and
violent behavior. The post-test effect size was 0.41, with no tendency to decline in the
seven studies that had a follow-up at 12 months.
It is striking that although a primary aim of most programs is to prevent serious
externalizing problems in adolescence by offering interventions to children of preschool or
early school age, none of the previous reviews have systematically investigated the lasting
effects of these programs. Rather, the reviews, like the majority of the primary studies,
focus on pre- to post intervention effects, with unsystematic reporting of follow-up
assessments, at best. Likewise, previous reviews have often summarized intervention
effects, without distinguishing between prevention strategies, or between prevention and
clinical treatment trials.
Aiming to fill this gap, and in accordance with the Society for Preventive Research
guidelines, our systematic review had a firm focus on studies with a follow-up period of at
least 6 months post program termination. We also aimed to limit the review to prevention
programs, and exclude interventions offered to children seeking clinical treatment for
manifest problems. With this focus on preventive effects, the following research questions
were posed:
· Which programs are effective in preventing mental ill-health of the externalizing type?
· What is the relative effectiveness of universal, selective or indicated prevention
programs?
· Are there any risks involved in using the programs?
The present state of knowledge did not provide a basis for formulating testable
hypotheses, and the review was therefor largely explorative. However, we did expect
weaker evidence for effect when applying a 6 months follow-up criterion, as compared to
post intervention tests. Also, in keeping with the prevention literature at large, we expected

123
smaller effect sizes for universal as compared to selective and indicated prevention trials.
For ethical reasons, we included a specific focus on possible negative intervention effects.
Methods
The systematic review presented in this article is primarily based on a health technology
assessment conducted by the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU),
an independent public authority. The total assessment also included a systematic review of
programs to prevent internalizing symptoms (SBU 2010). The literature search included
PubMed, PsycInfo, ERIC and IBSS databases and was supplemented with studies found in
reference lists and web sites dedicated to some of the programs. The literature search for
the initial review was tailored to identify controlled studies, published in in English,
German, French or any of the Scandinavian languages, in peer-reviewed journals between
Jan 1, 1990 and October 30, 2009. The complete search strategy can be found at http://
www.sbu.se/upload/Publikationer/Content0/1/barnpsykhalsa_bilagor/Bilaga%201.%20S%
C3%B6kstrategier.pdf. Studies published prior to 1990 were included, to the extent that
they were referred to in studies identified through the systematic literature search. For the
purpose of the present article, a complementary literature search was performed in Feb-
ruary 2013 in PubMed, now limited to studies on programs that had been identified in the
original search. Four additional articles that fulfilled our criteria were found, reporting on
trials of three different programs (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group 2010,
2011; Hahlweg et al. 2010; Reedtz et al. 2011).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included studies of programs aiming at preventing externalizing mental ill-health in
children aged 2­19 years, i.e. from the early preschool years through adolescence. Since
the focus was prevention, studies on clinical populations, and on children with impairments
or medical conditions that substantially increase the risk for mental ill health, were
excluded. The programs were required to be standardized and to have an explicit aim to
prevent mental ill health. Interventions solely targeting antisocial behaviors, with sub-
stance abuse or delinquency as outcome measures and without assessment of mental
health, were not included. The intervention could be directed at children and/or parents and
be delivered on an individual basis or in a group setting. Care as usual (CAU) or alternative
preventive interventions were accepted as control conditions. The studies had to investigate
effects on mental health in children participating in the trial, and presumed mediators of
effect were not accepted as primary outcome measures. Outcome measures included rating
scales or clinical assessments of symptoms, structured behavioral observations, school
adjustment measures with externalizing behavior assessment components (e.g. Teacher
Observation of Classroom Adaptation; TOCA), clinical diagnoses of psychiatric illness
and, finally, measures indicating antisocial behavior (e.g. self assessment). Outcome had to
be measured no less than 6 months post intervention, and include both intervention and
control groups.
With our focus on long-term effects, we also included studies that followed outcome for
several years after program termination, even if all inclusion criteria were not met.
Likewise, we included long-term trials reporting consecutive observations over several
years, also in the absence of a follow-up 6 months post intervention, or later. Hence, the
review of long-term outcome was less rigorous than our main protocol, and the results are

reported under a special heading. Studies reporting negative effects, indicating that the
program may involve risks, were included regardless of study design.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Two members of the research group, independently of each other, screened abstract lists
and selected studies to be reviewed in full-text. All studies selected by at least one member
were read in full text, again by two researchers, for evaluation of study relevance and
quality, and extraction of study data. Studies had to meet all of the following standards to
be of adequate quality for inclusion in the analysis of the scientific evidence for effect:
(a) adequate control of confounders, (b) attrition rates under 30 %, attrition rates of
30­50 % being accepted if a satisfactory attrition analysis was reported, (c) intent-to-treat
(ITT) analysis, reported or calculable, and (d) analysis considering relevant confounders in
non-randomized studies. If the two researchers were in disagreement regarding study
relevance and quality, the study was processed in the entire group of eight researchers,
guided by principle of consensus. Overall, the review process followed the PRISMA
guidelines (www.prisma-statement.org). More detailed information about the evaluation of
the quality of each study is available on request.
Data Analysis
When possible, meta-analyses were conducted by using the Cochrane Collaboration
Review Manager software (http://ims.cochrane.org/revman). The pooled results for con-
tinuous outcomes were expressed as SMD, in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration
recommendations. Effect sizes were classified as small, medium or large as proposed by
Cohen (1992). A requisite for drawing conclusions regarding the scientific evidence for
effect of a specific program was that it had been subject to at least two trials that met the
inclusion criteria and had comparable outcome measures.
Research Ethics
Prior to the review, all research group members had signed a declaration assuring no
conflict of interests. The study did not involve primary data, and ethical review and
approval was therefor not applicable.
Results
A flow chart of the literature search and review is presented in Fig. 1. A substantial
number of studies were excluded, either after reviewing the abstracts or the full text,
due to an insufficient follow-up period. In the end, 38 controlled trials with adequate
study quality were identified, evaluating in total 25 different prevention programs for
externalizing problems. The vast majority of the included trials had been conducted in
the USA, followed by Canada, Australia, and England. Only a few selective trials had
been performed in Continental Europe. The programs included are summarized in
Table 1.

Design of Trials
Thirty-six of the 38 studies were RCT, and two were controlled without randomization.
Four of the RCTs had used an optimal method for randomization. The number of par-
ticipants in the respective trials varied from 100 to 998, with the largest samples recruited
for universal trials.
The majority of the trials employed a no intervention or CAU control group. Two had
what is best described as an attention control, whereas six employed a design with more
than one treatment condition, to be compared with no intervention.
As primary outcome measure, the majority of trials employed various symptom rating
scales. A few studies also included structured behavioral observations, as a complementary
outcome measure. Long-term follow-up studies used (presence or absence of) psychiatric
diagnoses as an index of outcome, as well as overall psychosocial adjustment including
educational attainment and employment. Eleven studies had used some sort of blinded
outcome assessment.
Program Content, Length and Intensity
All included programs contained cognitive-behavioral components. Many of the programs
were modified versions of interventions that had first been developed as clinical treatments
(e.g. Incredible Years/IY). Cognitive techniques were most visible in programs targeting
older children, whereas purely behavioral techniques were more frequent for young chil-
dren. Clear examples of the latter were the Good Behavior Game (GBG), which uses a
token economy to encourage on-task and pro-social group performance, and the parent
management techniques promoted by IY and the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P).
Social learning theory had influenced program content visibly in both cognitive and

modeling techniques. Several programs targeting parents included home assignments on
the assumption that positive change requires active practice of new and more adaptive
behaviors. One single program, Prime Time, subject to only one included trial, gave
reference to attachment theory.
Program length ranged from three sessions given within a single month, to several
years. The longer interventions tended to be less intensive. Most common were weekly
sessions over a period of 3­9 months. The shortest programs were unimodal, targeting
parents, whereas extended interventions tended to be multimodal. Program length varied
with content and target populations, in a way that defied analysis regarding its unique
impact on effect.
Competence of Staff
In general, program staff members were highly qualified, both with respect to general
educational background and specific program competence. Many trials relied on health
professionals, such as psychologists and counselors (31 %), quite a few used graduate
students (17 %) or other members of the research team (17 %). Several programs were
implemented in schools, and teachers served as program staff in 28 % of the trials.
Notably, just a few trials (8 %) were conducted without involvement of the program
developers.
Program Target Population and Prevention Level
According to our classification, five (14 %) of the 36 trials used a universal strategy of
delivery, 16 (44 %) were selective, and 15 (42 %) were indicated. Note that our classifi-
cation was not always in agreement with that of the authors, who might consider a program
universal if it was offered to all families in a high-risk neighborhood. According to our
definition, such interventions were classified as selective.
Basic information including findings from all of the included studies of universal,
selective and indicated programs, respectively, is summarized in Tables 2, 3, 4. Length of
follow-up(s) is stated, and the overall outcome is expressed as ?/0/-; where ? indicates a
statistically significant positive effect of the intervention, 0 no effect and - a negative
effect of the intervention, i.e. the control group had a better outcome than the intervention
group. More detailed information, on all studies included, can be retrieved in tabulated
form at http://www.sbu.se/upload/publikationer/Content1/1/Eng_tabeller_psykiskohalsa_
web.pdf.
Effects of Universal Prevention Trials
In the following subsections, effect sizes are expressed in accordance with Cohen's (1992)
recommendations. A standard mean difference of 0.20 between intervention and control
groups is referred to as a ``small'', 0.50 as a ``medium'' and 0.80 and beyond as a ``large
effect''.
Six different programs were studied in one universal trial each. Three of them were
school-based and entirely implemented in the classroom by teachers under supervision,
namely Rochester Social Problem Solving Training Program, Second Step, and the GBG.
Another three programs were school-based but also involved parents; the Baltimore
Classroom-Centered and Family School Project (including GBG as a school component),

the Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS) program, and the Adolescent
Transition Program, which rests heavily on parental involvement. No universal programs
targeting parents only met our inclusion criteria.
Results regarding effect of universal trials are summarized in Table 2. According to
three studies, GBG reduced symptoms of externalizing behavior in schoolchildren for at
least 12 months, although effect sizes were small. Other universal school programs had
been subject to a maximum of one study of adequate quality, and the scientific evidence
regarding their respective effect was therefore insufficient.
Effects of Selective Prevention Trials
Nine different prevention programs were tested in 17 selective trials that met our inclusion
criteria, and their results are summarized in Table 3.
Trials of the parent training programs Triple P and Incredible Years allowed for meta-
analyses, as presented in Figs. 2, 3. Both programs reduced symptoms of externalizing
problems in preschool children, who had minor to moderate social problems, for at least
12 months. The effects were small to medium (Fig. 2). The Incredible Years had been
tested only in socio-economically disadvantaged environments. In those contexts, the
program had a small effect on symptoms of externalizing problems in pre-school children,
rated by blind observers at least 8 months post intervention (Fig. 3). Symptom ratings by
parents suggested that the program had little or no effect (Fig. 2).
Selective trials targeting families affected by internal stress (Parent Management
Training/PMT, New Beginnings, Family Bereavement Program, Adolescents and Their
Parents with Aids, considered together) reduced externalizing behavior in the children at
least 11 months post intervention. The average effects were small.
The review did not allow for conclusions regarding the effects of any other program
subject to a selective trial, since the remaining studies were too heterogeneous to be pooled
in a meta-analysis.
Booster sessions were reported for a few of the selective trials, with variable results.
One extra session of IY 1 year after program termination reported no effect, whereas a
complete repeat trial of SAFE Children 3 years later reported a small but significant effect.
Effects of Indicated Prevention Trials
The effects of 11 programs were tested in a total of 16 indicated trials of adequate quality.
Another 25 indicated trials met the inclusion criteria, but were of insufficient quality to
contribute to the scientific evidence. Included trials represented family support programs,
school programs, and multimodal programs. The results are summarized in Table 4 and
Fig. 4.
The Family Check-Up (FCU), a family support program, was based on a structured
three-session assessment and feedback intervention, but could also provide individually
tailored continued support, and treatment. Three large trials of FCU were included in the
review, showing reduced symptoms of externalizing behavior in children and adolescents
for at least 12 months. The effects were of medium size.
Coping Power was subject to two trials, primarily implemented within the school
curricula but with complementary supportive education targeting parents and teachers. It
reduced the degree of externalizing behavior in schoolchildren for up to 12 months, with
medium effects. However, sample sizes were small, and the attrition rates were 30­45 %.

Long-Term Outcome
Eight selective or indicated trials, of which seven are presented in Tables 3 and 4, had been
subject to long-term follow-up studies with at least one observation 5 years or longer after

program termination. In the case of Fast Track, there had been consecutive observations
during a 10-year long intervention, complemented with a follow-up 3 years post
intervention.
These studies reported a lower incidence of psychiatric diagnoses (Fast Track, GBG and
New Beginnings), better school attendance (Montreal Prevention Project), lower incidence
of delinquency (PMT) and overall problem behaviors (Family Check-up), and a higher
employment rate and self-support (Adolescents and Their Parent with AIDS). However,
the long-term effects were small and typically found only on occasional outcome measures.
An eighth trial, the Seattle Development Project, presented a special case with one
extremely long-term follow-up study. The program aimed at preventing antisocial ado-
lescent behavior through an intervention delivered in different steps during grades 1­6.
Initially, the study was randomized, but was converted into a quasi-experimental design
when additional cohorts were recruited. Long-term observations were made when partic-
ipants were 18, 21, 24 and 27 years (Hawkins et al. 1999, 2005, 2008). Despite an explicit
program aim to prevent externalizing problems, positive long-term effects mostly con-
cerned internalizing problems. At age 27, significantly fewer psychiatric diagnoses were
reported for those who had participated throughout grades 1­6.

Negative Effects
The literature search on negative effects of prevention programs rendered 534 abstracts. In
the end, ten studies constituted the scientific evidence for negative effects; a few of them
were also part of the assessment of prevention effects. Typically, the reports on negative
effects were based on incidental findings, which ran contrary to expectation. Early on,
Dishion and colleagues reported an unexpected increase in externalizing symptoms and
disruptive behavior in 11­14 years old participants in a group intervention for youths at
high risk, the Adolescent Transition Program (Dishion and Andrews 1995; see Table 4).
Program involvement of parents was reported to have a small but protective effect.
Additional longitudinal studies of ATP, including a follow-up of the Cambridge-Somer-
ville Youth Study, have confirmed these findings (Dishion et al. 1999, 2001). In the same
vein, Warren and colleagues reported that parental involvement is intrinsic to and elimi-
nates iatrogenic effects of Families and Schools Together (Warren et al. 2006).
Cavell and colleagues reported that the Prime Time group intervention made low-risk
group participants more accepting of aggressive and disruptive behaviors (Cavell and
Hughes 2000; see Table 4). Two studies of PALS, a social skills training program
administered in a group format, reported that program participation increased the risk for
negative peer interactions and use of drugs (Palinkas et al. 1996). Mager et al. (2005) found
iatrogenic effects only in high-risk youths participating in group interventions together
with well-adjusted peers, and suggested that the group composition fueled their negative
self-image.
Three studies, all limited in size, reported that selective or indicated prevention pro-
grams may have negative effects on the family system, with increased stress, tension and
conflicts between other family members (Mockford and Barlow 2004; Helfenbaum-Kun
and Ortiz 2007; Szapocznik and Prado 2007).
Discussion
This systematic review of prevention programs targeting externalizing problems in chil-
dren lends limited support to their effects. Among several hundreds of prevention programs
investigated and reported in the international literature, only 24 programs met our inclusion
criteria. In fact, only five of them had been subject to more than one trial of sufficient
quality, which showed positive results, a requisite for drawing conclusions regarding
specific program effect. These five programs include two parent training programs
(Incredible Years and Triple P), a family support program (Family Check-Up), and two
school programs (GBG and Coping Power). In addition, a small group of studies, con-
sidered together, indicate that family support programs (i.e. PMT) aimed at families
undergoing a period of increased stress may prevent externalizing mental ill-health in
children. Overall, effect sizes were small.
Our results may seem at odds with previous meta-analyses, which have tended to report
larger and more unanimously positive program effects. What may account for these
diverging results? First, our analysis was designed to evaluate preventive effects only, and
excluded treatment studies, where effect sizes are usually more impressive. Second, only
studies with outcome measures concerning the children's externalizing problems were
included; presumed mediators such as parenting skills, or parent or teacher satisfaction,
were not accepted as primary outcome measures. Third, we excluded programs that were
solely targeting antisocial behaviors, with substance abuse or delinquency as outcome
270 Child Youth Care Forum (2015) 44:251­276
123
measures, and that had no assessment of mental health. Fourth, we only included studies
that met the specified quality criteria regarding control and analysis of confounders,
attrition rates and ITT-analysis. Fifth, and most importantly, we used a follow-up period of
at least 6 months as a critical inclusion criterion, to exclude merely transitory effects.
Considering that many of the programs in the analysis intervene in preschool or early
school years with an ultimate goal to prevent the development of externalizing problems in
adolescence, this seems like a fairly modest criterion.
Limited evidence for effect must not be taken as a proof that prevention programs are
useless. Rather, it demonstrates that our knowledge about the effects of the programs is
disturbingly meager. Scientists and practitioners concerned with the wellbeing of children
should be encouraged to conduct well-designed trials, which include follow-up assess-
ments conducted at least 6 months after program termination.
The few long-term follow-up studies that have been conducted lend some, albeit
unsystematic, support to the belief that prevention programs may indeed make a difference.
The results are, however, inconclusive, due to the small number of studies and also to the
fact that effects measured at one specific point in time tend to be difficult to replicate
during consecutive follow-ups. A given outcome measure may be relevant at one devel-
opmental stage, and of subordinate interest at another, posing significant theoretical and
methodological challenges.
Prevention programs are delivered at different levels of intervention. The prevention
literature at large indicates that universal prevention produces smaller effect sizes per
observation unit, since the great majority of the general population is unaffected by the
problem targeted. Therefore, the effects of universal prevention can only be tested in very
large-scale trials. Evaluations of programs for children at risk, in indicated or selective
trials, are less demanding in terms of resources and are likely to produce higher effect
sizes. However, our meta-analysis lends weak general support for indicated prevention,
and there was no sign that brief, indicated trials of single-component programs had any
effect at all. On the other hand, data from Fast Track and Family Check-up trials, support
the idea that sustainable indicated prevention may benefit children who are most at risk. In
summary, our meta-analysis did not allow for any conclusions about preferable prevention
level, primarily because of the small number of universal prevention trials of sufficient size
and scientific quality.
The length of the parent support programs varied greatly from 1 month to several years,
sometimes including ``booster sessions'', but variations in effect may have more to do with
the socio-cultural context of the studies than the length and intensity of the programs.
Studies of Triple P, a program that has been evaluated primarily in middle class settings,
have typically reported larger effects than studies of the Incredible Years program, which
has almost exclusively been evaluated in disadvantaged families.
Externalizing symptoms have a strong male preponderance. Accordingly, most of the
study populations in this systematic review had an uneven gender distribution, and five
studies focused entirely on boys. No program in our analysis had developed gender specific
approaches, and gender effect analyses were rare. Thus, the available evidence in support
of the effect of preventive programs targeting externalizing problems relies heavily on
effects in boys.
The possibility for negative or unwanted effects must always be taken into account. It is
well documented that aggregating at-risk children and adolescents for group interventions
may result in a negative outcome, through social contagion (Dishion et al. 2001). Although
less well researched, there is also reason to be aware that interventions aimed at parents
may disrupt the balance in a fragile family system. To date, very few intervention trials
Child Youth Care Forum (2015) 44:251­276 271
123
have included a systematic procedure for reporting of iatrogenic effects, and it is fair to
assume that our knowledge of harmful consequences is quite limited. An obvious rec-
ommendation for future trials is to include protocols for observation and systematic
reporting also of unwanted outcomes.
Methodological Shortcomings and Challenges
Evaluating preventive effects poses a number of significant methodological and practical
challenges. Since lower effect sizes are to be expected, prevention trials generally demand
larger study populations than do clinical treatment trials. Cluster randomization is one
strategy to handle this problem, but interferes with the basic assumption of independence
between observation units, if not handled properly in the statistical analysis. Quite a few of
the included studies had unbalanced study groups, with higher initial symptom levels in the
intervention group compared to controls, despite adequate randomization procedures. This
suggests that a regression to the mean may be part of the calculated effects, e.g. in the trials
of Triple P. Another problem is that some studies present only a few out of many potential
outcome measures, which raises questions about selective reporting of variables.
A major limitation in the literature is the shortage of studies reporting long-term out-
come. Admittedly, there are a number of difficulties with longitudinal designs in pre-
vention research. Maintaining study cohorts over of time is a demanding undertaking,
involving sustainable logistics, at considerable costs. In reality, research funding is rarely
granted for more than a few years at a time, allowing only for brief follow-up periods, at
best. Furthermore, longitudinal studies present some purely scientific challenges of their
own, conceptual as well as methodological. A linear relationship between a specific
intervention and long-term outcome is not to be expected. Inventories measuring psychi-
atric symptoms at early school age may not be valid measures of mental health later in
childhood, whereas school attendance and performance, as well as psychiatric diagnoses
and overall social adjustment are of increasing importance during adolescence.
In most of the included trials, the program developers themselves had been actively
involved, indicating a risk for allegiance effects. There is an obvious need for more
effectiveness studies, carried out by independent researchers.
Conclusions and Future Directions
In spite of a vast research literature, the scientific evidence for lasting effects of prevention
programs targeting externalizing problems in children and adolescents is limited. A mere
handful of programs have been subject to more than one well-controlled trial with adequate
follow-up. There is a need for well-designed studies that evaluate lasting effects in
effectiveness studies, and address whether universal or selective/indicated approaches
should be preferred, and whether there is a risk for negative consequences from program
participation. Evaluation studies for prevention programs should include follow-up mea-
sures no less than 6 months post intervention, and preferably at several points in time, for
both intervention and control groups, allowing for analysis of developmental trajectories
and maintenance of the attained effects. Future meta-analyses in this field need to clearly
differentiate between different levels of intervention, specify inclusion criteria accordingly,
and limit conclusions to the level in focus.
Finally, funding agencies need to be made aware of the high costs involved in
addressing the methodological problems mentioned above. Quality prevention research is
272 Child Youth Care Forum (2015) 44:251­276
123
dependent on sustainable funding. A lack of commitment on the part of funding sources is
a major obstacle for the development and implementation of prevention programs based on
sound scientific evidence.
