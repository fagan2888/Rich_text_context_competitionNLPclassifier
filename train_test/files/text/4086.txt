Abstract
This article looks at how global flows of people and policies affect penal subjectivity among prisoners
in Lithuania. Those who had previously been incarcerated abroad perceive their punishment
in Lithuania's reforming penal system in comparative terms. We find that international prison
experience may either diminish or increase the sense of the severity of the current punishment.
Respondents often felt more comfortable in a familiar culture of punishment in Lithuania that
emphasizes autonomy and communality. Moreover, internationalized prisoners perceive prison
reform emulating West European models as a threat to this culture and are able to articulate
comparative critiques of this reform and contest its effects.

Introduction
The question that guides this article is as follows: how has heightened mobility of people
and penal policies in Europe shaped not only the prison societies of migrant-receiving
countries in the rich West and North but also the migrant-sending countries of the poorer

East and South? Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with former migrants from
Lithuania who have been incarcerated abroad and are now in the Lithuanian prison sys-
tem, the article aims to discuss this question. The article shows that in Lithuania under-
standings of punishment are framed in comparative and international terms. This is for
two reasons; firstly, the high prevalence of former migrants in prison who have been
incarcerated abroad, and, secondly, the effects on prisoners of large-scale reform of the
Lithuanian penitentiary system towards a `European'model. To make sense of these fac-
tors, the article frames respondent narratives in the growing bodies of literature in crimi-
nology concerning crime and migration in the emerging criminology of mobility (Aas
and Bosworth, 2013; Bosworth, 2012; Bowling, 2013; Kaufman, 2014; Stumpf, 2006;
Weber and Pickering, 2006), as well as work on the global flow of criminological exper-
tise and policy (Bowling and Sheptycki, 2012; Jones and Newburn, 2002; Melossi et al.,
2011; Sparks and Newburn, 2002).
The article argues that international flows of both prisoners and penal policies has
implications for the emerging work on penal consciousness or penal subjectivity, which
addresses the variability in the ways in which punishment is experienced (Crewe, 2011,
2012; Sexton, 2012, 2015; Hayes, 2016). The key claim made in the article is that penal
subjectivity ­ the meanings, orientations and understandings of punishment ­ is no
longer shaped only by the penal power of the given state in which a particular prison is
located. Instead, the perceptions of the severity and salience of punishment are becoming
internationalized `in a world of global mobility' (Bosworth, 2012: 126).
The article is structured as follows. Firstly, we provide a discussion of the literature
and suggest certain gaps that this article aims to speak to. We then give an overview of
the Lithuanian case, which establishes that Lithuania is a high emigration country that is
undergoing major penal reform. The article then produces an analysis of prisoner narra-
tives concerning their punishment in Lithuania and the comparative perspective these
narratives offer. Finally, we discuss perceptions of Lithuania's prison reform. We show
that prisoners use a comparative lens to understand this; they feel that reforms conducted
in the name of becoming `European' often do not produce the same outcomes as in the
Europe that the prisoners are all too familiar with. In conclusion, we suggest that the
internationalization of penal subjectivity might be of interest to criminologists working
in a range of subfields.
Globalization and penal identities
A fast-growing literature within criminology concerns mobility, migration and criminal
justice responses to these (Aas and Bosworth, 2013; Bosworth, 2011, 2012; Kaufman,
2014; Melossi, 2003; Stumpf, 2006; Weber and Pickering, 2006). This literature con-
vincingly argues that punishment and criminal justice logics have become central to
immigration control, in turn reshaping understandings of belonging and citizenship. As
Kaufman (2014) writes, the basic premise of the criminology of mobility is that globali-
zation has altered the relationship between punishment and identity. In an age of globali-
zation, punishment exacerbates differences of race and ethnicity, reconfiguring gendered
identities and their relationship with nationality and citizenship. The writing in this area
focuses on the reproduction of global inequalities and the effects on identity of those
Slade and Vaicinien 219
`othered' by exclusionary measures such as deportation regimes, immigration removal
centres and the differential management of foreign nationals in prison. Related to this,
some studies also attempt to explain the increasing proportion of foreign prisoners in the
prison populations of Western Europe, linking this to political economic and institutional
factors (De Giorgi, 2010; Lacey, 2008; Wacquant, 1999).
A further body of literature, somewhat separately, charts the effects of globalization
on the circulation of criminological ideas, technologies and `expert systems' (Giddens,
1990). Notwithstanding the embedded cultures of punishment that exist in national con-
texts (Garland, 1993; Nelken, 2011; Smith, 2008), diffusion and transfer across jurisdic-
tions is commonplace whether in policing strategies, prison design or sentencing policies
(Bowling and Sheptycki, 2012; Jones and Newburn, 2002; Melossi et al., 2011;Wacquant,
2009). Such diffusion is often accompanied by internationalized slogans such as `zero
tolerance', `no frills prisons' or `broken windows'. Although many studies point to the
international spread of US approaches to criminal justice (Downes, 2001; Jones and
Newburn, 2002; Karstedt, 2002), the European Union (EU) has also endeavoured to cre-
ate a unified `area of justice' that supposes a degree of convergence and uniformity in
crime control and punishment (Baker, 2013; Snacken and Van Zyl Smit, 2009).
Despite these growing bodies of literature, Bosworth (2012: 125) writes that `many
researchers in [the punishment and society] field have ... been slow to recognize the
impact of globalization on structures, practices and experiences of punishment' [our ital-
ics]. The gap in our knowledge concerning shifting penal experiences in conditions of
global flows of people and ideas is one of the key objects of study for the criminology of
mobility. This article offers a case study from a non-Western jurisdiction. The case of
Lithuania shows that subjective experiences of punishment in predominantly migrant-
sending countries are also changing significantly owing to global mobility. Moreover,
migrant-sending countries are most likely to be poorer and positioned on the receiving
end of flows of global expertise, including reform pressure from the EU and policy pro-
motion from political and civil entrepreneurs.
The Lithuanian case demonstrates how flows of people and ideas impact penal sub-
jectivity or penal consciousness ­ the experience of something as punishment and the
meaning ascribed to that punishment (Sexton, 2015). For socio-legal and jurisprudential
theorists, penal subjectivity concerns measuring the variable degree of individual suf-
fering at the hands of the state so as to establish the justness of a particular sanction
(Grabosky, 1978; Hayes, 2016; Kolber, 2009). The pains of imprisonment are not the
same for everyone and are experienced subjectively across a range of dimensions
(Crewe, 2011, 2012). In this vein, Lori Sexton, following prior distinctions concerning
the law as it is in action compared with on paper, has tried to understand the lived reali-
ties of `punishment in action' as against `punishment on the books' (Sexton, 2015: 117).
She argues that the severity, or the intensity, of punishment and the salience, or the
prominence, of the punishment in everyday life differ from prisoner to prisoner. The
degree to which a prisoner feels the intensity and salience of punishment depends on
`the punishment gap'. This refers to the degree to which each individual's expectation
of punishment and the actual experience of punishment diverge. Expectations, for
Sexton, are determined by vicarious knowledge and comparison with other prisoners'
punishment as well as prior experience.
220 European Journal of Criminology 15(2)
The article aims to build on Sexton's theory concerning the variability of penal sub-
jectivity and the role of comparison in penal suffering. We develop the theory by arguing
that such comparison can have an international dimension under conditions of globaliza-
tion. Our two central propositions are, firstly, that international experience of prison
enables comparison of punishment across jurisdictions, differences in these experiences
will affect expectations and hence the punishment gap; and, secondly, that international
experience of prison provides the basis to critique and resist penal policy innovation as
well as to adjust expectations of these innovations'effects on experiences of punishment.
Lithuania provides a critical case study to explore these propositions. Below we intro-
duce the case study and show why Lithuania is a particularly appropriate case for under-
standing the penal impact of global mobility in a non-Western European context.
Lithuania: International emigration and domestic prison
reform
Lithuania is a country of 3 million people that, apart from Latvia and Estonia, is the only
EU member state to have been a Soviet republic. Like many former communist states,
Lithuania has been a net emigration country since 1990. It is estimated that 825,000
people have left the country since that time (Europas migracijos tinklas, 2013). However,
emigration is often not permanent. Immigration into Lithuania mostly comprises return-
ing migrants and their number steadily increased through the 2000s; it has seen a signifi-
cant upward trend since 2010 and reached its highest point in 2014 when 24,294 people
returned, up from 5553 in 2004.
Lithuanians have migrated to many countries. One of the main destinations has been the
UK. Rasinger's (2010) study of UK press coverage has shown that Lithuanians have been
portrayed as quintessential criminal migrants. Lithuanians are over-represented in the UK
prison system: they comprise 2.8 percent of the UK's foreign-citizen population yet make
up 4.9 percent of the UK's foreign prisoner population (Giannangeli, 2013). Siegel's study
of itinerant criminals in the Netherlands showed that Lithuanians featured the most promi-
nently in police statistics for migrant crime, followed by Poland, Bulgaria and Romania
(Siegel, 2014, 2015). This article is not concerned with trying to understand why some
Lithuanians turn to criminality once abroad. These statistics from the Netherlands and the
UK merely establish that Lithuania can fairly be portrayed as an EU member state that has
a highly mobile population and that some Lithuanians indeed fall foul of the law in some
receiving countries, experiencing life in prison in those countries.
In Lithuania itself, the penitentiary system is in the throes of reform driven by inter-
national expertise. At 315 prisoners per 100,000 of the population, the Lithuanian peni-
tentiary system proportionately holds the most prisoners in the EU (International Centre
for Prison Studies, 2014). As a comparison, Germany, one of the main destination coun-
tries for Lithuanians, holds 76 prisoners per 100,000 of the population. The majority of
the 9700 prisoners in Lithuania are held in houses of correction; these were known in
Soviet times as correctional colonies (Sakalauskas, 2014).1 Correctional houses occupy
large areas that contain both industrial and living `zones'. Convicted prisoners are held
in dormitories, rather like barracks, housing between 10 and 20 people and sometimes
Slade and Vaicinien 221
more. Two or three dormitories make up a prisoner detachment, which in Soviet times
would have worked shifts together. Prisoners are able to leave their dorms for almost the
whole day, walking in their `local sector', a separated area containing a set number of
dormitories and communal areas. At night prisoners are able to go out into the corridor
because bathrooms are outside the dorms. The majority of prisoners do not wear uni-
forms, they have access to a shop with no limit on their daily spend, and they can have
personal effects such as games consoles. They are allowed to use computers for up to
three hours a day, though with no Internet access.
Staff supervision is relatively minimal, with `controllers' or guards doing the rounds
through the local sectors at various times in the day. The large grounds and open space
of the zone, combined with the relatively self-regulated prison life, mean that illicit
mobile phones and drugs come over the wall and are rife in Lithuanian prisons. Some
informal legacies of the Soviet period are also still present; there is a relatively rigid caste
system in place. Subcultural codes frame social practices and interactions. Individual
prison administrations still employ officers as `operatives' who recruit prisoners to
become informers, a very Soviet version of dynamic security.
Lithuania has taken a soft and slow approach to reforming the collectivist aspects of
the Soviet-style colonies. The country signed up to a number of international obligations
as part of its integration into the EU, NATO and the Council of Europe. The carrot of EU
membership, which came about in 2004, stimulated further reforms. A new Lithuanian
Code of the Execution of Penalties was introduced in 2003, as was a new Criminal Code
(Sakalauskas, 2014). Expert commentators believe that since that time reform processes
have stalled despite demands from EU institutions to reform the Soviet remnants in the
system.2 The condition of Lithuanian correctional colonies has been used as grounds to
appeal extradition. Violence in the system, owing to the open nature of the colonies and
the system of castes that still exists, has brought successful litigation against the govern-
ment by prisoners in the European Court of Human Rights (see, for example, Tautkus vs.
Lithuania, 2009).
Yet, there are still intentions to reform the system. Much of this comes with interna-
tional expertise. Sweden and Canada have been instrumental in assisting with alterna-
tives to prison, improving juvenile justice and creating a probation service. With the help
of Norwegian financing, for example, halfway house open colonies are being imple-
mented. However, the real essence of these reform plans is a move to a `cell system'.
Currently this is planned for completion in 2022, though much scepticism remains. The
plan involves a major period of new building and renovation of old buildings. The aim is
to move prisoners out of barracks and provide closed living and social spaces along West
European lines. Principles and practices of `dynamic security', with the assistance of
Norwegian funding, will replace the guards on prison fences (Prison Department of
Lithuania, 2015). The process of closing off the wide spaces of the colony has been in
progress since Lithuanian independence. Prison administrations have continually erected
physical barriers to produce higher numbers of so-called `local sectors' with fewer pris-
oners in them in order to undermine the caste system. Some sectors are designated to
hold people in the higher caste, who live by Soviet criminal traditions, in an attempt to
isolate and control the influence of this form of extra-legal prison governance.

Lithuania then represents a country affected intimately by the globalized mobility of
people and policies. The article now seeks to understand how these processes affect
Lithuanian prisoners' penal subjectivity. We will look at the internationalization of the
penal experience of prisoners in Lithuania and how this affects the gap between expecta-
tions and realities of punishment. We then turn to how mobility produces competing
assessments among prisoners of internationally informed penal reform efforts and under-
standings of what a `better' system should look like. Before we turn to examine these
issues, we briefly discuss the data that the subsequent analysis is based upon.
Data and methods
The data for the following sections come from a qualitative study of prison social life
during reform in selected post-Soviet countries. Lithuania was one of the case studies in
this project. In total, 56 in-depth interviews were carried out by the authors in Lithuania:
5 of these were with experts (current and former policy makers and practitioners), 13
were with staff, including prison guards, social workers and a prison director, and 38
were conducted with prisoners across three penal institutions (all correctional houses)
during a one-month period. The three institutions were Alytus and Marijampol, correc-
tional houses mainly for recidivists, high-risk offenders and drug addicts, and
Pravienisks, mainly holding first-time offenders. Interviews lasted 1 hour in most cases
and were conducted in Lithuanian or Russian.
Questions focused on social relationships in the context of reforming Soviet-style bar-
racks and `local sectors'. Questions were also asked about knowledge of government
plans to construct a cell system and prisoner views about this. Upon analysis of the inter-
views we found that 39 percent (n = 15) of prisoner respondents had served a sentence
abroad in a total of 11 different countries; 4 had experience of prison in multiple countries
other than Lithuania. Every one of the 15 had spent time in a prison in another EU country.
Three also had experience of other post-Soviet countries' prison systems, and two had
been in prison during Soviet times. This variation in experience is shown in Table 1.
This sample of prisoners with international experience was random; we did not select
prisoners with such experience intentionally. However, we do not believe that the per-
centage of those with prison experience abroad in our sample is somehow representative
of the percentage of such prisoners in the broader Lithuanian prison population. There
are a number of selection biases. Firstly, prisoners were selected with the help of social
workers, and the more assertive and talkative prisoners often self-selected to be inter-
viewed. These types of qualities might also be important for a decision to emigrate.
Secondly, the average age of our sample (33 years) was slightly older than the total
prison population average (around 29 in 2012), and this may also have skewed the num-
ber of respondents we had with foreign prison experience. We do not include respondents
with no foreign prison experience in our analysis. However, these respondents also had
vicarious knowledge of foreign prisons from others.
Lithuania is a very particular case that might not be straightforwardly generalizable.
It is a post-Soviet republic and therefore has a more distinct culture of punishment than
other European jurisdictions. It has a particularly high level of out-migration (Europas
migracijos tinklas, 2013). Yet, in terms of migration Lithuania is far from unique,
Slade and Vaicinien 223
particularly in comparison to the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. Thus,
although the following analysis is of a single case, the insights might be applicable to
other places outside Lithuania.
In what follows we focus mainly on prisoners' comparisons between Lithuanian and
West European prisons; we include Estonia in this latter category because its prison sys-
tem has been reformed to a cell type and no longer maintains Soviet-era colonies. On
these grounds, Latvia, Belarus and Russia do not qualify as `European' but these cases
are still brought into the analysis where relevant and for comparative purposes. When
providing excerpts from interviews, we give respondents a changed name, state the
prison where the interview took place and the foreign prison systems of which the
respondent had experience.
Comparative perspectives and penal subjectivity
Respondent accounts demonstrated that the gap between expectations and the reality of
punishment was indeed mediated by the comparative experience of prison abroad.
However, the gap could be widened or shortened by the experience and this varied
according to the individual or the particular punitive referent ­ the given object that elic-
ited a sense of being punished (Sexton, 2015) ­ in question. For some, the prisons of
Western Europe were seen as `luxury' in terms of material conditions, privacy and secu-
rity. For others, prison in Lithuania fitted with cultural expectations of punishment, eas-
ing the experience compared with what they had experienced abroad. Moreover, the
architectural style of the Soviet colony provided greater communality and freedom. This
section will highlight both types of perception, drawing on the narratives of the prisoners
themselves. The comparative narratives that the prisoners told revolved around certain
central concepts that frame the discussion below. These are: dignity, autonomy, commu-
nality, order, privacy and identity.
Respondents compared their treatment by staff and expressed a sense of greater inhu-
manity and indignity at their treatment in Lithuania when compared with abroad. In other

countries, respondents reported that staff had behaved in a more `cultured' manner. In
Lithuania, some respondents mentioned being viewed and addressed as non-human. As
one respondent, who had been transferred from Estonia to Lithuania on his own request,
explained:
When I got here [Lithuania] I almost went crazy, I thought I'd landed back in the Soviet Union!
The beds are dirty. And the guards were always shouting. The whole night I was sitting there
thinking, we had it was all so clean and well appointed [in Estonia]. And I thought, fuck me,
why did I come here?!
(Petras, Pravienisks ­ Estonia)3
Expectations about how to be treated, based on experiences abroad, were wide of the
reality and hence exacerbated the punishment gap once back in Lithuania. Respondents
also drew comparisons between management techniques and practices of formal govern-
ance of the prison population and how these affected their sense of being punished. One
respondent who had been in prison in Belarus and Sweden found Belarus to be more
comparable to Lithuania precisely in the methods of managing the prisoners and every-
day routine:
I understand it now. The type of prison you have, the type of state it is ... Sweden, well, of
course, it's heaven you can say. It's so calm! Whereas here, [t]here are some things from Soviet
times, like the roll call. Why force people out for a roll call when you have every opportunity
to count them normally like they do in Europe?
(Valery, Alytus ­ Belarus, Sweden)
After the conditions of prisons in Western Europe, perhaps the main element of disil-
lusionment was the material conditions in the often decrepit and old colonies of Lithuania.
The food was a point of contention, as was cleanliness. Owing to the poor food, condi-
tions in the dormitories and distant and hostile relations with staff, prisoners in Lithuania,
as in Soviet times, maintain a sense of self-reliance. Yet, while this produced relative
deprivation in relation to material conditions and well-being, self-help and autonomy
could also be important sources of dignity that some respondents felt had been denied to
them when abroad. Thus, some suggested they had lost a sense of independence while
abroad that could be rediscovered in the colony in Lithuania.
In Germany ... nobody makes decisions themselves, they are not taught to do this ... if someone
has an issue they shout to the guard... I mean, they are not capable of resolving their own
issues. And when it's like that, when people tell you exactly how to live then when you get out
it's going to be even harder to live isn't it? Because you'll be used to having people doing things
for you... But [in Lithuania] you can go outside get a book, watch TV, just sit and chat.
(Jonas, Alytus ­ Germany)
As this respondent suggests, the cell systems of prisons in Western Europe did not
necessarily fit with what Lithuanians expected from punishment. A cell system for
Slade and Vaicinien 225
Lithuanians, as for other post-Soviet nationalities, is associated with Soviet use of cells.
The Soviets used cells exclusively for police investigation units, remand or the segrega-
tion unit in colonies. Thus, cells represent extreme dependence, vulnerability, extra pun-
ishment, and a sense of loss of dignity and autonomy. Transfer to a colony represented a
move to a more open space, dormitory living, heightened interaction and greater
autonomy:
You can walk around in this big sector, you can go down to the yard ... somebody is watching
a movie or playing dominos in the sector ... You take some fresh air or you go to the gym or
visit somebody for a cup of tea. It is a different situation when you are in a closed cell.
(Vytautas, Alytus ­ England)
Some respondents, arriving in Lithuanian colonies from cell systems, describe a sense
of relief and the colony as `small freedom'. The desire for the perceived freedom and
autonomy in a colony moved two respondents to request transfers back to Lithuania. One
respondent decided he wanted a move back to Lithuania from Estonia after discussing it
with other Lithuanian prisoners there because, as he put it, `[Lithuania] still has the camp
system, it's open, you can go out in the yard, use telephones, everything is possible'
(Petras, Pravienisks ­ Estonia). A separate respondent did not like the reformed cell sys-
tem of Estonia because of the restrictions on activity and movement. He was transferred
back to Pravienisks, a large colony (1400 prisoners) in central Lithuania, even though
family members remained behind in Estonia:
In Estonia I was inside for two and a half [years] ­ in a cell ... it's enough! I asked to be moved
here because this is a colony, I live here like I'm at home ... Now I want to walk and walk and
walk. It's freedom here. It is. I feel freedom.
(Gintaras, Pravienisks ­ Estonia)
For both of these respondents, the punishment gap was narrowed significantly by the
familiarity of Lithuanian punitive practices compared with those elsewhere. These two
respondents had similar histories of transfer from the same place, Estonia, but very dif-
ferent reasons for wanting the transfer. Gintaras was particularly athletic and simply felt
that the colony suited him better to be active. He reported that he was something of a
loner and not interested in involving himself in the subcultural caste system or gangs that
are prevalent in Lithuanian colonies. Although he wanted the freedom of movement of
the colony, he did not want the interaction. The other respondent, Petras, lived by the
subcultural `understandings' of Soviet times, supported the caste system, but felt he was
better able to express this in the interactive everyday life of the Lithuanian colony rather
than in Estonian cells where the subculture had weakened. Thus, the sense of closing the
punishment gap for one was about the freedom to be active, for the other it was about the
ease of achieving social respect and standing in a familiar context. Both of these respond-
ents worked with an implicit comparative understanding of what punishment was to
them as Lithuanians while in prison abroad. This understanding grounded their justifica-
tions for requesting transfers to Lithuania.
226 European Journal of Criminology 15(2)
Although freedom and autonomy may be one advantage of the Lithuanian colony
compared with international experiences, order and privacy are not so well guaranteed
and appear to exacerbate the punishment gap after prison abroad. In the communal con-
ditions of the colony, order depends on strong subcultural understandings and informal
institutions. Yet, deliberate problematizing and targeting by prison administrations has
significantly weakened these structures. In Lithuania, a decline in the generalized Soviet
inmate code has led to an increase in the presence of city- or region-based gangs who
exist in wary equilibrium of each other. Moreover, drugs are a big problem for the main-
tenance of order but appear to be highly prevalent and largely un-policed in the auton-
omy of the dormitory and local sector. Thus, many respondents found, relative to their
experiences abroad, that order was not guaranteed in such a system:
Sometimes [other prisoners] will just take things off you, your clothes ... There are people in
here who have been sitting two or three years without meeting anyone, they never come out,
they close themselves off completely from this system. There are so many like that. Out of fear.
(Daumantas, Alytus ­ Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)
Staff respondents corroborated this claim. They reported that some prisoners deliber-
ately broke rules to engineer a move to the segregation unit in order to be removed from
their dormitories and placed in a cell. Milhaud and Moran (2013) report similar findings
in Russian prisons operating colonies similar to those in Lithuania. Violence is difficult
to measure but it is certainly a problem that has been highlighted in a number of cases
that relate directly to the control that the prisoner caste system still exerts. Some cases
have gone to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), where the Lithuanian state
has been found culpable for failing to provide protection from gangs or caste-based vic-
timization (for example, Tautkus vs. Lithuania 2009; Human Rights Europe, 2015).
Conflict can stem from a lack of privacy. This is clear to any visitor to a colony dormi-
tory, where prisoners clearly try to create their own space with bed sheets and towels only
to have these taken down when the controllers come around for a check-up. Lack of pri-
vacy and overcrowding have been other substantial grounds for cases that have gone to the
ECHR (see Mironovas and others vs. Lithuania 2015). Although the ECHR in some of
these cases notes the poor conditions within the dormitories, it also recognizes that the free
movement and space provided by the colony during the day can offset the ill effects of the
poor indoor environment. Nevertheless, in such a situation, with a deteriorating subculture
and a weakening of the attendant normative strictures on the use of violence, frustrations
with co-inhabitants can boil over. In cases of conflict, prisoners may simply move of their
own accord during the day to spend time in other dorms, coming back to their `detachment'
only to sleep. In some respects, this also demonstrates a level of autonomy and freedom of
association. However, other prisoners or gangs may also force such movement. For prison-
ers with international experience this compared badly with their experience abroad, where
they were moved in the event of conflict and generally had less interaction.
In Germany, for example, you can say, I don't like you and don't want to see you and they will
move you. It's written in the law there that you can choose ... but here every day you see that
Slade and Vaicinien 227
same person ... and you feel that tension every day and you can't get out of it. [The staff] will
tell you, you have to stay here, they can do it on purpose even, as an extra punishment.
(Daumantas, Alytus ­ Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)
Many respondents made this claim of extraordinary and informal punishment through
forcing bad company on troublesome individuals. Thus, those who, while abroad, had
felt relatively empowered in choosing whom they shared physical space with keenly felt
a lack of privacy back in Lithuania. Yet, for some, considerations of privacy versus
autonomy were not as important as a general sense of familiar personal identity when
back in Lithuania. In line with findings from studies of foreign nationals in UK prisons
and detention centres (Bosworth, 2011; Bosworth and Slade, 2014; Kaufman, 2014),
Lithuanians in prison abroad often felt that their status as non-citizens stigmatized them
and created insecurities they simply did not feel back in Lithuania. Furthermore, for
many the diversity of prisoners in Western prisons, highlighted by scholars of the crimi-
nology of mobility, created problems of integration, belonging and mutual recognition
and respect. This was especially true in comparison with the simpler caste system and
ethnic homogeneity of Lithuanian prisons.
Thus, one respondent had wanted to be removed from UK prison as quickly as he
could, despite his wife living in the country. The same forces of globalization and mobil-
ity that had brought him to the UK had created a diversity and cultural mix that he was
uncomfortable with. He preferred the relatively straightforward ethnic relations of
Lithuanian colonies comprising mainly Lithuanian prisoners alongside minority groups
of Poles and Russians.
In England the judge ... said that there is a lot of talk about the conditions [in Lithuanian
prisons] and so maybe they will not need to deport me to Lithuania. But I wanted to come back
to Lithuania as soon as possible ... because [in the UK] there are, you know, Muslims and it is
not acceptable for me to sit with those kinds of people ... I do not want to be inside with black
people or Muslims.
(Vytautas, Alytus ­ England)
Compared with Lithuania, racial and ethnic mixing was experienced as part of the pun-
ishment for this respondent, threatening and diluting any sense of identity other than a
foreign national prisoner. Social relations inside the Lithuanian colony were easier to
negotiate and on the respondent's return home the punishment gap, on this measure, was
shortened. The issue of identity then, along with the more familiar philosophy and prac-
tices of punishment, was an important factor in mediating the subjective experience of
prison upon return home.
There are then ambiguities in the subjective experience of punishment that incar-
cerated returned migrants feel. These ambiguities stem from the fundamental differ-
ences in the cultures of punishment in Western Europe compared with the post-Soviet
region, born out of two different visions of penal modernization in capitalist and
communist societies. These differences relate to dignity, autonomy and communality,
228 European Journal of Criminology 15(2)
as well as to privacy and order. Moreover, familiarity and national identity also shaped
subjective experiences of the current confinement. Respondents discussed their
imprisonment in Lithuania in all of these terms yet comparison was a key frame of
reference for understanding their punishment's severity and salience and their ability
to find dignity and respect now back in their country of origin. Thus, penal mobility
can have variable effects on the gap between expectations and actual experiences of
punishment.
We now turn in greater detail to this issue of legitimation and contestation in the
Lithuanian penitentiary system with particular reference to the issue of prison reform. As
discussed previously, the reform to a cell system away from the colony form of punish-
ment is ongoing in Lithuania and there has been a great deal of international influence on
reform processes in the criminal justice sector from the EU, Scandinavian countries and
Canada. Thus, in Lithuania internationalized prisoners meet internationally driven penal
reform projects in their everyday environment. The next section looks at how they make
sense of such projects comparatively.
Comparing and contesting reform
All respondents were aware of the planned reform project to change to a cell system by
2022 and gave opinions on it. Most were sceptical about the possibility that it would
ever be fully implemented. The same concepts of dignity, autonomy, communality,
order, privacy and identity frame discussions about the type of prison that Lithuanian
prisoners expect and the type of reform they find acceptable. Many prisoners who pos-
sess international experience are ambivalent about the reforms, preferring elements of
the familiar Soviet-style culture of punishment, finding some European reforms inap-
propriate for the Lithuanian reality, at the same time as recognizing the potentials ben-
efits of Europeanization.
Respondents reported that the aims of the reforms did not affect their sense of punish-
ment as much as the manner in which reforms were carried out. In particular, piecemeal
attempts to move towards European norms were felt to increase penal impact and suffer-
ing. This related in particular to reforms that reduced autonomy and independence such
as reductions in allowances for personal belongings, spending restrictions in the prison
shop, or the reduction in size of local sectors to reduce the prominence of informal gov-
ernance through the caste system. Once again comparing with conditions in Western
Europe, respondents reported that such reforms were not carried out with the necessary
and corresponding changes to compensate them. Attempts to limit what could be bought
at the prison shop produced a countrywide hunger strike in 2012 involving 80 percent of
the prison population.4 The shop limit was lifted, but there is a constant readiness to fight
other, similar, reforms:
Now they are saying they can ... limit what we can bring into the zona [colony] ourselves. I can
bring 30kg in and they say ­ `what do you need it for?'I'm saying I need it; I need a coat against
the cold because they give you nothing here. And they say they are doing it like in Europe, but
in Europe they give you everything! Blankets and underwear, socks, you don't need anything
there, that's why they can do it ... Then they say: `You buy so much from the shop.'And they
Slade and Vaicinien 229
say `in Europe you can only buy sweets and biscuits at the shop'; well of course because they
provide decent food there.
(Daumantas, Alytus ­ Russia, Germany, Italy, Estonia)
The main theme in the narratives concerning these reforms was concern over a shift
to a dependent position and reliance on prison regimes after the relative autonomy of
the colony system. As the prison administration closed down avenues for self-reliance,
prisoners would be slowly closed in and forced into dependency on the regime. The
pains of imprisonment were being reconfigured by the reform. A clear example con-
cerned visiting rights. Visits in Lithuania are permissive compared with those in other
jurisdictions. Conjugal visits are possible, visiting times are longer and greater freedom
of movement is permitted during visits. One respondent, Antanas (Pravienisks ­
England), compared this situation favourably with the UK, where conjugal visits are not
permitted. Respondents were scathing about any changes to the rights to visits in the
name of European reform. Yet, the reform was already ongoing and there was a sense of
foreboding in many narratives; the reform would only cause greater suffering, conflict
and resistance. Moreover, as one respondent mentioned, such suffering could be justi-
fied by referring to how things are done in Europe:
They don't want to manage us, no ­ they want to slowly put us in cells so they can control each
person, close them in. They want to take away our visits, because they can say that visits don't
happen in Europe. To take it away though, we will riot, hunger strike and so on, in every camp
and prison in Lithuania.
(Jonas, Alytus ­ Germany)
Increased violence and disturbances during prison reform have been recorded in other
post-Soviet cases (Piacentini and Slade, 2015; Slade, 2015). The ability to organize
resistance in such contexts is grounded in the complex forms of informal group govern-
ance that have developed in the open spaces of prison colonies such as those in Lithuania.
Prisoners subordinate themselves to the informal norms and institutions created within
these spaces more readily than they do to the administrative prison regime. As we have
seen, such self-organization can be perceived as either increasing or decreasing the
severity of punishment depending on the individual, creating order for some and insecu-
rity for others. Staff respondents were candid that the cell-system reform in Lithuania, in
part incentivized by high-profile cases of violence censured by the ECHR, was aimed at
reducing informal governance forms by the caste system and gangs. Reforms have
already shrunk the size of local sectors to make them more manageable. Those who pro-
fess strong affiliation with the criminal subculture ­ often referred to as `mafiosi' by
respondents ­ were separated and confined to their own local sector with high walls and
situated far from the other inmates.
These reforms also produced conflicting narratives about respondents' feelings of
being punished. In a context where the penal system provides few opportunities to
improve skills to aid reintegration in society upon release and provisions for resettlement
230 European Journal of Criminology 15(2)
are poor, the social life of the colony is seen by some respondents as a compensatory
mechanism in which prisoners may nurture social skills that are useful upon release.
Again, respondents with international experience expressed frustration that the provi-
sions given to prisoners in other parts of Europe were not available to them at a time
when reform would leave them ever more deprived. Space was a critical matter in this.
The sense of space closing in, local sectors getting smaller and social circles narrowing
also produced feelings that suggested reform was in fact widening the punishment gap.
Some respondents reported that they tried to arrange a move into the most spacious sec-
tors to maintain the communality that they felt was characteristic of the penal colony:
Other local sectors are smaller. We have greenness, grass and it gives you a lot, that. [In other]
sectors ... you go out and all that you can see is the sky and concrete. [We] can get a tan, lie
down on the grass! It makes a difference.
(Vladimir, Alytus ­ Spain)
This was not true for everyone of course, and some who had been in prison abroad had
got used to the privacy and welcomed the move to the cell system on these terms.
I liked being in a one-man cell [in Sweden]; you can be yourself, maybe some people wouldn't
like it, there's less communication. But for me if they open the doors in the morning and close
you in in the evening then in the evening you are dedicated only to yourself.
(Valery, Alytus ­ Belarus and Sweden)
Reform in Lithuania is a contested notion by those in the prison population who have
spent time in prison abroad. Certainly, some prisoners rejected the cell-system reform
completely based on their experience in other countries in Europe. However, most narra-
tives were more complex: internationalized Lithuanian prisoners do not reject the move
to a cell system absolutely, but feel that such reform is skewed towards changes that
increase the pains of imprisonment without any of the ameliorating conditions of Western
European prisons that would make such changes tolerable. Respondents often believed
that notions of `Europeanness' were employed by reformers to justify particular undesir-
able reforms, such as limits on spending in the shop or the allowances on personal
belongings. Referencing a reform as `European', `in line with EU norms'or `to European
standards' uncritically implied that this was shorthand for quality or humaneness.
Conclusion
This article suggests new avenues of enquiry concerning the relationship between glo-
balization and punishment. Firstly, the criminology of mobility assumes that globaliza-
tion is radically altering the interplay of punishment and identity. This article suggests
that this proposition should be examined in cases outside of Western Europe. Our case
study shows that many Lithuanian prisoners have experienced prison abroad and that this
affects individual perceptions of punishment not only in terms of identity. Secondly,
there is a growing literature on the global flows of criminological expertise, policy and
Slade and Vaicinien 231
reform packages but few studies directly link these to their effects on individual subjects.
This article demonstrates that while Lithuanian politicians seek international expertise
and foreign models to reconstruct the physical basis of the Lithuanian penitentiary sys-
tem, internationalized prisoners are able to articulate comparative analyses concerning
what they seek from these reforms in terms of identity, order, privacy, dignity, commu-
nality and autonomy. Thus, there is much more that could be said about the links between
the international dimensions of penal reform and prisoners' internationalized under-
standings of punishment.
As regards such understandings, we have utilized the concept of penal subjectivity
(Sexton, 2012, 2015) for interpreting the narratives of prisoners who have been incarcer-
ated in numerous countries. Sexton's framework emphasizes the impact of comparison,
vicariousness and intersubjective assessments of punishment on penal suffering. Building
on this insight, this article suggests that international experience facilitates comparison,
which in turn informs penal subjectivity and affects the punishment gap by adding an
extra dimension to penal suffering.
Thus, this article makes the case that research that aims to reconceptualize the pains of
imprisonment (Crewe, 2011), measure penal impact (Hayes, 2016) or map penal con-
sciousness (Sexton, 2015) may find internationalization a confounding factor that requires
scholarly attention owing to the increasing numbers of people with experiences of more
than one culture of punishment. Moreover, Pallot et al. (2012) argued that, in the case of
Russia, forcible movement while incarcerated was itself an additional pain of imprison-
ment. Prisoners in Europe will become increasingly mobile as intergovernmental agree-
ments on transfer become active and prisoner consent will not be required. The effects of
this on subjective experiences of punishment should be of interest to criminologists.
Finally, in Lithuania, both policy makers and prisoners perceive the evolution of the
penal system in terms of becoming `European'. The internationalized prisoner body,
however, does not accept this process uncritically. Unfortunately, prisoner voices are
likely to remain relatively unheard. As has been argued elsewhere (Piacentini and Slade,
2015), many penal reform projects in the post-Soviet region have been carried out with-
out any thought to a broader discussion of what prisoners expect from punishment cul-
turally and how certain forms of collectivism might be desirable. Meanwhile, prison
reform advocates in Western European countries argue for less individualizing, more
open and communal prison designs (Hancock and Jewkes, 2011). Thus, while reform
develops along opposite trajectories in different parts of Europe and the notion of
`European penology' becomes disputed, we suggest that, owing to mobility, prisoners
themselves have become better able to assess the merits of these different philosophies
and approaches. The incredible mobility that characterizes modern Europe may well be
shifting understandings of penality from the inside, transforming local cultures of pun-
ishment, providing new bases of contestation ­ especially over reform ­ and filling pris-
ons with comparative criminologists.

Notes
1. Formally penitentiary institutions in Lithuania are called `correctional houses' and contain
almost all of the male prisoner population. There is only one actual jail in Lithuania with a
cell system for remand prisoners and those on life sentences. When we use the term `prison'
in this article we are referring to Lithuanian correctional houses.
