Introduction
Medical students are trained to maintain the health of indi-
vidual patients and of populations. Such training is physi-
cally and mentally demanding and may have undesirable
effects on medical students' personal health (Dyrbye,
Thomas, & Shanafelt, 2005). According to Weil (n.d.), medi-
cal schools foster unhealthy lifestyles; medical students suf-
fer from sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, lack of exercise,
and are placed under a considerable amount of stress. In one
study, medical students were shown to have a poorer status
of physical and mental health, and more anxiety, depression,
and negative lifestyle changes as compared with non-
medical students (Al-Dabal, Koura, Rasheed,Al-Souwielem,
& Makki, 2010). Physicians are health professionals who
play a vital role in a country's health care system. It is there-
fore essential that physicians-in-training maintain their own
well-being to better care for their patients in the future.
Assessing the overall health of individuals and popula-
tions is of public health importance. According to the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (2011), one approach to
this is to make use of an expansive concept known as health-
related quality of life (HRQOL). It is a multidimensional
measure for evaluating physical functioning, psychological
well-being, and social functioning (Calvert & Skelton, 2008).
As it is multifaceted, HRQOL is in agreement with the defi-
nition of health of the World Health Organization (2013),
which is "a state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infir-
mity." HRQOL has been applied to studies of various popu-
lations such as those with chronic diseases or debilitation, as
well as to groups of healthy adults and health professionals.
A search for published research articles that primarily
assessed the HRQOL of medical students revealed studies
conducted in Canada (Raj, Simpson, Hopman, & Singer,
2000), Brazil (Paro et al., 2010), and Iran (Jamali et al.,
2013), and none in the Philippines. This study therefore
aimed to assess the HRQOL of medical students at the Saint
Louis University in Baguio City, Philippines. Specifically, it
sought to determine the status of the HRQOL of the medical
students along the domains of physical functioning, role lim-
itations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health
perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due
to emotional problems, and mental health; it also sought to

Health-Related Quality of Life of Future
Physicians at a Medical School in the
Philippines: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract
Medical students are trained to maintain the health of patients, but such training may have undesirable effects on medical
students' personal health. This study therefore aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of medical
students and to determine the factors that are associated with the students' HRQOL. The target population included all
students enrolled at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Baguio City, Philippines, during school year 2012-2013.
The measurements included the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for HRQOL, Beck Depression
Inventory, abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, and self-report
items for other exposure variables. A total of 527 medical students participated in the study. The mean scores in all of the
eight domains of HRQOL ranged from 51.36 to 85.83. The highest mean scores were along the areas of physical functioning
(85.83) and bodily pain (69.20), whereas the lowest mean scores were in the areas of vitality (51.72) and role limitations due
to emotional problems (51.36). Depression, stress, and burnout were associated with lower scores in most of the domains
of HRQOL. Medical students in our school are generally in a satisfactory state of functional health and well-being, but have
a lower level of mental health as compared with physical health.

determine factors associated with the medical students'
HRQOL.
Method
Study Design
A cross-sectional study design was used. In this design, the
outcome variable, which is the HRQOL, as well as the expo-
sure variables were assessed at a particular point in time
using a questionnaire. A descriptive cross-sectional design
was used to determine the status of the medical students'
HRQOL. An analytical cross-sectional design was used to
determine the factors that are associated with the medical
students' HRQOL.
Study Population
The target population included all students enrolled at the
Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Baguio City,
Philippines, during school year 2012-2013. The total popula-
tion of the students was 608. As all students were included in
the study, no sampling techniques were employed.
Data Collection
Data were gathered using a questionnaire consisting of the
following parts:
Assessment of HRQOL.HRQOL was measured using the
36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.
The SF-36 is a multipurpose, short-form health survey con-
sisting of 36 questions. It measures eight areas of health:
physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health,
bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social func-
tioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and
mental health. The tool produces scores for each of these
eight areas. As a generic measure, this questionnaire has
been useful in evaluating the health of general and specific
populations as well as assessing HRQOL (Ware, 2003).
Thus, it is an appropriate data gathering instrument for this
study.
The SF-36 was authored by John E. Ware Jr. and was
developed as a part of the RAND Medical Outcomes Study
(MOS): Measures of Quality of Life Core Survey (RAND
Corporation, n.d.-a). The utilization of the SF-36 has been
cited in more than 4,000 published articles. It has also been
acknowledged as the most widely evaluated generic patient
assessed health outcome among quality of life measures. It
has also been used in the description of more than 200 dis-
eases and conditions. Translations of the instrument have
been documented in 22 countries (Ware, 2003). The SF-36
has been reported to have high reliability, with coefficients
exceeding .70 and even .80. There is also evidence of the
instrument having adequate content validity, concurrent
validity, criterion validity, construct validity, and predictive
validity. The various studies on the validity of the SF-36 are
cited elsewhere (Ware, 2003). A recent study has shown that
the instrument is a valid and reliable tool for measuring the
health status among Filipinos residing in two cities in the
Philippines (Castillo-Carandang et al., 2013).
The SF-36 can be used as a self-administered question-
naire, or can be administered via a computer or personal or
telephone interview. It takes only 5 to 10 minutes to com-
plete. In this study, it was given to the medical students as a
self-administered questionnaire.
Scoring of the instrument followed the two-step process
as recommended by the RAND Corporation (n.d.-b). In the
first step, precoded numeric values were recoded using a
scoring key. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 100. The
scores represented the percentage of the total possible score
achieved. In the second step, items in the same scale were
averaged together to yield the eight-area (scale) scores.
Missing data were not included when computing for the
scale scores.
In this study, norm-based interpretation of the SF-36 was
used. In this interpretation strategy, 50 is considered as the
average score or norm. Scores higher than 50 are better than
the general population average for all the eight scales,
whereas scores lower than 50 are worse (Gandek, 2002).
Assessment of depression. Depression was assessed using the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). This instrument was orig-
inally meant to measure depression in patients with mental
illness, but it can also be used in a primary care setting. It
consists of 21 questions, each question having four possible
responses with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The total score of
the test is a measure of the severity of depression. In a pri-
mary care setting, a score higher than 21 is interpreted as
having depression. Studies have provided evidence of the
validity of this tool; it is also considered to have high reli-
ability (Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders, n.d.).
The BDI has been validated in some Asian countries such
as Indonesia (Ginting, Näring, van der Veld, Srisayekti, &
Becker, 2013), Korea (Yu, Lee, & Lee, 2011), and Japan
(Kojima, Furukawa, Takahashi, Kawai, & Nagaya, 2002).
However, a review of the literature did not reveal any valida-
tion studies of the BDI done in the Philippines.
Measurement of burnout. To measure burnout, an abbreviated
Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) was used. This inven-
tory is the most widely used measure of burnout (Maslach,
Jackson, Leiter, Schaufeli, & Schwab, n.d.). The abbreviated
form contains only 12 out of the original 22 questions, but
still assesses the same three domains, namely, emotional
exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment
(McManus, Smithers, Partridge, Keeling, & Fleming, 2003).
The abbreviated form includes an additional three items
regarding "satisfaction with medicine," which makes it an
appropriate tool for the present study of medical students. No
Domantay 3
validation studies of the aMBI or the Maslach Burnout
Inventory in the Philippines were found.
Measurement of perceived stress. Stress was measured using
the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This is the most commonly
employed questionnaire to gauge an individual's perception
of stress (Cohen, n.d.). It consists of 14 items which are eas-
ily understood and hence can be used in the general popula-
tion. It has been validated in studies, particularly those
dealing with health status. For example, in Asia, it has been
validated among Chinese cardiac patients who are smokers
(Leung, Lam, & Chan, 2010). It also has good reliability
(Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983).
Measurement of stressful life events. Stressful life events were
assessed using the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale (Mind-
Tools, n.d.). This is a list of 43 stressful life events that have
been correlated with illness. Each stressful event corresponds
to a value known as a life change unit (LCU), depending on
how stressful the event is. The sum of the LCUs yields an
estimate of an individual's stress level and likelihood of ill-
ness. For this particular study, life events that were most
likely to apply to medical students in the Philippine setting
were included in the questionnaire. For example, divorce
was not included as divorce is not allowed in the Philippines.
However, no formal validation of this instrument has been
conducted in the Philippines.
Measurement of other variables.The instrument also con-
tained self-report items related to the other exposure vari-
ables. These variables were age, sex, civil status, year level,
academic performance, pre-medical course, and socioeco-
nomic status.
Data Management
The questionnaires were administered personally by the
researcher accompanied by a research assistant. The ques-
tionnaires were administered at the middle of the second
semester. Questionnaires were administered during regular
class days and not during major examination periods.
To extract the data from the questionnaires, the responses
were coded, using number codes to make the data suitable
for analysis.
Microsoft Excel was used for data entry. Only one data-
base was created. The database had one variable for each
item in the questionnaire and one record for each respondent.
Each participant had a unique identifier in the form of an
identification number. The Microsoft Excel file was then
exported to Epi Info 7 for data analysis.
Data Analysis
The main outcome variable was the HRQOLscores (continuous
quantitative). Exposure variables included age (quantitative),
sex (binary), civil status (unordered categorical), ethnicity
(unordered categorical), year level (ordered categorical), aca-
demic performance (ordered categorical), pre-medical course
(unordered categorical), socioeconomic status (ordered categor-
ical), depression (continuous quantitative), burnout (continuous
quantitative), stress levels (continuous quantitative), and stress-
ful life events (continuous quantitative).
Prior to actual analysis, the data were checked for missing
values. These were appropriately coded, so that the computer
will recognize them as missing and thus exclude them from
the analysis.
In the analysis of the data, the following were carried out:
basic descriptive analysis in the form of means and standard
deviations of the HRQOL scores along the eight scales; mea-
sures of association between the HRQOL scores and the
exposure variables, t test, and null hypotheses and p values
for the association between the HRQOL scores and binary
variables, that is, sex, one-way ANOVA and null hypotheses,
and p values for the association between the HRQOL scores
and unordered and ordered categorical variables. In addition,
Bartlett's test for inequality of population variances was per-
formed. If the p value from Bartlett's test was less than .05,
non-parametric tests such as the Mann­Whitney/Wilcoxon
two-sample test or the Kruskal­Wallis test were used instead
of the t test or ANOVA, respectively. Pearson's correlation
coefficient and null hypotheses and p values were used to
determine the association between the HRQOL scores and
quantitative variables, that is, age, depression (BDI score),
burnout (aMBI score), stress levels (PSS Score), and stress-
ful life events (Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale score).
Ethical Considerations
The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the university prior to
the conduct of the study. The review considered both scien-
tific and ethical aspects of the research. The questionnaire
had a cover letter that provided information on the research
objectives as well as the significance and importance of the
study. Participation in the study was voluntary and it was
explained to the students that they had the option not to
answer the questionnaire. Students were not compensated for
their participation. Complete anonymity of the research par-
ticipants was observed as the participants were asked not to
write their names or any identifying marks on the question-
naires. Thus, specific information on the questionnaires
could not be linked to specific individuals. Access to the data
was limited only to the researcher and two research
assistants.

(61.1%) and single (96.77%). The highest percentage of
respondents were in first year (30.4%). In terms of academic
performance, the most common grade point average range
was 80 to 84. Most of the medical students studied nursing as
their pre-medical coursework (55.6%). The most common
combined annual income range was between PhP (Philippine
pesos) 100,000 and PhP 499,999 (40.5%; Table 1).
The response rate in this study was 86.7%. Among the
non-responders, there was an almost equal number of males
and females; 40 were males and 41 were females, with a
male to female ratio of approximately 1:1. The male to
female ratio in each year of the medical school was as fol-
lows: first year--1:1.4, second year--1:1.4, third year--
1:1.6, and fourth year--1:1.5. The overall male to female
ratio in the medical school is 1:1.5. Further analysis revealed
that there was no significant difference between the non-
responders and responders according to sex (p = .10; see
Table A1 in the appendix). Although it is possible that some
students who refused to participate were symptomatic, for
example, with depression, the high response rate makes non-
response bias less likely.
In all, 45 students (8.5%) had manifestations of clinical
depression, whereas 182 students (34.5%) had features of
moderate to major stress. The medical students had a low
tendency for burnout along the domains of personal accom-
plishment and depersonalization, but had a high tendency for
burnout along the domain of emotional exhaustion. They
scored relatively high in terms of satisfaction with medicine
(Table 2).
HRQOL of the Medical Students
The mean scores in all of the eight domains were above 50,
ranging from 51.36 to 85.83. The highest mean scores were
along the areas of physical functioning (85.83) and bodily
pain (69.20), whereas the lowest mean scores were in the
areas of vitality (51.72) and role limitations due to emotional
problems (51.36; Table 3).
Associations Between HRQOL and the Exposure
Variables
Male students tended to have higher scores than female stu-
dents along the domains of general health (p = .001), vitality
(p = .014), and role limitations due to emotional problems
(p = .004). There were no significant differences in the
HRQOL scores among the four year levels except for the
area of social functioning, where fourth-year students had
lower scores as compared with the other three year levels (p
< .001). There were also no associations between the HRQOL
scores and academic performance, except in the domain of

role limitations due to physical health where those with
lower weighted averages had lower HRQOL scores than
those with higher weighted averages (p = .015; Table 4).
In the Philippines, students admitted to a medical school
should be holders of a baccalaureate degree, which is termed
as their pre-medical course. Those who studied nursing as
their pre-medical course had higher scores in the area of
bodily pain (p = .046), whereas those who studied medical
technology as their pre-medical course had higher scores in
the area of social functioning (p = .008). No associations
were observed between the HRQOL scores and age, civil sta-
tus, and parents' combined annual income (Table 4).
There was a striking association observed between the
HRQOL scores and depression; those who were depressed
had significantly lower scores in seven out of the eight
domains, as compared with those without depression (p <
.001). In terms of stress, those with moderate to major stress
had lower scores in the areas of role limitations due to physi-
cal health, general health, and role limitations due to emo-
tional problems (Table 4). Similar findings were observed in
terms of perceived stress, presented in Table 5, where nega-
tive correlation coefficients in all areas of HRQOL except
bodily pain and social functioning, indicated that higher
stress levels were related to lower HRQOL scores.
As for burnout, emotional exhaustion and depersonaliza-
tion were negatively correlated with HRQOL scores in six
out of the eight areas. The relationships were stronger for
emotional exhaustion as compared with depersonalization.
There were slightly positive correlations between satisfac-
tion with medicine and HRQOL in five out of the eight areas
(Table 5).
Discussion
The results of this study showed that overall, medical stu-
dents had an average to above average HRQOL. It also
revealed that students had a higher HRQOL in the scales
related to physical health, that is, physical functioning and
bodily pain, but scored lower in scales related to mental
health, that is, vitality and role limitations due to emotional
problems. Depression, stress, and burnout were associated
with lower scores in most of the domains of HRQOL,
whereas sex, pre-medical course, academic performance,
and year level were associated with fewer of the HRQOL
domains.
The lowest scores were in those domains related to mental
health. This means that medical students have a tendency to
encounter problems with work or other daily activities as a
result of emotional problems and that they may experience
feelings of nervousness and depression (Ware, 2003). These
are likely related to the nature of the medical school experi-
ence, which has been often described as stressful. Medical
students have to undergo frequent periods of adjustment,
which may affect them emotionally. For instance, first-year
students have to adjust to medical school itself, which is
more rigorous and intellectually challenging as compared
with their pre-medical course. Students in third year have to
adjust to clinically oriented courses, from the basic science
courses of lower years, not to mention the issue of academic
overload typical of third year. Students in fourth year have to
adjust to clinical clerkship, wherein full-time clinical train-
ing in the hospital is an entirely different experience from
teaching and learning in the classroom setting. Moreover,
this study also showed that psychological conditions such as
depression, stress, and burnout are inversely related to
HRQOL scores.
There are other issues that might stress medical students.
Although family members are generally supportive, due to
the cultural norm of close family ties in the Philippines, they
can also be a source of stress, especially for students who
have family problems, or who are married and/or with chil-
dren, who may be struggling to balance family life and medi-
cal school training. Financial problems can also be a source
of stress, as medical education is expensive and scholarship
grants for medical education are very limited in the
Philippines.
The findings of the current study are consistent with those
of Voltmer, Rosta, Aasland, and Spahn (2010) who, as a part
of their article, studied the HRQOL of medical students in
Germany and discovered that the students had lower scores
in the domain of mental health as compared with physical
health. The results are also in agreement with those of Dyrbye
et al. (2007) who, also as a part of their article, determined
the quality of life of medical students in the United States.
Their students also had relatively low mental quality of life
scores.
However, medical students are able to perform all types of
physical activities, even the most vigorous, without limita-
tions due to health, and that they do not experience pain or
there are no limitations due to pain (Ware, 2003). A possible
explanation for this might be that the great majority of medi-
cal students are apparently physically fit young adults, as
attested by their annual medical-physical examinations.
Students have to undergo these physical examinations

together with basic laboratory tests prior to enrollment.
Moreover, chronic diseases which may bring about pain and
physical limitations are uncommon in this age group.
Our study also showed that males had significantly higher
scores than females in the domains of general health and
vitality. This means that males have a tendency to evaluate
their personal health as excellent and that they always feel
energetic, as compared with females. This is in keeping with
the cultural norm in the Philippines where men are generally
considered to be the stronger sex, thus men perceive them-
selves to be so. The present study also revealed that male
medical students had significantly higher scores in the
domain of role limitations due to emotional problems as
compared with female medical students. A higher score
means that there are less interferences with work or daily
activities as a result of emotional problems. This is again
consistent with the cultural norm in the Philippines where
men are supposed to be less emotional than women. Thus,
male medical students in general do not let emotions or emo-
tional problems hinder their performance in their studies and
training. These findings are similar to those of the study of
Paro et al. (2010) that female students had lower HRQOL
scores than males. Jamali et al. (2013) also established that
male gender was significantly associated with higher
HRQOL scores as compared with females.
Regarding the factors associated with HRQOL, our find-
ings are similar to those of Paro et al. (2010) who found out
that female medical students and those with depression had
lower HRQOL scores. Dyrbye et al. (2007) likewise reported
that burnout and depression were major factors that influ-
enced medical students' quality of life. In addition, Swami et
al. (2007) observed that in Malaysia, life satisfaction, which
is used interchangeably with quality of life, was inversely
related to depression. Arslan, Ayranci, Unsal, and Arslantas

Note. No associations were observed between the HRQOL scores and age, civil status, and parents' combined annual income. HRQOL = health-related
quality of life; PF = physical functioning; RP = role-physical; BP = bodily pain; GH = general health; VT = vitality; SF = social functioning; RE = role-
emotional; MH = mental health; ns = not significant; BDI = Beck Depression Inventory.

(2009) also reported that in Turkey, the scores of the SF-36
scale were lower for those with depression as compared with
those without depression.
However, the results of the current study differ from those
of Naseem and Iqbal's (2010) study. Among Pakistani medi-
cal students, physical functioning, general health perception,
vitality, and social functioning for second-year students were
significantly less than the other classes. In the present study,
social functioning was highest among third-year students
and lowest among fourth-year students. This is because stu-
dents in the third year have already adjusted to life in medical
school and have already established friendships among
classmates. Thus, they are able to interact with each other
and socialize on weekends. However, fourth-year students
are in clinical clerkship wherein they spend most of their
time in the hospital. There is little time for socialization with
friends and after work they would rather rest and sleep in
preparation for the next hospital duty the following day. This
is similar to the findings of Paro et al. (2010) and Jamali et al.
(2013) where students in the highest year level had lower
HRQOL scores as compared with lower year levels.
It is interesting to note that 45 medical students (8.5%)
had depression based on the BDI score. Further analysis of
Item Number 9 on the BDI, which assesses suicidal thoughts,
revealed that 54 students checked the response "I have
thoughts of killing myself, but I would not carry them out";
3 students responded that "I would like to kill myself"; and 2
students responded that "I would kill myself if I had the
chance." This has implications for counseling services in a
medical school. Such services are available at our universi-
ty's Guidance Center, and the head of the center personally
attends to medical students who seek consultation. However,
very few medical students avail of these services, most prob-
ably due to lack of time owing to their heavy class schedule
and busy hospital rotations.
The strength of this study is that it made use of well-
established and validated data gathering instruments such as
the SF-36, BDI, aMBI, PSS, and Holmes and Rahe Stress
Scale. The use of such tools minimized information bias.
This study also had a relatively high response rate, which
could have minimized selection bias. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study on the HRQOL of medical
students in the Philippines.
However, this study also had certain limitations. As in
other studies employing questionnaires, recall bias is a pos-
sibility. In determining the factors associated with HRQOL,
confounding was not assessed as the main objective of the
study was to describe the status of the medical students'
HRQOL. Furthermore, the present study only involved stu-
dents from just one medical school in the Philippines. This
limits the study's generalizability. The results may not neces-
sarily be extrapolated to students from other medical schools
in the country or to those from other countries. It is important
to bear in mind that medical schools vary in terms of the
nature of their curricula, for instance, traditional versus prob-
lem-based learning, duration of the medical course, as well
as school and hospital atmosphere and environment. Medical
students from different schools may also vary according to
sociodemographic characteristics such as age and sex distri-
bution, and other personality characteristics. All these may
influence their HRQOL.
In conclusion, medical students in our school are gener-
ally in a satisfactory state of functional health and well-
being, but have a lower level of mental health as compared
with physical health. Depression, stress, and burnout reduce
the medical students' state of health. The results of this study
have implications for medical educators in our school. It
could provide a basis for the development of student well-
ness programs and activities. It is imperative that counseling
services and mentoring programs for medical students be
strengthened and enhanced. Improving the well-being of
future physicians will hopefully translate to better quality of
care for the patients they are meant to serve.
Future research on the HRQOL of medical students is
needed. This study may be replicated by other medical schools
in the country. Further investigations could utilize a longitudi-
nal design rather than a cross-sectional design to trace changes
in the students'health and well-being over time.
