Abstract
This paper utilizes data from the 2002 Chinese Household Income Project to estimate
the labor market return to graduating from college relative to high school. Parameter
estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects reveal that for minorities, the average
treatment effect of earning a baccalaureate degree from colleges/universities ranked
good and very good is high relative to the Han majority, and for those actually
receiving the treatment from colleges/universities ranked good. Our findings suggest
that the mismatch hypothesis cannot be viewed as a universal phenomenon that
renders affirmative action in college/university admissions an ineffective policy tool to
redress/remedy historic discrimination against minority groups.

Background
Much discussion concerning the efficacy of affirmative action in college and university
admissions focuses on the United States. This paper offers a unique perspective by
examining the effects of affirmative action on ethnic minority earnings in China. There
are 55 ethnic minority groups in China that constitute approximately 9% of the popu-
lation. Despite post-1978 reform efforts to modernize the economy, most evidence
suggests that ethnic minorities lag behind the Han majority in educational attainment
(Myers et al. 2013). In her consideration of how educational attainment in China is
stratified by ethnicity, Hannum (2002) indicates that one reason why an ethnic minor-
ity relative to Han majority educational attainment disparity exists may be due to eth-
nic minority groups perceiving that the tangible returns to education may be low. Of
course, to the extent that there is ethnic minority discrimination in China's labor mar-
ket (Johnson and Chow 1997; Li 2003; Zang 2008) that lowers the return to investment
in human capital, then relative to the Han majority, members of China's 55 officially
recognized ethnic groups would have an incentive to invest less in human capital. To

redress these educational disparities, China initiated deliberate affirmative action pol-
icies designed to reduce ethnic economic inequality (Mishra and Smyth 2010; Zang
2008). Some argue, however, that these policies have the unintended effect of reducing
optimal investment in human capital and thus thwart efforts to reduce Han-Minority
disparities in education and earnings. This is similar to arguments often made for the
poor educational outcomes for African Americans in the face of affirmative action in
the United States (Fryer et al. 2005).
The challenge to understanding how or whether affirmative action retards or en-
hances ethnic disparities in China is that relative disadvantange or ethnic minorities
manifests itself in multiple forms. There are disadvantages in education completion
(Hannum 2002; Rong and Shi 2001; Wu 2010), health (Elu and Price 2013), the labor
market (Becquelin 2000; Hannum and Xie 1998; Li and Ding 2013; Maurer-Fazio et al.
2010; Jijiao and Peng 2013; Yee 2003; Zang 2008), the incidence of poverty (Gustafsson
and Ding 2009a), and in living standards (Gustafsson and Ding 2009b). With respect to
labor market earnings, Johnson and Chow (1997), Li (2003), and Xiaowei and Lulu
(2001) find evidence of minority-Han majority differentials that is suggestive of dis-
crimination against minorities in the post-reform era.
Another challenge to understanding the effects of affirmative action in China is that
quality of institutions vary substantially from one province to another. Most of the top
universities in China are located in Beijing and Shanghai, the largest cities in the na-
tion.1 But, regional universities as well as Minzu (minority) Universities are often the
destination for students with lower test scores. Thus, there is a sorting mechanism pro-
duced by affirmative action in a nation where there is a single criterion for admission
to college: the national test score.2 The primary route for implementation of affirmative
action in higher education in China is via additional points awarded to ethnic minority
group members on their Gao Kao scores.3
Gao Kao (The National College Entrance Examination) is organized by the Ministry
of Education of the People's Republic of China. Beijing, Shanghai and the other thirteen
provinces, howver, use their own examination questions.4 The Gao Kao scores are al-
most the only evidence universities use to matriculate students. The Chinese govern-
ment ranks colleges and universities and have identified the "top" or very good
instituions as well as the next tier of (or good) institutions both for receipt of funding
and for national recognition. These top insittuions are identified as "985" program and
"211" program universities.5 The admissions standards at these top program univer-
sities nationwide always are higher than the admissions for other, often regional
instituions. For example, Beijing University ­ sometimes called the Harvard of China ­
designated the minimum admission score for science students from Yunnan Province
in 2015 to be 699 out of a total score of 750. Yunnan Province is located in the heavily
minority area of southwest China and has both a minority university (Yunnan Minzu
University, formerly Yunnan University for Nationalities) and a conventional although
not highly ranked regional institution, Yunnan University. The designated minimum
admission scores for science students from Yunnan in 2015 was only 530 at Yunnan
University and 489 at Yunnan Minzu University.6
Officially recognized members of ethnic minority groups can receive from five to up
to 50 extra points on their Gao Kao scores. The extra points awarwded vary from prov-
ince to province and not every province awards points for all 55 ethnic minority

groups. For example, Inner Mongolia ­ an ethnic minority autonomous region domi-
nated by the ethnic minority group, Mongolians ­ only awards extra points to Mongo-
lian, Daur, Oroqen, Evenki and Russ students. Other minority students are not eligible
for the additional points.
In short, China has a very explicit form of affirmative action that acts as a point sys-
tem similar to the price premia and point systems often struck down as unconstitu-
tional in the United States. Embedded in the system is the potential for alleged
"mismatch" since minority students with say 650 initial scores might matriculate at top
universities where they are in the lower tier of their peers or they might matriculate at
regional universitis where they would be at the very top of their classes. In this sense,
then, China is a good test for the mismatch hypothesis as well as the view that affirma-
tive action reduces investment in human capital and reduces relative earnings of
minorities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II the data and empir-
ical methodology are discussed. Our econometric strategy for identifying the relative
minority to Han majority returns to 4 years of college views the receipt of a baccalaur-
eate degree as a heterogeneous treatment with selection. In particular we view being a
minority with a baccalaureate degree in China as a source of heterogeneous outcomes
in the labor market. We report parameter estimates in section III, and the last section
concludes.
Methods
As in Heckman and Li (2004), we consider a potential outcomes specification of a
Mincerian earnings equation of the form lnYi
= i
Si
+ Xi
+ Ui
, where Yi
is a measure
of earnings, Si
= 1 for individuals with a baccalaureate degree and Si
= 0 if an individual
is a high school graduate, i
is the heterogeneous return to education, Xi
is a vector of
conditioning variables with effects given by the vector , and Ui
is an error term. Given
the two potential outcomes lnYi
= Si
lnY1i
+ (1 - Si
)lnY0i
, Ui
= Si
U1i
+ (1 - Si
)U0i
, and
individuals select going to college or not according to SÃ
i
= f(Z), Si
= 1 if SÃ
i
 0, where
SÃ
i
is a latent variable capturing the net benefit of an individual earning a baccalaureate
degree, and Z is a vector of variables that determine SÃ
i
.
Given the treatment Si
, three treatment effects can be defined and estimated: 1.) The
Average Treatment Effect (ATE), 2.) The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated
(ATET), and 3.) The Average Treatment Effect on the Non-Treated (ATENT). For Si
= 1,
ATE measures the treatment effect for a randomly selected member of the population
and ATET measures the treatment effect for those who actually received the treatment.
ATENT measures the treatment effect on those who did not receive the treatment had
they in fact received the treatment.7 If there is selection into treatment and treatment ef-
fects are heterogeneous such that individual characteristics in Xi
condition outcomes,
then in general ATE  ATE(Xi
), ATET  ATET(Xi
) and ATENT  ATENT(Xi
).8
The treatment effect of interest in this paper measures the causal effect of an individ-
ual's decision to earn a baccalaureate degree within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM)
framework (Holland 1986). In the RCM framework, a treatment effect is defined for
each individual in terms of two potential outcomes. Each individual has one outcome
that would manifest if exposed to the treatment of earning a baccalaureate degree from
Ding et al. International Journal of Anthropology and Ethnology (2017) 1:3 Page 3 of 13
a Chinese college/university of a given quality, and another outcome if were exposed to
the control of not having earned a baccalaureate degree at all. The treatment effect is
the difference between these two potential outcomes. Given evidence of heterogeneity
in the returns to education in Asia (Tsai and Xie 2011), our heterogeneous treatment
effect estimates enable better identification of the returns to education when there is
selection on both observables and unobservables that are specific to ethnicity. In this
context, our estimates of the relevant treatment effect constitutes an evaluation of edu-
cational policies in China that aim to enhance college/university access for minorities,
as well as informing the labor market rate of return on an earned baccalaureate degree
conditional upon the quality of the college/university.
We utilize data from the 2002 CHIPS (Li 2002). In particular, we use the Urban
Individual Income, Consumption and Employment Data, as it enables estimation of
earnings equations in the large Chinese urban labor market.9 The 2002 CHIPS was
designed and implemented to measure and estimate the distribution of personal
income and related economic factors in both rural and urban areas of the People's
Republic of China. The measures of earnings are based on cash payments and on a
broad range of additional components. The Urban Individual Income, Consumption
and Employment Data provides standard demographic variables such as the individual's
ethnicity, as well as economic variables such as medical insurance and expenditures,
economically productive social contacts, and employment information including occu-
pation, sector, income, hours, conditions, job history, and training. All data were
collected through a series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and
urban areas at the end of 2002.
While there are several waves of CHIPS, which would enable larger estimation sam-
ples, we constrain our analysis to the 2002 CHIPS as it permits an identification strat-
egy not possible otherwise.10 Given that individual schooling choices are potentially
correlated with unobservables, unbiased parameter estimation with selection on unob-
servables requires an instrument and exclusion restriction on a covariate that is uncor-
related with individual unobservables. The 2002 CHIPS contains a covariate, not
present in other sample years of CHIPS, that enables identification in the presence of
selection on unobservables. In particular, the 2002 CHIPS identifies whether or not an
individual respondent was an "intellectual youth" meaning the respondent moved to
the rural areas during the Cultural Revolution.
Our interest in the intellectual youth variable stems from its utility as in input into a
sensible identification strategy. Li and Zax (2003) suggest that Chinese workers who
were rusticated in their youth and sent to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution
suffered in both the quality and the quantity of their education. As our inquiry explores
the effects of minority group status on both the returns and returns by quality of a bac-
calaureate degree, that being an intellectual youth can condition schooling decisions
enables identification of baccalaureate degree treatment effects.. To the extent that
moving to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution is plausibly unrelated to labor
supply preferences as Li and Zax (2003) posit, it is likely to be uncorrelated with unob-
servables such as ability that is related to individual schooling investment decisions. As
such, having been an intellectual youth can serve as an exclusion restriction for identi-
fying the returns to schooling when there are both observables and unobservables that
govern selection into college.

Our strategy to determine if the returns to a baccalaureate degree are different
between minorities and the Han majority is to determine if ethnicity is a source
of heterogeneity in the labor market returns to a baccalaureate degree. The same
strategy is adopted for the returns to a baccalaureate degree given the quality of
the college/university from which the degree was earned. We specify and estimate
a Mincerian earnings equation where Yi
= annual earnings, and the elements of Xi
include, years of labor market experience, a binary indicator for being male, a bin-
ary indicator for being a member of the communist party, a binary indicator for
being employed in the manufacturing sector, a binary indicator for being
employed in a state-owned enterprise.11 To control for earnings differences due to
ethnic minority educational stratification by geography (Hannum and Meiyan
2006), we also include binary controls for the 11 different provinces respondents
reported in the 2002 CHIPS. We consider three treatments (Si
): Graduated from
college, Graduated from a college ranked very good, and Graduated from a college
ranked good. All covariates are derived from relevant questions from the Urban
Individual Income, Consumption and Employment Data in the 2002 CHIPS, for
which a summary is reported in Table 1.

Results and Discussion
Table 2 reports the relevant treatment effects. High School graduates are the control
group. The results in the first column assume no selection into a homogeneous treat-
ment and are based on an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) specification of lnYi
. The sec-
ond column assumes selection into a homogeneous treatment. The last three columns
assume selection into a heterogeneous treatment, where the heterogeneity is condi-
tioned on whether on not an individual is a member of ethnic group.12 Given that the
ATE is no longer a singleton when there is heterogeneity and selection in treatment
outcomes, we report the ATE, ATET and ATENT when conditioning on an individual's
minority status. With the exception of the treatment parameter estimates with hetero-
geneity conditioned on minority status reported in the last three columns, the specifi-
cations are estimated with the person-level weights.
As the decision to attend college is potentially correlated with unobservables, we in-
strument our measure of college graduation with a binary variable indicating whether
or not the respondent was an "intellectual youth" meaning the respondent moved to
the rural areas during the Cultural Revolution. In particular, we use the intellectual
youth binary variable as an exclusion restriction in a Heckit two-step estimator of treat-
ment effects.13 We use a bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani 1993) with 100 replications in
all the Heckit IV heterogeneous treatment specifications to estimate the standard errors
for the treatment effects.14

Given our interest in the treatment effect of having a college degree in China and
how it may vary according to minority group status, for sake of economy and brevity in
the exposition of results, the parameter estimates in Table 2 omit the estimated signs
on the control covariates summarized in Table 1, in addition to the estimated parame-
ters of the relevant selection into the relevant treatment specification. Beijing was ex-
cluded from the provincial dummies, enabling the 10 remaining provinces to identify
the wage/earnings effects of being in a particular province relative to Beijing. We do re-
port the estimated parameter for the minority indicator variable, and where relevant,
the estimated parameter on the selection correction term . In total, the results in
Table 2 follow from the estimated parameters of 15 regression, all of which except for
the OLS results in the first column include a first-stage IV regression which being an
intellectual youth is the instrument in the selection into treatment regression­which is
excluded from the specification determining earnings.
The simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) ATE results in the first column suggest
that for both ethnic minorities and the Han-majority, the labor market returns to a bac-
calaureate degree are substantial, and increase with the quality of the college/university
granting the degree. As the return is relative to high school, the annual return is the es-
timated treatment effect--which is the change in annual earnings divided by the as-
sumed 4 years spent earning a baccalaureate degree. The annual return for just having
a baccalaureate degree is approximately 10.6%, and this increases to approximately
11.3% and for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respect-
ively. These estimates are approximately similar to those reported by Heckman and Li
(2004), and provide further evidence of the hight returns to education in post-reform
era Chinese labor markets.
Given selection into treatment, the ATE results in the second column reveal that for
graduating from a college with a ranking of very good, the labor market returns to a
baccalaureate degree are higher than estimated by simple OLS--which suggests that
simple OLS estimates can be downwardly biased.15 The annual return for just having a
baccalaureate degree is approximately 8%, and this increases to approximately 17.8 and
11.4% for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respectively.
The pattern of the selection-adjusted ATE estimate is similar to the OLS estimate, as
the labor market return to a baccalaureate degree is increasing in the quality of the col-
lege/university from which the degree was earned.
The last three columns report selection-adjusted treatment effects allowing the labor
market return for a baccalaureate degree to be conditioned on minority status. In par-
ticular, these parameter estimates allow for heterogeneity in the returns to a baccalaur-
eate degree by allowing individuals a unique return that is a function of whether or not
they are a minority. The ATE estimates reveal that for ethnic minorities, the labor mar-
ket returns to a baccalaureate degree are lower, as for all three treatments, relative to
the ATE estimates under homogeneity, minority status is associated with a higher ATE.
For ethnic minorities, the annual return for just having a baccalaureate degree is ap-
proximately 9.9% for minorities. However this increases to approximately 20.1 and
13.3% for graduating from a college/university ranked very good and good respectively.
For Chinese minorities actually receiving the treatment, the ATET results in column 4
are only significantly different from zero, in the case of a college/university ranked
good. This suggests that relative to the Han majority that received the treatments, the
Ding et al. International Journal of Anthropology and Ethnology (2017) 1:3 Page 7 of 13
returns to a baccalaureate degree are higher for minorities who graduate from a col-
lege/university ranked good.
As ATE = ATET × Prob(S = 1) + ATENT × Prob(S = 0), that the ATET is only signifi-
cantly different from zero in the case of graduating from a college ranked good for all
three treatments when conditioning on minority status provides insight into why rela-
tive to the Han majority, the ATET is no different in the case of graduating from col-
lege and graduating from a college ranked very good. The ATENT, which is not
statistically significant for minorities for all three measures of earning a baccalaureate
degree, is the labor market return the control group--minority high school gradua-
tes--would realize had they earned a baccalaureate degree. This suggests that one rea-
son why the ATET conditioned on minority status is insignificant is not significant for
all three measures is that colleges/universities have not fully exploited a pipeline of mi-
nority students who could earn and benefit from a baccalaureate degree. Indeed, to the
extent that the ATENT is an increasing function of the number of high school gradu-
ates, the zero ATETs associated with earning a baccalaureate degree in general, and
from a college/university ranked very good in particular for minorities could reflect a
constrained supply of minority high school graduates that feed into China's colleges/
universities overall.
The estimated sign on the selection terms is never significant for the parameter esti-
mates in columns 2 - 5. This suggests that in general, the treatment of attending college
is not endogenous, even when the returns are heterogeneous across ethnic groups in
China. As the results do show that the returns are conditioned on minority status, one
implication is that even if attending college is not endogenous, and correlated with in-
dividual unobservables, failure to control for heterogeneity due to minority group sta-
tus could lead to biased estimates of the return to college in China as the OLS results
in column 1 suggest.
The minority group status indicator is also never significant in the earnings equation.
This suggests that being an ethnic minority is not a source of wage/earnings discrimin-
ation in China's urban labor markets. This runs counter to evidence of discrimination
against urban minorities in China found by Ding et al. (2012) based on separate earn-
ings specifications by gender. However, as the minority-specific treatment effects of
having a college degree are always positive and significant, this suggests that minorities
in China possibly offset wage/earnings discrimination through high educational invest-
ment relative to the Han majority (Wu 2012).
Summary and conclusions
Post-reform China educational policy has implemented an aggressive affirmative action
college admissions policy for minorities (Zang 2008). This paper considers the extent
to which such a policy has been effective, and if conditional on college/university qual-
ity, the labor market returns to a baccalaureate degree varies by ethnicity in China.16
Our inquiry permits an assessment as to how effective post-reform efforts have been at
eradicating ethnic inequality through enhancing access to higher education. To the ex-
tent that the transition to a more market-oriented society increases the responsiveness
of earnings to the quality of human capital (Zhong 2011; Li et al. 2012), our consider-
ation of educational quality permits insight into whether or not in China, there is a

labor market return to college/university quality (Long 2008, 2010), and if it differs be-
tween minorities and the Han majority.
We have used data from the 2002 Chinese Household Income Project Series (CHIPS)
to estimate the labor market returns to graduating from college relative to high school.
We allow for selection and heterogeneous returns by ethnicity, and estimate three treat-
ment parameters that enable identification of the returns to a baccalaureate degree for mi-
norities in China, and how it varies by the quality of the institution awarding the degree.
We estimated three treatment parameters that enable identification of the returns to
a baccalaureate degree for minorities in China, and how it varies by the quality of the
institution awarding the baccalaureate degree. Consistment with heterogeneity in the
returns to education (Henderson et al. 2011) our estimate of treatment effects reveal
that for minorities, the average treatment effect of earning a baccalaureate degree from
colleges/universities ranked good and very good is high relative to the Han majority,
and for those actually receiving the treatment from colleges/universities ranked good,
and would be positive for those who could have earned a baccalaureate degree from
colleges/universities ranked good and very good, but did not. Our results suggest that
post-reform affirmative action education policies in China have been effective at im-
proving the education and labor market outcomes of minorities. Estimates of the aver-
age treatment effect on the non-treated suggests that existing minority-Han disparities
can be eliminated by further expanding the pipeline of minorities that complete high
school and enter into colleges/universities that grant baccalaureate degrees.
Our results provide a useful alternative context for evaluating affirmative action in col-
lege/university admissions in the USA. We find, for example, that the relative return for
minorities graduating from ranked universities is higher, and would also be for those who
could have attended, but did not. This suggests that proponents of the mismatch hypoth-
esis in the USA--the idea that at least some minority students who attend elite institu-
tions in the USA would be better off in non-elite institutions--could be wrong. Our
findings raise the possibility that, as in China, the relative returns to graduating from an
elite university could be higher for minority groups in the USA, and that affirmative ac-
tion in college/university admissions should be expanded so as to facilitate convergence in
the returns to a baccalaureate degree between minority and majority groups.
Our inquiry provides a research perspective on how ethnicity and inequality intersect
with public policy in China that can potentially inform how policy can address raced-
based educational disparities elsewhere. In the USA, affirmative action in higher
education has been controversial, with the presumed benefits and efficacy becoming in-
creasingly questioned on empirical (Arcidiacono et al. 2011) and theoretical grounds
(Fryer and Loury 2005). The results reported here provide some insight on how deliber-
ate affirmative action policies in universities admissions can increase the return to col-
lege graduation in a country--China--that has a history of minority relative to majority
ethnic group disparities in educational outcomes similar to the USA.
There are at least two limitations of our analysis. First, our results are based on a
cross section of China's labor market in 2002. Since that time, the Chinese economy
has grown substantially, and it is possible that in response to such growth, the pipeline
of minorities into colleges/universities and the labor market has been enhanced in such
a way the labor market returns on a baccalaureate degree for minorities has converged
to that of the Han majority. As such, our findings could just be a transitory snapshot of
Ding et al. International Journal of Anthropology and Ethnology (2017) 1:3 Page 9 of 13
a labor market that no longer exists. Second, our identification strategy imposes an ex-
clusion restriction based on whether or not a respondent moved to the rural country-
side during the cultural revolution. While the assumption that this instrument is
uncorrelated with unobservables is untestable, the extent to which it is a good instru-
ment could affect our Heckit estimates of the treatment effects. However, in all the
Heckit estimates, the intellectual youth variable was negatively correlated with each
measure of having earned a baccalaureate degree. This suggests that having moved to
the countryside during the cultural revolution is correlated with observable schooling
choices--earning a baccalaureate degree--that is not likely dependent upon unobserv-
able preferences for schooling investment decisions.
The central contribution, however, of this paper is that it reveals the weakness in the
so-called "mismatch hypothesis" underlying affirmative action. The mismatch hypoth-
esis posits that a policy regime of affirmative action in college/university admissions in-
creases the likelihood that a minority student is matched to a school that does not
optimize her chances for success (Arcidiacono et al. 2011). Our results suggest that, at
least in China, ethnic minority students admitted to colleges/universities under a policy
regime of affirmative action fare better in the labor market relative to majority ethnic
groups when earning a baccalaureate degree from high quality colleges/universities.
This finding underscores a conceptual weakness in the mismatch contention and af-
firms that affirmative action in college/university admissions can be an effective policy
tool to redress/remedy historic discrimination against minority groups.

7More specifically, ATENT measures the mean gain that the non-treated would have
realized if they had been treated (Moffitt 1999).
8In general, conditioning the treatment effect on individual characteristics allows for
an estimate of a conditional average treatment effect (Imai and Ratkovic 2013), in
which the response to the treatment is idiosyncratic and/or subject to compositional ef-
fects (Tsai and Xie 2011; Xie 2013), which if ignored could lead to biased estimates of
treatment effects.

Individual Income, Consumption, and Employment Data, 2.) Urban Household Income,
Consumption, and Employment Data, 3.) Urban Individual Annual Income Data 4.)

Data, 7.) Rural Household Income, Consumption, Employment, Social Network, Quality
of Life, and Village Affairs Data, 8.) Rural School-Age Children Data, 9.) Rural-Urban
Migrant Individual Data, and 10.) Rural-Urban Migrant Household Data. We use the data
compiled by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/21741.
10The 2002 CHIPS was administered by China's National Bureau of Statistics, and re-
lated to their household surveys, of which the methodology is described by Li et al. (2008).
11While political variables are not typically included in Mincerian earnings equations,
we include a dichotomous indicator of Communist Party membership as there is
evidence that it appears to matter for earnings in China (Li et al. 2007).
12Our parameterization of the heterogeneous treatment effects with selection into
the treatment follow that of Cerulli (Cerruli 2014), where for outcome y and
treatment w: E(y  x, z, s) = o
+ w + xo
+ w(x - x
) + 1
w[(z)/(z)] +
o
(1 - w)[z)/1 - (z)], where o
is the ATE, s is the binary college graduation
treatment, z is a vector of variables determining selection into treatment,  is the
vector of coefficients for z, and () and () are the density and cumulative
normal distribution respectively. The relevant treatment parameters are: ATE(x) =
 + (x - x
), ATET(x) = [ + (x - x
) + (0
+ 1
) × (z)  w = 1], and ATENT
= [ + (x - x
) + (0
+ 1
) × (z)  w = 0].
13We used a Stata module called IVTREATREG to estimate the treatment effects with
selection and heterogeneity, which is available at http://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/
s457405.html. While IVTREATREG provides alternatives to Heckit to estimate treat-
ment effects when the treatment is endogenous, Heckit permits estimation when both
the binary treatment choices and outcomes depend upon a linear combination of both
observable and unobservable factors.
14For the heterogeneous treatment specifications, we could not estimate the parame-
ters with the household weights as STATA does not enable the use of sampling weights
with bootstrapped standard errors. However, to the extent that bootstrapped standard
errors enable consistent estimation of parameters given misspecification (Goncalves
and White 2005)--in this the omission of sampling weights--bootstrap estimates of the
treatment effects without the sampling weights can mitigate/eliminate the bias caused
by the sample that may not be fully representative of the population of interest.
15Card (1999) posits that OLS estimates of the labor market returns to schooling are
downwardly biased as a result of individuals with high discount rates choosing low
levels of schooling, which have a higher marginal rate of return.
16Zang (2008) describes these post-1977 affirmative action policies as reflecting the
desire of the Communist Party to promote inter-ethnic peace and political stability.
With respect to college admissions, relative to the Han majority, minority students are
admitted into colleges/universities with lower admission test scores. In addition, minor-
ities are given a preference over the Han majority in hiring if they have similar or
slightly lower qualifications.
