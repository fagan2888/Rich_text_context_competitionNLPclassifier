Introduction
The purpose of this article is to devise a process framework
as a guide to meet the challenge of successfully developing
and managing visitor attractions (VA) in a small island devel-
oping state (SIDS) with special reference to Trinidad and
Tobago (TT), a two-island Caribbean state. TT is a country
comprising two small islands with Trinidad as the main
island of 4,828 square kilometers (1,800 square miles) with a
population of 1.3 million people, and Tobago significantly
smaller at 300 square kilometers (160 square miles) in area
with a population of 55,000 people. The economy of Trinidad
is based on the drilling and production of crude oil and natu-
ral gas, whereas Tobago is tourism oriented. The economy of
the country is based on the petroleum sector that accounted
for an average of 42% of the gross domestic product (GDP)
of the country over the period 2007 to 2011 as indicated by
the Government of the Republic of TT (GORTT; 2011).
The argument presented in this article is that the small
islands of the Caribbean cannot continue to rely on market-
ing efforts to sustain tourism based on natural resource assets
such as beach and marine resources, but must embrace a
more holistic approach that includes the identification and
development of a broad range of attractions within an effective
process framework. Such a properly developed and profession-
ally managed portfolio of VA will add significant value to TT
as a tourist destination and will strengthen the destination man-
agement system. One of the foremost researchers of VA,
Swarbrooke (2002), indicated that attractions are generally
individual entities, separate sites, or small geographical
areas. Destinations, however, are physically larger and com-
prise a series of attractions with relevant support services.
Importantly, when attractions develop they evolve into desti-
nations in themselves with services, such as hotels, restau-
rants, and shops, complementing the attraction activity
(Swarbrooke, 2002). The justification for VA management,
according to Swarbrooke, is the frequent conflict among dif-
ferent activities at sites which require a management system
that reconciles the needs of users with the conservation
imperative.
The rationale for pursuing this study is the declared strat-
egy of the government of TT to use tourism as a major devel-
opment pillar in the quest to diversify the economy away
from heavy reliance on hydrocarbon resources as the main
source of public revenue (Ministry of Planning and the
Economy [MPE], 2011; Ministry of Tourism [MT], 2010;
Neaves, 2012). This strategy will present a challenge
because, based on the latest available data, visitor arrivals to
TT declined from 461,051 in 2006 to 387,559 in 2010,
reflecting the continuing impact of the global recession that

Small Island Visitor Attractions: A
Development Process Framework
Haven Allahar1
Abstract
This article proposes a process framework for developing and managing visitor attractions (VA) in small island developing
states with Trinidad and Tobago, a two-island state in the Caribbean, as the case study. An extensive literature review was
conducted, supported by field observations, individual depth interviews, and small and large focus group meetings. The
process framework identified four sets of processes: national policy formulation and legislation; inventory, classification,
evaluation, and ranking of VA; general operations management involving project management activities; and site specific
activities of development, operations, and maintenance. The value of the framework lies in the fact that no similar framework
applicable to small islands was covered in the literature and validation was obtained from a panel of experts and a cross
section of tourism stakeholders in Tobago.

commenced in 2008 (Tourism Development Company
[TDC], 2011).
The study concept is that a major gap exists in the
approach to tourism development in TT, which the creation
and execution of marketing strategies will not fill. This gap
was indentified in the study as the absence of an explicit pro-
cess that can be adopted by the relevant stakeholders for pro-
viding an acceptable tourism product. In this regard, the
article suggests that the focus should be on developing an
appropriate process framework that integrates the insights on
tourism development obtained from the literature and exami-
nation of the various frameworks and models proposed, and
primary research involving interviews with tourism practi-
tioners, focus group meetings with key stakeholders, and
consultation with an expert panel of academics and practitio-
ners in the field of tourism.
The portfolio of VA in the small islands of the Caribbean
usually comprises natural assets such as beaches, nature
parks, historical/heritage sites, and festivals and events with
limited man-made attractions. The traditional approach of
tourism promotion is to focus on destination issues such as
external advertising, attendance at fairs, and entertaining air-
line and tour operators. This approach contributes to the gap
identified that results in a relative neglect of the condition
and management of the existing portfolio of VA. The focus
on VA is supported by the literature on tourism that asserts
that VA are the core of any tourism industry but an under-
researched area (Balkaran & Maharaj, 2013; Kusen, 2010;
Leask, 2010; Swarbrooke, 2002). It is argued that VA form
the basis of the tourism destination product but have not been
given the attention deserved, and a consequence of this treat-
ment is that potential VA are not of interest to tourism
researchers and practitioners (Kusen, 2010).
There is a reasonably vast body of literature on the gen-
eral subject of tourism and several journals address different
aspects of the subject, but the focus tends to be on areas, such
as destination marketing and management, ecotourism, sus-
tainability, cultural/heritage tourism, and generalized devel-
opment models, which were one-dimensional treating with a
specific element or groups of elements of the tourism system
(Brown & Cave, 2010). The specific area of VA is generally
under-researched, and the review of the relevant literature
was undertaken against this background.
In terms of the sequence followed in the article, the fol-
lowing sections are presented: a review of the relevant litera-
ture on island tourism, destination planning and management,
and development models, frameworks, and systems to ensure
the novelty of the study output; the case of TT as representa-
tive of a SIDS; method; results; discussion of the proposed
VA process framework and operations management process
structure; results verification; limitations of the study; and
concluding remarks.
The main output of the study is the completion of a VA
development process framework (FVA) that addresses the pol-
icy/legal superstructure, inventory and classification system,
evaluation and ranking system, and operations management
requirements as these activities specifically relate to the
development and management of VA. The framework adds
to the body of research on VA which focused mainly on site-
specific management requirements despite acknowledgment
of the fragmented nature of the FVA sector (Leask, 2010).
The FVA was validated by a review panel of Caribbean and
international experts comprising academics and practitioners
in the field of tourism. The FVA was refined based on feed-
back from the panel, and the final FVA was presented to a
broad stakeholder group in Tobago where it gained accep-
tance. A significant benefit of the FVA is the ability for easy
adaptation of the framework to the circumstances of other
SIDS, especially in the Caribbean.
Literature Review
The literature review was restricted to the areas judged as
most relevant to the study and included reviews of island
tourism because the case relates to small islands in the
Caribbean; destination management, competitiveness, and
governance because this is where tourism promoters in SIDS
traditionally concentrate their efforts often ignoring the vital
role of VA in shaping a destination; and tourism development
models, frameworks, and systems to check how existing
models can inform the proposed model in this study and to
confirm the originality of the proposed FVA.
The literature on island tourism is relevant because the
subject of the study is two small islands and Henderson
(2001) indicated that there was an increasing academic inter-
est in the subject of island tourism. However, Moyle, Croy,
and Weiler (2010) pointed out that interest was more focused
on the Pacific and Greek islands while other researchers
studied the cases of the off-shore islands of Singapore
(Henderson, 2010) and the Marshall Islands (Collison &
Spears, 2010). The definitive work on island tourism was a
special issue reviewed by Brown and Cave (2010) who iden-
tified four themes: island tourism as a distinct field of study
defined by the nature of place, people, and processes; island
culture and heritage tourism products that are integrated with
contemporary lifestyles and landscapes; marketing culture
and heritage products linked to destination sustainability;
and planning and management which are critical to island
tourism sustainability. The themes highlighted by Brown and
Cave are directly applicable to the SIDS of the Caribbean,
and the process framework proposed in this article addresses
these themes to the extent that they impinge on the central
concern of heightening the role of VA in the overall tourism
schema.
The literature on the small islands of the Caribbean is
relatively sparse as confirmed by the work of Lu and Nepal
(2009) who conducted a content analysis of the Journal of
Sustainable Tourism for the 15-year period 1993 to 2007 and
found that only 6% of tourism studies were done on the Latin
American region to which TT belongs. Works of significance
Allahar 3
were produced by a relatively small group of researchers
(Carlsen, 1999; Harrison, Jayawardena, & Clayton, 2003;
Jackman & Greenidge, 2010; Kenneth-Hensel, Sneath, &
Hensel, 2010; Nicely & Palakurthi, 2012). Harrison et al.
studied the challenges faced by tourism development in the
SIDS of the Caribbean islands and identified critical con-
cerns as exclusive nature of tourism facilities, undue influ-
ence of foreign investors, disconnect between policy and
practice, narrow definition of tourism, lack of integrated
tourism planning, need for resource management because of
small size, lack of a common vision, and lack of visible intel-
lectual leadership. Harrison et al. (2003) concluded that there
was a need for education and research and particularly devel-
oping case studies of best practice in responsible tourism
policy, planning, and development. However, Harrison et al.
did not highlight the role of VA in the identification of the
need for resource management and did not propose a model
for addressing the issue.
Research was done on Jamaica (Kenneth-Hensel et al.,
2010; Nicely & Palakurthi, 2012) and Barbados (Jackman &
Greenidge, 2010) as leading Caribbean island tourist destina-
tions. The Jamaican studies focused on the island's 10-year
tourism master plan and a tourism options navigation model
as a strategic development tool. The Barbados study was
concerned with modeling tourism flows to the island. These
studies were limited, in the case of Jamaica, to perceptions of
managers to the plan and visitor spend, and the level of eco-
nomic, social, cultural, and environmental impact. In the
Barbados case, the main concern was measuring tourist
arrivals to the island. Island economies that are based on
tourism are vulnerable to the economic cycles, and according
to Brown and Cave (2010), the "tourism-based economies of
the Caribbean experience discontinuous investment, delayed
marketing and construction" (p. 90). This observation by
Brown and Cave cannot be disputed from the recent evi-
dence of the impact of the 2008 recession that translated into
declines in visitor arrivals to the Caribbean (World Travel
and Tourism Council, 2014).
The analysis of the literature on island tourism revealed
that VA do not feature significantly in the research consider-
ations because the main attractions in islands are beaches and
marine attractions which dominate the product portfolio of
the Caribbean. The literature also confirmed that the top five
subject areas studied were tourism impact, sustainability
assessment, general development, visitor behavior and atti-
tude, and planning (Lu & Nepal, 2009). This position is curi-
ous in view of the study of destination brand components by
Balakrishnan, Nekhili, and Lewis (2011) who found that lei-
sure tourists perceived destinations as important for "tourist
attractions (28%); history, culture, and experience knowl-
edge (26%); food, shopping, and entertainment (12%); cli-
mate (7%); and local people and relationships (10%)" (p.
17). The development framework proposed in this article
goes beyond the narrow limitations of beach and marine
attractions to include a broader range of attractions identified
in the field research undertaken.
The research areas of destination management, competi-
tiveness, and governance are a major focus in the literature
with studies covering issues such as visitor numbers and
expenditure, employment creation, and social impacts
(Carlsen, 1999); management of the actual journey under-
taken by a visitor from booking of visit to exit (Lane, 2007);
the role of the destination management organization (DMO);
Magas, (2010); managing tourism experiences (Ritchie,
Wing Sun Tung, & Ritchie, 2011, p. 427); management tech-
niques for specific sites (Leask, 2010, p. 162); destination
network management and strategic tourism planning
(Ladeiras, Mota, & Costa, 2010; Meriläinen & Lemmetyinen,
2011); the structure of destination management, competitive-
ness, and governance (Baggio, Scott, & Cooper, 2010;
d'Angella, De Carlo, & Sainaghi, 2010; Ritchie & Crouch,
2003); and a planning framework (Dredge, Ford, & Whitford,
2011).
Destination management according to Magas (2010) is
"the tourism activity which engages local interests within
meaningful business cooperation with the offer holders, in
order to form the destination product" (p. 1046). Magas also
argued that a tourism destination is a complex system and
destination management comprises many sub-systems that
are generally "decentralized and fragmented" and thus
require "coordinated activity" (p. 1043). It is precisely an
emphasis on the destination product as represented by VA
which provides the justification for the framework devel-
oped in this article.
The oft-cited Ritchie and Crouch (2003) study is directly
applicable to SIDS and contained insights that were used in
formulating the framework presented in this article, although
the work remains largely conceptual. The work of d'Angella
et al. (2010), in developing governance archetypes, described
the fragmented model as a characteristic of many destina-
tions that lack a proper strategy at the destination level. The
fragmented model described by d'Angella et al., accurately
portrays the TT situation, where a high level of fragmenta-
tion provides further justification for the value of the frame-
work proposed in this pa The model most relevant to VA was
a planning and management framework (Dredge et al., 2011)
that outlined elements of sustainable development, good
governance, inclusivity and ownership, rigorous planning,
and effective marketing and promotion. This framework
consolidated the key elements of the tourism system and,
although tourism resources were included, the importance of
VA was not highlighted.
Overall, the approaches to destination management, com-
petitiveness, and governance presented in the literature were
conceptual in their formulation, strategic in nature not opera-
tional in character, specific to certain sites but without the
capacity for easy generalization of lessons, and did not
emphasize the role of governmental agencies that usually
occupy the position of the DMO in most SIDS. The general
assumption that VA are properly managed because they are
mainly privately owned does not hold with respect to SIDS
where public sector agencies dominate, poor management is
4 SAGE Open
the norm, and the development of VA is not a prominent pur-
suit (d'Angella et al., 2010). Thus, the major gap in the litera-
ture that this article aims to fill is the presentation of a
development framework for VA that is flexible and appropri-
ate to the physical and management resources of SIDS in the
Caribbean. In a sense, the elements of a VA management
framework constitute the hardware of the tourism complex,
whereas the overall destination management inputs represent
the software.
The tourism industry is often viewed as a complex busi-
ness that motivated researchers to devise models, frame-
works, or systems to deal with the complexity of tourism as
a service activity (Anuar, Nazrin, Ahmad, Jusoh, & Hussain,
2012; Fernando & Long, 2012; Mattsson, Sundbo, &
Fussing-Jensen, 2005; Vujici, Ðorðevic, & Vujici, 2010).
The relevance of a discussion of tourism development mod-
els is based on the objective of the article to formulate a pro-
cess framework applicable to TT as representative of the
tourism requirements in SIDS. The models most relevant to
VA were offered by Mattsson et al. (2005) who described an
"attractor-based tourism innovation system"; Vujici et al.
(2010) who emphasized the competitive environment, tour-
ism products, strategies, and policies; the community and
public and private actors; and market segments; and Hughey
et al. (2004), Kusen (2010), and Hassanien and Dale (2011)
who studied systems for classifying attractions. Kusen con-
cluded that an underdeveloped tourism area required a basic
functional classification system of VA.
The models discussed in the literature did not present a
complete example of what could be applicable in a SIDS
such as TT, but were useful in tracking the state of knowl-
edge in the area covered in this article. The classification sys-
tems suggested in the literature require significant adaptation
and were generally limited in their application to small
islands. The proposed FVA represents a distillation of what
was relevant from the literature, the particular insights gained
from the models and systems reviewed, and the creation of a
unique framework that can be applied in most small island
tourism development planning strategies. The adoption of a
VA process framework is distinct from a destination manage-
ment model in that the latter deals with the entire tourism
industry from promotions, booking of flights, accommoda-
tion, tour operators, and tourist services. VA are the major
components of a tourism product portfolio that tends to be
left to autonomous development particularly in TT.
The Case of TT
The development and management of the tourism product
has never been approached in a systematic manner in TT as
evidenced by official neglect (Trinidad and Tobago Chamber
of Industry and Commerce [T&T Chamber], 2013. In fact,
the only significant publications that address tourism include
a master plan that was published in the 1990s (The ARA
Consulting Group Inc., 1995), a strategic tourism develop-
ment plan (Tourism Technical Secretariat [TTS], 2004), and
a national tourism policy statement (MT, 2010). The ARA
report was the most significant study of tourism develop-
ment undertaken in TT, and it recommended a diverse mix of
resort tourism, ecotourism, specialty segments such as div-
ing, cruise tourism, yachting, events and festivals, and enter-
tainment and culture. Tobago was seen as strong in diving
with potential for ecotourism in a tranquil setting with a
product mix that included a national park system, marine
areas and reefs, hotel/resort areas, historic and garden attrac-
tions, entertainment experiences, scenic tours and ecotour-
ism activities, and natural, cultural, heritage, and event sites
and attractions. Apart from the existing natural attractions,
the recommendations remain unfulfilled. The portfolio of VA
in TT include pristine beaches with unpolluted waters; eco-
tourism attractions, such as coral reefs, rain forests, swamps,
and leather-back turtle nesting; industrial tourism sites of oil
and gas production and petrochemical estates; a natural pitch
lake; historical and heritage buildings from the Spanish and
British colonial era; and festivals and events, including the
major carnival parade in the region. A map of VA locations in
TT is shown in Figure 1.
The TTS (2004) emphasized sustainable tourism to be
achieved by focusing on high value added tourism, ensuring
environmental sensitivity, establishing ongoing asset man-
agement, recognizing the need for authenticity, developing
an effective institutional structure, conducting proactive
marketing, and sustaining investment in human resource
development. The implementation record of these objectives
was poor as revealed by the key indicator of the travel and
tourism competitiveness index (TTCI). Blanke and Chiesa
(2011) ranked TT in position 84 in 2009 of 125 countries
with an improved position of 79 in 2011, which placed TT in
position 16 overall in the Americas. The TTCI comprises 15
elements grouped under three main sub-indexes: regulatory
framework, business environment and infrastructure, and
human, cultural, and natural resources. However, the devel-
opment and management of VA is excluded from consider-
ation in the TTCI.
The most recent efforts to address the aspect of tourism
policy are contained in reports by MT (2010) and the MPE
(2011). The MT proposed the development of an overarching
national policy framework for sustainable development of
TT and a viable tourism sector based on strong public/private
sector partnerships, inclusion and support of the national
community, emphasis on the rich plurality and cultural diver-
sity of the people, and strategic application of modern infor-
mation communication technology platforms to ensure
efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
Tobago is considered the tourism island of the two-island
state of TT and the only recent published study of Tobago's
tourism sector focused on a quantitative analysis and model
of the sector (Kairi Consultants Limited, 2012). Kairi
Allahar 5
utilized data from interviews with stakeholders and statistics
generated by the tourism satellite accounts (TSA). Data limi-
tations narrowed Kairi's analysis to the accommodation sec-
tor of the tourism product portfolio, but due recognition was
given to VA, transport, travel organization, and destination
organization as important components of the tourism system.
With this recognition, Kairi identified the specific tourism
assets of Tobago as marine reefs, rain forests and other natu-
ral phenomena, cultural artifacts and monuments, music and
art, and a variety of festivals. The latter elements can be cat-
egorized as eco-cultural tourism which Pociovaliteanu and
Niculescu (2010) argue can be a viable development option
for communities with a low resource base but with rich cul-
tural heritage and natural landscapes.
In general, the potential of VA becoming the core of the
tourism offerings in both Trinidad and Tobago has not fully
captured the imagination of the policy and planning officials.
This position is confirmed by the T&T Chamber (2013)
observation that "the majority of these beautiful buildings
and sites have been neglected through an ignorance of their
importance as historical landmarks and the basis of our cul-
tural identity."
Method
The study of VA in TT used a social constructivist worldview
in that the search delves into the complexity of views relying
on the participants' views of the issue using open-ended
questions. The study more specifically adopted qualitative
research methods geared to producing results that permit the
introduction of a new development and management system
for which precise measurements are not possible. The quali-
tative method represents a distillation of the dominant onto-
logical and epistemological themes which convey that
knowledge is socially constructed and understood through
collection of data from multiple sources (Carter, 1999b;
Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2009).
The relevance of qualitative research is that it draws data
from people (individuals or groups); organizations; texts;
settings and environments; objects, artifacts, and media
products; and events and happenings. Furthermore, the
researcher was immersed in the area of study by interacting
with people and things to provide depth and detail. The sam-
pling method used was non-probability purposive sampling
with the sample sites drawn from the database of the TDC,

the major DMO. Interview and focus group participants were
selected as those judged to be the main individuals, private
organizations, governmental agencies, and stakeholders in
the tourism industry. The VA selected for an observation
study were those ranked by the TDC as the most popular
among local and foreign visitors. The criteria were based on
the special characteristics, and economic and historical sig-
nificance of the VA which accords with the approach by
Daengbuppha, Hemmington, and Wilkes (2006).
The data collection process observed the following strate-
gies peculiar to a qualitative research design: explicit clarifi-
cation of researcher bias; triangulation of data by examination
of evidence collected through document analysis, site obser-
vations, individual depth interviews, and focus group inter-
views, and establishing the themes that emerged based on
convergence of the different data sources; repeat site visits
for observation of physical conditions; use of thick, rich
description to convey the findings, thus providing several
perspectives about the themes; and peer debriefing by having
the study reviewed by an eminent professor and researcher.
The actual collection of data utilized four traditional qual-
itative research techniques that included a field observation
study of 40 sites (Trinidad, 22 and Tobago, 18), individual
face-to-face depth interviews with 25 persons, a large focus
group of 30 persons, and a small focus group of 7 persons.
The observation study involved visits to selected sites and
attractions with the objective of assessing and determining
the current state of physical development of the respective
sites in terms of access, visitor facilities, security, parking,
and so on; the potential for future development in relation to
the site characteristics; current management practices,
including marketing, in the context of the experience and
knowledge of international best practices regarding visitor
reception, satisfaction, and general acceptability; issues of
ownership and marketing; and the capacity to incorporate a
mix of attractions in any one site or cluster of sites. The site
visits resulted in the comprehensive documentation of the
physical condition of and the management arrangements for
VAwhich confirmed that the gap in the professional manage-
ment of VA was real.
The face-to-face interviews were conducted using a dis-
cussion guide to facilitate open discussion during the depth
interviews. The guide was developed based on the insights
gleaned from the literature review and the observation study
of the VA and covered the following issues: development
matters relating to quality standards, carrying capacity, and
infrastructure problems; management issues relating to prac-
tices, the tourism system, and site organization; operations
management such as security, signage, waste disposal, res-
taurants, and parking; ownership of facilities; marketing
strategy; and funding arrangements. The guide was provided
to the participants as a means of preparation that provided
interview flexibility to be able to capture emergent issues
(Carter, 1999a, 1999b).
The large focus group was conducted in Trinidad whereas
the small focus group met in Tobago, and in both cases, the
interview discussion guide was used to obtain the views of
the stakeholders on the key issues stated in the guide.
The data analysis process followed the steps recom-
mended by Creswell (2009) in which the individual activities
were interactive and interrelated and comprised organizing
and preparing the data for analysis by gathering transcrip-
tions of field, interview, and focus group notes; reading
through all notes and related information to distill the sense
and meanings from the data; coding the data based on the
pre-assigned themes identified in the discussion guide and
adding any new themes or participants' meanings that
emerged from the interactions; describing the themes using a
rich narrative; and interpreting the lessons learnt to inform
the result.
Results
The overwhelming result from the data collection and analy-
sis was that the modern tourists who visited TT were less
interested in beach tourism and more excited by the ecotour-
ism and heritage attractions. However, it was acknowledged
that the vast majority of attractions, although capable of sig-
nificant value to visitors because of their uniqueness, did not
encourage customers because of their condition. In this con-
text, the major finding of the study was that an observable
deficiency exists in the overall structure for developing and
managing the relatively wide range of existing VA, and the
distinct need was the formulation of a process framework
within which the development and management components
can be rationalized, systematized, and operationalized. The
key areas of deficiency were stated as follows: the absence of
a consistent policy toward the development of VA bordering
on neglect of VA as integral to the tourism product, unavail-
ability of a comprehensive database of VA and a system for
classifying the various attractions, the absence of a method
for evaluating VA so as to rank them in importance, and the
lack of coherent operations management arrangements that
detail the critical system requirements such as project man-
agement, development activities, daily operations, and gen-
eral maintenance.
The field visits to the 40 VA established that, for small
islands, a diverse complex of attractions existed, including
natural attraction of beaches, rivers, river gorges, waterfalls,
rain forests, and marine reefs; cultural/heritage attractions
comprising colonial buildings from the French, Spanish, and
British eras, indigenous music and dance, local literature,
films, and plays, and heritage festivals; man-made attrac-
tions such as museums; and performing arts centers, sporting
arenas, and universities' campuses. The observations of VA
found that considerable improvements were needed in terms
of access, visitor facilities, security, parking, and related ser-
vices. The conclusion from the observations of sites was that
Allahar 7
the management of VA was deficient in most cases with a
few exceptions in Tobago.
This conclusion was consistent with the position of
Tourism Intelligence International (TII; 2003) which, based
on a tourism inventory study, found that the responsibility
for development of VA in Trinidad was shared by agencies
with no single point of reference for ensuring compliance
with rules and implementation of standards. The case of
Tobago was different in that VA development and manage-
ment resided with the Tobago House of Assembly (THA)
which resulted in a higher level of management of the tour-
ism product in that island. TII also pointed to severe weak-
nesses in facilities and services and suggested the adoption
of an innovative approach with regard to the design, con-
struction, implementation, maintenance, and upkeep of VA
facilities, including a community management approach par-
ticularly at the strategic tourism product development stage.
The findings from the depth interviews and focus group
meetings in Trinidad highlighted the relatively poor quality
of infrastructure inclusive of site access, availability of utili-
ties, and waste disposal. The general response was that
greater attention needed to be paid to the infrastructure
development of existing sites and recognition of potential
attractions, including privately owned sites. The matter of
carrying capacity was also of concern to many users and
stakeholders, with a call for setting limits to the number of
visits to some areas. It was suggested that other development
models should be studied and a VA development plan be pre-
pared. A critical finding was that vast improvement was
needed in the management of VA if international standards
were to be achieved. The application of appropriate manage-
ment techniques, such as the creation of a management struc-
ture, the construction of interpretative centers, and training
of staff, were considered indispensable. The management
deficiencies were reflected in the poor state of maintenance
of the majority of facilities at VA locations.
In the specific case of Tobago, both the stakeholders who
were interviewed, and the participants in the small focus
group commented that the management of VA was uncoordi-
nated and there was uncertainty about roles and responsibili-
ties of agencies. Furthermore, it was suggested that an
organization be created to manage and promote all VA in
both islands on a collaborative basis. In respect of managing
protected areas, a parks authority was recommended to over-
see park management for protected areas, with participatory
management from key stakeholders and involving the local
communities. Regarding facility management, it was felt that
partnering among the organizations involved in tourism was
a superior approach to individual efforts. At the operations
management level, there was need to provide for proper dis-
posal of waste, control of vending, prevention of sexual
harassment, and contracting local communities to maintain
facilities. The findings are consistent with the view that
"those entrusted with the oversight of our heritage assets lack
this basic understanding of their great value and do not pos-
sess the vision to tap into their tremendous economic poten-
tial" (T&T Chamber, 2013).
Discussion
Proposed VA Process Framework
Based on the research carried out and the key findings, this
article proposes a FVA that integrates the various processes
of the complex tourism system as described by Hughey et al.
(2004), and which is applicable to a SIDS such as TT. The
design of the FVA emerged from the expressed views of the
key stakeholders who participated in the study. Destination
management activities in TT concentrates on getting the visi-
tor to the country while implementation of the FVA will
strengthen the general management system by focusing on
the value-adding component of VA, thus promoting repeat
customers. The FVA detailed in this article represents an
addition to the knowledge on models for developing and
managing VA in SIDS because the existing models do not
address small islands where governments are the prime mov-
ers and financiers of tourism-related development. In this
way, the model proposed is more akin to an integrated col-
laborative system that acknowledges public and private
inputs, rather than a destination management model that is
driven by a DMO.
The FVA is outlined as a process model (Figure 1) that
integrates four levels of activity to fashion the develop-
ment framework: national policy level, VA identification
level, general management level, and individual VA level.
At the national policy level, the requirement is for the cre-
ation of a policy and legal superstructure to guide the VA
development process. The requirement for a policy frame-
work was reinforced by Henderson (2010), who suggested
that due regard be given to legal and regulatory frame-
works, and Vujici et al. (2010), who identified a signifi-
cant role for governments in the "planning, creation, and
design of the policy, managing infrastructural systems,
creating and enforcing regulations, developing of stan-
dards, and monitoring" (p. 1363). The review of the policy
and legal regulatory environment in TT indicated the
absence of a coherent guide with little acknowledgment of
the critical role of VA in the tourism package (MPE, 2011;
TTS, 2004).
At the VA identification level, the key activities involve
completing an inventory of all VA and devising a relevant
classification system (Figure 1). The focus group interviews
pointed to the need to clarify the definition of attractions
which is an issue faced in the research literature (Hughey et
al., 2004; Kan, Wang, & Yan, 2009; Swarbrooke, 2002). The
VA industry is very complex, and this complexity is exacer-
bated by the difficulty in arriving at precise definitions of
attractions. Based on a distillation of the research on the
issue, this study arrived at a definition of an attraction, appro-
priate to small islands, as
8 SAGE Open
a site or facility that receives over 1,500 visitors per year,
whether local or foreign, and has an identified management
structure.
In seeking to develop a schema for classifying VA, this
study utilized the work of Kusen (2010), Marr (2011),
Hassanien and Dale (2011), Swarbrooke (2002), and Inskeep
(1991). The most comprehensive categorization of VA was
undertaken by Kusen who identified 16 attractions and com-
pleted a functional classification of these attractions to which
was linked 16 key data characteristics applied to each attrac-
tion type represented as a 3D figure. The FVA proposes a
simpler classification according to three broad categories of
attractions: natural, comprising coastal and marine, environ-
mental and landscape, and parks and protected areas; cul-
tural, made up of historical and heritage, traditional, and
events; and man-made, including business facilities and con-
ferences, entertainment, and sporting facilities and events.
Natural resource attractions typically cover attractions
that occur naturally in the environment and encompass
coastal and marine resources, landscape features and envi-
ronmental assets, and parks and protected areas. Cultural
attractions span the historical and heritage assets of a com-
munity including: traditions; aesthetics; values and customs;
craft, music, arts, dance or drama; rituals and tribal customs;
festivals, interpretive centers, foods, and special events.
Man-made attractions cover a range of activities, including
business facilities and events, entertainment, and sporting
facilities and events.
There are attractions that do not fit neatly into any single
category and include recreational and entertainment attrac-
tions. Recreational attractions provide either active or pas-
sive outdoor recreational activities directly dependent upon
the natural or man-made elements of the landscape, or activi-
ties such as touring, hiking, scuba diving, and golf.
Entertainment attractions provide visitors with an experience
that typically involves amusement, pleasure, fun, and/or
excitement. These attractions usually take the form of man-
made facilities designed for audiences beyond just the local
community, and include shopping malls, casinos, live the-
ater, tourist districts, farmers' markets, and theme parks.
Educational attractions (Edutainment), which is a grow-
ing area of the tourism attractions business, include both
natural and man-made attractions whose primary aim is to
provide visitors with learning and or enrichment opportuni-
ties from a social, business/industrial, cultural, scientific, or
historical perspective. The intent is to provide an experience
that provides visitors with the opportunity to develop/acquire
knowledge, skills, or abilities. Interpretation, from a learning
or educational perspective, must be provided either through
print material, signs, guides/interpreters, or special program-
ming (i.e., seminars, class-room instruction). Educational
attractions include interpretive centers, zoos, scenic tours,
theme parks, plant tours, and conservation areas.
The next step in the process is to evaluate and rank attrac-
tions, and the FVA incorporates an evaluation and ranking
system for VA in SIDS based on best practice gleaned from
the literature and reflected in the following criteria: access in
terms of travel time, and availability of reliable public trans-
port or organized tours to the attraction; existing level of use
in relation to carrying capacity; uniqueness and distinctive-
ness characteristics; quality measured by authenticity and
representativeness; sustainability as evidenced by conserva-
tion measures, authenticity of cultural representations, com-
munity identity and employment for local residents, and
effective management structures and practices; local level
and national importance; and international awareness and
recognition (Figure 2).
The ranking of VA is vital for tourism planning purposes,
and the development of innovative management strategies.
As such, a methodology is proposed which incorporates a
scoring method, the results of which can be used to rank VA.
Based on the suggested evaluation criteria, a score can be
assigned to an attraction depending on the level of satisfac-
tion of the specific criterion on the following scale:
0 = criterion not achieved in any respect;
1 = low level of achievement of the criterion;
2 = moderate level of achievement of the criterion;
3 = high level of achievement of the criterion.
However, to ensure that the evaluation criteria utilized are
balanced, value weights (0-3) are assigned on the relative
level of importance of the criteria. In this regard, the criteria
that are more related to the intrinsic nature of attractions are
given the greatest weight, in particular, the criteria of quality
and sustainability are considered as best representing the
underlying nature of attractions and deserving of greater
emphasis in evaluating the attractions. The remaining four
criteria are viewed as more subject to external influences on
their value, thus the assignment of the greatest weights on the
intrinsic qualities of an attraction will offset any disadvan-
tage that a high-quality feature might experience as a result
of the more external influencing factors such as access to and
level of use of the attraction.
Based on the scale described in the ranking method and
the specific weighted criteria, VA can be ranked by multiply-
ing the level determined on the scale of 0 to 3 by the respec-
tive weights. This scoring system goes beyond the assessment
of asset importance proposed by Hughey et al. (2004) who
scored VA as of low, moderate, or high importance based on
naturalness, ecological context, cultural significance, and
socioeconomic importance. The scoring system proposed in
this article generates a total weighted score that reflects the
level of satisfaction of the evaluation criteria which permits
the allocation of VA to classes based on total score calculated
as follows: Class I (25-36), Class II (13-24), and Class III
(0-12). This approach removes some of the subjectivity
embedded in the Hughey et al. method.
Class I attractions are the most outstanding attractions,
particularly in terms of intrinsic qualities, activity programs,
and supporting infrastructural facilities; strong links with
Allahar 9
other attractions with potential to form clusters of attrac-
tions; display of high levels of developmental, environmen-
tal, and socioeconomic sustainability; presence of an
effective management structure for regular maintenance; and
accessibility to induce optimum visitor levels consistent with
carrying capacities. Such attractions provide for the best of
the visitor experience and constitute the premier attractions
in the country and the focal points in the system of visitor
sites and attractions.
Class II attractions are high-quality attractions with an
appropriate range of activities and facilities that offer develop-
ment potential, features that are well known nationally and
that are environmentally sensitive and community responsive,
and good access attracting visitor levels below carrying
capacity, but require improvement in the management prac-
tices to optimize visitor use.
Class III attractions are the average type of attractions that
are important for the tourism sector and offer basic recre-
ational and educational experiences, and function as stand-
alone features catering mainly to a local resident population.
Such attractions require improvement in management prac-
tices, activity programs, supporting infrastructure, environ-
mental systems, site access, and enhanced marketing and
promotion.
Implementing a VAclassification, evaluation, and ranking
system is crucial for small islands, because of the pervasive

concept of "sun, sand, and sea" as comprising the core attrac-
tions to the exclusion of cultural, heritage, and other natural
attractions. The system outlined in this article is proposed as
significantly easier to implement in small islands where the
DMOs are traditionally under-resourced.
Operations Management Process Structure
The operations management process structure (Figure 3)
covers the project management level and the critical activi-
ties to be implemented at the individual VA sites that are
acknowledged as the most deficient areas in SIDS (Harrison
et al., 2003; Magas, 2010). The project management respon-
sibility is considered a central-level function to be carried out
by the TDC in Trinidad and the THAin Tobago as the respec-
tive DMOs. Magas detailed the responsibilities of the DMO,
which cover co-ordination and cooperation as the main tools
of resource management. The objective of the DMO is to
create useful partnerships and achieve balanced tourism
development on the conviction that consolidation of knowl-
edge, similar capabilities, capital, and other resources, can
provide competitive advantage of a destination (Magas,
2010). Based on the assessment of VA sites from this
research, project management activities must focus on
upgrading of major facilities, constructing interpretation
centers, pursuing product development, diversifying owner-
ship, securing funding, establishing codes of practice and
quality management, and managing the entire framework
through adopting a knowledge management approach as pro-
posed by Zehrer (2011).
Operational collaboration can be achieved between public
and private agencies by pursuing site-level implementation
functions through a combination of public sector agencies,
non-governmental organizations, community-based organi-
zations, and public­private partnerships. Implementation
actions demand deep collaboration and involvement with the
community in development activities, operations manage-
ment, and maintenance, because these are the critical activi-
ties that dictate whether the visitor has a satisfactory
experience (Kan et al., 2009; Moyle et al., 2010; Shikida,
Yoda, Kino, & Morishige, 2010).
The development of attractions involves attention to sev-
eral critical areas at the implementation level. Increasingly, the
wisdom of involving the community in a consultative process
is being recognized, and this practice is particularly relevant to
SIDS like TT. A procedure for selecting suitable VA is critical
to the development process, which is the precursor to the
detailed site planning activity. A vital consideration in the

selection and planning of VAis accessibility as emphasized by
Brown and Cave (2010). At the implementation level, the
managers of VA are required to mobilize the development
finance to ensure a viable product. The development of VA in
SIDS is often dependent on financial assistance from gov-
ernmental agencies which Swarbrooke (2001) argues is nec-
essary for creating a climate within which the attractions
sector can flourish.
Operations management covers the routine management
of VA such as interacting with the local community as
emphasized by Kan et al. (2009) and Harrison et al. (2003),
ensuring facilities display acceptable standards, training of
staff because "small islandness imposes particular nuances
upon the management of human resources" (Baum, 2012,
p.124), awarding concessions for support services, devising
user fees, managing risk, measuring performance, and ensur-
ing adequate security of visitors. Creating user-friendly oper-
ational management systems that enhance the visitor
experience is a big challenge, but these help to remove obsta-
cles to visitor enjoyment. Thus, operations management is in
many ways the key to customer satisfaction and optimizing
financial performance. Operations management as the small
island level must focus in the future on effective manage-
ment of attractions which Leask (2010) argues is not based
on numbers of visitors, but engagement with stakeholders
and employment of management practices appropriate to the
site, resource, and the visitors.
Maintenance responsibilities encompass basic cleaning
and landscaping, preventive building care, establishing plant
nurseries, major construction and upgrading, and processing
of events. The dynamic integration of these components at
the operational level is what will determine the success of the
FVA in achieving effective management of attractions, and is
consistent with the themes identified in the literature and
elaborated in this article (Carlsen, 1999; Kan et al., 2009;
Kirovska, 2011; Lu & Nepal, 2009; Meriläinen &
Lemmetyinen,2011;Swarbrooke,2002;Watson,McCracken,
& Hughes, 2004). A high standard of maintenance must be a
requirement for including any site or attraction in local and
international promotional efforts (Figure 2).
Results Verification
To verify the originality and functionality of the results of
this study, the proposed framework was submitted by email
to a review panel of Caribbean and international experts. The
expert panel comprised academics and practitioners in the
field of tourism, who were identified based on the research-
er's knowledge of influential persons in the Caribbean envi-
ronment, and authors of the journal articles covered in the
literature review related to VA management.
The experts reflect a wide range of involvement and
expertise in tourism studies and operations, and experiences
garnered from varied locations in the world. The comments
of 14 experts, 6 of whom are Caribbean based and 8 interna-
tionally based, were received, checked, and assessed by the
researcher for relevance, and where applicable, the com-
ments were incorporated into the framework design.
To verify the applicability of the results to the Tobago
case study, the researcher presented the final FVA to a group
of Tobago stakeholders at a seminar hosted by the Tobago
Hospitality and Tourism Institute (THTI). The participants in
the seminar comprised students of tourism, board members
and faculty of the THTI, senior representatives of the
Division of Tourism and the Division of Finance and
Enterprise Development of the THA, and tourism industry
operators and stakeholders. An immediate follow-up session
focusing on the operations management processes was con-
ducted by the researcher with the faculty of the THTI, board
members, and managers of the Division of Tourism. The
general consensus was that the FVA was highly applicable to
the Tobago situation and implementation of the structure will
be tested.
Limitations of the Study
The study focused on the destination supply side by looking
at visitor sites and attractions, and did not treat in-depth with
the demand side of what encourages tourists to travel to a
destination, nor the areas of visitor experiences. The study,
therefore, is limited to the extent that foreign visitors were
not interviewed for views on their experiences. In qualitative
research, repeat interviews are considered important to the
validity of the findings. Such repeat interviews could not be
arranged at mutually satisfactory times and would have
incurred significant additional cost. The findings are limited
in this respect, although the researcher is confident that the
findings would not have required significant amendments.
The final limitation is that the proposed system was not
tested with the sites and attractions developers and managers
to gain an insight into the potential workings of the system.
This limitation can be overcome by future action research,
the opportunity for which is likely to arise in Tobago.
Concluding Remarks
The literature on island tourism pointed to a gap regarding
the management of VA in the studies of the Latin American
region to which TT belongs. Several models, systems, and
frameworks were explored, but the models tended to focus
on specific elements, such as destination management and
collaborative systems, rather than an integrated model.
d'Angella et al. (2010) identified four models, but indicated
that the fragmented model was the most common and sug-
gested a model should be devised to achieve operational bal-
ance, although they did not detail such a model. The major
finding of the study was that an observable deficiency exists
in the overall structure for developing and managing the rela-
tively wide range of existing VA in TT, and the distinct need
was the formulation of a simple operational framework within
which the development and management components can be
rationalized and systematized. The framework presented in
12 SAGE Open
this article is an attempt to formulate such a simple frame-
work which is represented as a process that, if implemented,
will constitute a major advance in the coordinated manage-
ment of VA in SIDS. This position was confirmed through
feedback on the proposed framework received on its presen-
tation to a stakeholder seminar comprising mainly tourism
sector practitioners which was convened at the THTI for the
expressed purpose of testing the applicability of the FVA to
Tobago.
The VA component of the tourism complex in small
islands constitutes the core of the product offerings, and
DMOs need to recognize that tourism sustainability demands
that a framework or system is created within which the pro-
fessional development and management of such attractions
can take place. Because of the vulnerability of tourism in
small islands, the managerial focus is inescapable if such
islands are to become competitive in an increasingly dynamic
industry. As stated by Ritchie et al. (2011), a new manage-
ment paradigm emerged, which focuses on mass customiza-
tion of visitor experience design and delivery. Ritchie et al.
argued that a "first step in developing such a management
paradigm is to assist managers to fully understand the nature
of the tourism experience in all its forms and at all levels" (p.
420).
The FVA proposed in this article is both innovative and
value adding to both academic researchers and tourism
industry practitioners in that it reflects a multidimensional
approach which incorporates the key system components as
opposed to the uni-dimensional approach lamented by Anuar
et al. (2012), Moyle et al. (2010), Lebe and Milfelner (2006),
and Carlsen (1999), a rationalization and integration of the
various models which seek to classify and categorize sites
and attractions and place them into classes, the development
of an easily applied evaluation and ranking system appropri-
ate to SIDS, and a framework clearly locating the responsi-
bilities for the policy and legal dimensions, planning,
categorization, and evaluation at the organizational level,
and an operations management framework for project man-
agement and implementation of development activities,
operations, and maintenance. Future research should be con-
ducted to assess the results of implementing the FVA.
