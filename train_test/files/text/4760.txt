Abstract: Hirschfeld's (2008) thoughtful comments on my article on the bilingual brain are a
valuable contribution to what I find to be an exciting and fruitful interdisciplinary investigation
in evolutionary linguistics. I think his reply will help us flesh out both the biological and the
environmental forces that have led to the human endowment for language. Even so, Hirschfeld's
conclusion ­ that the well-known difficulties which adults face in acquiring second languages are
somehow proof of an environment in which early hominid bands frequently commingled - is at
variance with virtually everything we know from the many disciplines that are now involved in
the debate over the evolutionary origins of language.
Keywords: bilingualism, language acquisition, evolutionary psychology.

In his reply to my article in Evolutionary Psychology, Hirschfeld argues that "what we
know about human language capacities leads to a very different conclusion" than the one I
expressed in Hagen (2008), namely that "[i]f language evolved in some group that did not have
sustained and peaceful contact with others, then a bilingual brain would not be of much use,
natural selection would not have favored it, and we would end up with exactly the state of affairs
we now have (pp. 57-58)." The state of affairs I was referring to is that children are endowed for
rapid and easy language acquisition and adults are not.
Perhaps the best way to put the disagreements between Hirschfeld and myself into
perspective is to point out that the actual ontogenesis of language ability, first or second, is one
of any number of logically possible ontogeneses. I can think of four such. Let us, for example,
imagine (1) a late acquisition scenario, according to which humans would experience onset of
language acquisition at a later age - say at ten years instead of two ­ but would retain a learning
potential throughout the lifespan. Next, let us imagine (2) a minimalist scenario, by which we
would be endowed with a bare-bones set of grammar rules something along the lines of an
artificial language like Esperanto that would be innately specified in all speakers of all
languages, so that adult second language acquisition would simply be the relatively easy matter
of acquiring the vocabulary of a foreign group. Then there is (3) a gradualist scenario by which,
say, onset of acquisition would be at a very young age but full fluency would not come about
until adulthood. And finally, let us imagine (4) an unbounded scenario, by which language
would develop in a brain of unbounded plasticity, so that adult second language acquisition
(SLA) would be no different than child first language acquisition. Whenever adults or children
learn a new language, they would just start from scratch.

The debate we are now having boils down to this: Why did evolution select our actual
ontogenesis of language rather than one of these possible ones? Hirschfeld tries to answer this
question first by arguing that "that the ease with which children simultaneously learn multiple
languages evinces a state of sustained cooperation and exchange between groups such that
speakers of different groups, speaking different languages, recurrently commingled over long
periods of time" (pp. 182-183) It is worth noting in the first place that the end of Hirschfeld's
discussion includes a strong argument against this position. He writes that "the period during
which most complex cognitive functions evolved was characterized by extremely sparse
settlement patterns," (p. 184) which hardly counts as "evidence for an ancestral environment in
which distinct groups commingled through long-term trading and marriage relationships) in
relative security" (p. 182). I should point out as well that when linguists describe childhood
language acquisition as "rapid," they mean rapid with respect to (a) the complexity of the task,
and (b) the laborious pace at which adults manage to do the same thing. In reality, it takes about
two years of sustained (not occasional!) exposure for a child to become a fluent speaker of a
language.
Hirschfeld further argues that child bilingualism is "all the remarkable since some of the
processes that enable bilingual acquisition (e.g., establishing two distinct lexicons) would
otherwise seem to compete with processes that enable single language acquisition (e.g., a single
word for each whole object)" (p. 183). Hirschfeld is wrong on both counts. Language acquisition
is nothing at all a process of "learning a single word for each whole object." A child may learn
many words for a certain "whole object" like a certain small friendly animal, e.g., dog,
dachshund, hound, pet, Fred, animal, canine, mutt, animal, beast, critter, etc. Even among
monolinguals, learning synonyms has no negative effect on prior learned knowledge. And as I
pointed out in my original article, learning new words is the one aspect of language acquisition
that is not adversely affected by age.
It is true, as Hirschfeld notes, that children can acquire several languages without
significant decrement to first language acquisition. But then, so can adults: they just can't do it
nearly as easily as children can. Hirschfeld cites this in support of his position by arguing as
follows:
During the period in which young children acquire their first language, they are
capable of (and often do) acquire several languages without significant decrement to
first language acquisition. This ability to effortlessly acquire several languages is a
singular design feature of the LAD. What other complex cognitive skill is unaffected
by doubling or even tripling the acquisition task? (p.183)
The short answer to his rhetorical question "what other complex cognitive skill is unaffected by
doubling or even tripling the acquisition task?" is "almost all of them." Mathematics is surely
cognitively complex, but one's understanding of addition is not adversely affected by a
subsequent learning of multiplication, and learning multiplication, in turn, is not adversely
affected by the simultaneous learning of division. A gifted musician can learn or even compose a
richly elaborate symphony for 30 or more instruments without adversely affecting her knowledge
of other symphonies she has learned, or is learning. Moreover, the most current research in
theoretical syntax has shown that languages do not vary in any but the most superficial ways (see
Baker, 2002; Boeckx, 2006). The mystery for theoretical linguists is not that children can acquire
more than one language, but that they can acquire abstract linguistic principles in the first place.
Next, Hirschfeld turns to the acquisition of foreign accents (almost always a dead
giveaway of someone who has acquired a language in adulthood) and their relevance to
Hagen replies to Hirschfeld

prehistoric raiding parties and the subjugation of fertile women. His hypothesis leads him to the
essentially meaningless conclusion that "a language learner's propensity not to acquire foreign-
accented pronunciation seems a plausible feature of an evolved LAD." Under the circumstances
he describes, the victim of an intergroup raid will acquire the accent of her captors, so long as
she is kidnapped at a young age. It is only when she is captured and kidnapped after adolescence
that she will acquire the language of her captors with difficulty, and therefore retain traces of her
first-language pronunciation. It is difficult to see how those facts support the view of an ancestral
environment in which distinct groups typically commingled in relative security.
Finally, Hirschfeld writes:
Much of my speculation here is based on a fairly simple observation: in terms of
complex cognitive mechanisms, it is less languages that have evolved than language
acquisition devices. Increasingly more complex linguistic structures emerged as
distinct LADs evolved, presumably as adaptations to challenges grounded in shifts in
the human and nonhuman environments. (p. 184)
It is not at all clear what this is intended to prove. The evidence that languages have evolved ­
and have done so in ways that parallel natural evolution to an uncanny degree - is immense and
irrefutable. The discipline we call historical linguistics would be as pointless as phrenology if
languages did not mutate over time. In fact, as I pointed out the original article, language
mutation and language drift are evidence of long periods of cultural isolation; still more evidence
against Hirschfeld's hypothesis. Plausibly the LAD (actually, it's now called UG for "Universal
Grammar" in most linguistic work) did evolve in the 2 million year history of the genus Homo.
However there is no evidence that it has evolved appreciably during the 200,000-year history of
Homo sapiens, and there is no evidence that linguistic structures have become cognitively more
complex. What happened before the advent of Homo sapiens is anybody's guess. Whatever our
actual evolutionary history was, the one thing that is clear is that our brains did not evolve in a
manner that facilitates adult language acquisition. Ironically, that is the one fact that Hirschfeld
does not even try to explain in his reply.
All told, the view of prehistory that emerges from Hirschfeld's hypothesis is that
Pleistocene hunter-gatherers lived in small bands that were widely diffuse across the Eurasian
and African continents; that they traveled at the whims of migratory animals on which they
depended; that they nevertheless managed to stay in permanent contact with other small bands
that were following other herds; that they did so with no sophisticated means of communication;
that their children stayed with these other bands for years at a time in order to become fluent in a
foreign language, and that adults did not (or else they too would have evolved an endowment for
easy language acquisition); that this was a universal habit of hunter-gatherer bands that resulted
in a universal endowment for bilingualism; that all children of all bands participated in these
foreign exchange programs; and that in spite of these common interactions, there later evolved
thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, of mutually incomprehensible languages. The only
motivation we have for accepting this implausible scenario is a lingering distaste among some
anthropologists for the Hobbesian view of humanity before civilization.
The constraints on adult SLA make a lot more sense when we compare our language
phylogeny to a more familiar case. When Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands, he was struck by
the variety of giant tortoises (Darwin 1845/1957, pp. 359-361). The regions of the Galápagos
where the vegetation grew close to the ground were inhabited by tortoises with a domed carapace
that limited upward mobility of the animal's neck. The regions where vegetation was higher off
the ground, on the other hand, were inhabited by animals with longer limbs and an arched
Hagen replies to Hirschfeld

carapace that allowed the neck to reach vegetation on bushes. The job of the naturalist is to figure
out what sort of history led to this state of affairs. Surely the tortoises were not purposefully
designed in that way: the parsimonious solution would have been to create only arched-shells,
which are no impediment to eating vegetation on the ground. Surely the two subspecies did not
commingle among the islands, because then we would expect to see arched and domed carapaces
equally distributed across the islands (or, more likely, only one phenotype). The truly bizarre
state of affairs would have been to find the domed shelled tortoises on islands where brush is
abundant, and the arched shells on islands where there is no brush. A nearly equally bizarre state
of affairs would be to find hunter-gatherer adults who had a flair for second language acquisition
even though it did them no good. In other words, if our hunting-gathering ancestors lived in a
world "characterized by extremely sparse settlement patterns" as Hirschfeld asserts, then an
endowment for adult second language acquisition would have been for them what an arched
carapace would be for a tortoise living on an island with no bushes, i.e., a trait that would have
brought with it no survival advantages and therefore would not have made the evolutionary cut.
