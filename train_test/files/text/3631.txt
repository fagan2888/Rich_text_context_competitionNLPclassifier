Introduction
Surveys remain fundamental to the study of public opinion
and political behavior. At the same time, a number of sig-
nificant developments over the past few decades have
transformed survey methodology. One notable develop-
ment is the rise of Web-based surveys (see Baker etal.,
2010). With increased public accessibility of the Internet,
researchers collect survey data from thousands of partici-
pants at a lower cost and quicker pace than ever before
(Couper, 2000, 2011).
Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is one example
of a useful Internet-based resource. MTurk allows researchers
to easily recruit participants and administer surveys at little
cost: Consequently, it has emerged as a prominent data source
among researchers of U.S. public opinion (e.g., Arceneaux,
2012; Gerber, Huber, Doherty, & Dowling, 2011; Huber, Hill,
& Lenz, 2012; Huber & Paris, 2013). However, MTurk sam-
ples include only individuals who opt into MTurk and com-
plete a given survey, leading to samples that are typically
unrepresentative of the U.S. population.Afair amount of work
shows that MTurk samples consistently differ from popula-
tion-based samples of the American public on many demo-
graphic and political variables (Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz,
2012; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Huff & Tingley,
2015; Ipeirotis, 2010; Krupnikov & Levine, 2014; Mullinix,
Leeper, Freese, & Druckman, 2015).1 Nevertheless, a growing
literature focusing on the generalizability of experimental
research using MTurk data finds that with some exceptions,
researchers can make credible, generalizable experimental
inferences with some confidence (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012;
Krupnikov & Levine, 2014; Mullinix etal., 2015).
We update and expand on this body of work by compar-
ing an MTurk sample and a population-based sample
designed to be representative of the U.S. population on a
larger range of demographic and political variables than
most previous work, namely, a host of attitudinal and behav-
ioral measures. Of greater importance, we address whether
easily measurable features can explain raw descriptive sam-
ple differences; that is, can differences between the samples
in more specific variables be explained by more basic and
well-known demographic and political variables? If so,
MTurk samples could provide a fruitful resource for hypoth-
esis generation and testing for observational researchers of

The Demographic and Political
Composition of Mechanical Turk Samples
Kevin E. Levay1, Jeremy Freese2, and James N. Druckman1
Abstract
One of the most notable recent developments in survey research is the increased usage of online convenience samples
drawn from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). While scholars have noted various social and political differences (e.g.,
age, partisanship) between MTurk and population-based samples, the breadth and depth of these variations remain unclear.
We investigate the extent to which MTurk samples differ from population samples, and the underlying nature of these
differences. We do so by replicating items from the population-based American National Election Studies (ANES) 2012 Time
Series Study in a survey administered to a sample of MTurk respondents. With few exceptions, we not only find that MTurk
respondents differ significantly from respondents completing the 2012 ANES via the Web but also that most differences are
reduced considerably when controlling for easily measurable sample features. Thus, MTurk respondents do not appear to
differ fundamentally from population-based respondents in unmeasurable ways. This suggests that MTurk data can be used to
advance research programs, particularly if researchers measure and account for a range of political and demographic variables
as needed.

public opinion, so long as they account for at least these
basic variables where differences usually exist. If not,
MTurk respondents may fundamentally differ from those in
population-based samples in ways that will misdirect infer-
ences in observational studies and that cannot be corrected
simply by weighting the sample by measurable features. In
either case, researchers of public opinion, including experi-
mentalists, will gain more clarity about when and how they
might adjust their sampling strategy and procedures to meet
their particular needs.
To address these issues, we replicate items from the
American National Election Studies (ANES) 2012 Time
Series Study in a survey administered to a sample of MTurk
respondents. We compare MTurk respondents with a popu-
lation-based sample who completed the 2012 ANES survey
via the Web. We document numerous and many less-noted
raw differences, though most are consistent with one another
and extant research. Yet, we also find that, with some excep-
tions, once we control for a short set of relevant variables,
approximately nine, the effects of being an MTurk respon-
dent diminish considerably. In short, most differences
between respondents in our MTurk and population-based
samples do not seem to reflect unobservable distinctions,
but rather variation on factors that researchers might expect
and can easily capture.
Our results suggest that, if used with care, observational
researchers can use MTurk for developing a research program
in that the data will generate useful inferences on which to
build (i.e., they should not generate an unusual number of false
negatives or false positives). However, we do not suggest that
MTurk is a wholesale substitute for population-based samples,
nor that controlling for the covariates we identify here is a uni-
versally effective formula. In addition to some evidence show-
ing that MTurk samples might under- and overrepresent some
groups differently at distinct points in time, we also find some
inexplicable and less well-noted differences. Our point, then,
is that if researchers account for most basic sample features,
they can effectively use these measures to adjust observational
data (e.g., using sampling weights) so that inferences can
often, though not always, be generalized to larger populations
(see Callegaro etal., 2014, for discussion).2 In other words,
while perhaps not ideal for observational research, with exten-
sive and careful measurement, MTurk can be used with some
confidence for theory development.
In addition, our results further clarify when experimental-
ists expecting heterogeneous treatment effects by some char-
acteristic should be more or less careful when using MTurk.
Although by no means definitive, our findings suggest that
even where MTurk underrepresents individuals with a given
characteristic, these researchers can proceed with some con-
fidence that increasing the number of people with that char-
acteristic in their sample might be sufficient for properly
estimating treatment effects across or among those individu-
als. In any case, researchers of all kinds should always
analyze and situate their findings in the context of their sam-
ple, both in process and composition.
We begin with a brief discussion of MTurk and the ways in
which samples drawn with MTurk most commonly differ
from population-based samples. Next, we describe our data--
how we recruited and collected data from our MTurk sample,
as well as the features of our comparison population-based
sample who completed the 2012 ANES. We then present the
results of our analysis, showing a number of basic raw obser-
vational differences, but also evidence that many, though not
all, of these differences are reduced considerably with the
inclusion of easily measurable covariates. We conclude with
suggestions for researchers interested in using MTurk to con-
duct surveys who might be concerned with MTurk sample
composition.
MTurk and MTurk Samples
MTurk is an online crowdsourcing labor market launched
by Amazon.com in 2005. Individuals and organizations
(requesters) use MTurk to hire humans (workers) to com-
plete various computer-based tasks (Human Intelligence
Tasks or HITs). Requesters post HITs on the MTurk site and
can make HITs available to all MTurk workers or only
workers who meet a given set of requirements (e.g., an IP
address located in a specific geographic area). Upon com-
pletion of a HIT, requesters then either reject or accept indi-
viduals' work and reward them accordingly. Given that
MTurk now boasts a large number of workers willing to
complete any number of computer tasks for small sums of
money, it has become a popular resource among survey
researchers, as surveys can be posted as HITs for comple-
tion. For example, a Google Scholar search of "Mechanical
Turk" yields 1,080 hits from 2010; 2,750 from 2012; and
5,520 from 2014.
Nevertheless, MTurk respondents include those who opt
in to MTurk and a given survey, meaning that MTurk sam-
ples are unrepresentative of many specified populations.
This also means calculating respondents' chances of being
sampled is virtually impossible (see Baker et
al., 2010;
Couper, 2011). Thus, as reviewed in more detail below,
while MTurk samples are usually more representative than
other commonly used convenience-based samples, such as
college students (Berinsky etal., 2012; Buhrmester etal.,
2011; Casler, Bickel, & Hackett, 2013; Paolacci, Chandler,
& Ipeirotis, 2010), they consistently and clearly differ from
population-based samples aiming to be representative of the
U.S. population. Indeed, the use of MTurk has sparked con-
siderable debate, though there is emerging consensus that
MTurk is largely suitable for experimental work (Berinsky
et
al., 2012; Buhrmester et
al., 2011; Casler et
al., 2013;
Krupnikov & Levine, 2014; Mullinix etal., 2015; Paolacci
etal., 2010). There is no such consensus when it comes to
observational work, however.
Levay et al. 3
How do MTurk samples usually differ from the U.S.
population? Extant work shows a number of stable demo-
graphic differences between MTurk samples and U.S. pop-
ulation-based samples. MTurk samples tend to have lower
average incomes, higher average education levels, lower
average ages, and much smaller percentages of most non-
White groups, especially Blacks (Berinsky et
al., 2012;
Buhrmester etal., 2011; Huff & Tingley, 2015; Ipeirotis,
2010; Krupnikov & Levine, 2014; Paolacci & Chandler,
2014).3 Similarly, differences in political identity appear to
be mostly stable, with MTurk samples frequently contain-
ing many more Democrats and liberals than population-
based samples (Berinsky etal., 2012; Krupnikov & Levine,
2014; Mullinix etal., 2015).
Existing comparisons are useful, but they do not consis-
tently capture all potentially relevant differences between
MTurk and U.S. population-based samples, nor do they
consider relationships between differences. This is espe-
cially true when it comes to specific political attitudes (e.g.,
government spending preferences, opinions about climate
change, gun control, etc.) and/or behaviors (e.g., contacting
a government official; although, see Berinsky etal., 2012,
who include some political variables, but do not analyze
relationships between differences on these and other vari-
ables). These gaps are notable, given that researchers using
MTurk most often want to make observational and/or
experimental inferences about attitudes and behaviors, as
well as about and across subgroups with particular
characteristics.
How consistent are the various differences of MTurk sam-
ples? Do MTurk samples differ in other ways than those that
are most often measured? More importantly, do they differ in
more specific attitudes and/or behaviors, and if so, can these
be explained by more basic demographic and political differ-
ences, or are they reflective of fundamental, potentially
unmeasurable features of MTurk respondents? If the former,
MTurk could be a relatively useful data source even among
observational researchers, as they can account for factors
that differentiate MTurk respondents from others. If the lat-
ter, the ability of researchers using MTurk to make infer-
ences would be more limited, particularly those wishing to
make observational inferences of various kinds, but also
researchers wishing to draw inferences about specific sub-
groups or who expect treatment effects to differ among spe-
cific subgroups who are less well represented among MTurk
respondents.
Data and Method
To address our questions, we turn to the ANES 2012 Time
Series Study. The ANES Time Series Study has been con-
ducted in every national election year since 1948 and is
one of the most extensive social and political surveys of
the American electorate. In 2012, for the first time in its
history, the Time Series Study was conducted both face-to-
face and over the Internet with two independent samples.
The sample who completed the Internet survey were mem-
bers of GfK's (formerly Knowledge Networks)
KnowledgePanel, a sample of U.S. households drawn
using random digit dialing and address-based methods.
Sampled households were drawn randomly from a listing
of addresses from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery
Sequence File and U.S. residential landline telephone
numbers. Households without a computer and/or Internet
access were offered a laptop and free monthly Internet
access from GfK in return for participation. A sample of
KnowledgePanel members, who were U.S. citizens and at
least 18 years old by the time of the 2012 presidential elec-
tion (November 6, 2012), was sent invitations to partici-
pate in the 2012 ANES. The sample includes 3,860
individuals who completed the 2012 ANES during the
2012 U.S. presidential election in four waves, two con-
ducted prior to the election (October 11, 2012 through
November 6, 2012) and two after (November 29, 2012
through January 24, 2013).4
The 2012 ANES is well suited for our purposes. To begin,
it provides data from a population-based sample that, with the
use of weights, is representative of the U.S. population. As
important, it offers data on a number of variables of direct rel-
evance to political and social science researchers and that
remain largely unexplored with respect to MTurk. Finally,
given completion of the survey via Internet by an indepen-
dently drawn, population-based sample, we can analyze and
compare the data from the 2012 Web ANES sample with data
from an MTurk sample while controlling for survey mode (see
Struminskaya etal., 2014 and Liu & Wang, 2015 on survey
mode effects).
We designed and administered a survey on MTurk replicat-
ing numerous questions from the 2012 ANES. While limited
by timing (i.e., not during or directly after the 2012 campaign;
see below), our survey included a range of questions, many of
which do not appear in extant work, thereby allowing us to
offer one of the broadest sample comparisons to date and to test
whether a number of sample differences can be captured by a
host of basic demographic and political variables. In addition to
a number of commonly measured demographics, such as age,
income, and racial and ethnic identification, we included less
consistently measured, as well as more specific demographics,
such as employment status, home ownership, and both reli-
gious identity and group affiliation. We also included a number
of opinion measures on salient topics, such as abortion, gun
control, government spending in numerous areas, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) rights, the environment,
and the general role of government, as well as behavioral mea-
sures, such as contact with an elected official, volunteering, and
media consumption habits. All questions were worded and
4 SAGE Open
randomized identically to the 2012 ANES, as well as ordered
according to the order in which they appeared in the survey
questionnaire.5
We made our survey available to MTurk workers on
June 10, 2013. Following others (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012;
Huff & Tingley, 2015; Krupnikov & Levine, 2014), we set
three requirements for participation: a HIT Approval Rate
greater than or equal to 90, at least 50 HITs approved, and
an IP address based in the United States. The survey was
advertised to workers as a national public opinion survey
that would take 20 to 30 minutes to complete, terms similar
to that of other work.6 We closed the HIT after 2 days, on
June 12, 2013, when we reached 2,000 unique survey
completions.
Given the advertised completion time, and to gather data
as quickly as possible, participants were compensated
US$2.50 upon completion of the survey. Although relatively
high, this amount is smaller than some (e.g., Huff & Tingley,
2015) and the rate per minute based on the advertised survey
completion time is roughly comparable with most other work
(e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012). Moreover, though not studied
systematically, there is little evidence to suggest that higher
compensation rates do more than decrease the amount of
time it takes to recruit participants (Buhrmester etal., 2011;
Mason & Watts, 2009; also see Paolacci & Chandler, 2014).
In short, given comparable recruitment methods, we believe
that our findings can be reasonably compared with those of
extant work.
Below, we first assess the breadth of social and political
differences between the samples and then consider the extent
to which they can be explained by measured characteristics.
We do so using regression analyses, first without covariates
so as to calculate the simple differences between MTurk and
2012 ANES Web respondents on various items--which we
call the "raw" differences--and then with basic covariates to
estimate whether and how much this resolves those differ-
ences. For all analyses, we exclude respondents for which no
response was given or "Don't Know" was chosen. We also
weight the ANES data to be representative of the U.S.
population.
Results
Raw Socio-Demographic Differences
Table 1 presents descriptive data for socio-demographic vari-
ables among each sample, as well as coefficients for an MTurk
dummy variable used in regression models of each variable
with no controls. The latter provides the size of a given differ-
ence between the samples and whether it is statistically signifi-
cant by conventional standards. Table 1 mostly confirms
differences found in prior work; the MTurk sample is younger,
more likely to be unmarried, lower income, and much less
racially and ethnically diverse than the ANES sample. The
average age of the MTurk sample is almost 20 years younger
than the ANES sample (31.6 years vs. 47.4 years). A much
larger share of the MTurk sample has also never been married
(60.3% vs. 25.7%). The average reported household income of
the MTurk sample is about US$10,000 less than the ANES
sample (~US$54K vs. ~US$65K) and a significantly smaller
percentage of MTurk respondents owns a home (37.8% vs.
72.1%). Finally, compared with the ANES sample, the MTurk
sample contains about the same percentage of Whites (71.8%
vs. 70.5%), but significantly smaller percentages of Blacks
(7.1% vs. 12.2%) and Hispanics or Latino/as (5.6% vs. 11.2%).
In addition, many more MTurk respondents report no race or
ethnicity at all (7.1% vs. 1.9%) or something other than only
those categories (8.6% vs. 3.7%).7 We also find a much larger
percentage of MTurk respondents are students (22.3% vs.
6.4%). Thus, as others find, despite being less well-off eco-
nomically, the MTurk sample is much more educated than the
ANES sample, with 45% of the MTurk sample possessing at
least a bachelor's degree versus only 29.5% of the ANES
sample.8
Interestingly, while some earlier work highlights that
MTurk samples underrepresent men (e.g., Ipeirotis, 2010;
Paolacci etal., 2010), our data exhibit the opposite pattern
(53.9% male). This finding, however, is consistent with
more recent work (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012; Casler etal.,
2013; Krupnikov & Levine, 2014). Similarly, though less
consistently measured across studies, our data appear to
contrast when it comes to religious identity. We find no dif-
ferences between the samples in any organized religious
group identifications (also see Berinsky et
al., 2012).
However, we do confirm previous findings on religious
beliefs and religiosity; a strikingly substantial percentage
of the MTurk sample--over 40%--identifies as agnostic or
atheist, whereas only 10% of ANES respondents does and
many fewer MTurk respondents attend church or religious
services (29.4% vs. 54.9%; see Paolacci & Chandler, 2014).
Given comparable recruitment methods, though specu-
lative, the above suggests that the composition of the
MTurk worker population might shift over time, at least on
some variables. Also, MTurk samples might differ at differ-
ent points in time on particular variables more than on oth-
ers, even where measured characteristics might seem
related (e.g., wider and more stable differences in religious
beliefs/religiosity vs. organized religious group identifica-
tion). While these are generally beyond researchers' con-
trol, as we discuss in the conclusion, it underscores the
utility of regularly measuring multiple demographic fea-
tures in multiple ways when using MTurk.

each variable without any controls. Consistent with previous
work, our MTurk sample is significantly more liberal and
Democratic than theANES sample. The mean ideology of the
MTurk sample is almost a full point lower on a scale of 1 to 7
(3.3. vs. 4.2, where 1 is extremely liberal) with 58.4% of the
MTurk sample identifying as between slightly liberal and
extremely liberal compared with only 27.8% of the ANES
sample. Similarly, a significantly larger percentage of MTurk
respondents identifies as Democratic (46.1% vs. 38.1%), and
a smaller percentage identifies as Republican (14.6% vs.
27.6%).
Our MTurk sample also differs significantly in political
preferences, though in ways that are consistent with other
work (e.g., Berinsky etal., 2012) and the samples' broader
political differences (i.e., preferences reflect the more lib-
eral, Democratic composition of the MTurk sample).
Relative to the ANES sample, the MTurk sample more
strongly favors environmental regulation of business, guar-
anteed jobs and income by government, increased spending
and services by the government, and a government health
insurance plan, as well as increased government spending
in many specific areas (e.g., on science and technology). In
addition, the MTurk sample expresses stronger support of
gay and lesbian marriage, abortion with no restrictions, and
stricter gun control laws than the ANES sample. Finally,
more respondents in the MTurk sample oppose offshore
Levay et al. 7
drilling, deporting immigrants, increasing immigration
restrictions, and the death penalty than in the ANES sam-
ple, as well as agree that global warming is happening, ris-
ing temperatures are bad, and climate change is caused
mostly by humans.
The MTurk sample differs less in terms of political
behavior. Similar and statistically indistinguishable per-
centages of MTurk and ANES respondents are likely to
contact elected officials (20.9% vs. 22.9%) and participate
in community work (28.5% vs. 30.1%). Relatedly, the sam-
ples are similar in terms of whether they have any say in
what government does, as indicated by virtually equal
means of 3.3 among the samples on a scale of 1 to 5.
Although these findings appear to contradict those showing
that MTurk respondents are less politically active (e.g.,
Berinsky etal., 2012), they are likely due to measurement
differences. Others have mostly gauged activity with mea-
sures of voter turnout and registration, activities for which
socio-demographic characteristics, namely age, are both
strongly related to being an MTurk respondent and less sig-
nificant predictors of the political activities measured here
(Schlozman, Verba, & Brady, 2012).
That said, the samples differ when it comes to news media
consumption, though in ways similar to recent work (Huff &
Tingley, 2015). The difference between the samples in the
average number of days spent getting news during a typical
week is higher for the MTurk sample, but only with respect to
Internet news (4.9 vs. 3.7). Alternatively, this average is about
a day higher for both print and TV news for the ANES sample
(2.1 vs. 1.1, and 3.8 vs. 2.6, respectively). Relatedly, the aver-
age level of attention paid to news among those who gather it
from print or television at least 1 day or more during a typical
week is lower among the MTurk sample (2.7 vs. 2.9 and 2.9
vs. 3.2, respectively, on a scale of 1-5), but higher when it
comes to Internet news gatherers (3.1 vs. 2.8 on a scale of 1-5).
These findings not only confirm previous work but also under-
score that even as it underrepresents some groups, MTurk
might be useful for attracting subgroups with more specific
qualities. That is, MTurk samples might do relatively well at
attracting large numbers of younger people who are highly
interested in news and older people who are not, at least com-
pared with population-based samples (see Huff & Tingley,
2015).
Multivariate Analyses of Socio-Economic
Differences
We now turn to the important question of whether differ-
ences diminish when including measured covariates or
reflect some fundamental and unmeasured distinction of
MTurk respondents. We select sets of the broadest, most
commonly measured covariates for which one can reason-
ably expect effects on more specific socio-demographic and
political variables.
Table 4 reports the coefficients for MTurk sample mem-
bership (vs. ANES) from regressions of every socio-
demographic variable, adding respondents' age, age2, gen-
der, and race and ethnicity as covariates; income and educa-
tion are covariates in all models except for when they are
outcomes.9 For categorical outcomes, reported coefficients
represent the average discrete change in the predicted prob-
ability resulting from being an MTurk respondent. We also
report the percentage reduction of the coefficients from the
models without any controls.
A quick glance at Table 4 suggests that differences
between the samples are not simply a by-product of their
more basic demographic characteristics. Indeed, being an
MTurk respondent remains a significant predictor for 21 of

35 variables, suggesting that other, unmeasured differ-
ences might exist among the samples. However--perhaps
more revealingly--there are substantial reductions in the
size of the MTurk coefficient across the models for most
every variable (i.e., the substantive difference of being an
MTurk respondent becomes quite small). The main excep-
tions are for employment status, earnings, and health
assessment. Thus, while remaining statistical differences

should not be dismissed, respondents in the MTurk sample
diverge much less from those in the ANES sample on most
variables once basic demographics are accounted for--
differences are more likely to reflect easily measurable
features.
Multivariate Analyses of Political Differences
We next reconsider differences in the political attitudes and
behaviors presented in Tables 2 and 3. We run regression
models for each variable, now adding nine covariates: age,
age,2 gender, race and ethnicity, income, education, whether a
respondent has never been married, whether a respondent
identifies as atheist or agnostic, political ideology, and parti-
sanship (the latter two are excluded when each is an outcome
variable).
The results in Table 5 show that, as with socio-demo-
graphic variables, being an MTurk respondent remains
statistically significant for most of the variables, 25 of
39. Nevertheless, the size of the coefficients is also
reduced considerably across the models for nearly every
variable, except for the number of days an individual
spends gathering news from the Internet during a typical
week. Even when statistically important, both the rela-
tive substantive impact of being an MTurk respondent is
much smaller than other variables and these other vari-
ables predict outcomes in expected ways. For example,
while statistically significant, an MTurk respondent is
only 0.25 points more supportive of government insur-
ance than an ANES respondent on a scale of 1 to 7, a
small increase not only by itself, but also compared with
the impact of other variables on such support, such as
ideology (see the appendix). There are only a few nota-
ble exceptions to this pattern, such as death penalty atti-
tudes and Internet news consumption. Overall then, as
with our analysis of demographics, MTurk respondents
do not appear to fundamentally differ (in terms of the
substantive size of the effect) on political variables once
we control for just a handful of variables, particularly
ideology and partisanship.10
To summarize, our samples differ in ways that are simi-
lar to previous work, though not exactly. In line with past
work, for example, our MTurk sample is much younger,
less racially and ethnically diverse, and more liberal and
Democratic than the ANES Internet sample. However, the
sample differs less or differently from previous work when
it comes to gender and organized religion. We also identi-
fied other less well-explored, though expected differences,
namely, attitudes on a number of different political issues
and policies. As important, we showed that the importance
of being an MTurk respondent is reduced in most instances
and negligible in many when controlling for relatively few,
broad, and relevant factors. In other words, the MTurk
sample differs from the ANES sample but this is explained
fairly well by measurable differences.
Conclusion
Amazon's MTurk allows researchers to recruit large samples
quickly at low cost. In turn, its presence among many types
of behavioral science research has rapidly expanded
(Bohannon, 2011). However, the relative representativeness
of MTurk samples raises some concerns over inferences
based on MTurk data, at least compared with those based on
data from population-based samples, namely, generalizabil-
ity (see Berinsky etal., 2012).
We sought to update and extend our knowledge of
MTurk samples by comparing an MTurk sample with a
nationally representative one on a large range of demo-
graphic and political variables. Our samples differed on
variables in similar ways as in past work, but also some not
included in extant scholarship. More importantly, these dif-
ferences are significantly reduced when accounting for nine
broad, measurable features by which MTurk samples differ
starkly: age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, education,
marital status, religion, ideology, and partisanship.
Importantly, this set of variables is slightly broader than
that most commonly identified as most consequential (e.g.,
age and ideology).
As a whole, these results imply that observational
researchers of public opinion can profitably use MTurk,
as long as they measure at least the nine covariates we
identify. Doing so will allow for the development of sam-
ple weights commonly employed when using other types
of opt-in samples. As Callegaro et
al. (2014) explain,
those who use non-probability samples (e.g., opt-in)
"argue that the bias in samples . . . can be reduced through
the use of auxiliary variables that make the results repre-
sentative. These adjustments can be made with . . .
[w]eight adjustments [using] a set of variables that have
been measured in the survey" (p. 13). What we have
done, then, is identified those variables that allow obser-
vational researchers to weight data from MTurk and
reduce potential biases.
Still, measuring the covariates identified here is not a uni-
versal, foolproof solution for observational researchers inter-
ested in using MTurk. We employed a particular recruitment
method and while broad in approach, nevertheless explored
particular variables. Moreover, differences remain, however
negligible, and some can apparently be inconsistent. Taken
together, this suggests that additional covariates are more or
less important to include depending upon the question at hand
and the timing of sampling.
Our results are also useful for experimentalists of pub-
lic opinion concerned with treatment effects that are
expected to differ by particular characteristics. While the
10 SAGE Open
representativeness of MTurk does not threaten experimen-
tal inferences in most cases (e.g., Mullinix etal., 2015),
one might nevertheless misestimate treatment effects if
groups who are expected to respond to an experimental
treatment differently than others are underrepresented
and/or differ in unmeasurable ways from others like them

who are not included in the sample. Importantly, however,
we find not only that the impact of being an MTurk
respondent is reduced when controlling for other factors,
but also that these factors behave in expected ways. While
not definitive by any means, this provides at least some
evidence that even while underrepresented, individuals
belonging to groups who opt into being an MTurk worker
that are underrepresented might not differ all that much
from those who do not. As such, researchers can proceed
with some confidence that increasing the number of peo-
ple with a given characteristic in their sample might be
sufficient for properly estimating treatment effects across
or among those individuals. In any case, researchers
should always analyze and situate findings in the context
of their sample, both in process and composition.
With the above in mind, as highlighted by others (e.g.,
Huff & Tingley, 2015), a promising approach for researchers
concerned with representativeness or with specific sample
needs is to employ software and sampling procedures aimed
at creating larger and/or targeted survey pools. While vary-
ing in the type and amount of resources required, programs
developed by researchers and other programmers, such as
MTurk R (see Leeper, 2013) and TurkPrime, as well as
implementing multiple demographic surveys on MTurk with
unique samples of workers, readily provide a means of creat-
ing samples with more diverse and/or specific demographic
and political characteristics. Thus, depending upon research-
ers' needs, these methods can be usefully leveraged to
address potential sampling issues introduced by using
MTurk.
To be sure, we reiterate that MTurk does not provide a
substitute for population-based samples; indeed, as men-
tioned, even with our set of covariates, sample differences
remained. However, with proper care and measurement
approaches, researchers can use it to adequately build research
programs. Our identification of key sources of sample differ-
ences offers a blueprint for what scholars can do in using
MTurk and in turn, maximize the likelihood that they can
draw useful inferences from MTurk. In sum, as with any
source of data, to get the most out of MTurk, researchers
should critically examine their sampling strategy and compo-
sition in relation to their expectations and the question at
hand.

Notes
 1. Mutz (2011) defines a population-based sample as one that is
representative of the target population of interest for a particu-
lar theory.
 2. The importance of having a probability-based panel (popula-
tion) sample for conducting observational research as opposed
to any type of opt-in non-probability sample remains debated
(Baker etal., 2010). What we have in mind, however, is that
researchers could use a wide range of measured variables to
adjust opt-in samples to more closely resemble population-
based samples (e.g., Gelman & Rothschild, 2014).
 3. Recent evidence, however, suggests that MTurk samples might
represent some, more specific, non-White subgroups fairly well,
such as younger, Hispanic females and Latinas, as well as mem-
bers of certain occupational categories (Huff & Tingley, 2015).

6. Keywords describing the Human Intelligence Task (HIT)
included survey, opinion, politics, public opinion, policy, and
demographics. The HIT description read as follows: Please par-
ticipate in the National Public Opinion Survey. It should take
about 20-30 minutes to complete the survey. The introductory
text to the survey read as follows: For this study, we would like
you to complete the National Public Opinion Survey. It has taken
others 20-30 minutes on average to complete. In appreciation of
your participation, we can give you $2.50 for completing the
survey. To receive compensation for taking the survey, you must
complete the entire survey. This requires you to both: Enter your
Amazon Worker ID at the designated spot at the end of the sur-
vey, and enter a unique numeric code (that we will provide you
with) into the designated Amazon Mechanical Turk screen.
 7. Respondents were able to select more than one racial category.
We recoded the data so that White includes respondents who
Levay et al. 17
selected only White, regardless of Hispanic/Latino/a identifi-
cation; Black includes only respondents who selected Black
and answered no to identifying as Hispanic or Latino/a;
Hispanic/Latino/a includes only respondents who answered
yes to identifying as Hispanic or Latino/a and did not select
White racial identification; Other includes only respondents
who selected at least one of the following: Asian, American
Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander,
other, or multiple categories (excluding those who identify as
Hispanic/Latino/a); no race includes only respondents who did
not indicate any racial or Hispanic/Latino/a identification.
 8. Tables only report means for ease of interpretation and space.

available in Appendix Table A1. Distributions for all other
variables are available from authors upon request.
9. We also ran models for income and education with controls
for age, age2, gender, and race/ethnicity. Full regression results
available in the appendix.
10. Interestingly, in one instance, support for regulation of business
to protect the environment, the MTurk coefficient remains statis-
tically significant but the direction changes; MTurk respondents
are less favorable once we control for differences in partisanship
and ideology. Nevertheless, as with most other variables, the size
of the coefficient indicates minimal substantive effect.
