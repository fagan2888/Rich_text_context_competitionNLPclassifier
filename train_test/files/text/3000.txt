We CPnducted a survival analysis to determine the effect of p,werty on mortality in a national sample of blacks and whites 25-74 years of age (in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and National Health Examination Fol­ low-up Survey). We estimated the proportion of mortality associated with poverty from 1973 through 1984 and in 1991 by calculating the population attributable risk. We assessed confounding by major known risk factors, such as smoking, serum total cholesterol, and inactivity. In 1973, 16. l % of U.S. mortality among black and white persons 25-74 years of age was attributable to poverty; in 1991, the proportion increased

to 17.7%. In 1991, the population attributable risk of poverty on mortality was lowest for white women, 1.7 times higher for white men, 2.6 times higher for black women, and 3.6 times higher for black men. Potential confounders explained 40% of the effect of poverty on mortality among women.
The proportion of mortality attributable to poverty among
U.S. black and white adults has increased in  recent decades and is comparable to that attributable to  cigarette  smoking. The effect of poverty on mortality must be explained by conditions other than commonly recognized risk factors. (Epidemiology 1995;6:490-497)

Low socioeconomic  position  is  widely  recognized  as  a risk factor for morbidity and mortal ity. 1- 10 Researchers
have  reported  dose-response  relations  or  associations
with mortality for diverse socioeconomic characteristics: education,11- 22 occupation and occupational  sta­ tus,11·12·19·2-2 lG employment, 27.3°- 32 health insu rance,33.34 income,11- -13 19·15    poverty  or  residence   in  a  poverty ar­
ea,36.37  and  regional  economic   conditions   and trends.11.l8    42 Socioeconomic   effects  exist  for  total mor­
tality   as  well   as  for  several   specific  causes  of death.
Socioeconomic position is also associated with morbid­ ity,  disability,  and  decreased  survival, 7.4-1   46   and  it ac­
counts for a substantial proportion of the excess mortal­ ity of blacks compared with whites in the United States.47.48 The literature indicates socioeconomic effects
on mortality in the United States, England and other European countries, New Zealand, and Japan. -8 -17 -18, 26 28- 30
In the United States and England, although socioeco­ nomic differences in mortality declined earlier in the 20th century, these differences have generally increased
  
Despite the well-known association between poverty and mortality, no recent study has examined the pro­ portion of mortality associated with poverty in the
United States. This lack exists partially because national vital statistics rarely include socioeconomic data.50- 52
Additionally, relatively few studies have assessed the extent to which multiple biological and behavioral risk factors contribute to observed socioeconomic gradients in mortality. Because knowledge about the societal effect and causes of social inequalities in health is important for health policy and health planning, 53 we conducted a study to estimate the proportion of mortality attributable to poverty on a national scale and to assess the extent to which this excess might be explained by major known risk factors.
  Several studies have focused on the association of socioeconomic position and mortality in the U.S. pop­ ulation. Pappas et a/13 compared U.S. mortality differen­ tials  by income  and education  with differentials reported
by Kitagawa  and  H auser11 two decades earlier;  they did

I) and its National Health Examination Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) to examine socioeconomic effects on mortality in the United States. Feldman et a/14 studied education as a relatively unchanging marker of adult socioeconomic position; they found little con­ founding by several behavioral risk factors but did not report the effect of adjustment for income or residence in a poverty area. Franks et a!11 found an effect of lack of health insurance on black and white mortality adjusted for initial health, employment status, income, educa­ tion, and several other behavioral and physical risk factors. Finally, Williams and Lepkows ki16 examined poverty as a risk factor for mortality, adjusted for health insurance status, medical care, and various physical and
behavioral risk factors; unlike Feldman et al14 and Franks et al,33 Williams and Lepkows ki36 used an analytical approach ( that is, logistic regression) that did not ac­ count for follow-up time. Although all of these studies demonstrate the effects of socioeconomic position on mortality, none estimates the proportion of U.S.  mor­ tality attributable to low socioeconomic position.
  We examined poverty as a risk factor for mortality in the NHANES I and NHEFS sample of the U.S. popu­ lation 25-74 years of age. We first assessed the overall association of poverty and mortality and determined whether this association differed by age, black and white race/ethnicity, and gender. On this  basis,  we  estimated the proportion of U.S. mortality attributable to poverty among black and white men and women during the 1971-1984 study period and in 1991. Finally, to deter­ mine the characteristics of poverty that contribute to its effect, we assessed behavioral and physical  risk factors that might either confound the association of  poverty and mortality or follow poverty and lead to mortality.

Methods
DAT A SOURCES
From 1971 through 1975, as a part of the NHANES I, a probability sample of 14,407 adults age 25-74 years from the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the
United States was interviewed and examined. 54·55 During
the initial survey period (1971-1974 ), persons from pov­ erty areas, persons of older ages, and women of child­ bearing ages were oversampled. During 1974-1975, an additional sample was drawn to increase the total sample size; this supplement was not oversampled.
  From 1981 through 1984, extensive efforts were made in the NHEFS to recontact, reinterview, and briefly
reexamine   the   NHANES    I  survey   population. 55   Fol­
low-up information was available for 13,318 (92.4%) of the original sample; of these initial respondents, 2,022 (15.2%) had died. Death certificates were acquired for 1,935 (95.7%) of decedents. Success in follow-up dif­ fered by several risk factors, but differed little by annual income ( that is, from 91% among persons with incomes
<$4,000    to    95%    among    persons    with  incomes
2 $10,000 ).55 The population analyzed here includes NHEFS subjects with known risk factor and follow-up status. Where information is available, risk factors ex-

amined in the study are those assessed at initial exami­ nation.55 When subjects were disabled or had died, prox­ ies provided follow-up information.
  We examined the following biological risk factors: serum total cholesterol level (2 200 mg per di), systolic blood pressure (2160 mmHg), and body mass index (231.1 for men and 232.3 for women); for women, we also examined natural or surgical menopause and ever­ use of replacement hormones. We examined the follow­ ing behavioral factors: smoking (current vs never or prior smoking), lack of physical activity at work or in recre­ ation, and daily alcohol consumption 21 ounce. In addition to income, we considered the following demo­ graphic and socioeconomic variables: age (25-44, 45- 64, and 65-74 years at initial interview),  black  and white race/ethnicity, marital status (married vs not mar­ ried), and education (> 12th grade vs :::::12th grade). Because only 172 NHANES I participants were neither black nor white and because only 19 of these persons had died, we restricted our analysis to blacks and whites ( that is, 98.7% of the follow-up cohort).
  For the purposes of this study, we refer to persons at or below the poverty level when first interviewed as "poor," and to persons living above this level as "nonpoor." NHANES I used the Bureau of the Census definition of poverty, which takes into account family size and mon­ etary inco me.56 Poverty threshold levels are adjusted annually using the Consumer Price Index. In 1973, the
poverty threshold for a family of four persons was $4,540; in 1991, the threshold was $13,924.

ANALYSIS
We used Cox proportional hazards methods to analyze the relative survival time for nonpoor vs poor persons, controlling for other variables. 57 We first assessed the proportional hazards assumption that underlies Cox pro­ portional hazards analysis by evaluating the parallelism of a natural logarithmic transformation of survival curves for poverty and for each study covariate, using the Lifetest Procedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version 6.07.58 We categorized continuous vari­ ables into two or three levels. We included variables that satisfied the proportional hazard assumption in subse­
quent models and stratified models by variables that did not satisfy the assumption.
  Next, we compared the hazard of dying among the poor with the hazard of dying among the nonpoor. We calculated hazard ratios 59 using the PROC PHREG pro­ cedure in SAS. To determine whether the association of poverty and mortality differed by age and black-white race/ethnicity, we compared survival models that in­ cluded both age-poverty and race/ethnicity-poverty in­ teraction terms with survival models without each of
these terms, one at a time. Comparison models also included terms for race/ethnicity, age, and  poverty alone, as well as all potential confounders (as listed above). We tested gender-poverty interaction sepa­ rately, excluding two reproductive variables relevant only to women, that is, hysterectomy and use of estrogen replacement hormones.

  Each model included only NHANES I subjects for whom information was available  on  all  risk  factors  in th at model. We used th e likelihood ratio  test  to assess the difference between models  including  and  excluding th e interact ion term s. T o determin e whether  the asso­  c iation between poverty and mort alit y might be due to illn ess in the stud y cohort a t th e outset of the stud y, we compared the analysis of all cohort sub jects with analysis of a cohort excludin g sub jects for the first two follo w-up years ( who were at increased risk of death due to recent illness).
  We then assessed the  mortality  and  mortality  rates attr ibu table to poverty [that is, the population attribut­ able risk (PAR)] for persons 25-74 years of  age  in  the Un it ed States. We applied relative hazards of mortality associated with poverty to estimates of the prevalence of poverty in the U.S. po pulatio n in 1973, the mid-year of the NHANES  l.60  We  calculated  attributable  mortality in persons 25-84 ye ars of age in 1982, the mid- ye ar of the follow-up period.61 We included deaths among per­ sons 25-84 years of age because  the  NHANES  cohort had aged by a mean of approxim ately 10 years durin g the study interval (1971- 1984), and  subjects  could  have died at any age between 25 and 88 years. We calculated poverty attributable mortality rates by dividing poverty attributable mortality (for exa mple, for black men 25- 74 years of age) by the populati on at risk. To calculate the population attributable risk estim ates, we used hazard ratios adjusted for age and race/ethnicity , but not for the other risk factors examined, because the other risk  fac­ tors were likely to be in termediate variables in the as­ sociatio n between poverty and mortality.
We calculated population attributable risk as follows:
L (P;) (RR, - 1)
PAR= 1 + L (P;) (RR;   -   1)'
wh ere P; is the population prevalence of a risk factor in stratum i (for example,  poverty  among  persons  25-44 yea rs of age) associat ed with an outcome of intere st (for example , all-cause mo rtalit y) , and RR; is the relative risk (o r hazard ratio) of the outc ome associated with expo­ sure to this risk fact or. Populatio n attributable risk  is thus a function of the prevalence of contribu ting expo­ sures and the risk for the outc ome associated with those exposures. The  magnitude  of the effect  of the exposure on the outcome (for example, the number of deaths) is estimated by multiplying the population attributable risk by the number of ou tcome events in the population.
  To determine the proportions of mortality attribut­ able to poverty in the United States more recen tly, we used estim ates of the prevalence of poverty in the United States in 1991.56 We calculated attributable mor­ tali ty among persons 25- 84 years of age in 1991, the most recent mortality data avail able. 62
  T o determine the behavioral and physical character­ istics of poverty that might cont ribute to its effect on mortality, we then assessed confounding by study risk factors in the NHANES I study period. We first exam­ ined the distribution of study risk factors among persons

who were poor and who were nonpoor. We then com­ pared survival models that included all potential con­ founders with models in which a single potential con­ founder was removed.63 If removal of the single potential confounder substantially altered the hazard ratio for pov­ erty, the confounder was retained in the model; other potent ial co nfounders were elimin ated. We arbitrarily considered a change in the haza rd rati o of 20% or more to be a substant ial change. We repeated this procedure until we had eliminated all nonconfounders in the stud y from the model. Because two study covariates (that is, hysterectomy and use of est rogen replacement hor­ mones) applied to women subject s only, we examined potent ial confounding separately for men and women.
  The software currently available to analyze the data from complex sample surveys (that is, SUDAAN) does not allow for variables that do not meet the proportional haza rds assumption . Because several variables in our analysis did not meet the proportional hazard s assump­ tio n, we were unable to use wei gh ted estimates or to take the study design into account . Nevertheless, we evalu­ ated the effect of not account in g for the study design and weights in our analysis. For models in which study vari­ ables did meet the proportional hazards assumption, we compared the analysis in SUDAAN that accounted for design with the unweigh ted analysis produced by SAS.

Results
NHA NES I provided follow-up information on  1,670 poor persons and 8,182 no npoor persons in the  cohort; 458 ( 27.4%) poor persons and 1,221 (14.9%) nonpoor persons had died durin g the follow-up interval. The median follow-up time was 9.9 years.  Fifty-two  per cent of decedents had died from cardiovascular diseases, 23 % from cancers, and 4% from in juries; the distribution of causes of death did not differ substantially by poverty status.

PROPORTI ON AL HA ZA RD A SSUMPTION
We confirmed the proportio n al hazards assumption for poverty and for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital sta­ tus, exercise, smoking, alcohol drinkin g, and hyperten­ sio n, but not for education, body mass index, serum total cholesterol, natural or surgical menopause, or use of estrogen replacement ho rmones. We thus included the former in subsequent mod els and the latter as stratifying variables. For models inco rporating variables that satis­ fied the proportional hazards assumption, comparison of analyses using SUDAAN and SAS indicated close ap­ proximation of most point estimates.

RA CE/E THNICITY, G EN DER, AND A GE INTERACTION IN THE A SSOCIATI ON OF POVERTY AND M ORT ALITY
The  effect of poverty on  mortality did not  differ substan­
tially for blacks and whites or males and females. The relative hazards effect of poverty on mortality did not differ importantly by age among women, but it did differ by age among men, declining from 3.0 among men 25-44 years of age, to  2.2 amorur   men aee 45-64 vears

MORTALITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO POVERTY
In 1973 in the United States, the mid-year of the NHANES I data collection period, 9.2% of black and white persons 25-74 years of age lived in poverty (Table 2). The prevalence of poverty differed greatly by gender and race/ethnicity; poverty was  lowest  among  white men, and increasingly  higher  among  white  women, black men, and black women  (Table  2). Thirty  per cent of black women age 25-75 years lived in poverty-a proportion 5.3 times that for white men.  Overall,  pov­ erty was twofold greater among persons 2'.:65 years of age than among persons 25-64 years of age.
  During 1973, 16.1% of all U.S. mortality (that is, 240,283 deaths) among black and white persons 25-84 years of age was attributable to poverty  (Table 3). Rates of death attributable to poverty  differed by race/ethnic­ ity and gender and were lowest  for white women, twice as high for white men, 2.8 times higher among black women, and 6.0 times higher for black men (Table 3). During 1991, the prevalence of poverty among black and white adults age 25-84 years was 10.3% (Table 2). The prevalence of poverty again differed substantially by race/ethnicity and gender (Table  2). Compared  with white men, the prevalence of poverty was 1.5  times higher among white women, 2.6 times higher among black men, and 4.4 times higher among black women.
There was no consistent association of age and the
prevalence of pover.t¥-
  
Overall, 17.7% of U.S. mortality among black and white men and women age 25-84 years during 1991 (that is, 278,914 deaths) was attributable to poverty (Table 3). White women had the lowest rate of mortal­ ity attributable to poverty; white men had a rate 2.5 times the rate of white women, black women 3.0 times, and black men 6.6 times.

CONFOUNDING IN THE A SSOCIA TION OF PO VERTY AND MORTALITY
Compared with nonpoor persons, poor persons were
more likely to be female, black, older, less educated, and unmarried (Table 4). Poor persons were more likely to have elevated blood pressure and not to be physically act ive, but less likely to drink alcohol heavily (Table 4). The prevalence of smoking and high levels of total cholesterol did not differ substantially between the poor and nonpoor subjects (Table 4). Poor women were less likely to have had a hysterectomy and only half as likely to have taken estrogen replacement hormones as non­ poor women (Table 4).
  Among men, controlling for all potential confounders reduced the hazard ratio (from a model including only poverty) by 3% for men age 25-44 years, 27% for men age 45-64 years, and 20% for men age 65-74 years (Table 1). Among women age 25-74 years, controlling for potential confounders redu ced the hazard ratio (from a model including only poverty) by 40%. No single

Discussion
During the early 1970s, 16.1% of U.S. mortality among black and white adults age 25- 74 years was attributable to poverty; in 1991, 17.7% of U.S. mortality among adults was attributable to poverty. Notably, in 1990, a comparable proportion of all deaths in the United States-approximately 20%-was attributable  to  ciga­ rette smoking, which has been targeted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as the lead­ ing cause of preventable death in the United States today.64
  Rates of mortality attributable to poverty were sub­ stantialiy higher for men than for women and for blacks than for whites; in 1991, rates ranged from a low of 90.9 per 100,000 for white women to a high of 602.9 for black men. Differences in attributable mortality rates reflect differences in the prevalence of poverty as well as dif­ ferences in mortality rates. Because poverty, as measured in this study, did not include  nonmonetary  "transfers" (for example, Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, or sub­ sidized housing), the effects of poverty can be assumed to occur despite these benefits.
  This analysis of a sample of black and white adults 25- 75 years of age in the United States indicates  that the association of poverty and death for women is asso­ ciated with the differential distribution of major risk factors for mortality assessed in NHANES I, but not by the distribution of any single risk factor. For men, the lack of confounding of the association by risk factors examined in this study implies that other consequences of poverty must be intermediate steps toward increased

erty and numerous behavioral and biological risk factors for mortality remains a critical area for investigation.
  When interpreting these results, several caveats must be kept in mind. First, socioeconomic position may be examined by diverse measures. 10 Poverty as assessed in NHANES I is a useful measure of socioeconomic posi­ tion because it takes into account not only family in­ come, but also living conditions such as household size and number of children $ I 8 years of age. Poverty was analyzed in this study because it captured basic not ions of inadequate resources and because it corresponded to available standard census information for both 1973 and 1991.
  Second, the measure of poverty was modified once between the time of its assessment in NHANES I and the more recent time period for which we estimated the population effect of poverty on mortality . The effect of these changes on the estimation of the prevalence of poverty in the population was small, adding 0.2% to the estimated 13.0% overall prevalence of poverty in the United States in 1980.65
  Third, although we designated persons who were clas­ sified as below the poverty threshold in 1973  as "poor" and those at or above the threshold as "nonpoor,"  pov­ erty and nonpoverty status are not fixed personal char­ acteristics. For example, from 1987 through 1988, 4.5 million nonpoor persons (2.2% of the nonpoor popula­ tion) became poor, and 6.4 million poor  persons  (25.7% of the poor population in 1987) became nonpoor.66 The transition into or out of poverty was associated with characteristics such as race/ethnicity,  age,  income,  type of residence, and work experience. Thus, it  was  likely that a substantial portion of persons classified as poor at their initial interview in NHANES I subsequently  be­ came nonpoor, and  vice  versa  (in  smaller  proportion, but larger numbers). An effect of poverty was demon­ strated in this study despite  possible  misclassification. It is possible that the effect of poverty on mortality ascer­ tained in this study was greater among persons who remained poor during the follow-up period than among those who became nonpoor; however, NHEFS  data  do not allow assessment of this hypothesis. In addition, including persons near the poverty  threshold  with  those at higher income levels is likely to yield a conservative estimate of the effect of poverty on mortality. The ab­ sence of historical data on poverty levels precluded the analysis of trend.
  Fourth, whereas we considered the effect of poverty during the early 1970s on mortality during the follow-up period in 1982, we examined the effect of poverty in 1991 on mortality in the same year. We used mortality in 1991 because it was the most recent information available. Because mortality rates have declined steadily over recent decades, it is likely that the mortality rates attributable to poverty in 1991 will be lower than our estimates and that the increase in attributable mortality since 1973 will similarly be smaller.
  Fifth, in comparing the population attributable risk of poverty on mortality for 1971-1984 with that for 1991, we assumed that the effect of poverty on mortality was

constant over this period. Several studies, however, have indicated that the disparity in mortality by socioeco­ nomic position (as measured by income and education) has increased in recent decades.13·14 Thus, our analysis probably underestimated the effect of poverty on mor­ tality in the more recent period and is likely to be a conservative estimate of the population attributable risk in 1991.
  Sixth, although we found a strong association of pov­ erty and all-cause mortality, our study did not allow determination of the causal pathway connecting poverty and death. It is possible that morbidity before the NHANES I may have led both to poverty and to sub­ sequent mortality. The relative importance of this hy­ pothesis depends on the proportion of mobility between upper and lower socioec onomic classes and on the pro­ portion of mobility caused by health status. Evidence from other studies indicates that although "downward social mobility" associated with poor health does occur,67 poor health contributes relatively little to poverty; the direction of causation is primarily from poverty to poor health to mortality.6-8 70 Moreover, in the NHANES I cohort, poverty was assessed a mean of 10 years before the follow-up survey, and it was thus less likely that illness ultimately resulting in death contributed to pov­ erty rather than the reverse situation. Our finding of little difference in analytical results excluding study sub­ jects followed up within 2 years indicates little effect of early sickness on the association of poverty and mortal­ ity.
  Seventh, we were unable to consider risk factors not assessed in NHEFS (for example, environmental expo­ sures). These factors may partially explain the associa­ tion of poverty and mortality. Although overall utiliza­ tion of health care was not assessed in NHANES I and NHEFS, there is evidence that utilization differs sub­ stantially by poverty status. Compared with nonpoor persons in the NHANES I cohort in 1973, persons living in poverty were 2.1 times more likely to report never having had a medical check-up. A recent study of the NHANES I cohort found that, independent of income, an excess mortality of 25% occurred among persons without private insurance in comparison with persons who had private insurance, indicating that this barrier to health care effects a substantial increase in mortality.33 Eighth, we examined mortality only among persons 25-75 years of age. In 1991, persons 2:25 years of age constituted 65.0% of the U.S. population but included only 48.3% of persons below the poverty level.56 Nev­ ertheless, deaths among persons 25-75 years of age ac­ counted for 2:95% of mortality in the United States; thus, even if lower income fully explained mortality among younger persons, it would account for less than 5% of overall U.S. morta lity. Because younger persons commonly die at different rates, from different causes, and in association with different risk factors, the effect of poverty on the mortality of the younger population is likely to differ substantially from that found in this study;
it merits separate study.

  In summary, although the NHANES  1  and  the NHEFS did not allow detailed analysis of the relations among poverty and diverse risk factors for mortality and their changes over time, they did provide a useful esti­ mate of the overall effect of poverty on mortality in the United States. Moreover,  they  allowed  us  to  examine the association of poverty and numerous observer-mea­ sured and self-reported risk factors and to consider  the role of risk factors-some of which had not been  exam­ ined previously-as confounders of the association be­ tween poverty and mortality.
