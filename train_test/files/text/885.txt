This article estimates the effects of various parent and child characteristics on the choice of
care arrangement of the parent, taking into account the potential endogeneity of some of the
child characteristics. Three equations are estimated: a care choice equation, a child location
equation, and a child work equation. Results suggest a hierarchy of family decision making;
child locations affect the care decision, which affects child work decisions. The results also
question previous research attempting to explain causes of secular trends in long-term care.

Adjustments to Parents' Long-Term
Care Needs1
Steven Stern, PhD2
Much work has been published on how families
make adjustments so that elderly parents can receive
long-term care. In particular, researchers such as
Ikels (1983) suggest that increased geographic dis-
tance between the parent and adult child reduces the
probability of the child caring for the parent, and
investigators such as Wolf and Soldo (1988) suggest
that labor force participation of the child reduces the
probability of the child caring for the parent. How-
ever, Cantor (1983) and Stone and Short (1990),
among others, suggest that the causation runs the
other way. These authors are inferring causation
from what is essentially a correlation. A few research-
ers measure causation controlling for variation in
other explanatory factors (Cutler & Sheiner, 1993;
Kotlikoff & Morris, 1988; Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990;
Wolf & Soldo, 1991), but none seriously deal with
causation potentially working in both directions.
Cutler and Sheiner (1993) are concerned about the
issue when choosing policy measures, and Soldo et
al. (1990) worry about it when defining care alterna-
tives. But neither uses an estimation method to con-
trol for the problem. Boaz and Muller (1992) condi-
tion on positive hours of caregiving and then find
small effects both ways.
Theory suggests that causation can run either or
both ways. It is reasonable to assume that children
far away are not well suited to provide care, and that
working children have other serious demands upon
their time. It also is reasonable to assume that a child
(or a parent) will move closer to facilitate caregiving

or that a child will reduce work hours to provide
better care. Whether these arguments are true is an
empirical question and one that cannot be answered
by measuring one or two correlations.
This study applies nonlinear estimation techniques
developed to look at the causation question for these
data in Stern (1995). It uses a sample of families from
the National Long-Term Care Survey. The model
estimates imply that there is a particular hierarchy of
causation. First, children choose where to live inde-
pendent of parent long-term care needs. Then, once
the parent requires care, the family decides who
should provide care while taking into account the
distance between the parent and each child (along
with other relevant criteria). Finally, the child who
provides care decides whether to continue working,
taking into account his or her care responsibilities.
The next sections of this article describe the data to
be used, the model and estimation procedure; and
provide estimates and simulation results based on
those estimates.
The Data
The data are from the National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS), a sample of families with a parent at
least 65 years old with an activity of daily living (ADL)
problem or instrumental activity of daily living (IADL)
problem lasting at least three months (Macken,
1986). Elderly people who passed a series of screen-
ing questions were surveyed in 1982 about their
living arrangements and reinterviewed in 1984.
(There is another wave of the NLTCS in 1989 not used
in this study.) From an original sample of 25,401,
19,205 observations were rejected because they
failed the 1982 screening test (and thus were not
asked any of the relevant questions), and 1,306 ob-
servations were rejected because they did not an-
swer the 1984 questions. Another 801 observations
76 The Gerontologist
were lost because of missing information on sex,
race, age, or education of the parent (with no reason-
able way to impute the missing value), and 642 were
lost because of missing information on the number
of children. This left 3,447 parents for whom there
was information on all of the essential variables or for
whom there was enough to confidently impute the
missing variable values.
Many of the same imputation techniques of Wolf
and Soldo (1991) are used here, although others are
added to avoid missing value problems. For exam-
ple, if the parent's observed sex is different in the
two years but a spouse's sex is constant, the parent's
sex is adjusted, assuming a traditional marriage. Ad-
justments are made to the parents' and children's
ages to make them consistent with the passage of
time. Finally, children's sex is adjusted so that sex
distribution within a family is consistent over time
(e.g., it is impossible to add sons or daughters).
The means and standard deviations of important
variables for parents are listed in Table 1. The sample
ranges in age from 63 to 101 with a mean age of 76.
About two-thirds of the sample is female, 56% have
no spouse, and people have a high number of prob-
lems with ADLs and other functional limitations
(OFLs) relative to the United States population of the
same age (because of the NLTCS screening rules).
OFL variables are IADL problems and other func-
tional limitations. ADL and OFL variables are listed in
Appendix A. No one lives in a nursing home in 1982
because of the NLTCS sampling procedure. Some of
the estimation procedures used in this study restrict
the sample to those who receive no significant help
from children in 1982. For those procedures, the
sample size is 2,238.
The key variable in this analysis is the care provi-
sion for the parent. The parent is asked to list each
child (either at home or away from home) and
whether he or she provides help. If only one child is
listed as providing help, that child is designated the
primary caregiver. If more than one child is listed, a
tie-breaking rule (with hours of care provision as its

dominant criterion) is used to designate a primary
caregiver in the data. Even if the spouse provides
more care than any of the children, the child provid-
ing the most care is labeled the primary care pro-
vider. This is done because the purpose of the re-
search is to identify factors determining care choices
outside the home. If no child is listed, then the
parent is designated as "living alone." The parent is
considered to be "living alone" even if a spouse,
sibling, friend, or paid care provider is present. The
parent's "living alone" category is aggregated by
marital status because it is improper to define alter-
natives for the endogenous variable in terms of an
exogenous variable. The other categories (care from
sibling, friend, or paid care provider) are aggregated
into this group because (a) there are not enough
observations for each separate category, and (b) it is
not observed whether each category is an available
option (e.g., there is no information in the data about
siblings of the parent). If the parent lives in a nursing
home, then the nursing home is the primary care-
giver. The proportion of parents receiving help from
achild is much lower in this study than in other work,
such as Wolf and Soldo (1991), because married and
unmarried parents of both sexes and people in nurs-
ing homes are included here.
The NLTCS includes an income variable for each
parent but it is not used because (a) it is missing for
529 people, and (b) it is bracketed and imprecise for
all people, especially those living with children or in
a nursing home. A continuous measure of income
was experimented with for all observations using the
technology in Stern (1991). However, there were
clear signs of unspecified nonlinearities and selec-
tion bias, and thus it was not used.
The mean number of children is 2.21 in 1982 and
2.07 in 1984. The means and standard deviations of
child characteristics are presented in Table 2. Obvi-
ously, there is something wrong with the reporting
of number of grandchildren in 1984. Thus, the 1982
numbers are treated as a proxy for the unreported,
correct 1984 numbers. Also, the number of living
children reported declines too much between 1982
and 1984 (from 2.21 to 2.07) to be consistent with
national data (Table 1). Part of this decline is due to
mortality. But part of it is due to parents losing
contact with some of their children. This loss of

children is an especially serious empirical problem
for those in nursing homes, where survey questions
are frequently answered by a proxy who may not
know of the existence of children never seen. On the
other hand, the NLTCS is the only large data set with
sufficient information to address long-term care is-
sues in a family context. The data set used by Kotli-
koff and Morris (1988), for example, is much smaller
and somewhat specialized, while other data sets do
not include sufficient information about all of the
children in the family.
The estimation procedure relies on transitions of
the parent and child explanatory variables over time.
In particular, the primary estimation method condi-
tions on the parent living alone in 1982 and then uses
transitions between 1982 and 1984 in explanatory
variables to explain transitions from living alone to
other care alternatives. In fact, conditional on living
alone in 1982, there are 178 changes in marital status,
3,049 changes in existence of different ADL prob-
lems, 14,192 changes in existence of different OFL
problems, and 1,341 changes in child or parent resi-
dence observed in the data. Thus, there is certainly
sufficient variation in the data to estimate the models
to be described. The other estimation methods do
not condition on living alone in 1982 and thus use
variation across both time and families to explain
variation in care alternatives.
Estimation Methodology
This section describes the model's equations (and
parameters) to be estimated and provides the reader
with intuition about the estimation procedure. The
reader interested in the details of the estimation
procedure may request that Appendix from the au-
thor or read Stern (1995).
The model is described by three equations. The
first determines the value to a family of using a partic-
ular long-term care arrangement; the second deter-
mines the value of each child in the sample working;
and the third determines where a child decides to live
relative to the parent. It is assumed that long-term
care alternatives are (a) to have each child alive at t
care for the parent; (b) have the parent live alone
without any care from a child; or (c) have the parent
live in a nursing home. In many families there are
multiple caregivers, but almost always one child as-
sumes the role of primary caregiver (Cantor, 1983).
Thus, in a family with N children, there are N + 2 care
alternatives. For this study I assume that a family
makes the decision that maximizes the sum of utilities
to all family members. Engers and Stern (1995) and
Heidemann and Stern (1995) construct family
decision-making models where there are important
differences in the interests of different family mem-
bers and where family members act strategically.
While the estimation results are different, most of the
results are qualitatively similar. Let yj be the value to
family i of choosing the jth care alternative at time t for
t = 1982 or 1984. Assume that yj depends upon the
work status of child j, the distance between child j and
the parent, other observed explanatory variables, and
some unobserved explanatory variables.
The variable y,* is not observed. Instead, yijt
is
observed which is equal to 1 if and only if family i
chooses choice j at time t. It is assumed that yijt
= 1 if
and only if y,* > yj, for all k =
£ j ; i.e., that the care
alternative chosen is the one that maximizes the
value to the family of providing care.
The second equation determines the value of
working for child j of family i at time t. Assume the
value of working (relative to not working) depends
upon the lagged value of working, the care responsi-
bilities of child j , other observed explanatory vari-
ables, and some unobserved variables. As was true
for the value of providing care, the value of working
is not observed; instead, whether child j works is
observed.
The last equation determines the distance be-
tween child j and the parent. Assume the distance
depends upon lagged distance, the care responsibili-
ties of child j, other observed explanatory variables,
and other unobserved variables. Again, distance is
not observed. Instead, the range that distance falls in
(where ranges are defined in the note to Table 2) is
observed.
All three estimation problems are polychotomous
discrete choice estimation problems. The exact
method of estimation depends upon, among other
things, the distributions of the errors in each equa-
tion. For specific assumptions about the error distri-
butions, estimation of the care equation requires
multinomial logit or multinomial probit; estimation of
the work equation requires probit or logit; and esti-
mation of the distance equation requires ordered
probit or ordered logit (Maddala, 1985). For the care
equation, the number of choices available for each
family varies over families; it is N + 2 when there are N
children. There is no problem caused by having fami-
lies of different size or children with different charac-
teristics within a family. For the work equation, the
number of choices is two: work or not. For the dis-
tance equation, the number of choices is six. For each
method, the objective is to minimize a weighted sum
of squared residuals where there is one residual for
each choice available. I assume errors for the care
equation are extreme value (leading to a multinomial
logit type model), and errors in the work and distance
equation are normally distributed (leading to a probit
and ordered probit type model, respectively).
Results, once properly interpreted, are not sensitive
to error distribution assumptions.
A problem that must be addressed for all three
equations is that one of the explanatory variables for
each equation is the dependent variable for one of
the other equations. This causes the explanatory vari-
ables to be endogenous; it is correlated with the error
in the equation. One must either estimate all three
equations simultaneously, using a method like full
information maximum likelihood estimation, or esti-
mate each separately, controlling for the endogeneity
of some of the explanatory variables. The second
approach, used in this research, can be implemented
using nonlinear instrumental variables estimation.
Two steps are involved in using instrumental vari-
ables. The first is to find other variables, called instru-
78 The Gerontologist
ments, for each equation that are uncorrelated with
the error of that equation but are correlated with the
dependent variable and the explanatory variables. In
this particular application, good instruments for 1984
endogenous explanatory variables are 1982 values of
those variables. These instruments have the desired
properties as long as only the families where the
parent lived alone in 1982 are used. If only such
families are used, then there is no variation in the
care provision variable for 1982, and so the explana-
tory variable cannot be correlated with it. Stern
(1994,1995) identifies other possible sources of bias
and shows empirically which ones are important. In
particular, Stern (1995) suggests that there may be
important differences in transitions between the in-
cluded and excluded data, while Engers and Stern
(1995), using a different model, suggest that no im-
portant biases exist. If such bias did exist, it would
suggest that care transition probabilities depend
upon the care alternative being used before the
potential transition. The second step is to use a
generalization of ordinary least squares using the
instruments to estimate the parameters. For this ap-
plication, the instrumental variables estimation pro-
cedure provides estimates of the parameters with
insignificant asymptotic bias even when there are
endogenous explanatory variables. The interested
reader should see Stern (1994,1995) for more details
specific to this application.
It may be that the potentially endogenous explana-
tory variable in any particular equation is actually
exogenous (uncorrelated with the error). For exam-
ple, if the value of working for child j does not
depend upon her care responsibilities and the errors
in the care and work equations are independent,
then work status in the care equation is actually
exogenous. One can test whether any of the explana-
tory variables are endogenous using a test statistic
described in Hausman (1978). This essentially in-
volves measuring the significance of the difference
between coefficient estimates when endogeneity is
controlled for and coefficient estimates when it is not
controlled for.
Estimation Results
Before discussing estimates from particular proce-
dures, I need to specify what variables belong in each
equation. The value of living alone depends upon a
constant, gender, age, education, marital status,
race, six ADL problems, and 21 OFL problems (de-
fined in Appendix A). The value of living in a nursing
home depends upon a constant, gender, age, educa-
tion, marital status, and race. The value of receiving
care from a particular child depends upon the child's
gender, age, marital status, distance from the parent,
labor force participation, labor force participation of
the child's spouse, and number of children of the
child (grandchildren). There are also dummies for
whether the child is either the oldest male or oldest
female child. The motivation for this specification is
that the parent tries to remain independent as long as
possible. Once he or she requires help, possibly
because of an ADL or OFL problem, the characteris-
tics of the children and the other characteristics of
the parent determine whether the parent receives
care and from whom.
Results of the instrumental variables estimation of
the care equation are reported in Table 3. The inter-
pretation of a coefficient estimate is the effect of that
variable on the value of using a particular care alter-
native. For example, the A-FEMALE coefficient esti-
mate is -.443. This means that the value of living at
home is -.443 less for elderly women than it is for
elderly men. It is assumed that the distribution of
errors is extreme value with a standard deviation of
u//6 = 1.283. Thus, .443 represents .433/1.283 =
.345 standard deviations of the error. Similarly, the
coefficient on N-BLACK means that the value of living
in a nursing home is -.476 less for blacks than for
whites, and the coefficient on C-DIST = 1 means that
the value of being cared for by a child in distance
range 1 (1 to 10 minutes away) is 1.155 less than the
value of having a child live in the parent's home.

To save space, no estimates are reported for ADL
or OFL variables. However, they are jointly signifi-
cant (the ADL significance level is .01, and the OFL
significance level is <.0001). One can test whether
the ADL (or OFL) variables are all of the correct sign
(negative) using a test statistic described in Kodde
and Palm (1986). The significance level of the Kodde-
Palm test statistic for the ADL coefficients is .037, and
for the OFL coefficient it is .074, suggesting reason-
able support for all ADL and OFL variables having the
correct sign.
Most of the estimates for other variables are con-
sistent with previous work. In particular, being fe-
male, older, single, or white reduces a parent's
chances of living alone, and being male, married, or
living far away reduces a child's chances of providing
care. One result worth noting is the negative (though
insignificant) coefficient estimates on the oldest
child dummies. This directly contradicts common
belief but is consistent with Horowitz (1982) and the
empirical results of Treas, Gronvold, and Bengtson
(1980). It is also worth noting the small and insignifi-
cant effects of education on care choices. Since an
income measure is missing, one would expect the
education variable to capture omitted income ef-
fects. This suggests that parent income is not a strong
predictor of care alternatives. Both child income and
child education are not available, so I can say nothing
about the effect of child income on care alternatives.
The key results are that the distance coefficients,
C-DIST = 1 through C-DIST = 5, are significant and
consistent with previous theory, but the work status of

the child, C-WORK, is not significant. If one does not
control for the endogeneity of these explanatory
variables, the coefficient on the child work status
becomes statistically significant (Stern, 1995, Table 4,
Column 1). Thus, it is important to control for the
endogeneity of explanatory variables if one wants to
draw proper causation conclusions. However, the
Hausman test statistic for this equation is insignifi-
cant. Interpretation of this result is delayed until the
end of the section.
Table 4 reports results of the instrumental variables
estimation of the distance equation. The explanatory
variables included in the equation are previous dis-
tance, care variables, and changes in marital status.
With the exception of the threshold variables, C2
through C5, these estimates are the effect of each
explanatory variable on the unobserved (possibly
nonlinear) measure of distance. This unobserved
measure of distance gets translated into the observed
bracketed distance measures by determining which
threshold variables the unobserved measure is be-
tween. For example, if the unobserved measure is
between C2 (= 1.986) and C3 (= 3.090), then actual
predicted distance is in range 2 (11-30 minutes).
Thus, for example, the effect on 1984 unobserved
location of living in range 4 in 1982 is 4.038 (relative to
living in range 0 in 1982). Given the threshold values,
CO through C6, this has a large effect on location in
1984. While previous location and getting married
have significant effects (with predicted directions) on
present location, becoming the primary caregiver or
getting divorced do not have significant effects. Actu-
ally, even if the endogeneity of care is not controlled
for, the coefficients on the care variables are insignifi-
cant. Also, the Hausman test statistic is insignificant.
Table 5 reports results for work status of the child.
These estimates should be interpreted as the effect
of each explanatory variable on the value of working.
For example, providing care reduces the value of
working by 1.009. The error in the equation is a
standard normal, implying that providing care re-

80 The Gerontologist
duces the value of working by 1.009 standard devia-
tions of the error. Results indicate that previous work
status and care provision significantly affect present
work status. In some preliminary regressions, other
variables such as changes in marital status and mari-
tal status interacted with work were found to be
insignificant. Again, the Hausman test statistic is in-
significant.
The results of Tables 3,4, and 5 suggest a hierarchy
of decisions. First, each child decides where to live.
Second, conditional on location but independent of
child work status, a care arrangement is determined.
Finally, the child decides whether to adjust his or her
work schedule. The Hausman test statistics are all
insignificant, suggesting it is not important to control
for endogeneity. However, there is some consensus
that Hausman test statistics have low power. Also, in
this case, based on Stern (1995), different conclu-
sions would have been drawn if potential endoge-
neity had not been controlled for.
Boaz and Muller (1992) use a continuous measure
of caregiving hours and a discrete measure of work
hours conditional on positive caregiving hours. They
then use a two-stage least squares estimator to mea-
sure the effect of work hours and caregiving hours
on each other. They find that work hours have small
effects on caregiving hours, but caregiving hours
have significant effects on reducing work hours from
full- to part-time work, and no significant effect on
reducing part-time hours to no work. Translating
into the discrete activity variables of this model im-
plies that neither activity has a significant effect on
the other. Other studies, such as Spitze and Logan
(1991), find similar results. The results in Boaz and
Muller (1992) differ from mine because (a) they use a
continuous measure of hours, (b) they control for
more caregiver characteristics, (c) they do not con-
trol for any characteristics of other potential care-
givers, and (d) they do not control for the selection
condition of positive caregiving hours.
A reader unfamiliar with polychotomous discrete,
ordered discrete, and binary discrete parameter esti-
mates may have a difficult time interpreting the
results in Tables 3, 4, and 5. An alternative way to
report results shows how choice probabilities
change with explanatory variable changes. Table 6
reports the probabilities of each potential caregiver
providing care for a set of representative families.
These numbers are based on the coefficient esti-
mates in Tables 3 and 5. The coefficient on work in
the care equation is set to zero. This is done because
(a) it is insignificant and (b) if it is not zero, then
Heckman (1978) shows that the model is not logically
consistent. The base case consists of a 76-year-old,
single white woman with 9 years of education and no
ADL problems, no OFL problems, and two children
both living 31 to 60 minutes away from her. The first
child is a 50-year-old married woman with no job, no
children, and a working spouse. The second is a 44-
year-old married man with a job, no children, and a
nonworking spouse. In this family, the parent has an
88% chance of living alone, a 7% chance of living with
her daughter, and a 4% chance of living with her son.
If the parent were male, he would have a 92% chance
of living alone. As the parent ages, she is less likely to
live alone. If she is married, she has a 97% chance of
receiving no care from children. ADL problems re-
duce her chances of living alone in 5 out of 6 cases.
As the daughter moves further away from the parent,
her chances of caring for the parent change from 34%
(when living with the parent) to .05% (when living
more than 1 day away). There are similar results for
the son. Finally, the effect of adding a third child
qualitatively similar to the son is to reduce all re-
ported probabilities by a factor of 1.0432 (1 + the
probability of child 2 caring for the parent).
The second half of Table 6 reports the probability of
each child working conditional on whether that child

has a large effect on labor force participation.
Simulation and Policy Experiments
Over the last generation, there has been a trend
away from having children of an elderly parent care
for the elderly parent to having the elderly parent live
alone or live in an institution such as a nursing home.
Kotlikoff and Morris (1988) report the following sta-
tistics: Since 1940, the proportion of unmarried,
noninstitutionalized elderly living alone has in-
creased from less than 25% to over 60%. For those
over 85 years old, the proportion has increased from
13% to 57%. The proportion of those over 85 living in
institutions has increased from 7% in 1940 to 25% in
the late 1980s. See, also, Boersch-Supan, Kotlikoff,
and Morris (1988) or Wolf and Soldo (1988) for evi-
dence on long-term trends. There are significant
social and financial implications associated with this
trend. Thus, it is worthwhile to understand how
family decisions are made concerning care for an
elderly parent.
Other researchers in this area have suggested
various reasons why care received from children has
declined over the last few decades. For example,
Treas (1977) argues that declining fertility rates have
affected care provision and suggests (Treas, 1981)
that increasing labor force participation rates of
women have had the same effect. Crimmins and
Ingegneri (1990) attribute the change to child migra-
tion patterns.
Using the parameter estimates in Table 3, one can
simulate the effects of various exogenous changes in
the environment families live in on care provision
choices they make. First, a baseline sample of one
million 1982 families, each with an elderly parent, is
simulated. Details of that process are described in
Appendix B. Characteristics of the sample in 1984 are
presented in Table 7. Care provision choices are
grouped into four categories: living alone with a
spouse, living alone without a spouse, living in a
nursing home, and receiving significant care from
children. This sample looks similar to the NLTCS
sample except that (a) parents have fewer ADLs (be-
cause having an ADL is a selection condition for the
NLTCS), and (b) living by oneself or with a spouse is
more prevalent (because there are fewer ADLs).
The care probabilities presented in Table 7 repre-
sent 2-year transition probabilities conditional on
living alone in the initial period. Consider a repre-

The Gerontologist
sentative cohort of 70-year-old people living alone
and let their families make decisions consistent with
the model estimated here once every 2 years about
their care arrangement. The paths followed by this
cohort over the next 14 years are graphed in Figures 1
and 2 using the transition probabilities implied by the
parameter estimates. One can see that, as the cohort
ages, living alone becomes less attractive and living
with children or in a nursing home becomes more
attractive. This is true for both women (Figure 1) and
men (Figure 2).
In the first experiment, the one-year death proba-
bilities are cut in half. This is done without changing
the joint density of sex, age, race, and marital status
in 1982. Thus, the change does not reflect the shifting
of the elderly age distribution toward older ages.
However, it does reflect children living longer. The
effects of this change on 2-year transition probabili-
ties, presented in Table 8, are to increase the proba-
bility of one's spouse surviving from 1982 to 1984.
There is also a small increase in children providing
care mainly because more children are available. The
change in the elderly age distribution, not captured
here, can be measured by observing the changes in
care provision choices across different age groups.
In particular, in Table 7, it is clear that, as parents age,
they are more likely to receive care from children,
live in nursing homes, and live alone without a
spouse. These changes occur because older parents
are less likely to have a spouse and because they are
more likely to have ADL and OFL deficiencies. Other
research, such as Rivlin and Wiener (1988), predicts
significant trends in long-term care based only on
changing age and implied ADL distribution. How-

Note: Death probabilities are reduced 50% (conditional on the original 1982 joint density of age, sex, and race). This increases the
average age of the parent by .03, the average age of the children by .07, and the number of living children by .01. Of the one million
families simulated in 1982, 920,933 elderly family members survived to 1984.

ever, they can not explain large changes in care
decisions controlling for age.
The second experiment reduces family size by .54
children. Results are reported in Table 9. This experi-
ment is referred to below as reducing children (RC).
The effect is that care provision by children declines
because there are fewer children but again by small
amounts. This is consistent with results in Marcil-
Cratton and Legare (1992).
The third and fourth experiment alters the distri-
bution of distances between the parent and children.
First, I shift the distribution so that, of the 34% of
children living one hour to one day away from the
parent (C-Dist = 4), 10% move more than one day
away (C-Dist = 5). This experiment is referred to
below as increasing intermediate distances (IID).
This change has very little effect on care provision
because children with C-Dist = 4 were unlikely to
provide care anyway. Next, I shift the baseline dis-
tance distribution so that children living less than 10
minutes from the parent (C-Dist = 0 or C-Dist = 1)
move to intermediate distances (C-Dist = 2 or C-Dist
= 3). This experiment is referred to below as increas-
ing short distances (ISD). Results are presented in
Table 10 for the specific change described in the
Notes. This change makes care provision by children
less likely but only by small amounts.
The long-term effects of the experiments de-
scribed above on the probability of receiving care by
a child for the cohort of 70-year-old women living
alone are graphed in Figure 3. The baseline probabil-
ity curve (BL) is identical to the "Children" curve in
Figure 1. Changing death probabilities has a negligi-
ble effect on the cohort. Reducing the number of
children (RC) has moderate effects on the order of
7% by the time the cohort is 84 years old. Increasing

intermediate distances (IID) and increasing short dis-
tances (ISD) both have relatively small effects on
long-term probabilities. The analogous curves for
men look very similar (not shown). Effects on long-
term probabilities of living alone (with and without a
spouse) are graphed in Figure 4. The only experi-
ments with any nonnegligible effects are reducing
the number of children (RC) and increasing short
distances (ISD). Reducing the number of children
increases the probability of living alone by only
about 5% even at age 84. It also increases the proba-
bility of living in a nursing home by about 1.5%.
These are small changes relative to those seen in the
United States over the last few decades.
Increasing divorce rates should not explain the
secular trend in that the coefficient on C-Marry in
Table 3 is negative (and insignificant). Increasing
labor force participation rates should not explain
the trend in that the coefficients on work, C-Work,
and C-SPWork are insignificant, small, and of oppo-
site signs.
Other possibilities which I have not been able to
measure because of lack of data include income
effects and changing social norms. In particular, ris-
ing incomes of elderly people may cause them to
spend resources on maintaining their indepen-
dence. However, this does not explain why 7% of
those over 85 lived in nursing homes in 1940 and 25%
lived in nursing homes in 1988, nor is it consistent
with the small coefficients on education variables.
Another possibility is changes in Medicaid eligibility
rules. However, this would not explain movements
between care by children and living alone. Possibly,
it just has become more socially acceptable for chil-
dren to not care for their elderly parents.
Conclusions
Once endogeneity of explanatory variables is con-
trolled for, a relatively clear picture emerges of how
families make decisions concerning long-term care
of elderly parents. First, each child decides where to
live independent of future long-term care responsi-
bilities. Next, once the parent requires care, the
family decides how to provide care while taking into
Figure 4. Experiments for 70-year-old women living alone; living
alone probabilities.
account the location of each family member but
essentially ignoring work responsibilities of chil-
dren. Then, the chosen primary caregiver decides
whether to reduce work hours, taking into account
her care responsibilities.
Four demographic trends have been used to ex-
plain the increasing incidence of parents living at
home: (a) increasing income of elderly people, (b)
greater geographic dispersion of families, (c) smaller
family size, and (d) greater labor force participation
rates of middle-aged women. This study has little to
say about the effect of increasing income. It suggests
that greater geographic dispersion of families and
smaller family sizes have helped increase the inci-
dence of elderly people living at home but cannot
explain the size of the trend. It also suggests that,
rather than the increasing labor force participation of
middle-aged women increasing the incidence of el-
derly people living alone, the incidence of elderly
people living alone increases the labor force partici-
pation rate of middle-aged women. As care responsi-
bilities of children have decreased (because of other
reasons), women and men have been able to work
more. Whether one thinks these trends are good or
bad depends upon one's opinions about work and all
of the long-term care alternatives available to families.

ADLs and Other Functional Limitations (OFLs)
ADL variables: Problem getting out of bed, problem
bathing, problem dressing, problem eating, problem us-
ing toilet, and problem walking inside.
OFL variables: Problems with: combing hair, cooking,
fatigue, fingers to grasp, hearing or understanding, doing
heavy work, doing laundry, doing light work, taking medi-
cine, handling money, reading newspapers, using tele-
phones, reaching above head, shopping, putting on socks,
speech, climbing stairs, transportation, lifting 10 pounds,
washing hair, and walking outside.
OFL variables are not available in the data for people in
nursing homes in 1984. OFLs are assumed to be a problem
for 1984 nursing home residents. This might cause a bias,
but there is no better alternative. No significant differ-
ences occur in other coefficient estimates if the OFL vari-
ables are not included as regressors.
Appendix B
Simulation
The goal is to simulate a sample of families with an
elderly parent in 1982 and then let it change stochastically
over the next two years. First, I construct the joint density
of the 1982 family characteristics. The joint density of age,
sex, and race (black or white) comes from U.S. Department
of Commerce (1989). The age of the parent is between 70
and 97, inclusive. The density of marital status (married or
not) conditional on age, sex, and race for 30 =s age =s 85
comes from U.S. Department of Commerce (1992). Data
are reported for 5-year age intervals and extrapolated for
later ages. The joint density of each ADL conditional on
age, sex, race, and marital status is modeled as a probit
depending on a constant, sex, race, marital status, and a
quadratic polynomial in age. The coefficients of the probit
index are estimated using data from the 1979 National
Health Interview Survey. The characteristics of these data
are described in Stern (1989). Each IADL is treated as a
Bernoulli random variable where the Bernoulli probabili-
ties are the sample means in the 1982 data used in this
article. While this may appear to be biased, there is no
alternative source of data to use, and the lADLs are not as
important in explaining behavior as are the ADLs. The
density of education conditional on age, sex, and race
comes from Kominski (1987).
The density of number of children conditional on age,
race, and marital status is derived by using Series B 42-48
from the U.S. Department of Commerce (1975,1992). The
Department of Commerce (1992) data are used to deter-
mine the probability of an unmarried person having ever
been married. The Department of Commerce (1975) data
report the density of number of children conditional on
having ever been married. The numbers are reported as 0
children, 1-2 children, 3-4 children, 5-6 children, and 7 or
more children. The numbers are restricted to be between 0
and 6, and then they are extrapolated using the informa-
tion in the table using a quadratic polynomial spline for 0
to 4 children and a constant splitting rule for 5 and 6
children. The ages of the children are simulated condi-
tional on number of children n, by drawing n, random
numbers between 20 and 35 (the age of the mother at
birth), adjusting them so that they are all at least 1.25 years
apart, and then subtracting them from the parent's age in
1982. As with the lADLs, there is no available data on child
spacing with enough detail for the relevant years of family
building. Child sex is modeled as a Bernoulli (.5) random
variable. Each child is subjected to a mortality probability
(from birth until age in 1982) conditional on age, sex, and
race data taken from U.S. Department of Health and Hu-
man Services (1991). The density of working status condi-
tional on age, sex, and race comes from U.S. Department
of Labor (1985). The density of distance between the parent
and each child comes from the 1982 empirical density of
that variable from the data used in this article. Again, there
is no better source. However, it predicts the distribution of
the distance of the closest child in 1984 very well using
Crimmins and Ingegneri (1990), Table 2 as a reference.
The transitions between 1982 and 1984 are then con-
structed. Sex, race, education, and child distance are
86 The Gerontologist
fixed, and age increases by 2. All family members and
spouses of family members are subjected to 2-year mortal-
ity probabilities conditional on age, sex, and race. It is
assumed that no divorce occurs. ADL transition probabili-
ties are constructed assuming that having an ADL is an
absorbing state and then using the probit coefficients to
construct transition probabilities conditional on age, sex,
race, and marital status:
Pr(84|82) = [Pr(84) - Pr(82)]/[1 - Pr(82)] (B.1)
where Pr(t) = probability of having a particular ADL in year
t. It is assumed that work statuses of children and chil-
dren's spouses are independent over time.
One must make some extra assumptions about some
transition probabilities in order to generate the curves in
Figures 1-4. They are (a) nursing home is an absorbing
state while alive (probability of leaving a nursing home is
zero); (b) Pr[live alone at t + 2|live with child at t] = .05; and
(c) Pr[live in nursing home at t + 2|live with child at t] = .02.
The estimation procedure provides no information about
these transition probabilities because they condition on a
care arrangement other than living alone.
The joint density described above is used to simulate a
population of one million families. Changes in the density
parameters represent policy experiments. For example, in
Tables 8 and 9, I reduce mortality probabilities by 50% and
shift the number of children density to the left.
