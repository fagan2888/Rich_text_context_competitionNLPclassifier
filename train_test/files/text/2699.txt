Health care needs and service use among
male prison inmates in the United States: A
multi-level behavioral model of prison
health service utilization
Kathryn M. Nowotny
Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study is to apply Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use to men's
prisons to assess the direct and indirect effects of inmate predisposing characteristics through multiple types of
need. Also examined are the effects of prison-specific enabling factors and the variation in use of health services
across prisons. This study uses a nationally representative U.S. sample of men incarcerated in state prisons
(n = 8816) and generalized structural equation and multilevel modeling. Five types of need--medical condition,
illness, dental problem, unintentional injury, and intentional injury--are assessed for their association with use of
health services.
Results: Findings indicate that a number of inmate predisposing (age, race, education) and vulnerability (mood/
anxiety disorder,) characteristics are associated with use of health services but are partially mediated by enabling
and need factors. Each type of medical need has strong direct effects with mood/anxiety disorder emerging as the
strongest total effect (including both direct effects and indirect effects through need). There is significant variation
in rates of health service utilization across prisons that is not accounted for by the prison-level factors included in
the multilevel model.
Conclusions: The varying patterns of health service use across prisons suggest that incarceration may be an
important circumstance that shapes health. In other words, where someone is incarcerated may influence their
ability to access and use services in response to medical need. It is important that prisons provide integrated
services for inmates with mood/anxiety disorder given high comorbidity with other health conditions.

Background
Most states' correctional health care spending has
increased substantially due in part to the challenges of
delivering health services in prisons (The Pew Charitable
Trusts, 2014). Conceptually, prisons represent a "equal
access" health care system in the United States (see
Delgado & Humm-Delgado, 2008) that minimizes
differences in economic status and health coverage simi-
lar to the Veteran's Health Administration (Saha et al.,
2008) and the Medicare program (Schneider et al, 2002).
In the landmark 1976 U.S. Supreme Court case Estelle v.
Gamble, the Court ruled that prisoners are entitled to ac-
cess to care for diagnosis and treatment, a professional
medical judgment, and administration of the treatment pre-
scribed by the physician. Specifically, the Court ruled that:
Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of
prisoners constitutes the "unnecessary and wanton
infliction of pain"... proscribed by the Eight Amendment.
This is true whether the indifference is manifested by
prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs
or by prison guards intentionally denying or delaying
access to medical care or intentionally interfering with

the treatment once prescribed. (Estelle v. Gamble, 429
E.S. 97, 104-05)
Thus, inmates have a constitutionally protected right
to care for their "serious medical needs."1 Additionally,
under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Person Act
(CRIPA; 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.) most jurisdictions are
required to staff medical and mental health professionals
to determine when an inmate is in need of medical or
mental health services (jails with less than 100 detainees
are exempt). However, reports indicate that nonmedical
correctional staff often perform screening during intake
(Patterson & Greifinger, 2006).
Traditional correctional settings are designed for
punishment, incapacitation, and deterrence (Cullen &
Jonson, 2011), goals which conflict with the aims of
health care (Watson, Stimpson, & Hostick, 2004). Allen
et al. (2010) summarize this tension stating:
Unlike most healthcare settings where the physician is
only responsible for the patient's welfare, doctors
working within corrections often find themselves caught
between the punitive aspect of the institutions' mission
and the best interests of their patients. This dual loyalty
conflict is made that much harder by the fact that many
features of the correctional system can directly conflict
with optimal treatment for a patient's medical
conditions. This can include the deleterious effect of
incarceration itself, especially for the mentally ill.
The healthcare infrastructure within correctional facilities
can create barriers limiting access to medical care (Magee,
Hult, & McMillan, 2005). Mandatory requirement of co-
pays, hygiene issues, administration of wrong medications,
medications stopped by mistake, delay in obtaining needed
medications, allergic reactions to medications, and other er-
rors on the part of the facility all contribute negatively to the
health of inmates (Hatton, Kleffel, & Fisher, 2006). Providing
diagnosis and treatment, and coordinating for transitions in
care upon release from prison can be extremely beneficial
for community public health (Binswanger, Redmond, Steiner,
& Hicks, 2011) and in reducing recidivism (Baillargeon,
Binswanger, Penn, Williams, & Murray, 2009).
The high rates of disease and illness in prisons
(Binswanger, Krueger, & Steiner, 2009; Wilper et al., 2009),
coupled with large incarceration rates for men and race/
ethnic minority groups, suggest a need to examine the role
of the prison in the administration of healthcare in U.S.
society given that prisons disproportionately house indi-
viduals with disadvantaged health profiles. It has been
documented that criminal-justice involved persons receive
only episodic care from correctional facilities and emer-
gency rooms (Boutwell & Freedman, 2014). The prison
population, specifically, makes up 1% of the total U.S.
population (PEW Center, 2008), but 11.4% of all black
men aged 20 to 34, and 37.2% of black men aged 20 to 34
with less than a high school education (Pettit, 2012). Black
men also have the highest mortality rates (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2016) and among the low-
est rates of health coverage (James, Thomas, Lillie-Blanton,
& Garfield, 2007; Smedley, Stith, & Nelsen, 2003).
Behavioral models of service use are useful in identifying
predictors of medical care and to assess whether health
service use is equitably distributed. In this study, Ander-
sen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, first devel-
oped in 1968 (Andersen, 1995), is adapted for use in
prisons. Andersen's model has been mainly used for
explaining health care utilization patterns by the general
population and suggests that use of health services is a
function of predisposition to use services, factors that en-
able or impede use, and need for care, thus providing a
way to conceptualize variations in utilization. The model
specifies both individual and contextual determinants of
health service use including individual's predisposing
characteristics (e.g., demographic variables, socioeconomic
status), enabling resources (e.g., health coverage, income),
and perceived need (on the part of the individual) and
evaluated need (on the part of a professional) (see Fig. 1).

Enabling factors are social factors that are thought to play
a role in access to care. As previously discussed, within a
prison access to care is supposedly the same for all in-
mates. Therefore, this study examines factors that shape
the day-to-day experience for inmates such as offender
status and hours spent in work assignment. Perceived
need for care should account for the majority of the ex-
plained variability in health service use. Put another way,
if service use is equitably distributed within and between
prisons, individuals who are most at need will be most
likely to use services, and other observed factors will not
influence use of services.
Andersen's model has been updated and modified
several times by Andersen and others (Andersen, 1995;
Andersen & Newman, 1973; Stein, Andersen, & Gelberg,
2007). For example, Gelberg, Andersen, and Leake
(2000) developed the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable
Populations. This expanded model includes specific
vulnerabilities found among homeless people such as
mental illness, substance use, and competing needs for
health services. Notably, Leukefeld et al. (1998) propose,
and later test (Garrity, Hiller, Staton, Webster, &
Leukefeld, 2002; Webster et al., 2005), a version of
Andersen's model for examining use of medical services
among drug-abusing offenders. They demonstrate that
pre-prison demographic and drug abuse history are
important predictors of medical service use.
This study is among the first to apply Andersen's
model to a diverse group of prison inmates using a
multilevel and structural equation modeling framework
to assess health service use across multiple need factors.
Specifically examined is how varying prison contexts and
inmate prison experience influence men's' use of health
services while incarcerated, above and beyond need. Also
examined are the potential indirect pathways on use of
health services through variation in need by demo-
graphic and vulnerable factors that inmates bring with
them--or "import" (Irwin & Cressey, 1962)--when they
are incarcerated. The overall research question is: what
are the factors associated with health service utilization
in men's prisons, and do utilization rates vary by prison?
Methods
Data
The 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF) provides
a nationally-representative sample of persons incarcer-
ated in state prisons (United States Department of
Justice. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2007). The sample
design employed a stratified, two-stage selection process.
There were 1401 male facilities included in the sampling
frame with the 14 largest male prisons selected with cer-
tainty. The remaining 1387 male prisons were stratified
by U.S. region and population size with 222 additional
facilities selected for participation. Prisoners were then
randomly selected for participation within each facility.
A total of 13,098 men were selected for participation
with a final overall sample size of 14,499 male and
female inmates. The survey asks respondents about their
incarceration history, offense characteristics, family and
background characteristics, drug and alcohol use and
abuse, prison activities, and self-reported health, mental
health, and treatment history.
The sample for the current analysis includes only men
who are currently serving time who are aged 18 or older.
Women are excluded since, by definition, they are
housed in separate facilities. Because of skip patterns in
the survey instrument, only those inmates who reported
any health problems (defined below) are included.
Respondents were only asked about using health services
if they reported a health problem. Therefore, there is not
information on people who used health services without
also self-reporting a health problem. Patterns of missing-
ness were examined and less than 5% of cases had no
missing information. Therefore, a listwise deletion was
performed to exclude cases with missing information.
The final sample size that is used for all of the analyses
in this study is 8816 men.2 All estimates are adjusted for
the complex study design. 3
Measures
Individual-level need and service use. The bivariate
outcome included use of any medical care4 as a result of
any of the need factors listed below. Overall, 83.6% of
inmates reporting a health need used health services.
"Serious medical needs" in this study were defined as
reporting a current medical condition5, an illness since
incarceration, a dental problem since incarceration, an
unintentional injury since incarceration, and an
intentional injury (e.g., assault) since incarceration. Al-
most one-third of inmates reported a medical condition
(30.8%) while three-quarters reported an illness while
incarcerated (73.5%). Sixty percent reported having a
dental problem during their current incarceration epi-
sode (60.8%). Finally, 27.3% experienced an uninten-
tional injury while 19.7% experienced an intentional
injury. Between 13.9% and 46.0% of those in need did
not use health services: 84.2% medical problem, 54.0%
illness, 86.1% dental problem, 79.7% unintentional injury,
70.6% intentional injury.
Individual-level predisposing factors. The characteris-
tics for all study variables are presented in Table 1.
Seven inmate-level predisposing factors were included:
age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Latino, other race), nativity (foreign born), marital
status (never married), education (at least high school),
employed prior to incarceration, and veteran status. The
average age for this sample was 36 years. The majority
Nowotny Health and Justice (2017) 5:9 Page 3 of 13
of inmates were men of color with 41% black, 17%
Latino, and 6% other race. Seven percent were foreign
born. About half of inmates had never been married
(56%) while about 70 % had a high school education
(68%) and or were employed prior to incarceration
(72%). Twelve percent reported serving in the military.
Individual-level vulnerability factors. There were four
vulnerability predisposing factors included: previous
incarceration episodes (zero, one, two, three or more;
mean = 1.09), mood/anxiety disorder (i.e., depression,
bipolar, anxiety, and or PTSD; 23%), schizophrenia (4%),
and alcohol/drug dependence (42%).
Contextual-level predisposing factors. There were
four prison-level predisposing factors computed by
aggregating self-reported measures to the prison level,
similar to previous prison studies (e.g., Jiang & Winfree,
2006; Steiner & Wooldredge, 2008). These factors in-
cluded proportion of inmates aged 25 or younger,
proportion of black inmates, proportion of Hispanic in-
mates, and proportion violent offenders. Table 1 shows
that there was wide variation in proportions across
prisons. For example, the mean proportion for black in-
mates was 0.41 with a range from 0.00 to 0.89 of inmates
within a prison.
Individual-level enabling factors. The six inmate-level
enabling factors were the number of years served to date
during the current incarceration episode (continuous),
offender status (violent offender and drug offender
compared to other), receiving visits from family and
friends in the past 12 months (0 visits, 1 visit, 2+ visits),
receiving a phone call from family/friends in the past
week (0 calls, 1 call, 2+ calls), and the number of hours
spent in work assignment during the past week (con-
tinuous). Thirteen percent of inmates had one visit with
family/friends in the past month with 17% having two or
more visits. A higher percentage of inmates had phone
calls with family/friends in the past week: 17% once and
29% two or more. Consistent with administrative data,
17% of inmates were drug offenders and 53% were vio-
lent offenders. Inmates spent an average of 14 h in work
assignment during the past week with a range from 0 h
to 40 h. Finally, the average length of time served to date
was 5.45 years with a range from less than one year to
44 years.
Analysis.
The analysis was carried out in two parts. First, follow-
ing Goodwin and Andersen (2002), stepwise logistic re-
gression models computed adjusted odds ratios and
identified the inmate predisposing, enabling, and need
correlates of using health services. This analysis did not
explicitly model variation in prison context or adjust for
the clustering of individuals into prison, but the models
are representative of the overall state prison population
of men. Model 1 included the predisposing factors and
vulnerability factors. Next, the enabling factors were
added, and then the need factors were added to assess
any potential mediating effects. If only the need factors
were significant in the final model, this would provide
evidence that use of services is equitably distributed for
male inmates.
Second, a generalized structural equation model
(GSEM) was estimated in Stata 13. Structural equation
modeling (SEM) is a general modeling framework that
can incorporate many common statistical methods in-
cluding regression, factor analysis, and simultaneous
equations, among others. This approach allows for the
assessment of mediation effects (indirect pathways) that
are estimated and tested in a single step that is more

This analysis built off the previous analysis to test the
analytical model presented in Figure 1. The multilevel
logistic regression model tested the direct effects of in-
mate predisposing, enabling, and need factors on health
service use and the indirect effects of inmate predispos-
ing factors on health service use through need. This
model also specified the prison-level predisposing factors
that influence health service use by inmates, and
whether use of health services varies across prisons. In-
direct and total effects were decomposed using the non-
linear combination command (nlcom) which provided
confidence intervals for the estimates.
Results
Table 2 presents the stepwise logistic regression models.
Model 1 included only the predisposing and vulnerability
factors and indicates that age (OR = 1.05, p  0.001), black
race (OR = 1.35, p  0.001), never married (OR = 1.19,
p  0.05), having a mood and or anxiety disorder
(OR = 1.35, p  0.001), and schizophrenia (OR = 1.79,
p  0.01) are associated with use of health services. When
the enabling factors were added to the model (Model 2),
there were some mediating effects among the predispos-
ing factors. Being a violent offender increased the odds of
using services (OR = 1.28, p  0.001). Hours in work as-
signment had a minimal effect (OR = 1.00, p  0.05) while
every year incarcerated contributed to 21% higher odds of
using health services (OR = 1.21, p  0.001), but this effect
lessens over time (OR = 0.99, p  0.001).
The final model, Model 3, had the best overall model
fit as indicated by the log likelihood ratio, AIC, and BIC.
Similar to Model 2, there were some mediating effects
when the need factors are included. This suggested a
more complex relationship among these domains of
factors than could be evaluated in a regression frame-
work and provided empirical justification for use of a
structural equation modeling framework. As expected,
each of the five need factors were highly significant
when controlling for predisposing and enabling factors.
Having a medical condition increased the odds of using
health services by a factor of 7.28 (p  0.001). Illness had
the smallest effect with an odds ratio of 1.88 (p  0.001)
while reporting a dental problem had the largest effect
with an odds ratio of 8.22 (p  0.001). With regards to
injury, men reporting an unintentional injury had higher
odds of using health services (OR = 6.40, p  0.001)
compared to intentional injury (OR = 3.38, p  0.001).
Table 3 presents the results of the generalized structural
equation model. A baseline model indicated that a
multilevel approach was a better fit over a single level
model (p  0.001) and that 11.9% of the variation in health
service use was due to variation between prisons (not
shown). Similar to the above analysis, all five need factors
were statistically significant and once need is controlled
few predisposing factors remained significant predictors of
health service use. Use of medical care increased with age
(OR = 1.03, p  0.001) after controlling for need. Black
men had higher odds of reporting using health services
compared to white men (OR = 1.24, p  0.05). Finally,
men who reported being diagnosed with schizophrenia
had higher odds of reporting use of health services inde-
pendent of need (OR = 2.36, p  0.001).
Some predisposing factors appeared to have indirect
effects on medical care by changing the need for ser-
vices. However, there were no predisposing factors that
consistently affected need across all five domains. Age
had a positive effect on having a current medical prob-
lem (OR = 1.05, p  0.001), reporting an illness while in-
carcerated (OR = 1.02, p  0.001), and reporting a dental
problem (OR = 1.03, p  0.001), but age had a small
negative effect on injury, both unintentional (OR = 0.99,
p  0.001) and intentional (OR = 0.99, p  0.01). Men
with a high school education had lower odds of report-
ing a current medical problem (OR = 0.89, p  0.05), but
had higher odds of reporting an illness (OR = 1.39,
p  0.001), dental problem (OR = 1.12, p  0.05), and
unintentional injury (OR = 1.42, p  0.001). The predis-
posing vulnerability factors also appeared to influence
medical need. Having a mood/anxiety disorder increased
the odds of having a current medical condition two-fold
(OR 1.99, p  0.001) as well as increased the odds of
having a dental problem (OR = 1.24, p  0.001), uninten-
tional injury (OR = 1.18, p  0.05), and intentional injury
(1.63, p  0.001). The only need factor not associated
with mood/anxiety disorder was illness. Men with a
history of alcohol/drug dependence had higher odds of
reporting a dental problem (OR = 1.15, p  0.01) and
suffering an intentional injury (OR = 1.13, p  0.05). The
comorbidity of health conditions was examined further
(Table 4). Mood/anxiety disorder was comorbid with all
of conditions except for illness. Overall, mood/anxiety
disorder and schizophrenia had the strongest association
among the health conditions in this study. The patterns
of co-occurrence among the physical, mental and behav-
ioral health problems were generally maintained in the
multivariate models in Table 3. Among the mental and
behavioral health vulnerability factors, mood/anxiety
disorder emerged an important co-occurring condition
for the medical outcomes.
Given the potentially strong indirect effects of mood/
anxiety disorder, the effects on medical care were
decomposed (Figure 2). The log odds of mood/anxiety
disorder on any health service use was 0.53 (p  0.001).
Nowotny Health and Justice (2017) 5:9 Page 5 of 13
Medical need fully mediated this relationship so that the
log odds were reduced to -0.07 (n.s.). The indirect ef-
fects of mood/anxiety disorder through the need factors
were calculated as the product of the two direct effects
involved in the mediation. For example, the log odds of
mood/anxiety disorder on having a medical problem was
0.69 and the log odds of having a medical problem on
any health service use was 2.10 for an indirect effect of
1.44 log odds or a 4.22 odds ratio. The total effect of
mood/anxiety disorder on any health treatment was
calculated by combining the direct effect and the five
mediation (indirect) effects where the total effect was

(OR = 15.7, p  0.001) which was substantially larger than
the direct effect (OR = 0.93). This means that given vari-

and prison-level factors were accounted for.
Discussion
Using an adapted version of Andersen's Behavioral
Model of Health Service Use, this study found that
between 13.9% and 46.0% of men with medical health
needs did not use health services in prison. Men were
most likely to use health services in response to a med-
ical condition or dental problem, and were least likely to
use health services for an illness. Men are also less likely
to seek medical care for an intentional injury compared
to unintentional injury. This may be due to the serious-
ness of the injuries. It is also possible that inmates are
hesitant to use health services for intentional injuries for
fear of getting in trouble with correctional staff. There
are a number of findings related to prison-level factors
and inmate-level predisposing and enabling factors that
warrant further discussion.
First, inmates in the United States have a constitution-
ally protected right to health care. Therefore, we should
expect uniform patterns of utilization across prisons
after accounting for need. However, there is significant
variation between prisons in rates of health service use
ranging from 50 to 94% (95% interval) of inmates in
need using health services. This indicates that, not even
accounting for the quality of services, not all inmates are
having their service needs met despite constitutional
protections. In other words, the multilevel model shows
unexplained variation in utilization rates between
prisons (after controlling for inmate-level differences)
that are unexpected given legal mandates in the Unites
States. For example, the proportion of violent offenders
is positively associated with rates of medical care
utilization. This could indicate differences in availability
of health services based on security level since violent
offenders tend to be incarcerated in higher security
prisons. It was also found that the proportion of black
men positively influence use of health services. This may
be due to regional or state-level variation since black
adults are clustered in specific geographic areas which
shape inmate composition (Mauer & King, 2007; Sakala,
2014). These findings suggest that (1) where someone is
incarcerated may influence their ability to access and use
health services; and (2) further analysis is needed to bet-
ter examine the prison context including consideration
of objective prison enabling factors such as staffing, size
of prison, and overcrowding. This is especially important
given recent court orders to improve correctional health
care delivery within several states (e.g., California,
Arizona). Nevertheless, the findings emphasize that,
overall, health service utilization in prison cannot be
fully explained by inmate characteristics.
Second, findings indicate that inequalities in use of
services while incarcerated seem to be largely driven by
differences in predisposing factors on need. Although
this is a promising finding, this particular analysis ad-
dresses differences in health services use regardless of
why inmates may have differential levels of need. More
specifically, research on health service use that takes into
account health selection effects is greatly needed. For ex-
ample, after adjusting for differences in need, black men
are significantly more likely to utilize treatment com-
pared to white men. These findings suggest that prisons
may be an important site for healthcare for black men in
U.S. society given their low levels of access to healthcare
outside of prison and their high rates of incarceration
(see also (Nowotny & Kathryn, 2015)). Research has
consistently documented black-white disparities in
healthcare for noninstitutionalized adults (Hayward,
Miles, Crimmins, & Yang, 2000; Marmot, 2005). For
example, a 2007 Kaiser Family Foundation report provides
evidence for racial differences in health insurance cover-
age, access to primary care, and treatment for specific
medical conditions (James et al., 2007). Some studies find
that racial disparities persist even after adjustment for
socioeconomic differences and other healthcare-related
factors (Kressin & Petersen, 2001; Mayberry, Mili, & Ofili,
2000). It may be that the reversal of the disparity in
prisons is due to black men's motivation to seek care given
their limited ability to access care in the community.
Among the vulnerability factors, inmates with mood/
anxiety disorder are more likely to have medical need. In
total, inmates with mood/anxiety disorder are 15 times
more likely to use health services in prison. It is
especially concerning that inmates with mood/anxiety
disorder have higher odds of experiencing both uninten-
tional and intentional injuries while incarcerated. This
speaks to the vulnerability of inmates with mental health
problems. Schizophrenia does not follow this pattern,
however, which may be attributed to different housing
choices for men with schizophrenia. These findings
suggest that (1) clinicians providing services to patients
in correctional settings need to be trained on how to
provide effective health care to individuals living with
mood/anxiety disorder; (2) it may be necessary to pro-
vide comprehensive integrated (psychological/medical)
Nowotny Health and Justice (2017) 5:9 Page 10 of 13
care services to these inmates; and (3) prisons may not
be safe places for persons living with mood/anxiety
disorder.
The only enabling factor that was significant is phone
calls from family and friends. Thus, social support may
be an important factor for encouraging inmates to use
health services. Including additional indicators of sub-
jective social support in future studies may help to better
understand how extra-prison social bonds influence use
of health services behind bars. Enabling factors, in gen-
eral, are important because they can be modified (unlike
predisposing factors). For example, prisons can decrease
barriers to maintain extra prison social bonds or provide
support for family reunification efforts.
Conceptually, the varying patterns of health service
use across prisons suggest that incarceration is a social
circumstance that shapes health differentials (Galea &
Vlahov, 2002). For example, previous attempts at under-
standing use of health services in prison focused only on
inmate-level predisposing and mediating (enabling)
factors even though criminological research has consist-
ently documented that the prison environment is an im-
portant determinant of inmate behavior including use of
health services as suggested by Anno (1997). This study
finds that there is a significant and troubling variation
across U.S. prisons in terms of health service use. More-
over, there are both direct and indirect effects of this
variation. Wacquant (2000) argues that healthcare in
prison may act as a "stabilizing and restorative force,"
and black men are more likely to utilize health services
which has the potential to improve health for the high
proportion of black men cycled through U.S. prisons. In
fact, research documents a mortality advantage for black
men who are incarcerated (Rosen, Wohl, & Schoenbach,
2011; Wildeman, Carson, Golinelli, Noonan, & Emanuel,
2016). Unfortunately, this study cannot account for the
quality of services or differential adherence, and any
health benefit afforded in prisons may be outweighed by
the long-term health consequences of incarceration
(Massoglia, 2008; Massoglia, Pare, Schnittker, & Gagnon,
2014; Porter, 2014; Spaulding et al., 2011). For example,
Patterson (Patterson, 2013) analyzed 15 years of admin-
istrative data from New York and found a dose-response
of time serviced in prison on mortality. Each additional
year served in prison produced a 15.6% increase in the
odds of death for parolees, which translates to a 2-year
decline in life expectancy for each year served.
There are a number of important study limitations to
consider. First, this study relies on self-reported health
conditions. However, self-report data are an essential
and commonly used source of health indicators in re-
search (Stone et al., 1999), and the SISCF is the best data
set available to answer the research question because it
is the only large, nationally representative survey of
inmates available in the United States. It has also been
argued that individuals must perceive a need for the
utilization of health services (de Boer, Wijker, & de Haes,
1997; Jahangir, Irazola, & Rubinstein, 2012). Related, the
data are cross-sectional and do not provide information
on onset of health conditions. That is, this study is un-
able to account for the timing of diagnosis or the sever-
ity of symptoms and the timing or quality of care. The
data are further limited since there is no way to intro-
duce objective prison-level and state-level controls and
must rely on aggregate measures of composition. It is
possible that this study has mistakenly assigned variation
in inmate medical care usage to prison-level variables ra-
ther than differences in custody classification within
prisons (Worrall & Morris, 2011). This study does not
control for selection effects ­ neither selection into
prison nor selection into need for treatment. Future re-
search should examine selection processes and within
prison differences in inmate health behaviors. Finally, fu-
ture research should give particular attention to incar-
cerated women because incarcerated women have worse
health (Anderson, 2003; Sered & Norton-Hawk, 2008)
and lower programming availability (Eliason, Taylor, &
Williams, 2004) compared to incarcerated men, and
women's prisons often struggle to meet the healthcare
needs of women (Delgado & Humm-Delgado, 2008;
Eliason et al., 2004). Therefore, the experience of in-
carcerated women is shaped by distinct structural
processes.
Conclusion
Even though these data are more than ten years old, this
study makes a theoretical contribution by applying the
behavioral model of health services use for vulnerable
populations to prisons. Future research should apply this
model to other types of health service outcomes relevant
for inmates such as use of drug treatment services and
incorporate objective prison-level factors. It is also pos-
sible that predisposing, enabling, and prison-level factors
operate differently for women in prison, and for other
environments such as federal prisons and local county
jails. Nevertheless, this study documents the direct and
indirect effects of inmate characteristics and vulnerabil-
ities on use of health services in men's prisons, as well
as the direct effects of the prison enabling and prison-
level factors, across multiple types of medical need.
Notes
1A "serious" medical need is defined as "the existence of
an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find
important and worthy of comment or treatment; the
presence of a medical condition that significantly affects
an individual's daily activities; or the existence of chronic
and substantial pain are examples of indications that a

Ogloff, Roesch, & Hart, 1994 and Wool, 2007. 2The final
sample size available from BJS is 14,499 persons. In this
study, 27 respondents were dropped because they were
less than 18 years of age. The number of females
dropped is 2927, and the number of individuals who are
not serving a sentence is 152.1818 people did not report
a medical problem (as defined in this study) and there-
fore had no information on the outcome of interest be-
cause of the skip patterns built into the survey. This
leaves a sample of 9191 men who meet the study cri-
teria. 375 of these men have missing information on at
least one variable included in the study, which is less
than 5%. The listwise deletion leaves the final sample
size of 8816 men in 225 prisons. This is a mean of 39 in-
mates per prison; range 3 to 62. Only three prisons have
less than 10 inmates. 3BJS recommendations for sample
survey weights were followed for all single level analyses.
