A Prospective Study
Beth E. Molnar, ScD; Angela Browne, PhD; Magdalena Cerda, MPH; Stephen L. Buka, ScD
Objective: To assess the relationships between indi-
vidual victimization and neighborhood-level violence on
subsequent violent perpetration by adolescent girls in a
community-based sample.
Design: Longitudinal, multilevel analysis of data col-
lected by the Project on Human Development in Chi-
cago Neighborhoods. Three in-home interviews were con-
ducted approximately 24 months apart between
November 1995 and January 2002 with youth and their
caregivers. Community-level data also were collected in
1995 from a random sample of Chicago residents. Hier-
archical regression models and propensity scores were
used.
Setting: Families and neighborhoods in Chicago.
Participants: Population-based sample of 637 girls, ages
9 to 15 years at baseline, and the neighborhoods in which
they resided. This sample is diverse in race/ethnicity, so-
cioeconomic status, family structure, and neighbor-
hood characteristics.
Main Outcome Measure: Self-reports of violent be-
havior in the 12 months before the third interview.
Results: At baseline, 38% of the girls reported perpetrat-
ing at least 1 violent behavior in the prior 12 months, 28%
reported past year violent behavior at the first follow-up
interview, and 14% reported past year violent behavior at
the third interview. The odds of violent behavior were 2.2
times higher among girls who reported prior violent vic-
timization, after prior confounding factors and baseline
violent behavior were controlled (95% confidence inter-
val, 1.3- 4.4). Homicides and concentrated poverty in girls'
neighborhoodsalsowereassociatedwithaggressionbygirls.
Conclusions: Improvingsafetyincommunitiesandhomes

Study results suggest that, to facilitate identification of and
healing among adolescent survivors of violence, practi-
tioners should recognize perpetration of violence as po-
tential sequelae of prior violent victimization.

VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED AND
perpetrated by adoles-
cents is a serious public
health problem, affecting
individuals, families, and
communities. Adolescents are exposed to
a great deal of violence in their homes and
communities; this exposure has been as-
sociated with their own violent perpetra-
tion as reported across numerous stud-
ies.1,2 Rates of sexual assault3,4 and
victimization occurring at home5,6 are typi-
cally higher for girls than for boys, whereas
rates of nonsexual violent victimization
outside the home are lower for girls.3,7
Two types of data provide prevalence
estimates of youth violence: arrest data and
self-report data. Although both sources in-
dicate a decrease in rates of violence among
youth since the mid 1990s, levels of in-
volvement remain high. National arrest
data showed a peak in arrests of teenag-
ers for violent crimes in 1994 of just over
500 arrests for every 100 000 youth aged
from 10 to 17 years, and a subsequent de-
cline of 47% by 2002 to 276 arrests for ev-
ery 100 000.8 However, in contrast to de-
clining rates for boys, rates of arrest for
violent crimes by adolescent girls either in-
creased, or decreased less, across catego-
ries of violent offenses.8 This trend gave
rise to concern that girls were becoming
more violent.9-12
Arrest rates can be difficult to inter-
pret. Large increases in arrest rates for girls
are, in part, a result of low base rates.10
Even with increases in arrest rates, girls
accounted for just 24% of juvenile arrests
for aggravated assaults in 2002.8 Arrest
rates also measure societal reactions to be-

havior, not necessarily behavior itself; growth in arrests
may represent changes in the application of laws by gen-
der or in the willingness of the public to report crimes.8
Thus, while there is a popular belief that girls' violence
is growing, the true extent of violence by girls is un-
known.
Self-report data by teens show a decrease in violent be-
havior over the past decade for both girls and boys.13 The
percentage of students reporting "being in a physical fight
in the past 12 months" in the nationally representative
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey, a school-based
survey of 9th through 12th graders, declined from 1993
through 2003. Specifically, the percentage of girls in-
volved in a physical fight dropped from 31.7% in 1993 to
25.1% during 2003 (a decrease was reported by boys from
51.2% to 40.5%).4,14 Still, that one quarter of 9th through
12th grade girls nationwide reported physically fighting
with others in a 12-month period underscores the need
for further investigation of potential causes.
EXPOSURE TO VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION
Exposure to violence in the home includes being the vic-
tim of child physical or sexual abuse by intimates, wit-
nessing violence between caregivers, and violent alter-
cations with family members, including siblings. Each
type of victimization has been shown to be a risk factor
for adolescent aggression as well as for delinquency and
involvement with the criminal justice system.15-20 Addi-
tionally, studies indicate that girls who perpetrate vio-
lence are significantly more likely to have experienced
sexual violence than nonaggressive girls.1,17,21-23
Research consistently identifies exposure to violence
in the neighborhood as a precursor to adolescents' vio-
lent behavior, typically using individual reports of neigh-
borhood exposures.1,3,21,24,25 Examining the effects of ag-
gregated neighborhood conditions in addition to
individual reports is a burgeoning area of scientific in-
quiry in public health,26 especially as the statistical meth-
ods for analyzing hierarchical data have evolved.27 As an
example of the effect of neighborhood conditions on ado-
lescent behavior, higher levels of physical and social dis-
order and having fewer safe places for children to play
both were associated with a higher likelihood of youths
carrying concealed firearms, even when individual risk
factors for gun carrying were controlled.28
The current inquiry focuses on individual-level vic-
timization and neighborhood violence and their rela-
tionships to the subsequent perpetration of violent be-
haviors by adolescent girls. Although most studies
focusing on girls' violent behavior have used special popu-
lations (eg, clinically referred or juvenile justice samples)
or cross-sectional surveys, this study examines girls' vio-
lent behavior prospectively among a representative, di-
verse, community-based sample. Aims of the inquiry were
to describe violent behaviors by girls across 3 waves of
data and to identify both individual- and neighborhood-
level risk factors for violence perpetration, in addition
to more traditional factors such as age, family composi-
tion, family socioeconomic status, and baseline rates of
violent behavior.
METHODS
Data for this study of girls' violence came from the Project on
Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN).
The PHDCN is a multidisciplinary, longitudinal study of the
development of antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and men-
tal health among youth and their primary caregivers, as well
as a study of their neighborhoods over time. Detailed methods
are published elsewhere.29
STUDY DESIGN
Informed consent for each interview was obtained from a par-
ent or guardian of the subject in the longitudinal cohort study.
Assent was obtained from the youth respondents prior to each
assessment. Procedures were approved by 2 institutional re-
view boards at Harvard University, Boston, Mass.
The design of the PHDCN consists of a longitudinal cohort
study imbedded within a community study. Neighborhood-
level data for PHDCN participants were obtained from (1) a
community survey of 8782 randomly selected Chicago resi-
dents conducted in 1995, (2) data on violent crime in 1995,
obtained from the Chicago Police Department, and (3) US Cen-
sus data from 1990. Individual- and family-level data were col-
lected by a longitudinal cohort study completed between No-
vember 1994 and January 2002, in which overall 6226 children
and their caregivers were enrolled.
SAMPLING
Chicago neighborhoods were initially grouped into 343 neigh-
borhood clusters, each with approximately 8000 residents. Strati-
fied probability sampling was then used to select a sample of
80 neighborhood clusters diverse in race/ethnic and socioeco-
nomic composition for intensive study.
For the longitudinal cohort study, dwelling units were enu-
merated and approximately 35 000 randomly sampled house-
holds were screened for children and adolescents of eligible ages
within the 80 selected neighborhoods. Children who were within
6 months of 7 target cohort ages (0 [in utero through the age
of 6 months], 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were invited to par-
ticipate. The participation rate was 75%. A primary caregiver
was enrolled for all children except the 18-year-old cohort. Three
in-home interviews were conducted at approximately 24-
month intervals between 1995 and 2002. Individual-level data
for the current analyses come from girls enrolled in cohorts 9,
12, and 15 years and their primary caregivers.
MEASURES
Table 1 displays the instruments used at each of the 3 inter-
views and how each measure was used in the present analysis.
As noted in Table 1, the individual-level confounders and neigh-
borhood-level variables described below were measured at wave
1 (the first interview), individual-level victimization expo-
sures were measured at wave 2, and outcomes were measured
at wave 3. Additionally, 3 waves of self-report violent behav-
ior data were used to describe prevalence across the age range
of study participants.
OUTCOMES: PERPETRATION OF VIOLENCE
Questionnaires were administered in respondents' homes by
trained interviewers. Based on a scale adapted from an earlier
instrument by Elliott et al,30 perpetration of 1 or more of the
following 8 past-year violent behaviors with intent to cause in-

jury were examined at each of the 3 interviews: (1) hitting some-
one outside of the home; (2) attacking with a weapon; (3) us-
ing weapons or force to rob someone; (4) picking pockets or
purse snatching; (5) throwing rocks and bottles; (6) setting fires
to buildings, cars, or property; (7) carrying a hidden weapon;
and (8) participating in a gang fight. The outcome measure was
developed based on third-interview responses by girls on this
scale. Items were selected because they were aggressive acts
against people and because item-response analysis31,32 of their
psychometric properties showed that, as a scale, they had good
reliability and validity. An item measuring hitting people within
the home did not fit well and was dropped.33
At the third interview, girls reported 6 of 8 original violent
act items (at baseline they had reported all 8). This led us to
base the outcome measures for the statistical model solely on
the 6 outcomes that were reported by at least 1 of the respon-
dents--hitting someone outside the home; attacking with a
weapon; throwing rocks or bottles; setting fires to buildings,
cars or property; carrying a hidden weapon; and participating
in a gang fight. (Using weapons or force to rob someone and
picking pockets or purse snatching were not reported in the
third interview.)
INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL EXPOSURE:
VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION
The main individual-level exposure variable for this study was
violent victimization, as reported at the second interview. Mea-
sures included whether girls were attacked with a weapon, beaten
up, chased, shot at, or threatened with serious harm in the past
year, as well as reports of past-year sexual assault (molesta-
tion or rape). These measures come from My Exposure to Vio-
lence, an instrument developed by the PHDCN.34 Psychomet-
ric study of the scale of violent victimization showed good item
fit, good reliability (Cronbach =.83), and good construct va-
lidity (the scale relates to behavioral and emotional symptoms
in predictable ways). It was initially determined that sexual as-
sault was better treated as a separate item since it did not cor-
relate as highly with the others and the Cronbach  for the non-
sexual victimization scale did not decrease with its deletion.
However, given that a high degree of overlap existed between
those who were physically and sexually victimized and the low
prevalence of past-year sexual assault in our sample, we con-
structed one combined measure of violent victimization, indi-
cating experiencing at least one of those forms--sexual and/or
nonsexual--of violent victimization in the past year.
INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL CONFOUNDERS
All individual and family confounders were measured at base-
line. Using the same measures of violent events as was used
for the study outcome measure, self-reported violence is a sum
of violent behaviors by the girls in the year prior to the base-
line interview. Family socioeconomic status is a composite of
3 variables: parental income, parental educational level, and pa-
rental occupational code, created using principal components
analysis. The maximum value was used for each of the 3 vari-
ables if there were 2 parents in the household. Deviance of peers
consists of the degree to which girls' peer groups engaged in
risky and/or prosocial behaviors. Given the large number of in-
dicators of peer deviance, cluster analysis helped us to first iden-
tify groupings that represented substantive dimensions of in-
terest. Principal components analysis then allowed us to create
uncorrelated weighted linear composites with maximum vari-
ances. The original 30 variables measured the number of peers
who displayed the following specific characteristics in the past
year: cluster 1, involved in risky activities (skipping school, tak-
ing a vehicle without permission, selling drugs, using illegal
substances, and/or having sexual intercourse); cluster 2, dis-
playing negative relations with others (not getting along with
teachers, disobeying school rules, getting in trouble in school
and/or at home, lying and/or disobeying adults, and hitting some-
one to hurt them); cluster 3, displaying positive characteris-
tics (considered good citizens, good students, and/or gener-
ally honest); cluster 4, involved in criminal activities (stealing,
breaking and/or entering, and/or attacking with a weapon); and

cluster 5, involved in prosocial activities (nonsport school ac-
tivity, school sports, or community and/or religious activi-
ties). Illegal substance use is the number of days of use of al-
cohol, marijuana, cocaine, crack, and inhalants in the past year.
Family structure was classified as whether the youth respon-
dent was living with 1 biological parent, 2 biological parents,
1 nonbiological parent, or 1 biological and 1 nonbiological par-
ent. Age, race/ethnicity, and parents' marital status (married
vs not married) also were included.
NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL EXPOSURES
For each neighborhood cluster, neighborhood-level measures
were estimated using aggregated data from 3 sources: the US
Census, the 1995 PHDCN Community Survey, and the Chi-
cago Police Department. These data sources provided esti-
mates of neighborhood conditions independent of data ob-
tained from individual girls and their caregivers. Violent
victimization at the neighborhood level was measured by 1 di-
chotomous item from the 1995 community survey (aggre-
gated to the neighborhood cluster level) asking whether any-
one in the household had been the victim of a mugging, fight,
or sexual assault since they began living in that neighbor-
hood. The Chicago Police Department provided data to esti-
mate the 1995 homicide rate for each neighborhood cluster.
This rate was calculated by taking the number of homicides and
dividing by the 1990 population count, using the formula
log{[(homicides/population count)100 000]1}. Addition-
ally, a neighborhood-level covariate was used to control for po-
tential confounding: a scale of concentrated poverty was de-
rived from 1990 US Census measures of (1) percentage living
below the poverty line, (2) percentage unemployed, and (3)
percentage on public assistance, using principal components
analysis.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
To describe the patterns of violent behavior across the 3 waves
of data collection, we constructed age-violence curves delin-
eated by individual-level victimization. Coefficients from a re-
peated-measures marginal model with a binomial distribution
were used to create the curves. Violent behaviors and history
of victimization at all 3 waves were in the model, as well as fam-
ily socioeconomic status. Since there is a trend for violence per-
petration to desist during late adolescence,35 it was expected
that violence would decrease across the years of the study. Age-
violence curves were created for the whole sample, as well as
separately for girls exposed and unexposed to violent victim-
ization. We hypothesized that girls exposed to violence would
have higher rates of violent perpetration and perhaps desist more
slowly during the study period.
Next, we estimated the likelihood of perpetrating violence
by using a multivariate, 3-level random intercept Rasch mea-
surement model with wave 3 violence items at level 1; individual-
level predictors, a propensity score in quintiles, and random
effects at level 2; and neighborhood-level covariates at level 3.
Raudenbush et al33 described and demonstrated the validity of
this method.
PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSIS
Rather than include a large set of potential confounders of the
main relationship of interest in the multilevel models, a pro-
pensity score derived from the baseline data was used to rep-
resent the confounders in a single composite.36 Propensity score
analysis has been shown to produce estimates that are less bi-
ased, more robust, and more precise than logistic regression
estimates when there are 7 or fewer exposed subjects per con-
founder.37 Propensity score analysis uses a preliminary regres-
sion model to identify predictors of victimization (the expo-
sure in this study) from observed background characteristics
that preceded the victimization. It then uses the estimated prob-
ability of being victimized to represent all of the background
characteristics. By dividing the propensity score into quin-
tiles, and examining the data to see whether a balanced num-
ber of victimized and nonvictimized girls fall into each quin-
tile, we were able to ensure that we had sufficient data to compare
exposed and unexposed subjects who had similar values on the
confounding variables. Additionally, use of this method avoided
potential overparameterization of the model, given the large
number of confounders and the low prevalence of violent be-
havior by the third interviews.
Confounders in the propensity score (all described above)
included age at enrollment, race/ethnicity, parental marital sta-
tus, family structure, and socioeconomic status, in addition to
behavioral indicators found to have a significant association with
being in fights as either perpetrator or victim: peer devi-
ance,38-41 illegal substance use,40 and previous perpetration of
violence.41 Missing confounder variables were given "0" if cat-
egorical and the mean value if continuous, and dummy vari-
ables indicating the presence of missing observations for each
specific covariate were included. This imputation of missing
confounder variables affected 5.0% of the sample. The one neigh-
borhood-level variable included as a potential confounder, con-
centrated poverty, was entered separately into the 3-level ana-
lytic models, rather than as a neighborhood-level propensity
score.
STATISTICAL MODELS
Models first estimated the association between victimization
and propensity to perpetrate violence, controlling solely for age
(centered at the age of 14 years, since it was the mean age to
commit violent acts among girls as noted in the literature) and
age squared at level 1. The models then introduced the pro-
pensity score to adjust for individual-level confounders at level
2. The propensity score was divided into quintiles and entered
as 4 categories (quintile 5 as the reference) to avoid assump-
tions of linearity of the association between the propensity score
and the outcome. In addition to its inclusion in the propensity
score, additional adjustment for baseline reports of perpetra-
tion of violence was initially introduced in the models. How-
ever, since such adjustment did not change the magnitude or
significance of the associations and baseline violence was not
significantly associated with future perpetration after adjust-
ment for the propensity score, this variable was deleted from
the models. Models then estimated the association between
neighborhood-level violence and perpetration by introducing
neighborhood-level victimization and the 1995 neighborhood
homicide rate at level 3. Further adjustment was made for neigh-
borhood-level confounding by introducing concentrated pov-
erty. Propensity scores were estimated using SAS, version 8,42
and multilevel models were estimated using HLM, version 5.43
ANALYTIC SAMPLE
Of the 1164 girls who had completed the first interview, 82%
were retained at the second interview, and 68.6% were re-
tained at the third interview. Of the 799 respondents who par-
ticipated in all 3 interviews, 5 persons had missing observa-
tions on all the victimization exposure items at wave 2, and 1
person had missing data on all the violent perpetration items
at wave 3. This led to a sample of 793 subjects. To maximize
the longitudinal order of the data, we then removed 156 sub-

jects who had been victimized prior to wave 2. We had ini-
tially considered using the sample of 793 subjects and con-
trolling for victimization prior to wave 2. This led to an
imbalance in the propensity score whereby 157 subjects did
not have a "match" of unexposed in terms of control for con-
founding and would have to be removed from the analysis.
The final sample thus consisted of 637 girls who (1) com-
pleted all 3 interviews, (2) answered at least 1 of the items of
interest on violent perpetration and 1 of the items of interest
on victimization exposure, and (3) had not been victimized
prior to wave 2.
The final analytic sample differed in 3 important ways from
those who dropped out of the study or were removed from the
study because of missing observations or prior victimization:
the removed subjects were more likely to report deviant peers,
less likely to have married caregivers, and more likely to have
a higher rate of baseline violence.
RESULTS
The Figure illustrates the pattern of girls' violent be-
havior across the 3 waves of data. Looking at the curve
for the full sample, there was a peak in violent behavior
for all girls at the age of 14 years, with an initial increase
with age, then a later decrease, as expected during ado-
lescence.35 By displaying stratified curves (victimized at
any wave vs not victimized at any wave vs all respon-
dents), these curves give preliminary indications that the
prevalence of violent behavior is higher among girls who
report violent victimization than among girls who did not.
Additionally, the acceleration of violent behavior was
steeper for the victimized girls, with a peak at the age of
17 years. More than one third (38%) of the respondents
reported perpetrating at least 1 type of violent behavior
in the 12 months prior to the baseline interview; more
than one quarter (28%) of the girls reported perpetrat-
ing violent behavior in the 12 months prior to the first
follow-up interview, and one-seventh (14%) of the girls
reported violence at the third interview.

violence at wave 3 (24.5%) than girls who had never been
victimized (11.3%) (Table 2). As summarized in Table 3,
girls who had been violently victimized also were more
likely to report associations with deviant peers and us-
ing illegal substances, and were in the oldest age cohort
at baseline. They were less likely to report having peers
who exhibited positive characteristics and more likely to
report black or other race/ethnicity and having unmar-
ried parents (Table 3).
The propensity score model, which denotes the pro-
pensity of individuals to be victimized, had a c-statistic
of 0.72. This indicated that the propensity score model
had an adequate capacity to predict exposure to victim-
ization; thus, by including the propensity score in the main
study model, it was possible to adequately control for se-
lection.
Table 4 lists the crude and adjusted models estimat-
ing the association between past-year victimization ex-
periences reported at wave 2 and the probability of re-
porting perpetrating violence in wave 3. It also reports
on the association between neighborhood violence and
the probability of violent behavior by girls. Model 1 in-
dicates that, controlling only for age at wave 3, girls who
had been victimized by wave 2 had 2.9 times higher odds
(95% confidence interval [CI]=1.7-5.1) of reporting hav-
ing perpetrated violence at wave 3 than girls who had not
been victimized. Adjustment for the propensity score re-
sulted in a decrease in magnitude of the odds of perpe-
trating violence (odds ratio [OR]=2.4, 95% CI=1.3-
4.5). Further adjustment for concentrated poverty of the
neighborhood did not change the magnitude of the es-
timate. Concentrated poverty was independently asso-
ciated with a higher probability of perpetrating violence
(OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.1-2.1).
The probability of violent perpetration by girls was not
higher in neighborhoods with more reports of violent
victimization by residents. However, in neighborhoods
with higher homicide rates, there was a trend toward
higher probability of violence by girls (OR=1.1, 95%
CI=0.9-1.02). When we examined cross-level interac-
tions between neighborhood violence and individual vic-
timization (Table 5), we found that the effect of indi-
vidual-level victimization on subsequent violent behavior
was approximately the same whether girls lived in neigh-
borhoods without homicides (OR=5.5, 95% CI=2.3-
13.0) or in neighborhoods with a 1-unit increase in the
homicide rate (OR=5.4, 95% CI=4.3-6.8). However, we
found a cross-level interaction between neighborhood
concentrated poverty and individual victimization. The
effect of individual-level victimization (with or without
homicides, OR=3.9, 95% CI=3.0-4.9 or OR=4.0, 95%
CI=1.8-9.0, respectively) on violent behavior was greater
for girls from neighborhoods which were better off (with
or without homicides) while the effect of victimization
on violent behavior in neighborhoods with a 1-unit higher
level of concentrated poverty was less strong and no longer
statistically significant, with or without homicides
(OR=1.9, 95% CI=0.4-8.7 or OR=2.0, 95% CI=0.4-
9.0, respectively).
COMMENT
In this study, adolescent girls were more likely to act vio-
lently if they had previously experienced violent victim-
ization, and if they lived in impoverished and/or se-
verely violent communities. Additionally, a cross-level
interaction was found indicating that, in neighbor-
hoods that have less concentrated poverty, the effect of
individual-level victimization on violent behavior is even
stronger. Further investigation into neighborhood char-
acteristics is needed to explain this differential impact of
victimization.
These results highlight the critical role that violent vic-
timization plays in the development of aggression by girls.
Even when socioeconomic status, previous violence per-
petration, deviant peer behavior, illegal substance use,
and other family and individual characteristics were con-
sidered, violent victimization remained an important risk
factor for subsequent violent behavior by girls.
In the current sample of girls who were aged 9 through
15 years at baseline and followed up for 7 years, violent
behavior peaked at the age of 14 years. Other studies of
girls' violence have shown that rates of the most serious
self-reported violence by girls peaks about age 14 years
and then decline, except for a highly aggressive sub-
group.14,30,44 In this study, there was a steep decline in
the prevalence of girls' violent behavior between the base-

line interview (38%) and subsequent interviews (28% and
14%, waves 2 and 3, respectively). This decline echos the
decrease noted in other assessments of youth violence
in the United States during this period.8,13,14,45 The find-
ing that violently victimized girls show higher levels of
violence across all age groups indicates a need for early
intervention, as well as a possibility that early support
for girl survivors of violence would avert later aggres-
sion.
In this study, victimization might have happened at
home, at school, or in neighborhoods. One could argue
that both victimization and perpetration could have been
in the context of a single fight between youth. However,
we controlled for baseline factors that put youth in such
risky contexts, including illegal substance use, deviant
peer behaviors, girls' own previous violent behavior, and
neighborhood-level concentrated poverty. With these con-
trolled, the effects of prior victimization on girls' perpe-
tration of violence persisted over time, independent of
being in a peer group with norms of fighting and other
risky behaviors.
Studies of the relationship between sexual assault and
subsequent violent behavior are scarce in the literature;
only 2 previous studies with related findings were iden-
tified,46,47 both using cross-sectional, individual-level data.
One analyzed 1995 National College Health Risk Behav-
ior Survey data and found that lifetime forced sexual in-
tercourse among girls was associated with over twice the

odds of fighting with spouses or boyfriends in the 12
months prior to the survey.46 The second was a nation-
ally representative sample of students in grades 8 to 12
in France; this study found a significant relationship be-
tween rape and regular perpetration of violence in the
past year for both girls and boys.47 These findings sug-
gest that, from a clinical perspective, violence by girls may
serve as an indicator of need for interventions focused
on healing from sexual assault. Unfortunately, because
of the low prevalence of past-year reported sexual as-
sault among this sample of girls, we had to combine it
with other types of victimization, rather than evaluate this
relationship separately.
In addition to suggesting the potential importance of
early interventions for victimized children and adoles-
cents, results of the current inquiry suggest that a much
stronger emphasis on safety for children in their neigh-
borhoods, schools, and families would yield the largest
reduction in youth violence. To restrict the focus to in-
dividual interventions alone will leave those in unsafe set-
tings with correspondingly poor outcomes.
STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
Limitations
This study relied primarily on girls' self-reports. These
may have been subject to social desirability bias if girls
exaggerated aggressive behaviors or were reluctant to dis-
close victimization experiences, especially sexual as-
sault. With the longitudinal design, we also had missing
data that resulted in the deletion of respondents from the
analysis. This may have resulted in the introduction of
additional bias since removed subjects were more likely
to report deviant peers, less likely to have married care-
givers, and more likely to have a higher rate of baseline
violence. Additionally, the steep decline in perpetration
of violence across the 3 waves of data resulted in a low
prevalence of the outcome, which may have affected sta-
tistical power to detect associations prospectively.48 For
example, we expected to see an association between par-
ent-to-child physical aggression49 and subsequent vio-
lent behavior, but this was the case only at baseline. Fi-
nally, although the propensity score analysis allowed us
to account for many potential confounders, there is a pos-
sibility that there were unmeasured confounders that were
not included in the analysis.
Strengths
A major strength of this study is its multilevel, longitu-
dinal design. Prospective designs are particularly impor-
tant in assessing exposures to or experiences with vio-
lence across multiple settings, especially when studying
adolescence, a time of so many developmental changes.
The focus on perpetration by girls also is significant, given
the relatively scant literature on the origin of girls' ag-
gression using population-based samples. Finally, we used
multilevel methods to evaluate the independent contri-
bution of neighborhood effects on girls' violence, includ-
ing their interactions with individual exposure to vio-
lent victimization.
IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH
AND PREVENTION
Knowledge of mechanisms by which victimization and
exposure to neighborhood violence affects perpetration
by youth is as yet unrefined. Turner and Lloyd,50 dis-
cussing their findings on the effects of multiple traumas
for a child, suggest that one mechanism may be impair-
ment of the development of coping skills to deal with
stressors. Some theorists posit a social learning model in
which adolescents learn from others that violent behav-
ior is normative51,52; others offer biosocial explanations
for the development of youth violence.3
Current youth violence prevention efforts focus pri-
marily on intervention at the individual level: counsel-
ing for children or teens who demonstrate problems, pun-
ishment for children as individuals, attributions of adult
intentions or characteristics to children, and applica-
tion of adult remedies. In contrast, successful interven-
tions, to the extent that they have been evaluated, in-
clude multilevel interventions integrating family, school,
and community-level efforts.53 Our results suggest that
a continued emphasis on individual-based remedies or
penalties will be unsuccessful unless additional efforts
are undertaken to reduce childhood victimization and im-
prove the conditions in which many urban girls live.
