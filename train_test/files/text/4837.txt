Abstract
Objective: To determine the relationships between serum leptin and levels of lipoprotein(a)
[Lp(a)], apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in patients with cholelithiasis.
Methods: Patients with ultrasound-confirmed cholelithiasis and controls frequency-matched for
age, sex, body mass index, fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c
levels were recruited. Fasting
blood samples from all study participants were assayed for glucose, haemoglobin A1c,
total
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride. Serum Lp(a), ApoA-1
and ApoB levels were measured using nephelometric assays; serum leptin was measured using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: A total of 90 patients with cholelithiasis and 50 controls were included in the study.
Serum levels of leptin, Lp(a), total cholesterol, triglyceride and ApoB were significantly increased,
and levels of ApoA-1 and HDL-C were significantly decreased, in patients with cholelithiasis
compared with controls. Serum leptin in patients with cholelithiasis were significantly positively
correlated with Lp(a) and ApoB and negatively correlated with ApoA-1.
Conclusions: Patients with cholelithiasis have higher leptin levels and an altered lipoprotein
profile compared with controls, with increased leptin levels being associated with increased Lp(a)
and ApoB levels, and decreased ApoA-1 levels, in those with cholelithiasis.

Introduction
Gallstone-related disease is an important
and costly healthcare problem in Western
societies.1 Gallstones are common, with a
prevalence as high as 10­15% in Europe and
3­11% in Asia.2,3 Cholesterol gallstone
formation is a complex process that is
mediated by genetic and environmental
factors. Cholesterol gallstones are induced
by an imbalance of cholesterol metabolism
that involves changes in intestinal
absorption, hepatic biosynthesis and biliary
output of cholesterol and its conversion to
bile acids.2,4 Gallstone risk factors include
female sex, obesity, ageing, diabetes melli-
tus, hypertriglyceridaemia, insulin resist-
ance, oestrogen therapy and ethnicity.2­4
The three major factors in the pathogenesis
of cholelithiasis are gallbladder dysmotility,
cholesterol supersaturation of the bile and
cholesterol nucleation.2,3 Multiple associ-
ations between gallstones and dyslipidae-
mia,4­6 coronary artery disease7 and stroke8
have been reported. Gallbladder disease has
been shown to be associated with heightened
fasting serum insulin levels in women.9,10
Hyperinsulinaemia increases hepatic
cholesterol excretion and biliary cholesterol
supersaturation, and induces gallbladder
dysmotility; insulin resistance has been
shown to be associated with cholelithiasis
in nondiabetic, nonobese individuals.11
Leptin, a 16 kDa nonglycosylated
polypeptide product of the ob gene, is an
adipose tissue-derived hormone and is con-
sidered to be one of the major regulators of
food intake and energy metabolism.12 It is
secreted from the gastrointestinal tract, with
the epithelium of the stomach being a major
source of leptin production.13 Leptin is
stable in the stomach despite the acidic pH;
from there it passes on into the intestine.
Leptin receptors have been identified from
the duodenum to the colon in the basolateral
membrane of enterocytes and colonocytes,
suggesting a role for leptin in the gastro-
intestinal tract.14 Leptin receptors have also
been identified in the enteric nervous
system.15 Leptin has been shown to modu-
late nutrient absorption, growth, inflamma-
tion and gut motility.16 Abnormal leptin
levels and hyperinsulinaemia are important
risk factors for gallbladder disease.17,18 High
plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations and
low plasma high-density lipoprotein-choles-
terol (HDL-C) concentrations have been
associated with a greater risk of gallstone
disease.4 Cholesterol saturation of the bile is
heightened when the serum TG concentra-
tion is high, whereas the serum concentra-
tion of HDL-C is inversely correlated with
gallstone prevalence and cholesterol satur-
ation of bile.4,19 The present study aimed to
determine the relationships between serum
leptin and levels of the lipoproteins lipopro-
tein(a), apolipoprotein A-1 and apolipopro-
tein B in patients with cholelithiasis.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients with gallstones attending the
Department of General Surgery and the
Department of Clinical Biochemistry,
Faculty of Medicine, Dicle University,
Diyarbakir, Turkey, between November
2008 and December 2010, were recruited to
the study. Patients with acute cholecystitis,
biliary colic, acute infection of the biliary tract,
haemolytic disease, acute pancreatitis, viral or
alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease,
endocrine, renal, lung or coronary heart dis-
ease and those following restrictive diets were
excluded from the study. Patients who had
previously undergone cholecystectomy due to
gallstone disease at the same institution were
also recruited to the study group. Prolidase
levels were measured and planned to be
reported elsewhere (not submitted yet).
As increasing age, female sex, obesity
and prediabetes are risk factors for gallstones
and have a major influence on lipid levels,
and obesity is also a determinant of leptin
levels, a matching procedure was employed
386 Journal of International Medical Research 43(3)
to avoid confounding. Patients with gall-
stone disease were matched with controls
according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI,
calculated as body weight in kg divided by
height in m), fasting blood glucose and
haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c
) levels using the
frequency matching method.
The study protocol was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Dicle University
Faculty of Medicine and all study procedures
were in accordance with the ethical standards
for human experimentation established by
the Declaration of Helsinki. All study par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Patient assessment
A medical history was obtained from
all study participants and physical
examination, biochemical evaluation and
upper abdominal ultrasonography were per-
formed. The presence of intraluminal echo-
genicity with posterior acoustic shadowing
was considered to indicate gallstones. All
ultrasonographic studies were evaluated by
the same radiologist (A.B.).
Biochemical assessment
Bloodsamples(10ml)weretakenfromallstudy
participants at 09.00h after a 12-h overnight
fast and were immediately centrifuged for
10min at 3000g at 4C. The resulting serum
was stored at À70C until analysed. Glucose
andHbA1c
assayswereperformedusingstand-
ard laboratory methods. Serum levels of total
cholesterol, HDL-C and TG were determined
using an AerosetÕ autoanalyser (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Serum levels of apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-
1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were
measured by nephelometric assays using anti-
serum specific for ApoA-1 and ApoB (Dade
Behring, Newark, DE, USA), respectively.
The serum leptin level was measured using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
(Leptin ELISA, DRG International,
Springfield, NJ, USA); the limit of detection
was 0.2 ng/ml. Lipoprotein-a (Lp[a]) was
measured using a nephelometric agglutination
assay (N Latex Lp[a] Reagent, Dade Behring).
The intra- and interassay coefficients of vari-
ations were 1.5­3.0% (n ¼ 20) and 1.7­3.2%
(n ¼ 10), respectively; the lower detection limit
was 30 mg/l.
Statistical analyses
Results were expressed as the mean Æ SD.
The unpaired Student's t-test was used to
compare the cholelithiasis and control
groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient
was used to estimate the linear relation-
ships between the variables studied. A
P-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-
tically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ software, ver-
sion 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 140 participants (92 women and 48
men) were included in the study. Of these,
50 were healthy controls (32 women and
18 men; mean age Æ SD, 47.2Æ 8.23years),
and 90 were patients with cholelithiasis
(60 women and 30 men; mean age Æ SD,
48.1 Æ 9.7 years). Because of the matching
criteria, there were no statistically significant
differences between the groups in terms of
age, sex, BMI, fasting blood glucose or
HbA1c
levels.
Demographic and clinical characteristics
of the study participants are given in Table 1.
Serum HDL-C and ApoA-1 levels were
significantly lower in patients with cholelith-
iasis than in healthy controls (P < 0.001),
whereas serum levels of total cholesterol, TG,
ApoB, Lp(a) and leptin were significantly
higher in patients with cholelithiasis than in
healthy controls (P < 0.001) (Table 1).
In patients with cholelithiasis, serum
leptin levels were positively correlated with
serum levels of Lp(a) (r ¼ 0.952, P < 0.001;
Sarac
¸ et al. 387
data not shown) and ApoB (r ¼ 0.918,
P < 0.001, Figure 1), and negatively corre-
lated with serum levels of ApoA-1
(r ¼ À0.785, P < 0.001, Figure 2).
Discussion
Leptin, a hormone produced by adipocytes,
is known to have central effects on neuro-
peptide Y and cholecystokinin, but its
influence on the biliary effects of these
hormones is unknown.20 Obese, leptin-defi-
cient mice have large gallbladder volumes
with decreased contraction in vitro, and are
predisposed to cholesterol crystal forma-
tion.20 Administrating leptin to these mice
caused weight loss, restored gallbladder
function, upregulated cholecystokinin A
receptors, acetylcholine b2 receptors and
Ca2þ/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase,
and downregulated 3-hydroxy 3-methylglu-
taryl coenzyme A reductase and low-density
lipoprotein receptors.21 A previous study
showed that leptin-deficient obese mice had
decreased excitatory gallbladder muscle
contractile responses to acetylcholine,
neuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin.20
Leptin seems to potentiate the effect of
cholecystokinin. Leptin signalling in vagal
afferent neurons is required for appropriate
cholecystokinin signalling and satiation.22
De Lartigue and coworkers23 showed that
leptin resistance reduced the sensitivity of
vagal afferent neurons to cholecystokinin,
thus reducing the satiating effects of chole-
cystokinin. In addition to regulating vagal
afferent nerve discharge, cholecystokinin
controls the expression of receptors and
peptide neurotransmitters by these neurons;
these regulatory actions are potentiated by
leptin and inhibited by ghrelin.24 Florian
and coworkers16 showed that leptin modu-
lated the activity of enteric inhibitory and
excitatory neurons in the proximal colon. As
leptin seems to have a regulatory function in
gastrointestinal motility, the present study
evaluated leptin levels in patients with
cholelithiasis and found that leptin levels
were increased in cholelithiasis compared
with controls. There were significant positive

correlations between serum leptin and ApoB
and Lp(a) and a significant negative correl-
ation between serum leptin and ApoA-1 in
patients with cholelithiasis. These findings
could be useful in understanding the patho-
physiology of cholelithiasis. The results of
the present study are consistent with those of
previous studies showing elevated leptin
levels17,25 and an abnormal lipid pro-
file,5,17,19,26 with higher total cholesterol,
TG, ApoB and Lp(a) and lower HDL-C
and ApoA-1 levels in patients with chole-
lithiasis compared with healthy controls. In
contrast, some studies have reported no
difference in leptin18 and lipoprotein
levels18,25,27,28 in patients with cholelithiasis
compared with controls.
Me
´ ndez-Sa
´ nchez et al.17 reported that
insulin resistance and the development of
gallstone disease were associated with serum
leptin levels in overweight subjects
(BMI < 30 kg/m2), but not in obese subjects
(BMI ! 30 kg/m2) with similar metabolic
profiles. Insulin resistance could have a
major role in the pathogenesis of gallstones,
favouring the production of cholesterol-
supersaturated bile and altering gallbladder
function. In another study, Me
´ ndez-Sa
´ nchez
et al.19 found a negative correlation between
leptin and HDL-C levels. Duggirala et al.29

cholelithiasis.
Sarac
¸ et al. 389
reported that leptin levels correlated signifi-
cantly with the incidence of gallstones in a
low-income Mexican­American population,
especially in women. However, Ruhl and
Everhart30 found that the serum leptin
level was not a better predictor of gall-
stone disease than anthropometry. A signifi-
cant and positive correlation between
leptin levels and biliary cholesterol
saturation in obese subjects has been
reported.19 Me
´ ndez-Sa
´ nchez et al.17 found
a strong relationship between gallstone dis-
ease and the metabolic syndrome, which has
the cardinal feature of hyperinsulinaemia.
They also demonstrated the existence of
relationships between serum HDL-C, the
biliary cholesterol saturation index and
serum leptin levels in obese subjects.19 In
the present study, lower HDL-C and
ApoA-1 levels but higher Lp(a) and ApoB
levels were observed in patients with chole-
lithiasis compared with controls. Previous
studies have suggested that leptin promotes
the elimination of serum cholesterol by
increasing cholesterol secretion, decreasing
cholesterol biosynthesis and increasing con-
version of cholesterol to bile salts, whereas
obesity and the chronic effect of leptin
resistance impair the function of biliary
cholesterol secretion.18,19 Graewin et al.21
reported that leptin modulated obesity
and regulated gallbladder genes related to
cholesterol gallstone pathogenesis. Tran
et al.31 reported that hyperglycaemia, insulin
resistance, hyperlipidaemia and body weight
in obese mice with leptin dysfunction

cholelithiasis.

were associated with poor gallbladder con-
tractility, which in turn may contribute to the
association between obesity and gallstone
formation. They also found an inverse cor-
relation between gallbladder contractility
and serum glucose, insulin, cholesterol, TG
and body weight.31 Nakeeb et al.32 suggested
that insulin resistance alone might be respon-
sible for gallbladder dysmotility, resulting in
gallstone formation. Gallbladder motility has
been shown to be impaired in subjects with
hypertriglyceridaemia, compared with BMI-
matched controls.17
In summary, the results of the present
study revealed significant relationships
between serum leptin and Lp(a), ApoB
and ApoA-1 levels in patients with cholelith-
iasis. These findings support the hypothesis
of altered biliary cholesterol metabolism,
characterized by lower ApoA-1 and higher
ApoB serum concentrations in cholelithiasis.
Patients with cholelithiasis have higher leptin
levels and an altered lipoprotein profile
compared with controls, with increased
leptin levels being associated with increased
Lp(a) and ApoB levels and decreased ApoA-
1 levels in those with cholelithiasis.
