Article
Doctoral student attrition rates have raised concerns, as only
half of admitted doctoral students graduate within the nomi-
nal period of time (see Gardner, 2009; Vassil & Solvak,
2012). Higher education reforms and the recent economic
crises have put pressure on institutions to increase graduate
rates and shorten the time it takes to be awarded a degree.
The arguments supporting this are connected to limited
financial resources, and that long, intense, or complicated
study periods can be emotionally draining for both doctoral
students and their families (Bair & Haworth, 2004).
Despite an increasing number of studies, student attrition
rates remain high in several countries (Clarke & Lunt, 2014),
including Estonia (Vassil & Solvak, 2012), the latter being
the context of the current study. The problem is especially
serious in Estonia, because despite the set target of 300 new
doctoral graduates per academic year (Eesti teadus- ja aren-
dustegevuse . . . , 2014) and an overall upward trend in the
number of students completing their doctoral studies, the
annual increase of PhD degree holders is still one third
smaller than planned (approximately, 200 defenses of doc-
toral theses a year; Haridussilm, 2015).
Given an increasing societal need for PhD degree holders
to help alter Estonia's economic structure and meet societal
requirements, the lack of doctoral students reaching gradua-
tion is a cause for concern. It is, therefore, essential to deter-
mine what is causing low on-time graduation rates and high
attrition rates and what could be done to ensure a sufficient
output of PhD degree holders.
Studies that examined doctoral student attrition high-
light two main groups of associating factors: (a) personal
and (b) environmental (Bair & Haworth, 2004; Latona &
Browne, 2001; Leijen, Lepp, & Remmik, 2015). In this
study, we focused on the latter group of factors. More spe-
cifically, we investigated the perspectives of doctoral
supervisors and supervisory arrangements in connection to
doctoral students' study stalls and graduation efficiency. It
is important to note that supervisors cannot be observed in
isolation from their doctoral students or environmental
factors.
We first present the results of a literature review and
reflect on the factors that influence the course of doctoral
students' studies, with the focus on the reasons for doctoral
students' study stalls and dropouts. In addition, we provide
a brief overview of studies that focused on the reasons for
and types of intervention strategies applied by doctoral
supervisors.

Doctoral Students' Research Stall:
Supervisors' Perceptions and
Intervention Strategies

Abstract
We explored doctoral supervisors' explanations for students' lack of progress toward gaining their degree and describe
the activities that supervisors said they take on such occasions. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews from
21 supervisors specializing in the fields of natural and educational sciences and then analyzed using thematic analysis. The
results indicated that supervisors communicated understanding about the stalling of studies. The supervisors noted that it
is important that students have the knowledge and skills suitable to maintain progress toward their degree. However, the
supervisors indicated that successful progress depends on a student's initiative to ask for help, believing that because the
student is an adult learner, they should be intrinsically motivated. Consequently, supervisors often adopt a wait-and-see
attitude in terms of their intervention strategy.

Literature Review
Universities have sharpened their focus on the quality of
doctoral studies to enhance their understanding of the factors
that influence the timely completion of a degree. The under-
lying factors are complex and intertwined (Lovitts, 2001;
Manathunga, 2002; Pole, Sprokkereef Burgess, & Lakin,
1997), and no "single recipe" leads to successful completion
for all doctoral students. Previous studies (see Bair &
Haworth, 2004) have distinguished two mutually influencing
factors affecting doctoral students' study progression: (a)
student-related factors (student cohorts and characteristics;
that is, personal context) and (b) environmental factors (insti-
tutional and structural contexts, including those related to
supervision).
Student-Related Factors
According to Bair and Haworth's (2004) meta-analysis of
118 research studies regarding doctoral students' attrition,
there are several important student-related personal factors
that seem to correlate with PhD students' persistence with
their studies: intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, goal direct-
edness, positive self-concept, and well-being. In addition, it
has been indicated (e.g., by Lovitts, 2001) that personal char-
acteristics such as intelligence, knowledge (both formal and
informal), and thinking style are also key factors influencing
degree completion. For instance, Lovitts (2001) found that
supervisors consider it important to find "the right doctoral
students who are well suited for the doctoral studies" (p. 21).
"The right doctoral student" is, in addition to the already
mentioned factors, also characterized by academic capabil-
ity. When a student stalls or discontinues their study, a super-
visor considers critical thinking skills and/or academic
writing skills a shortcoming (D'Andrea, 2002; Lovitts, 2001;
Leijen et al., 2015).
Doctoral students'study progress has been associated with
self-sabotaging behaviors that lead to activities hindering aca-
demic progress (Kearns, Gardiner, & Marshall, 2008). For
instance, Kearns et al. (2008) found several self-sabotaging
behaviors of doctoral students during their studies: (a) over-
committing--where a doctoral student takes on too many
responsibilities and high-priority goals such as writing their
doctoral thesis suffer; (b) business--a doctoral student deals
with minor duties and leaves the impression that they cannot
deal with their doctoral thesis; (c) disorganization--a doc-
toral student lacks a system and routine that would contribute
to an optimal use of their time; (d) effort--a doctoral student
does not make sufficient effort; and (e) performance-debili-
tating circumstances--a doctoral student tries to work in an
unsuitable (e.g., noisy) place. Self-sabotaging behaviors can
also include: (f) excessive perfectionism--a doctoral student
sets unrealistic and unnaturally high expectations for them-
selves and their work and (g) procrastination--a situation that
Rothblum, Solomon, and Murakami (1986) define as the
"tendency to always or nearly always put off academic tasks,
and always or nearly always experience problematic anxiety
associated with this procrastination" (p. 387). Procrastination
has been considered as one of the most common self-sabotag-
ing behaviors (Kearns et al., 2008).
Ahern and Manathunga (2004) have described blocks (the
reasons for study stall) in three domains: (a) cognitive--for
example, a doctoral student lacks the necessary knowledge
and skills for writing a doctoral thesis, but does not have the
courage to admit it to their supervisor; (b) affective--a doc-
toral student's self-esteem is poor; performance anxiety is a
widespread problem; and (c) social--a doctoral student has a
weak connection with the department's research culture. It is
important to note that many student procrastination factors
are interrelated.
Several studies (e.g., Lovitts, 2001; Nelson, Dell'Oliver,
Koch, & Buckler, 2001; Smith, Maroney, Nelson, Abel, &
Abel, 2006) have also described student-related interper-
sonal factors such as (a) support systems, for example, loved
ones who provide important environments of acceptance and
understanding during the study period; (b) family responsi-
bilities and relationships with significant others, and the time
spent away from family can create feelings of guilt and anxi-
ety, which in turn can create stress that leads to discontinua-
tion (Smith et al., 2006); and (c) employment responsibilities
and financial strain, which have been associated with time
constraints and work overload. According to Tinto (1993),
the amount of financial aid shapes a PhD student's participa-
tion in the program to a great degree, as time spent by stu-
dents on supporting themselves financially equals less time
spent on the demands of their candidature. In general, how-
ever, the authors of this article tend to agree that the advance-
ment of PhD students and the success or discontinuation of
doctoral studies are influenced by many interrelated factors.
Environmental Factors Affecting Progress
In addition to students' personal factors, PhD studies are
also affected by the study environment, with all its regula-
tions and requirements; the domain-specific traditions in
use; and the people who create the environment and affect
the functioning in it (Pyhältö, Stubb, & Lonka, 2009). In
spite of the harmonizing impact of the Bologna reform
movement in Europe, higher education and doctoral stud-
ies are nevertheless characterized by considerable diver-
sity in organizational policies and procedures across
different countries within Europe, universities within the
same country, faculties/institutes within the same univer-
sity, and disciplines. Universities set the minimum criteria
and requirements for graduate students and programs,
while departments control admission, the curricula, degree
requirements, and student training, which in turn enables
departments to organize graduate education to fit the cul-
ture of their discipline (Crosier, Purser, & Smidt, 2007).
Hence, doctoral studies, doctoral students, and doctoral
Lepp et al. 3
supervisors are all influenced by and affect the research
climate; the social practices of the scholarly community
(Lovitts, 2001).
Supervisors and Supervision
Supervisors significantly influence the time needed to attain
a degree and doctoral graduation rates (Lee, 2008; Zhao,
Golde, & McCormick, 2007). Few empirical studies
(Manathunga, 2002, 2005) report on the activities of supervi-
sors or their explanations for these activities when dealing
with stalled PhD studies. The current study fills this gap by
examining PhD supervisors' experiences.
According to Kam (1997), the "quality of research super-
vision is a subjective construct--the perceived satisfaction
of the student with the supervisory process and practice"
(p. 82). Advice must be tailored to the needs of the particular
student (Barnes & Austin, 2009). In spite of this personalized
nature and while there can be no single recipe for successful
supervision, numerous sources have suggested several gen-
eral principles of good supervision. Latona and Browne
(2001), for example, outlined a number of supervisor activi-
ties and responsibilities related to good supervisory practice
as follows: open and dynamic negotiation of mutual expecta-
tions and responsibilities, supportive and collegial relation-
ships with students, encouraging students to start early on
their topics, encouraging students not to change topics, con-
tinuity in supervision; frequent meetings with PhD students,
and targeted and timely feedback.
Although supervision has been thoroughly examined
from different aspects, there is little research on how super-
visors identify factors that hinder doctoral students' studies
and what they, as supervisors, do on such occasions.
Manathunga (2005) investigated the cues that highly effec-
tive supervisors use to stay alert to their students' research
progress. These supervisors identified warning signs cen-
tered on four key types of doctoral student behavior: (a)
constantly changing the topic or planned work, (b) avoiding
all forms of communication with the supervisor, (c) isolat-
ing themselves from the school and other students, and (d)
avoiding submitting work for review. Manathunga's study
also offers several strategies to recognize these warning
signs and develop effective interventions. First, it is impor-
tant to establish and build a supportive relationship between
PhD student and supervisor, thereby facilitating the sharing
of concerns and hesitations by the students. Second, fre-
quent and individual supervision through regular meetings
where the supervisor systematically monitors the student's
progress and where necessary intervenes. Third, provide
pedagogical focus and scaffolding through direct teaching if
and when the doctoral student needs it.
Manathunga (2005) also notes the importance of supervi-
sors to model the research process by encouraging students to
ask questions and build their research confidence in the pro-
cess. This supports Lee's (2008) suggestion that a significant
supervision success factor is "functional supervision" (p. 271)
characterized by goal orientation and efficient process and
time management. Lee also stipulates that a doctoral student's
emancipation, where the supervisor pays attention to the stu-
dent's personal development and growth, is also necessary.
Hence, the supervisor is seen as a "clutch starter" for their
stalled students (Ahern & Manathunga, 2004, p. 237). This
requires that supervisors are able to recognize when their stu-
dents stall, can determine the causes of the stall, and provide
encouragement and support so the student can move forward
again. It has, however, been noted that not all supervisors are
able or willing to watch for warning signs and to help students
throughdifficulties(Ahern&Manathunga,2004;Manathunga,
2005).
The aim of this study was to describe doctoral supervi-
sors' explanations for the stall of doctoral students' studies
and the activities that supervisors say they take on such occa-
sions. The following research questions were formulated for
the empirical study:
Research Question 1: Which factors are perceived by
supervisors as contributing to the stall of the doctoral
study process?
Research Question 2: Which strategies do supervisors
claim to use to assist PhD students through difficulties,
and which explanation do they give to these?
In this article, we view stall of studies to be situations
where there is lack of progress, that is, a doctoral student
does not progress with their studies at a pace considered suf-
ficient by the supervisor (Ahern & Manathunga, 2004).
Context of Doctoral Studies in Estonia
At Estonian universities, the standard period for a doctoral
study is 4 years, during which 240 European Credit Transfer
and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits must be earned by
the doctoral student. To be more exact, during a doctoral
study, 60 ECTS are earned for specialty, elective, and
optional subjects, and 180 ECTS for the dissertation writing
process. One credit in Estonia corresponds to 26 hr of study.
There are two options for meeting the requirement of
completing a doctoral dissertation: A student can write a
monograph or a dissertation based on a collection of pub-
lished articles. In the case of the monograph, the student
must have published at least one article in an international
peer-reviewed journal or a publication by an international
academic publisher. The dissertation is generally written and
defended in English (which for most PhD students is their
first or second foreign language besides their mother tongue,
Estonian). A dissertation based on a collection of articles
requires three articles that are published in international
peer-reviewed journals and an overview article that com-
bines the published articles into a complete dissertation (see
more in the summary, by Eamets et al., 2014).
4 SAGE Open
In Estonia, doctoral education is financed by the state,
meaning students have no fees (Universities Act, 2015). In
2015, a doctoral allowance of 422 per month was estab-
lished for full-time PhD students during the nominal study
period. In comparison, the average monthly salary in Estonia
in 2014 was 1,005 (Economy in Numbers, 2015).
Eamets et al. (2014), in their study of Estonian doctoral
students, stated that about one third of Estonian doctoral stu-
dents work part-time, 35% work full-time, and 14% maintain
that they work overtime. Supervising a doctoral student is a
faculty obligation; however, supervisors have not been
required to pass any compulsory course on supervision.
Method
Participants and Data Collection
To identify the factors that influence the advancement of
PhD students, the actions supervisors take when students'
studies stall and the discontinuation of students' studies, 21
PhD supervisors (six in the natural sciences and 15 in the
educational sciences) from two research-intensive universi-
ties in Estonia were interviewed between 2011 and 2013
using a semi-structured format.
The motive for including supervisors from both the natu-
ral sciences as well as the educational sciences was related to
variations in (a) graduation rates and (b) the progress of PhD
students. Namely, doctoral students in the natural sciences
tend to advance quicker in their studies than students from
the educational sciences (see Eesti Kõrghariduse
Kvaliteediagentuur, 2011; Lepp, Remmik, Karm, & Leijen,
2013). Furthermore, Golde (2005) states that due to the influ-
ence a discipline can have on the overall study experience of
a PhD student, it is relevant to conduct studies on doctoral
education from the perspectives of varied disciplines.
The majority of the supervisors participating in the study
were either senior lecturers or professors. At the time the cur-
rent study was carried out, 77 PhD students had defended
their dissertations (29 in educational science and 48 in natu-
ral science), and 16 students had discontinued their studies
under the supervision of the participants in the study.
Data Collection
Semi-structured interviews with doctoral supervisors were
conducted. The aim and research questions of the current
study, as well as some earlier studies (e.g., Lee, 2008;
Sinclair, 2004), were used as a basis for formulating the
interview questions. To first identify the influences supervi-
sors find as being conducive to study stall, and second the
actions supervisors themselves commonly take in such cases,
the following main themes were included in the interview
questions: supervisors' descriptions of their regular supervi-
sory practices, supervisors' conceptions of the factors that
lead to doctoral students'study stall and discontinuation, and
the actions supervisors take in the case of study stall. For
instance, the participants were asked to describe their com-
mon supervisory actions, to give their opinion about the
causes of doctoral students' study stall and discontinuation,
to talk about their experience and actions (as well as giving
reasons for these) related to PhD students who either drop
out of sight for a while or entirely, to describe some of the
most serious cases, and to explain when, how, and why they
as supervisors intervene. The abovementioned questions
served as a starting point from which additional detailed
questions--concerning the instances mentioned by the
supervisors--followed. A pilot interview with one supervi-
sor was conducted, after which the main interviews followed
with a slightly modified interview guide. See Lepp (2015),
for the complete guide to the interview.
An interview lasted for approximately 90 min, with the
length of interviews ranging from 70 to 115 min. All the
interviews were audio-recorded. Participation of the supervi-
sors was voluntary.
Data Analysis
All interviews were transcribed unabridged. Pseudonyms were
assigned to the participants and people mentioned during the
interviews. Braun and Clarke's (2006) six phase thematic anal-
ysis model was used to analyze the interviews after the tran-
scripts had been entered into the computer program QCAmap.
Apreliminary analysis was conducted by two researchers, who
then exchanged their materials and debated the results at differ-
ent stages of the analysis (Mayring, 2014).
First, all the transcripts were read and commented on to
become familiarized with the data set. Based on the research
questions, preliminary lists of notions about the data content
in the two focal areas were created by the researchers: (a) the
causes for doctoral students' study stall and discontinuation
and (b) the activities of doctoral supervisors in supporting
students in bridging their study stall or the idea to discon-
tinue their studies. Then what could be described as intrigu-
ing aspects in the data were identified and systematically
coded throughout. Next, after a discussion between the
researchers and an arrival at a consensus, these codes were
arranged under four central themes and sub-themes. To gain
a more visual overview, the researchers used the analysis as
a basis for drawing up a thematic map of the themes and sub-
themes, after which two other researchers assisted in estab-
lishing whether the coded excerpts from the interviews and
the entire data set were in agreement with the themes.
In cases where domain-specific differences in supervi-
sors' answers were noted, these differences were given spe-
cial attention by the research group--within the specific
theme or sub-theme--in the form of additional analysis and
discussion. For the purpose of increasing the reliability of the
data analysis, the researchers held reflective debates with the
aim of realizing a consensus in cases of disagreement (see
Eisner, 1991).
Lepp et al. 5
The research group determined four main and eight sub-
themes relevant from the perspective of the research ques-
tions. These four main themes were defined as follows: (a)
the possibility and necessity of completing the studies within
the nominal study period, (b) supervisor's activities to pre-
vent study stall, (c) supervisor's activities in cases of doctoral
student's study stall, and (d) supervisor's coping with the pro-
cess of doctoral student's study stall. These main themes and
their sub-themes were followed by results, which were sup-
ported by interview excerpts. The abbreviations ED and NA
stand for "supervisors from the educational sciences" and
"supervisors from the natural sciences," respectively.
Results
The Possibility and Necessity of Completing the
Studies Within the Nominal Study Period
Supervisors, in this study, saw the completion of a student's
studies within the nominal study period as not an end in
itself. They brought out the specificity of the domain, which
does not always enable fast results (e.g., researching people,
natural objects, or longitudinal studies). As Anne (ED)
explained,
When working with people, to develop something that would
also have let's say a scientific and practical relevance, then it is
practically impossible to complete this within four years.
Also, the long review process and time spent trying to
publish were brought out as a hindrance. In the field of edu-
cational science, the supervisors also mentioned lack of
funding as hindering the nominal process. Many doctoral
students work during their studies in positions not related to
their doctoral research and cannot proceed at the required
pace. According to most interviewees, completing a doctoral
study within 4 years is not necessarily the best option from
the perspective of the doctoral student's learning and devel-
opment. A longer study period and time spent in the aca-
demic community can help a doctoral student see the bigger
picture regarding their particular domain, as well as in
research in general. The supervisors found that where the
resources stretched further, the study period could be longer
than the nominal 4 years, as illustrated by Kristjan (NA):
It is not possible to plan science. Research advances as it
advances. In my head the plan is that they complete it in six
years, they could in four years as well, but each year longer
they're here the more they learn. So there's no rush, they have
another 30 years to work afterwards.
Supervisor's Activities to Prevent Study Stall
The supervisor's earlier collaboration with the future doctoral
student. Supervisors considered previous positive experiences
with supervisee(s), as well as any previous activity in the same
research field, as significant in influencing their cooperation
process. Previous experiences facilitated subsequent interac-
tions, resulting in a clear and more detailed overview of the
knowledge, skills, and personality traits and motivation of the
doctoral student. Several supervisors (mostly from the natural
sciences) expressed preparing possible doctoral students already
at previous study levels, as Kalle (NA) pointed out:
It's actually necessary to start grooming a good doctoral student
already in the first year of studies. In the first study years you
have to look and find the bright students, and then you actually
start grooming them.
In such cases, most supervisors expressed satisfaction
with their doctoral students in the subsequent process, as
Maria (ED) explains:
I know them, as they've been as my children from the baby
stages then well . . . I have no problems in supervising them
because I know how to supervise them.
Several ED admitted having accepted students with whom
they had no previous experience to a PhD study. In some
cases, the supervisors collected background information
about the candidate and were therefore better prepared for
further cooperation.
Finding sources for funding and thereby securing a doctoral
student's employment.The supervisors brought out that
resources provided by the university are essential in enabling
a PhD student to commit to their doctoral research and not
to work elsewhere. One of the activities of supervisees from
the natural sciences was to find sources of funding to create
a job in their research team for a doctoral student during the
study period. The availability of funding was also men-
tioned as a condition set by the faculty for enabling a super-
visor to take on a PhD student. Therefore, supervisors write
grant applications for projects and if given funding, can
employ a PhD student to their research team, as illustrated
by Heldur (NA):
The faculty sees if a supervisor has enough resources . . . which
grants and finances does he/she have and the infrastructure, the
existence of funding. It is the supervisor's responsibility. . . . If a
supervisor doesn't have the funds, they won't take on doctoral
students.
Only a few interviewees from the educational sciences
described finding sources of funding and including doctoral
students in research groups. It was often brought up that it is
difficult to get funding for research projects in the educa-
tional domain, and as a result, supervisors lack the financial
resources for employing doctoral students, as exemplified by
Sandra (ED):
6 SAGE Open
You proceed along as fast as you can and well, there's not much
financing and project funds anyway and so we practically
operate with our nonexistent finances solely on our brain
potential.
The supervisors in education sciences mainly expressed
the expectation that "funds should come from somewhere,"
but at the same time, they distanced themselves from finding
the sources for funding, as highlighted in the following
example:
Well I think that it is the lack of resources that makes them take
on a full-time job, that these kind of resources are not possible
and I don't see that kind of resource. (Karoliina; ED)
These results demonstrate the necessity for the supervisor
to find funding. Based on our interviews, the participants
from the natural sciences considered research to be a doc-
toral student's main job during their study period. The ED
mainly accepted the idea that the primary source of employ-
ment of a doctoral student lies elsewhere during their study
period, resulting in a prolonged study.
The responsibility of the admissions committee to select suitable
doctoral students. Several interviewees from the educational
sciences considered the role of the admissions committee to
be important in preventing stalling. The committee should
ascertain the knowledge and skills, personality traits, and
motivation of the potential doctoral student. Although most
of the interviewees were or had previously been members of
an admissions committee, it was brought out that the selec-
tion process had not always been sufficient. As a result, some
doctoral students among their previous and current supervis-
ees, and also in general, should not have been allowed onto a
doctoral study program. Some supervisors (from the educa-
tional sciences) expressed their dissatisfaction as follows:
"the level is low, not enough capable students; doctoral stu-
dents lack sufficient preparation" (Sander, ED); "most candi-
dates were weak and if we admit a lot of them then also the
research won't progress as it should; I'd like people with
more brain potential to come to this domain" (Vambola, ED).
A tighter selection procedure during the admission phase
could ensure better progress of doctoral students and also
facilitate the job of the supervisors during the subsequent
supervisory process, as is highlighted in the following
excerpts:
Implementation of the requirements should be stricter. The
requirements themselves are OK, but sometimes we're too soft.
. . . Our usual practice at the admissions committee: we do our
evaluation and then it turns out that most of the candidates fail,
and then we add 23 points to everyone and then we can admit the
required number of doctoral students. (Karla; ED)
On the contrary, the interviewees from the natural sci-
ences described the admissions committee's role in
preventing subsequent problems during the study period as
only a formality. Preparatory work with the doctoral stu-
dent was already organized, and the supervisor had ensured
funding to employ the doctoral student to their own
research group. As Heldur (NA) explains it,
There's a pre-selection taking place so that at the time of
admissions we don't have a line at the door. . . . We know which
project we have where we can admit a doctoral student, which
qualities are required for that and which qualities we need from
the student.
Supervisor's Activities in Cases of a Doctoral
Student's Study Stall
The data analysis revealed four broader sub-themes in the
descriptions of the supervisors, which according to them
explain why doctoral students stall their study: (a) shortcom-
ings in the doctoral student's academic preparation, (b) the
doctoral student's motivation and diligence, (c) personal
events in the doctoral student's life, and (d) the material
resources and time available to spend on doctoral research.
In the following section, we first describe in which situations
(if at all) the supervisors considered it necessary to contact
their students.
Noticing a stall and communicating with the doctoral student
during a break in their studies.Supervisors' descriptions of
situations where a doctoral student had been "out of sight for
a longer period," how the supervisor approached the student
to ascertain what the student was currently doing with regard
to their doctoral research, and what help they might need,
demonstrated that contact time between supervisor and stu-
dent differed among the supervisors. Busyness was frequently
named as a reason for not contacting a doctoral student ("Well
I have other work to do" [Karla, ED]). Another position taken
by some supervisors is that an adult pursuing a doctoral study
must be intrinsically motivated, be able to direct their studies,
and take responsibility for the process. Working indepen-
dently for long periods is how a doctoral student becomes an
independent researcher. It was found that asking doctoral stu-
dents about their research might be unpleasant, and therefore,
several of the supervisors thought it was better to wait until a
doctoral student is ready to consult with their supervisor, as
highlighted in the following excerpts:
I think that it's unpleasant to the person when I keep asking all
the time . . . I think that it makes them feel bad and so I just wait
until the person comes and shows their work. (Anna; ED)
ED believed that doctoral students get into contact when
they have questions or when they have time aside from their
other work commitments and personal life.
NA described that it is not possible in their domain that
people get out of sight for long periods of time as everyone is
Lepp et al. 7
consistently working in a team. There is a work-related
employer­employee relationship with the supervisee, thus, a
doctoral student needs to earn their living by doing their stud-
ies. If the doctoral student is not prepared, then the collabora-
tion is ended, as the following example clearly illustrates:
If a person wants help, I help them, but I'm not going to pull
someone who's lazy, stupid and careless through all this. . . . So
in that sense the aim of my activity is definitely not that someone
must receive a doctoral degree. . . . My way is either you lead,
you follow or you get lost. (Uku; NA)
Shortcomings in a doctoral student's academic preparation.The
supervisors considered the lack of methodological knowl-
edge, an insufficient level of English, and poor academic
writing skills to be the main shortcomings of doctoral stu-
dents associated with stalling.
Methodology.Supervisors mostly expected that a doc-
toral student received sufficient preparation in the relevant
methodology during previous study levels. Increasing their
knowledge of methodology continues during the doctoral
study in relation to the research topic by consulting with spe-
cialists and or via courses and training.
A domain-specific difference appeared with the inter-
viewees from the natural sciences, who deemed it common
practice that a doctoral student includes specialists in the
data analysis process and that a doctoral student does not
learn to perform all the details of data analysis themselves, as
highlighted by Kristjan (NA):
We have very complicated data analyses and well then we have
to do it together with statisticians who are separate people for
that.
It was highlighted that methodological questions and dif-
ficulties are also discussed in research groups and that doc-
toral students in research groups also teach their peers.
In the educational sciences data, supervisees are advised
to attend methodology courses and learn how to analyze
data. It was, however, mentioned that doctoral students do
not always use this knowledge in their research work, as
illustrated by Vambola (ED):
They take some statistics course and learn everything there,
solve some exercises and then when they need to use it at work
they can't do it . . . and we're back at the beginning.
Academic writing. The majority of the supervisors consid-
ered the writing skills of PhD students to be problematic.
It was mentioned that doctoral students have problems with
synthesizing sources in their dissertation. In addition, doc-
toral students often struggle writing the discussion part of
articles. According to the supervisors, weak academic writ-
ing skills increase the workload of supervisors, as poorly
written manuscripts need thorough and repeated feedback.
Mainly the NA added that doctoral students are included
to write joint articles with members of the research group
already at the beginning of their studies. According to some,
academic writing needs to be directly taught to doctoral stu-
dents, as Maria (ED) explained:
I tried to explain to them that the overview of the literature needs
to be a kind of synthesis, but they had still just copied and pasted
segments from the sources. . . . I tried to create a sort of a
structure for them.
English language skills. Insufficient knowledge of English
was also brought out as a hindrance to the study progress.
The English language skills of younger doctoral students
were, however, considered to be much better--as they have
had a better language preparation at school--than those
schooled during the Soviet era. In the occurrence of language
problems, doctoral students were generally advised to attend
courses. In cases where insufficient language skills hindered
study progress, the supervisors helped their students to find
translators and language editors and ways to finance the
involved costs.
Doctoral student's motivation and diligence.Motivation, dili-
gence, and persistence were also considered important fac-
tors for the progression of studies. Motivated doctoral
students were described as persons who are interested in
their research topic and who have the ability to purposefully
and intently work on it. The interviewees emphasized that a
person studying at doctoral level must be consistent and very
patient. A doctoral student has to know how to commit to
long-term goals even when experiencing setbacks and hesi-
tations along the way, as Uku (NA) vividly explained:
Mental abilities are not enough for doing science, you must have
an ability to work, you need to have patience. . . . It's like with
pregnancy, you can do whatever you want during these nine
months, but you cannot make the normal pregnancy move along
any faster, you have to wait the nine months, can't make it any
faster.
When the supervisors noticed that a doctoral student has
motivation issues and or has informed the supervisor that
they wish to discontinue their studies, they talk to the student
and try to help the student see the longer term goals, as the
following example clearly illustrates:
I try to convince them by telling them to hang on in there for
another few years, and then they have a doctoral degree that feeds
them for life. No one can take it from them, and then they realize
that they need to think about their life over the next 30 years and
perhaps it's useful to get the degree, after all. (Kristjan; NA)
The interviewees noted that a doctoral student is only
convinced to continue with their studies in cases where the
supervisor still has faith in their abilities and the possibility
8 SAGE Open
of them completing their studies. The supervisors added that
in cases they doubt whether a student's academic skills and
diligence are sufficient to complete their study, they stop
motivating the student. In addition, the supervisors were
mostly of the opinion that doctoral students are adult learners
who themselves decide to continue or discontinue, as Uno
(ED) pointed out during his interview:
I'm not a babysitter. A PhD student is an adult after all, and I'm
just a helper. I've never gone looking for anyone at their home
or something and if they don't do [their research] then so be it.
Personal events in a doctoral student's life.The supervisors
from both domains also highlighted personal events occur-
ring in a doctoral student's life, such as the birth of a child,
relationship problems, and illnesses, as a hindrance to study
progress. These events were often described in conjunction
with the theme of motivation.
Children and study breaks during child care leave.Supervi-
sors generally understood that at the time of doctoral study,
the persons are often at an age of creating a family and that
raising children is an understandable part of everyday life.
They also expressed that absences during child care leave
can hinder the progress.
Mostly it was mentioned that when away from research
for a longer period, a student loses the habit of doing research
work, which is why several doctoral students had decided to
give up on their studies. There were supervisors who also
openly expressed their dissatisfaction with doctoral students
putting their families before their commitments to doctoral
research. The supervisors claimed that in cases where doc-
toral students return from academic leave, it is often difficult
for them to get adjusted to research and the work routine, as
highlighted by Kristjan (NA):
They start the doctoral studies, then find someone, and then
can't bear to wait; they have a baby, and then another one and
then several years pass . . . it is very hard to return because
they've lost the habit to work already--here you have to work
every single day! . . . and then they say that they can't do it
anymore and they'd rather discontinue their studies.
Other events in a personal life.The supervisors also
expressed their understanding toward the influence of other
personal events in a doctoral student's life, for example,
relationship difficulties with a partner and a doctoral stu-
dent's own or a parent's illness. If the student shares this
information with the supervisor, the supervisors say they
offer support and are generally understanding and patient
about any drop in the pace of research, as the following
example illustrates:
They are like your own child to you. . . . You also know how
their family matters are going, why they cannot do research, or
how things are with babysitting or some other things and then
you try to solve the problems as much as you can, so that they
can commit to their doctoral research. (Heldur; NA)
Material resources and the time available to spend on doctoral
research.Alongside a weak academic level, lack of motiva-
tion and diligence, and personal life events hindering a stu-
dent's studies, the interviewed supervisors from the
educational field also mentioned insufficient material
resources and thereby the need for doctoral students to work
elsewhere during their doctoral studies. We have previously
indicated that the NA apply for funding to employ doctoral
students into their research groups. Even in cases where stu-
dents need a higher income (for instance, the interviewees
named having children, taking up a mortgage), they never-
theless tried to avoid that a doctoral student would take up
employment outside the university. Additional work at the
university was offered to the doctoral student; for instance,
getting a doctoral student involved in supervising a master's
thesis.
In the educational sciences, however, it was mostly
already clear at the admission phase that a doctoral student
will be employed elsewhere during their doctoral studies,
and thus, their doctoral research was not going to be their
primary job. The interviewed ED saw working alongside
one's studies as a necessity, because neither the supervisor
nor the university has sufficient resources to provide the stu-
dent. Therefore, longer breaks in a student's studies caused
by other commitments were also considered natural, as Karla
(ED) pointed out during his interview:
Doctoral study is a pain. A pain in a sense that there's no money,
a person has to work at their main job and then do their doctoral
studies and so they have two primary loads, they have family,
children . . . cannot do research like this . . . in a good case a
doctoral student is paid the allowance. How much? 384 Euros.
Which is considerably lower than the average salary and now I
[as a supervisor] have to poke them and ask why are you not
doing your doctoral research?
Supervisor's Coping With the Process of a
Doctoral Student's Study Stall
When analyzing the text excerpts where the supervisors
described students' study stalls, then with only a few excep-
tions was a doctoral student's progress directly linked to their
supervisor's activity (i.e., problems were observed in the
actions of both parties), as Riina (ED) explains it,
To be honest I do think that it was a two-way process that they
didn't complete their studies. Maybe I didn't support them
enough, maybe they needed more help.
Several supervisors brought out how students' study stall
affected their motivation to supervise a doctoral student.
Lepp et al. 9
When the supervisor sensed it unlikely for a student to com-
plete their studies (i.e., according to the supervisor, the doc-
toral student is not capable, motivated, nor diligent enough;
has too much other work or family commitments), they also
cease to contribute to the supervision. It was found that a
one-sided effort (i.e., supervisor's) is not enough, as illus-
trated below by Anna (ED):
Now another year has passed. . . . Last time I bothered them was
a long time ago, and I don't know how can I make them to write
the dissertation? I can't make an adult person to write. . . . In the
end the supervisor also loses motivation.
How the supervisors get past difficult supervision situa-
tions was discussed in a few interviews. For example, it was
mentioned that they discuss problems with other supervisors
from the research group or with a co-supervisor. It was also
emphasized that colleagues' advice and suggestions had not
always solved the problems, and it was said that because the
problems mostly came from the PhD student, it is hard to
solve the situations. Several participating supervisors also
believed that supervisors need to manage everything by
themselves and there is no need to support the supervisor
specifically or to train them in management, as highlighted
by Uno (ED):
I think that supervisors are independent enough, and I guess it
has to be like that. Who else would know how to supervise a
supervisor?
Overall, supervisors use different strategies in cases of
study stall and are mostly understanding when the study time
stretches longer than the nominal period of study. However,
they also think that the responsibility for the studies lies with
the doctoral student, as was concluded by the words of Uku
(NA):
You can't make anyone become a researcher! You have to want
to do this, and if you do, then my job [as a supervisor] is to help
you. If a person doesn't wish to become a researcher, then they
can do something better then.
Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this study was to explore doctoral supervisors'
explanations for the stall of doctoral students' studies and to
describe the activities that they said they take on such occa-
sions. We discuss some of the main results and conclude with
recommendations for making changes in doctoral study
arrangements.
Overall, the results of this study align with results of other
studies (D'Andrea, 2002; Gardner, 2009; Hoskins &
Goldberg, 2005; Lovitts, 2001). These results demonstrate
the importance of getting the "right applicants" from a super-
visor's perspective. Therefore, one of the possible solutions
for preventing slowing of the study progress is to find the
right doctoral student, that is, someone whose abilities and
motivation are well suited.
The results of the current research showed that the inter-
viewed supervisors considered previous positive experiences
with the supervisee(s), as well as previous activity in the
same research field, as a significant and positive influence on
the cooperation process. However, such an approach consid-
erably narrows down the available selection of "able" doc-
toralstudents,especiallyinthecontextofinternationalization.
Therefore, it would be important to discuss the issue openly
with supervisors to find solutions on how to guarantee the
quality of doctoral students as well as the feeling of security
expected by supervisors while starting cooperation with an
unknown doctoral student.
In relation to this, what is novel about the results is that
only a few of the educational sciences supervisors claimed
to systematically and purposefully prepare potential doc-
toral students for doctoral study, while this was considered
to be a natural part of the process among the NA. Thus, both
supervisors from the educational and natural sciences
expected doctoral students to have a prior thorough prepara-
tion when entering doctoral study and the ability to be as
independent as possible during their studies. However, the
supervisors also did preliminary work to a different extent
so that the doctoral student could be successful in their stud-
ies. Knowing that the graduating efficiency is higher in the
natural sciences (see, for example, Gardner, 2009; Ots,
Leijen, & Pedaste, 2012), we suggest that this theme should
therefore be analyzed more when developing a doctoral
study program. In our opinion, the organization of doctoral
studies should move more toward the aim of a systematic,
purposeful, and substantive preparation of a doctoral stu-
dent, and the functional cooperation between a doctoral
applicant and a potential supervisor should already begin
during previous study levels or that previous cooperation
should be at least sufficiently long so that the supervisor and
supervisee have the opportunity to understand each other's
expectations and working style before the potential student
applies for a doctoral study. Closer communication with a
supervisor would also be necessary to enable a doctoral can-
didate to get an overview of the nature of doctoral studies,
including the knowledge and personality traits expected
from a doctoral student and the demands set by doctoral
studies to a doctoral student's daily life. This would prevent
and lessen situations where the cooperation falters due to a
lack of clarity regarding communication and competencies.
One practical recommendation for preparing suitable candi-
dates for doctoral study is the idea of a pre-PhD programs
offered by Sonneveld (2015), the aim of which is to test stu-
dent candidates' motivation (i.e., doctoral students' ambi-
tions), while also helping the students to develop their
research plan and allowing them to communicate and build
a relationship with their supervisor.
10 SAGE Open
Another interesting theme we discovered, which is also
linked to the previous sub-themes, is the dissatisfaction sev-
eral supervisors (from educational sciences) expressed with
the knowledge and skills of their doctoral students and the
strategies they claimed to use to develop these. If the knowl-
edge and skills of a doctoral student were considered insuf-
ficient for them to progress in their studies, then the ED
expressed that these doctoral students should attend relevant
courses to address these shortcomings. In the case of doc-
toral students' study stalls, Ahern and Manathunga (2004)
have also recommended that supervisors should first seek to
find out the origin of the block. If the cause of a block is in
the cognitive domain (e.g., a doctoral student has insufficient
academic writing skills), it will be efficient to advise the stu-
dent to attend suitable courses. In the present study, teaching
by supervisors (e.g., teaching academic writing) was only
mentioned in a few cases. However, previous studies (e.g.,
Manathunga, 2005) have demonstrated that a pedagogical
focus--direct teaching--is essential during doctoral study to
avoid study stall.
The results of this study demonstrated that doctoral stu-
dents in the natural sciences have daily contact with their
supervisors and often have an employer­employee relation-
ship. However, doctoral students from the educational sci-
ences mostly have day jobs unrelated to their doctoral
research. The investigated supervisors noted that work com-
mitments are often the reason for longer breaks in a doctoral
student's studies, and the supervisors often do not have an
overview of the doctoral student's progress and activities.
This formed the basis of the supervisors'strategy in the cases
of study stall. In situations where the supervisor had no
employment relationship with the supervisee, the supervi-
sors created a kind of "defense explanation" for themselves.
In other words, as they do not provide the doctoral student
with any funding, they also do not have the right to demand
faster progress with their studies. Therefore, specific dead-
lines for finishing different stages of doctoral research are
not set, and regular contact with the doctoral student is not
maintained. Previous studies (e.g., Brew & Peseta, 2004;
Lee, 2008) have, however, demonstrated that regular meet-
ings are crucial for the study to progress.
Following Manathunga's (2005) advice, contact between
a supervisor and a supervisee should be regular, as this allows
for systematic monitoring of the doctoral student's progress.
In addition, it also gives the supervisor the opportunity to
model the research process. This can also lead to situations
where independent work periods (especially after complet-
ing the mandatory classes) leave a doctoral student alone in
the process. Previous studies (e.g., Stubb, Pyhältö, & Lonka,
2011) have demonstrated that being left alone, as a doctoral
student, is a substantial factor behind study stall and discon-
tinuation. Interaction between doctoral students and their
research environments leads to a greater acquisition of
knowledge and student development, and is therefore central
for succeeding in one's studies (e.g., Lovitts, 2001; Pyhältö
et al., 2009). Ahern and Manathunga (2004) have also found
that the reasons for a doctoral student's slow progress and
study stall can be related to aspects of their social domain,
that is, a doctoral student's weak connection with the depart-
ment's research culture is often a factor that hinders the stu-
dent's study progress. Our suggestion for supervisors is,
therefore, to incorporate the student into the research com-
munity. Therefore, it is important to teach and train supervi-
sors institutionally, including aspects of how to support
different students.
Because the results demonstrate that the employee­
employer relationship gives the supervisor more opportunity
to support a doctoral student's progress, the universities
could also discuss to what extent working as a supervisor is
even justified in cases where there are no research projects
and hence, no financial support. In the case of working in a
research group, it is important to observe that a doctoral stu-
dent maintains the possibility to develop into an independent
researcher and to prevent a situation where the doctoral stu-
dent just remains the supervisor's underling. However, a par-
allel analysis is needed if solely large (financed) research
projects and research groups would also cover themes in
society that are related to developing smaller and narrower
research areas. In the context of a small country such as
Estonia, it is especially important as big research groups
have high research capability (and thus, the possibility to
obtain financial support for their research projects), but there
is a danger of developing a limited number of research top-
ics, and many important practical problems may not reach
high-quality studies.
We also consider relevant the result where the participat-
ing supervisors considered completing a doctoral study
within the nominal 4 years not that important for them, as a
longer study period enables the doctoral student to spend
more time in the research environment and facilitate more
comprehensive learning. Thus, it is possible that several
supervisors also select a supervising strategy which, provok-
ingly, can be named as a "patiently waiting" or "wait-and-
see" attitude. However, this view can also be a "defense
explanation," that is, since the supervisor has not been able
to help their supervisee to reach the dissertation defense
within the nominal period, the supervisor justifies this as a
non-priority goal. Therefore, we think that a debate in the
education field is needed to discuss the shared understanding
of the nominal period for a doctorial study and the necessity
to graduate within the nominal period of study, and whether
and to what extent it is even necessary that the doctorial
study period is so rigidly laid out in the first place. It is pos-
sible that if a supervisor does not put value to a student com-
pleting their studies within the nominal study, values lifelong
learning and personal development, and prefers a longer
study period to a fast completion, and hence, a longer period
of staying in the research world, then it is hard to make the
supervisory cooperation more efficient. Hence, we suggest
that it is first necessary to ascertain supervisors', doctoral
Lepp et al. 11
students', and institutions' expectations about doctoral study
and accordingly design strategies.
The last sub-theme in the results that particularly attracted
our attention was how the supervisors described their activi-
ties in cases where a doctoral student stalls or wishes to dis-
continue their studies. With only a few exceptions, the
reasons were described as also supervisor related. It is well
known that the supervisor is one of the central success fac-
tors in the doctoral study process (see, for example, Golde,
2005; Lee, 2008), and therefore, it was surprising that the
participating supervisors emphasized their role to such a
small extent. A discussion is also needed about the role of a
supervisor and their tasks during the study process of a doc-
toral student and whether supervisors should be offered
opportunities for self-analysis and reflection.
Although this article reports on a small-scale study in
which the narrow focus poses certain limitations, we find
that the above-described implications could benefit doctoral
programs in Estonia and other countries facing similar chal-
lenges. It is important that supervisors are aware of the pos-
sible hindrances students can experience during their doctoral
study, can notice them, and know efficient and useful support
strategies. Debates to ascertain the different parties' expecta-
tions are also important. Further research could, in our opin-
ion, concentrate on doctoral students' views on their
supervisors' activity or the lack of in cases of study stall.
Additional value to increase the credibility of the findings of
this study could be brought about by researching supervisors'
actual activities and practices.
