Learning encompasses a multitude of competencies, from

sometimes proceeds with relative ease. These are a few of the
things we know about learning. But learning is a complex affair.
The results of learning are often observable in human

Introduction
As a practical theologian, specializing in the field of religious
education and religious pedagogy, I, and my international col-
leagues, deal with the concept of learning. Our research on
learning is carried out in practical theological studies on the
practices of religious education, whether in church communi-
ties or in schools or wherever these practices are located.
Increasingly, the primary focus is shifting from religious
education toward studying young people in certain faith
practices, which emphasize the concept of learning in aca-
demic studies (see, for example, Sonnenberg & Barnard,
2012). Although learning is becoming a common feature in
many practical theological studies on young people in faith
practices, the way learning is conceptualized varies. This is
my observation in various research projects conducted by
our Research Centre for Youth, Church & Culture (OJKC)1
and has been my observation in the international field of aca-
demic studies on youth ministry and religious education.
Because learning is an important factor in the reflection
on young people in faith practices, I will argue in this article
that practical theological studies could profit from a clarifi-
cation of the concept, including an explanation of different
angles of use involved in current research and publications.
Learning in general, for example, is often conceived of as a
persisting change in performance or performance potential
(Driscoll, 2000). Faith learning in particular, then, can be
conceived as a particular change in how one performs in the
religious domain. However, sometimes we see faith learning
explained as a form of meaning-making process, whereas

What About Learning in Practical
Theological Studies? Toward More
Conceptual Clarity
A. (Jos) de Kock1
Abstract
Because learning is an important concept in the reflection on young people in faith practices, practical theological studies
on the theme of learning profit from a clarification of the concept of learning. Therefore, current (empirical) research
projects conducted by the Dutch Research Centre for Youth, Church, and Culture and educational and religious education
literature on learning have been analyzed. The results provide an overview of utilized descriptions of learning, (theological)
interpretations of learning, normative positions regarding learning, and strategic considerations toward (the promotion of)
learning. Implications for future practical theological research into (faith) learning in the context of faith practices of young
people are discussed.

other authors approach the concept of learning as part of
socialization processes, which is another angle of use.
By way of illustration of different angles of use of the con-
cept, the article briefly describes current research projects car-
ried out at our OJKC (section "Illustration: Current Research
in the Dutch OJKC"). This illustration, at the same time,
applies preliminary perspectives on how the concept of learn-
ing might be clarified. Next, the article provides a clarification
of the concept learning regarding practical theological studies
on young people in faith practices. This clarification, as will be
concluded, is helped by distinguishing among descriptions of
learning, interpretations of learning, normative positions
regarding learning, and strategic considerations toward (the
promotion of) learning. This argument is established based on
a discussion of educational literature on learning, including
Religious Education literature on learning.
The context of learning studied in the current article is
faith practices. Practical theologians seek to understand reli-
gion and faith as they are involved in church life and every-
day life; we could say it is about the hermeneutics of lived
religion (Ganzevoort, 2009). Learning as part of the lived
religion of people is rightfully an object of practical theologi-
cal studies. Because of the importance, we need clarity in our
focus on how learning is defined in child and youth studies.
Recently, Schweitzer (2014), in his article "Religion in
Childhood and Adolescence: How Should It Be Studied? A
Critical Review of Problems and Challenges in Methodology
and Research," proposed criteria for empirical studies in reli-
gion among children and adolescents. These criteria empha-
sizetheimportanceofclarityabouttheuseofinterdisciplinary
frameworks and religious and nonreligious interpretive per-
spectives in these studies. This article aims at gaining such
clarity, in particular on learning in practical theological
reflections on youth and religion.
Different aspects of learning are stressed in empirical
studies on learning (processes) regarding faith and/or reli-
gion conducted during the past 10 years by Le Cornu (2005);
Burton, Paroschi, Habenicht, and Hollingsead (2006); and
Niemelä (2006). Le Cornu (2005) presents a typology of four
ways of believing and learning based on an interview study
among 21 students, of whom the youngest was 21 years and
the oldest 88 years, against the background of their theologi-
cal educational contexts ranging from first-year theological
studies to postdoctoral studies. The typology is grounded in
a distinction between Christian faith content and day-to-day
experiences. This results in four types of learner-believers.
The first type is the discrete learners group, who largely hold
their faith and their experience as two separate dimensions of
their lives. The second type is the related learners group,
who integrate faith and experience. The third type is the
assimilative learners group, who assimilate their faith in
their experience. The fourth type is the interpretive learners
group, who tend to interpret experience according to faith
principles premises.
Burton et al. (2006) report on a study of videotaped inter-
views with 12 five- to six-year-old children who attended
two different Sabbath school classes at a U.S. Midwestern
Seventh-Day Adventist church. The study concerned the
impact of the curriculum design (a traditional vs. a revised
curriculum) on children's learning. Learning was measured
in terms of factual biblical learning and the ability to express
messages from Bible stories.
Niemelä (2006) reports on a questionnaire study among
more than 1,000 young people before and after they partici-
pated in confirmation classes in Finland. The main question
posed is about the quality and effectiveness of the classes and
the outcome measures for meeting social expectations (such
as attractive leisure time activities), meeting religious expec-
tations (such as strengthening faith), meeting expectations
regarding growing up (such as becoming independent), atti-
tude toward Christianity, and belief in God.
Each study stresses different aspects of learning: the rela-
tionship between learning, faith, and experience (Le Cornu,
2005); the outcomes of learning--among which are factual
biblical knowledge and the expression of biblical messages
(Burton et al., 2006); and the relationship between or distinc-
tion between "general development," religious development,
and the social domain (Niemelä, 2006).
This comparison shows different aspects or angles of use
of learning. This raises the question if these aspects and
angles of use of learning, in the context of the religious
domain, can be summarized or classified. This article strives,
in the words of Driscoll (2000), as quoted at the very begin-
ning of this article, for an overview of various theories, per-
spectives, assumptions, and beliefs about learning. This
overview can advance the practical theological reflections
and empirical research on youth and religion in which learn-
ing processes are debated.
I first briefly describe current research projects carried out
at the OJKC (section "Illustration: Current Research in the
Dutch OJKC"). Next, the way in which the concept of learn-
ing functions in projects such as those conducted by our
research center is explained further focusing on definition
and interpretation of learning, and on normative and strategic
perspectives (section "Analysis: Definition, Interpretation,
and Normative and Strategic Perspectives on Learning").2
This discussion is broadened by drawing into the debate
additional educational literature on learning, including
Religious Education literature on learning. The article ends
with a conclusion and a discussion of the results (section
"Conclusion and Discussion").

To illustrate various angles of the use of learning, I now
briefly describe current research projects carried out at the
OJKC. This illustration is based on published articles as well
as unpublished manuscripts produced by eight senior and
junior researchers at the OJKC. This description aims at pro-
viding preliminary perspectives on how learning might be
clarified.3

Definitions and Interpretations of Learning
When it comes to the concept of learning in the OJKC proj-
ects, faith learning in particular is often at stake. Only two
times in the publications and manuscripts of the OJKC stud-
ies, however, is a definition of faith learning presented. An
OJKC researcher, Meerveld (forthcoming), empirically stud-
ies how learning is strived for and the actual learning results
of youth catechesis within different types of catechetical
practices. In his study, he uses a broad definition of faith
learning. Meerveld defines faith learning as a form of learn-
ing in which what is strived for or in which the result of the
learning process is in the field of faith content, behavior
(praxis), attitudes, experiences, or perceptions. Sonnenberg
and Barnard (2012) present a definition of faith learning:
They see, following Roebben (2007), the learning of faith as
a "discovery of meaning." Next, we observe several interpre-
tative frameworks with which (faith) learning can be under-
stood: learning as a socialization process, as an
identity-development process, as a physical process, and as a
quality of youth worship.
De Kock, Roeland, and Vos (2011) position learning prac-
tices in the framework of religious socialization and distin-
guish three types of religious socialization. First, the theory
of traditional socialization conceptualizes religious social-
ization as the transition of religious beliefs and values: pass-
ing on of the Christian faith to the next generation. Second,
according to the theory of modern socialization, adults raise
children by supporting the youths'personal identity develop-
ment. In this socialization approach, learning practices are all
about coaching. The third theory of socialization, called
tribal socialization, points to the experiential practice of
faith, which is felt and sensed rather than understood intel-
lectually. In this approach, learning practices are directed
toward participation: learning by doing and experiencing.
OJKC researcher Van Wijnen (Van Wijnen, forthcoming &
Van Wijnen, submitted) empirically investigated small
groups of adolescents in youth ministry and based on that
study states that faith needs tribalization, as a process beyond
individualization: "There is a strong cohesion between the
(communal) content of faith and the way faith tribes do expe-
rience faith" (Van Wijnen, submitted). Van Wijnen and
Barnard (2014) conclude that faith happens, is practiced, and
is lived out in the midst of the lives of the adolescents stud-
ied. The authors plead for a turning away from faith social-
ization based on an isolated cognitive basis and a faith
language as a logical framework to a more narrative approach
in which adolescents' life stories are connected to narratives
of the shared faith tradition of the local congregation.
Learning can also be interpreted as an identity-development
process. Following De Kock (2014b), one of the goal catego-
ries for religious learning processes is goals in terms of iden-
tity development. In our research project on the religious
identity development of highly religious Christian and
Muslim adolescents, we carried out an in-depth interview
study among 10 young Christian adults and 10 young Muslim
adults. The framework for the project was reported in
Religious Education by Visser-Vogel, Westerink, De Kock,
Barnard, and Bakker (2012). The research contributes to the
development theories formulated by Erikson (1968), Marcia
(1966, 1980), McAdams (2005, 2008), and Schachter and
Ventura (2008). Identity in general, and religious identity in
particular, is a process in which individuals explore and com-
mit to a set of religious beliefs and practices that are con-
structed in relation to the context (including the societal
context), situation, and reaction of others (Visser-Vogel, De
Kock, Barnard, & Bakker, submitted-a, submitted-b). Van
Wijnen and Barnard (submitted) in a study of small groups of
adolescents stress the importance of the social context and
the collective identity of different relationships for identity
development. Themes such as relationships, sexuality, going
out, and dress codes function as identity markers for ortho-
dox Christian youngsters. For Muslim orthopraxy young-
sters, acquiring knowledge (general knowledge, knowledge
about Islam, and knowledge about underlying values), obey-
ing Allah, and participating in and being involved with their
community appear to be important themes in their religious
identity construction (Visser-Vogel et al., submitted-b).
Visser-Vogel, De Kock, Barnard, and Bakker (submitted-c;
2015) discuss the complexity and multifaceted character of
the exploration processes of Muslim youngsters and discuss
various sources for the religious identity development of
orthoprax Muslim adolescents.
De Kock and Sonnenberg (2012) reflect on learning in
terms of a physical process when they address the question
of how embodiment can conceptually be related to religious
learning processes in youth ministry. The background for
this question is the observation that youth worship events can
erase religious learning (as suggested by, among others,
Astley, 1984), resulting in the increasing attention paid to a
bodily and physical approach in youth ministry.
"Religious knowledge is embodied knowledge because it is
constructed by personal and social acts, experiences,
performances and gatherings in the religious community. At the
very heart of religious learning is learning by doing and social
interaction, observing and experiencing the religious life of
others and of oneself. This is in congruence with growing
attention in religious pedagogy to learning goals in terms of
emotions and experiences in addition to merely cognitive goals.
(De Kock & Sonnenberg, 2012, p. 15)"
As an implication, religious education should not only
focus on mediation of the Word through speaking and read-
ing but also through doing, feeling, and partaking of the
sacraments.
One other interpretive framework for learning observed in
the OJKC projects is learning as a quality of faith practices,
4 SAGE Open
particularly in worship practices. Barnard and Wepener
(2012) see worship as a spiritual implicit learning environ-
ment in which "more explicit cognitive knowledge" can be
communicated. "Worship has a formative power in shaping
believers, more specifically Christian believers, because it
evokes and expresses basic attitudes that enable faith.
Worship is the learning environment in which we become
Christians through the power of ritual" (Barnard & Wepener,
2012, p. 7). These insights are further elaborated in OJKC
researcher Ronelle Sonnenberg's PhD project on the partici-
pation of adolescents in local youth worship services and
national youth worship events in Protestant contexts
(Sonnenberg, 2015). A key finding was that "learning faith"
is one of the qualities of adolescents' participation in youth
worship. Based on empirical findings (collected by participa-
tive observation and interviews), Sonnenberg and Barnard
(2012) distinguish learning impulses from learning products.
Important impulses in youth worship events are discussions,
sermons, speeches, and song texts. Learning products
appeared to be information and support, knowledge about
and insight into God, religious and social-ethical applica-
tions, relevance of tradition, and rules and freedom.
Furthermore, the educational function of worship appeared
to be apparent through its dialogical dimensions: One voice
is not authoritative; the dialogue between voices matters.
Normative Considerations in Relationship to
Learning
The OJKC research projects show various normative consid-
erations regarding learning, all of which have implications for
improving learning processes in faith practices. Starting from
the vision of the church as a learning community, De Kock,
Elhorst, and Barnard (2015) point at four characteristics of
faith learning in the church as a learning community, which
are mainly derived from Schippers (1977), Saris (1982),
Nipkow (1982), and Osmer (2005): (a) faith learning as inter-
generational learning, (b) faith learning as learning in relation
(religious experience is there in encounters with Jesus Christ
and with each other in His spirit), (c) faith learning as learning
in (everyday) life, and (d) faith learning as emancipatory
learning (learning is directed toward durable change).
In another article, De Kock (2015) raises the question how
religious learning processes found in the missionary context
of youth work and the guidance of these learning processes
can be understood religiously pedagogically. To find answers
to this question, the article presents the results of fieldwork
into a case of Christian youth work outside the church and the
religious pedagogical reflection in this fieldwork. In field-
work, De Kock (2015) has detected five main themes regard-
ing religious learning at the street level: (a) vision of God,
man, and the street; (b) the message; (c) the means; (d) the
didactical model; and (e) the relationship with the church.
The main conclusion of this particular study is that religious
learning processes are situated in the encounter. This can be
understood in various ways: as an encounter between young-
ster and youth worker, as an encounter by living and acting
together, and as an encounter involved in discussing and
thinking together about personal, societal, and religious
questions. The concept of encounter or meeting is inspired
by the concept of narthical religious learning introduced by
Roebben (2007, 2009). The study also points out that due to
various tendencies, the function of church communities serv-
ing as places for learning increasingly is displaced by con-
texts outside the physical boundaries of the church and even
existing outside the institutional boundaries of the church,
that is, at the "street level."
Setting goals for learning practices is another normative
consideration observed in OJKC research. De Kock (2014b)
delineates (a) learning goals in terms of cognition and affec-
tion, (b) learning goals in terms of emotions and experiences,
(c) learning goals in terms of the formation of one's own
opinion and social interaction, and (d) learning goals in terms
of identity development. An interview study by De Kock
(2014a), however, reveals that many formulations of goals
that catechists devise for themselves do not fit in these prede-
signed theoretical categories: for example, "`learning to
know Jesus,' `to talk about something,' `to find truth' and
`being served pastorally'" (p. 66). The author discusses the
theological and biblical normativity in a reflection on reli-
gious learning. Differing orientations toward faith learning
goals hark back to differences in the personal theologies held
by catechists. "What specific biblical-theological concepts
can probably be considered foundational to a catechist's
arrangement of catechetical learning environments?" (De
Kock, 2014a, p. 68). This brings us to the final point of
reflection observed in the OJKC material: the implications of
how learning is conceptualized for improving learning pro-
cesses in faith practices.
In De Kock's (2012) work, three models of religious or
catechetical education are elaborated: a behavioral model, a
developmental model, and an apprenticeship model. De
Kock and Sonnenberg (2012) indicate that within the last
few decades, a change can be observed--from using behav-
ioral models of religious education to adopting developmen-
tal and apprenticeship models. De Kock (2012) elaborates
that in religious learning environments set up according to a
behavioral model, the teacher directs the content of the les-
sons. This requires the learners to acquire the content and the
teachers to conduct assignments and to check whether the
content is mastered. Whereas, in religious learning environ-
ments that follow a developmental model, learners learn
from observing the teacher's performance: He or she ques-
tions, contradicts, and challenges the learners'personal theo-
ries. The content of what should be learned depends on what
the learners want to learn and the ideal of independent criti-
cal thinking. In religious learning environments set up
according to an apprenticeship model, the person of the
teacher--who he or she is and does--directs the learning
process. Religious content and the learners' specific interests
de Kock 5
are embedded in the personal relationship between teacher
and learner and embedded in the tradition of a particular reli-
gious practice.
In "a typology of catechetical learning environments," De
Kock (2014b) elaborates further on the three models of reli-
gious learning environments. Based on a literature review of
studies about catechetical learning environments and learn-
ing processes, De Kock develops a typology of catechetical
learning environments in which the author distinguishes
between the roles of catechist and catechumens and high-
lights the learning goals of religious learning processes. The
role division follows the distinction among behavioral,
developmental, and apprenticeship models of learning envi-
ronments presented earlier by De Kock (2012): In a behav-
ioral model, the role of the catechist is instructing the
catechumen; in a developmental model, the role of the cate-
chist is questioning, contradicting, and challenging the cate-
chumen's personal theories; and in an apprenticeship model,
the catechist and the catechumen participate in a shared
world, the faith community.
Analysis: Definition, Interpretation, and
Normative and Strategic Perspectives
on Learning
The different ways in which the concept of learning appears
to be discussed, as shown in the previous illustration of the
OJKC research projects, is now elaborated on in terms of
definitions, interpretations, and normative and strategic per-
spectives. This discussion is broadened by including addi-
tional educational literature on learning and Religious
Education literature on learning.
Definitions of Learning and Descriptions of
Learning
The illustration of the OJKC research reveals a few straight-
forward definitions of learning in general, of faith learning in
particular, and of religious learning. Meerveld (forthcoming)
defines faith learning as a form of learning that leads in the
field of faith content to results in terms of behavior (praxis),
attitudes, experiences, and perceptions. Sonnenberg and
Barnard (2012) compress the field of faith learning into a
discovery of meaning.
"Learning is discovering meanings that are presented in liturgy,
the Bible, tradition, culture and by peers and adults and so we
name this process of acquiring theological knowledge a
"discovery of meaning" in its own right . . . we do not consider
the discovery of meaning as the final learning product, for the
final discovery is the existential relationship between God and
the individual . . . This meaning can be considered as theological
knowledge because it can be located in the relation between God
and the worshipper." (Sonnenberg & Barnard, 2012, p. 3)
These two definitions of faith learning treat it as a general
process of learning in a particular domain, namely, the
domain of religion or faith. In this respect, the definitions
lean on a general definition of learning, as for instance pro-
vided by Driscoll (2000): "Learning is a persisting change in
performance or performance potential that results from expe-
rience and interaction with the world" (p. 3). Or in the words
of Boekaerts and Simons (1995),
"We claim that someone learns or has learned something when
we detect a relatively subtle change in his or her behaviour or
can determine changes in behavioural dispositions when these
are results of learning activities and have a certain degree of
agility . . .. Learning as such we generally cannot observe. We
conclude on the basis of changes in behaviour that people have
learned or we hear from people that they regard themselves as
having learned" [translated from Dutch]. (p. 3)
And again, in the words of Van der Veen and Van der Wal
(2012),
"Learning is realizing mental processes by way of selecting,
absorbing, processing, integrating, establishing, utilizing of and
attributingmeaningtovariousformsofinformation(experiences,
happenings and phenomenon in reality), which lead to
sustainable changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, motives and/
or the ability to learn" [translated from Dutch]. (p. 30)
Boekaerts and Simons do not regard learning itself as
observable because we can speak of realized learning based
only on its observed outcomes. This contrasts with consider-
able reflections in the literature that try to grasp the essence
of what transpires in learning. This also holds for the OJKC
research projects. If, for example, one considers learning
synonymous with identity development, then what transpires
as religious learning might be observable as a process of reli-
gious exploration and making commitments to a set of reli-
gious beliefs and practices (see Visser-Vogel et al.,
submitted-a, submitted-b). It raises the question whether
concepts can be used to depict what transpires during learn-
ing itself, in particular in the realm of faith learning. At least
four types of descriptions of learning can be distinguished,
regarding the essence of learning, termed approaches to
learning.
The first type of learning description concentrates on the
relational basis: (Faith) learning is a relational process
because the religious experience is derived from the encoun-
ter with God or Jesus Christ and from an encounter with
other people (in His spirit), both inter- and intragenerational.
The second type concentrates on the process of acquiring
principles of faith and mainly cognitive religious/faith con-
tent (as supplied by leaders or the tradition). The third type
concentrates on the process of the individual believer
engaged in subjectively constructing the (religious) self and
doing this based on independent critical thinking. The fourth
6 SAGE Open
type concentrates on the process of faith in action: doing and
experiencing social interaction in faith practices (whether
formal practices or practices in everyday life).
These four approaches complement the three approaches
to (faith) learning distinguished by Alii (2009):
- Learning by doing, based on the principle of trial-and-error
- Learning with and by heart, a form of cognitive learning
-
Learning as an intersubjective activity: reflecting together on
experiences regarding faith. (pp. 196-203)
Regarding the first approach to faith learning, this corre-
sponds with what Nipkow (1982) claims in his "Grundfragen
der Religionspädagogik" where he points at the intergenera-
tional heart of the process of learning: In his view, Christian
formation means "living together and faith learning in
between the generations [translated from the original German
text]" (Nipkow, 1982, p. 33). Regarding the second aspect of
faith learning (acquiring principles and content), we refer-
ence the work of Sfard (1998), who identifies two metaphors
for learning: the acquisition metaphor and the participation
metaphor. I will explain in terms of OJKC research how the
second type of learning description (acquiring principles and
content) fits the acquisition metaphor and the fourth (faith in
action) fits the participation metaphor.
The acquisition metaphor characterizes learning as
"acquisition of something" directed toward the goal of indi-
vidual enrichment. In this metaphor, the "student" is a recipi-
ent and (re-)constructer, while the "teacher" is a provider,
facilitator, or mediator. Knowing in the acquisition metaphor
is conceptualized as "having" or "possessing," and thus,
knowledge is an individual or public property, as a posses-
sion or commodity.
When it comes to the participation metaphor for learning,
Sfard demarcates learning as "becoming a participant" and
directed toward the goal of community building. The "stu-
dent" is an apprentice or peripheral participant, while the
"teacher" preserves practice and discourse or acts as an
expert participant. Knowing in the participation metaphor is
conceptualized as "belonging," "participating," or "commu-
nicating," and thus, knowledge is an aspect of practice, a dis-
course, or activity.
Adding to the model of acquisition and the participation
metaphors, Paavola and Hakkarainen (2005) advance a third
metaphor for learning: the knowledge-creation metaphor,
which they present as an emergent epistemological approach to
learning. Important background for introducing a knowledge-
creation metaphor is the current rise of knowledge societies.
The authors hark back to, among others, Sfard (1998), when
they characterize the acquisition metaphor as "monological"
within the mind approach to learning and the participation met-
aphor as a "dialogical" interaction approach (Paavola &
Hakkarainen, 2005, p. 539). According to the authors, neither
metaphor "appears to be sufficient when addressing pro-
cesses of deliberately creating and advancing knowledge"
(p. 538). The knowledge-creation metaphor covers a "tria-
logical" approach: "developing collaborative shared objects
and artefacts" (Paavola & Hakkarainen, 2005, p. 539).
The first type of learning description (with a focus on the
relational basis of learning) and the third type (with a focus
on the individual construction basis of learning) conceptu-
ally combine into what is suggested by the knowledge-cre-
ation metaphor of learning. The knowledge-creation
metaphor sees learning as individuals and groups creating
social structures and collaborative processes that support the
growth of knowledge and innovation, generating new ideas,
conceptual knowledge, new practices, and new social struc-
tures. In the religious domain, this trialogical learning
approach results in the creation of new faith practices, in
terms of structures and theologies. Thus, we see the four
types of descriptions cover the various concentrations in
existing metaphors for learning.
Interpretation of the Process of Learning
This discussion tells us that learning has multiple aspects and
is embedded in practices. The OJKC research shows various
attempts to interpret what happens when faith learning pro-
cesses occur. First, we acknowledge four general interpreta-
tions of learning, which are not strictly theological, derived
from various disciplines such as Sociology (of religion),
Psychology (of learning), Developmental Psychology,
Anthropology, and Educational Sciences. After discussing
these nontheological interpretations, I will consider theologi-
cal interpretations in particular.
We can distinguish four general interpretations of the
learning process. First, learning is understood as a cognitive
process of exploring ideas, convictions, and beliefs and mak-
ing commitments to one or the other. Second, learning is
understood as a process of action where practices, behavior,
and actions are explored and commitments to one or the
other are made. The latter interpretation of learning is also
related to the interpretation of learning rooted in flesh and
blood bodies in which not only the cognitive aspect but also
the physical aspect of learning processes is addressed. Third,
learning is understood as a social process: Learning is rela-
tional and intergenerational, and thus, it is a product of (a
fluid combination of) socialization strategies and individual
choices. Fourth, learning is understood as a communal qual-
ity: Learning is embedded in the daily life contexts of com-
munities, and thus, it is not an individual but a collective
process.
These four broad interpretations partly mirror the attempts
made in the educational literature to interpret what happens
when learning processes occur. In the educational sciences,
these interpretation attempts are classified in six families of
educational theories (based on the elaborations by
Verschaffel, 1995, and Driscoll, 2000, as utilized by De Kock
de Kock 7
& Sonnenberg, 2012): (a) behaviorist theories, (b) cognitiv-
ist theories, (c) developmental theories, (d) motivational
theories, (e) constructivist theories, and (f) biological theo-
ries. It is partly mirrored because our four broad interpreta-
tions of learning form another kind of categorization
framework compared with the summary of the six families of
educational theories.
Thus, what theological interpretations can be observed in
particular? First, as illustrated, for example, by the OJKC
research, several learning impulses, elements that evoke
learning, are put forward. These impulses are the external
checking of acquired faith content, attention to learners' per-
sonal interests, learner participation in religious practices
(e.g., worship), and the encounter between (personal) long-
ings and (representatives of) religious perspectives, discus-
sions, sermons, speeches, and song texts.
Second, it can be determined that various elements are
advanced, which are expected to have impact on and steer
(faith) learning processes. A type of element concerns setting
particular goals: for example, cognitive goals; affective
goals, goals such as learning to know Jesus or finding truth,
realizing durable change, or being initiated into a faith com-
munity, having an existential relationship with God, and so
forth. Another type of element is that religious authority can
be found (regarding what should be learned and how and
what is true and worthwhile), leading to a question such as,
"Is the authority located externally in the tradition, or in the
religious leader, or in the learner himself or herself, or is it
embedded in the debate within the religious community?"
An additional element concerns how learning processes can
be understood as a result of theological and denominational
positions, including beliefs about the role and function of the
Bible, the church itself (and in relationship to society), the
tradition, and the actuality.
Normativity Regarding Learning
Let us now turn to normative considerations regarding learn-
ing. What (theological) normativity can be observed in the
description of the OJKC projects? First, learning (and teach-
ing) is presented as following one of the basic functions of
the church or congregational life. The vision of the church
should be one in which it sees itself as a learning community.
Thus, learning in itself is a core quality of the Christian
(faith) community. Second, light is shed on biblical-theolog-
ical concepts that might be foundational to (faith) learning
and the guidance of (faith) learning. Discipleship is an exam-
ple. Another example is the encounter of a Christian with
Jesus Christ as foundational for learning. This points toward
the phenomenon of relational learning, understood as learn-
ing situated in the encounter with God and each other.
Furthermore, different concentrations can be laid on learn-
ing, which should result from mediation of the Word by
speaking and reading or result from the sacraments by doing
and feeling.
Normative orientations, such as the encounter with Christ
and following Christ as disciples, are often observed in the
practical theological literature on learning. For example,
Dingemans (1991) stresses the centrality of the person of
Christ: Faith learning is not about a set of dogmas but about
a Person. Theologically, Dingemans translates faith learning
into "following Christ": "Our choice for the term `following'
is because it represents all elements of the cognitive, affec-
tive and attitudinal learning [translated from Dutch]"
(Dingemans, 1991, p. 138). Where Dingemans applies the
holistic approach of learning (cognitive, affective, and attitu-
dinal) to the theological concept of "following Christ," De
Kock and Verboom (2011) legitimate a similar holistic
approach by referring to the biblical vision of humankind in
which the heart (Hebrew: leb) is central when it comes to
learning: "(A) notion of learning from the heart (Hebrew:
leb) forming the core of our humanity moves towards head,
affection and the attitudinal [translated from Dutch]" (De
Kock & Verboom, 2011, p. 22).
De Kock and Sonnenberg (2012) argue that the six fami-
lies of educational learning theories (see "Interpretation of
the Process of Learning" above) function as not only inter-
pretation frameworks but also normative frameworks: Each
family of theories mirrors certain ideals when it comes to
learning processes, including faith practices:
"It should be emphasized that distinguishing one family of
educational learning theories does not in all aspects exclude
other families of theories. Although often in practice one or two
families are prominent, we note that characteristics from
different families can be simultaneously observed. However, the
distinction between the six families can help us to analyse what
kind of ideals are at stake in different religious pedagogical
approaches and in different religious learning practices." (De
Kock & Sonnenberg, 2012, p. 13)
Ideals are not necessarily fixed. Sfard (1998), for example,
presents a "patchwork" regarding education and learning in
general. She concludes that one should not have too great a
devotion to one particular metaphor for learning. Instead,
"It seems that the sooner we accept the thought that our work is
bound to produce a patchwork of metaphors rather than a
unified, homogeneous theory of learning, the better for us and
for those whose lives are likely to be affected by our work."
(Sfard, 1998, p. 12)
Normative positions have consequences for strategic con-
siderations followed in practices of (faith) learning. The next
section will discuss some of these strategic issues. One
should, however, keep in mind that often normative positions
and strategic choices (in terms of developing learning envi-
ronments for [faith] learning) cannot be clearly separated
from each other. This can be observed, for example, in the
work of Osmer (2005), who elaborates on the formation and
education task of congregations by describing three core
8 SAGE Open
tasks in Paul's teaching ministry as he observes in his
letters:
"(1) catechesis: i.e. handing over Israel's Scripture and early
Christian tradition; (2) exhortation: i.e. moral formation and
education; and (3) discernment: i.e. teaching congregations how
to understand the circumstances of their everyday life and world
in terms of God's promised future for creation." (pp. 26-27)
These three core tasks can be read as normative positions
taken from Paul, but at the same time, they can be read as
strategic landmarks. Faith communities should develop
learning environments in which Scripture and tradition are
handed over, in which moral formation and education take
place, and in which current life is interpreted in terms of
God's promises.
Another example of the interconnectedness of normative
positions and strategic considerations is in the work of White
(1988), who stresses the intergenerational character of reli-
gious learning processes. White explains that education has
to do with Learning/Growing/Living:
"Each word needs the other because "learning" alone too often
suggests strictly the cognitive acquisition of information . . .
"Growing" conveys a fuller development of persons, especially
in terms of one's inner or subjective side, having to do with the
affections but also to do with the psycho-motor or physical
aspects of the self. Together "learning" and "growing" have to
do with life "living" which . . . relates to faith lifestyle
development." (p. 26)
Intergenerational religious education thus contains cogni-
tive, affective, and lifestyle developments that according to
White (1988) are supported by four "patterns of relationship:
(1) In-Common-Experiences, (2) Parallel-Learning, (3)
Contributive-Occasions, and (4) Interactive-Sharing"
(pp. 26-29).
Strategic Considerations Regarding Learning
In the OJKC research described in the section "Illustration:
Current Research in the Dutch OJKC," various strategic con-
siderations regarding (the promotion of) faith learning can be
observed. Educational or didactical models for stimulating
learning processes are presented, involving a focus on trans-
mission, clarification, or communication. Narrative, sacra-
mental, and proclamation approaches are examined. The
most pronounced strategic contribution is the recently pre-
sented typology of 12 catechetical learning environments
(De Kock, 2014b). This typology combines strategic choices
regarding four types of learning goals to be strived for and
three models of religious or catechetical education (De Kock,
2012): a behavioral model, a developmental model, and an
apprenticeship model. The latter distinction harks back to
following particular instructional paradigms. We can distin-
guish between three instructional paradigms (based on a
classification scheme of Farnham-Diggory, 1994), further
expanded by De Kock, Sleegers, and Voeten (2004) and De
Kock (2005):
"(a) a behavioural paradigm reflecting a social system in which
the expert has a high status and the novice has a low status but is
expected to acquire more of the expert's expertise; (b) a
developmental paradigm reflecting a social system in which the
novice learns by developing his or her own personal theories
with the support of the expert, who may question, contradict,
and challenge those theories; and (c) an apprenticeship paradigm
reflecting a social system in which the learner must clearly
participate in the expert's world to learn (through acculturation)."
(De Kock, 2012, pp. 184-185)
These instructional paradigms shed light on an important
strategic consideration: What role does the teacher (whether
a pastor, a youth worker, a parent, or a peer) have in the
learning process? Is he or she directing the content of lessons
and checking acquisitions? Is he or she questioning and chal-
lenging learners' personal theories? Or is he or she modeling
a Christian life?
Conclusion and Discussion
This article aimed at gaining clarity regarding the concept of
learning in practical theological reflections on youth and reli-
gion. How might the variety of aspects and angles of use of
learning, in the context of the religious domain, be summa-
rized or classified? The conclusion might follow the quote by
Schweitzer (2006): "What exactly is a `religious learning pro-
cess'. . . is, conversely, not easy to define [translated from the
original German text]" (p. 115). Although it is not easy, the
descriptions and reflections in this article provide clarifica-
tions, which are helpful for future practical theological stud-
ies on learning in faith practices. To clarify, it appears helpful
to distinguish between descriptions of learning, interpreta-
tions of learning, normative positions regarding learning, and
strategic considerations toward (the promotion of) learning.
This brings us to the first conclusion: The concept of
learning as present in practical theological reflections on
youth and religion cannot be clarified by giving a univocal,
universal or undivided, sharp definition. The analysis in the
current article shows the many ways in which the concept of
learning might function in practical theological accounts. In
the first place, the concept functions on different levels: on
the level of definition/description or on the level of norma-
tive approaches, for example. In the second place, within
each level, various approaches can be observed. For exam-
ple, there are multiple interpretations of what is going on if
learning occurs, and there is not a single Bible-based norma-
tive approach toward the enhancement of faith learning, for
example; there are multiple approaches. Thus, it can be con-
cluded that clarification of the concept of learning in practi-
cal theological reflections on youth and religion is helped by
showing learning is multilayered. Therefore, learning can be
de Kock 9
clarified from the angle of different levels. This is what the
analysis in the current article shows.
A second conclusion, then, is that four types of descrip-
tions or approaches to learning can be distinguished. The
first type concentrates on the relational basis: Faith learning
is a relational process, a process embedded in the encounter
with God and other people, both inter- and intragenerational.
The second type concentrates on the process of acquiring
principles of faith and mainly cognitive religious/faith con-
tent as supplied by leaders or the tradition. The third type
concentrates on the process of the individual believer subjec-
tively constructing the (religious) self, based on independent
critical thinking. The fourth type concentrates on the process
of "faith in action," involving doing, experiencing, and inter-
acting socially in faith practices, including the lives of one-
self and others.
The third conclusion is that four general interpretations of
the process of learning can be distinguished. First, learning is
understood as a cognitive process of exploring ideas, convic-
tions, and beliefs and making commitments to one or the
other. Second, learning is understood as a process of action
in which practices, behavior, and actions are explored and
commitments to one or the other are made. Third, learning is
understood as a social process: Learning is relational and
intergenerational, and thus a product of (a fluid combination
of) socialization strategies and individual choices. Fourth,
learning is understood as a communal quality: Learning is
embedded in the daily life contexts of communities, and thus
not an individual but a collective process.
The fourth conclusion is that at least three theological
interpretations in particular can be distinguished: Learning
processes are shaped by (a) goal setting, (b) the place of reli-
gious authority, and (c) theological and denominational
positions.
The fifth conclusion is that in addition to normative ideals
stemming from different educational learning theories, differ-
ent biblical-theological concepts appear to be (theologically)
foundational to learning and the guidance of learning. I
showed examples of a discipleship approach and the theology
of Paul. Two approaches can be observed: One might opt for
one core biblical-theological approach to lead; one might also
choose to follow a patchwork approach in which ideals and
theological normative approaches are context dependent.
In addition, the sixth conclusion is that different strategic
considerations are to be dealt with. Special attention, then,
should be given to the role of the teacher, whether he or she
is the pastor, parent, youth leader, or peer. These teachers as
practical theologians are not simply applying normative
standpoints or putting definitions of learning into practice.
They are, instead, involved in a creative process with "rules
of art" (Osmer, 2005, p. xvi) that arise contextually in a con-
frontation between observations, interpretations, and norma-
tive positions. And this brings us back to the first conclusion
that showed learning was a multilayered concept, to be clari-
fied and dealt with from the angle of different levels. This is
a creative process for academics and practitioners in the field
of faith practices of young people.
Gaining clarity on descriptions, interpretations, normative
positions, and strategic considerations regarding learning
can advance practical theological reflections and empirical
research on youth and religion in which learning processes
are debated. The same is true for practitioners in the field of
religious education that involves all kinds of contexts: The
different definitions, approaches, and ideals regarding learn-
ing as presented in the article can be used to reflect on our
own professional practices and can be of help when we
develop learning environments for (faith) learning. Dealing
with descriptions, interpretations, normative positions, and
strategic considerations is in line with the four main tasks for
the practical theologian, whether he or she is an academic
involved in research or a practitioner in a particular profes-
sional field, as elaborated by Osmer (2005, 2008): (a) the
descriptive-empirical task, (b), the interpretative task, (c) the
normative task, and (d) the pragmatic task. Of special impor-
tance for the practical theologian is of course to bring into
discussion the theological (biblical, systematic, or springing
from lived religion) considerations with the educational/
pedagogical, psychological, and sociological reflections on
learning, in the interpretative task and in the normative task.
The latter brings us to the final (seventh) conclusion that
can be based in the analysis in the current article thus far:
Clarification of the concept of learning should be seen in
light of an epistemological perspective, a perspective that is
part of what Osmer (2011) calls "meta-theoretical consider-
ations" of the practical theologian. This is important because
a particular epistemological approach functions implicitly or
explicitly as a set of assumptions, grounded in either philoso-
phy, psychology, and/or theology, that shape theories on
(faith) learning. Criticizing a description of learning or an
educational model for enhancing learning is sometimes a cri-
tique on the level of assumptions: The assumptions are
wrong, and therefore, as a result, the description of learning
or the proposed educational model is wrong.
Epistemological approaches can focus on the nature of
knowledge or on how knowledge is acquired (Driscoll,
2000). Based on the work of Sfard (1998) and Paavola and
Hakkarainen (2005), we already distinguished three meta-
phors or epistemological approaches to learning: (a) the
acquisition metaphor, which characterizes learning as
"acquisition of something" directed toward the goal of indi-
vidual enrichment; (b) the participation metaphor, which
characterizes learning as "becoming a participant" and
directed toward the goal of community building; and (c) the
knowledge-creation metaphor, which characterizes learning
as a process of deliberately creating and advancing knowl-
edge directed toward developing collaborative shared objects
and artifacts.
Driscoll (2000), for example, distinguishes three main
epistemological traditions, each giving distinct orientations on
how to understand learning: objectivism, pragmatism,
10 SAGE Open
and interpretivism. Is "reality" out there, and if it is, is it to be
considered as external to and separate from the knower, is it
knowable directly or indirectly, or is it a construction of indi-
vidual knowers? Such questions are, in the words of Osmer
(2011), questions on the "meta-theoretical" level, answers to
which shape the way in which the descriptive, interpretative,
normative, and pragmatic tasks of practical theologians are
performed.
Assumptions about the nature of learning and how knowl-
edge is acquired influence the views one has about learning.
Furthermore, the assumptions religious educators, pastors,
youth workers, or parents have also affect how likely they
are motivated to take certain strategic considerations seri-
ously. Professionals or volunteers who hold objectivist
assumptions on learning hold reality as external and objec-
tive and believe knowledge can be acquired through experi-
ence. Those who hold a pragmatist position hold reality as
interpreted through signs, both internal and external, in
which knowledge is negotiated from experience and reason.
The interpretivists among all those involved in (faith) learn-
ing see reality as an internal thing, relative to a frame of ref-
erence where knowledge is constructed. Epistemological
approaches that guide individuals in dealing with learning
and the enhancement of learning are often rooted in broader
developments in cultures, societies, or church denomina-
tional subcultures. For example, a knowledge-creation meta-
phor or interpretivism is observed in innovative missionary
church contexts where new faith practices are constructed, in
terms of structures and theologies. The (cultural) develop-
ment here is one of secularization and the decline of partici-
pation in institutional church practices. As a counterreaction,
religious professionals and volunteers critique the dominant
voice of the acquisition of church dogmas when it comes to
church education and replace this voice by stressing the indi-
vidual construction of religious truth based on their own
interpretations of experiences.
I suggest that further practical theological research on
learning of young people in faith practices can be helped
with explicit clarifications from the outset of what is meant
by "learning" or what can be observed about "learning" in
terms of descriptions, interpretations, and normative posi-
tions and strategy, as well as from a broader epistemological
perspective. In particular, I suggest more empirical research
into the experiences of young people in faith practices and to
gain more understanding of the concept of learning based on
their experiences, using concepts and language from the
young people themselves. Reflections on learning in the dif-
ferent OJKC studies, for example, appeared to be based on a
mix of theoretical considerations and visions of educators
(e.g., catechists), and only partly on direct interactions with
young people themselves. I ask for more empirical studies on
learning in faith practices in which the voice of young people
themselves is the foundation.
This plea is in line with Schweitzer (2014) who recently
presented six criteria for gaining additional understanding of
religion. These criteria are also relevant for understanding
the learning of young people in faith practices. One crite-
rion is that the understanding of religion must "be open for
the special experiences of children and adolescents and
should not make the religion its tacit model (`adultocen-
trism')" (Schweitzer, 2014, p. 32). Another criterion taken
from Schweitzer is that the understanding of religion must
"combine non-religious interpretive perspectives with the
openness for the religious self-understandings of believers,
particularly of children and adolescents" (p. 32). The plea
is also in line with Faix's (2014) observation that "more
research needs to be undertaken in the future with regard to
the methodological approach of using mixed methods and
also in relation to adolescents' ability to speak about and
understand their own faith constructs" (p. 51). Especially
in societies where predefined frameworks of faith, reli-
gion, and faith institutions are losing ground, young peo-
ple's self-understanding of faith and faith learning becomes
more important to describe and interpret the essence of
what learning is about. The special role of the practical
theologian is to observe and listen intensely, and to bring
these empirical data, which are the experiences and voices
of young people themselves, in debate with both tradi-
tional and new, both theological and nontheological inter-
pretative and normative frameworks, with the goal of
strategically serving the learning function of current faith
communities.
