Triclosan (2,4,4´-trichloro-2´-hydroxy-
diphenyl ether) is a synthetic, broad-spectrum
antimicrobial agent that has been used exten-
sively for more than 20 years in a variety of
consumer products, including toothpaste,
mouthwash, deodorants, soaps, textiles (e.g.,
socks, underwear), toys, liquid dishwashing
soap, and plastic kitchenware (Adolfsson-
Erici et al. 2002; Bhargava and Leonard
1996; Jones et al. 2000; National Library of
Medicine 2007; Perencevich et al. 2001). In
Europe, about 350 tons of triclosan are pro-
duced annually for commercial applications
(Singer et al. 2002). In the United States,
76% of 395 commercial soaps examined con-
tained triclosan (Perencevich et al. 2001).
Despite its widespread use, the efficacy of tri-
closan-containing products in household and
other non-health care­related settings and the
potential hazards associated with this use,
such as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, are the subject of an ongoing scien-
tific and public debate (Aiello et al. 2007;
Jones et al. 2000; Kampf and Kramer 2004;
Russell 2003; Weber and Rutala 2006;
Yazdankhah et al. 2006).
Triclosan has been detected in the aquatic
environment and in some food sources
(Lindstrom et al. 2002; Lopez-Avila and
Hites 1980; McAvoy et al. 2002; Okumura
and Nishikawa 1996; Singer et al. 2002), and
has attracted interest as an environmental
contaminant (Halden and Paull 2005). In
frogs, triclosan can disrupt thyroid hormone-
associated gene expression and induce changes
in the thyroid hormone-mediated meta-
morphosis process (Veldhoen et al. 2006).
Triclosan can also alter circulating serum con-
centrations of total thyroxine in rats (Crofton
et al. 2007). Triclosan is not acutely toxic to
mammals (Bhargava and Leonard 1996), but it
can interact with cytochrome P450­dependent
enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and
the human pregnane X receptor (Hanioka et al.
1996; Jacobs et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2004).
The relevance of these interactions is unknown.
Information about the known commercial
uses of triclosan indicates that ingestion and
dermal absorption are the most likely routes of
exposure (Moss et al. 2000; Sandborgh-
Englund et al. 2006). Radioactive triclosan is
excreted in feces, and to a lesser extent in
urine, after topical exposure in rats (Moss
et al. 2000) and oral administration in mice
(Kanetoshi et al. 1988). The extent of dermal
absorption of triclosan was examined both
in vitro and in vivo in rats and humans (Moss
et al. 2000). In vitro, 24 hr after application,
about 6.3% of triclosan had penetrated
human skin compared with 23% for rat skin.
These data suggest that dermal absorption of
triclosan in humans is lower than in rats. In all
cases, glucuronidation and to a lesser extent
sulfation of triclosan occurred during passage
through the skin. No oxidative metabolites
were detected in the urine in vivo or after
absorption through skin in vitro; the major
urinary metabolites were triclosan glucuronide
and sulfate (Moss et al. 2000). In another
study, 10 healthy adult Swedish volunteers
(50% males; median age, 28 years) were
exposed to a single oral dose of 4 mg triclosan
by swallowing an oral mouthwash solution,
and the volunteers' plasma and urinary con-
centrations of triclosan were determined
(Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006). Triclosan
concentrations in plasma increased rapidly,
with a maximum concentration within
1­3 hr; the estimated terminal plasma half-life
was 21 hr. The major fraction of the triclosan
dose was excreted in urine within the first
24 hr (calculated urinary excretion half-life
was 11 hr), and approached baseline levels
within 8 days after exposure. A median oral
dose of 54% was excreted in urine within the
first 4 days after exposure. The percentage of
free triclosan in plasma was higher than in
urine; in urine, triclosan was excreted mostly
in its conjugated forms. These data suggest
that the concentrations of triclosan in urine
(conjugated and free species) can be used as
biomarkers of exposure to triclosan.
The widespread use of triclosan has raised
interest about assessing human exposure to this
compound. Therefore, we measured the uri-
nary concentration of triclosan in participants
of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003­2004
to obtain the first nationally representative
concentration of triclosan in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Triclosan is a synthetic chemical with broad antimicrobial activity that has been
used extensively in consumer products, including personal care products, textiles, and plastic
kitchenware.
OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess exposure to triclosan in a representative sample
 6 years of age of the U.S. general population from the 2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: We analyzed 2,517 urine samples using automated solid-phase extraction coupled to
isotope dilution­high-performance liquid chromatography­tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: We detected concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) triclosan in 74.6% of samples
at concentrations of 2.4­3,790 µg/L. The geometric mean and 95th percentile concentrations were
13.0 µg/L (12.7 µg/g creatinine) and 459.0 µg/L (363.8 µg/g creatinine), respectively. We observed
a curvilinear relation between age and adjusted least square geometric mean (LSGM) concentra-
tions of triclosan. LSGM concentrations of triclosan were higher in people in the high household
income than in people in low (p < 0.01) and medium (p = 0.04) income categories.
CONCLUSIONS: In about three-quarters of urine samples analyzed as part of NHANES 2003­2004,
we detected concentrations of triclosan. Concentrations differed by age and socioeconomic status
but not by race/ethnicity and sex. Specifically, the concentrations of triclosan appeared to be high-
est during the third decade of life and among people with the highest household incomes.

U.S. population (CDC 2003). The surveys
include household interviews, standardized
physical examinations, and collection of med-
ical histories and biologic specimens. Some of
these specimens are used to assess exposure to
environmental chemicals (CDC 2005).
NHANES 2003­2004 included examinations
of 9,643 people (CDC 2006a). Urine speci-
mens for analyses of triclosan were collected
from a random one-third subset of 2,517 par-
ticipants  6 years of age. Because the subset
was random, the representative design of the
survey was maintained. The National Centers
for Health Statistics Institutional Review
Board reviewed and approved the study pro-
tocol. Informed written consent was obtained
from all participants.
A single spot urine sample per participant
was collected during one of three daily exami-
nation session periods (i.e., morning, after-
noon, evening). The samples were shipped on
dry ice to CDC's National Center for
Environmental Health and stored at or below
­20°C until analyzed. We measured the con-
centrations of free plus conjugated triclosan,
in 100 µL of urine, by online solid-phase
extraction coupled to high-performance liq-
uid chromatography­isotope dilution­tandem
mass spectrometry, as described in detail else-
where (Ye et al. 2005). Briefly, the conjugated
species of triclosan were hydrolyzed by use of
50 µL of a solution (4,000 µg/mL) of
-glucuronidase/sulfatase (Helix pomatia,
463,000U/g solid; Sigma Chemical Co.,
St. Louis, MO) in 1 M ammonium acetate
pH 5 buffer (Sigma Chemical Co.). After
hydrolysis, samples were acidified with 0.1M
formic acid; triclosan was preconcentrated by
online solid-phase extraction, separated from
other urine components by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography,
and detected by atmospheric pressure chemi-
cal ionization­tandem mass spectrometry.
The limit of detection (LOD)--calculated as
3S0
, where S0
is the standard deviation as the
concentration approaches zero (Taylor
1987)--was 2.3 µg/L; the precision ranged
from 14.3% to 23.2%. To minimize poten-
tial contamination with triclosan during the
laboratory operations, we avoided the use of
triclosan-containing soaps and detergents. In
addition, low-concentration (~ 40 µg/L) and
high-concentration (~ 230 µg/L) quality con-
trol materials, prepared with pooled human
urine, and reagent blanks (to monitor and
control for the potential contamination aris-
ing from the reagents and apparatus used)
were analyzed with analytical standards and
NHANES samples.
We performed statistical analyses using
SAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) and SUDAAN (version 9.0.1; RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC).
SUDAAN incorporates sample weights and
design variables to account for the complex
sample design of NHANES. We calculated the
percentage of detection, the geometric mean,
and distribution percentiles for both the vol-
ume-based (in micrograms per liter) and creati-
nine-corrected (in micrograms per gram
creatinine) concentrations. For concentrations
below the LOD, as recommended for the
analysis of NHANES data (CDC 2006b), we
used a value equal to the LOD divided by the
square root of 2 (Hornung and Reed 1990).
We used analysis of covariance to examine
the influence of several variables, selected on
the basis of statistical, demographic, and bio-
logic considerations, on the concentrations of
triclosan. For the multiple regression models,
we used the variables described below and all
possible two-way interactions to calculate the
adjusted least square geometric mean (LSGM)
concentrations (in micrograms per liter),
which provide geometric mean estimates for a
variable after adjustment for the model covari-
ates. Because the distribution of the triclosan
concentrations was skewed, triclosan concen-
trations were log-transformed. A variable
based on self-reported data defined three
major racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic
black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican
American. Self-reported annual household
income was available in $5,000 increments
(ranging from < $5,000 to > $75,000). To
obtain comparable numbers of participants in
each income group, we categorized income as
< $20,000, $20,000­$45,000, and > $45,000.
Those participants who had serum cotinine
concentrations (the biomarker used to define
smoking status) > 10 µg/L were classified as
smokers. Creatinine concentrations were log-
transformed for the data analysis because of
their skewed distribution. Age was reported in
years at the previous birthday. Because body
mass index (BMI) is age- and sex-specific for
people < 19 years of age, CDC recommends
for children and teens the use of BMI-for-age
percentile (BMIPCT) instead of BMI
(Kuczmarski et al. 2002). Therefore, we con-
ducted two separate models: one for adults
( 20 years of age) and one for children and
teenagers (6­19 years of age). We could not
include only children (6­11 years of age) in
the model because of the small sample size for
some strata. We considered age (continuous),
sex, race/ethnicity, creatinine concentration
(Barr et al. 2005), and income for both mod-
els. Additionally, for the adult model, we
included smoking status and BMI, and for the
Calafat et al.

children and teens model, we included
BMIPCT. When both age and age-squared
were in the model, to avoid multicollinearity
we centered age by subtracting the mean age
from each participant's age (Bradley and
Srivastava 1979). To evaluate the relation
between the log-transformed concentration of
triclosan and age, we estimated the weighted
geometric mean and LSGM concentrations
after adjusting by the other covariates in the
model, and we generated a bar chart of tri-
closan concentrations by age group.
To reach the final model, we used back-
ward elimination, with a threshold of
p < 0.05 for retaining the variable in the
model, using Satterwaite-adjusted F statistics.
We evaluated for potential confounding by
adding each of the excluded variables back
into the final model one by one and examin-
ing changes in the  coefficients of the statis-
tically significant main effects. If addition of
one of these excluded variables caused a
change in a  coefficient by  10%, the vari-
able was re-added to the model.
Results
Free plus conjugated species of triclosan (total
triclosan) were detected in 74.6% of the 2,517
urine samples from NHANES 2003­2004 at
concentrations ranging from above 2.3 µg/L
to 3,790 µg/L (2,644 µg/g creatinine). The
geometric mean and 95th percentile concen-
trations were 13.0 µg/L (12.7 µg/g creatinine)
and 459.0 µg/L (363.8 µg/g creatinine),
respectively (Table 1).
The children and adolescents model
included age (p = 0.4), age-squared (p = 0.04),
income, log-transformed creatinine, race/
ethnicity, and interaction terms between race/
ethnicity and income (p = 0.04) and log-
transformed creatinine and income (p =
0.02). However, the relatively low frequency
of detection of triclosan (55%) in one of the
combination groups (non-Hispanic whites
with $20,000­$45,000 household income),
although with sufficient sample size, resulted
in a biased low LSGM and hence in the signif-
icant interaction term between race/ethnicity
and income. Therefore, we repeated the multi-
ple regression analyses without these interac-
tion terms. The final model included income
(p = 0.0014), log-transformed creatinine
(p < 0.001), age (p = 0.12), and age-squared
(p = 0.014) (Table 2). We observed both an
accelerated increasing relationship between the
log-transformed triclosan concentration and
age ( coefficient for age-squared = 0.006),
and a linear increasing relationship between the
log-transformed triclosan and creatinine con-
centrations ( coefficient = 0.0002). People in
the < $20,000 income group had lower LSGM
[95% confidence interval (CI)] triclosan
concentrations [9.3 µg/L (6.8­12.7 µg/L)]
than those in the > $45,000 income group
[15.7 µg/L (11.8­20.8 µg/L)]. People in the
$20,000­$45,000 income group had the
lowest LSGM concentrations [7.7 µg/L
(5.6­10.8 µg/L)]. The frequency of detection
of triclosan varied by income group [63.7%
($20,000­$45,000); 78.7% (< $20,000); and
76.8% (> $45,000)].
In the adult model, log-transformed crea-
tinine, income, and age were significant
(Table 2). Triclosan LSGM concentrations
(95% CI) increased with household income
and were significantly lower for people in the
low household income category [10.2 µg/L
(8.5­12.2 µg/L)] than for people in the
medium [13.8 µg/L (10.9­17.4 µg/L); p =
0.02] and high [15.5 µg/L (13.7­17.5 µg/L);
p = 0.01] income categories; the differences in
LSGM concentrations between people in the
medium and high household income cate-
gories were not statistically significant (p =
0.38). Triclosan concentrations decreased as
age increased ( coefficient = ­0.004) and
increased as creatinine (log-transformed)
increased ( coefficient = 0.58).
Because BMI or BMIPCT and smoking
status were not significantly associated with
the triclosan concentration in the models
above, we combined the two models for all
ages without including these variables. In the
final all-ages model, log-transformed creati-
nine, household income, age, and age-squared
were significant (Table 2). The LSGM
urinary triclosan concentration (in micro-
grams per liter) increased as income increased:
Participants in the high household income
category had significantly higher LSGM
(95% CI) triclosan concentrations [15.3
(13.7­17.3)] than participants in the low-
[10.3 (9.1­11.6); p < 0.01] and medium-
[12.2 (10­14.9); p = 0.04] income categories.
However, differences in LSGM concentra-
tions between people in the medium and low-
est household income categories were not
statistically significant (p = 0.13). The tri-
closan concentrations increased as creatinine
(log-transformed) increased ( coefficient =
0.63). Figure 1 shows the relationship of
triclosan concentrations with age.
The univariate analyses showed that
regardless of the examination session time, the
geometric mean triclosan concentrations were
not significantly different (all p-values
> 0.25). Furthermore, the final multiple
regression model did not include examination
session time (p = 0.22). These results suggest
that the time of collection of the sample was
not associated with the urinary concentration
of triclosan.
Discussion
We detected concentrations of free plus conju-
gated species of triclosan in urine in 74.6% of
the samples examined. This high frequency of
detection is most likely associated with daily

use by the U.S. general population of con-
sumer products that contain triclosan, includ-
ing at least one toothpaste brand (Food and
Drug Administration 1997), skin-care prod-
ucts (e.g., soap, deodorant, skin cleanser), and
other household products (e.g., pet care, clean-
ers) (National Library of Medicine 2007). In
humans, triclosan can be absorbed through
skin (Moss et al. 2000) and through the
mucosa in the mouth and intestinal tract (Lin
2000; Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006). The
detection of triclosan in blood (Hovander et al.
2002; Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006), urine
(Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006; Wolff et al.
2007; Ye et al. 2005), and milk (Allmyr et al.
2006) collected from small groups of persons
in the United States and Sweden suggests that
the general population is exposed to triclosan.
The range of urinary concentrations of tri-
closan in the NHANES 2003­2004 sample
was wide, with 25% of persons examined hav-
ing concentrations < 2.3 µg/L, and 5% of the
participants having concentrations > 363.8 µg/g
creatinine (Table 1). A wide distribution of
concentrations of triclosan has also been
reported for 10 healthy Swedish volunteers, five
of whom related using personal-hygiene prod-
ucts that contained triclosan (Sandborgh-
Englund et al. 2006). In the Swedish study, the
baseline urinary excretion of triclosan (deter-
mined from 24-hr urine samples) was 0.1­743
µg/day among people not using triclosan-con-
taining products, and 21­218 µg/day among
users of triclosan-containing products. In
another Swedish study involving a group of 36
nursing women, triclosan concentrations were
higher in both plasma and milk among the
women who used personal care products con-
taining triclosan than in the women who did
not (Allmyr et al. 2006). These data suggest
that personal care products may be a principal
source of exposure to triclosan in humans. The
wide range of concentrations of triclosan may
be attributable to differences in exposure, as
well as to individual variations in distribution
kinetics and metabolism (Sandborgh-Englund
et al. 2006).
Data are limited on the urinary concen-
trations of triclosan in human populations. In
a pilot study, triclosan was detected in 67.8%
of 90 prepubertal girls, with mean age of 7.77
years, from New York City, New York;
Cincinnati, Ohio; and Northern California
(Wolff et al. 2007). The median concentra-
tion (5.9 µg/L) was comparable to the median
concentration of triclosan for the 341 chil-
dren 6­11 years of age in this NHANES
2003­2004 population (7.2 µg/L).
As is true for other nonpersistent chemi-
cals (Fenske et al. 2005; Hauser et al. 2004;
Hoppin et al. 2002; Meeker et al. 2005),
within-person variability in urinary concen-
trations of triclosan exists. Despite this vari-
ability, results from one recent study suggest
that triclosan concentrations in a single urine
sample can be used to categorize the 6-month
average exposure to triclosan among a group
of 35 children (Teitelbaum et al. 2007). More
important, concentrations based on one spot
sample per person can be useful in calculating
mean population concentration estimates in
cross-sectional studies such as NHANES.
We observed a curvilinear-increased rela-
tion between age and triclosan LSGM concen-
tration for people  6 years of age. For people
 20 years of age, concentrations appeared to
decline as age increases (Figure 1 and Table 2).
These data suggest that the concentrations of
urinary species of triclosan peak around the
third decade of life and then slowly decrease.
This relation between age and triclosan con-
centration is not clearly understood, and these
differences might reflect differences in lifestyle
choices affecting exposure and/or pharmaco-
kinetic factors based on age.
We did not observe differences in the
adjusted LSGM concentrations of triclosan
based on race/ethnicity or sex. LSGM tri-
closan concentrations were significantly
higher among people in the high household
income category than among people in the
medium (p = 0.04) and low (p < 0.01)
income categories. These differences might
reflect differences in lifestyle choices (e.g., use
of personal care products) that affect exposure
to triclosan.
In summary, these NHANES 2003­2004
triclosan data can be used to establish a nation-
ally representative baseline assessment of
exposure, a baseline to which the triclosan con-
centrations in future populations can be com-
pared to identify exposure trends. The reported
high frequency of detection of triclosan and
the differences in urinary concentrations based
on age and socioeconomic status highlight the
importance of additional research to identify
the sources and potential routes of human
exposure to triclosan. In addition, these data
provide exposure information that can be
useful for risk assessment if toxicologic or
epidemiologic studies so indicate.
