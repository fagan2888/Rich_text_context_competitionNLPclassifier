Despite their effectiveness, the use of behavioral techniques
in the classroom has decreased since their height of popular-
ity in the 1970s (Saville, Zinn, Neef, Van Norman, & Ferreri,
2006). Bryan Saville and his colleagues identified four pos-
sible factors contributing to this declining use of behavior
principles, including (a) an instructor's resistance to change,
(b) incompatibility between program requirements and the
academic calendar, (c) the increased workload required by
some behavioral systems, and (d) lower confidence in the
success of behavioral systems following misuse or misap-
plication. Perhaps in response to these criticisms, researchers
have started looking for ways to incorporate variations on
behavioral principles to today's classroom. Among these
variations is contract grading.
Contract grading is a system in which students determine
and specify at the beginning of a class the grade they would
like to earn, from a set of instructor-defined parameters.
Although there are a myriad of ways to implement contract
grading, in general, the following components are employed:
(a) assignments are graded pass or fail; (b) a mastery crite-
rion (often between 80% and 100%) is determined by the
instructor, and meeting this criterion is required to obtain a
passing grade; (c) students are provided multiple attempts to
earn a passing grade for each assignment; and (d) students
choose from a variety of assignments.
The use of contract grading is supported by wide-ranging
benefits. Students may be better able to monitor their prog-
ress, feel they have a greater role in their learning, and are
more likely to perceive primary control over their grade
(Grau, 1999; Kirschenbaum & Wetter Riechmann, 1975;
Polczynski & Shirland, 1977). As such, contract graded stu-
dents may be more motivated to perform well. In addition,
when assignments are graded pass or fail, emphasis is placed
on mastery of the material, as opposed to gaining a partial
understanding of the material. And, despite its novelty, stu-
dents may also prefer contract grading to traditional points-
based grading systems (Bunn Hiller & Hietapelto, 2001;
Kirschenbaum & Wetter Riechmann, 1975).
Among the few studies used to compare the effects of con-
tract grading and traditional grading approaches, the data sup-
port using contract grading or its components (see Johnston &
ONeill, 1973; Kirschenbaum & Wetter Riechmann, 1975;
Semb, 1974). Despite these promising findings, contract grad-
ing appears to be rarely used in classrooms today. In addition,
relative to the 1970s, many professors employ technologies not
previously available, such as computer-based lecture presenta-
tions and use of online course management systems. More
important, however, is the impact technological changes, in
general, occurring over the past decades (e.g., computers, cel-
lular phones) have had on college students. For example, stu-
dents today were born after widespread adoption of the Internet
and are accustomed to receiving information and communica-
tions immediately via text messaging and Internet phones.
Because of these technological and resulting cultural changes,

Use of Contract Grading to Improve
Grades Among College Freshmen in
Introductory Psychology
Dana F. Lindemann1 and Colin R. Harbke1
Abstract
The use of behavioral techniques in college teaching has declined during the past three decades.The purpose of this study was
to compare a behaviorally based grading approach with a traditional point-based system. A total of 40 college freshmen were
randomly assigned to aTraditionally Graded or Contract Graded Introductory Psychology course. Contract graded students
were one third as likely to fail or withdraw, 3 times more likely to earn an A grade, and were more likely to perceive a high
degree of control over their grade.These findings support use of a contract grading system in the contemporary college
classroom.

and their influence on young adults (see, for example, Twenge
& Campbell, 2001), there exists a need to systematically evalu-
ate and confirm the effectiveness of contract grading approaches
in the contemporary classroom. In particular, the question
remains, "Is contract grading, as a teaching technology, as effec-
tive and applicable in today's classrooms, and today's students,
as it was 40 years ago?" To that end, the purpose of this research
is to evaluate and compare contract grading and traditional
points-based grading systems on course performance and pref-
erences among college freshmen in a contemporary classroom.
Method
Participants and Setting
Participants were 16 male and 24 female college freshmen
attending a rural, state university. Participants were enrolled
in the survey course, "Introduction to Psychology," which
was also designated a First Year Experience (FYE) course.
The FYE program is designed to ease students' transition
from high school to college and to increase retention
between the freshmen and sophomore years. FYE courses
have small class sizes and in addition to the required cur-
riculum, emphasis is placed on learning outside of the class-
room through service and cocurricular events. All students
attending their freshmen year were required to register for at
least one designated FYE course.
Contract Grading Components
and Course Materials
Each of the common components of contract grading were
utilized: (a) assignments were graded pass or fail, (b) a mas-
tery criterion of 85% was required to earn a passing grade,
(c) students were allowed up to two submissions to earn a
passing grade for each assignment, and (d) students choose
from a variety of assignments.
Course assignments included writing selections, activi-
ties, and exams. Each writing selection equaled approxi-
mately three pages of text and required students to engage in
some task and then write about their experiences (e.g., create
and present a poster describing a published research study).
Activity selections included in-class activities as well as par-
ticipating in university events or psychology-related research
outside of class. Four of the exams covered three chapters of
material each and consisted of matching, fill-in-the-blank,
multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. The fifth
and final exam was cumulative over the semester and con-
sisted of matching and multiple-choice questions.
Requirements for each grade were explained on the grade
contract (see appendix). Students identified the grade they
wanted to contract for and then selected the writing and activ-
ity assignments they would complete to accomplish this goal.
The appropriate criterion for passing exams was marked, and
student and instructor signed the contract.
Measures
Student retention and course grades were recorded as pri-
mary dependent variables. As both these variables were
based on the official university roster at the beginning of the
semester, these dependent variables were available for all 40
students involved in the study.
Secondary measures came from three self-report ques-
tionnaires designed to evaluate the course, instructor effec-
tiveness, and student perceptions of their own effort. For the
first questionnaire, students were asked to "grade" their
instructor (A, B, C, D, or F) on 9 items, such as "Grade the
instructor's ability to provide a challenging course," and
"Grade the clearness of the course requirements and grading
procedures." The second questionnaire (23 items) asked
students to rate the frequency of specific behaviors by the
instructor or student as it pertained to the course (response
scale ranged from 1 = hardly ever to 5 = almost always).
Example items include, "The instructor clearly defined stu-
dents' responsibilities," and "I worked hard for the grades I
received in this class." For the third questionnaire, students
also rated their agreement with 12 statements about the
course format and content (response scale ranged from 1 =
disagree strongly to 5 = agree strongly), such as "I enjoyed
the format of the course" and "The overall workload for this
course was too much."
An additional outcome measure was taken from the aver-
age response to a self-report question regarding students'
perceived control over their grade: "On a scale from 1 (not at
all in control) to 10 (almost entirely in control), how much
control do you believe you personally had over your grade in
this class?"
Procedure
At the outset of the semester, the instructor randomly assigned
students enrolled in one course section to the Contract
Grading Group (n = 20) and those enrolled in the other section
to the Traditional Grading Group (n = 20). Both sections were
taught by the same instructor, who at the time had 6 years of
college teaching experience. With the exception of the con-
tract grading elements (including the ability to resubmit an
assignment), all of the lectures, writing and activity assign-
ments,andexamswereidenticalinbothsections.Requirements
for each grade were determined such that any grade was
comparable between sections (i.e., an A in the contract grad-
ing course was comparable with an A in the traditional grad-
ing course).
The grading structures were described in the syllabus cor-
responding to each section and reviewed in class during the
1st week of the semester. Students in the Contract Grading
Group submitted a signed contract during the 1st week of
class and, if necessary, were allowed to modify their contract
during Week 10 of the semester. Students in the Traditional
Grading Group received points for each assignment, and
Lindemann and Harbke 3
grades were based on the percentage of total points earned
(an A for 90% or higher, B for 80%-89%, etc.). Grades for
students in the Contract Grading Group were based on the
number of writing assignments, activities, and exams that
received a passing grade (see appendix). When a writing or
activity submission did not receive a passing grade, the stu-
dent was informed of what changes were needed, and one
resubmission was allowed to reach the mastery criterion. For
exams, students who did not pass the first attempt viewed
their graded exam for 10 min and were allowed a second
attempt 2 days later to reach the mastery criterion (i.e., 80%
correct responses). All assignments were graded by a gradu-
ate teaching assistant, who was blind to the manipulation.
During the penultimate week of the semester, students
were asked to complete the three self-report measures and
the perceived control item by a graduate student who was
blind to the study and manipulation. To complete these self-
report measures, students needed to be still enrolled in the
course and present in class on the day they were adminis-
tered. As such, self-report data were available from a total of
28 students, with 15 contract grading (75% of initial enroll-
ment) and 13 traditional grading students (65% of initial
enrollment) completing these measures. Responses to the
self-report measures were anonymous and the instructor was
not present during administration. Aggregate mean scores
for each self-report measure as well as inspection of repre-
sentative items from the student and instructor behavior
measure and the course format and content measure were
used to compare student opinions and experiences at the end
of the semester.
Results and Discussion
The purpose of this research is to evaluate and compare
contract grading and traditional points-based grading sys-
tems on course performance and preferences among college
freshmen in a contemporary classroom. Categorical data for
both groups were summarized with percentages and com-
pared between groups using the relative risk (RR) ratio.
Students in the Contract Grading Group (60%) were 3 times
more likely than those in the Traditional Grading Group
(20%) to earn an A grade in the course, RR = 3.00, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = [1.16, 7.73], p = .01. In addition,
Contract Grading students (15%) were one third as likely
(RR = 0.33, 95% CI = [0.11, 1.05], p = .04) to attrit through
course withdrawal or failing grades than Traditional Grading
students (45%).
For the nine-item teaching evaluation for which students
"graded" the instructor's performance and the course, the
average grade was approximately one half of a letter grade
higher for the contract grading class (M = 3.61 on a 4-point
scale) than for the traditional grading class, M = 3.21.
Quantitative data were summarized with group means and
compared using independent-samples t tests. Students in the
Contract Grading Group consistently rated the instructor's
and their behaviors toward the course more favorably. All 23
behaviors described on the first questionnaire received higher
average endorsements by the Contract Grading Group than
the Traditional Grading Group. And, averaged across the 23
items, this difference amounted to a mean rating that was 1.45
standard deviations higher for the Contract Grading Group
(M = 4.51, SD = 0.58) than for the Traditional Grading Group
(M = 3.80, SD = 0.38), t(26) = 3.74, p < .001. The upper half
of Figure 1 displays the mean ratings for six representative
itemsandanaggregatescorefortheentirescale.Representative
behavior items were selected based with emphasis on likely
areas of both similarity and differences between the Contract
Grading and Traditional Grading Groups. As both groups
received the same exams, for instance, little differences were
expected to the item "Course exams related to the material";
in contrast, larger differences were expected for items related
to clarity of expectations (e.g., "Student responsibilities
clearly defined" or "Class and assignments clearly orga-
nized"). The average item-total correlation, using Fisher's
(1921) r-to-z conversion, for the six representative items were
higher (mean interitem r = .82, range = .28-.93) than those for
items that were not selected (mean r = .67, range = .04-.91).
A similar pattern emerged for the 12 statements regard-
ing the course format and content (see bottom half of
Figure 1) where the average difference was nearly one
standard deviation (d = 0.97) higher for Contract Grading
Group (M = 4.05, SD = 0.76) than for the Traditional
Grading Group (M = 3.36, SD = 0.65), t(26) = 2.54, p = .017.
Figure 1 also includes scores for six representative format
and content items. As before, representative items were
selected based on likely sources of difference between the
Contract Grading and Traditional Grading Groups, and the
average item-total correlations, following Fisher's (1921)
r-to-z conversions, were higher among the representative
items (mean r = .79, range = .50-.90) than nonrepresentative
items (mean r = .73, range = .07-.89).
When asked about the extent to which they felt in control
over their grades, 67% of students in the Contract Grading
Group reported a 9 or 10 (the maximum on the response
scale was 10, "almost entirely in control") compared with
only 23% of those in the Traditional Grading Group, RR =
2.89, 95% CI = [1.01, 8.30], p = .02. Viewed across the full
range of the scale, however, the mean ratings were similar
for both groups (Contract Grading: M = 8.5, SD = 2.18;
Traditional Grading: M = 8.04, SD = 1.27), d = 0.26, t(26) =
0.67, p = .51. Inspection of the response distributions for
both groups revealed that, although the majority of Contract
Grading students indicated a maximum or near maximum
amount of control of their grades, two contract grading stu-
dents (13%) indicated less control (i.e., 3 or 4) than any of
the traditional grading students, for which a response of 6
was the lowest.
To summarize briefly, students in the Contract Grading
Group were one third as likely to fail or withdraw, 3 times more
likely to earn an A grade, and, in general, were more likely to

perceive a high degree of control over their grade. In addition,
those in the Contract Grading Group consistently rated their
effort, the course, and the instructor more favorably.
These findings indicate that contract grading is applicable
to and effective in a contemporary college classroom, among
today's college students. In addition, contract grading was
implemented with few changes to the preexisting material.
The methodology employed allows a direct comparison
between contract grading and traditional points-based grad-
ing systems. The nature of contract grading required
Lindemann and Harbke 5
variation in key course and evaluation components (e.g.,
student selection of assignments). Most notably, contract
grading permitted multiple attempts to achieve the mastery
criterion on assignments. Although this presents a funda-
mental methodological confound, the reliance on mastery
grading criteria is a key feature of contract grading, and
one-shot assessments are ubiquitous in traditional grading
approaches. As such, for the purposes of this evaluation, we
elected to implement both grading systems as they are most
typically employed in the classroom (i.e., mastery grading
with multiple attempts for contract grading students and
single-shot assessments for traditional grading students).
The findings as described above should be viewed in consid-
eration of this methodological limitation.
The use of both grading systems during the same semes-
ter introduces a possible alternative explanation for the
present findings. It is possible that traditional grading
students became aware that contract grading students
were able to select their own assignments, held to a mas-
tery criterion, and were permitted to resubmit course
assignments, including retaking exams. Awareness of the
evaluation differences between course sections may have
demoralized those students assigned to the Traditional
Grading Group and manifested in reduced motivation and
effort toward the course, course assignments, or in their
evaluation of the course on the self-report measures. As
assignment to the Contract or Traditional Grading Groups
was determined by course section and the instructor did
not share the details of the other grading system with the
students, methodological efforts were employed to mini-
mize this and other forms of participant reactivity.
Moreover, as FYE courses maintain small class sizes, the
40 students from the present evaluation represent a small
proportion of the total introductory psychology enrollment
that semester (<5%). Because of the low proportion of
total introductory psychology students who were enrolled
in the contract grading section (<2.5%), it is unlikely,
albeit still possible, that contract grading students shared
the details of their grading system with the other 2.5% of
students who were assigned to the Traditional Grading
Group in this evaluation. Despite some inherent differ-
ences between the evaluation components of the contract
grading and tradition grading systems, it should be noted
that instructor, graduate student grader, class day, course
materials, assignments and exams, and college year were
all held constant.
These findings echo those from previous contract grad-
ing studies. For example, consistent with Kirschenbaum
and Wetter Riechmann (1975), higher course evaluation
scores were reported by participants in the contract grad-
ing course. And, consistent with past research on perfor-
mance criteria (see Johnston & O'Neill, 1973; Semb,
1974), participants in the Contract Grading Group earned
higher grades than those in the Traditional Grading Group;
as such, the contract grading students appeared to have
matched their performance with the higher criteria for
earning a passing grade on each assignment (i.e., 85%).
Contract graded students in this study also self-reported
greater perceived control over their own grade, which fol-
lows a myriad of studies (Grau, 1999; Kirschenbaum &
Wetter Riechmann, 1975; Polczynski & Shirland, 1977). The
secondary measures (i.e., self-report measures related to the
course, instructor, and student effort) were summarized
with averages for brevity in the analyses. Nonetheless,
some key differences found in the literature between
traditional and contract grading are evident from com-
paring responses to the individual items described in
Figure 1. For example, contract grading students indi-
cated higher ratings for working hard for their grade,
enjoying the course format, and for enhancing indepen-
dent thinking. In addition, other items, not displayed in
Figure 1, show a similar pattern as depicted by the aggre-
gate score.
The outcome measures for the current comparison were
limited to course grades and retention, students'self-reported
perceived control over their grades, and course and teacher
evaluations. There are a variety of potentially interesting
dependent variables suitable for future research. One exam-
ple is student effort, perhaps operationalized as time spent
preparing for exams.Although there is evidence that contract
grading may in fact increase motivation and effort (e.g.,
Bunn Hiller & Hietapelto, 2001), in the present study, some
students in the Contract Grading Group may have prepared
less for the first attempt on each exam knowing that they
could repeat the exam a couple of days later. Although the
majority of contract grading students perceived more control
over their grade than their counterparts in the Traditional
Grading Group, this perception was not universal. In fact,
two contract grading students reported less control than any
of the traditional grading students. This difference suggests
important differences in individual student's reactions to and
experiences with contract grading. As such, analysis of the
individual differences in the effect of contract grading and its
impact on individual student performance is needed to fur-
ther explore this. The benefits of contract grading among
upper division students should also be explored, as it is pos-
sible that contract grading is even more beneficial among
older students, given the growth that often occurs during col-
lege. And, a meta-analysis of research on contract grading,
which has not yet been done, may draw much-needed atten-
tion to the effectiveness of this and other alternative grading
procedures.
In conclusion, the authors encourage faculty to consider
incorporating contract grading into their college courses.
Based on the present study, contract grading systems may
lead to higher grades, increased sense of control, and more
positive experiences with the course from the student's
perspective.
