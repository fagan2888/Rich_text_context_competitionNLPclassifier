Compared to women, younger males, and other racial/ethnic groups in the United States, white
males 65 and over have the highest suicide rates. Using the Mortality Detail Files (1989-1991),
this study examined the sociodemographic factors associated with late life firearm (vs other
methods) suicide among white males. White males aged 65-84 residing in nonmetropolitan
areas who were married, divorced, or widowed and with less than a high school education were
significantly more likely to have killed themselves with a firearm than with other methods. Policy
initiatives and community interventions should incorporate knowledge of those demographic
subgroups most at risk for firearm suicide.

Suicide Among Older White Males1
Mark S. Kaplan, DrPH,2 Margaret E. Adamek, PhD,2 and Olga Geling, MA2
Suicide among older males has received increasing
attention (e.g., Mclntosh, Santos, Hubbard, & Over-
holser, 1994; Mercer, 1989). Compared to women,
younger males, and other racial/ethnic groups in the
United States, white males 65 years and over have the
highest suicide rates -- 42.7 per 100,000 compared to
a national rate of 12.2 in 1991 (Mclntosh, 1995). The
high suicide risk among older white males prompted
the U.S. Public Health Service to include a mental
heath initiative targeted at reducing the suicide rate
in this group in its Healthy People 2000: National
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives
(NCHS, 1993).
In spite of the growing public attention to the
magnitude of this problem, little is known about the
sociodemographic factors associated with suicide in
later life. Preventive strategies should be guided by
an understanding of the demography of suicide (Cat-
tell & Jolley, 1995). While it is well known that older
white males often kill themselves with guns (e.g.,
Kaplan, Adamek, & Johnson, 1994), research has not
examined whether the likelihood of firearm suicide
varies across sociodemographic subgroups of this
population. Available studies tend to be based on
aggregate-level data (Baker, O'Neill, Ginsburg, &
Liu, 1992; Lester & Yang, 1992). Studies have exam-

ined social and economic correlates of suicide (e.g.,
Lester, 1993, 1994), but none has focused on the
group at the highest risk of suicide -- older white
males. And, few studies (e.g., Liu & Waterbor, 1994-
95) have compared the risk of firearm suicide vs other
methods. Adamek and Kaplan (1996) found that age
and race were correlates of firearm suicide among
older males, yet other factors -- such as socioeco-
nomic status, marital status, and urban vs rural resi-
dence -- have not been analyzed.
Although available studies are informative, the
question of which subgroups of older adults are
more likely to use firearms vs other methods to kill
themselves remains unanswered. The current study
overcomes the limitations of previous research by
analyzing the odds of suicide by firearm compared
with other methods across sociodemographic sub-
groups of older white males based on national,
individual-level data.
Methods
Data derive from the Mortality Detail Files (1989-
1991) compiled by the Division of Vital Statistics of
the National Center for Health Statistics from the
death certificate files reported by each state. Causes
of death were coded according to the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th revision, Clinical
Modification (NCHS, 1994). The following ICD codes
were used: E955.0-.4 (firearms), E950.0-.9 (poison-
ing), E951.0-.8 (domestic gas), E952.0-.9 (auto ex-
haust), E953.0-.9 (hanging), E954 (drowning), E956

(cutting and piercing), E957.0-.9 (jumping), and
E958.0-.9 (other and unspecified). Because of the
relatively low rate of suicide by methods other than
firearms, non-firearm methods were combined into
one category. Independent variables consisted of
age (65-74, 75-84, 85+ years), area of residence
(metropolitan, nonmetropolitan), marital status
(married, single, widowed, divorced), and education
(less than high school, high school graduate). Educa-
tion was used as a proxy measure of socioeconomic
status. Death certificate data on educational attain-
ment were first reported in 1989. Education has been
found to be a stronger determinant of morbidity and
mortality than other measures of social class (Hertz-
man, Frank, & Evans, 1994). Although some studies
(e.g., O'Donnell & Farmer, 1995) have highlighted
the limitations of official mortality statistics (i.e., un-
dercounts and misclassifications), other studies have
found death certificate data to be valid and reliable
(Havlik & Rosenberg, 1992; Sorlie, Rogot, & Johnson,
1992).
Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were
conducted. Descriptive statistics included actual
numbers and rates (derived from the number of
suicides divided by census estimates of the popula-
tions at risk) of suicide among older white males by
firearms and other methods. Multiple logistic regres-
sion analysis allowed the examination of the direct
effects of sociodemographic predictors of suicide by
firearm vs other methods after adjusting for potential
confounding factors. The resulting odds ratios com-
pared the likelihood of firearm suicide in the pres-
ence of a certain sociodemographic characteristic to
the likelihood of firearm suicide in the absence of
that characteristic. Odds ratios smaller or larger than
1.00 indicate a lesser or greater likelihood of firearm
suicide.
Results
Suicide by firearm was more prevalent than suicide
by other methods across all the sociodemographic
subgroups examined. Of the 14,887 cases of suicide
among elderly white males from 1989 through 1991,
77% were committed with firearms and 23% with
other methods. Table 1 presents the numbers and
rates of firearm and non-firearm suicides by socio-
demographic subgroups for the three-year period.
The overall rates of suicide for white males 65 and
over by firearms and non-firearms were 34.55 and
10.47 per 100,000, respectively.
Table 2 presents the adjusted odds ratios which
indicate the likelihood of using firearms vs non-
firearms to commit suicide across the subgroups.
The logistic regression analysis revealed four demo-
graphic subgroups at a significantly (p < .0001)
higher risk of firearm suicide.
Among suicide cases, firearms were significantly
more likely to have been used by white males 65
through 84 than by those 85 and over. Although the
firearm rate was highest in the 85 and over age group,
the proportion of those who killed themselves with a
gun was greater among males 65 to 84 (78%) than

among those 85 and over (70%) (Table 1). Place of
residence was significantly associated with the
choice of firearms. Nonmetropolitan residents were
twice as likely to have used firearms. Firearms were
significantly more likely to have been the method of
suicide among married, divorced, and widowed than
among single white males. Whereas married males
Vol.36, No. 4,1996 531
had lower rates than those who were single, the
proportion of suicides involving guns was higher
among married (78%) than among single (66%) males
(Table 1). Compared with individuals who have com-
pleted a high school education, those with less than a
12-year education were more likely to have com-
mitted suicide by firearms. In a separate analysis of
interactions, we found that the effects of residence,
marital status, and education on the use of firearms
vs other methods of suicide did not vary significantly
across the three age groups.
Discussion
Previous research has shown that white males age
65 and over have the highest suicide rate, and that
firearms are the most likely method used. The
present study identified specific demographic sub-
groups of this population most at risk for committing
suicide by firearm. After controlling for relevant fac-
tors, the analysis revealed that those who were of
lower socioeconomic status (as measured by educa-
tion); living in nonmetropolitan areas; married, di-
vorced, or widowed; and in the 65-84 age group
were more likely to choose firearms than other meth-
ods to kill themselves. These findings corroborate
and extend Liu and Waterbor's (1994-95) analysis of
mortality data from Alabama.
While among the three age groups, white males 85
and over had the highest rates of suicide -- both by
firearms and other methods -- they were signifi-
cantly less likely to use firearms than those 65 to 84.
Poor adjustment to physical and financial losses in
early retirement might help explain the increased
risk of suicide by firearms among young-old males.
According to Miller (1979), "retirement shock" is a
major precipitating factor in suicide of elderly males.
The greater likelihood of suicide by firearms among
older white men in nonmetropolitan areas may be
understood by their higher rate of gun ownership. In
an analysis of data from the 1989-1991 General Social
Survey (Davis & Smith, 1989-91), we found that
nearly 8 out of 10 white males 65 and over living in
rural areas reported gun ownership compared to 1
out of 2 in urban areas. Compared to single individ-
uals, married as well as widowed and divorced white
men were at greater risk of committing suicide by
firearm. Concern for leaving a spouse destitute due
to the economic burden of long-term illness (Butler,
Lewis, & Sunderland, 1991) or the stress of losing a
spouse through death or divorce may heighten the
determination of married, widowed, and divorced
males, respectively, to kill themselves and thus
choose a gun. As with nonmetropolitan residence,
lower socioeconomic status as a predictor of firearm
suicide may reflect in part the higher rate of gun
ownership: 64% of white males 65 and over without a
high school degree compared to 48% of those with a
high school degree (Davis & Smith, 1989-91).
Clearly, the prominence of firearms as a method of
suicide among older white males needs to be ac-
knowledged and responded to on a wider scale. The
rise in the number of older white males committing
suicide with firearms is particularly problematic be-
cause these highly lethal instruments provide little or
no chance for rescue (Kellermann, Lee, Mercy, &
Banton, 1991). The U.S. Public Health Service has set
a national goal of reducing the overall suicide rate in
this population by 8% to 39.2 per 100,000 by the year
2000 (NCHS, 1993, p. 50). Achieving this goal will
require solutions targeted at reducing the availability
of firearms (Sacks, Mercy, Ryan, & Parrish, 1994).
Several individuals have called for a public health
approach targeted at the environmental conditions,
i.e., firearm availability, contributing to the high rate
of suicide among older white males (e.g., Hendin,
1995; Mishara, 1993, Sorenson, 1991). Research has
shown that the rate of firearm suicide can be reduced
by limiting access to guns (Clarke & Lester, 1989;
Fischer, Comstock, Monk, & Sencer, 1993; Keller-
mann et al., 1991). Ready accessibility to guns in the
home increases the risk of firearm suicide (Keller-
mann et al., 1992). Clearly, effective preventive inter-
ventions require the identification of specific sub-
groups of older adults at greatest risk of firearm
suicide.
