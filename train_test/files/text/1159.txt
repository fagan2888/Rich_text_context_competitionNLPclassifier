SUICIDE IS ONE OF THE LEADING
causes of death worldwide. As a
result, the World Health Orga-
nization1 and the US surgeon
general2 have highlighted the need for
more comprehensive data on the occur-
rence of suicidal thoughts and at-
tempts,accordingtotheassumptionthat
such data would be useful for planning
national health care policy, as well as for
evaluating efforts to reduce suicide and
suicide-related behaviors. The latter are
among the official national health ob-
jectives in the United States.3 The as-
sumption that information on suicide-
related behaviors, including thoughts,
plans, gestures, and nonfatal attempts, is
important for understanding com-
pleted suicides can be called into ques-
tion because only a small fraction of sui-
cide attempters eventually complete
suicide.4 However, suicide attempts are
significantpredictorsofsubsequentcom-
pleted suicide, as well as important in
their own right as indicators of extreme
psychological distress.
Although the National Center for
Health Statistics maintains data on all
suicide deaths in the United States ac-
cording to death certificate records,5 no
national data are available on the 1-year
prevalence of trends in suicidal
thoughts or attempts. Current esti-
mates of such outcomes in the United
States are drawn from 2 main sources.
First, several ongoing surveillance sys-
tems have been established to moni-
tor suicide-related outcomes among na-
tionally representative samples of

Context Little is known about trends in suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, or at-
tempts or about their treatment. Such data are needed to guide and evaluate policies
to reduce suicide-related behaviors.
Objective To analyze nationally representative trend data on suicidal ideation, plans,
gestures, attempts, and their treatment.
Design, Setting, and Participants Data came from the 1990-1992 National Co-
morbidity Survey and the 2001-2003 National Comorbidity Survey Replication. These
surveys asked identical questions to 9708 people aged 18 to 54 years about the past
year's occurrence of suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, and treatment. Trends
were evaluated by using pooled logistic regression analysis. Face-to-face interviews
were administered in the homes of respondents, who were nationally representative
samples of US English-speaking residents.
Main Outcome Measure Self-reports about suicide-related behaviors and treat-
ment in the year before interview.
Results No significant changes occurred between 1990-1992 and 2001-2003 in
suicidal ideation (2.8% vs 3.3%; P=.43), plans (0.7% vs 1.0%; P=.15), gestures
(0.3% vs 0.2%; P=.24), or attempts (0.4%-0.6%; P=.45), whereas conditional
prevalence of plans among ideators increased significantly (from 19.6% to 28.6%;
P=.04), and conditional prevalence of gestures among planners decreased signifi-
cantly (from 21.4% to 6.4%; P=.003). Treatment increased dramatically among ide-
ators who made a gesture (40.3% vs 92.8%) and among ideators who made an
attempt (49.6% vs 79.0%).
Conclusions Despite a dramatic increase in treatment, no significant decrease oc-
curred in suicidal thoughts, plans, gestures, or attempts in the United States during
the 1990s. Continued efforts are needed to increase outreach to untreated individu-
als with suicidal ideation before the occurrence of attempts and to improve treatment
effectiveness for such cases.

individuals in the United States. The
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention maintains a national surveil-
lance system of nonfatal injuries treated
in US hospital emergency depart-
ments,6 as well as a surveillance sys-
tem of health-risk behaviors among
high school students in the United
States.7 These systems provide valu-
able information, but they are limited
because they focus on narrow groups
(attempters who present at hospital
emergency departments and youth who
currently attend high school). Sec-
ond, several epidemiologic surveys have
reported population-based prevalence
estimates for suicidal thoughts and sui-
cide attempts.8-10 It is unclear, though,
whether these results accurately re-
flect current prevalence because of the
considerable increase in recent years in
the number of people in the United
States who have received treatment for
emotional problems.11-13
Substantial efforts have also been
made to develop and implement sui-
cide prevention and intervention pro-
grams during the past decade.14 There
has been a roughly 6% reduction in the
period prevalence of suicide in the
United States among people in the
sample age range (18-54 years) dur-
ing this period, from approximately
14.8 per year per 100 000 population
in 1990-1992 to 13.9 per year per
100 000 population in 2000-2002.5 It
is possible that a significant change also
occurred in the prevalence of suicide-
related behaviors, including suicidal
thoughts, plans, and attempts.

based on the 1990-1992 National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS)15 and the 2001-
2003NationalComorbiditySurveyRep-
lication (NCS-R).16
METHODS
Samples
The NCS is a nationally representative
household survey of English-speaking
residents aged 15 to 54 years.15 The re-
sponse rate was 82.4%, according to the
response rate 3 method of the Ameri-
can Association for Public Opinion Re-
search.17 The latter method includes the
number of completed interviews in the
numerator and the number of origi-
nally sampled households, excluding
ineligible households (ie, vacant house-
holds and households in which the ran-
domly sampled respondent was found
to be ineligible after contact) in the de-
nominator, with an adjustment for the
estimated proportion of uncontacted
households that contained an eligible
respondent. A total of 8098 interviews
were completed. The NCS-R is a na-
tionally representative household sur-
vey of respondents aged 18 years and
older. The response rate was 70.9%,
with the same method of calculation as
in the NCS. A total of 9282 interviews
were completed.
Both surveys used a 2-part internal
subsampling scheme in which all re-
spondents received a part I interview
that assessed mental disorders, whereas
100% of part I respondents who met cri-
teria for a disorder and a probability
subsample of part I respondents who
did not meet criteria for a disorder were
administered the part II interview. The
part II interview assessed risk factors,
treatment, and consequences of men-
tal disorders. Nonrespondent screen-
ing data were used to weight the NCS
for nonresponse bias. Other weights ad-
justed for differential probabilities of se-
lection and residual discrepancies be-
tween sample and census demographic-
geographic distributions. The part II
samples were also weighted for the
oversampling of part I respondents with
disorders. More details about NCS and
NCS-R samples and weights are pre-
sented elsewhere.16,18 Suicidality was as-
sessed in part I of the NCS and in part
II of the NCS-R, whereas most of the
correlates examined here were as-
sessed in part II of both surveys. Data
in the overlapping age range of the 2
surveys (18-54 years) were merged to
analyze the trends reported here by us-
ing part II of the NCS (n=5388) and
part II of the NCS-R (n=4320).
Recruitment and Consent
Introductory letters and study fact bro-
chures were mailed to sample house-
holds to explain the study. Interview-
ers then visited households to answer
remaining questions before obtaining
verbal informed consent and schedul-
ing interviews. Consent was oral rather
than written in the NCS because that
was the standard method of obtaining
consent when the survey was de-
signed in the late 1980s. Oral consent
was used in the NCS-R to maintain
comparability with the NCS for trend
comparison. Respondents received $25
(NCS) or $50 (NCS-R) for participa-
tion. A subsample of nonrespondents
were offered a higher incentive of $50
(NCS) or $100 (NCS-R) to complete a
screening interview. The human sub-
jects committees of the University of
Michigan and of Harvard Medical
School approved these recruitment and
consent procedures.
Suicidal Behaviors
Respondents were asked whether they
ever seriously thought about killing
themselves and, if so, whether they had
these thoughts in the past 12 months.
Respondents who reported such sui-
cidal ideation were then asked whether
they ever made a plan for committing
suicide and, if so, whether they made
such a plan in the past 12 months. Re-
gardless of the answer to the question
about a plan, respondents who re-
portedsuicidalideationwerethenasked
whether they ever attempted suicide
and, if so, whether they made such an
attempt in the past 12 months. Respon-
dents who reported making a 12-
month attempt were then asked to de-
scribe the lethality intent of the attempt
by indicating which of the following 3
statements best described their at-
tempt: "I made a serious attempt to kill
myself and it was only luck that I did
not succeed." "I tried to kill myself, but
knew the method was not foolproof."
"My attempt was a cry for help. I did
not intend to die." Respondents who
endorsed either of the first 2 state-
ments were considered in the analysis
to have made a suicide attempt, whereas

respondents who endorsed the third
statement were considered to have
made a suicide gesture.
Correlates
We examined associations of suicide-
related behaviors with the mental dis-
orders assessed in the 2 surveys. These
disorders were assessed with the World
Health Organization Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),
a fully structured diagnostic interview
designed to be used by trained lay in-
terviewers.19 The Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-
vised Third Edition (DSM-III-R) version
of CIDI was used in the NCS20 and the
DiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMen-
tal Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
version in the NCS-R.21 We also exam-
ined associations of suicide-related be-
haviors with 7 sociodemographic vari-
ables:age,sex,race/ethnicity,education,
marital status, employment status, and
region of the country. Race/ethnicity
was coded into the standard census
codes of non-Hispanic black, non-
Hispanic white, Hispanic, and other ac-
cording to responses to 2 questions
about Hispanic heritage and race. The
following prespecified racial catego-
ries were used in the second question:
American Indian, Alaskan Native,
Asian, black or African American, Na-
tive Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, white,
and other. Race/ethnicity was in-
cluded in the analysis because of ex-
tensive previous research on the rela-
tionship between racial/ethnic minority
status and mental disorder.22 All part
II respondents in both surveys were also
asked about 12-month treatment for
emotional problems. Responses were
used to distinguish treatment across 5
sectors: psychiatrist, other mental
health specialist (eg, psychologist, so-
cial worker in a mental health spe-
cialty setting), general medical practi-
tioner (primary care physician, nurse);
human services professional (reli-
gious or spiritual advisor, social worker
in any setting other than a specialty
mental health setting); and comple-
mentary-alternative medical treat-
ment (CAM; treatment by a CAM pro-
fessional, such as a massage therapist,
or participation in a self-help group).
Analysis Methods
Trends were assessed with pooled lo-
gistic regression equations using the sui-
cidal behaviors as dichotomous out-
comes. Predictors included time (NCS-
R=1, NCS=0), demographics, and
interactions between time and demo-
graphics. Tests for sociodemographic
variation in trends were made at P=.001
(ie, .05/28) as an approximate adjust-
ment for the fact that 28 comparisons
(7sociodemographicpredictorsof4out-
comes) were being made. Standard er-
rors were obtained using the Taylor se-
ries linearization method23 in the
SUDAAN24 software system. Coeffi-
cients were exponentiated to generate
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-
denceintervals(CIs).Significanceofpre-
dictor sets was evaluated with Wald 2
tests using design-adjusted coefficient
variance-covariance matrices.
RESULTS
Trends in Prevalence
No statistically significant differences
were found between the NCS and the
NCS-R in the 12-month prevalence of
any of the 4 outcomes: suicidal ide-
ation (2.8% vs 3.3%, 2
1
=0.6, P=.44),
suicide plans (0.7% vs 1.0%, 2
1
=2.1,
P=.15), suicide gestures (0.3% vs 0.2%,
2
1
=1.4, P=.24), or suicide attempts
(0.4% vs 0.6%, 2
1
= 0.6, P = .44)
(TABLE 1). In subgroup analyses,
though, there was a significant in-
crease in the proportion of ideators who
made a plan (19.6% vs 28.6%, 2
1
=4.4,
P=.04) and a significant decrease in the
proportion of planners who made a ges-
ture (21.4% vs 6.4%, 2
1
=10.0, P=.002).
This latter decrease (but not the former
increase) is large enough to remain sig-
nificant even when we use a P=.005-
level test (ie, .05/9) as an approximate
adjustment because 9 subsample tests
were made to compare the results in
Table 1. In comparison, there were no
significant differences over time in the
proportion of planners who made an at-
tempt (28.1% vs 32.8%, 2
1
=0.4, P=.53),
the proportion of ideators who had no
plan but made a gesture (1.9% vs 3.1%,
2
1
=0.2, P=.75), or the proportion of
ideators who had no plan but made an
attempt (7.3% vs 9.7%, 2
1
=0.1, P=.66).
Prevalence of Mental Disorders

Suicide-Related Behavior
Rigorous comparison of conditional
prevalence estimates of disorders ac-
cording to the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
is impossible across the surveys be-
cause the diagnostic criteria differ

the NCS-R). In both surveys, though,
the majority of ideators (80%-82%)
planners (89%-95%), gesturers (96%-
80%), and attempters (89%-88%) met
criteria for 1 or more of the 12-month
DSM disorders (TABLE 2). Major de-
pression was the most common indi-
vidual disorder among people with sui-
cide-related behaviors in both surveys
(34%-42% in the NCS and 37% to 51%
in the NCS-R), whereas anxiety disor-
ders were the most common class of dis-
orders (63%-78% in the NCS and 52%-
81% in the NCS-R).
Trends in Sociodemographic
Correlates of Prevalence
Trends were examined in the associa-
tions of 7 sociodemographic variables
with each of the 4 outcomes, even
though the overall trends were not sig-
nificant. The rationale was that signifi-
cant changes in subsample trends are
possible even in the presence of no sig-
nificant change at the population level
if an increase in one segment of the
population offsets a decrease in an-
other segment. All but 1 of these 28 tests
failed to exceed the critical value of the
test statistic, whereas inspection of the
data in the one case in which the test
was significant suggested that this re-
sult was due to an outlier. These re-
sults indicate that suicide-related be-
haviors not only remained unchanged
in the population as a whole but also
in major subgroups of the population
defined by sociodemographic variables.
According to the above result, we
were able to pool the data in the 2
samples to examine consistent socio-
demographic correlates of suicide-
related behaviors. A global test showed
that the sociodemographics were sig-
nificant overall in predicting all 4 out-
comes (2
18
=100.5-594.1, P.001), al-
though the associations were fairly
modest in substantive terms (contin-
gency coefficients, 0.10-0.26)
(TABLE 3). A consistent inverse asso-
ciation existed between age and all the
outcomes, with the highest ORs in the
youngest age group (15-24 years;
OR=2.6-9.8) and the lowest in the old-
est age group (45-54 years; with ORs
fixed at 1.0). This association was sig-
nificant in all 4 outcomes. Respon-
dents with less than college education
had consistently elevated ORs com-
pared with college graduates (1.8-

50.6), although overall education dif-
ferences were significant in only 2 of
the 4 outcomes. Previously married re-
spondents had elevated ORs com-
pared with the married respondents
(1.5-4.4) significant in 3 outcomes. Un-
employed or disabled respondents had
generally elevated ORs compared with
the employed respondents (3.8-4.3) sig-
nificant in 3 outcomes. Somewhat
weaker ORs were found for being fe-
male (1.0-2.9, significant for 1 out-
come) and for being a homemaker (1.2-
2.9, significant in only 1 outcome). The
never married had elevated ORs for ges-
tures (3.9 and significant) but de-
creased ORs for ideation, plans, and at-
tempts (0.4-0.8, significant only for
attempts). Race/ethnicity and region of
the country were not significantly re-
lated to any of the outcomes.
Trends in Treatment
Respondents who reported 12-month
suicidal ideation were divided into 3
mutually exclusive subgroups defined
by the presence of an attempt, a ges-
ture, or neither. Respondents in each
of these 3 subgroups were then distin-
guished by whether or not they had a
suicide plan, thus creating 6 sub-
groups. The proportion of respon-
dents who reported receiving treat-
ment for emotional problems in the past
12 months increased over time in each
of these 6 subgroups, 2 of them signifi-
cantly so at the .05 level (TABLE 4). The
increases were confined to treatment in
the psychiatrist sector and the general
medical sector. No significant in-
creases were found in the other men-
tal health, human services, or CAM sec-
tors (results available on request).
Although treatment in the mental
health specialty sectors (either psychia-
trist or other mental health specialist)
remained somewhat more common
than treatment in the general medical
sector in 5 of the 6 NCS-R subgroups,
this difference was much more pro-
nounced in the NCS than the NCS-R
because of a greater increase in gen-
eral medical than mental health spe-
cialty treatment in all subgroups. Even
with these increases, sizable minori-
ties with evidence of suicide-related be-
haviors (21.0% of attempters, 7.2% of
respondents who made a gesture, and
35.6% of ideators who made neither a
gesture nor an attempt) received no
treatment for emotional problems in the
past 12 months in the NCS-R.

prevalence of gestures among ide-
ators, we stratified respondents with
suicidal ideation by treatment and es-
timated the conditional prevalence of
gestures and attempts. The prevalence
of gestures was found not to decrease
between the 2 surveys more among re-
spondents who received treatment than
among those who did not (TABLE 5).
Furthermore, the prevalence of at-
tempts was found not to increase be-
tween the surveys more among respon-
dents who did not receive treatment
than among those who did.
COMMENT
These results should be interpreted with
5 limitations in mind. First, the out-
comes are sufficiently rare that mean-
ingful changes could have occurred that
were not detected as statistically sig-
nificant with samples of the size con-
sidered here. Also, a number of the ORs
in the prediction equation have wide
CIs. Second, suicide-related behaviors
are likely to be underreported because
of stigmas that might change and vary
at a point in time across sociodemo-
graphic segments of society. Third, al-
though the survey methods were kept
as comparable as possible in the 2 sur-
veys, even subtle differences in inter-
view procedures, sample nonre-
sponse, or respondent reluctance to
admit suicidal thoughts or behaviors
could have led to changes in the inter-
nal validity of responses over time.
Fourth, external validity is reduced by
the fact that the response rate was less
than perfect, coupled with the fact that
the sampling frame excluded people
older than 54 years, individuals living
in institutions, the homeless, and in-
dividuals who had completed suicide.
Fifth, we did not assess whether treat-
ments began before or after onset of sui-
cidality, nor did we assess the ad-
equacy or effectiveness of treatment,
which might have changed over time.
With these limitations in mind, the
analysis documented 3 noteworthy re-
sults. First, we found no significant
changes in the 12-month prevalence of
suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, or at-
tempts, which is consistent with an ear-
lier analysis that found no evidence of
change in the overall 12-month preva-
lence of DSM-IV mental disorders in the
2 surveys.25 The lack of trends in sui-
cide-related behaviors does not follow
logically from the failure to find a trend
in disorder prevalence for 2 reasons: a
meaningful minority of respondents
with suicide-related behaviors did not
meet 12-month criteria for any of the
DSM disorders assessed in the 2 sur-
veys (eg, 18%-20% of ideators and 11%-
12% of attempters), and the remain-
ing respondents with suicidal behaviors
had a much higher concentration of se-
vere and comorbid 12-month DSM dis-

*Any mental health treatment includes treatment by a psychiatrist, as well as by a nonphysician mental health specialist (eg, psychologist, social worker in a mental health specialty
setting). General medical treatment includes treatment by any nonpsychiatrist physician or a worker in a general medical setting (eg, nurse in a primary care setting). In addition
to including mental health and general medical treatment, the category of any treatment includes treatment by a human services professional (eg, religious or spiritual advisor,
social worker) and complementary-alternative medical treatment (treatment by a professional, such as a massage therapist, or participation in a self-help group).

orders than cases in the general popu-
lation.
Second, we found that risk of suicide-
related behaviors is consistently el-
evated in several vulnerable sub-
groups, including the young, women,
individuals with low education, and in-
dividuals lacking stable relationships or
employment. These patterns did not
change significantly, which means that
the lack of a significant time trend in
the prevalence of suicide-related be-
haviors in the total sample does not
mask opposite-direction significant
trends in major sociodemographic seg-
ments of the population. It also means
that the enormous increase in treat-
ment of emotional problems in the de-
cade between the 2 surveys did not re-
duce the disparities in risk of suicide-
related behaviors associated with these
disadvantaged social statuses.
Third, we found that treatment in-
creasedsubstantiallyamongpeoplewith
suicide-related behaviors, which is con-
sistent with a number of earlier studies
that documented increased treatment of
mental health problems throughout the
decade,11-13 presumably linked to the in-
troduction of direct-to-consumer mar-
keting of new psychotropic drugs; new
communityprogramstopromoteaware-
ness, screening, and help-seeking for
mental disorders; expansion of "carve-
out"systemstodelivermentalhealthser-
vices; and new policies to reduce barri-
ers to service use.26-34
It is not clear how to interpret the
finding that suicide-related behaviors
did not decrease when treatment in-
creased dramatically. Completed sui-
cides decreased by about 6% during this
period. The increase in treatment might
have played a part in this trend, al-
though county-level analysis shows no
overall association between amount of
treatment, as indicated by per-capita
number of antidepressant prescrip-
tions, and the suicide rate.35 If in-
creased treatment did play a part in the
decrease in the suicide rate, then why
did we not see a comparable decrease
in suicide-related behaviors?
One way to begin addressing this
question is to recognize that suicide-
related behaviors are distinct from com-
pleted suicides, if for no other reason
than their numbers. There are approxi-
mately 3000 suicide ideators per
100 000 population and 500 suicide at-
tempters per 100 000 population in the
United States each year compared with
only 14 suicide completers per 100 000
population. It is possible that pro-
cesses affecting the comparatively small
number of suicide completers had no
effect on the much larger number of ide-
ators or attempters.
We cannot rule out the possibility
that methodologic factors played a role
in suicide-related behaviors not being
less prevalent in the NCS-R than the
NCS. Such factors could include dif-
ferences between the surveys either in
sample bias or in willingness to admit
suicide-related behaviors to interview-
ers. Arguing against these possibilities
are our adjusting for sample selection
bias with nonresponse adjustment
weights and our finding no evidence in
responses to questions about stigma
that willingness to admit emotional
problems increased over time.
In light of these results, 3 substan-
tive possibilities appear to be more plau-
sible than methodologic ones in ac-
counting for the finding that suicide-
related behaviors remained unchanged
in the NCS and NCS-R when treat-
ment increased dramatically. One is that
the prevalence of suicide-related be-
haviors would have increased, were it
not for the increase in treatment. A sec-
ond is that attempters typically ob-
tained treatment only after making at-
tempts. A third is that the increase in
treatment was of such low intensity or
quality that it had no effect on suicide-
related behaviors.
Although all 3 substantive interpre-
tations are equally consistent with the
survey data, other information argues
against the possibility that the in-
crease in treatment prevented an in-
crease that would otherwise have oc-
curred in suicide-related behaviors.
Specifically, randomized controlled
trials find only modest effects of treat-
ment in reducing suicidality, even with
optimal regimens.36-40 Community stud-
ies of treatment quality consistently find
that the majority of patients currently
in treatment for mental disorders re-
ceive care that fails to meet minimal evi-
dence-based guidelines.41-44 An added
complication raised by the US Food and
Drug Administration's recent analyses
of pediatric antidepressant trials is that
the benefit from treatment in terms of
symptom improvement in some pa-
tients might be offset by adverse ef-
fects of medications in other pa-
tients.45 Taken together, these results
would lead us not to expect substan-
tial effects of increased treatment on
population trends in suicidality.
It is more difficult to determine the
relative importance of the other 2 pos-
sibilities: that increased treatment either
did not reach suicidal people quickly
enough to prevent attempts or that this
treatment, when it was delivered in
time, was of such low intensity or qual-
ity that it was ineffective in preventing
attempts. Both processes could have
been at work, which suggests several
important directions for future inves-
tigation. With regard to the timeliness
of treatment, we know that a substan-
tial minority of survey respondents with
suicide-related behaviors received no
treatment. In addition, we suspect that
at least some who reported receiving
treatment did so only after making a sui-
cide gesture or attempt. These results
mean that efforts are needed to in-
crease access to and demand for treat-
ment among people with suicidal ide-
ation. The most serious cases--
ideators who make attempts--
experienced smaller increases in
treatment throughout the decade than
less serious cases. Programs that ex-
pand treatment resources32,46 may be es-
pecially important in addressing this
problem, as might initiatives that en-
courage timely treatment seeking spe-
cifically among people with suicidal ide-
ation (eg, Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration's Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Lifeline pro-
gram).47 Because the dramatic in-
crease in treatment in the last decade
failed to reduce sociodemographic dis-
parities in the suicidal behaviors con-

sidered here, programs specifically tar-
getinghigh-riskpopulationsareneeded.
Recent policies and National Institute
of Mental Health initiatives encourag-
ing treatment among traditionally un-
derserved and high-risk groups may
provide useful models.48-50
Increased treatment, though, will be
of little value unless the quality of treat-
ment is adequate. Efforts are needed to
identify optimal interventions for pri-
mary and secondary prevention of sui-
cidality. Although a growing litera-
ture has shed light on the optimal
intensity, duration, and follow-up re-
quired to treat mental disorders,51-56
comparable data on optimal treat-
ments of suicidal thoughts and behav-
iors are just beginning to emerge.57 A
recognition is needed that effective pre-
vention of suicide attempts might re-
quire substantially more intensive treat-
ment than is currently provided to the
majority of people in outpatient treat-
ment for mental disorders. In light of
the controversy about the role of anti-
depressants in suicidality among ado-
lescents, identifying whether emerg-
ing treatments have the potential to
ameliorate suicidality in some individu-
als while potentially worsening it in oth-
ers will be important. The solution is
likely to involve providing intensive
monitoring and follow-up, as indi-
cated in the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration's recent "black box" warning
for all antidepressants.58
Efforts will also be needed to pro-
mote the uptake of effective treat-
ments for suicidality, including those
that already exist, as well as any new
treatments that are developed and
shown to be effective. Substantial bar-
riers to uptake of effective interven-
tions continue to exist, including com-
peting clinical demands and distorted
incentives for treating mental disor-
ders and symptoms.31,59-61 Failure to dis-
seminate evidence-based treatments
widely may, in fact, help explain why
suicidality did not decline in response
to the treatment increases during the
1990s. This means that expansion of
disease management programs, treat-
ment quality-assurance programs, and
"report cards" to improve the quality
of care for suicidal patients may all be
needed to reduce the burden of suicid-
ality.62-66
