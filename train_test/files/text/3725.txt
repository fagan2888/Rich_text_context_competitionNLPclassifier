Introduction
Large, prospective, multicenter clinical trials are
the standard by which the efficacy and safety of a
medication are determined in order to obtain reg-
ulatory approval. However, due to strict inclusion
and exclusion criteria, study populations investi-
gated in pivotal clinical trials are not necessarily
representative of the heterogeneous patient popu-
lation seen by healthcare providers in clinical
practice. Therefore, assessments of real-world
medication use and treatment outcomes in clini-
cal practice are important.
Alosetron is a selective 5-HT3
-receptor antago-
nist approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
women with irritable bowel syndrome with
Alosetron use in clinical practice: significant
improvement in irritable bowel syndrome
symptoms evaluated using the US Food and
Drug Administration composite endpoint

Abstract
Background: Alosetron is approved to treat women with severe IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D) who
have failed standard therapy. In our study, we aimed to evaluate alosetron efficacy using new
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endpoints and utilization in clinical practice.
Methods: This prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational 12-week study evaluated
women with severe IBS-D enrolled in the alosetron prescribing program. The coprimary FDA
endpoints were changes from baseline in stool consistency and abdominal pain severity.
Responders achieved a 30% decrease compared with baseline in weekly average of the
worst abdominal pain in the past 24 h, and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the
number of days/week with at least one stool of type 6 (mushy) or type 7 (watery) consistency.
Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in stool frequency, fecal urgency and
fecal incontinence.
Results: Enrolled patients (n = 192) were primarily White (90.6%), with a mean age of 44.5
years. Patient and physician rating of IBS severity was between moderate and severe (85.9%
concordance, Spearman coefficient 0.429, p < 0.0001). Alosetron 0.5 mg twice daily (82.8%)
was the most common dosing regimen. A total of 152 alosetron-treated patients completed
the study. Of 105 fully evaluable patients, 45% met the FDA composite endpoint responder
criteria for 50% of the study period. Improvements in all individual symptoms were
statistically significant compared with baseline. There were no serious adverse events, cases
of colonic ischemia, or complications of constipation.
Conclusion: In a clinical practice setting study, alosetron demonstrated treatment success
using a rigorous FDA composite endpoint and also improved multiple other IBS symptoms,
including fecal urgency and incontinence in women with severe IBS-D [ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01257477].

diarrhea (IBS-D) who have failed conventional
therapy.1 Initially approved in 2000, it was volun-
tarily removed from the market due to concerns
over side effects of constipation and rare events of
colonic ischemia.2 The FDA reapproved alose-
tron in 2002 for the treatment of women with
severe IBS-D who had failed to respond to con-
ventional treatment. Two generic formulations of
alosetron have recently been approved by the
FDA using the same 2002 indication and recom-
mended dosage range.
Interestingly, despite documented efficacy in
clinical trials,3 no prospective studies have been
performed in clinical practice settings to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of alosetron in women
diagnosed with severe IBS-D using Rome III cri-
teria. As well, no studies have evaluated the effi-
cacy of alosetron using the new FDA composite
endpoint which requires improvement in both
abdominal pain and diarrhea.4
The objectives were to: (a) evaluate alosetron effi-
cacy using the new FDA composite endpoint in
women with IBS-D who meet Rome III criteria;
(b) evaluate changes in fecal urgency and inconti-
nence during alosetron therapy; (c) measure the
clinical utilization pattern of alosetron in real-
world clinical-practice settings with respect to
patient characteristics, (d) evaluate the dosing
regimen prescribed in medical practice (including
subsequent adjustments); (e) assess concordance
between physician and patient assessments of
change in IBS-D symptoms during alosetron
treatment, and (f) evaluate drug safety.
Methods
This prospective, open-label, multicenter obser-
vationalstudy(Protocol10LOT01)[ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT01257477] evaluated alose-
tron use in clinical practice of healthcare providers
in the United States enrolled in the Prescribing
Program for Lotronex (PPL) in women with
severe IBS-D from November 2010 to March
2013.5 Sample size for the study was determined
by the number of consenting eligible patients
entered during the prespecified 28 months enroll-
ment period. Per PPL guidelines, the recom-
mended starting alosetron dose is 0.5 mg twice
daily (b.i.d.) and can be increased to 1 mg b.i.d.
after 4 weeks if the starting dose is well tolerated
but does not adequately control IBS symptoms.
Alosetron should be discontinued in patients who
have not had adequate control of IBS symptoms
after 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg b.i.d.
Additional dose adjustments were permitted.
A total of 67 investigative sites participated in
the study; 31 were gastrointestinal (GI) clinical
practice groups, 4 sites were GI academic prac-
tices and 32 were primary care sites. Institutional
review boards approved the protocol and patients
provided written informed consent. Adult
females aged 18­65 years diagnosed with IBS-D
(according to the Rome III criteria6) with IBS
symptoms for at least 6 months not adequately
controlled by other IBS therapy were enrolled if
they met the definition of severe IBS-D by hav-
ing one or more of the following criteria, as
defined in the package insert: frequent and
severe abdominal pain/discomfort; frequent
bowel urgency or fecal incontinence; or disabil-
ity or restriction of daily activities due to IBS.1
Three to four patients were entered per investi-
gative site. Exclusion criteria included presence
of biochemical or structural abnormalities of the
digestive tract, concomitant unstable medical
condition(s), history of bloody diarrhea or
abdominal pain with rectal bleeding, known or
suspected bile acid malabsorption, chronic or
severe constipation or complications from con-
stipation, recurrent bowel obstruction, throm-
bophlebitis or a hypercoagulable state. Patients
who were currently constipated or who had no
bowel movements for three or more days during
the 2-week screening period were excluded.
Data collection
Patients recorded daily diary entries describing
bowel habits and IBS pain for 7­14 days during
screening. Eligible patients received an alosetron
prescription from their healthcare providers and
obtained alosetron from a pharmacy. At a base-
line visit, patients and healthcare providers com-
pleted questionnaires on their perceptions of
disease severity, most bothersome symptoms,
and satisfaction/success with the prestudy treat-
ment for IBS-D. Patients initiated alosetron
treatment after the baseline study visit and com-
pleted daily diaries on bowel habit and IBS pain
for all 12 weeks of the study. Study visits
occurred at 4 and 12 weeks. At the week 12
(exit) visit, patients and healthcare providers
again completed symptom and treatment satis-
faction questionnaires for comparison with those
obtained at baseline.

Study endpoints
This study evaluated the composite primary end-
points (abdominal pain intensity and stool consist-
ency) currently recommended by FDA for studies of
drugs to treat IBS-D. In addition, as an exploratory
endpoint, it also evaluated for overall treatment
responder status, as specified in the 2012 `Guidance
for Industry' publication.4 The clinical measure-
ments used to assess for improvement in both
abdominal pain intensity and in stool consistency
were recorded daily in a diary by the patient during
baseline and throughout alosetron treatment. The
intensity of the worst abdominal pain occurring in
the past 24 h was rated by the patient using a
10-point scale (where 0 = `no pain' and 10 = `worst
possible pain'). Stool consistency was evaluated for
each bowel movement by having the patient visually
compare each expelled stool with a standardized
scale Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) which pre-
sented photographs of seven stool types that varied
in consistency from hard balls of stool (type 1) to
mushy (type 6) or only liquid stool (type 7). A daily
average stool consistency score was calculated if
more than one stool was passed each day. Average
weekly values for daily abdominal pain intensity
scores and for stool consistency scores were calcu-
lated and used to evaluate for weekly treatment
responder status for these two parameters. A
responder for abdominal pain intensity was defined
as a patient who experienced a decrease of at least
30% in the weekly average abdominal pain intensity
score as compared with baseline. A stool consistency
responder was defined as a patient who experienced
a 50% or greater reduction in the number of days
per week with at least one stool that had a consist-
ency of type 6 or type 7 compared with baseline.
An overall responder to alosetron treatment was
defined as a patient who achieved the prespecified
improvement in the weekly scores for both
abdominal pain intensity and stool consistency
for at least 50% of the study weeks, that is, in at
least 6 of 12 weeks.
Secondary endpoints included changes from base-
line in stool frequency, and proportion of days
with fecal urgency and fecal incontinence. Baseline
and on-treatment percentage of days with fecal
urgency and incontinence were calculated as the
total number of reporting days divided by the
number of days the patient reported the event,
multiplied by 100. The percentage of fecal
urgency-free days during alosetron treatment was
also calculated for patients who recorded fecal
urgency as being present during baseline. The
treatment response metric of fecal urgency-free
days has been suggested as a useful way to assess
treatment response in patients with IBS-D.7
Data on the type and number of other IBS thera-
pies used at baseline and during alosetron treat-
ment were collected. The proportion of patients
who increased (to 1 mg b.i.d.) or decreased (to
0.5 mg once daily) their dose from the starting dos-
age regimen of 0.5 mg b.i.d. was analyzed. Dose
titrations were based on the investigators' expertise,
with the goal of controlling IBS symptoms.
Patients and physicians rated IBS severity on a
scale of 1 (not very severe) to 7 (extremely severe)
and identified the symptoms that improved after
alosetron treatment. The percentage level of con-
cordance in treatment outcome and improvement
in IBS symptoms was compared between patients
and their treating physicians. Success and satis-
faction with conventional therapy at baseline, or
alosetron therapy at week 12 was rated on a scale
where 1 = not successful or not satisfied and 7 =
extremely successful or extremely satisfied.
Safety
All patients who received at least one alosetron
dose were evaluated for safety throughout treat-
ment and during follow up. Physical exams, blood
counts and serum chemistries were performed at
the 4- and 12-week/final visits. Adverse events of
ischemic colitis, ischemic changes, ischemia or
necrosis of the colon, constipation requiring hospi-
talization or an emergency room visit, and possible
complications of constipation (e.g. obstruction,
perforation, intestinal ulceration, toxic megacolon,
ileus, or impaction) resulting in hospitalization or
emergency room visit were reported within 24 h of
discovery by study investigators, regardless of seri-
ousness or severity. Physician impression of alose-
tron tolerability was rated on a 7-point scale where
1 = not well tolerated and 7 = very well tolerated.
Statistical analysis
SAS (Version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US)
was used for data analyses.
Baseline average stool consistency score and pain
severity scores were calculated for the screening
period and weekly during alosetron treatment.
Week 4 and 12/study termination results and
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11

changes from baseline were tested by nonpara-
metric Wilcoxon rank-sum test,8 and summarized
descriptively.
Concordance between patient and physician assess-
ments of overall success of treatment outcome, as
well as improvement in individual symptoms from
baseline to the week 12 evaluation was also under-
taken. Evidence for concordance (lack of signifi-
cant difference) in the patient versus physician
assessment was assessed using McNemar's test.
Results
Study population and baseline characteristics
A total of 256 patients were screened and 192
(75%) enrolled (Figure 1). Reasons for screen
failure (n = 64; 25%) included: screening criteria
not being met (17.2%), consent withheld or with-
drawn (31.3%), or the patient was unable to pay
the cost of the study medication (21.9%). Other
reasons for screen failure and disposition of the
randomized patients are shown in Figure 1. A
total of 192 patients were started on study medi-
cation (see Figure 1). Forty of these patients dis-
continued the study medication. The main
reasons for discontinuation were inadequate relief
of symptoms (n = 11), adverse events (n = 10; 7
with worsening abdominal pain; 2 with increased
constipation, and 1 with worsening diarrhea) or
lost to follow up (n = 6). A sum of 152 patients
completed the study. Fully evaluable data sets
were incomplete in 47 of these patients, due to
the provider not completing all forms or the
patient not answering all questions on the ques-
tionnaires at each visit. Thus, the fully evaluable
(per protocol) patient population consisted of
105 patients for whom all study visits and proce-
dures per protocol were completed.
Patient characteristics and baseline IBS symp-
toms are shown in Table 1. Most patients
were White (90.6%); the mean age was 44.5
years. Patients' mean abdominal pain score
was 4.2, while stool consistency was loose, with
a mean BSFS of 5.2. Fecal urgency occurred
on >75% of baseline days and fecal inconti-
nence occurred on approximately 18% of these
days (see Table 2).
Results of patient and healthcare provider
assessments of overall IBS severity at baseline
are shown in Table 1. Both groups assessed IBS
severity as between moderately severe and
severe, with an 85.9% concordance (Spearman
coefficient 0.429, p < 0.0001). The percentage
of patients meeting each of the criteria for severe
IBS-D, as specified in current alosetron labe-
ling, was 92% for frequent and severe abdomi-
nal pain and discomfort; 98% for frequent bowel
urgency or fecal incontinence; and 88% for dis-
ability or restrictions of daily activities due to
IBS. The majority of patients (84.4%) met all
three severity criteria, while 15.6% met two of
three criteria.
Alosetron dosing and dosing adjustments.Baseline
alosetron dosing regimens and adjustments during
the study were determined from the physicians'
prescribing information.The most common start-
ing alosetron regimen was 0.5 mg b.i.d. (159/192,
82.8%) followed by 0.5 mg once daily (22/192,
Figure 1. Progression of patients in the study.

11.5%), 1 mg b.i.d. (4/192, 2.1%), and other doses
(7/192, 3.6%).The 0.5 mg b.i.d. regimen was also
the most common at 4 and 12 weeks (55.6% and
54.6% of patients, respectively). During the study
period, 54% of patients remained on the baseline
dose without any changes, while 16% had their
dose titrated upwards, and 22% had their dose
titrated downwards. A total of 25% patients had
multiple dose adjustments.
Efficacy analyses
Composite endpoint of irritable bowel syndrome
pain and stool consistency.The FDA composite
endpoint was determined from patient-reported
changes in both IBS pain and in stool consistency.
The proportion of both enrolled (intent-to-treat
population) and evaluable patients meeting
responder criteria for the composite endpoint dur-
ing each of the 12 weeks of the study is shown in
Figure 2(a) and was similar in each population. By
week 3, 43% of evaluable patients met the criteria
and this response was largely sustained for the rest
of the 12-week study. A total of 45% of evaluable
patients were considered to be overall responders,
since they met the FDA composite endpoint crite-
ria for 50% of the 12-week study period.

urgency at baseline, and who were urgency free
at each study week, is shown in Figure 2(b).
Only five patients (4.7%) of the evaluable popu-
lation (n = 105) reported no fecal urgency dur-
ing baseline. By 4 weeks of alosetron treatment,
26% of those who had baseline fecal urgency (n
= 100) reported being urgency free (p <
0.0001). During week 8, the number of patients
free of fecal urgency had increased to almost
31% (p < .0001) and by the end of the study,
39.6% of patients did not report urgency (p <
0.0001). Responders were those patients who
became completely free of fecal urgency for at
least 50% or at least 75% of days during study
treatment. The 50% responder value was 69%
[95% confidence interval (CI) = 59.0, 77.9]
and the 75% responder value was 47% (95%
CI = 36.9, 57.2).
Individual bowel symptoms.Improvements in
individual IBS-D bowel symptoms during base-
line and alosetron treatment, as well as the calcu-
lated change from baseline at weeks 4 and 12, are
shown as mean values [±standard error of the
mean (SE)] in Table 2. All changes from baseline
at 4 and 12 weeks were statistically significant. A
total of 44% (45/105) and 65% (64/105) of eval-
uable patients achieved at least a 30% decrease in
abdominal pain at weeks 4 and 12, respectively.
Stool consistency improved by at least one point
for 55% (55/105) of patients at week 4 and 64%
(65/105) at week 12 (p < 0.001).The number of
stools/day, the percentage of days with urgency,
and percentage of days with fecal incontinence
were also significantly reduced from baseline at
weeks 4 and 12.The percentage of days with fecal
incontinence and fecal urgency by study week are
shown in Figure 3. Alosetron significantly
reduced fecal incontinence (p = 0.005 at week 3;
p < 0.0001 for weeks 4­5 and 7­10; <0.003 for
week 11; and p < 0.0005 for week 12). Fecal
urgency improved at all specified evaluation
points during the 12-week study (please see
below, p < 0.0001).
Patient and physician assessments of improvement
insymptoms andoveralltreatmentsuccess.Patient
and healthcare provider perceptions of alosetron's
impact on individual IBS symptoms after 12 weeks
for the evaluable population (n = 105) correlated
well. More than two thirds of patients reported
improvements in abdominal pain/discomfort,
urgency, diarrhea, and interference of IBS-D
symptoms with daily activities. Similarly, health-
care providers documented improvements in the
same symptoms for two thirds or more of the
patients.With the exception of control of urgency
(p = 0.03), assessments for symptom improve-
ment were not statistically different between the
patients and their physicians. Improvement in

symptoms of bloating was somewhat less than for
the other symptoms noted above, being reported
by 35% of patients and more than 40% of physi-
cians (difference not statistically significant).
Assessments of overall treatment success with
alosetron made independently by the patients and
their healthcare providers demonstrated means of

physician assessment of alosetron success was
90.5% (Spearman coefficient 0.758, p < 0.001).
Concomitant irritable bowel syndrome medica-
tions.
IBS-related medications were used by
51/192 patients (26.6%) during the 30 days prior
to enrollment in the study and had to be taken at
a stable dose to be eligible for the study. Patient
satisfaction with medications used during base-
line to treat IBS symptoms was 2.4 ± 0.12 (out of
seven points maximum). During baseline (7­14
days), the only `IBS medication' used by more
than 5% of patients was loperamide hydrochlo-
ride (n = 13, 6.8%). During the 12-week study,
96 patients (50%) used IBS-related concomitant
medications. The most frequent concomitant
medications were loperamide hydrochloride,
diphenoxylate-atropine and hyoscyamine sulfate
which were used by 29 (15.1%), 17 (8.9%) and
14 (7.3%) of patients, respectively. The mean
number of IBS-related medications used during
the study (0.7 ± 1.0) was similar to the mean
number used at baseline (0.8 ± 1.1).
Safety and tolerability
Healthcare provider impression of tolerability was
6.2 ± 0.10 (out of seven points) for the evaluable
population. Treatment-emergent adverse events
(TEAEs) occurred in 44.3% of enrolled patients
(85/192) and 22.9% (44/192) had a drug-related
adverse event. The most common TEAE (>5
patients) are shown in Table 3, and included con-
stipation (23/192, 12%), abdominal pain (18/192,
9.4%), and nausea (9/192, 4.7%). There were no
serious adverse events. More specifically, there
were no cases of colonic ischemia, no reports of
complications of constipation, and no deaths dur-
ing the study. Thirteen patients (6.8%) stopped
treatment due to one or more adverse events.
Discussion
This study enrolled women with severe IBS-D, as
defined by the current product label for alosetron.
All patients were derived from the clinical prac-
tices of healthcare providers enrolled in the PPL.
Although patients needed to meet only one crite-
rion in the label to initiate alosetron, the vast
majority of patients in the study (84%) met all
three symptom-severity criteria, and both patients
and healthcare providers concurred on the overall
IBS severity at baseline. Thus, patients in this
study are typical of those currently treated in `real
world' clinical practice.
Alosetron has been previously studied in a large
number of single- and repeat-dose studies.3,9 This
prospective observational trial is unique in that it is
the first alosetron study to enroll patients using the
Rome III criteria. In addition, it is the only prospec-
tive study of alosetron in which treatment efficacy
was evaluated by the new FDA composite end-
point,4 the current benchmark for demonstrating

requirement, was 44.6%, demonstrating alosetron's
high level of control of abdominal pain and diarrhea,
the two cardinal symptoms of IBS-D evaluated by
the FDA composite endpoint. Importantly, one of
the most bothersome symptoms of IBS-D, fecal
urgency, also significantly improved during this
study. Calculation of responder status for freedom
from fecal urgency during treatment showed that the
50% and 75% responder rates during alosetron
treatment were 69% and 47%, respectively. These
responder rates during alosetron treatment compare
favorably with those observed during eluxadoline
(100 mg b.i.d. dose) treatment (41% and 23%,
respectively),10 a mixed -opioid receptor agonist/-
opioid receptor antagonist approved by the FDA in
2015 for IBS-D. Evaluation of responder status for
complete relief of fecal urgency during treatment
with rifaximin, another drug approved by FDA for
IBS-D treatment in 2015, has not been fully
reported. A review of alosetron, eluxadoline, and
rifaximin efficacy and safety demonstrated that alos-
etron had the greatest numerical treatment response
using the FDA composite endpoint.11
Alosetron efficacy was consistent with that reported
in previous clinical trials that used higher initial
starting doses of alosetron.12­16 Importantly, this
prospective study is the only trial which evaluated
IBS-D patients with the currently recommended
starting dose of 0.5 mg of alosetron b.i.d. with
clinical monitoring to assess the need for dosing
changes as indicated by treatment response. A pre-
vious randomized, controlled study in women with
severe IBS-D (Rome II criteria) demonstrated that
alosetron doses of 0.5 mg once daily, 1 mg once
daily, and 1 mg b.i.d. were all effective in providing
global improvement in IBS symptoms, adequate
relief of IBS pain and discomfort, and improve-
ment in bowel symptoms.17 The lower starting
doses also resulted in statistically significant and
clinically relevant improvements in health-related
quality of life, restriction of daily activities, and
treatment satisfaction compared with placebo.18
However, there was no opportunity to change the
dose if treatment response was inadequate. In our
real-world clinical-practice management study, no
dosing adjustments were required for the majority
of patients whose treatment was initiated at the
recommended starting dose of 0.5 mg b.i.d., indi-
cating that IBS symptoms are well controlled in
the majority of patients at the recommended lower
alosetron starting dose.
There was excellent agreement between patient
and healthcare provider perceptions of IBS sever-
ity at baseline and symptom improvement during
alosetron treatment. This concordance is improved
over that reported in previous studies comparing
patient and healthcare provider perceptions of IBS
symptoms and severity19 and may reflect the suc-
cess of the alosetron risk management program in
selecting appropriate patients for treatment, as well

as the greater understanding of severe IBS-D
among physicians enrolled in the PPL.
Alosetron was well tolerated during the current
study and there were no cases of ischemic colitis
or complications of constipation. These results
reinforce the recommended dosing regimen and
support the conclusion that the PPL successfully
mitigates the occurrence of alosetron-related
severe adverse events.20,21
Limitations of the study include that it was non-
blinded and no control group was used. Cost of
the medication also limited approximately 6% of
patients from participating, which is common in
medical practice. Had the currently lower-priced
generic version of alosetron been available at the
time of the study, it might have allowed more
patients to participate. Similar to nearly all IBS
studies, the enrolled population was predomi-
nantly White. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of
data regarding alosetron treatment outcomes in
other races or ethnic groups. Although no cases of
ischemic colitis occurred during this study, the
sample size was not adequately powered to iden-
tify this, given that the risk of ischemic colitis in
alosetron users is calculated at approximately 1 in
1000 users.20,21 Finally, this study allowed
patients to continue to use other available medi-
cations taken during baseline for IBS-D symp-
toms, as long as the dose remained stable.
However, this does not diminish the positive find-
ings reported in the study, since patients entered
the study only because they were symptomatic
despite current treatment.
Conclusion
In this real-world clinical-practice assessment of
alosetron use in women with severe IBS-D who
met current labeling prescribing requirements,
dosing with alosetron was consistent with labeling
guidelines and there were minimal dose adjust-
ments during the 3 months of treatment.
Alosetron significantly improved multiple IBS
symptoms, including IBS pain and stool consist-
ency using the FDA composite endpoint, fecal
urgency, and incontinence. Patients and health-
care providers had similar assessments of the
improvement in multiple IBS symptoms during
alosetron treatment. Alosetron was well tolerated
and there were no reports of colonic ischemia or
complications of constipation during the 3
months of observation. Overall, these results
support use of alosetron as a clinically effective
treatment for severe IBS-D in women who have
not responded adequately to other treatments.
