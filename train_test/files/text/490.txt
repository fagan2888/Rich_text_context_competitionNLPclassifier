Recent research suggests that the genotype of one individual in a
friendship pair is predictive of the genotype of his/her friend.
These results provide tentative support for the genetic homophily
perspective, which has important implications for social and genetic
epidemiology because it substantiates a particular form of gene­
environment correlation. This process may also have important
implications for social scientists who study the social factors re-
lated to health and health-related behaviors. We extend this work
by considering the ways in which school context shapes geneti-
cally similar friendships. Using the network, school, and genetic
information from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, we show that genetic homophily for the TaqI A polymor-
phism within the DRD2 gene is stronger in schools with greater
levels of inequality. Our results suggest that individuals with sim-
ilar genotypes may not actively select into friendships; rather, they
may be placed into these contexts by institutional mechanisms
outside of their control. Our work highlights the fundamental role
played by broad social structures in the extent to which genetic
factors explain complex behaviors, such as friendships.
There is very little question in the social and medical sciences
that "birds of a feather" are far more likely to "flock together"
compared with differently feathered birds (1). The likelihood of
phenotypically similar individuals having social ties has been ob-
served for race, age, education, religion, personality, political views,
and health outcomes and behaviors (1, 2). Social connections
among persons with similar characteristics are important because
these connections may be linked to the reproduction of current
social contexts including concentrated socioeconomic disadvan-
tage or the maintenance of health-related social norms (3, 4).
To date, the bulk of the research on dyadic ties (connections
between two people) has stressed the selective and influential
roles of social and behavioral factors (5). New evidence suggests
that the genotype of one individual is predictive of the genotype
of his/her friends (6). The "genetic similarity theory" (7­9) hy-
pothesizes that people maximize their inclusive fitness not only
by their mate selection but also by making friends with and
helping their most genetically proximate neighbors. As such, the
likelihood of genetic homophily in social networks is straight-
forward to motivate. Further, friends are similar along many
traits and behaviors and there is strong evidence that many of
these traits and behaviors have large genetic components (10­
13). Most friendships are geographically clustered and, to the extent
that variation in genotype is also clustered due to historical mi-
gration patterns, residential choices, and social policies, social
structure may affect the likelihood of genetic homophily.
In a recent publication (6), Fowler et al. used the sibling and
twin pair data from the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health to examine the presence of genetic homophily or
heterophily among friends. They found evidence for genetic
homophily for the TaqI A polymorphism within DRD2. Specifi-
cally, when they regressed the respondent's genotype on the
genotype of his/her friends, net of age, race, and sex characteristics
of the respondent and his/her friends, they observed a positive and
statistically significant regression coefficient (b = 0.11, P < 0.008),
which suggests a concordance of genotype among friends within
mutually nominated friendships. This is an important finding
because, as the authors argue, "homophily and heterophily in
friendships, expressed at the genetic level, may have notable
implications for our understanding both of the way that our
genes can shape our environmental exposures and the way that
our social environment can shape our behavior" (ref. 6, p. 3).
Gene­Environment Interplay and the Form of Genetic
Homophily
We argue that it is also important to examine the social context
in which friendships occur; it is possible that social factors may
structure relationships that enable or eliminate the possibility of
genetic homophily in friendships. For example, research in the
area of gene­environment interplay continues to show that ge-
netic associations are conditional upon environmental exposures
(14) and recent work has shown that large social contexts, such as
schools, denote important social structures that moderate ge-
netic influences on health and health behaviors (15). To date,
however, no existing research has examined the possibility that
the relative influence of genetic homophily is contingent upon
the social environment in which individuals interact with one
another. In this paper, we examine the possibility that the effect
of genetic homophily (for DRD2) varies considerably across
schools and then we test whether differences in economic in-
equality and racially stratified peer relations across schools ac-
count for observed school-level differences in genetic homophily.
There are reasons to expect that genetic homophily will depend
on the social inequality and racial stratification within schools. In
highly stratified social settings, characterized by high levels of
economic inequality, social factors such as class or race may be the
predominant mechanism through which friendships develop. As
such, the influence of genetic factors on friendship formation will
be reduced or nonexistent because there is very little room for
subtle genetic influences to take place. Similarly, schools in which
social inequality is relatively low or schools in which racial strati-
fication with respect to friendships is nonexistent provide greater
flexibility for individuals to choose their own environment. In these
settings, in which there is a greater degree of social latitude (e.g.,
more opportunities to socialize with dissimilar individuals and
greater individual autonomy over friendship selection), genotype
may become a relatively more important factor with respect to
friendship selection. In this sense, genetic homophily is a selection
process called active gene­environment correlation (16) in which
environmental selection into a particular neighborhood, school, or
friendship takes place in part because of genotype.
Alternatively, it is also possible that genetic homophily will be
the highest within social contexts that have the greatest level of

social inequality and highest degree of segregation of friends by
racial identification. In this case, individuals may be more likely
to befriend one another because these contexts may draw upon
other social, behavioral, personality, or physical cues that place
individuals within social locations (tracks within schools) that are
correlated with specific genotypes. In this social structural frame-
work, the correlation of genotypes among friends may be influenced
by the forces exerted by certain social structures rather than an
active form of friendship selection based on genotype. In other
words, if we do not see genetic homophily emerging in the social
contexts in which individuals have the greatest degree of social
autonomy, then it is likely that the source of homophily is not an
active form of gene­environment correlation (16). This per-
spective does not mean that genetic similarity in friendships is
any less important; it simply provides an alternative understanding
for the source of this genotypic similarity. That is, genotype may
evoke a particular environment for two individuals and this en-
vironment sets the stage for genetically similar friendships to
emerge. This evocative gene-environment correlation (rGE)
perspective is critical to social scientific inquiry into gene­envi-
ronment interplay because the selective or sorting process is
occurring at the level of the social institution (in this case
schools) rather than the individual level. The evocative gene­
environment correlation model typically focuses on parental­child
relationships (e.g., children who are more temperamental may
evoke fairly hostile and disciplinary environments from their
parents) but the same mechanisms may underlie decisions
about course scheduling, academic track, or study groups
within classes, all of which will cause genetically similar persons
to interact more regularly. This distinction (e.g., active vs.
evocative) is important because it allows us to test the assumed,
but to date untested mechanism undergirding genetic homophily.
The logic behind this analysis is strong empirical evidence that
shared race, sex, and/or socioeconomic status are among the
strongest predictors of adolescent friendship patterns found in
the literature. As outlined by Zeng and Xie (17), this pattern is
likely the result of an interaction between preferences for
homophilous friend ties and opportunities to create these ties,
and one central aspect of the determination of preferences for
homophilous ties is what is socially acceptable to others. From
this perspective, greater inequality and heterogeneity may offer
more opportunities for heterophilous ties but only if they lead to
increased social acceptability of heterophilous relationships.
However, most evidence suggests that the opportunity for hetero-
philous ties is not sufficient to produce these ties because of the
strong countervailing social sanctions against these ties (e.g., ref.
18). Students from different populations within the school may
be effectively "off limits" for friendships. Hence, in addition to
some level of opportunity, there needs to be social latitude for
pursuing these friendship links. Therefore, schools with larger
shares of "mixed-race" friendships (low racial stratification with
respect to friendship links) create an environment that allows
greater flexibility for individuals to choose heterophilous ties, as
social sanctions are lower for doing so and individuals with a
preference for heterophilous ties would allow this preference to
be expressed. Similarly, schools with lower social inequality may
suggest greater tolerance for heterophilous friend links, which
allows these preferences to be expressed.
Data
This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) (19). Add Health was designed
to examine health and health-related behaviors among a nation-
ally representative sample of adolescents in 7th through 12th
grades. In 1994, 90,118 adolescents from 134 schools completed
questionnaires about their daily activities, health-related behav-
iors, and basic social and demographic characteristics. Following
this in-school survey, 20,747 respondents were reinterviewed in
their homes between April and December of 1995 (the in-home
sample). Two aspects of this dataset are particularly important to
us: (i) genetic data, taken from the sibling pairs, and (ii) in-
formation on social networks. A genetic subsample of the in-
home sample was created, focusing on siblings. Identical and
fraternal twins were sampled with certainty. Full siblings were
sampled, disproportionately from the saturation sample schools
(where all students in the school were sampled for the in-home
survey, specifically designed to allow for network-based analysis
of entire schools). Individuals in the genetic sample were geno-
typed for six genes, and here we focus on a gene implicated in the
dopaminergic system (the dopamine receptor gene, DRD2) be-
cause this gene has demonstrated positive genetic homophily in
previous research (6). The Taq 1A polymorphism in the DRD2
gene is also a plausible candidate for friendship selection be-
cause it is consistently linked to behavioral phenotypes, such as
political ideology (20) and smoking (21), that may increase the
likelihood that two individuals will become friends.
The second aspect of the data that makes this study possible is
that students were asked to identify their friends in the surveys.
Our sample of students consists of all friendship pairs (identified
in either the in-school survey or one of the in-home surveys) in
which both the ego and the alter had information available on
their ethnic backgrounds, sex, and age. Furthermore, the alter
needed to have genetic information available whereas the ego
needed to both have genetic information and genetic information
from siblings, for use in the sibling transmission disequilibrium
test. It is worth highlighting the fact that our units of analysis are
friendship pairs rather than individuals. We present descriptive
statistics for our final analytical sample of 1,503 pairs in Table 1.
The sample was largely white and had a slight majority of females.
Both egos and alters averaged nearly 15.7 y of age.
We restricted analyses to those schools with more than 5
friend pairs. In the 41 schools that met this requirement there
was an average of 37 pairs per school. We also considered two
measures of school social inequality. Maternal education reports
were used to compute Gini coefficients (22) on the basis of the

distribution of maternal education within the schools. This esti-
mate describes the proportion of total years of education in a
particular school that is cumulatively attained across the distri-
bution of educational attainment (Lorenz curve) to the 45° line in
which there is no inequality in education; the value ranges from
0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). The second mea-
sure of inequality is the gross friendship segregation measure
used in Moody (23). Higher values of this scale indicate increased
likelihood that two students will be in a friendship if they are of
the same race compared with those who are of different races.
Methods
We extend the model used by Fowler et al. (6) to include information about
the clustering of friendships within schools. Consider the basic model pre-
sented in Eq. 1 in which the DRD2 genotype of individual j is associated with
the DRD2 genotype of his/her friend i, controlling for demographic charac-
teristics (e.g., sex, race, and age) of each individual in the pair (Xi
, Xj
), and ej
describes the error term for individual j. As with Fowler et al. (6) we are
sensitive to the possibility of population stratification--a process where the
tendency for individuals to reproduce with geographically proximate mates
leads to local genetic variation that could become distinct from other lo-
calities over time--mechanically inducing some positive correlation in gen-
otypes of geographically proximate individuals. To correct for this, they use
the deviation of DRD2 genotype for individual i from the mean genotype of
family k in which individual i is nested within family k (shown in Eq. 2, where
Wik
is DRD2ik
- DRD2k
and Bk
is simply DRD2k
). The within-pair component
(Wik
) is robust to population stratification and the slope for this term (1
)
captures genetic homophily and denotes the primary focus of this paper:

Our primary goal is to examine school-level variation in 1
and to provide an
alternative explanation of the genetic correlations found in the data be-
tween friends. Accordingly, we extend Eq. 2 to a multilevel model in which
we allow the genetic homophily coefficient (1
) to be random and to vary
from school to school, which is illustrated in Eq. 3. Here, individuals j and i
are clustered in schools (s) and the genotypic profiles at the school level are
controlled through a random intercepts specification (u0s
). Most importantly,
the school-level effects of genetic homophily are captured with the random
slope u1s
. Variation in the effect of genetic homophily is captured with u1s
(SD of the random slope) and it provides support for the hypothesis the
genetic homophily is conditioned by local social environments (e.g., if there
is no variance in the parameter estimate, then it suggests that the genetic
homophily effect is the same across all schools). We then include an in-
teraction between the within-pair genotype coefficient and school-level
factor Z (6
Zs
Wiks
). The inclusion of school-level factors and interactions with
the genetic homophily coefficient should reduce the level-2 SD (SD of the
random slope). That is, changes in the random slope variance indicate the
extent to which the measured school factors explain school-level differences
in genetic homophily.
Results
As a first step, we estimated general estimating equations similar
to those in Fowler et al. (6). Using the same methods, we were
able to replicate their main finding of a 0.11 coefficient for the
main effect of ego genotype minus siblings' mean on the alter
(see replication model in Table 2). We then estimated a multi-
level (random intercept) model including school-level random
effects that is otherwise identical to their model. This baseline
estimate in Table 2 examines the genetic homophily association
after considering the clustering of individuals within schools.
There is a large amount of variation in the dependent variable
across schools ðu0s
= 0:29Þ even after controlling for racial, ethnic,
and other demographic covariates. Thus, the genotypic frequen-
cies for DRD2 (the dependent variable) appear to be significantly
different across schools. The intraclass correlation coefficient,
2
u0s

u0s

= 0:21;
demonstrates that 21% of the genetic variation is occurring
across schools and clearly the social context is important. Fur-
thermore, these differences may be the reason why the coefficient
(1
= 0.05, P < 0.12) is reduced to a value that is not significantly
different from zero. Once school context is taken into consid-
eration, there does not appear to be any main genetic homophily
association, per se.
Model 1 extends the baseline mode by allowing for school-
level variation in the influence of ego genotype on the dependent
variable. This model adjusts for race, sex, and age but presents
only the homophily and school coefficients. The main effect is

significantly reduced (1
= 0.02, not significant) but there is
significant variation in this effect across schools [u1s
= 0:15;
2(2) = 9.6, P < 0.01]. In other words, we do not find support for
a general sense of genetic homophily. Rather, our results suggest
that the genetically homophilous friendships are more common
in certain social environments. Our hypothesis is that school-
level characteristics related to economic inequality and racial
dynamics within schools will explain some of this variability.
Models 2­4 introduce school-level predictors. Model 2 con-
tains the main effect of the racial friendship segregation measure
and the maternal education inequality measure (Alpha and Gini,
respectively) as well as the interactions of Alpha with the ego
genotype. This measure was of limited explanatory power as the
SD of the random slopes did not decrease by any noticeable
amount. Moreover, neither the main effect of genotype, the seg-
regation measure Alpha and the inequality measure Gini, nor the
interaction was statistically significant. However, in model 3 we
introduce the interaction of the Gini coefficient and the ego
genotype and although we do not demonstrate significance of the
main effect of the Gini coefficient, we show a significant (P <
0.05) effect of the interaction of these two variables (6
= 2.96).
More importantly, the SD of the random slope is decreased by
roughly one-quarter from 0.15 to 0.11. The substantive interpre-
tation of this interaction is that schools with greater levels of in-
equality seem to be schools where students are more likely to
make friends with those of a similar DRD2 genotype. One causal
mechanism that could lead to such a finding would be that highly
unequal schools tend to institute academic tracking policies.
Grouping by ability, which may induce grouping by race and/or
genotype, will constrain the type of "potential friends" because
one is more likely to be friends with classmates than with stu-
dents with whom one does not share time in the same class. These
results suggest that genetic homophily exists but the source of
homophilous relationships among genetically similar persons
may have more to do with external sources of control (e.g., evoc-
ative rGE) rather than an active form of gene­environment
correlation.
These interactive associations are shown graphically in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1, Left characterizes genetic homophily as a function of same
race friendships within schools (Alpha) and Fig. 1, Right does the
same for socioeconomic inequality (Gini). In both cases, the
genetic homophily is plotted for values at the 25th, 50th, and
75th percentiles for the distribution of these measures at the
school level. Consistent with the results in Table 2, Fig. 1, Left
shows no evidence for genetic homophily except for a weak re-
lationship in schools with highest levels of same-race friendships
(this association is not statistically significant). However, as
shown in Table 2, genetic homophily appears to be sensitive to
the level of socioeconomic inequality within schools such that
schools with the highest inequality levels also have the strongest
level of genetic homophily but genetic homophily within schools
with lowest levels of inequality is not significantly different from
zero. It is also important to note that although Gini and Alpha
are correlated across schools (r = 0.35), model 4 suggests they
provide different information when considering the friendship
selection process as a function of genotype. That is, social in-
equality within schools does not appear to structure genetically
homophilous friendships through increased likelihood of same-
race friendships.
Conclusion
Our results both are consistent with and provide important
extensions and qualifications to previous research. We find that
genetic homophily does play a role in friendship formation.
However, it is also clear that social context is a fundamental
precursor to these associations. Specifically, when we allow the
degree of correlation between friendship genotypes to vary by
school, we do not observe any main effect of genetic homophily
for DRD2. However, there is substantial variation in genetic
homophily across social contexts. Indeed, not only was there a
reduction in the overall magnitude of genetic homophily in the
sample once we controlled for schools, but also some schools
showed genetic heterophily. The substantial variation provides
some evidence for the possibility either that nonstratified schools
may allow students the greatest flexibility in choosing their
friends and hence the most opportunity for genetic homophily to
be expressed or that schools differentially structure opportunities
for the expression of genetic homophily either implicitly, purely
as a function of their stratified student body, or explicitly,
through policies such as tracking. Furthermore, when we include
school-level controls, we can "explain" part of the variability
across schools in levels of genetic homophily in friendships,
which gives some suggestive evidence of mechanisms linking
specific school characteristics with these friendship choices. Thus,
we find strong evidence that social context influences the degree
to which genetic correlation in friends may exist, and we show
that the evidence for DRD2 homophily depends critically on
social context.
This perspective is important. Although it does not necessarily
challenge the possibility of genetic homophily, it suggests that
social environments such as schools set the stage for more nu-
anced and typically unobservable selection factors. Our findings
suggest that the overrepresentation of genotypically similar indi-
viduals into friendships does not appear to be an active process of
selection by the students per se. Rather, the results suggest that
schools limit the scope of possible friendship formations because
of institutional forces placed upon their students. We use the
language of "evocative" gene­environment correlation because
we believe that genotype may evoke a particular environment to
which individuals are exposed rather than individuals actively
selecting certain environments. These mechanisms may have
antecedents within each student's educational career that have
accumulated over time or they could be linked to specific deci-
sions regarding course selections or sport participation.
Importantly, our study focuses on school environments but we
believe that similar associations may be relevant in more broadly
defined social environments. There are pronounced differences
in social inequality across and within countries and different
historical periods. As such, changes in the relative importance of

genetic homophily as a source of relationship ties as well as the
mechanism for homophilous relationships (e.g., active rGE or
evocative rGE) may be predicated on historical and geographic
changes in the distribution of social and economic resources.
Although this is certainly beyond the scope of this paper, the
clear differences across schools provide a rationale for pursuing
these questions on a larger social scale.
Our findings have further import because they show the neces-
sity of including factors from the social context in studies examining
genetic selection mechanisms as well as in studies examining ge-
netic effects on behaviors. Twin and sibling studies suggest that
most behavioral choices have strong genetic components, but if
shared understandings of these behaviors (like smoking) take place
among discrete groups of friends, who are also genotypically sim-
ilar, then norm formation and reinforcement are not independent
of observable genotype in the way often assumed in traditional
empirical research. More generally, our work suggests the need for
greater infusion of social context measures and theory in genetic
studies and also highlights the need for genetic factors to be in-
corporated into sociological theories of friendship selection and
influence. We encourage other researchers to consider this possi-
bility in future research studies.
We also encourage future researchers to exploit alternate
statistical methods to evaluate these processes. For example, our
analyses examine genetic similarity among individuals who are
already friends with one another. However, another question is
as follows: Given all pairs of individuals in a particular context,
do similarities in their genotypes predict an increase in the prob-
ability of their being friends? This requires information on
nonfriends and it cannot be answered with the methods pre-
viously discussed. However, exponential random graph models
(ERGMs; e.g., refs. 24 and 25) can potentially answer such a
question. With currently available data, only a small number of
schools (five) contain enough pairs of individuals with complete
data. Initial results from estimating ERGM models in these five
schools generally support the results in Fowler et al. (6), but we
also observed intriguing differences in the school-level genetic
homophily suggested by the random-effects estimates of Table 2
and the ERGM estimate. However, due to the small sample sizes
that are available these results are very preliminary. We plan on
conducting a more comprehensive investigation using these models
when the necessary data become available.
Finally, these findings are particularly important to social scien-
tific inquiry because recent research on gene­environment interplay
has emphasized gene­environment interaction (G × E) (15)
rather than gene­environment correlation (rGE). Some have
argued that operationalizing the environment using macrolevel
contexts such as state of residence reduces the likelihood that
rGE is driving the G × E findings (13). That is, if individuals with
particular genotypes actively select (or are selected into) par-
ticular environments, then it is statistically and substantively
difficult to tease apart rGE from G × E effects. This is important
because many of the phenomena studied by social scientists may
be partially influenced by subtle rGE mechanisms. Marriage,
fertility, and migration have all demonstrated moderately sized
heritability estimates (26, 27) but it is also possible that genotype
is associated not only with the socially relevant activities (e.g.,
marital status, employment status, residential location, engage-
ment in unhealthy behaviors, etc.) but also with whom one inter-
acts when engaged in these activities. This distinction complicates
the notion of "environmental exposure" and it suggests that non-
random (and now measurable) factors may lead similarly ori-
ented persons to form social ties. Most importantly, it suggests
that social interactions over the long term may occur increasingly
among genetically similar persons. Thus, although social mech-
anisms may set the stage for this source of homophily, is also
possible that homophilous relationships can affect the compo-
sition of the environment.
