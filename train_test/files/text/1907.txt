Association Between Sexually Transmitted Diseases
and Young Adults' Self-reported Abstinence
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The extent to which young
adults' laboratory-confirmed sexually transmitted disease results
and self-reported sexual behaviors are consistent has not been
assessed in a nationally representative sample.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The primary purpose of this study was
to determine whether young adults' reports of recent sexual
behavior (presence of penile/vaginal sex in the previous 12
months) correspond with the presence of laboratory-confirmed
nonviral STDs assessed by nucleic acid amplification testing.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Self-reported behavior has been the cornerstone of sexual
health research and clinical practice, yet advances in sexually trans-
mitted disease (STD) screening provide researchers with the opportu-
nity to objectively quantify sexual risk behaviors. However, the extent to
which young adults' laboratory-confirmed STD results and self-
reported sexual behaviors are consistent has not been assessed in a
nationally representative sample.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data are derived from participants who
completed wave 3 in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health. Young adults (N  14 012) completed an audio computer-
assisted self-interviewing survey and provided a urine specimen to
detect the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonor-
rhoeae, and a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect Trichomonas
vaginalis.
RESULTS: More than 10% of young adults with a laboratory-confirmed
positive STD result reported abstaining from sexual intercourse in the
12 months before assessment and STD testing. After controlling for
several sociodemographic factors, self-reported sex (versus those
who reported abstinence) in the previous 12 months was significantly
associated with testing positive, but the odds of testing positive were
only slightly more than twofold (adjusted odds ratio: 2.11 [95% confi-
dence interval: 2.097­2.122]).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate discrepancy between young adults'
positive STD status and self-reported sexual behavior. No significant
correlates of discrepant reporting were identified. From a clinical
standpoint, the discrepancies between STD positivity and self-reported
sexual behavior observed in this nationally representative sample sug-
gest that routine STD screening may be beneficial and necessary to
reduce STD morbidity among young adults. Pediatrics 2011;127:208­

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),
including HIV, are a significant source
of morbidity for adolescents and
young adults.1,2 Abstinence, monog-
amy, and consistent condom use are
the primary HIV/STD-protective behav-
iors that public health intervention ef-
forts target for adolescents and young
adults.3 Historically, self-reported be-
havior has been the cornerstone of
sexual health research from large ob-
servational studies, such as the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance and the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, referred to as Add Health,4,5 to
evaluating the efficacy of sexual risk-
reduction interventions.6­8 However,
advances in the microbiologic technol-
ogy in the detection of common sexu-
ally transmitted pathogens may pro-
vide an opportunity to objectively
quantify sexual risk behaviors of young
people.
Specifically, the advent of nucleic acid
amplification testing, a noninvasive
technologyfordetectingprevalentnonvi-
ral infections such as chlamydia, gonor-
rhea, and Trichomoniasis with high sen-
sitivity and specificity, may provide an
objective referent of adolescent and
young adults' self-reported penile/vagi-
nal sexual activity.5,9,10 Associations be-
tweenlaboratory-confirmedSTDpositiv-
ity and young adults' self-reported
sexual behavior has not been ex-
plored in a nationally representative
sample of US young adults. Given that
the science of HIV/STD prevention
for young people is predicated on
the critical assumption that self-
reported sexual behaviors are valid,
it is important to determine the de-
gree of association that exists be-
tween STD testing and self-reported
behavior in young adults. Although
some data suggest that self-report of
sexual behaviors may be prone to
bias,11­13 an evaluation using a nation-
ally representative sample has not
been reported.
The primary purpose of this study was
to determine if young adults' reports
of recent sexual behavior (presence of
penile/vaginal sex in the previous 12
months) correspond with the pres-
ence of laboratory-confirmed nonviral
STDs assessed by nucleic acid amplifi-
cation testing among a nationally rep-
resentative sample of young adults.
The secondary purpose of this study
was to identify potential factors re-
lated to discrepant reporting (ie, those
who had a laboratory-confirmed posi-
tive STD result but who reported ab-
staining from sexual intercourse in 12-
months before survey assessment and
STD testing) in this nationally repre-
sentative sample.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
Data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
were used for this study. Participants
were initially recruited in 1994 (grades
7­12) for wave 1 of Add Health. Stratified
sampling of high schools ensured that
the sample was nationally representa-
tive. At wave 1, 20 745 adolescents were
interviewed in their homes. In 2001 and
2002 (wave 3), a total of 15 197 of the
original participants were reinter-
viewed.Additionaldetailsaboutthesam-
ple and methods have been described
elsewhere.5
Data Collection
Data collection occurred in the partic-
ipants' homes. Self-reported mea-
sures in wave 3 were collected by in-
home interviewers using audio
computer-assisted self-interviewing to
reduce reporting bias to sensitive
health-risk behaviors. Evidence sug-
gests that this method of data collec-
tion optimizes the validity of adoles-
cent and young adults' responses to
sensitive questions.14 Wave 3 also in-
cluded the collection of biological
specimens to detect STDs. Participants
collected first-catch urine specimens
that were assayed for Chlamydia tra-
chomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
using the Abbott LCx Probe System (Ab-
bott Park, IL). Specimens were stored
at 2 to 8°C and analyzed within 96
hours after donation. Aliquots were as-
sayed for the presence of Trichomonas
vaginalis by using an in-house poly-
merase chain reaction enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay with estab-
lished and acceptable estimates of
sensitivity and specificity.15,16
Data Analysis
The analyses reported here are based
on data collected from the 14 012 wave
3 participants who consented to un-
dergo STD testing, which represents
92% of the wave 3 sample. There were
some differences in rates of refusal to
undergo STD testing as a function of
race (white and Asian participants
were slightly more likely to refuse),
age (those who refused were slightly
older), and education (those who had
completed high school were slightly
more likely to refuse). There were no
gender differences in rates of refusal.
Sampling weights provided by Add
Health were applied to all analyses to
maintain a nationally representative
sample. All subsequent references to
weighted percents in this article,
therefore, are presumed to accurately
reflect the young adult population of
the United States who originally were
a nationally representative cohort of
adolescents in 1994. Given the epide-
miologic evidence that suggests that
STDs are disproportionately prevalent
among minority youth, we compared
black, Hispanic, Asian, and other-race
participants (a combination of the re-
maining ethnic categories) separately
from white participants (the referent
category) in the analyses as a control
variable. Gender, age, and level of edu-
cation also were used in this capacity.
Analyses were conducted by using

Health's complex sampling design and

therefore, significance levels) for all
analyses. Procedures to perform a
design-based analysis using Add
Health data, described by Chantala and
Tabor18 were followed to both maintain
national representation and to obtain
unbiased parameter estimates. Logistic
regression models were developed, ad-
justed for the complex survey design, to
calculate adjusted odds ratios that per-

discrepant reports of abstaining from

RESULTS
Descriptive Findings
There were 6636 male participants
(weighted percent: 50.9) and 7376 fe-
male participants (weighted percent:
49.1). Sixty-seven percent of the
sample self-described as white
(7497 [weighted percent: 67.1]) and
16.4% self-identified as black (3097
[weighted percent: 16.4]). There were
2291 Hispanics (weighted percent:
11.8), 956 Asians (weighted percent:
3.7), and 171 in all other self-described
racial/ethnic categories (weighted
percent: 1.0). The mean age of partici-
pants in the sample was 21.9 years
(SD: 1.8 years), and 12 522 self-
reported that they had graduated high
school or received a general equiva-
lency degree (weighted percent: 88.2).
Overall, 11 039 (weighted percent:
79.7) reported having penile/vaginal
sex with at least 1 partner in the previ-
ous 12 months. Of all wave 3 partici-
pants who provided a urine sample for
STD screening, 964 (weighted percent:
6.0) tested STD-positive for at least 1 of
the 3 assessed STDs. Of the STD-
positive participants, 838 (weighted
percent: 89.5) reported sex with at
least 1 partner in the previous 12
months, 118 (weighted percent: 10.5)
reported abstaining from sexual activ-
ity during the previous 12 months be-
fore assessment, and 60 of the latter
participants (weighted percent: 5.9)
reported never having penile/vaginal
sex in their lifetime. Thus, 118 partici-
pants (more than 10% of the 964 par-
ticipants who tested positive for an
STD) demonstrated a discrepancy in
their STD test results and self-report of
recent sexual activity.
Results of Logistic Regression
Analyses
Controlling for age, level of education,
gender, and race (white), females
were 36% more likely than were males
to have a positive STD test (adjusted
odds ratio [aOR]: 1.36 [95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.35­1.36]; P  .002).
Race also was associated with a posi-
tive STD test; with black participants
being more than 6 times more likely
than white participants to test positive
(aOR: 6.56 [95% CI: 6.53­6.59]; P 
.0001). Hispanic participants (aOR: 2.44
[95% CI: 2.42­2.45]; P  .0001) and
other-race participants (aOR: 3.52
[95% CI: 3.47­3.58]; P  .0001) were
also associated with testing positive
for an STD. Age was not associated
with a positive STD test (aOR: 0.97 [95%
CI: 0.972­0.974]; P  .25), but partici-
pants who had a high school degree or
general equivalency degree were sig-
nificantly less likely to have a positive
STD test (aOR: 0.621 [95% CI: 0.618­
0.624]; P  .0001). Moreover, self-
reported sex (versus those who re-
ported abstinence) in the previous 12
months was significantly associated
with testing positive (aOR: 2.11 [95% CI:
2.097­2.122]; P  .0001). This finding
indicates that reporting penile/vaginal
sex increased the odds of testing pos-
itive for an STD by only just more than
twofold. Indeed, more than 10% of
those with a positive STD test self-
reported being abstinent in the previ-
ous 12 months.
A second logistic regression model was
constructed to identify the determinants
of discrepant findings (ie, a positive STD
test and self-report of abstaining from
sex in the previous 12 months) among
those who tested positive for an STD.
With age, gender, level of education,
and race (all minority groups com-
pared separately to white partici-
pants) entered into the model, findings
indicate that none of these sociodemo-
graphic factors were significantly as-
sociated with discrepancies between
STD test results and self-report among
STD-positive participants.*
DISCUSSION
Findings from this nationally represen-
tative sample of US young adults sug-
gest that the vast majority of STD-
positive participants (89%) had
concordant self-reports of recent pe-
nile/vaginal sex that matched their
STD-positive status. At the same time,
however, the findings suggest that
more than 10% of STD-positive partici-
pants had discrepant results. This
means they had a positive STD test but
reported abstaining from sex in the
previous 12 months. It is interesting to
note that 6% of STD-positive partici-
pants reported no lifetime history of
penile/vaginal sex.
In controlled analyses, it was intrigu-
ing that reporting penile/vaginal sex in
the previous 12 months increased the
odds of testing positive for 1 of 3 STDs
by only 2.1 times. In a logistic regres-
sion model, an obtained odds ratio of
this magnitude would represent a
modest effect. In this case then it can
be said the value of young adults' self-
report to the prediction of a positive
test result was only modest. This coun-
terintuitive finding suggests that sole
reliance on young adults' self-reported

participants and examined interactions between
each demographic category and self-reported ab-
stinence as predictors of STD test results, yielded
the same pattern of results.

penile/vaginal sexual activity as a
marker for STD acquisition risk may be
imprecise and, further, could be prob-
lematic. From a national behavioral sur-
veillance perspective, researchers
should be cautious about making infer-
ences regarding STD risk among this
population on the basis of responses to
self-report surveys assessing recent
sexual activity.
Although the findings indicate discrep-
ancies between young adults' positive
STD status and their self-reported sex-
ual behavior, the use of a disease
marker (ie, STDs), although represent-
ing an objective and quantifiable
marker of sexual behavior, is not with-
out controversy, nor is it a panacea for
avoiding bias associated with self-
report. With respect to intervention
studies, it is important to recognize
that reliance on incident STDs as a
measure to evaluate the efficacy of an
STD/HIV risk-reduction program may
not be an appropriate outcome for ev-
ery study. It is unlikely, for instance,
that the incidence of STDs will be
changed in a short-term study con-
ducted in a population with little sexual
activity or in a community with a low
prevalence of STDs. Conversely, popu-
lations with a high degree of sexual ac-
tivity and a high prevalence of STDs are
ideal for studying the effects of behav-
ioral interventions on STD incidence.
Moreover, studies that incorporate
STDs as the primary outcome measure
will need to be conducted with suffi-
ciently large samples to provide suffi-
cient statistical power to detect differ-
ences in STD incidence.
With respect to observational studies,
the use of STDs as a marker of risky
sexual behavior may not reflect the
true prevalence of risk behaviors in a
population. Indeed, being a marker of
disease, STD prevalence, observed in
cross-sectional studies, or STD inci-
dence observed in longitudinal stud-
ies, may represent a marked underes-
timate of actual sexual risk behaviors
(eg, proportion of young adults who
are sexually active or frequency of sex-
ual intercourse) in a young adult pop-
ulation. Acquiring an STD is not only a
function of unprotected sexual inter-
course, but also reflects the preva-
lence of STDs in young adults' socio-
sexual network, risk of sex partners
(ie, concurrency), and frequency and
proficiency of correct condom use.
The lack of associations regarding dis-
crepancies between STD status and
self-reported sexual behavior is strik-
ing. Although it may be reasonable to
expect that discrepancies in reporting
would vary by gender, race, age, or ed-
ucation, this was not observed. In es-
sence, discrepant reporting may be
likely among young adults regardless
of gender or race. Thus, future re-
search should test novel assessment
techniques designed to minimize oc-
currences of discrepant reporting for
diverse populations of young adults.
From a clinical standpoint, the discrep-
ancies between STD positivity and self-
reported sexual behavior identified in
this nationally representative sample
suggest that routine STD screening
may be beneficial and necessary to re-
duce STD morbidity among young
adults. In addition, given that no socio-
demographic characteristics differen-
tiated young adults with discrepant re-
sults (ie, STD-positive but reported no
recent penile/vaginal sex) from those
without (ie, STD-positive but reported
penile/vaginal recent sex), routine
screening for common STDs may be
useful for all young adults, regardless
of self-reported sexual history, race,
gender, or age.
The study is not without limitations,
and plausible alternative hypotheses
that may explain, in part, the finding of
discrepancies in having a laboratory-
confirmed STD and young adults' self-
reported abstinence. Foremost is the
absence of a baseline measure of STD
status. Specimens were collected only
as part of the wave 3 assessment; thus,
the STDs identified are "prevalent"
STDs, not necessarily incident infec-
tions. Also, only urine specimens were
collected for STD testing, which gener-
ally only detect STDs acquired through
penile/vaginal sex, thereby not detect-
ing STDs transmitted through other
means of sexual contact (ie, anal sex
or oral/genital sex). Although urine
tests could capture urethral infections
acquired through anal sex among men
who have sex with men,19 no informa-
tion was collected about this behavior.
Second is the duration of the time in-
terval from the wave 2 to the wave 3
assessment. The question used to cat-
egorize participants into those with
sexual experience and those who were
abstinent is based on the wave 3 retro-
spective assessment of young adults'
previous 12 months. Thus, given that
the time interval between wave 2 and
wave 3 assessments is longer than 12
months, coupled with the fact that STD
specimens were not collected in wave
2, participants could be accurate and
reliable in their reporting of absti-
nence (over the previous 12 months)
at wave 3 and still have an STD because
the infection could have been acquired
before the 12 month assessment inter-
val, at a time when they may have been
sexually active (eg, wave 2). Although
studies that report on persistent C tra-
chomatis infections among women
suggest it can persist for more than 1
year if left untreated,20,21 these same
studies also report that among asymp-
tomatic women, 50% of C trachoma-
tis infections clear within 1 year of in-
fection, and 82% within 2 years of
infection. In addition, clearance rates
differed by age of first sex, oral contra-
ceptive use, and serotype,21 and none
of these studies report on persistence
of infection in males, or clearance
rates in males. Thus, we have no way to
accurately estimate how often persis-
tent infections occurred in this mixed

gender sample of young adults. In ad-
dition, the accuracy of the STD tests
used in the Add Health study is less
than perfect, and therefore some
false-negatives and false-positives
were inevitable. It is difficult to esti-
mate the rate of false-positives as
these data were obtained from a na-
tionally representative community-
based sample and most available esti-
mates of the sensitivity and specificity
of the STD assays are based on clinic
samples. However, the false-positive
rate (typically computed by subtract-
ing a test's specificity from 1) was
likely quite small, as reported specific-
ities for the STD assays used by Add
Health are as high as 98.9% to 100% in
several studies.22­24 Another limitation
is the length of the interval that as-
sessed young adults' sexual behavior.
Given the length of the reporting inter-
val, the previous 12 months, young
adults' retrospective recall could be
inaccurate (they did have sex, but do
not recall having sex), making the as-
sessment of sexual behavior unreli-
able. In this case, the data would still
be invalid; however, the source of bias
would be attributable to poor recall,
not volitional underreporting of sexual
behavior, which is also a likely source of
bias. Indeed, recent data suggest that
shorter recall periods yield more reli-
able reports of sexual behaviors.25 Poor
recall, although plausible, may be more
likely among younger adolescents

CONCLUSIONS
The findings indicate discrepancy be-
tween young adults' positive STD sta-
tus and self-reported penile/vaginal
sexual behavior. Specifically, more
than 10% of young adults detected with
1 of 3 assessed STDs reported being
abstinent in the year before testing. In
addition, none of the sociodemo-
graphic factors assessed, including
age, level of education, race, and gen-
der, were significantly associated with
discrepant findings (ie, STD-positive
and self-reporting no recent penile-
vaginal sex) in this nationally repre-
sentative sample. The implications of
the findings suggest that although self-
report remains necessary, it may
not be sufficient to provide a precise
estimate of STD-positive young adults'
sexual risk behavior. When appropri-
ate, other objective and quantifiable
nondisease biological markers are
needed to more precisely gauge young
adults' sexual behavior as well as cor-
roborate their self-report of sexual be-
haviors. Finally, from a clinical per-
spective, the implications of our
findings are that all young people re-
ceiving clinical services, whether their
sexual history indicates they are re-
cently sexual active or not, should be
tested for prevalent STDs, like those
assayed in this study. Importantly, our
findings reveal that if pediatricians
and adolescent medicine physicians
do not test all young people, there are
likely a substantial number of missed
cases of STDs that will go undiagnosed,
untreated, and spread to future sex
partners.

HUNTING IN DECLINE: When I first arrived in Vermont more than 15 years ago,
the advent of deer hunting season was greeted with great fanfare. Each Novem-
ber, men (usually) would gather to discuss plans for "hunting camp", past
successes, and where the best hunting might be this year. The first day of rifle
season was an unofficial holiday as many businesses gave workers the day off.
This year, we hardly even noticed that deer hunting season had come and gone
and for the first time, our dog did not have to wear a red sweatshirt for two
weeks. Evidently, the decline in hunting is not specific to Vermont. As reported by
Todd Richmond from the Associated Press in the Burlington Free Press (Decem-
ber 19, 2010: Sports), hunting's popularity has waned across much of the U.S.
Although millions of Americans and thousands of Vermonters still hunt each
year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that in 33 states, sales of hunting
licenses declined over the past two decades. Some states, such as Massachu-
setts, have seen a 50 percent reduction in sales of hunting licenses. The reasons
for the decline include housing sprawl and a lack of interest among younger
people more comfortable sitting on a couch playing a video game than in a blind
waiting for a deer or a duck. The decline in hunting license sales has significant
consequences, particularly for state conservation agencies, as they are heavily
dependent on license fees for funding. States with the largest reduction in
license sales have had difficulty restoring natural habitats and have been
forced to look for alternative funding streams. Regardless of how one feels
about guns, some areas will lament the loss of hunting as a pastime.
