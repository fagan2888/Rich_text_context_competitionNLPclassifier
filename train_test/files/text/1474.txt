From Here to JUPITER
Identifying New Patients for Statin Therapy Using Data From the
1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Erica S. Spatz, MD; Maureen E. Canavan, MPH; Mayur M. Desai, PhD, MPH
Background--Guidelines for statin use currently focus on patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels. Recent
findings from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating
Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), however, indicate that statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk is also effective among
older persons with at-goal low-density lipoprotein but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. We estimate
the size of and describe this new population for whom statin therapy may now be indicated based on JUPITER's
findings.
Methods and Results--Using data from the 1999 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we estimate
that 57.9% of older adults (men 50 years and women 60 years), or 33 547 000 (95% CI, 32 217 000 to 34 877 000)
Americans, are currently taking a statin (24.4%) or indicated for statin therapy (33.5%). In addition, we estimate that
19.2%, or 11 144 000 (95% CI, 10 053 000 to 12 235 000), may become newly eligible for statin therapy. This includes
8 071 000 (13.9%; 95% CI, 7 173 000 to 8 969 000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 2 mg/L and low-density
lipoprotein 130 mg/dL (ie, those meeting "strict" JUPITER criteria) and an additional 3 073 000 (5.3%; 95% CI,
2 404 000 to 3 743 000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 2 mg/L and low-density lipoprotein of 130 to 160
mg/dL for whom JUPITER's findings might reasonably be extended. Thus, 80% of older persons may now have an
indication for statin therapy. Compared with those who would continue to have no indication for statin therapy, the
JUPITER group was more likely to be female, to be older, and to have obesity, hypertension, and the metabolic
syndrome.
Conclusions--JUPITER's findings have the potential to impact treatment recommendations for 20% of middle-aged to
elderly adults, thus increasing the proportion of this segment of the population with an indication for statin therapy to
nearly 80%. (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2009;2:41-48.)
Key Words:  prevention  C-reactive protein  lipoprotein  epidemiology  risk factors
Indications for statin therapy to prevent coronary heart
disease (CHD) have significantly expanded over the past
decade to include patients with ever lower serum low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.1­9 In addition to lowering
LDL, statins also decrease high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) levels.10­13 Although a growing body of literature
suggests that baseline and poststatin hs-CRP levels add
incremental accuracy to the prediction of cardiovascular
events,14­22 until now it had not been clear whether targeting
individuals with elevated hs-CRP but at-goal LDL values
exerts a positive effect on cardiovascular outcomes.
Clinical Perspective see p 48
The Justification for the Use of statins in Primary preven-
tion: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPI-
TER) sought to determine whether statin medications reduce
the risk of cardiovascular events in patients who are currently
not indicated for statin therapy based on LDL criteria but who
have elevated hs-CRP levels.23 In this trial, men 50 years
and women 60 years with no known CHD, LDL values
130 mg/dL, and hs-CRP values 2 mg/L were randomized
to rosuvastatin or placebo. The study was terminated early
after patients in the rosuvastatin group experienced signifi-
cantly fewer cardiovascular events and deaths than those
randomized to placebo.24
In light of these findings, the patient population for whom
statin therapy is recommended as part of a risk-reduction
strategy may be expanded beyond those with elevated LDL
values. The size and characteristics of this new population
have not yet been well defined. Thus, the objectives of this
study are to (1) estimate the number of individuals for whom
statin therapy may now be indicated based on JUPITER's

tion by comparing their sociodemographic and cardiovascular
risk factors to both those who meet criteria for risk-reduction
therapy by the current guidelines set forth by the National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/Adult Treatment
Panel III (ATPIII) and those who would continue to have no
indication for statin therapy.
SUMMARY
 Current National Cholesterol Education Program/
Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the use of
statin medications to reduce cardiovascular risk
focus exclusively on individuals with low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels above what is
recommended.
 On the basis of these guidelines, 58% of the
middle-aged to older adult population have an indi-
cation for statin therapy, over half of whom are not
treated.
 Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Pre-
vention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvas-
tatin's (JUPITER) findings suggest that individuals
without coronary heart disease who have at-goal
LDL values but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP) values benefit from statin therapy.
 On the basis of JUPITER's findings, we estimate that
19.2% of the middle-aged to older adult population,
or 11 144 000 (95% CI, 10 053 000 to 12 235 000),
may become newly eligible for statin therapy. This
includes 8 071 000 (13.9%; 95% CI, 7 173 000 to
8 969 000) with hs-CRP levels of 2 mg/L and LDL
levels of 130 mg/dL (ie, those meeting "strict"
JUPITER criteria) and an additional 3 073 000
(5.3%; 95% CI, 2 404 000 to 3 743 000) with hs-
CRP levels of 2 mg/L and LDL levels of 130 to
160 mg/dL for whom JUPITER's findings might
reasonably be extended.
 Thus, 80% of older persons may now have an
indication for statin therapy.
 Sociodemographic and cardiovascular characteristics
of this novel statin-eligible JUPITER group are
similar to individuals with an already established
indication for statin therapy.
Methods
Data Source
The data for this study come from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).25 Conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics, NHANES collects detailed health and
nutritional data on a nationally representative, multistage probability
sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the US.
NHANES includes both an in-home interview and a clinical exam-
ination at a mobile examination center (MEC). A subsample of
respondents, selected at random with a specified sampling fraction,
provides a fasting blood sample as part of their MEC examination.26
This subsample has its own designated weight, which accounts for
the additional probability of selection into the subsample component,
as well as the additional nonresponse. In 1999, NHANES transi-
tioned from being a periodic cross-sectional survey to adopting a
continuous data collection strategy, with data released every 2 years.
For the purposes of this study, we combined data from 3 NHANES
cohorts: 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004.
Study Sample
Consistent with the sociodemographic characteristics of the JUPI-
TER patient population, we restricted the analysis to men aged 50
years and women aged 60 years who were included in the fasting
blood draw subsample of the 1999­2004 NHANES (N2497).23
We excluded 175 individuals who had missing data on statin
eligibility (as described below), fasting LDL, hs-CRP, or lipid-
lowering medication use, extracted from the NHANES medication
file. Thus, the final sample size for this study was 2322.
We stratified the sample into 3 groups based on statin eligibility.
First, we identified individuals who were currently taking a statin or
indicated for statin therapy based on NCEP/ATPIII guidelines.8
Then, among the remainder of the sample, we used hs-CRP and LDL
values to identify individuals who would now be indicated for statin
therapy based on JUPITER's findings. Finally, the third group was
comprised of those without any NCEP/ATPIII or JUPITER indica-
tion for statin therapy. These groups are defined, in turn, below.
NCEP/ATPIII-Indicated Group
Individuals currently taking a statin were included in the NCEP/
ATPIII group regardless of their risk level or LDL value, as they
were assumed to have an established indication for statin therapy.
Among those not on a statin, NCEP/ATPIII indications for treatment
were determined by first stratifying individuals into 1 of 4 cardio-
vascular risk categories (high, moderately high, intermediate, or low
risk) and then comparing one's measured LDL level to their
risk-group-specific LDL goal. We did not consider treatment with
nonstatin, lipid-lowering medications in our eligibility stratification
as such individuals may still be candidates for additional statin
therapy.27 Subjects were deemed to be at the highest risk level if they
had CHD or a CHD risk equivalent, which included diabetes,
peripheral artery disease, symptomatic carotid artery disease, or
abdominal aortic aneurysm. CHD was assessed through self-report
of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or angina pecto-
ris.28 Diabetes was assessed by self-report of diabetes. Individuals
without a diagnosis of diabetes but with a fasting blood glucose
126 mg/dL were also coded as having diabetes.29 Peripheral artery
disease was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 mm Hg; and
self-report of stroke was used as a proxy for symptomatic carotid
artery disease. Given the available data in NHANES, we were unable
to determine the presence or absence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Per NCEP/ATPIII guidelines, individuals without CHD or a CHD
risk equivalent were assessed for the presence of major risk factors
of CHD (other than LDL), including age, smoking status, hyperten-
sion, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, and family history of
premature CHD. Hypertension was defined as having a mean
systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) 90 mm Hg, or reporting taking an antihy-
pertensive medication. HDL cholesterol was considered low if 40
mg/dL and deemed a negative risk factor if 60 mg/dL. Family
history of premature CHD was defined by reporting having a
first-degree relative who had had a heart attack or angina before the
age of 50 years.
For persons with 2 or more risk factors, we calculated their
Framingham risk score (FRS).30 Individuals with an FRS greater
than 20% were included in the high risk group, those between 10%
and 20% in the moderately high risk group, and those less than 10%
in the intermediate risk group. Individuals with 0 or 1 major risk
factor were considered to be low risk. FRS was not calculated for
individuals aged 79 years, as the FRS is not validated in this group.
To determine LDL goals for each risk category, we used the lower
LDL option for initiating lipid-lowering therapy recommended by
NCEP/ATPIII.8 We decided to use the lower treatment threshold as
current clinical practice is moving toward the achievement of lower
LDL values with medication therapy, more specifically with statin
medications.9 As such, eligibility for lipid-lowering therapy was
defined as follows: LDL100 mg/dL for the high risk group,

LDL130 mg/dL for the moderately high risk group, and LDL160
mg/dL for the intermediate and low risk groups. For those aged 79
years without known CHD or a CHD risk equivalent (and no FRS),
we set the LDL goal at 160 mg/dL.
JUPITER-Indicated Group
Individuals with no current NCEP/ATPIII indication for lipid-
lowering therapy were potentially eligible for inclusion in the
JUPITER group. For these subjects, hs-CRP and LDL values were
assessed. Those with hs-CRP2 mg/L and LDL130 mg/dL com-
prised our "strict" JUPITER group. We additionally included indi-
viduals with an hs-CRP2 mg/L and LDL between 130 and 160
mg/dL, the "extended" JUPITER group, as any recommendation for
hs-CRP screening based on JUPITER findings would likely be
extended to this cohort, assuming they had no other indication for
statin therapy. Importantly, individuals with hs-CRP values 10
mg/L were excluded from the JUPITER group and included in the
"Not Indicated" group (below), as levels this high are thought to
reflect systemic inflammatory processes other than cardiovascular
disease. Patients with inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus
erythematosus were excluded from the JUPITER trial and, at present,
it is unclear whether such subjects would benefit from statin
therapy.23
Not Indicated Group
Individuals without an NCEP/ATPIII or JUPITER indication for
statin therapy were included in the Not Indicated group. These
individuals had hs-CRP levels 2 mg/L (or 10 mg/L) and a
maximum LDL of 160 mg/dL.
Sample Characteristics
The JUPITER group was compared to the other 2 statin-eligible
groups, the NCEP/ATPIII and Not Indicated groups, based on
several sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Sociode-
mographic characteristics included gender, age, race/ethnicity, and
poverty income ratio, defined as the ratio of total family income to
the family's household size-adjusted poverty threshold.25 If a fami-
ly's total income is less than their threshold income value (deter-
mined annually by the US Census Bureau), then the family, and
every individual in it, is considered poor. Poverty income ratio
values 1.00 are below the official poverty threshold, whereas
poverty income ratio values 1.00 indicate income at or above the
federal poverty level.
Cardiovascular risk factors included smoking status, body mass
index, abdominal obesity, presence of impaired glucose tolerance or
diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Abdominal obesity
was defined as a waist circumference 88 cm for women and 102
cm for men. Individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes (as described
earlier) were considered to have impaired glucose tolerance if the
fasting blood glucose was 100 mg/dL and 126 mg/dL, and they
did not report use of insulin or a hypoglycemic medication. Hyper-
tension status was categorized into 3 levels: hypertension (SBP
140 mm Hg, DBP 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihyper-
tensive medication), prehypertension (SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg or
DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg), or normal blood pressure (SBP 120 mm Hg
and DBP 80 mm Hg).31,32 Metabolic syndrome was defined as the
presence of three or more of the following risk factors: abdominal
obesity, triglycerides 150 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL for men and
50 mg/dL for women, blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or self-
reported antihypertensive medication use, and impaired glucose
tolerance or self-reported diabetes medication use.32
Additionally assessed were global measures of cardiovascular
risk, including the Framingham and Reynolds risk scores.17,30 The
Reynolds risk score was calculated in all individuals using the
following variables: hemoglobin A1c, parental history of premature
CHD, current smoking, SBP, HDL, total cholesterol, and hs-CRP.
Use of hormone replacement therapy, defined as current use of
oral or transdermal estrogen in combination with progesterone or
alone, is also reported, as estrogen has been shown to elevate hs-CRP
levels. Finally, we assessed median values for hs-CRP, mean values
for LDL and HDL, and the presence of elevated serum creatinine
(2 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (150 mg/dL), and alanine
aminotransferase (180 mg/dL) in each of the 3 groups.
Data Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN to take
into account the survey's complex sample design33; this allowed for
appropriate variance estimation and weighting of the data. We began
by determining the proportion of the middle-aged to elderly popu-
lation (men aged 50 years and women aged 60 years) in each of
the 3 statin-eligible groups, specifically focusing on assessing the
size of the population that is currently eligible for statin therapy
according to NCEP/ATPIII guidelines and those that would be
expected to be newly eligible based on JUPITER's findings.
Weighted prevalence estimates were multiplied by the 2000 US
Census figure to estimate the number of individuals in each group.
Prevalence estimates and their associated 95% CI are rounded to the
nearest thousand. We then compared the sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics of the JUPITER group with each of the other
2 statin-eligible groups using 2 tests for categorical variables and
t-tests for continuous variables. Weighted percentages and means
with SEs are reported for each group, along with corresponding
probability values comparing JUPITER with the NCEP/ATPIII
group, and JUPITER with the Not Indicated group. Statistical
significance was set at the 0.05 level. For hs-CRP, median values
were calculated and group distributions compared using the Mann-
Whitney test in SAS version 9.1.3. The authors had full access to and
take full responsibility for the integrity of the data. All authors have
read and agreed to the manuscript as written.
Results
Statin Eligibility
The 1999­2004 NHANES included a total of 6544 men aged
50 years and women aged 60 years, representing approx-
imately 57 980 000 Americans. However, the present analy-
sis focused on the 2322 respondents in the fasting blood draw
subsample with complete data to determine statin eligibility.
As the results in Figure 1 show, over half (57.9%) of the
population (unweighted N1346, or an estimated 33 547 000
persons [95% CI, 32 217 000 to 34 877 000]) had an NCEP/
ATPIII indication for statin therapy. Of this group, 42%
(unweighted N508) were currently taking a statin. The
remaining 58% (unweighted N838) were judged to be
"undertreated," of which most were in the high-risk group
(unweighted N518).
Of the remaining 976 subjects, 330 (or 13.9% of the overall
population, representing 8 071 000 persons [95% CI,
7 173 000 to 8 969 000]) met "strict" JUPITER criteria, with
hs-CRP 2 mg/L and LDL 130 mg/dL. An additional 5.3%
(unweighted N130, or an estimated 3 073 000 persons
[95% CI, 2 402 000 to 3 743 000]) had an "extended" JUPI-
TER indication for statin therapy, with hs-CRP 2 mg/L and
LDL between 130 and 160 mg/dL. Finally, 22.9% (un-
weighted N516, or 13 289 000 persons [95% CI,
11 959 000 to 14 619 000]) had no indication for statin
therapy, making up the Not Indicated group.
Comparison of JUPITER and
NCEP/ATPIII Groups
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample,
by statin eligibility, are presented in Table 1. Compared with
the JUPITER group, the NCEP/ATPIII group included a
significantly greater proportion of men. However, the 2
groups were similar with respect to other sociodemographic

characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and poverty
status. The 2 groups were also comparable in terms of their
prevalence of current smoking, abdominal obesity, and hy-
pertension. Although the prevalence of diabetes and FRS
scores were significantly greater in the NCEP/ATPIII group
than in the JUPITER group, reflecting the centrality of the
FRS in determining need for statin therapy according to the
current guidelines, the 2 groups were similar in their distri-
bution of Reynolds risk scores. The JUPITER group had an
increased prevalence of class I and II obesity, and the
NCEP/ATPIII group had more metabolic syndrome; both of
these differences were statistically significant. The median
hs-CRP values in the NCEP/ATPIII and JUPITER groups
were elevated (2 mg/L), though the JUPITER group had
significantly higher values. LDL was significantly higher and
HDL was significantly lower in the NCEP/ATPIII group.
Comparison of JUPITER and Not
Indicated Groups
In comparing the JUPITER group with the Not Indicated
group, JUPITER subjects were significantly more likely to be
female and older. Distributions of race/ethnicity, poverty
status, and smoking status were similar between the 2 groups.
Although the 2 groups were also similar with respect to FRS
scores, individuals in the JUPITER group had significantly
greater Reynolds risk scores and were more likely to be obese
and to have hypertension and the metabolic syndrome, as
compared with those in the Not Indicated group. The median
hs-CRP value was significantly higher in the JUPITER group
than in the Not Indicated group, consistent with the stratifi-
cation schema for the 2 groups, though HDL and LDL levels
were similar in the 2 groups.
Finally, hormone replacement therapy use was signifi-
cantly higher in the JUPITER group as compared with the
NCEP/ATPIII and Not Indicated groups. Liver disease and
kidney disease, as defined by elevated liver enzymes and
creatinine, respectively, were rare, with no significant differ-
ences between groups.
Discussion
Using nationally representative data from NHANES, we
describe the magnitude of the impact JUPITER trial findings
may have on the US population. We estimate an additional
19.2%, or 11 144 000 (95% CI, 10 053 000 to 12 235 000)
Americans (men aged 50 years and women aged 60
years) may become newly eligible for statin therapy as a
primary prevention strategy. This group is in addition to the
33.5 million older adults with an already established NCEP/
ATPIII indication for statin therapy, over half of whom are
undertreated. Given our failure to reach current benchmarks,
and the possibility that the recommendations for statin ther-
apy may expand to include approximately 80% of the
middle-aged to elderly population, it is important to under-
stand the characteristics of these groups to target future
risk-reduction strategies more effectively.
An aim of our study was to explore potential distinguishing
features of the JUPITER-indicated group. Compared with
individuals with at-goal LDL cholesterol and low hs-CRP
(the Not Indicated group), JUPITER subjects were more
likely to be female and older. In addition, obesity (as measured
by both body mass index and abdominal circumference),
hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome were signifi-
cantly more prevalent in the JUPITER group. Interestingly,
JUPITER subjects shared many characteristics with NCEP/
ATPIII subjects, including sociodemographic factors and
prevalence of smoking, abdominal obesity, and
hypertension.

Global cardiovascular risk scores examined in this study,
namely the Framingham and Reynolds risk scores, deserve
further comment. The FRS was significantly higher in the
NCEP/ATPIII group than in the other 2 groups. This was as
expected, because current NCEP/ATPIII guidelines identify
traditional risk factors from which the FRS is derived and
further use the FRS to determine statin eligibility. However,
in the remainder of the population, the FRS did not help
distinguish between the JUPITER and the Not Indicated
groups, which, despite having different cardiovascular risk
profiles, had similar FRS scores. The Reynolds risk score,
which incorporates hs-CRP values, was similar for the
NCEP/ATPIII and JUPITER groups but higher in the JUPI-
TER group compared to the Not Indicated group. By defini-
tion, the JUPITER group had higher hs-CRP levels than the
other 2 groups. However, the Reynolds risk score is derived
from additional risk factors, beyond hs-CRP, that would have
been absent (eg, diabetes) or presumably more favorable in
the JUPITER group as compared to the NCEP/ATPIII group.
For this reason, the similarity in the scores between these 2
groups was not expected. There is some evidence to suggest
that the Reynolds risk score reflects not only elevated hs-CRP
levels, but also the increased cardiovascular risk not ac-
counted for with traditional risk measures such as the FRS. In
the Women's Health Study, approximately 20% of subjects
with FRSs between 5% to 10% and 10% to 20% were
reclassified using the Reynolds risk score into other risk
levels to predict more accurately actual event rates.34 Such
findings challenge our current understanding of individuals
deemed to be at low or intermediate risk, and may favor the
use of hs-CRP and the Reynolds risk score to better guide
cardiovascular risk prediction and reduction strategies.16,35

lipid-lowering medication to be used to achieve the LDL
goal. As statins have demonstrated unparalleled efficacy in
reducing primary and secondary cardiovascular events,27 it
seems prudent to limit the discussion on risk reduction to
statin therapy. Statins have pleiotropic effects beyond LDL
lowering. As a class, statins promote antiinflammatory and
antioxidant effects via reducing metalloproteinase activity,
increasing nitric oxide availability, and decreasing thrombus
proliferation.36 Statins have been shown to decrease hs-CRP
levels by about 15% to 35%.13,35,37 Of all available FDA-
approved statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at high doses
appear to have the greatest hs-CRP-lowering effects.13 Still,
however, LDL has remained the main target of statin therapy.
JUPITER is the first prospective study to demonstrate that
statin therapy lowers cardiovascular risk in patients with
at-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated hs-CRP levels.
Our study has the following limitations. There was likely
some degree of misclassification in our risk-group stratifica-
tion, given the reliance on one-time laboratory measurements,
self-reported data, and incomplete or imprecise risk factor
assessments. For example, in defining our high risk group,
assessments of symptomatic carotid artery disease and ab-
dominal aortic aneurysm were suboptimal. We used history
of stroke as a proxy for symptomatic carotid artery disease,
acknowledging that strokes may result from other noncarotid
etiologies; in addition, this variable would not capture those
with carotid artery disease that did not result in stroke. We
were not able to attain information regarding abdominal
aortic aneurysms, as this was not asked or assessed in
NHANES. Family history of premature CHD may have been
underestimated, as NHANES asks about disease in relatives
under the age of 50, whereas NCEP/ATPIII guidelines specify
male relatives under age 55 and female relatives under age 65 as
their cutoffs in defining premature CHD. In estimating the
Framingham risk levels for the 3 groups, we may have under-
estimated the high risk group, as individuals over 79 were not
scored. For each of these variables, however, we attempted to
replicate standard evaluation techniques and commonly used
definitions published in other studies.28,29,32,38 The definitions
used to assign NCEP/ATPIII risk were intended to result in the
most conservative estimates for the JUPITER population. It is
important to note that we included women on hormone replace-
ment therapy in the analysis of this study, acknowledging that
estrogen is known to elevate hs-CRP levels. We repeated our
analysis excluding women on hormone replacement therapy and
found substantively similar results.
In conclusion, targeting elevated hs-CRP levels for risk-
reduction therapy has the potential to impact approximately
20% of the adult population of men aged 50 years and
women aged 60 years who would otherwise not be recom-
mended for statin therapy. This translates into an estimated
11 144 000 adults, including 8 071 000 with hs-CRP 2
mg/L and LDL 130 mg/dL ("strict" JUPITER criteria) and
an additional 3 073 000 with hs-CRP 2 mg/L and LDL
between 130 and 160 mg/dL for whom the JUPITER findings
might reasonably be extended. Thus, based on existing
guidelines and JUPITER's findings, approximately 80% of
the middle-aged to elderly population in the United States
may now have an indication for statin therapy. Our study
suggests that JUPITER patients are largely similar to patients
who already meet NCEP/ATPIII criteria for statin therapy.
JUPITER's findings question our current strategies for car-
diovascular risk reduction and use of statin medications
exclusively in individuals with cardiovascular risk and LDL
cholesterol above what is recommended. Expanding recom-
mendations for statin therapy to include individuals with
at-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated hs-CRP values will pose
increasing challenges for health care providers and systems
already struggling to reach individuals with an NCEP/ATPIII
indication for statin therapy, but offers a potential opportunity
for advancing risk-reduction strategies.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Current strategies for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, based on guidelines from the National Cholesterol
Education Panel/Adult Treatment Panel III, focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in individuals
with increased cardiovascular risk and above-goal LDL values. A new clinical trial, Justification for the Use of Statins in
Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), showed improved cardiovascular outcomes
in patients without coronary heart disease who had at-goal LDL values but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
values and were treated with a statin medication. We estimate that these findings have the potential to impact 20% of
the adult population of men aged 50 years and women aged 60 years who would otherwise not be recommended for
statin therapy. This translates into an estimated 11 144 000 (95% CI, 10 053 000 to 12 235 000) adults, including 8 071 000
(95% CI, 7 173 000 to 8 969 000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 2 mg/L and LDL 130 mg/dL ("strict"
JUPITER criteria) and an additional 3 073 000 (95% CI, 2 404 000 to 3 743 000) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
2 mg/L and LDL between 130 and 160 mg/dL for whom the JUPITER findings might reasonably be extended. Thus,
based on existing guidelines and JUPITER's findings, 80% of the middle-aged to elderly population in the United States
may now have an indication for statin therapy. Expanding recommendations for statin therapy to include individuals with
at-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values will pose increasing challenges for health
care providers and systems already struggling to reach individuals with a National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult
Treatment Panel III indication for statin therapy but offers a potential opportunity for advancing risk-reduction strategies.
