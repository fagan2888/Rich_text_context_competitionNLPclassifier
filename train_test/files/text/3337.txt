At the very beginning, I would like to clarify the theme of
my address, because its title may not be self-explanatory.
The theme is to affirm the fact that there is a place where
contemporary music, composed from 1945 to the present, is
produced, divulged, and disseminated to other places and
countries in Europe and outside. The group of agents and
institutions that is active in this particular field of music cre-
ation represents a power device capable of pronouncing
inclusions and exclusions in a way close to the concept of
power theorized by Foucault (1998), especially in respect of
not having a subject: There is no one individual responsible
for the exercise of such power. There is not only a vast net-
work of agents, teaching institutions, and systems that is
important in putting in place the acts of power but also a type
of internalized functioning grounded in types of discourse
that mold, produce, and reproduce the reality they describe.
The topic of my article reads thus.
The Space of Enunciation
of New Music
My central claim is that since 1945, a new subfield of cul-
tural production of restricted circulation has been coming
into being and that its space of enunciation is as reduced, or
even more reduced, in geographical terms than ever before.
The concept of space of enunciation has been proposed by
postcolonial theories, mainly by scholars of non-European
origin, such as Gayiatri Spivak, Homi K. Bhabha, Dipesh
Chakrabarty, Arjun Appadurai, and the Portuguese sociolo-
gist Boaventura de Sousa Santos, among others. Reputed to
be intellectuals in their areas of third-world countries and
relocated as teachers at American universities, that is, having
their space of enunciation in the core countries of the world
system, made them question the consequences of their own
relocation. One of the most resonant topics is the title of an
article by Spivak: "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (Ashcroft,
Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2006, pp. 28-37).
Undeniably, Portuguese music is, and always has been, a
subaltern musical expression in the European context that is,
to quote two Portuguese composers who have written on this
matter, "ignored, neglected, invisible, despised and dis-
carded" (Delgado, 2001; Lopes-Graça, 1989); this makes the
problem of the location of culture a crucial issue.1
From an analysis of the location in which contemporary
music can exist--in the true sense of the word--it is probably
much easier to notice the musical expressions from periph-
eral countries of Europe, such as Portugal, than those from
the core European countries where the absence of such musi-
cal expressions usually goes unnoticed as if they were truly
nonexistent.
Others
In my opinion, this is one aspect that makes this process of
subalternity invisible to almost everybody, including the
scholars who write about otherness, alterity, and so on. From
the viewpoint of a Western scholar of the core countries, the
"Other" is the African, the Asian, and the Arab. These con-
cerns of the musicologists for Western music and its others
have mainly two reasons. First, musicology has recently
found out that "classical music," in spite of its traditional

European Music After 1945 as
a Restricted Space of Enunciation
António PinhoVargas1,2
Abstract
In this article, starting from the contributions of Pierre-Michel Menger and some sociological concepts of Boaventura de
Sousa Santos and other postcolonial authors, the author proposes an analysis of the new musical structures created after
1945 in the new music field in Europe as a construction regulated and dominated by the core countries, critically seen from
the vantage point of observation of a peripheral and subaltern country of Europe.

claims to universality, is the product of musicians mainly of
Germany, Italy, and France.2 Therefore, it is a specific cul-
tural tradition and a specific musical tradition. That is why
the titles of traditional "Histories of Music" have been
replaced more recently by the new title, "History of Western
Music" (Grout, 1983; Taruskin, 2001).
The second reason is more important. Many articles and
journals are now dedicated to musical expressions other than
classical music. Music such as jazz, pop, rock, and world
music have recently entered the curricula of academia, espe-
cially in the English-speaking countries. This is largely an
outcome of the many changes that swept the musical world
and, to some extent, of the presence of the Other on the hori-
zon nearby. After the massive displacement of millions of
people coming from outside Europe, the space of enuncia-
tion of many kinds of so-called ethnic musical expressions
has become the European metropolis. Suddenly, the music of
those very distant Others has become quite visible to
European musicologists on their local horizon in London,
Paris, and Berlin.
Earlier, it was not like this. Only those who traveled long
distances could carry descriptions of the musical expres-
sions. Now, they are there wherever the Other is present.
Although present, the Other is still Black, Muslim, Hindu, or
Buddhist, and all the theories of multiculturalism are an
attempt to deal with this new situation and new presence.
That said, I think the most conspicuous Other by being
absent in the contemporary music field is the composer from
the European peripheral countries.
The New Music Space: Menger
I shall now present my main argument, which is broadly simi-
lar to that in the article by Menger (2003) published in Jean-
Jacques Nattiez's encyclopedia Musiques titled "Le Public de
la Musique Contemporaine." Menger begins his argument
pointing to the separation between classical music and what he
calls the "creation field." His separation refers to the one "in
concert life, between concerts with a body of works from the
historical repertoire and concerts of creation of new works."
He argues that "this historic evolution is that of a progressive
dissociation, during the course of the 20th century, between the
function of interpretation of historical works and the creation
of new works, including their respective public spheres"
(Menger, 2003, p. 1168). For him, this separation has
a substance--that of the schism that opposed multiple
languages of high contemporary music to the language
in which classical repertoire was written, that is, tonal-
ity in its various aspects and stages. It has its actors, its
audience, but also its cultural administration function-
aries and a network of public radios, which support
and commission the production and the diffusion of
works that do not have a direct or immediate market.
It has its patrons, more active and present in the
Anglo-American world. (Menger, 2003, p. 1169)
In continental Europe, however, this role is assumed
mainly by the state. Menger continues to state, "It has its
institutional chronology, that of specialized ensembles, festi-
vals, research and production centers." Finally, he writes,
that, progressively, music creation coming from the
postwar avant-garde currents has produced the first
and most successful of the models of a market widely
supported, controlled and administered by profession-
als of creation, fed by public organizations or musical
institutions in public or private partnerships. (Menger,
2003, 1176-1177; italics added)
These are the main features of what I call the subfield of
contemporary music. Menger considers that
the character of the "population" of small organiza-
tions promoting contemporary music is very heteroge-
neous; specialized associations of musicians and
composers--also subsidized--ensembles working
within universities or conservatories--which happen
frequently in the United States--but also more infor-
mal initiatives related to other avant-garde artistic
milieux, as is the case in Downtown New York.
Considering the specific demand that exists in the new
music field, Menger contends that within "the traditional
market, demand comes from ordinary consumers, while in
the specialized sphere of new music, there is an intermediate
demand"; this demand, according to Menger, "is formed by
composers, critics, cultural administrators, editors, musi-
cians, teachers, animateurs culturels, students, etc." Menger
advances the hypothesis of a possible synchronization
between the specialization of these circles of diffusion and
the conditions of creative work, "that is, the specialized char-
acter of these circles has direct implications for the way
composers compose." (Willson, 2001, pp. 45-46).
For Menger, "the pieces are written according to the
norms of permanent aesthetic research, which is the priority,
in their value judgment, for the public not in the main com-
prising informed or traditional consumers, but professionals
and experts of the art," who are finally referred to by Bourdieu
as "other producers" (Bourdieu, 1993).
I would like to cite here the example of Emmanuel Nunes,
the only Portuguese composer who can claim a presence in
the subfield. In an interview in 2000, regarding his living in
Paris, he reacted, "to do what I want to do, I have to live
where I live."3
When I read his statement, I thought that it could very
well be the other way around; that is, the fact of living in Paris,
as an active member of the field, recognized by his peers,
could, in a certain way, force him or lead him (consciously or
unconsciously) to compose the way he composes. At least, it
indeed creates objective conditions, concerning expectations,
ideas of style, and aesthetic assumptions that are commonly
Vargas 3
shared by most agents of that Parisian field, which create cer-
tain social constraints that would be quite different had he
lived somewhere else, say, England, China, or Portugal.
Emigrants After 1945
Where is the place of enunciation of contemporary music
between 1945 and now? From that time on, a new figure, the
emigrant composer, has emerged with the passage of time to
achieve great visibility in the countries of the European cen-
ter, and this allows us to identify the location of that space.4
Confining to the most relevant cases, I cite the following
examples: Maurício Kagel, an Argentinian who emigrated to
Germany in 1957, where he died this year; Iannis Xenakis, a
Greek (Romanian-born) who emigrated to France in 1947,
and later died there; György Ligeti, who left Hungary for
Germany in 1956 (through Austria), having died in Vienna in
2006; Isang Yun, who arrived in Germany from South Korea
in 1955, where he died in 1995; the Hungarian Peter Eotvos,
a resident of Germany since 1966; the Romanian Horaiu
Rdulescu, residing in France since 1969; the Bulgarian
André Boucourechliev, residing in France since 1949; and
many others (Sadie, 2001).5
All these composers definitively put down roots in the
central countries, which in fact possessed the structures asso-
ciated with the new music: the music editors with whom they
signed contracts, the radio stations that lent support and pub-
licized their music, the cultural institutions that are in a posi-
tion to commission new works, the orchestras, the festivals,
the publications, and so on.
This wave of composers' emigration from peripheral
areas to the countries of the center can no doubt be explained
as due to the concentration of resources in those countries,
the very specialized nature of the musical currents dominat-
ing the period, and the political-cultural context of the Cold
War, which, in the West, gave large-scale support to artists of
the avant-garde against Soviet art in its "socialist realism"
and antiformalist modes. Another reason could be that, as
George Steiner told us, remaining on the periphery means
being doomed to the fatality of "minor languages," that is, to
a certain form of nonexistence. Two other aspects are worth
noting here (Steiner, 1996).
First, the end of Cold War made this process even more
acute with the emigration of composers, such as Arvo Pärt
(1980), Victor Suslin (1981), Alfred Schnittke (1990), Sofia
Gubaidulina (1991), Giya Kancheli (1992), and György
Kurtág (1993), originally from the former Soviet Union and
its satellite countries, to Germany, and Elena Firsova (1991)
and Dimitri Smirnov (1991) to the United Kingdom.6
Second, the centrality attained by Institut de Recherche
Acoustique Musique (IRCAM), the institution founded and
directed by Pierre Boulez in 1978, deemed as "the most over-
whelming rescue operation of a contemporary art which a
State has ever placed at the disposal of a composer," (Nattiez,
1984, pp. 353-354) promoted a regular, and at times definitive,
flow of composers from other countries to Paris, for example,
the Finnish Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho (1982 in
Paris), the South Korean Unsuk Chin (in Germany since
1985), the Portuguese Emmanuel Nunes (in Paris since 1964
and at IRCAM in the 1990s), the Argentinian Martin Matalon,
the Italian Marco Stroppa, and many others. Even when con-
sidering composers from countries, which would otherwise be
viewed as central, such as the United Kingdom, it is important
to note that the following composers spent repeated and
important spells of time at IRCAM: Jonathan Harvey, Brian
Ferneyhough, Harrison Birswistle, George Benjamin, and the
American Tod Machover. This trend underscores the fact that
tenure at IRCAM became almost compulsory to legitimize a
position of distinction in the contemporary subfield.7
Emigration to the center amounted, from a musical point
of view, to adopting the underlying principles of dominant
currents, with particular emphasis on postserialism, a process
that was considered very important in the field even in our
time. Bhabha's postcolonial theory designates this process as
"mimicry" (see Bhabha, 1994); the fascination that the
metropolis exerts on the emigrant plays out on the desire to be
the same, and thus, in this musical field, there is barely a
glimpse of otherness. This process, ongoing among artists
and intellectuals, has, as its literal opposite, the mass process
of emigration from former colonies to the West. Unlike the
individual, cultured emigrant, motivated by the aesthetic and
experiential attraction exerted by the space of enunciation of
the musical center, the waves of population heading from for-
mer colonies of the European powers, bring with them their
language and culture, which, rooted as they almost always are
in oral traditions, allow the processes of miscegenation and
hybridism with Anglo-American pop-rock, endowed with
overwhelming global hegemony. Differently, multicultural
issues are barely voiced in the contemporary subfield.
The concern of the "travelling composer"--to use Edward
Said's expression (Said, 2002)--is not to affirm difference,
but rather to maximize the possibility of his or her being
inserted in the field, absorbing its techniques, cultivating its
ways, and becoming part of the preexisting mode of expres-
sion. Despite the major political mutations between 1945
and 2000, the travelling composer's destination remained
circumscribed, in Europe, almost exclusively, to two of the
central countries, France and Germany.
Based on empirical analysis of these facts, it is possible to
describe the subfield of contemporary music as a given space
of enunciation, outside which any artistic expression appears
doomed to its local character and, consequently, to silence
and then to absence in transnational space.
The importance of identifying this specific space of enun-
ciation in contemporary music and its subfield can be
viewed in other aspects. Between 1950 and 2000, inclusion
in a European festival of a work by a travelling composer was
never meant to be of any interest to music, coming as it did
from an "external" place; instead, it was considered simply as
the inclusion of an active agent, proximate and integrated in
the field, delocalized with regard to his origin, and relocalized
in the center. More specifically, from the viewpoint of the
4 SAGE Open
center's institutions and specialist programmers, presenting a
work by Xenakis, Kagel, Ysang Yun, or Nunes did not mean
any programmatic interest on the part of the organizers of
Greek, Argentinian, South Korean, or Portuguese music. What
it did mean was that the field, in setting itself up as universal,
considering the works as works-in-themselves and the compos-
ers as individual authors, with no links to any particular con-
text--thus, universal--included in the subfield's hard core the
works by these authors as authors who were proximate to them,
and who inhabited and shared the same space of enunciation,
and the prevailing ideology preventing the works from being
considered as anything but "universal."
It is with regard to the space thus constituted, its working
criteria, and its capacity to irradiate that we must analyze the
absence of Portuguese music, as much as music from other
peripheral European countries.
Kurtág's Example
By way of an example, I would like to add that in 1968, a piece
by György Kurtág--"The Sayings of Peter Bornemisza"
(1963-1968)--was premiered in Darmstadt. According to
Rachel Beckles Willson, that year "an unprecedented num-
ber of ensembles from eastern Europe were in residence."
And, she adds that "the vocabulary of almost all nine reviewers
reveals the difficulty they had with responding to premières
from those peripheral regions of Europe." Neue Zur
..cher
Zeitung, the Hungarian concert, was interesting from the view-
point of "cultural history," and the Eastern bloc orchestral
works from the viewpoint of "information" (Willson, 2001).
Kurtág's piece, in spite of "a good word or two" for it, pro-
duced "major reservations." Rachel W. Willson quotes, thus,
"the material exhausted itself," "the Spring (one section of the
piece) was unconvincing," and "the piano part sounded like a
bad imitation of Stockhausen." Another critic writes that "the
piece could not disguise its roots in the nineteenth century." For
Rachel Willson, Kurtág evidently drew on the 19th century the
wrong way, and for the students of the course, "`The Sayings'
was too nineteenth century" (Willson, 2004, pp. 131-132).
Let's see what Willson writes in the New Grove 2000 edi-
tion entry: "The Sayings of Péter Bornemisza (1963-1968)
op.7, a 40-min song cycle for soprano and piano which was
Kurtág's first vocal work since before 1956, crowned this
first mature compositional phase." And she adds,
The Sayings of Péter Bornemisza made no impact on
Darmstadt at its world premiere there in 1968, and for the
next five years Kurtág was unable to make significant
progress, despite a year of study in West Berlin
(1971) supported by the Deutscher Akademischer
Austauschdienst. (Willson, n.d.)
It can be said that, during this period, the pieces com-
posed outside the core countries of Europe found it very dif-
ficult to convince the members of the field (critics, students,
and so on) who were unable to understand their musical
language for ideological and aesthetic reasons. In this sense,
the reception of Kurtág's piece says more about the field
than about the piece.
But 13 years later, in 1981, another piece was presented in
the West. According to Willson,
["Messages of the Late R. V. Troussova"] op.17 was his
most substantial work since op.7, and its success trig-
gered the wider dissemination of Kurtág's music out-
side Hungary. It was commissioned by the French state
and the Ensemble InterContemporain. The latter, with
Adrianne Csengery, gave the première in Paris in 1981,
conducted by Sylvain Cambreling. (Willson, n.d.)
My claim is that this new piece by Kurtág was presented
under three new conditions not at all related to a global pre-
sentation of Hungarian music: First, it was performed by a
prestigious Western ensemble; second, it was commissioned
by the French State; third, it therefore had the powerful bless-
ing of Boulez because of which, even before the concert, it
was legitimized, accepted, and recognized by the structural
functioning of the field.
My Criticism
What are the most negative consequences of this centralized
subfield, with its extreme concentration of structures, insti-
tutions, experts, and instruments (ensembles and musicians)
and having a particular ideology?
1. Once you are not accepted, or recognized by these
agents (who are, in any case, few in number), you
are excluded from the space of enunciation and
from that specific public sphere. As a secondary
consequence, local composers are also neglected
and subalternized in their own local space of enun-
ciation and in their own countries because in each
country, outside the center, there are many who,
acting as local agents of the power of the center,
share the same values that organize and regulate
the subfield.
2. The recognized restricted area, the restricted num-
ber of agents, and the restricted number of ensem-
bles, festivals, and so on can function as a closed
world divorced from the rest of the world. But the
institutions, being heavily subsidized or supported
by the State, cannot see their own insulation.
They are blind to the smallness of their world, blind to the
irrelevance of the social impact of their music, and blind
even to their own blindness.
In 1999, a new European institution--The Résaux Varèse--
was created by programmers of cultural institutions and direc-
tors of new music festivals in several European countries. This
includes four institutions from French-speaking countries, one
of which is IRCAM, and another four from German-speaking
countries, which together impart a position of dominance to
Vargas 5
the French­German axis. It has the objective of coordinating
resources among the members and enabling them to articulate
the circulation of projects. In a way, this new institution insti-
tutionalizes the previously described functioning.
Conclusion
It seems certain that the way the contemporary subfield
functions, it would ultimately lead to wasting artistic and
aesthetic experiences. The restriction that presides over its
inclusion criteria, both at aesthetic and geographical levels,
implies forcefully a wide range of exclusions.
Not long ago, António Jorge Pacheco, the artistic director
of Porto Concert Hall, Casa da Música, and also a new mem-
ber of the Réseaux Varèse, announced that his programming
criterion was based on relevance, which incidentally was
repeated by the majority of those responsible for cultural
institutions.8 The issue to be addressed is that of knowing the
procedures, which, within the subfield, produce the authority
that permits the exercise of declaring who is relevant. It is
precisely on some of these procedures that this text has
sought to cast light on.

Notes
1. This paper was read in the International Conference of Music
Sociology held in Lisbon in 2008, and it partially derives from
a PhD research investigation, now concluded, on the absence of
Portuguese music in the European context. There are of course
other peripheral countries where the same issues certainly apply.
2. It is obvious that, especially since the 18th century, the Euro-
pean musical life has been very much centralized around the
most important cities of the central countries.

pened before and during the Second World War, when many

7. Of course there were other centers that had identical symbolic
importance, especially Darmstadt during the first decades after
the war. However, the subtitle of Celèstin Deliege's book in
2000 de Damstadt à l'IRCAM attests the real importance of the
two locations but, more, draws the symbolic geocultural line
that defines the borders of the subfield.
