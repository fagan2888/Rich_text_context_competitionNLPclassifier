Introduction
Health anxiety refers to an exaggerating fear and persistent
worry about one's health, along with beliefs that one has an ill-
ness or may contract a serious one in the future (Taylor &
Asmund, 2004). Health anxiety, as conceptualized by Longley,
Watson, and Noyes (2005), consists of four dimensions: alien-
ation, reassurance-seeking, absorption, and worry. Alienation
is the interpersonal dimension of health anxiety and refers to
one's tendency to believe one is ill despite evidence to the con-
trary and that others are unconcerned about one's health.
Although this dimension was originally considered to be a cog-
nitive one, it seems to reflect more interpersonal content rather
than cognitive content. Reassurance-seeking is the behavioral
dimension of health anxiety. It refers to one's tendency to seek
social support for perceived health concerns.Absorption repre-
sents the perceptual dimension of health anxiety and refers to
one's tendency to focus on bodily sensations. The fourth
dimension of health anxiety, namely, worry, which is an affec-
tive one, refers to one's tendency to worry excessively about
illness and health.
Health anxiety ranges from mild and transient to severe
and chronic, and can be present among clinical and non-
clinical samples (Langley et al., 2010). It is typical for people
to experience mild forms of health anxiety; concerns regard-
ing bodily symptoms may be adaptive and facilitate the early
detection of a medical condition (Asmundson, Taylor, &

Exploring the Role of Neuroticism and
Insecure Attachment in Health Anxiety,
Safety-Seeking Behavior Engagement,
and Medical Services Utilization: A Study
Based on an Extended Interpersonal
Model of Health Anxiety
Fotios Anagnostopoulos1 and Tzesiona Botse1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to explore an extended interpersonal model of health anxiety, according to which health-
anxious individuals are trapped in a vicious circle of health-related reassurance-seeking, alienation from others, and worry
about health, while somatic absorption with body sensations, insecure attachment, neuroticism, safety-seeking behaviors, and
medical services utilization were also included in the model. Data were collected from 196 Greek university students using
standardized instruments. Results indicated that anxious attachment was directly related to absorption ( = .163, p < .05) and
alienation ( = .204, p < .05), while avoidant attachment was directly related to absorption ( = -.344, p < .001), reassurance-
seeking ( = -.130, p < .05), and alienation ( = .148, p < .05). Neuroticism was positively and significantly associated with
all dimensions of health anxiety. Absorption, alienation, and anxious attachment were related to medical services utilization,
which, in turn, was related to safety-seeking behaviors ( = .200, p < .01). Neuroticism and anxious attachment were also
indirectly and positively associated with worry. Moreover, absorption was positively related to worry and reassurance-
seeking, worry was positively related to reassurance-seeking, and alienation was positively related to worry. Study results
highlight the key role that interpersonal (e.g., alienation from others) and perceptual factors (e.g., the tendency to focus on
bodily sensations) can play in health anxiety maintenance, and the importance of anxious and avoidant attachment in safety-
seeking behavior engagement. Implications of the results and suggestions for future research and practice are outlined.

Cox, 2001). However, continuous and unwarranted health-
related worries are distressing and maladaptive. Health anxi-
ety can be a feature of various psychiatric disorders, such as
panic disorder, disease phobia, obsessive-compulsive disor-
der, and somatoform disorders. A severe form of health anxi-
ety is hypochondriasis, characterized by preoccupation with
unwarranted fears of having, or the idea that one has, a seri-
ous disease, based on a misinterpretation of one or more
bodily symptoms (American Psychiatric Association [APA],
2000). The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medi-
cal evaluation and reassurance, and causes clinically signifi-
cant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
areas of functioning. Excessive health anxiety places a con-
siderable burden on the health care system, leading to need-
less medical consultations and unnecessary and potentially
harmful medical tests or procedures (APA, 2000; Taylor &
Asmund, 2004).
The concepts of hypochondriasis and health anxiety have
been replaced in the recent release of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;
APA, 2013) by two psychiatric disorders: illness anxiety dis-
order and somatic symptom disorder. Illness anxiety disorder
is the one that actually corresponds to the concept of health
anxiety and is characterized by excessive reassurance-seek-
ing, which is more likely associated with anxiety of already
having a disease, and related behaviors. Illness anxiety disor-
der is also characterized by avoidance of seeking health care,
which is more likely associated with anxiety about becoming
seriously ill in the future. Somatic symptom disorder resem-
bles the current and broad diagnostic concept of hypochon-
driasis (APA, 2013; Starcevic, 2013).
The present study is based on the interpersonal model of
health anxiety (IMHA; Noyes et al., 2003), which asserts
that health anxiety represents a maladaptive expression of
insecure attachment developed from adverse early caregiv-
ing childhood physical illness experiences through learning
(Alberts & Hadjistavropoulos, 2014; Stuart & Noyes, 1999).
According to attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1988) early
intimate relationships, usually with parents, influence one's
subsequent interactions and relationships with other people
(e.g., close friends, partners, physicians). Attachment styles
reflect the caregiver's ability to provide protection, comfort,
and a secure foundation for the child, especially during times
of threat and distress. Although both the conceptualization
and measurement of attachment style have varied across
studies, most investigators agree that two primary dimen-
sions are involved (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991;
Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998; Fraley & Shaver, 2000;
Fraley & Spieker, 2003). The first dimension, attachment
anxiety, concerns worries about rejection and abandonment;
the second dimension, attachment avoidance, concerns the
degree to which a person feels discomfort with closeness and
dependency, or a reluctance to be intimate with others. Low
scores on both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance
reflect a secure attachment style. High scores on both
dimensions, or high scores on one dimension and low scores
on the other, reflect an insecure attachment style. According
to Mikulincer and Shaver (2003), each insecure adult attach-
ment style is associated with a specific pattern of interper-
sonal behavior and emotion regulation when a person
perceives a threat, seeks proximity to an attachment figure,
and none is available or responsive. Individuals high on
attachment anxiety tend to use hyperactivating strategies,
characterized by a proximity-seeking effort to elicit support,
care, and attention. This strategy involves exaggerating the
presence and seriousness of threats and being highly vigilant
regarding internal indications of distress. Anxiously attached
individuals use methods of coping that consist of intensifica-
tion of negative emotions, mental rumination on related neg-
ative thoughts, self-criticism, negative self-image, and overt
displays of distress. Hyperactivating strategies may lead a
person to adopt a dependent and needy role that impairs the
formation of mature relationships and to feel chronically
frustrated because of the unfulfilled need for demonstrations
of interest and care. Others may take distance from the
demanding person as they feel abused by the person's end-
less demands for security and care. Regarding attachment
avoidance, individuals high on attachment avoidance tend to
use deactivating strategies, which involve denial of attach-
ment needs, avoidance of closeness and intimacy, inhibition
of the experience of distress, and an emphasis on self-reli-
ance and independence. Deactivating strategies lead to dis-
tancing coping, attempts to maintain interpersonal distance,
avoidance and suppression of negative emotional states, and
diversion of attention away from threat-related thoughts
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008). In summary, attachment
insecurity places individuals at risk for a variety of emo-
tional, cognitive, behavioral, and adjustment problems, and
has several negative implications for distress management,
support seeking, relationship quality, and the appraisal of the
self and others.
The IMHA proposes that health anxiety is a type of inter-
personal behavior that is motivated by insecure attachment,
whereby expressing persistent complaints of illness is used to
elicit support and care, and to seek reassurance from others
(Stuart & Noyes, 1999). It claims that health anxiety is main-
tained and exacerbated among insecurely attached individu-
als through a vicious maladaptive interpersonal cycle of
health-related reassurance-seeking, alienation, and worry.
This means that when health-anxious individuals are faced
with a perceived illness or somatic symptoms, they tend to
seek reassurance from others (e.g., family members or physi-
cians), in an effort to evoke comfort and a sense of security.
However, their extensive complaints about their health lead
others to perceive them as fragile, needy, and difficult to reas-
sure.As a result, excessive reassurance-seeking about somatic
complaints is met with reactions of negativity, distancing, and
alienation within interpersonal relations (Waldinger, Schulz,
Barsky, & Ahern, 2006). This sense of alienation from others,
coupled with health-anxious individuals' perception of
Anagnostopoulos and Botse 3
abandonment, and beliefs that others are unconcerned about
their health problems, may trigger more worry about health,
which leads again to the need for further reassurance-seeking.
Consequently, significant others' withdrawal of support, as
well as health-anxious individuals' belief that others do not
take their health complaints seriously, may be interpreted by
these insecurely attached individuals as evidence of rejection
or others' unavailability, which, in turn, may magnify attach-
ment insecurities. While the IMHA does not specify which
domain of insecure attachment is most relevant, it has been
found that anxious attachment may be more relevant to the
IMHA than avoidant attachment (Birnie et al., 2013). Yet,
others (e.g., Stuart & Noyes, 2005) maintain that health-anx-
ious individuals are characterized by insecure attachment,
typically avoidant (fearful or dismissing), or preoccupied in
nature. Birnie et al. (2013) tested the IMHA to check if direct
paths between anxious attachment, worry, alienation, and
reassurance-seeking existed. Results of their study showed
that, with the exception of anxious attachment and reassur-
ance-seeking, which were not significantly related to each
other, there were significant positive paths between anxious
attachment and worry, anxious attachment and alienation,
worry and reassurance-seeking, reassurance-seeking and
alienation, and alienation and worry.
Although our study is based on the IMHA, it proposes
various extensions to the IMHA, where the perceptual
dimension of health anxiety is added to the model, and links
are suggested between neuroticism and health anxiety dimen-
sions, as well as between health anxiety dimensions, medical
services utilization, and safety-seeking behaviors (Figure 1).
Regarding research hypotheses, first, based on the IMHA,
it was expected that health-related reassurance-seeking
would lead to health-related alienation, health-related alien-
ation would lead to health-related worry, and health-related
worry would lead to health-related reassurance-seeking.
Given that significant correlations have been found between
the perceptual dimension of health anxiety (absorption) and
the other three dimensions of it (Longley et al., 2010;
MacSwain et al., 2009; Stewart, Sherry, Watt, Grant, &
Hadjistavropoulos, 2008), the role of health-related absorp-
tion was also explored in this study. The addition of absorp-
tion to the proposed model was supported by previous
research results suggesting that health-anxious individuals
are more sensitive and intolerant of bodily sensations
(Barsky, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1990; Lee, Watson, & Frey
Law, 2010). Moreover, persons with elevated health anxiety
may automatically interpret and evaluate bodily symptom-
related information as being more dangerous than the others
see it, indicating an evaluation bias in these persons (Jasper
& Witthoft, 2013; Schmidt, Witthoft, Kornadt, Rist, & Bailer,
2013). This may lead to the assumption that absorption is a
key dimension in the model of health anxiety and can be used
as a starting point for the health anxiety process, given that
increased body vigilance can increase health-related worry
and may lead to an increased need of health-related
reassurance-seeking.
Second, as the IMHA proposes that insecure attachment
underlies health anxiety, but it does not specify which domain
of insecure attachment is more relevant, in this study we
explored the role of both anxious attachment and avoidant
attachment in health anxiety. It was expected that both inse-
cure attachment dimensions would be positively related to
the dimensions of health anxiety.
Third, neuroticism is a personality trait involving the ten-
dency to experience negative emotions and respond with
negative emotions to threat, frustration, and loss (Lahey,
2009). Eysenck and Eysenck (1975) described individuals
with high scores in neuroticism as "worriers," whose main
characteristic was a constant preoccupation with things that
might go wrong and a strong emotional reaction of anxiety
to those thoughts. Persons high in neuroticism tend to
express more somatic complaints because they interpret
bodily sensations as threats (Williams & Wiebe, 2000), and
make negative appraisals, overreact to stress, and are intro-
spective, all of which may contribute to health anxiety
(Pennebaker & Watson, 1991). As a result, based on prior
research (Longley et al., 2005; Noyes et al., 2003; Sherry
et al., 2014), neuroticism was expected to be related to
health anxiety dimensions.
Fourth, the relationship between health anxiety and health
care utilization was explored. People with health anxiety
often make use of health care resources in ways that are mal-
adaptive and costly for the health care system (APA, 2000;
Bobevski, Clarke, & Meadows, 2016; Ciechanowski, Walker,
Katon, & Russo, 2002). As Abramowitz, Schwartz, and
Whiteside (2002) claim, health services utilization repre-
sents a central way in which individuals with health anxiety

attempt to gain reassurance that they are medically healthy.
Thus, in our study, it was expected that health anxiety would
be related to health services utilization. Except from utilizing
medical services, to gain reassurance that they are healthy,
health-anxious individuals may engage in a variety of safety-
seeking behaviors, such as asking friends and family mem-
bers for their opinion about their health concerns, reviewing
medical literature, and checking their body for the presence
of any symptoms. These behaviors may include actions
designed to detect a perceived threat, to prevent harm, attain
certainty, and reduce anxiety. Thus, based on previous
research (Fergus & Valentiner, 2011; Olatunji, Etzel,
Tomarken, Ciesielski, & Deacon, 2011) it was expected that
health anxiety would be related to engagement in safety-
seeking behaviors. In this study, the relation between medi-
cal services utilization and safety-seeking behaviors was also
explored. It was expected that medical services utilization
would be related to safety-seeking behaviors, as health-anx-
ious individuals would first visit a specialist to be provided
with professional reassurance and then turn to close others or
the Internet hoping that they would be given reassurance.
Method
Participants
Questionnaire administration took place during November
and December 2013. The study's protocol was approved by
the research committee of the university. Questionnaires
were completed during lectures at the university lecture the-
aters, with the professors' permission. All participants in the
study were informed about the purpose of the study, were
told that participation was entirely voluntary, and were
assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of all data they
provided. Two hundred fifty questionnaires were adminis-
tered to university students, but 18 of them were not valid,
either because participants did not complete them or because
the answers given were not as per the instructions of each
questionnaire indicated. As a result, 232 undergraduate stu-
dents (92.8% response rate) from different Greek public
higher education institutions participated in our study, study-
ing in departments such as nursing, economics and business,
library science, psychology, dentistry, and electrical and
mechanical engineering. Given that our sample was non-
clinical, we excluded 36 cases who reported suffering cur-
rently from a serious mental or physical illness. Thus, the
final sample consisted of 196 young adults. Regarding the
gender of participants, 114 (58.2%) were women. The mean
age was 20.12 years (SD = 2.01; range = 18-29 years).
Measures
Attachment styles were measured by the Experiences in Close
Relationships Questionnaire­Revised (ECR-R; Fraley, Waller,
& Brennan, 2000). ECR-R is a 36-item self-report measure of
general attachment experiences in emotionally intimate rela-
tions. The ECR-R is composed of two 18-item subscales mea-
suring anxious attachment (e.g., "I'm afraid that I will lose my
partner's love") and avoidant attachment (e.g., "I prefer not to
show a partner how I feel deep down"). Items were rated on a
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
The Greek translation of ECR-R was made by Tsagarakis,
Kafetsios, and Stalikas (2007), and Cronbach's alpha coeffi-
cients for both subscales were equal to .91.
Health anxiety aspects and hypochondriacal traits
were measured by the Multidimensional Inventory of
Hypochondriacal Traits (MIHT; Longley et al., 2005). The
MIHT is a 31-item self-report measure of four dimensions of
health anxiety. Health-related reassurance-seeking (behav-
ioral factor) is measured with eight items (e.g., "I turn to oth-
ers for support when I do not feel well"), health-related
alienation (interpersonal factor) is measured with seven items
(e.g., "Few people take my health concerns as seriously as I
do"), health-related absorption (perceptual factor) with nine
items (e.g., "I am aware of physical sensations"), and health-
related worry (affective factor) with seven items (e.g.,
"Reading articles about disease makes me worry about my
health"). It should be noted that health-related alienation did
not actually reflect cognitive aspects of health anxiety, but
rather interpersonal ones (e.g., "Sometimes others do not
seem very concerned about my health complaints"; "The
more I talk about my health problems, the less others seem to
listen"). MIHT items were rated on a scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Cronbach's alpha
coefficients for the MIHT subscales have been reported to be
.75 (Longley et al., 2005).
Health care utilization and safety-seeking behaviors
were measured by the Medical Utilization Questionnaire
(MUQ; Abramowitz, Deacon, & Valentiner, 2007). The
MUQ assesses two domains of health-related behaviors
associated with health anxiety. The MUQ initially inquires
about the utilization of 20 medical services or practitioners
(e.g., inpatient hospital stay, dermatologist, cardiologist)
over the past 6 months, and if the service has been used, par-
ticipants provide the number of times they have used the ser-
vice during that period. Total scores are calculated by
summing the number of visits across all providers seen. Then
the MUQ asks participants to rate the frequency with which
they have engaged in 10 different safety-seeking behaviors
(e.g., checked your pulse, accessed health material on the
Internet) out of concern for their physical health during the
past month. Responses to these items are provided on a
5-point scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (all the time).
Scores on all items are summed to yield a total score.
Neuroticism was measured by Eysenck Personality
Questionnaire­Neuroticism Scale (EPQ; Eysenck, 1947;
Eysenck, & Eysenck, 1968). The EPQ is a questionnaire
assessing personality traits and consists of four dimensions:
extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie. Answers
are given on a yes/no scale. The EPQ has been translated into
Anagnostopoulos and Botse 5
Greek by Papapetrou (1998). In the present study, only the
neuroticism scale was used, which consisted of 22 questions
(e.g., "Does your mood often go up and down?").
Procedure
Given that no official Greek translation existed regarding the
MUQ and MIHT, the forward-backward translation proce-
dure was applied to translate and culturally adapt the
English-language version of these instruments into the Greek
language. The instruments were first translated from English
into Greek by two independent professionals; these transla-
tions were compared and a single translated scale was cre-
ated through consensus. The scales were then back translated
from Greek into English by two other independent profes-
sionals. The back-translated versions were compared with
the original scales to identify discrepancies. Next the Greek
version was administered to 20 randomly selected students.
Ten students were also interviewed by the authors using a
cognitive debriefing process to ensure the linguistic, seman-
tic, and conceptual equivalence between the two scales.After
this process, the final measures were prepared for adminis-
tration in a larger survey study.
Statistical Analyses
To assess whether significant paths among variables were
present in the theoretical model, the significance of the
effects of the independent variables (i.e., neuroticism, anx-
ious and avoidant attachment) on the dependent variables
(i.e., safety-seeking behaviors) transmitted through multiple
mediators (i.e., health anxiety dimensions), was tested using
path analysis with observed variables. The bias-corrected
bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for direct, indirect, and
total effects were estimated. Bootstrapping is a non-paramet-
ric resampling method that can be extended to designs
involving effects. In the case of simple mediation, indirect
effects equal the product of two unstandardized regression
coefficients, one representing the effect of the independent
variable on the proposed mediator, and the other representing
the effect of the mediator on the dependent variable, control-
ling for the impact of the independent variable (Frazier, Tix,
& Barron, 2004). However, using the product of regression
coefficients for making inferences about indirect effects
involves implicit assumption that the sampling distribution
of the indirect effect is normal. There are reasons to suspect
that this assumption does not hold when mediation is present
(Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Thus, bootstrapping has been rec-
ommended (MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004). To
bootstrap the sampling distribution of the indirect effects, the
regression coefficients are repeatedly estimated k times with
bootstrap samples, each of which contains n cases randomly
sampled with replacement from the original sample (i.e., a
given case can be selected multiple times), where n is the
size of the original sample. This process yields k estimates of
the indirect effects of the independent variable on the depen-
dent variable. These k values of the indirect effects are then
sorted from low to high, thus enabling the specification of
the lower and upper bounds of the desired CI. Bootstrapping
was conducted using Analysis of Moment Structures
(AMOS) v. 21 (Arbuckle, 2012), generating 2,000 bootstrap
samples and 95% bias-corrected CIs for total, direct, and
indirect effects. Given that a significant indirect effect might
be detected even when the direct or total effect was not sta-
tistically significant (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty,
2011), the direct, total, and specific indirect effects were
tested separately, the latter being tested using Mplus v. 6.12
(Muthen & Muthen, 2010). Correlation matrices of continu-
ous variables were used as input, and estimates were derived
applying the maximum likelihood method. In case of multi-
variate non-normality, the Bollen-Stine bootstrapping
approach to model testing and overall model fit assessment
was implemented to derive and determine a corrected p
value. By drawing a large number of bootstrap samples and
constructing an empirical sampling distribution for bootstrap
test statistic values, the Bollen-Stine p value represented the
proportion of bootstrap samples whose model test statistic
(chi-square) exceeded the parent sample's maximum likeli-
hood test statistic (chi-square) value, signifying that for these
samples the model fit was worse than expected. Five indices
were used to assess goodness of fit of the model: the root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) accompanied
by its associated 90% CI, the standardized root mean square
residual (SRMR), the comparative fit index (CFI), the
goodness-of-fit index (GFI), and the Tucker­Lewis index
(TLI). Model fit was considered adequate when CFI and GFI
were greater than .95, TLI was greater than .95, SRMR was
lower than .08, and RMSEA was lower than .06 (Hu &
Bentler, 1999). Improvements to model fit were indicated by
a decrease in the model Akaike information criterion (AIC; a
modification of the standard goodness-of-fit chi-square sta-
tistic that adjusts for the complexity of the model), the model
Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and the model consis-
tent AIC (CAIC) that takes sample size into account.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Nearly half of the participants (49.1%) reported having a
very good health, while 21.9% reported an excellent health
status, and 26% reported a good health. Regarding internal
consistency reliability of questionnaire scales, Cronbach's
alpha coefficients were acceptable for all subscales (ranging
from .700 to .871). Table 1 illustrates descriptive statistics
and the correlations between main psychological variables.
Neuroticism was highly significantly and positively related
to anxious attachment, absorption, alienation, worry, and
reassurance-seeking. Anxious attachment was highly signifi-
cantly and positively associated with alienation, worry, and
6 SAGE Open
reassurance-seeking. Avoidant attachment was highly sig-
nificantly and negatively associated with absorption and
reassurance-seeking, whereas it was positively related to
alienation. More frequent utilization of medical services was
highly significantly and positively related to anxious attach-
ment and alienation, while more frequent exhibition of
safety-seeking behaviors was highly significantly and posi-
tively associated with alienation and worry.
Path Analysis
Initially, all paths from the independent variables (e.g., anx-
ious and avoidant attachment, neuroticism) to the dependent
variables (e.g., safety-seeking behaviors) passing through
the mediators (e.g., health anxiety dimensions) were esti-
mated. Bootstrapping was conducted generating 2,000 usable
bootstrap samples and 95% bias-corrected CIs for direct,
indirect, and total effects. The model had a good fit to the
data, with 2/df = 8.583/7 = 1.226, p = .284, CFI = .995,
RMSEA = .034 (90% CI = [.000, .099]), SRMR = .027, TLI
= .973, GFI = .990. Degree of parsimony model fit indices
includedAIC = 84.583, BIC = 209.151, and CAIC = 247.151.
Tests of normality indicated significant degree of non-
normality (critical ratio value for joint multivariate kurtosis
= 8.075). Thus, the Bollen-Stine p value was obtained to
assess model fit. This p value was equal to .451, which indi-
cated that the model fitted the data well, using a conventional
significance level of .05. However, the key to path analysis
and the model-building process was finding an approxima-
tion to the saturated model (i.e., a model with zero degrees of
freedom and a perfect fit to the data), with fewer parameters
to be estimated. Given that various paths appeared to corre-
spond to non-significant relationships, we re-estimated the
model retaining only the significant paths from the previous
model. The new, trimmed, model (Figure 2) included the
same set of variables and had no significant worsening of
fit, compared with the initial model, with 2(16) = 20.409,
p = .202, 2(9) = 11.826, p = .223. On the basis of overall
fit indices that could take into account both model fit and model
complexity­parsimony, this trimmed model had lower AIC,
BIC, and CAIC values (equal to 78.409, 173.475, and 202.475,
respectively), indicating a better fit to the data than the initial
model. The variables included in path analysis (e.g., anxious
attachment, avoidant attachment, neuroticism) accounted for a
large proportion of variance in reassurance-seeking (39.5%)
and worry (33.4%), and for a lesser proportion of variance in
absorption (17.5%), alienation (16.9%), medical services utili-
zation (12.8%), and safety-seeking behavior (4.0%).
Direct effects in path analysis. As can be seen in Figure 2, the
majority of the standardized regression coefficients pertain-
ing to the paths from anxious and avoidant attachment to
health anxiety dimensions were found statistically signifi-
cant. In particular, both anxious and avoidant attachment
were significantly related to absorption (perceptual dimen-
sion) and alienation (interpersonal dimension), but they were
not significantly related to worry (affective dimension),
while only avoidant attachment was negatively and signifi-
cantly associated with reassurance-seeking (behavioral
dimension). All standardized regression coefficients of the
paths from neuroticism to health anxiety dimensions were
found significant at the .05 level (Table 2). In particular, neu-
roticism was positively related to absorption, reassurance-
seeking, worry, and alienation.
Among the paths leading from health anxiety dimensions
to medical services utilization, only two were found statisti-
cally significant. In particular, both absorption and alienation
were related to medical services utilization, but reassurance-
seeking and worry were not significantly related to medical
services utilization. The path from anxious attachment to
medical services utilization was found to be positive and sig-
nificant. Among the paths leading from health anxiety
dimensions to safety-seeking behaviors, none of them was
found statistically significant. On the contrary, medical

services utilization was positively and significantly associ-
ated with safety-seeking behaviors.
Regarding the relationships between the health anxiety
dimensions, absorption was positively related to reassur-
ance-seeking and worry, worry was positively related to
reassurance-seeking, alienation was positively related to
worry, but reassurance-seeking was not significantly related
to alienation ( = .087, SE = .091, p = .350).
Indirect effects in mediation analysis. To assess whether media-
tion was present in the model, the significance of the indirect
effects was tested using the bias-corrected bootstrap CIs. As
shown in Table 3 regarding total indirect (mediated) effects
as well as two-path and three-path standardized specific indi-
rect effects, neuroticism and anxious attachment were sig-
nificantly associated with reassurance-seeking through
worry, while they were significantly associated with worry
through absorption or alienation. Anxious attachment was
also related to safety-seeking behaviors through medical
services utilization. Avoidant attachment was associated
with reassurance-seeking and medical services utilization via
absorption. In addition, absorption was significantly associ-
ated with reassurance-seeking through worry and alienation
was significantly associated with reassurance-seeking
through worry, while alienation and absorption were signifi-
cantly associated with safety-seeking behaviors through
medical services utilization.
Total effects in mediation analysis. Regarding significant and
noteworthy standardized total effects, avoidant attachment
was positively associated with medical services utilization
and safety-seeking behaviors, whereas it was negatively
related to absorption and reassurance-seeking. Neuroticism
was positively related to safety-seeking behaviors, alien-
ation, and worry (Table 2). Moreover, alienation was posi-
tively related to reassurance-seeking ( = .126, 95% CI =
[.062, .210], p < .001), medical services utilization ( = .161,
95% CI = [.025, .296], p = .022), and safety-seeking

behaviors ( = .032, 95% CI = [.003, .089], p = .016). In
addition, absorption was negatively related to medical ser-
vices utilization ( = -.166, 95% CI = [-.310, -.012], p =
.035), and safety-seeking behaviors ( = -.033, 95% CI =

Discussion
The present study tested an extended IMHA model and links
between health anxiety dimensions, neuroticism, anxious
and avoidant attachment, medical services utilization, and
safety-seeking behaviors. Results provided partial support
for the model. Specifically, insecure attachment (i.e., anxious
and avoidant attachment) appeared to be directly related to
two (i.e., alienation and absorption) of the four dimensions
included in health anxiety. The positive link between anxious
and avoidant attachment and alienation may be due to the
fact that insecurely attached individuals with a fear of aban-
donment and rejection may focus more on the fact that others
seem unconcerned about their health, do not take their health
concerns seriously, and react with negativity and distancing
(Longley et al., 2005). Our finding that anxious attachment
was positively related to absorption and alienation was not
unexpected, given anxious persons' exaggerated threat
appraisal, clinginess, neediness, and dependency. Moreover,
our findings that avoidant attachment was negatively related
to reassurance-seeking and absorption, and positively related
to alienation, were not unexpected. Avoidant individuals
exhibit heightened reliance on distancing coping, heightened
perceptions of self-efficacy, blockage in the activation of the
caregiving system, and exclusion of threat-related cognitions
from awareness. These findings are consistent with that of
previous research. Birnie et al. (2013) have found negative
correlations between avoidant attachment and health-related
reassurance-seeking, as well as no significant correlations
between avoidant attachment and health-related worry.
Jordan, Williams, and Smith (2015) have also found that
avoidant attachment is negatively associated with reassur-
ance-seeking. To further elaborate on this issue, the inverse
association found in our study between avoidant attachment
and reassurance-seeking and absorption might imply that
avoidant attachment could be a protective factor for health
anxiety. However, if we closely examine the total indirect
effects of avoidant attachment on medical services utiliza-
tion and safety-seeking behaviors, we can notice that these
are significant and positive. Thus, higher scores on avoidant
attachment are related to increased engagement in safety-
seeking behaviors. In this regard, excessive engagement in
safety behaviors is associated with increases in health anxi-
ety and may exacerbate health anxiety by transmitting illness
threat information and by leading individuals to infer the
presence of danger and maintain strong disease convictions
(Olatunji et al., 2011). In addition, avoidantly attached indi-
viduals have been found to exhibit a heightened physiologi-
cal activation to emotional stimuli, although they keep
control of their explicit behavior, and tend to avert attention
from emotional information (Silva, Ferreira, Soares, &
Esteves, 2015). By using deactivating strategies, they leave
the suppressed distress unresolved; but the distress can still
be indirectly manifested in somatic symptoms. In this way,

avoidant persons may react to stressful stimuli with somatic
complaints, leading them to engage in safety behaviors.
Contrary to what was expected, insecure attachment (anx-
ious or avoidant attachment) was not directly related to
worry. A study by Sherry et al. (2014) showed that anxious
attachment was significantly related to hypochondriacal
worry, but avoidant attachment was not. Reiser (2013) found
that anxious attachment was not predictive of health anxiety,
when additional variables (e.g., childhood abuse, emotion
regulation, depression, anxiety sensitivity) were simultane-
ously included in regression models. It seems that anxious or
avoidant attachment may demonstrate less influence on cer-
tain health anxiety dimensions in the presence of additional
variables (e.g., neuroticism).
Neuroticism was positively related to all four health anxi-
ety dimensions. Based on our findings, it seems that neuroti-
cism exerts its effects within the framework provided by the
MIHT dimensions, while its effects are not extended to
safety behaviors or medical services utilization. Individuals
with high levels of neuroticism overreact to stress, respond
with negative emotions to stress, and make negative apprais-
als (Pennebaker & Watson, 1991). This may contribute to

increased health anxiety levels, as these individuals tend to
spot possible threats for their health even if they are not pres-
ent (increased absorption). Moreover, they tend to believe
that others are unconcerned about their health, hence worry
more about their health, and seek reassurance to alleviate
their worry. These findings confirm results of previous
research (Longley et al., 2005).
Concerning the paths among the four health anxiety
dimensions, results showed that, as expected (Jordan et al.,
2015), worry was related to reassurance-seeking, while
alienation was associated with worry. Contrary to what was
hypothesized based on the IMHA, reassurance-seeking did
not lead to alienation. This inconsistency may be due to the
fact that the items used to measure reassurance-seeking
reflect a more passive desire for health-related reassurance-
seeking, which stands in contrast to the active, incessant, and
aversive reassurance-seeking, as it is conceptualized by the
IMHA and other theories (Puri & Dimsdale, 2011). Taking
account of the perceptual factor (absorption) in our analysis,
results showed that absorption was positively related to
worry and reassurance-seeking. One's tendency to focus on
one's bodily symptoms may lead a health-anxious individual
to experience worry about one's perceived health problems
and engage in reassurance-seeking behaviors, while absorp-
tion can function as a starting point for the health anxiety
process. Significant indirect paths were also found between
absorption and reassurance-seeking through worry, and
between alienation and reassurance-seeking through worry.
These significant indirect paths may indicate that health anx-
iety dimensions are strongly linked with one another, and
that health-related worry (i.e., the affective dimension of
health anxiety) may play a major role in holding together the
other three components of health anxiety. It seems that worry
can act as a significant factor that mediates the effects of
alienation and absorption (but also the effects of anxious and
avoidant attachment and neuroticism) on reassurance-seek-
ing. The effects exerted by worry are limited within the
framework provided by the MIHT dimensions and are not
extended to medical services utilization or safety behaviors.
Medical services utilization was found to be related to
absorption and alienation, the latter finding being consistent
with that reported by Longley et al. (2005) that the cognitive/
interpersonal dimension of health anxiety was related to the
number of both clinic appointments and clinics attended.
Medical services utilization represents a central way in
which individuals with high levels of anxious attachment
attempt to gain reassurance that they are medically healthy
(Abramowitz et al., 2002; Fergus & Valentiner, 2011). This
finding may suggest that the interpersonal manifestations of
health anxiety are most salient to increased medical services
utilization. It was also found that medical services utilization
led to safety-seeking behaviors. This may be due to the fact
that, by engaging in safety-seeking behaviors, health-anx-
ious individuals hope that they will verify what doctors told
them. It should be noted that repetitive safety-seeking
behaviors (e.g., checking Internet for information about
health-related material, discussing one's health with friends,
checking one's body for potential signs of illness) may not be
adaptive. These behaviors can generate much distress only in
individuals characterized by higher levels of health anxiety,
compared with that in individuals with lower levels of health
anxiety. Finally, medical services utilization was found to be
directly and positively related to anxious attachment, a find-
ing that is consistent with previous research showing signifi-
cant associations between insecure attachment and frequent
general practitioner attendance (Taylor, Marshall, Mann, &
Goldberg, 2012).
All in all, the extended IMHA confirms that health anxi-
ety is mainly affected by neuroticism (and secondary by anx-
ious and avoidant attachment), and that the interpersonal
dimension of health anxiety (alienation), together with the
perceptual dimension of it (absorption), coupled with high
levels of anxious and avoidant attachment may lead individ-
uals to medical services utilization, which can result in
engagement in safety-seeking behaviors. Anxious and avoid-
ant attachment may exert their effects on medical services
utilization and safety behaviors through different mecha-
nisms. Based on total effects, while anxious attachment is
positively related to safety-seeking behaviors via medical
services utilization, avoidant attachment is positively related
to medical services utilization through absorption. These
findings may suggest potential refinements in the IMHA.
Study Limitations
While there are strengths to the current study (e.g., inclusion
of additional variables in the IMHA, examination of poten-
tial mediating factors in the relationship between insecure
attachment, health anxiety dimensions, and safety-seeking
behaviors), there are also a number of potential study limita-
tions to consider. First, only self-report questionnaires were
used. Due to this, answers might not reflect the reality of
participants' health condition as some participants might
lack insight into their own beliefs, feelings, or behaviors,
leading to inaccurate or biased presentation of their function-
ing (Ganellen, 2007). Moreover, observed correlations
between measures might be inflated or deflated due to com-
mon method bias in self-report data, representing variance
attributable to the measurement method used rather than to
the constructs being measured (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee,
& Podsakoff, 2003). Data obtained from multiple sources
and methods might offer a more objective view of health
anxiety, attachment, neuroticism, medical services utiliza-
tion, and safety-seeking behaviors. Second, generalizability
of our findings from a non-clinical student sample to the gen-
eral population or to clinical samples is probably limited. As
our study was carried out with young university students in
good health, the results are restricted to the subclinical phe-
nomenon of elevated health anxiety and cannot necessarily
be generalized to the full clinical picture of hypochondriasis.
Anagnostopoulos and Botse 11
Future studies could investigate the extended IMHA across
other subpopulations, with a wider range and degree of vari-
ability in health anxiety severity (e.g., community, primary
health care, psychiatric), physical health problems, age, and
education. Third, we tested our model using a cross-sectional
study design. Thus, assumptions about path directionality
and temporal precedence cannot be made. Future studies
using the IMHA should employ a longitudinal design.
Finally, while the current study was based on the IMHA, the
investigation is limited in the extension to other models of
health anxiety. Future studies should examine the relation-
ships between health anxiety and safety behaviors (e.g.,
repeated medical consultations and tests, self-checking of
one's body, compulsive requests for reassurance and repeated
searches for reassuring information) in the context of the
cognitive-behavioral model (Olatunji et al., 2014; Rachman,
2012; Salkovskis & Warwick, 2001a, 2001b) for a more
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that under-
lie, trigger, and maintain health anxiety.
Practical Implications
As our study is based on an IMHA, we can discuss an inter-
personal perspective on the treatment of health anxiety. As
interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on how problems in
interpersonal relations predispose, precipitate, and perpetu-
ate a patient's distress (Weissman, Markowitz, & Klerman,
2000), it is plausible to assume that it can be helpful for per-
sons with health anxiety. Interpersonal therapy is a validated
treatment for a variety of disorders, such as affective disor-
ders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. Its targets con-
sist of symptom relief, improved interpersonal functioning,
and increased social support (Robertson, Rushton, & Wurm,
2008; Stuart, 2014), using techniques such as role-playing,
communication analysis, and examination of interpersonal
incidents involving care-seeking behaviors that occur in
daily communications, and reinforcement of communication
change. Interpersonal therapy would focus on insecure
attachment and the interpersonal aspects of health anxiety,
such as alienation and reassurance-seeking behaviors, which
actually occur within an interpersonal context. Through
interpersonal mechanisms, health-anxious individuals can
communicate their emotional needs and seek interpersonal
support from others to relieve psychological distress (Alberts
& Hadjistavropoulos, 2014). By teaching health-anxious
individuals (via interpersonal therapy) how to develop close,
intimate, relationships with others and communicate more
effectively with others, individuals will be assisted in obtain-
ing care more efficiently, reducing their psychological dis-
tress (Stuart & Noyes, 2005). This can be achieved, first, by
addressing maladaptive patterns of communication (that can
lead such individuals to feel misunderstood, isolated,
rejected, and unable to communicate that suffering effec-
tively) and then by modifying them. In this way, their sense
of alienation and their belief that they are uncared-for
persons, and that others are unconcerned with their health
problems, will be diminished. Based on our results that indi-
cate that alienation may lead to worry, if health-anxious per-
sons' sense of alienation is reduced, the same will happen to
their health-related worry levels and, consequently, to their
persistent and compelling reassurance-seeking behavior.
Unfortunately, the majority of studies on interpersonal ther-
apy have focused on the treatment of depression (Markowitz
& Weissman, 2004) and somatoform disorders (Stuart,
Noyes, Starcevic, & Barsky, 2008). Clearly, further research
is needed to investigate the efficacy of interpersonal psycho-
therapy in the treatment of health anxiety.
Conclusion
This study gives an alternative view of health anxiety as our
results highlight the importance of insecure attachment (i.e.,
anxious and avoidant attachment) both in health anxiety
(specifically, absorption and alienation) and in engagement
in safety-seeking behaviors. Also, when absorption is added
to the model of health anxiety, results show significant links
between this health anxiety dimension and worry and reas-
surance-seeking. This indicates that the addition of this
dimension to the model provides us a wider perspective on
health anxiety. What is more, results show that neuroticism
may play a key role in health-anxious individuals. Finally,
this study shows that health-related worry may play a cen-
tral role in the health anxiety process and that absorption
(the tendency to focus on bodily sensations) and dysfunc-
tional interpersonal relationships (denoted by alienation)
may initiate the vicious maladaptive cycle maintaining
health anxiety. These findings may be used to refine
extended models and clinical practice developments in the
area of health anxiety.
