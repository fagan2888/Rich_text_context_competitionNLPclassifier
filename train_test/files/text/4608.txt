Abstract
Objectives: To assess the association between polymorphism in the interleukin (IL)-10 promoter
region of 1082 G/A and the risk of cervical cancer and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN),
using meta-analysis.
Methods: The electronic literature databases PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ, Web of Science, CBMdisc and
CNKI were searched for relevant studies. The strength of association between IL-10
gene À1082 G/A polymorphism and cervical cancer and/or CIN was measured using pooled
odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals in four genetic models: allelic model (A allele versus G
allele); additive model (A/A versus G/G); recessive model (A/A versus G/AþG/G); dominant model
(A/AþG/A versus G/G).
Results: Eight studies involving 1983 cases and 1618 controls were identified and included in the
meta-analysis. No significant associations were found between IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorph-
ism and cervical cancer and/or CIN in any of the genetic models.
Conclusions: IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorphism does not appear to be associated with the
risk of cervical cancer and/or CIN.

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the second most common
malignant tumour among women and is
thought to arise as the result of a combin-
ation of host and environmental factors.1
Persistent infection with high-risk human
papilloma virus (HPV) plays a key role in
the development and progression of cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can
develop into squamous cell carcinoma of the
cervix.2 It is likely that host genetic differ-
ences influencing the response to viral infec-
tion may determine the risk of developing
cervical lesions and progression to invasive
carcinoma, suggesting that polymorphisms
present in genes related to viral infection,
immune response or DNA repair systems or
in tumour suppressor genes may influence
the risk of developing cervical cancer.3
Interleukin (IL)-10, a multifunctional
cytokine, plays a key role in the inflamma-
tory response associated with the progres-
sion of HPV infection and neoplasia or
cancer formation.4 Studies have reported
that polymorphism in the IL-10 promoter
region of ­1082 G/A is associated with IL-10
gene transcription and secretion.5 A number
of epidemiological studies have focused on
the association between IL-10 gene ­1082 G/
A polymorphism and the risk of cervical
cancer and/or CIN. However, the findings
have been inconsistent. The present meta-
analysis was designed to give a more precise
estimation of the strength of this
association.
Materials and methods
Identification of studies
This meta-analysis followed the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and
meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria.6 Eligible
studies published up to 2 December 2013
were identified by searching the electronic
literature databases PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ,
Web of Science, CBMdisc and CNKI.
The following keywords and search strate-
gies were used: (``interleukin-10'' OR ``IL-
10'') AND (``polymorphism'' OR ``muta-
tion'' OR ``variant'' OR ``genotype'') AND
(``cervical cancer'' OR ``cervical intraepithe-
lial neoplasia'' OR ``CIN''). In addition,
reference lists of reviews or original articles
analysing the association between IL-10
gene À1082 G/A polymorphism and cervical
cancer and/or CIN were also searched, to
identify additional relevant articles. No lan-
guage restrictions were set in this meta-
analysis.
Inclusion criteria
To be included, studies had to meet all of the
following criteria: (i) human studies;
(ii) studies on the relationships between IL-
10 gene ­1082 G/A polymorphism and cer-
vical cancer and/or CIN; (iii) unrelated case­
control studies; (iv) genotype frequency
details provided; (v) not republished data.
Data extraction
Data were extracted from eligible studies by
two authors (S. Z. and Y.W.Y.) independ-
ently in duplicate, using a standard data
collection form. The results were reviewed
by a third author (Y-L.K.). The following
information was collected from each study:
last name of the first author; publication
year; ethnicities and countries of partici-
pants; source of controls; number of cases
and controls; genotype and allele data; the
result of Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) testing in the control group
(P < 0.05 was considered to be a significant
deviation from the HWE).
Meta-analysis
The strength of associations between IL-10
gene À1082 G/A polymorphism and cervical
cancer and/or CIN were measured using
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
1194 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
intervals (CIs). Pooled ORs were combined
for the allelic model (A allele versus G
allele), the additive model (A/A versus G/
G), the recessive model (A/A versus
G/AþG/G) and the dominant model (A/
AþG/A versus G/G). Between-study het-
erogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q
statistic and the I2 statistic, with a
Pheterogeneity
< 0.1 or I2 > 50% indicating
the existence of heterogeneity.7,8 If
between-study heterogeneity existed, the
random-effects model was used to calculate
the pooled ORs; otherwise the fixed-effects
model was used.9,10
Subgroup analysis was performed, based
on ethnicity. In addition, sensitivity analysis
was conducted to confirm the reliability of
combined analyses (based on studies show-
ing HWE only). Publication bias was
assessed using Begg's funnel plot and
Egger's regression test (P < 0.05 was con-
sidered to be representative of statistically
significant publication bias).11 All statistical
analyses were performed using STATAÕ
software version 11.0 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Characteristics of eligible studies
The study selection process is shown in
Figure 1. In total, eight articles containing
a total of 1983 cases and 1618 controls were
identified that met the inclusion criteria.12­19
Three studies were performed in Europeans,
four in Asians, and one in Africans.
Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity was
performed for Asians and non-Asians. The
genotype distributions among the controls
of all studies followed the HWE except for

main characteristics are given in Table 1.
Quantitative synthesis
Combined analyses for relationships
between IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorph-
ism and cervical cancer and/or CIN are
shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Significant
heterogeneity existed in the allelic model
(Pheterogeneity
< 0.001, I2 ¼ 76.6%) and dom-
inant model (Pheterogeneity
< 0.001,
I2 ¼ 76.6%); therefore, the random-effects
model was used to synthesize these data. No
heterogeneity was found in the additive
model (Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.416, I2 ¼ 1.1%) and
recessive model (Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.734,
I2 ¼ 0%), so the fixed-effects model was
used to analyse these data. Overall, there
were no significant associations between
IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorphism and
cervical cancer and/or CIN in any of the
genetic models (Table 2). When analysed by
ethnicity, there were again no significant
associations between IL-10 gene À1082 G/A
polymorphism and cervical cancer and/or
CIN in either Asians or non-Asians
(Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was performed to evalu-
ate the stability of the overall results. When
the study of Yu et al.,17 which was the only
study that did not meet the HWE, was
excluded, the corresponding pooled ORs
were not materially altered in any of the
genetic models (Table 2), suggesting that the
results of the meta-analysis were stable and
that the study without HWE was not
influencing the overall results.
Publication bias
There was no evidence of publication bias
using Begg's funnel plots (Figure 3). In
addition, there was no statistical evidence
of publication bias among studies using
Egger's regression test (P ! 0.05 for all four
genetic models).
Discussion
The associations between IL-10 gene
À1082 G/A polymorphism and cervical
cancer and/or CIN have been intensively
studied, but the results have been inconsist-
ent. For example, in 2001, Stanczuk et al.18
found that, compared with the IL-10 A
allele, the IL-10 G allele was associated
with a significantly higher risk for develop-
ing cervical cancer in Zimbabwean popula-
tions. In 2010, Matsumoto et al.15 also
resported that the IL-10 G allele was asso-
ciated with a higher cervical cancer risk in
Japanese populations compared with the
IL-10 A allele. However, Roh et al.,16
Zoodsma et al.,19 Farzaneh et al.,12 Wang
et al.14 and Yu et al.,17 and Barbisan et al.13
found that the IL-10 gene À1082 G/A poly-
morphism was not associated with cervical
cancer or CIN in Korean, Dutch, British,
Chinese and Argentinean populations,
respectively. The present meta-analysis of
data from eight eligible studies, including
1983 cases and 1618 controls, was therefore
performed to derive a more precise estimate
of the strength of the association.
In the present meta-analysis, IL-10
gene À1082 G/A polymorphism and its rela-
tionship with the risk of cervical cancer and/
or CIN was examined using four genetic
models. Overall, no significant association
was found in any of the genetic models.
These findings are consistent with most of
the studies in our meta-analysis.12­14,16,17,19
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that
there were no significant associations
between IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorph-
ism and cervical cancer and/or CIN in
Asians or non-Asians. Because the inclusion
of studies without HWE might influence the
results of the meta-analysis,20 a sensitivity
analysis restricted to the studies with HWE

was performed. Similar results to those of
the full meta-analysis were found. Thus, the
results of subgroup and sensitivity analyses
further strengthened the finding that IL-10
gene polymorphism is not associated with
cervical cancer and/or CIN.
Significant between-study heterogeneity
existed in the allelic and dominant models.
Heterogeneity is a potential problem that
may affect the interpretation of the results. It
has a wide range of potential sources, such
as case definition and sampling, sample
sizes, methods of genotyping, and differ-
ences in ethnicity. The subgroup and sensi-
tivity analyses performed were unable to
identify the sources of heterogeneity.
Further analyses were not performed due
to the lack of original data. Therefore, all
the potential reasons for heterogeneity
should still be taken into account.
Publication bias did not exist in the overall
comparisons, indicating that the results of
the present meta-analysis were statistically
robust. However, certain limitations of this
work should be acknowledged. First, the
sample size in most of the included studies
was small, which could increase the prob-
ability of false positives or false negatives.
Secondly, significant between-study hetero-
geneity existed in the allelic and dominant
models, indicating that the findings should be
interpreted with care. Thirdly, cervical
cancer and CIN are complex diseases that
can be affected by a number of factors such as
HPV infection, HPV subtype, infectious
state, the balance of pro- and anti-inflamma-
tory cytokines, and other conditions that
influence cytokine levels. However, many of
the eligible studies included in this meta-
analysis did not present sufficient original

data related to these factors to allow further
subgroup analyses. In addition, meta-
analyses have some inherent limitations in
that their retrospective nature, meaning that
they are subject to the methodological defi-
ciencies of the included studies.
Despite these limitations, the present
meta-analysis had some strengths. First,
the process of meta-analysis has the ability
to detect small effects in human genetic
association studies.21 In the present study,
data were extracted from as many different
studies as possible, which increased the
statistical power of this analysis. Secondly,
the corresponding pooled ORs were not
materially altered in any of the genetic
models when subgroup and sensitivity ana-
lyses were performed, and no publication
bias was found, indicating that the results of
this meta-analysis were stable and reliable.
In conclusion, findings of the present
study suggest that there is no association
between IL-10 gene À1082 G/A polymorph-
ism and cervical cancer and/or CIN.
However, this result should be interpreted
with caution because of the limitations of
this meta-analysis. Further studies with
larger sample sizes, especially multicentric
case­control studies, will be needed to con-
firm these findings.
