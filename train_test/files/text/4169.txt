Abstract
Objective: A retrospective study to compare surgical parameters and postoperative pain in
patients undergoing coblation tonsillectomy with or without microscopic guidance.
Methods: Data regarding duration of surgery and hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss,
incidence of haemorrhage and postoperative pain scores were retrieved from the medical records
of adult patients undergoing coblation tonsillectomy under direct vision or with microscopic
guidance.
Results: The incidence of secondary haemorrhage (>24 h postoperatively) was significantly lower
and the duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the microscope group (n ¼ 92) than the
direct vision group (n ¼ 76). Pain scores both at rest and while swallowing reached 3 (no
significant impact on quality-of-life) significantly faster in the microscope group than the direct
vision group.
Conclusions: Microscope-assisted coblation tonsillectomy decreases the duration of hospital stay
and the incidence of postoperative secondary haemorrhage, and results in an early improvement in
postoperative pain scores.

Introduction
Tonsillectomy is a common surgery that was
first performed 3000 years ago.1 Cooling
instruments are frequently used to minimize
heat-induced tissue damage during conven-
tional tonsillectomy by dissection; newer
technologies include electric knives, lasers,
harmonic scalpels, coblation, and microdeb-
rider tonsillectomy.2­6 Coblation tonsillec-
tomy has been studied worldwide and is

generally used by otolaryngologists in China
because it causes little tissue damage.7­9
Tonsillectomy is a relatively minor sur-
gery, and is generally performed by direct
vision in order to complete the procedure
quickly and decrease patient discomfort
caused by the use of multiple pieces of
equipment during surgery. The small and
narrow surgical field makes visualization of
the lower pole of the tonsil difficult, how-
ever. In addition, only the surgeon can view
the surgical process, thereby excluding the
assistant. Attempts to perform tonsillec-
tomy using an endoscope have been
reported, but the endoscopic surgical field
is not three-dimensional.10
We have performed coblation tonsillec-
tomy using a surgical microscope. On the
basis of our experience, we hypothesized that
the surgical microscope allows for minimally
invasive tonsillectomy with less damage and
intraoperative blood loss, and a more radical
resection than conventional tonsillectomy.
The present retrospective study compared
the surgical duration, intraoperative blood
loss, incidence of haemorrhage, postopera-
tive pain, and length of hospital stay after
surgery in patients undergoing coblation
tonsillectomy with or without microscopic
guidance. The use of a microscope during
surgery does not simply enlarge the field of
vision, it offers an innovative change to the
surgical approach. Therefore, this article also
summarizes the key technical aspects of this
surgical approach.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study retrieved the
medical records of adult patients (>18
years old) who underwent tonsillectomy at
the Department of Otolaryngology, The
Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai,
Fudan University, Shanghai, China,
between January 2010 and December 2013.
Diagnosis of and treatment for tonsillar
hypertrophy and chronic tonsillitis were
performed by a single surgeon with a
decade of experience in various types of
tonsil surgeries (Y.P.). Exclusion criteria
were: history of acute tonsil infection
within the previous 2 weeks; peritonsillitis;
systemic diseases such as heart disease and
coagulopathies. Patients undergoing tonsil-
lar biopsy, unilateral tonsillectomy, tonsil-
lectomy for known carcinoma, and
tonsillectomy in conjunction with palatal
surgery were also excluded.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Fifth People's Hospital of
Shanghai, Fudan University, and all
patients provided written informed consent.
Surgical technique
Microscope-assisted ablation tonsillectomy
was introduced in our institution in 2011.
Patients were not randomized because surgi-
cal approach was determined by admission
date. All tonsillectomies were performed by
a single attending surgeon (Y.P.) with assist-
ance from one of two residents (J.H. or S.H.),
using a COBLATORÕ II (ArthroCareÕ,
Smith & Nephew, London, UK). For sur-
geries performed under a microscope
(OPMIÕ PRO magis; Carl Zeiss Microscopy
GmbH, Munich, Germany), images were
magnified 3­8 times (Figure 1).
The surgical approach when using a
microscope differs from that without
a microscope in several ways. When using
a microscope, an incision is made at the
junction of the palatoglossal arch and the
tonsils using a coblation plasma wand
(EVACÕ 70 XTRA HP; Smith & Nephew).
The upper poles of the tonsils are gradually
pulled to allow separation from the incision
to the tonsillar capsule. Compared with
conventional surgery, the incision is closer
to the tonsils to avoid damage to the
palatoglossal arch mucosa around the
uvula as far as possible and prevent post-
operative uvular oedema. During the
924 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
gradual separation of the tonsil, the
microscopic angle can be adjusted to accom-
modate the surgical site. Use of the micro-
scope thus allows better visualization of the
surgical field, particularly for treatment of
the lower poles of the tonsils, as there is no
residual lower pole tissue.
Intraoperative ablation with a plasma
wand is performed only for the loose
tissue between the capsule and pharyngeal
muscles during microscope-assisted surgery,
thereby avoiding direct damage to
the parapharyngeal muscles. In contrast
to coblation tonsillectomy without micro-
scopic guidance, the white envelope of the
tonsils can be completely distinguished,
along with fine (0.1­0.2 mm diameter)
blood vessels around the tonsils. Only the
nourishing blood vessels penetrating the
tonsils and entering the envelopes are
occluded during surgery. Damage to tonsil-
lar arteries and paratonsillar veins is effect-
ively avoided by the use of the microscope.
In our experience, damage to the paraton-
sillar vein (external palatine vein) is a major
cause of blood loss during treatment of the
upper pole using conventional surgery. Use
of a microscope allows this vein to be
effectively distinguished, and occlusion
of only the vein network exported from the
capsule of the tonsil is easily avoided, limit-
ing blood loss. All surgeries were performed
under general anaesthesia with sterilized
drapes. A Boyle­Davis gag was used to
expose the surgical field.
Outcomes
Patient data included those recorded during
surgery, intraoperative blood loss and dur-
ation of postoperative hospital stay.
Intraoperative blood loss was calculated by
a nurse as the volume of fluid drained via
suction minus the volume of saline flush
(minimum quantifiable volume 5 ml).
Postoperative haemorrhage was defined as
continuous bleeding that patient had to spit
out or swallow and was considered to have
occurred if the wound actively bled and
required management by the responsible
clinician (including local oppression, haemo-
stasis, haemostyptic or surgical rebleeding),
or bled again after improvement. Primary
haemorrhage occurred within the first 24h
postoperatively, and secondary haemorrhage
occurred after 24h postoperatively.

Follow-up
Tonsillectomy in China generally requires
2­4 days of hospitalized postoperative
observation. In addition, at our hospital,
special staff members perform postoperative
telephone follow-up, during which doctors
guide the patients to take oral analgesics
regularly and answer the patients' questions
to establish good communication and
ensure compliance. All patients routinely
received oral nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs (300 mg ibuprofen, twice daily)
for analgesia during the first 5 postoperative
days, with instructions to use medications
as needed for the next 6 ­ 10 days.
Postoperative pain was graded on a scale
of 0 to 10 using a Visual Analogue Scale
(VAS), where 0 indicates no pain, 1­3
represents mild pain, 4­7 represents moder-
ate pain, and 10 indicates extreme pain. A
score of 3 was set as the cut-off value as it
was considered to indicate a level of pain
that did not affect the patient's quality-of-
life or sleep. A nurse recorded pain scores at
rest and on swallowing daily at the same
time for the first 10 postoperative days by
face-to-face or telephone inquiry. The
number of days until a patient reported a
pain score of 3 was recorded.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD.
Duration of surgery, intraoperative blood
loss, and duration of postoperative stay
were analysed using Student's independent
two-sample t-test. Postoperative haemor-
rhage was analysed using 2-test. Multiple
linear regression analysis was used for
between-group comparison of postoperative
pain scores, using postoperative day and
surgery type as independent variables and
pain score as dependent variable. Between-
group differences in the number of days
required for a patient to report a score of 3
were compared using Student's t-test.
Statistical analyses were performed using
StataÕ version 12 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX, USA). A P-value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study retrospectively reviewed the med-
ical records of 411 patients. After exclusions,
the final analysis included 168 patients
(82 males/86 females; mean age 25.1 Æ 6.9
years; age range 18 ­ 53 years). Patients were
stratified according to the use of a surgical
microscope: direct vision group (n ¼ 76;
37 males/39 females; mean age 23.6 Æ 7.2
years; age range 19 ­ 46 years) and micro-
scope group (n ¼ 92; 45 males/47 females;
mean age 26.4 Æ 6.5 years; age range 18 ­ 53
years). Similar proportions of patients in
each group were prescribed analgesia in the
first 5 days after surgery (direct vision group,
92.4% [85/92]; microscope group, 89.5%
[68/76]). After day 5, 39.1% (36/92) of
patients in the direct vision group and
44.7% (34/76) in the microscope group
continued to take analgesic medication.
Clinical data are shown in Table 1. There
was no significant between-group difference
in duration of surgery, intraoperative blood
loss, or the incidence of primary haemor-
rhage. The incidence of secondary haemor-
rhage and duration of hospital stay were
significantly lower in the microscope group
than the direct vision group (P < 0.05 and
P < 0.01, respectively; Table 1).
Multivariate linear regression analysis
found that postoperative day and surgery
type were significantly associated with post-
operative pain scores both at rest and on
swallowing (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
Pain scores were significantly lower in the
microscope group than the direct vision
group, both at rest (­1.005 points, 95%
confidence interval [CI] À 1.125, À0.886)
and while swallowing (­0.934 points, 95%
CI, À1.074, À0.794). Pain scores both at rest
and while swallowing reached 3

than the direct vision group (P < 0.001 for
each comparison; Table 1).
Discussion
Tonsillectomy has been traditionally
regarded as a minor surgery, and otolaryn-
gologists have therefore not always con-
sidered the need for further optimization
and innovation in this field. Coblation ton-
sillectomy has the primary advantage of
limited thermal damage compared with
alternative forms of surgery. Derived from
``controlled ablation,'' the name refers to the
non-heat driven process of surgically dis-
sociating soft tissue using bipolar radio-
frequency energy to excite electrolytes in a
conductive medium (such as saline solution)
to create a precisely focused plasma field
with a surface temperature of 40­70C.11
Coblation tonsillectomy is an improvement
over electrosurgery using monopolar blades
or bipolar suction, with respect to damage
deep in the surgical cavity.12­19
The primary advantage of surgery using a
microscope over direct vision is the ability to
observe the detailed anatomy of the extra-
capsular loose tissues of the tonsil. In
addition, surgical assistants and students
can directly observe the surgical process
through a secondary mirror or external
monitor. Even with the application of new
techniques, the majority of tonsillectomies
are performed under direct vision. Surgeons
commonly perform this procedure using a
2.5­5 Â surgical loupe and a headlamp,
although the magnification, lighting and
image field are inferior to those achieved
with a microscope. In contrast to loupes and
headlamps, the magnification of a micro-
scope can be adjusted at any time during
surgery; it can be set to 3Â at the beginning
of surgery and increased to 6­8Â when
required for the precise separation of sur-
rounding blood vessels. Moreover, surgical
microscopes have a mechanical arm bracket
for positioning that prevents the field of view
from moving and is very flexible. The visual
and light axes are almost parallel, allowing
deep illumination and visualization of the
surgical site. These features improve visual-
ization of the tonsillar surgical cavity.
Microscopes result in better representation
of the colour, brightness and clarity of light
than loupes and headlamps, and can be
connected to an image display system to
facilitate teaching.

The use of a microscope for tonsillec-
tomy results in the procedure being minim-
ally invasive. In our experience, minimally
invasive tonsil surgery results in a decrease
in primary and secondary haemorrhage
rates and less tissue damage. Wide ablation
is unnecessary and thermal damage to
tissues is limited. The severity of post-
operative pain and the average time to
achieve the cut-off pain score of 3 were
significantly lower in the microscope group
than the direct vision group in the present
study. This is likely to be related to
decreased intraoperative damage to sur-
rounding tissues, confirming the results of
others.18,20­23 Pain records and statistical
aspects may be influenced by the use of oral
medication, however, and although each
patient received ibuprofen, variations in
compliance can cause bias.
Coblation tonsillectomy has been shown
to result in less intraoperative blood loss
than conventional tonsil dissection with
cooling instruments.24­32 The majority of
tonsil dissections involve a blood loss of
<40 ml and, although this volume is not
harmful to patients, reduced blood loss
allows a clearer surgical field and facilitates
simplified surgery. Haemostasis was
achieved at the end surgery in the present
study, and the incidence of primary haem-
orrhage was significantly lower than that
reported after conventional tonsil dissection
with cooling instruments (7.4%).33 It has
been found that the incidence of secondary
haemorrhage after coblation tonsillectomy
was higher than that after surgery with
cooling instruments.34­36 The denatured col-
lagen formed by thermal damage can result
in a thin protective layer covering the
surface of the tonsillar fossa.36 This post-
operative protective layer in the surgical
cavity is thicker than that formed after
conventional tonsillectomy, slowing the
infiltration of inflammatory cells and for-
mation of fibrous tissue, and resulting in an
increase in the incidence of delayed
postoperative haemorrhage.37 There was
no significant between-group difference in
the incidence of primary, short-term haem-
orrhage in the present study, but there were
significantly fewer cases of secondary haem-
orrhage in the microscope group than the
direct vision group. We believe that the
technical precision provided by surgical
microscopy decreased the degree of thermal
damage in the surgical cavity compared with
conventional surgery. In addition, the use of
a microscope decreased the damage to the
extracapsular vessels, particularly the para-
tonsillar vein.
This study has several limitations. First,
postoperative bleeding after tonsillectomy is
uncommon, therefore the sample size for
this event was small. A further limitation
was the retrospective design and small over-
all sample size. Although all suitable
patients were included, the sample size was
determined by the number of patients that
fulfilled the inclusion criteria within the
study period. In addition, because it was
not possible to determine the precise daily
medication use of patients there was an
inevitable bias with regard to the use of
analgesia. There were no obvious between-
group differences in prescription of
analgesics, however. Additional prospective
studies with a larger sample size are required
to confirm the findings of this study.
In conclusion, the use of a surgical
microscope during coblation tonsillectomy
decreases the duration of hospital stay and
the incidence of postoperative secondary
haemorrhage, and results in an early
improvement in postoperative pain scores.
This technique is also useful for medical
teaching.
