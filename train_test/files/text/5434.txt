Introduction
Street vending serves as a major source of employment and
income for urban residents the world over, especially in
developing countries (Chen, 2004; Donovan, 2008).
Operating from the streets, street vendors may work from
permanent locations, or may be mobile, carrying their wares
to customers at places of high pedestrian concentrations
(Bhowmik, 2005). By their presence and activities, however,
street vendors in different parts of the developing world have
been in confrontation with city authorities or regulators over
space for business, conditions of work, sanitation, and licens-
ing (Anjaria, 2006;Asiedu &Agyei-Mensah, 2008; Milgram,
2011; Popke & Ballard, 2004; Skinner, 2008a). These two
groups (street vendors and regulators) have interests that
often contradict or compete (Austin, 1994).
As a result of the competing interests between street ven-
dors and regulators, street vending has come to depend largely
on a constant negotiation among vendors, buyers, and regula-
tors (Asiedu & Agyei-Mensah, 2008; Recio & Gomez, 2013).
Negotiations may be for public space, for economic opportu-
nity, and for power, and may involve the general public, shop
owners, and urban regulators (Asiedu & Agyei-Mensah,
2008). Among street vendors, regulators, pedestrians, and the
general public, negotiations may occur regarding what can be
considered an acceptable and unacceptable use of space, as
well as what can be considered rights of the vendor to operate
and earn a living from public spaces against the rights of the
state to maintain public spaces (Drummond, 2000). These
negotiations for public space and their outcome have impor-
tant implications for the well-being of street vendors, because
having a good space for vending is one of a variety of signifi-
cant factors that affect the well-being of street vendors (Cohen,
Bhatt, & Horn, 2000).
Even though different authors have documented the nego-
tiation strategies of vendors in specific countries, this review
presents a synthesized, holistic, and coherent insight by
bringing together the various strategies that vendors have
used in urban areas of developing countries and analyzing
them through the lens of relevant theoretical concepts of
power, social networks, and social perception.

Negotiation and Management Strategies
of Street Vendors in Developing
Countries: A Narrative Review
John B. Forkuor1, Kofi O. Akuoko1, and Eric H. Yeboah1
Abstract
The existing literature on the relationship between regulators and street vendors remain fragmented and limited to specific
countries and contexts. This article presents a narrative review of the existing literature on the relationship between regulators
and street vendors, and through that creates a unified picture of an otherwise fragmented literature and knowledge base.
The concepts of negotiation, power, social network, and perception are used to analyze the various strategies street vendors
have used in gaining access to urban public spaces in different parts of the developing world. It is revealed that even though
city regulators have access to formal power, street vendors possess a variety of negotiating strategies that gives them access
to both formal and informal power.

Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion of
Relevant Documents
First, articles on the World Wide Web, without a clearly spec-
ified author or organization responsible, were excluded
because information from such documents could not be veri-
fied and relied on.
Second, it was required that articles must primarily be a
journal or newspaper article, a research report, or a confer-
ence proceeding reporting on primary data or primary
research. Journal articles were included because journal arti-
cles often use primary research data and were, as a result, a
good source of primary research on the tension between ven-
dors and regulators in different parts of the developing world.
The other sources indicated, commonly known as gray litera-
ture, were included because Jones (2004) argues that as a
result of publication bias, a lot of information do not get pub-
lished in journals. Consequently, including gray literature in
this review helped to eliminate the potential for such publica-
tion bias.
Third, it was required that the document should focus on
a developing country context, and must have as, either its
primary focus or part of its focus, a discussion of the rela-
tionship between regulators and street vendors. The empha-
sis on a developing country context was to ensure a good
synthesisofinformationondevelopingcountries.Developing
countries are urbanizing at a faster rate and street vending is
one of the most common phenomena associated with urban-
ization in developing countries. Thus, the similarity of con-
text (in terms of the vending activity, the use of public space
and public space regulation) allows for literature from these
contexts to be analyzed in generating a more synthesized
knowledge base for street vending, to be used by stakehold-
ers involved in street vending.
This review focused on literature between the year 2000
and 2016. This is because literature from the 21st century
provides the best option of gaining a better insight into the
relationship between city authorities and vendors. An insight
that is more in tune with the present state of the relationship
between city authorities and vendors in developing coun-
tries. Thus, focusing on literature from the 21st century pro-
vides an opportunity for using relevant, up to date information
on the negotiated relationship between vendors and city
authorities. Finally, this study's focus is not to present a his-
torical review of how this relationship has changed over time
per se but rather to provide a narrative review of the nature
and dynamics of this relationship as it exists presently. Hence
the emphasis on literature from the 21st century.
Types of Documents Included in
Review
On the whole, three main categories of documents were used
as part of this review. The first category was scientific peer
reviewed journal articles. The second category included
reports, working papers, and conference proceedings down-
loaded from the database of relevant international organiza-
tions such as Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing
and Organizing (WIEGO) and the International Labor
Organization (ILO). The third and final category of docu-
ments included newspaper articles and media reports from
different parts of the world. The first two categories may be
considered as scientific sources of information, while the last
may be classified simply as media.
Searching for Documents: Search
Engines, Keywords, Journals, and
Databases
As emphasized by Green, Johnson, and Adams (2006), it is
important for authors of narrative review articles to clearly
indicate the databases and keywords used in searching for
articles. For this review, the document repositories of inter-
national organizations like WIEGO and ILO were searched
to identify articles, working papers, conference proceedings,
and technical reports. In addition, the first author subscribed
to WIEGO's online news roundup, receiving as a result, a
compilation of global news coverage, reflecting print and
electronic media coverage on the informal economy, includ-
ing street vending. This proved to be an important source of
information on the discourse about street vendors in different
parts of the world.
Research articles included in the review were also identi-
fied from journals such as Environment and Urbanization,
Geoforum, Urban Studies, Journal of Development Studies,
Journal of Modern African Studies, Qualitative Sociology,
and Economic and Political Weekly. Some keywords and
phrases that were used for the article search were as follows:
street vending; trading on the streets; street traders; regulat-
ing street vending; street vendors and urban regulators; pri-
vate and public space; and ownership of public space.
Analysis of Documents
Each article was read twice. The first reading was to famil-
iarize researchers with the content of the article or publica-
tion. A second more detailed reading was conducted to
identify and tag the strategies that vendors use to negotiate
for space. Once identified, the individual strategies were
summarized by a descriptive word or phrase, with the word
or phrase serving as codes for further analysis. For instance,
phrases like "court action," "bargaining with votes," "pay-
ment of tokens," and "carrying few goods" were some of the
codes used to summarize the strategies used by vendors to
negotiate for space. Subsequently, the codes were examined,
and similar codes put together to form a theme. Thus, within
one theme could be found strategies from different studies.
For instance, "court action" and "bargaining" with votes
were put together under the theme "macrolevel negotiating
strategies," while "carrying few goods" and "payment of
Forkuor et al. 3
tokens" came under the theme "microlevel negotiating strat-
egies." The main findings were subsequently organized and
explored around the main identified themes.
Summary of Data Set
In sum, this review identified 31 relevant articles and reports
from three different regions of the world: Africa, Asia, and
South America. Eighteen of these were journal articles, six
were newspaper and media reports, and seven were policy
briefs, working papers or research reports. Refer to Table 1
for brief descriptions of articles and reports used for this
review.
Results
In presenting the findings, a review of how street vendors
have been portrayed and perceived, and the implications of
these perceptions for the livelihoods of street vendors are
first presented. This is followed by a review of the key strate-
gies street vendors have used in negotiating for space in
urban areas. The various ways in which power, both formal
and informal, manifests itself in this negotiated setting will
be explored.
Perceptions About Street Vendors
Different stakeholders in different parts of the developing
world have perceived street vendors in different ways.
Predominantly, however, these perceptions have been posi-
tive or negative, focusing mostly on vendors' occupation of
public space and the effects such occupation has on urban
residents and urban life (Donovan, 2008). This section dis-
cusses how street vendors have been perceived mostly not
only by urban authorities but also by urban residents and
other urban actors in relation to their use of urban space. It is
revealed that even though negative perception of vendors
exists, this perception is not limited to the activity of vending
itself but mostly on the location of vending. In line with this,
this section reveals how perception can be fluid, changing
from favorable to nonfavorable during different times of the
day and different seasons.
Negative Perception of Vending
First, city authorities and regulators have often perceived and
portrayed street vending as negatively affecting the attrac-
tiveness and beauty of their cities. In African cities like
Kumasi in Ghana, for instance, street vendors are perceived
by city authorities as sources of congestion and poor envi-
ronmental sanitation, and their structures are seen as destroy-
ing "the aesthetic quality of the urban settlements"
(Solomon-Ayeh, Sylvana, & Decardi-Nelson, 2011, p. 21).
Similarly, in SouthernAmerican andAsian cities like Mexico
city in Mexico, Santiago in Chile, and Mumbai in India,
street vendors are often portrayed as offensive and illegiti-
mate invaders, who inhibit the ability of cities to modernize
and achieve a global status (Crossa, 2009; Rajagopal, 2001;
Stillerman, 2006; Turner & Schoenberger, 2012). Street ven-
dors are perceived as a sign of chaos and disorder; and a
failure of metropolitan authorities to instill order within the
cities (Crossa, 2009; Rajagopal, 2001; Stillerman, 2006;
Turner & Schoenberger, 2012). Rajagopal (2001) further
explains that in Mumbai India, "street vendors are seen as
offensive, inconvenient, and illegitimate . . . a symbol of
metropolitan space gone out of control" (p. 94). The media
plays a crucial role in shaping the negative perceptions of the
public regarding street vendors (Rajagopal, 2001).
Publications and news items sometimes portray a negative
image of street vendors. A search of the print media in Ghana
on articles about street vendors reveals how the phenomenon
of street vending is discussed in the public arena, and the
image of street vendors that emerges out of this discourse.
Journalists use terms such as swarm, take over, invade,
flooded to describe vendors' occupation of public spaces,
suggesting the undesirability of their occupation of public
spaces: those "daredevil hawkers" as one journalist simply
puts it in the Ghanaian Times newspaper (Anyimah-Ackah,
2007;Asare, 2006; Baffloe, 2006; Benghan, 2011). Reporting
on street vendors in Belo Horizonte in Brazil, Carrieri and
Murta (2011) also cite instances where newspapers argue in
favor of city authorities and present a negative image of
street vendors to readers and the public. The authors indicate
how words such as riots, fear, criminality, violence, and
organized crime have been used to represent vendors. As a
result of these negative perceptions, street vending in general
has become a phenomenon associated with poor level of city
or urban development and modernization (Anjaria, 2006).
Thus, "by working on the streets, they are engaged in an
activity that contradicts the supposed universal ideals of the
modern public space" (Anjaria, 2006, p. 2142).Alternatively,
street vendors are perceived as elements who do not belong
as part of the urban and modern landscape, they are consid-
ered as "out of place" urban elements (Yatmo, 2009).
In addition to its negative effects on the image of cities,
street vendors have often been perceived as creating a safe
haven, through their congestion of streets, for crime to flour-
ish. They are considered as untrustworthy people who, in
collaboration with thieves and drug dealers deceive unsus-
pecting members of the public and pedestrians (Austin,
1994). Thus, for some shop owners in Bogota Colombia,
street traders bring only disorder, filth, and the risk of crime
and theft (Donovan, 2008). By their congestion of city
streets, they are perceived as making it possible for thieves to
hide and move among them unnoticed, a situation that
adversely affects the activities of more established and for-
mal shop owners (Donovan, 2008). Finally, street vendors
are also perceived as creating unfair competition for more
established shop owners, subsequently reducing the profits
of shop owners by offering pirated and counterfeit goods and

commodities for sale at very low prices (Mitullah, 2003).
Owners of shops in Mumbai, India, and in Bogota, Colombia,
have been vocal in this regard. These shop owners have
expressed concerns that street traders provide unhealthy
competition and drain the income of more established, regis-
tered and taxpaying shop owners (Donovan, 2008; Rajagopal,
2001). Similarly, Steel (2012) reports of more established
shop owners in Cusco, Peru, who complain about their loss
of autonomy over the sale of products and the competition
that vendors bring with them, with its associated declines in
sales and earnings.
Positive and Fluid Perceptions
These negative perceptions notwithstanding, Yatmo (2009)
explains, based on a research in Jakarta, Indonesia, that the
negative perception of street vendors as out of place ele-
ments in the urban landscape is not absolute but rather, a
fluid phenomenon, changing with time of day. Yatmo (2009)
argues by emphasizing that
the evaluation of street vendors as out of place elements change
from day-time to night-time . . . suggesting that the generalisation
of judgement that the street vendors are out of place in any
locations at any time may not be entirely correct. (p. 473)
Yatmo (2009) explains that at night-time, respondents per-
ceived street vendors as more organized with cleaner envi-
ronments, in contrast with their perceptions of vendors
during the days. This fluidity in the perception of vendors
describes the attitude of some city authorities toward the
phenomenon of street vending. There is evidence to suggest
that in some countries, urban authorities' perceptions of ven-
dors and their attitude to street vending in general change
during different economic periods (Donovan, 2008). In
Bangkok and Thailand, for instance, the financial and eco-
nomic recession of 1997 compelled people into the Street
Food (SF) trade as a source of income and employment
(Chung, Ritoper, & Takemoto, 2010). The central and munic-
ipal governments of Thailand and Bangkok, respectively,
went to the extent of encouraging citizens to take up SF
vending as an alternate source of income during this finan-
cial crisis (Chung et al., 2010). Harper (1996, cited in
Donovan, 2008) also reports that during economic difficul-
ties in the 1990s, the Mayor of Kuala Lumpur reduced regu-
lations on vendor licenses and set aside more areas for street
vending to take place. This fluidity in perceptions empha-
sizes the fact that vending is only problematic during specific
periods and in particular locations.
Furthermore, the argument has been made, for instance, that
by their mere presence, street vendors serve and act as deterrent
of various forms of crimes on city streets (Anjaria, 2006). In
Mumbai, street vendors have on occasion protected women
against sexual harassment (Anjaria, 2006). Consequently, ven-
dors and street traders are perceived as providing important
security for more established shop owners and the general pub-
lic as a whole, maintaining a watchful eye over events, and
showing up to assist in case of accidents and emergencies on
the streets (Anjaria, 2006). Where shop owners hold such per-
ceptions of street vendors, there evolves a special kind of rela-
tionship built on trust between the vendors and the shop owners
(Anjaria, 2006). This perception of street vendors as capable of
preventing crime has also been evident in Durban, South
Africa, where street vendors have worked hand-in-hand with
the police in preventing crime on the streets (Skinner, 2008).
Here, street vendors have been trained by the police to monitor
their streets and to inform the police when they feel something
is not right (Skinner, 2008). Through such collaborative efforts,
Skinner (2008b) reports that there has been a significant reduc-
tion in the incidence of crime in the inner city areas of Durban.
What is evident is that, despite the fact that street vendors are
sometimes accused of promoting crime, there are instances
where street vendors have worked to eliminate the same forms
of crime they are accused of. There are other instances where
more established shop owners perceive street vendors not as
offering unfair competition but rather as an avenue for business
development. In Mexico City in Mexico, for instance, Crossa
(2009) reports that a special alliance exists between street ven-
dors and shop owners, where street vendors sometimes "sell
products on the street on behalf of shop owners" (p. 55).
However, like the above, the emphasis have been predomi-
nantly on the negative effects that street vending have for for-
mal businesses, with very little attention paid to the benefits
and opportunities that street vending present for formal
businesses.
Evidently, wherever city authorities and other members of
the public perceive street vendors positively, the larger urban
community benefit through the collaborative efforts and the
positive effects that result. Interestingly, these positive effects
seem to receive very little attention from city and urban
authorities in general. On the contrary, the argument has over-
whelmingly been on the negative effects street vendors have
on cities and the "illegality" of the street vending activity. It
could be argued, however, that the problem is often not with
the activity of vending itself but mostly the location that
vending takes place. Thus, the negative perception often
relate to the space/site for vending and that vending in itself is
also perceived positively as an important economic activity
providing important benefits for urban residents.
City Authorities and Their Response to
Street Vending
In line with the perceptions of a modern and global city, evic-
tion and relocation campaigns are undertaken by city author-
ities to "clean up" the city and make it more "attractive"
(Anjaria, 2006; Donovan, 2008; Milgram, 2011). Where
vendors are perceived as a nuisance, a symbol of chaos and
disorder, eviction is often intense, involving the use of
8 SAGE Open
bulldozers, and justified as necessary to restore "order" and
"sanity" back to city life (Rajagopal, 2001). Examples of
such evictions and relocations have been undertaken in India,
Vietnam, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, and in other
developing countries in Africa (Anjaria, 2006; Donovan,
2008; Drummond, 2000).
These evictions and relocations can be conceived as a
demonstration of the power of cities and urban areas over
residents and street vendors (Skinner, 2008a). This is
because, within a social negotiated setting, those who are in
need of something are usually constrained by the actions of
those who can satisfy their needs (Fine, 1984). Similarly,
street vendors, working with limited or no infrastructural
facilities and limited access to competitive space for busi-
ness are often constrained by the conditions laid down by
city authorities and regulators who control vital public space.
Thus, city regulators have often used the prevailing negative
perception about street vendors as a negotiating tool to gain
more power, which enhances their claim over crucial public
space. Similar to the above, Mitullah (2006) has reasoned
that the eviction of street vendors from busy city centers
have power implications because the vacation of the streets
by street vendors makes these profitable streets and city cen-
ters available to large scale and powerful formal businesses
at the expense of small scale vendors. The eviction of ven-
dors by force, the destruction of perceived illegal vending
stands, and the confiscation and sometimes destruction of
goods demonstrate the extent, nature, and effects of the
power held by city regulators (Rajagopal, 2001).
Negotiating for Space: Street Vendors
and City Authorities
Street vendors, despite the above information, are not "power-
less" in the face of eviction and relocation. As participants
actively reinterpreting and renegotiating their realities, street
vendors have a variety of strategies available to them, a sign of
their own power, in the face of eviction and relocation. This
section discusses some of the strategies that street vendors, as
individuals and as organized groups, have used in securing
access to important locations for vending in urban areas of
developing countries. Using examples from different places,
the section demonstrates how the use of these strategies gives
some form of power to street vendors in their relationship with
city authorities. These negotiating strategies can be classified
under two main categories: negotiations that take place at the
macrolevel (between organized groups of vendors and state
authorities), and negotiations that take place at the microlevel
(between individual street vendors and city regulators).
Negotiating at the Macrolevel
For some street traders and vendors, the use of public space
is closely linked with the right to survive and to earn a liveli-
hood, a right that must be fought for and protected. Rajagopal
(2001) reports that in negotiating for a space for business,
some street vendors in Mumbai, India have gone as far as
fight for this right in the law courts, taking on city authorities
and subsequently gaining the right to vend within specific
city spaces (Rajagopal, 2001). This strategy is also common
among street vendors in other Indian cities like Delhi
(Schindler, 2013). Rajagopal, 2001) writes,
Hawkers have also learned to use the courts instrumentally.
Some hawkers were thus appealing for injunctions against
demolitions or eviction in different courts under different names.
When a hawker lost a case in the city civil court, he or she would
move to the high court without revealing the details of the earlier
case. Sometimes, a wife or a brother would move to another
courtoverthesamehawkingspot.Thehearingsandadjournments
translated into valuable business time for the hawker. (p. 107)
This strategy of negotiating for space has also been
reported among street vendors in Bogota city in Colombia,
where vendors have often responded to threats of eviction
with a legal action arguing that eviction will go contrary to
their right to work and earn a living (Donovan, 2008). What
happens then is that vendors begin to make use of the same
institutions that legitimizes the power of regulators, they
have learnt to use the same tools that the state uses against
them to fight back and to gain power (Rajagopal, 2001).
In addition to using the courts as a negotiating tool and
source of power, other vendors as a group, have used their
votes as a bargaining power in negotiating with city authori-
ties. This is especially significant where the vendor popula-
tion is large, as it is in Mexico city (Donovan, 2008). In this
instance, street vendors vote into power their own nominated
individuals who in turn allow them to vend on city streets
(Donovan, 2008). In other instances, vendors " . . . secured
licenses in exchange for political support during city elec-
tions . . ." (Donovan, 2008, p. 35). Voting for people into city
councils and other positions has also been revealed as a com-
mon strategy by street traders in the northern city of Baguio
in the Philippines (Milgram, 2011). The votes of street ven-
dors are important as a negotiating tool, to the extent that it
can change policies, albeit temporarily. Thus, Milgram
(2011) writes regarding vendors in the Philippines that "since
municipal elections were scheduled for May 2010, the then
current city counsellors hesitated to introduce new bye laws
that might arouse the displeasure of their constituents,
including vendors, and thus threaten their chances of re-elec-
tions" (p. 284). In Malawi in Africa, by voting for "council-
lors" of local assemblies, street vendors were assured of a
protective voice within local authorities as these councilors
acknowledged the support of the vendors in bringing them
into office (Kayuni & Tambulasi, 2009). Kayuni and
Tambulasi (2009) write the following of the councilors in
Malawi: "most councillors knew that they were brought into
office through mostly the support of the vendors themselves.
In this regard, the vendors had, to some extent, an authorita-
tive voice through the councillors" (p. 88). Not only do these
Forkuor et al. 9
placed officials lobby city authorities on behalf of street trad-
ers in securing access to public spaces for business, they also
serve as crucial sources of information about the actions and
inactions of city authorities regarding impending evictions
and raids through the city center (Milgram, 2011). Because
knowing when to run or leave a place of business is a crucial
part of the negotiation for and use of space among street trad-
ers and vendors, well-placed sources in positions of authority
within urban areas help street traders to effectively negotiate
for and use space to enhance their livelihoods (Milgram,
2011). Milgram (2011) quotes one respondent as saying,
"We actively sought friends in City Hall who agreed to tell us
when a raid is scheduled if they hear about it in advance" (p.
282). In effect, one major strategy that street vendors have
used in getting access to and using city spaces is to either use
their votes as a bargaining power or to vote for their own into
public offices who in turn will lobby for the street vendors.
Once again, vendors are demonstrated as using what they
have, their vote, to negotiate and gain power (Crossa, 2009).
One other macro strategy that street vendors have used to
negotiate for space in urban areas is through public demon-
strations. These demonstrations may take the form of public
rallies, where vendors sometimes march on city authorities
and hand over demands and grievances, an approach which
has been used effectively by vendors in Durban, South
Africa, in preventing eviction (Skinner, 2008b) as well as in
Caloocan in Manila, the Philippines (Recio & Gomez, 2013).
Sometimes these public demonstrations take violent forms,
as has been reported in Mexico City in Mexico (Crossa,
2009). Crossa (2009) cites an example from April 2002
where hundreds of street vendors came together in Mexico
City, sprayed the police with tear gas, and hit them with
sticks when the police attempted to evict them from operat-
ing in the city center. Here, street vendors gain power through
numbers and use some of the same strategies that city author-
ities have used against them in resisting eviction and main-
taining the use of city spaces.
Another form of public demonstration, as revealed by
Milgram (2011) and Recio and Gomez (2013) take the form
of letter writing campaigns organized by members of street
vendor associations aimed at city authorities, demonstrating
against an impending eviction and proving, through their let-
ters, why they should be allowed to operate under certain
occasions. Recio and Gomez (2013) report how street ven-
dors in Caloocan, Metro Manila, in the Philippines engage
city regulators and authorities in discussions with an aim of
bringing their grievances before such authority figures.
Alternatively, street vendors in Dakar, Senegal, have used
open forums, where vendor associations meet with govern-
ment officials to discuss their concerns (Bass, 2000).
International organizations and nongovernmental organi-
zations (NGOs) also play an important role in macro negotia-
tion activities of informal sector workers in general and street
vendors specifically. Organizations such as the Street Net
International, International Domestic Workers Network,
International Transport Worker's Federation, WIEGO, Latin
American Waste Picker Network (Red Lacre), Global
Alliance of Waste Pickers, and Home Net South Asia assist
informal sector workers by building a global network and
involving in transnational advocacy to promote the rights
and well-being of informal sector workers including street
vendors (Bonner, 2009; Bonner & Carré, 2013; Horn, 2014).
Currently, The Street Net International and WIEGO are
among some of the globally recognized organizations con-
cerned about the rights of informal workers in general and
street vendors specifically (Bonner, 2009; Bonner & Carré,
2013; Horn, 2014). The Street Net International, a member-
ship-based organization (such as trade unions, cooperatives,
or associations), directly organizes street vendors, market
vendors, and/or hawkers to negotiate with city authorities
and to improve the work conditions of informal sector street
workers (Bonner, 2009; Bonner & Carré, 2013; Horn, 2014).
They organize bargaining forums with city officials, helping
to promote the exchange of information and ideas on critical
issues facing street vendors, market vendors, and hawkers. In
addition, they help enlighten street workers and other infor-
mal sector workers on how to exercise their rights against
harassment (Bonner, 2009; Bonner & Carré, 2013; Horn,
2014). In attempt to fight for their rights, informal workers
form association and then liaise with these international
organizations/NGOs to help them negotiate with government
officials to effect changes in policies.
Through these macro strategies, street vendors in differ-
ent parts of the developing world have sought to stake a
claim for their use of public space and to negotiate against
eviction and relocation campaigns. It is important to note
though that even though the macro strategies discussed
above have been demonstrated to be generally effective for
all street vendors and to represent their power, there remain
considerable within-group differences in terms of its benefits
for different categories (age, sex, and class) of vendors.
Thus, individual vendors may benefit differently from these
strategies depending on their sex, age, and social class. Bass
(2000) in a research of the negotiating strategies of street
vendors in Senegal draws attention to how the above sociode-
mographic characteristics define the benefits that particular
groups of vendors gain. Using evidence from her research,
Bass (2000) makes a strong argument for how gender, age,
and class determines the negotiating power of different
groups. Bass (2000) finds, for instance, that because female
street vendors had less social authority to assert themselves,
they were less able to negotiate for their interests, and often
made their interests secondary to that of their male counter-
parts in negotiating with city officials. The concerns specific
to female vendors who often sell different products from the
males and thus often have some challenges specific to their
situation are often left unaddressed during macrolevel nego-
tiations with state officials (Bass, 2000). In addition to sex,
Bass (2000) finds further differentiation based on age and
class where the needs of older and more established vendors,
10 SAGE Open
for instance, get more attention and promoted in the negotia-
tion process than younger and less established vendors. By
so doing, Bass (2000) not only emphasizes the negotiating
power of vendors as a group but further draws attention to
the power differentials and differences in the ability to nego-
tiate that may emerge among vendors.
Negotiating at the Microlevel
At a more microlevel, street vendors have used a variety of
approaches to negotiate for and have access to vend within
city spaces and to avoid eviction.
Networking and communication among colleague vendors
is one of the negotiating strategies that street vendors have
used. This is where vendors communicate with each other and
warn each other of impending threats from city authorities.
For instance, Crossa (2009), in writing about the resistance
strategies of street vendors in Mexico city's city center indi-
cates that some street vendors are: "paid to monitor the streets,
watch for the police, and to warn other vendors of police activ-
ities through the use of walkie talkies" (p. 56). Alternatively,
Crossa (2009) reports that on a day to day basis, vendors warn
each other by "whistling to each other to sound the alert about
police activities or other impending threats" (p. 56). Another
form of networking among vendors in using city spaces is
where vendors send messages alerting each other of the pres-
ence or otherwise of city authorities. Recio and Gomez (2013)
report of what they term as "Quick Response Teams" (QRTs)
in Caloocan, Metro Manila, where these QRTs act as a form of
early warning system, using text messages to warn colleague
vendors of imminent or ongoing eviction operations (Recio &
Gomez, 2013). Alternatively, Steel (2012) writing about street
vendors in Peru has indicated that street vendors, running from
eviction and a raid from one place may warn other vendors at
other places of the impending threats. This is a more crude
form of the early warning system using mobile phones and
walkie talkies. Similar strategies have been reported among
street vendors in Brazil as well (Carrieri & Murta, 2011). What
has been demonstrated is that street vendors make use of the
network of relations among each other as a form of security
for each other. This form of security has been termed by Steel
(2012) as a "social security network." This security network of
relations among vendors is important to the well-being of
street vendors and to their continued survival on the streets.
Crossa (2009) demonstrates the importance of a social secu-
rity network through the following statement from one street
vendor:
. . . here I feel at home, like with my family. I mean that among
us we really help each other. There is more communication here
among us than in my own house where I just eat and sleep. This
is like one big family . . . (p. 52)
The statement above is a powerful indication of the impor-
tance of the network of relations and ties that exist among
street vendors. On the streets, therefore, social networks
become key to the survival and continued use of space for
street vendors. In relation to this, Milgram (2011) reasons that
by relying on social networks to survive and use city spaces,
street vendors turn absolute space into relational space.
Interestingly, these networks of relations go beyond fel-
low street vendors to include more formal shop owners who,
in different areas, have protected street vendors from city
authorities (Crossa, 2009; Milgram, 2011). In Mexico City,
for instance, Crossa (2009) writes, "Shop owners offered ref-
uge to their street vending allies when the police or authori-
ties arrived. In return, street vendors agreed to sell products
on the streets on behalf of shop owners" (p. 55). Social net-
works, thus, become important sources of power for street
vendors in negotiations.
Under continuous hostile regulatory circumstances
though, street vendors in different parts of the world have
also had to modify their mode of operation to sustain their
economic ventures. One of the most common of these strat-
egies is for otherwise stationary vendors to become more
mobile and to carry few goods with them to sell at any point
in time, a strategy that enhances an easy get away in case
city authorities approach, and ensures minimal losses in
case of confiscation of goods. In places like Baguio City in
the Philippines, Milgram (2011) explains that vendors
spread a few of their goods on blankets by the streets or on
pavements. This way, vendors argue that "if we are pursued
by the police, we can easily gather the four corners of our
blankets and run to prevent our produce from being confis-
cated" (Milgram, 2011, p. 280). In addition, Carrieri and
Murta (2011) writes of street vendors in Brazil that, as a
result of frequent inspections, vendors carried with them "a
minimal number of supplies to allow for a fast escape as
soon as inspectors were spotted to diminish possible losses"
(p. 221). This strategy has also been reported among street
vendors in Ghana, Mexico, and Peru (Anyimah-Ackah,
2007; Asiedu & Agyei-Mensah, 2008; Crossa, 2009;
Milgram, 2011; Solomon-Ayeh et al., 2011; Steel, 2012). In
Ghana, for instance, because there are usually high pedes-
trian traffic at the city center in Accra, vendors try to blend
in by carrying a few wares in their hands, just as if they were
pedestrians, but then announce to potential customers in a
bid to sell their items (Anyimah-Ackah, 2007). In Peru,
Steel (2012) also reports that female street vendors hide
their wares in their shopping bags and blend in with the
shoppers, creating the impression that they themselves were
shopping: "women selling painted gourds hid them in their
shopping bags to give the impression that they were shop-
ping rather than vending" (p. 1017). By being increasingly
mobile and constantly moving, vendors avoid drawing too
much attention to themselves and minimize the potential
losses in case city authorities arrest them. Elsewhere, some
vendors have completely changed trades and vended low-
value items, which offers less losses in case of confiscation
of goods (Steel, 2012).
Forkuor et al. 11
These strategies demonstrate vendors'innovativeness and
their abilities to adapt to the changing demands of their job.
Similar to more formal corporate entities who are continu-
ously finding innovative ways to become competitive, ven-
dors also modify their modes of operation in response to the
challenges posed by city authorities to have continuous
access to important urban spaces for business. What has been
made evident from the preceding is how street vendors rely
on individual agency as a way of sustaining their use of
urban public spaces. In a way, this is also a manifestation of
their personal form of power. Steel (2012) terms these indi-
vidual agency strategies as "strategies of resilience" mani-
fested by vendors in negotiating and using urban spaces.
Another important strategy that street vendors have used
in negotiating for and maintaining a space for business is to
anticipate the actions and inactions of regulators. Street ven-
dors in Baguio city in the northern Philippines, for instance,
may sell from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. in the morning, 12 p.m. to 1
p.m. in the afternoon, and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the evening
reflecting the times before the start of day, during lunch
break, and close of day when regulators are likely not to be
working actively (Milgram, 2011, p. 277). In the same way,
street vendors in Brazil, Belo Horizonte, have learnt to oper-
ate very early in the morning when regulators have not begun
work. Carrieri and Murta (2011) reveal that, "One of the
interviewees said that he works informally close to the bus
station in the morning; according to him, the inspectors are
not yet on the streets at that time" (p. 223). Street vendors in
Peru also adopt this strategy. By vending during the lunch-
time of regulators or during the evenings where control from
the state is minimal because regulators have closed from
work, "Other vendors told me that they try to sell their goods
while the municipal agents are eating lunch or dinner, or only
in the evenings when there is less control" (Steel, 2012, p.
1018). Turner and Schoenberger (2012) also find similar
strategies among street vendors in Vietnam.
What this means is that the knowledge of vendors regard-
ing the working culture of the context within which they
work serves as an important negotiating tool in negotiating
formal regulatory requirements.
Sometimes, space for business is negotiated for sustained
use through the payment of daily tokens, in money or in kind,
to city authorities and their field officials (Anjaria, 2006;
Milgram, 2011; Rajagopal, 2001). This remains one of the
most common negotiating strategies for street vendors in dif-
ferent parts of the world. In Mumbai, India, for instance,
street vendors sometimes have had to pay these tokens more
than once a day to operate in busy public spaces: "in busy
city areas, hawkers may be threatened 3 to 4 times a day by
city workers, paying up to 4500 rupees a month to keep them
at bay" (Rajagopal, 2001, p. 104). It must be emphasized
though that regulators and city authorities do not always
demand tokens. On the contrary, as vendors in Baguio city in
the northern Philippines have demonstrated, it is quite com-
mon for these tokens to be offered voluntarily in the form of
food products like fruits and cakes for city officials and
inspectors to enhance a vendor's stake or claim to a particu-
lar space of business. In Malawi, Kayuni and Tambulasi
(2009) write,
Several vendors explained that the police, who are supposed to
ensure that no one is plying their trade along the streets, are
sometimes very corrupt. The police are given K500.00 or more
and they allow these illegal street vendors to continue selling
their items discreetly. (p. 92)
Milgram (2011) also cites one vendor in the Philippines
as saying, "some officers even overlook our minor selling
infractions when we offer them sweet cooked rice cakes or
fruit to take home to their families" (p. 279). This practice
is also common among vendors in other African countries
(Mitullah, 2006), including Rwanda (Nzohabonimana,
2013), Angola (Redvers, 2014), Ghana (Asiedu & Agyei-
Mensah, 2008), and Malawi (Kayuni & Tambulasi, 2009).
Through the offering of these gifts and the payment of
tokens/bribes, relationships are negotiated and estab-
lished, and infringement of rules and regulations, includ-
ing the use of public spaces, is subsequently punished or
overlooked depending also on the quality of the relation-
ship (Milgram, 2011). Thus, vendors use the gifts they
give to regulators as a negotiating tool, a source of power
that allows them to influence the decision making of city
regulators.
Similar to Bass's revelation regarding the differences in
benefits that macro negotiating strategies have for different
groups based on sociodemographic characteristics, Steel
(2012) notices important differences among vendors in their
abilities to negotiate with urban officials and rework the sys-
tem. Steel (2012) finds that more established vendors had
more resources and abilities to negotiate, compared with new
vendors:
Established vendors have an extra repertoire of strategies with
which to confront insecurity and vulnerability. They have a
certain authority and status in the streets because they have
learned the secrets of street vending. They are entitled to the best
vending locations (i.e., those that are under a relatively low level
of surveillance by the municipality) and they have social
contacts in and off the street to escape from the hands of the
municipal agents. (p. 1018)
The revelations made by Bass (2000) and Steel (2012)
pose important questions about the benefits of these negoti-
ating strategies for different groups of street vendors. To
what extent do factors such as gender, age, geographical
location, time of vending, and time of year affect the negoti-
ating strategies of vendors? These important questions need
to be further explored through primary research studies, in
the continuous attempt to enhance the street vending sector
as a viable and legitimate source of employment and income
for urban residents in developing countries.

Conclusion
This article contributes by providing a coherent narrative and
a holistic picture of an otherwise fragmented literature base
on the dynamic relationship between street vendors and city
regulators. Perception has been demonstrated as a much more
fluid concept, changing with time and situation. Furthermore,
power emerges and exists in interaction, through informal
negotiations and strategies, through network of relations, and
through individual agency and innovative strategies. Power is
demonstrated here not only as a tool of oppression and
destruction but, with regard to vendors, as a tool for resistance
and resilience. Unlike other research studies, street vendors
have been demonstrated as an organized political force who,
through various strategies and approaches, resist or avoid the
power of city authorities and continue to use public spaces.
These strategies have been demonstrated as reflecting the
political power of street vendors in developing countries.
Because street vendors and regulators possess and use power
differently, this research emphasizes the need for these two
key stakeholders to collaborate and work together in enhanc-
ing the well-being of vendors and cities in general. We recom-
mend that future researchers further investigate in detail how
negotiations and strategies vary among different groups of
vendors vending in different public spaces. To what extent do
factors such as geographical location, time of vending (day-
time or night-time), time of year, gender, and age affect and
modify the negotiating strategies of vendors? These questions
must be explored through research to further deepen our
understanding of the negotiated setting of the street in devel-
oping countries.
