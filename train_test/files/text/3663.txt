Abstract
Background and aims: Clinical predictive models for stroke recovery could offer the opportunity of targeted early
intervention and more specific information for patients and carers. In this study, we developed and validated a patient-
specific prognostic model for monitoring recovery after stroke and assessed its clinical utility.
Methods: Four hundred and ninety-five patients from the population-based South London Stroke Register were
included in a substudy between 2002 and 2004. Activities of daily living were assessed using Barthel Index) at one,
two, three, four, six, eight, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after stroke. Penalized linear mixed models were developed to predict
patients' functional recovery trajectories. An external validation cohort included 1049 newly registered stroke patients
between 2005 and 2011. Prediction errors on discrimination and calibration were assessed. The potential clinical utility
was evaluated using prognostic accuracy measurements and decision curve analysis.
Results: Predictive recovery curves showed good accuracy, with root mean squared deviation of 3 Barthel Index points
and a R2 of 83% up to one year after stroke in the external cohort. The negative predictive values of the risk of poor
recovery (Barthel Index <8) at three and 12 months were also excellent, 96% (95% CI [93.6­97.4]) and 93% [90.8­95.3],
respectively, with a potential clinical utility measured by likelihood ratios (LRþ:17 [10.8­26.8] at three months and
LRþ:11 [6.5­17.2] at 12 months). Decision curve analysis showed an increased clinical benefit, particularly at threshold
probabilities of above 5% for predictive risk of poor outcomes.
Conclusions: A recovery curves tool seems to accurately predict progression of functional recovery in poststroke
patients.

Introduction
Stroke is the most common cause of adult physical dis-
ability and the third most common cause of death
worldwide.1­3 It is estimated that 25­74% of the 50
million stroke survivors worldwide require some assist-
ance or are dependent on caregivers for activities of
daily living.4­6
Despite the introduction of effective treatments for
acute stroke, early rehabilitation and secondary preven-
tion, the majority of stroke survivors have medical
comorbidities, physical, and/or cognitive impairments
that require ongoing active assessment and manage-
ment.3 Clinical prediction of the recovery is an import-
ant medical aim for the many people who survive
stroke. First, it could help early planning of rehabilita-
tion and longer term management. Second, it might
provide early warnings or triggers for those who fail
to recover as predicted. Third, knowing in advance
when a poor health outcome might occur would allow
survivors and their carers to plan accordingly.
Therefore, a practical and accurate tool to assist in pre-
dicting functional recovery after stroke at patient level
could provide significant aid for patient management
and cost of health delivery.7,8 Furthermore, a predic-
tion model of functional recovery trajectory can be

Recent published prognostic tools for stroke func-
tional recovery include the ASTRAL (90% accuracy
for classifying modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 2 at
three months),9 the PLAN score (89% accuracy for
predicting mortality and mRS 5­6 combined at dis-
charge),10 six simple variables model (84% accuracy
for mortality and mRS < 3 combined at six
months),11 and the iScore (79% accuracy for mortality
or mRS 3­5 combined at 30 days).12 However, these
studies used predictions for one specific time point
which does not allow for the complexity of changes of
functional recovery over time or for the variety of con-
founders that may alter the functional recovery trajec-
tory. Furthermore, they do not distinguish between
whether higher functional ability is due to an overall
improved functional ability that is already present at
the early stage, or due to improved functional recovery
over time, or due to both. Thus, they have limited util-
ity for clinical applications which require ongoing
active assessment and monitoring of stroke patients.
Stroke recovery is a complex process in its nature,
and individual functional recovery patterns differ
across subpopulations and time.13 Current practice
makes use of clinicians' expert judgments based on a
number of factors at the onset such as age, stroke sever-
ity, consciousness, and stroke subtype. A recovery
curve predictive model could potentially provide an
equivalent prognostic tool that could support deci-
sion-making process at any time after stroke. Detailed
longitudinal data and methods may be more appropri-
ate to accurately capture stroke recovery with the aim
of designing a tool that could assist in planning imme-
diate and midterm care for individual patients.14,15
Several studies have hypothetically suggested that
recovery of body function and activities could be pre-
dictable after stroke.14­16 In this study, we developed
and validated a novel patient-specific predictive model
of functional stroke recovery trajectories over time and
evaluated its clinical utility.
Materials and methods
Case ascertainment
Four hundred and ninety-five patients from the
ongoing population-based South London Stroke
Register (SLSR) between the period August 2002 and
October 2004 were included in the development cohort.
One hundred and forty-nine new patients registered
between August 2005 and October 2011 were included
in the validation cohort. The methods of the SLSR data
collection have been described previously in detail5,17
and are summarized here. All patients with a first
ever stroke after 1 January 1995 and residing in a
defined inner-city area of South London were eligible
to be registered into the prospective, ongoing register.
According to the 2011 Census this area (northern parts
of Southwark and Lambeth; n ¼ 357,308) comprises a
distinctly multiethnic population with a large propor-
tion of black Caribbean and African residents (25.3%).
Stroke was defined according to WHO definition of
stroke.18 Case ascertainment was estimated as 88%
complete by a multinominal-logit capture­recapture
model.5
Outcome measure and prognostic indicators
of functional recovery
The functional recovery was evaluated using Barthel
Index (BI)19 with total possible scores range from 0 to
20, with lower scores indicating increased disability. BI
was measured at weeks one, two, three, four, six, eight,
12, 26, and 52 after stroke. In the development cohort,
patients were followed for a mean duration of 28.5
weeks and were measured on a mean of five occasions
(range 1­9). Patients with fewer than two observations
(n ¼ 31) were excluded from the modeling procedure.
The external temporal cohort includes data of 1049
newly registered stroke patients between 2005 and
2011 with Barthel measured at up to three time
points, one, 12, and 52 weeks. The final model was
built using 2416 observations across 462 patients from
the development cohort. All potential predictors of
functional recovery were considered in the model vari-
able selection, including demographics (age, sex, ethni-
city, premorbid disability, socioeconomic status),
stroke characteristics (subtype based on the Oxford
classification (lacunar infarct (LACI), total anterior cir-
culation infarcts (TACI), partial anterior circulation
infarcts (PACI), posterior circulation infarcts (POCI),
and hemorrhagic stroke), presence of cerebellar symp-
toms, case-mix variables (Glasgow coma score (GCS),
NIH stroke scale (NIHSS)).20 These predictors were
screened for practicality based on their clinical avail-
ability, ease of measurement, prevalence in academic
literature, and on biological reasoning, resulting in a
set of candidate prognostic factors.
Model development and validation
Penalized mixed models21 were adapted to develop
recovery trajectories model which predicts the func-
tional recovery for a patient with the selected prognos-
tic factors. An additional inverse square root term of
time was included into the model as it significantly
increased the prediction of the recovery model.
Repeated random subsampling cross-validation meth-
ods were used to select best competing models and

model parameter.22 Missing values were imputed using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.23 Leave-one-out
cross-validation was used to assess the performance of
the developed prognostic recovery curve model. R2,
absolute mean error, and root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) were considered together to estimate the pre-
dictive error in both, the development and the external
validation cohorts. Patient age, sex, NIHSS, GCS
(dichotomized: 15; or less than 15), stroke subtype
(LACI, PACI, POCI, TACI, hemorrhage), and inter-
actions between predictor variables and the inverse
square root term of time in weeks were identified as
good independent predictors of recovery over time.
The resulting multivariable model of predicted BI is
described in the online material (Appendix 1).
Clinical utility
We plotted recovery curve trajectories to visually
inspect different well-defined at-risk subgroups.
Average predicted recovery patterns were analyzed by
age, stroke subtype, GCS, and NIHSS.16 To assess the
prognostic effectiveness and clinical utility of predicted
recovery curves to identify different functional out-
comes at different time points, we dichotomized func-
tional recovery using three thresholds (8, 12, and 17).
These thresholds correspond to poor outcome if BI < 8
(representing complete dependence on others), good
outcome if BI > 12 (transition from complete depend-
ence to assisted independence), and independence if
BI > 17 (representing independence with minor assist-
ance as could be reasonably provided in a community
setting).24 We then evaluated the clinical utility at these
thresholds of the predicted recovery curves to classify
good, poor, and independent outcome at both three
and 12 months. These were evaluated in the external
cohort using area under the receiver operator curves for
discrimination and using calibration plot and Hosmer­
Lemeshow test for calibration.
Decision curve analysis (DCA)25,26 method was per-
formed in order to evaluate further the clinical useful-
ness of recovery curves in prognostication of poor
outcome at both three and 12 months. DCA is a
method to assess the added value of information pro-
vided by a prognostic test across a range of a patient's
risks and benefits to facilitate clinical decisions, without
the need for actually measuring these for individual
patients. The DCA is expressed graphically as a
curve, with the clinical net benefit on the vertical axis
and probability thresholds on the horizontal axis.
The net benefit of prediction models was then evaluated
by adding the benefits (true positives) and subtracting
the harms (false positives). The weight assigned to true
positives and false positives was derived from the
threshold probability of the outcome. When the curve
is at its highest over the range of probability thresholds,
the associated intervention would be the best decision.
Ethics
Patients, or for patients with communication problems
their relatives, gave written informed consent to
participate in stroke-related studies within the SLSR.
The design was approved by the ethics committees of
Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Kings
College Hospital, Queens Square, and Westminster
Hospitals (London).
Results
Of the 462 patients in the development cohort, 113 died
(24.4%) during the study. The study population con-
sisted of 252 females (50.9%). Average age was 71 years
(range 22­98 years). The external temporal validation
cohort has similar characteristics (Table 1).
The predictive recovery curves showed an excellent
fit and prediction. In the internal cross-validation, pre-
dictive error RMSD over all time points was 3 BI
points, mean absolute error 2 BI points, and a R2 of
77%. Predictive accuracy of the model was also good in
the external validation cohort with a RMSD of 2.83 BI
points, mean absolute error of 1.72 BI points, and a R2
of 83%. Figure 1 presents the average predicted recov-
ery patterns with comparison to the average observed
BI after stroke.
Average recovery was characterized by a steep
increase in BI over the first eight weeks followed by a
more gradual period of recovery reaching its apex at
around 12 weeks. Depending on patient characteristics
considered in the model, predictive curves showed
peaks ranging from 8 to 32 weeks. Recovery was inver-
sely associated with NIHSS and age, and had a positive
association with GCS. Subtype had a variable influence
on recovery, with POCI and LACI showing the most
immediate ($8 weeks) recovery with the highest, and
roughly equivalent, peaks. Hemorrhage and PACI
showed the next quickest and complete recovery, by
12 weeks. TACI showed longer spontaneous neuro-
logical recovery, peaking at around 32 weeks and a
marked decline subsequently. Figure 2 presents recov-
ery patterns after stroke stratified by age group, stroke
subtype, GCS, and NIHSS.
Recovery curve models were further evaluated to
define a set of rules with appropriate sensitivity and
specificity to usefully identify patients with poor recov-
ery patterns. Figure 3 presents discrimination and cali-
bration analyses of predicting functional outcomes at
three and 12 months in the temporal external validation
cohort. The sensitivity and specificity in the external val-
idation at three months were excellent: 71 [58.8­81.3]

and 96 [93.6­97.4] for poor outcome, 88 [84.3­90.7]
and 82 [73.7­89.0] for good outcome, and 80 [74.9­
83.7] and 83 [77.2­87.9] for community independence.
The model has shown also potential utility, expressed
by predictive values for the risk of poor outcomes. The
negative predictive values of recovery curves were over
90% for poor outcome, 96% [93.6­97.4] and 93% [90.8­
95.3] at three and 12 months, respectively. Table 2 pre-
sents predictive values and likelihood ratios for classify-
ing each functional outcome of interest.
The net benefit as a function of a threshold probabil-
ity of poor outcomes at three and 12 months was illu-
strated in Figure 4. The gray line was drawn to reflect
the strategy of ``assume all patients have poor out-
comes'' (i.e. recommend intervention for all), and the
black line was drawn to reflect the strategy of ``assume
all patients would have good outcomes'' (i.e. do not
recommend any intervention). As expected, these two
lines cross at the prevalence of poor outcome, 13% for
three months and 11% for 12 months. The net benefit
was maximized by the recovery curves predictive model
(dash line) with threshold probabilities of 5­71% at
three months and 7­57% at 12 months. For higher
thresholds (>71% for three months or >57% for 12
months) where the concerns are more about unneces-
sary interventions than missed prognosis, the option to
not intervene was preferred. In this case, strategies
aided by recovery curves prediction have no value.
Discussion
In this study, we have developed and validated a
dynamic patient-specific prognostic tool of functional
recovery poststroke in a population-based cohort. The
proposed patient-centered model is the first that enables
recovery to be predicted using a continuous score,
derived from a combination of individual patient char-
acteristics, and makes available adjusted functional

the accuracy of this model has been shown to be super-

Patterns of functional recovery in a general unbiased
stroke population demonstrate sharp improvements in
the first weeks after stroke and then plateau. Patients
with varying severity, different stroke subtype, and risk
factors experience different recovery courses that plat-
eaued at different levels and time. Although the general
pattern of recovery from stroke, including functional
and neurological impairments, has already been dis-
cussed and illustrated at population level in previous
studies,14,27 our proposed model is patient specific
and has additionally provided the ability to predict
accurately recovery trajectories up to one year post-
stroke. This could be useful for early rehabilitation
and discharge planning, by predicting whether a patient
is likely to be dependent, require some assistance, or be
independent, at a certain time poststroke. To give a
practical example, when considering functional
recovery shortly after admission, the predictive recov-
ery curves show similarities between hemorrhage and
TACI stroke but large differences three months later;
conversely, dissimilarities were observed between hem-
orrhage and PACI at the baseline but recovery after
three months was comparable. This could be explained
by the different rate of recovery between stroke types
and reconfirms that survivors of hemorrhagic stroke
have a greater chance for recovering function than
those who suffer ischemic stroke as suggested in previ-
ous studies.28 Another case that we have tested is when
patients have different, or combinations of risk factors,
clearly distinct trajectories with different recovery rates
can be expected and we can begin to predict poor func-
tional outcomes. For instance, we have shown that
changes in recovery do not vary between different age
groups. There was a sharp initial increase in recovery
which plateaued earlier in younger patients compared
to older ones. But despite the slow recovery rate
observed in old patients, we would expect improvement

to the same level as that of younger patients. This
would suggest that specialized stroke rehabilitation
may be beneficial for all ages. It also confirms that
older patients may need longer rehabilitation and are
less likely to be discharged earlier. Interestingly, the
change in recovery rate in severe stroke (poor GCS or
NIHSS at onset) showed inverse relationship with
recovery. This suggests that apart from old age, factors
such as onset stroke severity should also be taken into con-
sideration when planning interventions and rehabilitation
after stroke. Therefore, this patient-specific recovery curve
pattern prediction could potentially inform tailored dis-
charge planning for stroke survivors including those with
``hidden'' impairments that have not been recognized by
the medical team, for example in patients with communi-
cation problems. It could also be used to provide early
warning of the development of stroke sequelae, such as
medical complications, poorly managed risk factors, or
inadequate rehabilitation. Evidence from a recent system-
atic qualitative review29 showed that rehabilitation could
be improved by fostering patients' autonomy through
genuinely patient-centered care and more effective com-
munication and information. Recovery curve predictions
may playan important role not only to risks of poor recov-
ery identification, but also to inform a joint physician­
patient decision making for effective delivery of preventive
and therapeutic interventions.
Generally, subjects' stratification is often based on
one characteristic variable at a specific time point, such
as stroke severity at the onset of stroke, which may

limit the clinical utility of their predictiveness. We have
shown that using a dynamic (time-dependent) multi-
variate patient-specific predictive model, we can make
individual recovery profiles and accurately classify
future risks of outcomes. By maintaining this accuracy
in differing patient populations, we believe that the
recovery curve model is sufficiently robust and DCAs
suggest it may be used clinically.
Although the general pattern of recovery from stroke,
including functional and neurological impairments, has
already been discussed and illustrated in previous stu-
dies,14,27 our proposed model has additionally provided
the ability to predict at any time the recovery of individ-
uals up to one year poststroke. These patient-specific
recovery curves predictions could allow more insight
into both spontaneous and directed neurological recovery
after stroke. Practically, this could offer the potential to
use recovery curves to chart an individual's recovery and
identify when and why there is significant variance from
the normal population curve in much the same way as
normal growth curves are used to monitor the develop-
ment of children. This prognostic information is import-
ant for clinicians, stroke survivors, and their carers.
In clinical research, this could also be applied as an
aid in assessing the beneficial effects of evidence-based
interventions and care settings. As a research tool, this
could be used to test novel interventions or to identify
enriched samples, reducing the reliance on the need for
expensive and often impractical randomized controlled
trials. This predictive enrichment strategy is of import-
ance for designing future trials as it enables the enroll-
ment of the most suitable patients thereby permitting
the use of a smaller study population. Another poten-
tial application could be to derive a set of preliminary
cost weights on resource uses which could help to build
personalized patient care and funding models.
A key strength of the current study is that the models
were built and externally validated using a prospective
unbiased population-based cohort of first ever strokes.
This is preferable over a hospital-based population,
which may result in case-mix-specific models, or over
aggregate data from clinical trials, which usually repre-
sent selected patients, and thus nonrepresentative popu-
lations. Notwithstanding, the study could be
strengthened further if the model were to be validated
in a completely independent holdout population in dif-
ferent poststroke care setting, preferably from another
country. A limitation of this study is the effectiveness
and usefulness of recovery curves as a low-cost predic-
tive-based intervention still needs to be confirmed. An
impact study needs to be conducted in a randomized
control trial (RCT) setting to confirm whether being
able to predict recovery and the resulting intervention
could make a difference to the patient. Nevertheless, the
current pilot study has now allowed us to recognize
how recovery curves could be implemented and
planned for use in stroke care. Estimates and variations
from this study will serve to inform the design of the
RCT study on how recovery curves and its software as
a management tool could improve functional recovery.
Conclusion
Prognostic risk classification based on recovery curves
can be clinically useful. This tool makes prognostic
information available which could support the develop-
ment of more tailored management and assist the
implementation of more effective care models.
Recovery curves tool could provide a useful framework
for clinical and public health practice.
