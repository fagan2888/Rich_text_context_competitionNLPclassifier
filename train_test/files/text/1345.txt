2003; 254: 540­547.
Objective. To determine functional limitations in
adults with obstructive or restrictive lung disease or
respiratory symptoms.
Design. Cross-sectional study.
Subjects. Adult participants in phase 2 of the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
1991­94.
Methods. We classified subjects using spirometric
criteria into the following mutually exclusive
categories using the forced expiratory volume in
1 s (FEV1
), the forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV1
/
FVC ratio and the presence of respiratory symptoms:
severe obstruction, moderate obstruction, mild
obstruction, respiratory symptoms only, restrictive
lung disease and no lung disease. We developed
regression models to predict functional limitations
(unable to walk a quarter of a mile, unable to lift
10 pounds, needs help with daily activities) that
controlled for age, race, sex, education, smoking
status, body mass index and comorbid conditions.
Results. Severe and moderate obstruction were
associated with an increased risk of being unable
to walk a quarter of a mile [odds ratio (OR) 8.4, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 19.9 and OR 2.4, 95%
CI 1.4, 4.0]. Restrictive lung disease and the
presence of respiratory symptoms in the absence of
lung function impairment were also associated with
an increased risk of this outcome (OR 2.8, 95% CI
1.4, 5.6 and OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.0, 3.9). Similar
results were obtained for the outcomes of being
unable to lift 10 pounds or needing help with daily
activities.
Conclusions. The presence of obstructive or restrict-
ive lung disease, or respiratory symptoms in the
absence of lung function impairment is associated
with increased functional impairment.
Keywords: functional limitation, health status, lung
function, obstructive lung disease, restrictive lung
disease, respiratory symptoms, spirometry.
Introduction
Both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
and restrictive lung diseases are important causes of
morbidity and mortality in the US [1, 2]. Morbidity
from chronic respiratory disease includes not only
hospitalizations and emergency department visits,
but also restricted activity and functional limitations
[1].
Both diagnosed and undiagnosed obstructive lung
disease are known to be associated with increased
functional limitation [3]. In a recently published
analysis of data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), Coul-
tas et al. found that undiagnosed airflow obstruction
was associated with impaired health and functional
status. However, that analysis did not look at indi-
viduals with restrictive lung disease or respiratory

symptoms, and these subjects were included in the
referent group that did not have obstructive lung
disease. Restrictive lung disease can have a variety
of aetiologies, including diseases such as muscular
weakness, congestive heart failure, interstitial lung
disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity, all of which
can also be associated with increased limitation and
morbidity [4­8]. In addition, respiratory symptoms
such as chronic cough or sputum production may
have their own significant morbidities [9, 10].
Spirometric criteria were applied to define
obstructive and restrictive lung disease in adults
who had pulmonary function measurements
obtained as part of phase 2 of NHANES III. In
addition, a group of subjects who reported respirat-
ory symptoms in the absence of lung function
impairment were assessed. Then the relationship
between impaired lung function and respiratory
symptoms with reported functional limitations and
self-reported health status, controlling for potential
covariates that may also influence these measures,
was assessed.
Methods
Study population
The NHANES III was conducted in two nationally
representative phases from 1988 to 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA
[11]. In this study a stratified multistage clustered
probability design was used to select a representative
sample of the US population, yielding results which
can be extrapolated to the noninstitutionalized
civilian US population. Study participants completed
extensive questionnaires in the household and a
comprehensive physical examination, including pul-
monary function testing, either in the household or
at a specially equipped mobile examination centre.
The study was approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics' Institutional Review Board.
Subjects and demographics
The study sample was limited to adults aged
17 years and older who participated in phase 2 of
NHANES III (1991­94) and who had pulmonary
function testing performed in either the household
or the mobile examination centre, and had complete
data on their race, smoking status, body mass index,
functional status and presence of respiratory symp-
toms. Functional status was not available for all
adults in phase 1 of NHANES III, so the analysis was
limited to phase 2 participants. Of the 9930 adult
survey participants in phase 2 of NHANES III, 802
did not undergo medical examination, 687 did not
undergo pulmonary function testing, 155 were
pregnant, 659 were missing data on function
limitations and 124 were missing data on other
variables. After the exclusions, data from 7503
(75.6%) subjects were available for the main ana-
lysis.
Variable definition
The race of the participants was classified as `White',
`African-American', `Mexican-American' or `Other'
and was determined by self-report on the question-
naire. Other demographic covariates included sex,
education (£11, 12 or 13 years) and age. The
subjects were stratified into four age strata: 17­44,
45­64, 65­74 and 75 years and older. The body
mass index was calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in metres and
the following classifications were used: <18.5,
18.5­24, 25­29 and 30 kg m)2. The subjects
were defined as being current smokers, former
smokers, pipe or cigar smokers, or never smokers,
based on their responses to series of questions.
Current pipe or cigar smokers were considered
`current smokers'. One had to have smoked at least
100 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 3 ounces of pipe
tobacco to qualify as a former or current smoker.
The subjects were classified as having a respirat-
ory symptom when they gave a positive response to
any one of the following questions involving specific
symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze and dyspnoea):
`Do you usually cough on most days for 3 consecu-
tive months or more during the year?'; `Do you bring
up phlegm on most days for 3 consecutive months
or more during the year?'; `Have you had wheezing
or whistling in your chest at any time in the past
12 months?' and `Are you troubled by shortness of
breath when hurrying on level ground or walking
up a slight hill?' The subjects were classified as
having or not having: cardiovascular disease (pos-
itive response to physician diagnosed myocardial
infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure);
diabetes mellitus (positive response to physician

diagnosis of diabetes mellitus) or arthritis (positive
response to physician diagnosis of osteoarthritis or
rheumatoid arthritis).
Pulmonary function data
Using either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the
mobile examination centre or a portable spirometer
in the household examination, spirometry was
conducted on the examinees. Procedures for testing
were based on the 1987 American Thoracic Society
recommendations [12]. In order to obtain curves
acceptable according to the protocol, examinees
performed five to eight forced expirations. Subjects
were excluded from this analysis if they either did
not perform spirometry or had results that were not
reliable. Values used in this analysis included the
forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory
volume in 1 s (FEV1
) and the FEV1
/FVC ratio. The
predicted values of FEV1
and FVC were determined
using previously published prediction equations
[13]. The sex-specific model for white participants
was applied to people of `Other' race. The subjects
were classifed using a modification of the global
initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease
(GOLD) criteria for COPD into the following mutu-
ally exclusive categories using the FEV1
, the FVC,
the FEV1
/FVC ratio, and the presence of respiratory
symptoms: severe COPD (FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and
FEV1
< 50% predicted), moderate COPD (FEV1
/
FVC < 0.70 and FEV1
 50 to <80% predicted),
mild COPD (FEV1
/FVC < 0.70 and FEV1
 80%),
symptoms only (presence of respiratory symptoms in
the absence of any lung function abnormality),
restrictive lung disease (FEV1
/FVC  0.70 and
FVC < 80% predicted) and no lung disease [14].
Functional limitation and reported health status
Functional limitations were determined based on
self-response to questions asking whether they had
`no difficulty, some difficulty, much difficulty or are
unable to do certain activities'. Limitations included
walking for a quarter of a mile and lifting or
carrying something as heavy as 10 pounds and
considered any reported difficulty as a limitation.
Subjects were also asked `Because of any impair-
ment or health problem, do you need the help of
other persons in handling routine needs, such as
everyday household chores, doing necessary busi-
ness, shopping or getting around for other purpo-
ses?' and a positive response was considered as a
limitation. Subjects categorized their general health
status as `excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor'
and we stratified the responses into fair or poor
versus good or better.
Analysis
All estimates were calculated using the sampling
weight to represent adults aged 17 years and older
in the US. The purpose of these sampling weights
was to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection
and to account for nonresponse. All percentages
shown are weighted and age-adjusted to the distri-
bution of participants in the final analytic sample.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models were developed to describe the relationship
between impaired lung function and respiratory
symptoms with functional limitation or health
status. Multivariate models adjusted for age, sex,
race, smoking status, body mass index and comorbid
chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease,
models were evaluated for interaction by the cova-
riates. Both SAS and SUDAAN, a program that
adjusts for the complex sample design when calcu-
lating variance estimates [15, 16], were used in this
analysis.
Results
The final data set comprised 7503 subjects repre-
senting an estimated 165 million adults in the US.
The 2427 adults not included in the final analytic
sample because of missing data were older than the
participants (mean age 48.8 years vs. 42.2 years,
P < 0.05) and more likely to be female (55.0% vs.
51.5%, P < 0.05) or former smokers (28.3% vs.
23.4%, P < 0.05).
The pulmonary function criteria classified 1.3%
of subjects as having severe COPD, 5.1% as having
moderate COPD, 6.8% as having mild COPD, 6.6%
as having restrictive lung disease, and 23.4%
having respiratory symptoms in the absence of
lung function impairment (Table 1). The propor-
tion of subjects with moderate or severe COPD was
higher in older age groups and current or former
smokers (Table 1). The proportion of subjects with
restrictive lung disease was higher in older age
groups and people with diabetes mellitus, but not

in current or former smokers (Table 1). The
proportion of subjects with moderate or severe
COPD in this analysis (6.4%) was similar to the
proportion (6.8%) found in a previous analysis of
the larger NHANES II phase 1 and 2 data sets [17].
Prevalence of functional limitations and reported
fair or poor health status are shown in Table 2. The
reported prevalence of most of these indicators were
higher in older age groups, in the presence of
chronic comorbid conditions, amongst African-
Americans and Mexican-Americans, amongst
women and amongst current smokers.
In univariate models, all strata of impaired lung
function or respiratory symptoms were associated
with a higher odds ratio (OR) of functional limitation,
or fair or poor health status (Table 3). Significant
interactions between measures of lung function
impairment and other covariates were not detected.

measures of functional impairment and a fair or
poor health status. Whilst severe COPD had the
highest OR of limitations, moderate COPD, restrict-
ive lung disease and respiratory symptoms in the
absence of impaired lung function were all associ-
ated with a higher OR of functional limitations and a
fair or poor health status to a similar extent.
The prior analysis of this database restricted the
analysis to white participants 45-years old and
focused only on obstructive lung disease as the
outcome of interest [3]. In that analysis the
comparison group of `normal' subjects included
people with both restrictive lung disease and respir-
atory symptoms, which could have resulted in
underestimating the effect of COPD on functional
limitations or health status. For example, in the
prior analysis the multivariate regression model for
fair or poor health status amongst subjects with
Stage II or III COPD (roughly corresponding to
severe COPD category of the present study) yielded
an OR of 2.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 5.8]
whereas the present analysis yielded an OR of 5.3
(95% CI 2.0, 13.6), with similar findings for the
other end-points [3]. Similarly, none of the models in
the prior analysis amongst subjects with Stage 1b
COPD (roughly corresponding to moderate COPD
category of the present study) were associated with
an increased risk of limitations, whereas all the
present models, with the exception of `Needs help
with daily activities' were.
The finding that restrictive lung disease is asso-
ciated with a higher OR of functional limitations and
fair or poor health status is expected. Restriction on
spirometry can be related to a variety of aetiologies,
including interstitial lung disease, obesity, muscular
weakness and small airways disease [4, 18, 19]. The
precise determination of restriction requires the
measurement of total lung capacity [20] although
others have shown that most patients with restric-
tion on spirometry have this confirmed when the
total lung capacity is measured [21]. In addition, it
is possible that subjects with `normal' lung function
who did not complete the test were included in the
`restrictive' category. This bias could have the
potential to underestimate functional limitation
amongst subjects with restrictive disease [22].
A surprising finding was that people reporting
respiratory symptoms in the absence of lung func-
tion impairment also reported fair or poor health
status, or functional limitations at a level similar to
that seen in moderate COPD. In the GOLD criteria for
COPD the presence of respiratory symptoms in the
absence of lung function impairment is considered
Stage 0 COPD, with the recommended intervention
being `information and advice about reducing risk
factors' [14]. The data suggest that some of these

LUNG DISEASE AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION 545
people may have significant limitations related to
these symptoms, with the possibility that they might
benefit from interventions for chronic cough or
sputum production or aimed at the underlying
aetiology of their symptoms [23]. `Respiratory'
symptoms, particularly dyspnoea on exertion, may
also be related to diagnosed or undiagnosed cardio-
vascular disease. Although diagnosed cardiovascu-
lar disease was controlled for in this analysis (and a
higher proportion of subjects with diagnosed disease
had respiratory symptoms in the absence of lung
function impairment, Table 1), it is possible that
undiagnosed cardiovascular disease may be related
to both the presence of respiratory symptoms and
the reporting of functional limitations [10].
Another somewhat surprising finding was the
high proportion of subjects with lung function
impairment who did not report functional limita-
tions. For example, only 18% of subjects with severe
COPD reported they were unable to walk a quarter
of a mile (Table 2). This paradox can be explained,
in part, by age-adjustment, which weighted the
results towards the younger participants. In non
age-adjusted results, 45.5% of subjects with severe
COPD reported being unable to walk a quarter of a
mile, but these were over represented amongst the
older subjects. It is still likely, however, that people
underreport functional limitations.
This analysis has some limitations. As a cross-
sectional study, it could not determine whether the
lung function impairment or respiratory symptoms
actually led to the higher level of functional limita-
tions. This is particularly true with regard to
respiratory symptoms; it is possible that people
reporting more respiratory symptoms report many
things, including functional limitations, more fre-
quently. Over 20% of the eligible sample was
missing data on either covariates or outcomes and
was excluded from the analysis. Those excluded
tended to be older and, presumably, sicker, than
those included, so findings may actually underesti-
mate the extent of limitation associated with lung
function impairment or respiratory symptoms.
In conclusion, this analysis finds that obstructive
lung disease, restrictive lung disease and respirat-
ory symptoms are all associated with a significantly
higher risk of functional impairment and fair or
poor health status. A large proportion of lung
disease is undiagnosed in the US, which has led to
initiatives such as the National Lung Health
Education Program that promote more widespread
use of spirometry in primary care settings [24, 25].
Although the main objective of this programme is
the early detection of COPD, spirometry would also
detect restrictive lung disease, which would require
further clinical evaluation and treatment. In addi-
tion, this analysis highlights the importance of
chronic respiratory symptoms that may be amen-
able to clinical interventions or considered in
studies looking at functional limitations as end-
points.
