Objectives. In the past decade, there has been increasing interest in regional differences in attitudes and behaviors;
however, little of this research has focused on families, particularly in later life. The goal of this article is to address two
specific questions: (a) Does adult children's closeness and contact with mothers vary by region? and (b) Can traditionalism
explain patterns of regionality?
Methods. To address these questions, we used a subsample of adult children (aged 25­74) from the National Survey of
Families and Households (Wave II) who were asked about contact and closeness with their mothers (aged 65 and older).
Results. Adult children residing in the South reported greater contact and closeness with mothers than those residing in
other parts of the country. Traditionalism regarding gender ideology and religious involvement could not account for the
greater contact and closeness observed among Southern respondents.
Discussion. Recent literature has demonstrated the persistence of a distinctive Southern culture; the present study
contributes to this body of work by showing that intergenerational cohesion is also greater in the South than in other regions
of the United States. These findings call for greater attention to regionality in future studies of intergenerational relations.
ACROSS the past decade, there has been a resurgence of
interest in comparing the American South to other regions
of the country (DiMaggio, Evans, & Bryson, 1996; Hurlbert &
Bankston, 1998; Powers et al., 2003; Rice & Coates, 1995;
Suitor & Carter, 1999; Suitor & Reavis, 1995; Twenge, 1997).
Much of this work has focused on the traditional values and
behaviors that compose ``Southern culture.'' Although the fam-
ily is generally considered to be a cornerstone of traditionalism,
it has received little attention in the study of regional differences.
In the present study, we began to examine this issue by focusing
on one of the most enduring of family relations--that between
mothers and adult children. To this end, we used data from the
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to
investigate whether mother­adult-child closeness and contact
differ between the South and other regions of the United States.
Furthermore, we examined whether other dimensions of
traditionalism can explain patterns of regionality in mother­
adult-child relations.
Studies across the past three decades have shown evidence
of regional differences, the strongest and most consistent of
which have been between the South and all other regions of
the United States. In particular, Southerners are expected, both
by themselves and by non-Southerners, to be more sociable
and religious (Hackney, 2005; J. Reed, 2004; J. S. Reed, 1972,
1993; Silk, 2005; Suitor & Carter, 1999) and more traditional
regarding both moral issues and gender roles (Powers et al.,
2003; Rice & Coates, 1995; Suitor & Carter, 1999; Suitor &
Reavis, 1995; Twenge, 1997). Although writers on the South
have noted the strong role of the family in Southern culture (cf.
Hackney, 2005; Hurlbert, 1989; J. Reed, 2004; J. S. Reed,
1972, 1993), empirical studies have focused primarily on other
dimensions of traditional values and behaviors (DiMaggio
et al., 1996; Powers et al., 2003; Rice & Coates, 1995; Suitor &
Carter, 1999; Suitor & Reavis, 1995). However, given the
strong relationship between other dimensions of traditionalism
and familism (Becker, 1991; Booth & Amato, 1994; Marks &
McLanahan, 1993), it stands to reason that the same trend in
regional differences regarding other aspects of traditionalism,
such as those regarding gender and religion, would be found in
family relations. Therefore, we hypothesized that relations be-
tween mothers and their adult children would be more cohesive
in the South than in other regions of the country.
As discussed previously, we believe that closer parent­adult-
child relations among Southerners is primarily a manifestation
of greater traditionalism in the South across a variety of issues,
including religion, gender-role attitudes, and attitudes regarding
social issues more generally. If this is the case, the association
between region and parent­child relations should weaken or
disappear completely when controlling on such measures of
traditionalism. However, this may not be the case if familism
varies by region apart from other dimensions of traditionalism.
Carter and Borch's (2005) recent analysis of regional differ-
ences in gender-role attitudes suggests that, in fact, this might
be the case. They found that even after controlling on reli-
giosity, religious attendance, and education--three strong pre-
dictors of traditionalism--region continued to exert an effect
on gender-role attitudes. These findings suggest that there
may be dimensions of Southern culture that function beyond
effects of other characteristics common to the South. Rather
than developing specific hypotheses regarding the independent
effects of region on parent­adult-child closeness and contact,
we explored this question.

In summary, we hypothesized that closeness and contact
between mothers and adult children would be stronger in the
South than in other regions of the United States. We also ex-
plored the association between region and mother­child rela-
tionship quality and how dimensions of traditionalism mediate
this relationship.
METHODS
Data
The data for this study were a subsample of Wave II of the
NSFH (NSFH2, 1992­1994; Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The
NSFH used a national stratified, multistage area probability
sample collected from both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan
areas (Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The NSFH is a nationally
representative sample of adults, all of whom were asked about
their relationships with their living parents (Wave II n ¼
10,008). The NSFH2 provides the best opportunity to study
regional differences in parent­adult-child relations for two
reasons. First, because regional differences have become more
muted across time (Powers et al., 2003; Twenge, 1997), we
wanted to use the most recent data available; thus, NSFH2
was preferable to NSFH1. Additionally, given the concern
with recency, NSFH3 might have been the most ideal for our
study; however, the substantial attrition between T2 and T3
reduced the number of respondents with living parents below
the threshold we believed was reasonable for analysis.
The subsample for the present study included all members of
the original sample with (a) mothers alive and older than age 65
and (b) data on both contact and closeness with mothers (n ¼
2,502). The analysis focused on parent­child relations from the
adult child's perspective. We chose to focus on mothers rather
than both parents because in families in which parents were
alive and living together, the NSFH2 asked adult children about
their contact with mothers only. Because contact with mothers
and fathers, even when coresidential, differs substantially
(Lawton, Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994), we felt that it would
be inappropriate to use contact with mothers as a surrogate for
contact with fathers.
Sample Characteristics
Characteristics of adult children. --The respondents were
between the ages of 25 and 79 (M¼45.4, SD¼8.7). In all, 66%
were married. With regard to education, 11% had less than
a high school education, 32% had a high school diploma or
equivalent, 19% had some college, and 38% were college
graduates. A total of 60% were women. Finally, 81% were
White, 13% were Black, and 6% were non-White Hispanic.
Characteristics of mothers. --The mothers were between the
ages of 65 and 101 (M ¼ 73.6, SD ¼ 7.0). In all, 45% were
married, and 46% were widowed. With regard to education,
37% had less than a high school education, 40% had a high
school diploma or equivalent, 11% had some college, and 12%
were college graduates.
Dependent Variables
The respondents were asked about multiple aspects of their
relationships with their mothers. For the purposes of this article,
we used measures of frequency of contact and closeness with
mothers. Contact was measured by two questions asking how
many times during the past 12 months the respondent had seen
his or her mother or communicated by letter or phone with her.
Answers to these questions ranged on a 6-point scale, where 0¼
not at all and 5 ¼ more than once a week. We used these two
questions to create a single contact measure. To do this, we
used the highest response to either measure as the respondent's
score. Thus, for example, if a respondent reported that she had
seen her mother once a month and also reported that she had
spoken to her mother on the phone more than once a week, we
assigned her a score of 5 on the combined item. Closeness was
measured by the following question: ``Taking all things
together, on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is really bad and
10 is absolutely perfect, how would you describe your
relationship with your mother?''
Independent Variables
Region was created by the NSFH using the state in which the
respondent resided. Following the lead of the preponderance of
research on region (Carter & Borch, 2005; Powers et al., 2003;
Twenge, 1997) we compared the South with all other regions
combined. States designated by the NSFH as Southern were
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and
Texas. It is important to note that prior to making a final
decision regarding our analytic approach, we conducted a set of
analyses in which we compared the South to each of the other
regions available in the NSFH (Northeast, Midwest, and West);
we found that the findings mirrored those comparing the South
to all other regions combined.
Traditionalism was assessed using two different constructs:
gender ideology and religious participation. Previous work
using the NSFH has included these constructs (Sarkisian,
Gerena, & Gerstel, 2006). The gender ideology scale consisted
of four items measuring the respondent's agreement (on a 5-
point Likert scale) with the following statements: (a) It is much
better for everyone if the man earns the main living and the
woman takes care of the home and family, (b) preschool
children are likely to suffer if their mother is employed, (c) it is
all right for mothers to work full time when their youngest child
is younger than 5 years, and (d) both the husband and the wife
should contribute to family income (a ¼ .69 in the subsample
used in this study).
Religious participation was measured by frequency of
attendance: 0 ¼ never, 1 ¼ less than once a month, 2 ¼ once
a month, 3 ¼ twice a month, 4 ¼ three times a month, 5 ¼ once
a week, 6 ¼ more than once a week.
Control Variables
We included six controls that have been found to affect
relations between parents and adult children--gender, race,
proximity, child's marital status, child's age, and child's
educational attainment. Respondent's gender was coded 0 ¼
male and 1 ¼ female. Respondent's race was measured by three
binary variables: Black, Hispanic, and White. White was the
comparison category throughout the analysis. Proximity was
measured in distance the child lived from the mother.
Categories were (a) less than 1 mile, (b) 1 to 14 miles, (c) 15

to 29 miles, (d) 30 to 59 miles, (e) 60 to 119 miles, (f) more
than 120 miles away. Marital status was assessed as 1¼married
or 0 ¼ not married. Child's age was measured in years.
Respondent's educational attainment was assessed as 1 ¼ less
than high school graduate, 2 ¼ high school graduate, 3 ¼ some
college, and 4 ¼ college graduate.
Statistical Analysis
We used ordinary least squares regression to assess the rela-
tionship between region and contact, and between region and
closeness, between respondents and their mothers. We created
interaction terms for region and gender as well as for region and
race in order to test for subgroup variations by child's gender
and race. We ran analyses using SPSS Version 14.
RESULTS
Region and Emotional Closeness
The first two data columns of Table 1 present the analysis of
factors associated with emotional closeness. These analyses
show that Southerners reported greater emotional closeness
with their mothers, both in the first model and when we con-
trolled for traditionalism.
Only one measure of traditionalism influenced emotional
closeness to mothers. Children reporting more frequent re-
ligious attendance were closer to mothers. However, as noted
previously, this factor did not reduce the regional differences
found in children's relationships with their mothers.
The control variables were related to closeness as expected
based on other studies of parent­child relations using the
NSFH. Adult children who were married, less educated, and
Black also reported greater closeness with mothers.
Region and Contact
The right-hand columns in Table 1 present the analysis of
factors associated with contact with mothers. The findings
indicate that Southerners had more contact with their mothers
than did adult children in other regions (Model 3). This
relationship remained even when we included measures of
traditionalism in the equation (Model 4).
Again, consistent with other analyses using NSFH data,
daughters, younger children, children with higher levels of
education, and children who lived closer to their mothers had
greater contact.
Because studies have shown intergenerational affect and
contact to differ by race and gender, we thought it was im-
portant to examine whether the patterns presented here were
affected by these factors. In separate analyses, we included
interaction terms for both race and child's gender. None of
these analyses revealed any differences in the effects of region
by race or gender.
DISCUSSION
In this study we examined whether there are regional
differences in relationships between adult children and their
mothers. The findings revealed consistent support for our
hypotheses that adult children in the South are closer to and
have greater contact with their mothers. Furthermore, these
patterns do not vary by child's gender or race.
Contrary to our expectations, the analysis did not indicate
that regional differences in contact and closeness could be
explained by traditionalism. Although the original associations
were reduced, the reductions were small and insignificant. This
pattern of findings provides strong support for several scholars'
assertion that Southern culture is a broader constellation of
social attitudes and behaviors than can be captured by specific
concepts such as gender-role attitudes or religiosity. Although
most research has emphasized these components of regional
differences, writers about the South have argued that Southern
culture goes beyond such specific issues to a broader con-
scientiousness held by Southerners regarding their distinctive
perspective (Hackney, 2005; Hurlbert, 1989; J. Reed, 2004;
J. S. Reed, 1972, 1993). Specifically, many authors have argued
that a distinctive Southern culture persists despite increases in
education and industrialization in the South (Hurlbert, 1989;
Hurlbert & Bankston, 1998; Kulinski, Cobb, & Gilens, 1997;
J. S. Reed, 1972, 1993). We believe that perhaps our findings
can be interpreted as suggesting that stronger intergenerational
relations are a component of Southern culture rather than
a separate phenomenon that can be explained by other dimen-
sions of this cultural phenomenon. In fact, greater emphasis

on parent­adult-child closeness and contact would be highly
consistent with the roles of both traditionalism and socia-
bility in Southern culture. Furthermore, if intergenerational
solidarity is a component of Southern culture, we would not
expect that including other dimensions of this culture would
substantially weaken the relationship between region and
family cohesion.
We recognize that the present study is limited both by the
range of dimensions of intergenerational relations and by the
particular measures available. We hope that future research
will shed additional light on the issue of regional differences
in intergenerational relations, including other dimensions of
solidarity such as support and attitude similarity. We also hope
that scholars will replicate the present study using other
measures of affect. We believe that the measures available in
the NSFH may account for the relatively low variance ex-
plained in our models. For example, the amount of variance
explained using more sensitive measures of closeness has been
found to be greater than that using the NSFH measure (Suitor &
Pillemer, 2006).
We hope that future studies will examine whether the pat-
terns of regional differences shown here are mirrored in adult
children's relationships with their fathers. We posit that the
patterns of greater closeness to mothers than fathers may differ
in the South, particularly for sons. Some of the components of
Southern culture, such as an increased emphasis on hunting and
contact sports (cf. J. S. Reed, 1972, 1993), are traditionally
male activities that might increase closeness and contact
between fathers and their adult sons (Nydegger & Mitteness,
1991), thus muting the pattern of closer mother­son than
father­son bonds generally shown in the literature (Kaufman &
Uhlenberg, 1998; Lawton et al., 1994).
In summary, this study contributes to a growing literature
indicating that there continues to be a distinct culture in the
South compared to other regions of the country (Hurlbert, 1989;
Hurlbert & Bankston, 1998; Kulinski et al., 1997; J. S. Reed,
1972, 1993; Suitor, Minyard, & Carter, 2001; Suitor & Reavis,
1995). Although traditionalism is a component of this cultural
difference (Powers et al., 2003; Suitor et al., 2001), the fact that
regional differences in adult children's relationships with their
mothers remain even after controlling on other dimensions of
traditionalism suggests that Southern culture extends beyond
merely more traditional attitudes regarding gender and religion.
In fact, we suggest that greater intergenerational cohesion may
be yet another component of this cultural phenomenon. Finally,
we believe that the findings we have presented make a case for
including region in studies of intergenerational relations
whenever this information is available.
