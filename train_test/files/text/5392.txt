Introduction
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the serious
microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM).
About 20­40% of diabetic patients suffer from DKD,
which is the leading cause of end stage renal disease
(ESRD).1
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in
most of the pathological processes that lead to DKD.
Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the major peptide of RAS, and is
formed under the action of the angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE). Ang II shows increased activity under
high glucose conditions. This causes hypertrophy of vari-
ous renal cells and has a pressor effect on arteriolar smooth
muscles, thereby resulting in increased vascular pressure.
It also induces inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth,
migration and differentiation.2
Not all patients with poor glycemic control eventually
develop DKD; on the contrary, some DM patients with
well-controlled blood glucose can still develop this dis-

Abstract
Introduction: To investigate the associations between the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms in the angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) gene and susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease (DKD); and the efficacy of valsartan in
reducing the urine protein in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
Materials and methods: We enrolled 128 T2DM patients in this study, including 54 cases with DKD (DKD+) and 74
controls (DKD­). The ACE polymorphism was assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the genotype distribution
and allele frequency were analyzed. The DKD+ group was subdivided into the DD, ID and II subgroups, based on their
genotypes. In addition, patients with DKD received valsartan treatment for 12 weeks. We determined changes in the
urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and serum creatinine (SCr).
Results: The frequencies of the genotypes DD and ID were higher in the DKD+ than in the DKD­ group. The
frequency of allele D was higher, and of allele I was lower, in the DKD+ than in DKD­ group (p < 0.05). Following
valsartan treatment, albuminuria was significantly decreased in subgroups DD and ID (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: In T2DM patients, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with onset of DKD. Furthermore, the ACE
I/D polymorphism influenced the renoprotective response to valsartan: Patients with the DD genotype benefitted the
most from this treatment.

ease. Studies show that there is a strong genetic predispo-
sition to the onset and progression of DKD.3,4
The ACE gene is composed of 26 exons and 25 introns,
with a length of 21 kb. There are > 160 ACE gene poly-
morphisms that are currently known; most of them are sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphisms. Rigat et al.5 first reported
that the ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism
is caused by the insertion or deletion of a 287 bpAlu repeat
sequence within intron 16, which results in three geno-
types. While the presence of the DD genotype was found
to be associated with the highest level of ACE, the enzyme
levels were reported to be the lowest in the II genotype.
Recently, many researchers have demonstrated that the
ACE I/D polymorphism is related to diabetic microangi-
opathy, and that the D allele might be a susceptibility fac-
tor for patients with DKD.6­8 The frequency of ACE alleles
varies within different ethnic groups, which might contrib-
ute to the conflicting views on the role of the ACE gene I/D
polymorphism in the development of DKD.9,10
With advancements in the field of pharmacogenom-
ics, the ACE I/D polymorphism was shown to contribute
to the therapeutic effect of the Ang II receptor antago-
nists (ARBs). Ruggenenti et al.11 report that the DD gen-
otype is associated with a better response to ARB therapy
in overt nephropathy of Type 2 diabetes, as compared to
the II genotype. A study by Felehgari et al.10 reveals that
the maximum impact of losartan therapy on ACE activ-
ity is observed in macroalbuminuric patients with the
DD genotype, rather than in normoalbuminuric patients.
Furthermore, Andersen et al.12 show that long-term treat-
ment with losartan has similar beneficial renoprotective
effects on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in
hypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients with the ACE II
and DD genotypes.
The present study aimed to investigate the associations
between the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms and the suscep-
tibility of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
to DKD; and to examine the correlation between this gene
polymorphism and the efficacy of valsartan in reducing
urine protein.
Subjects and methods
In the present study, we enrolled 128 patients diagnosed
with T2DM from 1 December 2013 to 31 October 2014 at
the Department of Endocrinology, People's Affiliated
Hospital of Jiangsu University, China. There were 54
patients, including 35 of male and 19 of female gender
(mean age: 62.43 ± 11.79 years) with DKD (DKD+); and
74 controls, including 54 of male and 20 of female gender
(mean age: 60.31 ± 11.28 years) without DKD (DKD­). A
detailed history was taken, and physical as well as labora-
tory examinations were performed on the subjects.
Informed written consent was obtained from each individ-
ual before participation. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of People's Hospital of Jiangsu
University. T2DM was diagnosed according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) criteria, while DKD was
defined as an albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30
mg/g.13,14 The 54 patients with DKD who were enrolled in
this study fulfilled the inclusion criteria of being > 18
years of age, and of not having undergone ARB nor ACE
inhibitor therapy within 4 weeks.
Patients were excluded if they had a history of malig-
nant hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal artery
stenosis, a creatinine clearance rate of < 30 mL/min, ear-
lier established persistent erythrocyturia and/or urinary
infection, or tumor; and if those of female gender were
pregnant or lactating.
The polymorphisms of the ACE gene were assayed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the genotype distri-
bution and allele frequency were analyzed. The patients
with DKD were further divided into three subgroups based
on their genotypes: DD, ID and II. According to conven-
tional diabetes therapy, they received valsartan (80 mg)
once a day for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment,
measurements of ACR, serum creatinine (SCr), systolic
blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
were repeated.
The data were presented as mean ± SD. One-way analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the between-
group and within-group differences. The paired Student's
t-test was employed to assess the differences between the
baseline values and the values after treatment with valsar-
tan. Count data were presented as medians (interquartile
range (IQR)) and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for
between-group comparisons. The genotypes and the ACE
allele frequencies in DKD+ patients were compared to the
controls using the chi-square test. Odds ratios (OR) were
calculated as estimates of relative risk for disease and the
95% CIs were obtained. Statistical significance was
assumed at p < 0.05. The statistical software package SPSS
version 17.0 was used for all the statistical analyses.
Results
As shown in Table 1, patients with DKD+ had significantly
higher ACR, SBP, DBP, and low-density lipoprotein C
(LDL-C) levels than did patients with DKD­ ; however,
their high-density lipoprotein C (HDL-C) levels were sig-
nificantly higher in DKD­ patients (p < 0.05).
Table 2 presents the ACE genotypes and the allele dis-
tribution in DKD+ and DKD­ patients. In DKD+ subjects,
the frequency of DD, ID and II genotypes were 37.1%,
48.1% and 14.8%, respectively. Among the DKD­ sub-
jects, 20.3% showed the DD genotype, the ID genotype
was present in 44.6% of the patients, while the II genotype
existed in 35.1% of the patients. The frequencies of allele
D and I were 61.1% and 38.9%, in the DKD+ patients; and
42.6% and 47.4% in the DKD­ subjects, respectively (p <
Wang et al. 3
0.05). Computation of the OR (95% CI) as an estimate of
relative risk for DKD indicated that the individuals with
allele D displayed a 2.12-fold increased risk, as compared
to allele I (95% CI: 1.279­3.516; p < 0.05).
There were no significant differences in the clinical
parameters before the treatment with valsartan, among
three genotype subgroups in DKD+ (p > 0.05; Table 3).
Six cases were eliminated as shedding cases. Following
12 weeks of treatment with valsartan, the mean value of
the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio was significantly
reduced in the DD genotype and the ID genotype, while
the changes in albuminuria in the II genotype remained
non-significant (Table 4). Albuminuria decreased from the
baseline by 18% (95% CI: 0.276­0.538; p < 0.05) in sub-
group DD, and by 8.5% (95% CI: 0.125­0.278; p < 0.05)
in the ID genotype. The valsartan treatment lowered albu-
minuria in the II subgroup by 0.7% (95% CI: ­0.05­0.38;
p > 0.05). There were significant differences in the reduc-
tion of albuminuria among the three different genotypes (p
< 0.05). The level of SCr remained unchanged in all the
examined subgroups (p > 0.05).
The mean value of SBP was significantly lowered in the
DD and ID genotypes, while the II genotype showed a
non-significant reduction. Similar results were obtained
for the DBP, which declined from 91.11 ± 9.95 mmHg at
baseline, to 78.21 ± 7.96 mmHg during the investigation
period in subgroup DD (p < 0.05); and from 91.77 ± 8.67
mmHg at baseline to 86.50 ± 9.87 mmHg during the test in
subgroup ID (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference
in the degree of decrease in urinary protein between the
two subgroups in the DKD+ group (p < 0.05); however,
there was no significant reduction in the SBP nor DBP in
subgroup II (p > 0.05; Table 4).
Discussion
DKD is a major microvascular complication of diabetes
and is commonly associated with ESRD. The RAS may be
activated early in the course of diabetes mellitus, and may
trigger changes in intraglomerular hemodynamics and
structural modifications in the diabetic kidney at both the
glomerular and tubulo-interstitial levels.2,15,16 In patients

with DKD, a positive association was reported between
the ACE D allele/homozygous DD genotype and ESRD.17
In a large meta-analysis, a 1.27-fold increased risk of DKD
was detected in the presence of the DD genotype versus
the II genotype; therefore, it was suggested that the ACE
I/D polymorphism contributes to the development of
DKD, especially among Asian T2DM patients.18
Studies related to the involvement of the ACE gene I/D
polymorphism in DKD have often presented contradictory
results. Kumar et al.19 report that there is no significant

association between the ACE I/D polymorphisms and
DKD in T2DM patients from Northern India. Conversely,
Al-Harbi et al.20 find that there is a strong association of
the ACE polymorphism with T2DM patients, although it
was not confirmed as a risk factor for the development of
DKD in the Bahraini population. In our study, the fre-
quency of the D allele in diabetic patients with DKD was
significantly higher (61.1%) than in the diabetic patients
without nephropathy (42.6%; p < 0.05). The presence of
the D allele was associated with a 2.12-fold increased risk
of DKD (p < 0.05). Our results were consistent with
the findings in the aforementioned Asian population.18
Therefore, our data indicated that the ACE gene I/D poly-
morphism might be associated with the development of
DKD, and the D allele is likely to be linked to susceptibil-
ity to DKD.
Ang II receptor blockers improve markers of kidney
disease, and slow the disease progression in diabetic, as
well as non-diabetic patients, by having blood pressure-
lowering effects and partially by their direct blockade of
Ang II.21
Losartan has been shown to have the most beneficial
effect on patients with the DD and ID genotypes.22 This
could be attributed to decreased plasma ACE activity and/
or decreased urinary albumin excretion in these patients.23
Similarly, the losartan therapy had greater influence on the
ACE activity in macroalbuminuric patients with the DD
genotype than in normo-albuminuric patients10; however,
no significant association was observed between the ACE
I/D polymorphism and the reduction of albuminuria in
losartan-treated hypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients.12
In our study, valsartan therapy significantly reduced
proteinuria in patients with the DD and ID genotypes;
however, the anti-proteinuric response in DD genotype
patients was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in sub-
jects with the ID genotype. This could again be related to
the increased activity of plasma ACE and/or increased
excretion of urinary albumin.
Ortlepp et al.24 have demonstrated that individuals
with the D allele in a homozygous condition experience
the most noticeable decrease in blood pressure, during
treatment with candesartan. Nevertheless, the association
of the ACE polymorphism with antihypertensive effect of
AT1R antagonists has not been clearly observed in many
studies. For instance, Nordestgaar et al.25 and Nakayama
et al.26 report that there is no correlation between the ACE
I/D polymorphism and an individual's response to losar-
tan therapy.
In the current study, the SBP and DBP reduced signifi-
cantly in the genotypes DD and ID (p < 0.05); conversely,
treatment with valsartan produced a decreased BP response
if the diabetic patients had the ACE I allele homozygous.
Although the reasons for these discrepancies are not well
understood, various factors (racial, environmental and
regional) may influence the final outcome of this study and
should be taken into consideration. Moreover, other con-
founding factors, such as changes in antihypertensive treat-
ment, blood pressure and glycemic control can contribute
to the progression of nephropathy. Interestingly, several
researchers10,12,19, 20, 22, 24­26 have examined the effects of
gene polymorphisms on a single drug; however, combined
medication is common in clinical practice. Therefore, the
relationship between gene polymorphism and drug interac-
tions needs to be elucidated. The pharmacogenomic strat-
egies pertaining to DKD are of great significance for
ascertaining the treatment options. The results of the pre-
sent study require further confirmation by including large
sample sizes and multicenter clinical trials.
Conclusions
In summary, the presence of the D allele significantly
increased the risk of DKD by 2.12-fold, and the ACE I/D
polymorphism was suggested to be strongly associated
with the development of DKD. In addition, our study
revealed that there was a better response to the treatment
with valsartan in DKD patients with the DD genotype.
This could further provide a basis for individualized ther-
apy for DKD.
