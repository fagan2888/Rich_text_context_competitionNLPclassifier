Objectives. This article compares patterns of association between cognitive functioning and a number of sociodemographic
and health correlates among older persons in Taiwan and the United States.
Methods. The study uses data from the 1993 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan and the 1993
Study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old in the United States. Separate multivariate regression models
are employed for each country to examine the effects of sociodemographic and health factors on cognitive functioning, and
to examine the marginal impact of cognitive functioning on activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL)
functioning.
Results. Results of the multivariate analyses show similar patterns of association across the two countries and replicate findings
from previous studies. Increasing age, female gender, lower education, depression, and selected health conditions are associated
with lower cognitive functioning. In addition, although a significant predictor of both ADL and IADL impairments, cognitive func-
tioning is more powerful with respect to explaining IADL impairments.
Discussion. Study findings suggest that the cognitive measures are capturing similar dimensions in Taiwan and the United
States, and that factors associated with cognitive functioning and its consequences with respect to physical functioning are simi-
lar in the two countries.
THOSE who have an interest in studying older adults have
long been aware of population aging, a term used to de-
scribe the growth in the number and proportion of older per-
sons that has been taking place in Western industrialized coun-
tries throughout much of the 20th century. Population aging
poses a number of challenges to society. For example, because
health tends to deteriorate with advancing age, older adults are
likely to utilize health services and rely on formal and informal
sources of support with greater frequency than younger per-
sons. As a result, older persons account for a disproportionate
share of direct and indirect health care costs. Absent of revolu-
tionary advances in medical technology that would alter the
aging process, population aging inevitably leads to heightened
demands for medical attention, increased caregiving burdens,
and subsequent rises in the proportion of national budgets de-
voted to medical care. Thus, age structure changes taking place
in the West have been accompanied by a growing concern
among policy makers with respect to the health status of older
adults.
Population aging is now occurring across a substantial part
of the non-Western world as well. Yet, despite these world-wide
aging trends, less attention has been devoted to older adults liv-
ing in non-Western societies. One of the reasons for this past
neglect has been the absence of adequate data. However, recent
data collection efforts are making possible comprehensive re-
search on health and aging issues across a variety of settings.
Comparative investigations that utilize these data are important
for assessing the generalizability of commonly held theories
and hypotheses across diverse cultural and geographic settings,
and the applicability of Western-developed policy in non-
Western settings. With this in mind, the aim of this research
was to compare the associations between measures of cognitive
functioning and a number of demographic and health-related
variables across samples of older adults living in the United
States and Taiwan.
Background
As part of the population aging process, improvements in
life expectancy have resulted in a larger number and proportion
of persons living to very old ages where the risk of dementia is
quite high (Christensen et al., 1994; Hertzog & Schaie, 1988;
Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, McDonald-Miszczak, & Dixon, 1992;
McDonald-Miszczak, Hubley, & Hultsch, 1996). Although
there is substantial variability in estimates depending on study
methodology, the prevalence of dementia has been estimated to
be as high as 45% among those 85 years of age and older
(Evans et al., 1990), making it one of the most prevalent chronic
conditions among older adults.
Cognitive impairment has tremendous consequences for the
ability of older persons to function independently in their
homes and communities. In the United States, persons with
cognitive disorders are much more likely than their cognitively
intact peers to enter nursing homes and be hospitalized, and
they stay in hospitals for long periods of time (Weiler, Lubben,
& Chi, 1991; Welsh, Walsh, & Larson, 1992). Although sever-
ity of impairment is also related to hospitalization and length of
stay, even the mildly impaired have high rates of utilization
(Binder & Robins, 1990). Indirect costs, which include care-
S291
S292 OFSTEDALETAL.
giving burden on families and the resultant loss in productivity,
are also consequential (Weiler, Chiriboga, & Black, 1994). In
addition, studies have documented a strong association between
cognitive impairment and rates of mortality (Kelman, Thomas,
Kennedy, & Cheng, 1994). Few assessments have brought to-
gether these various direct and indirect costs, but one such
study, conducted in 1985, estimated the total cost of senile de-
mentia in the United States to be about $88 billion in that year
(Huang, Cartwright, & Hu, 1988). Given the rapid rise in medi-
cal costs and the increase in the proportion of older adults, we
may assume that current costs would exceed this estimate by a
large margin.
In addition to the association with age, research has docu-
mented a strong relationship between cognition and education
(Frisoni, Rozzini, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi, 1993; Jorm et al.,
1997; Launer, Dinkgreve, Jonker, Hooijer, & Lindeboom, 1993;
Uhlmann & Larson, 1991). According to Mortimer and Graves
(1993), low levels of education may be the most significant risk
factor for cognitive impairment. Correlations between cognitive
status and a number of other health factors also have been es-
tablished. These include self-assessed health, health-related be-
haviors (Hultsch, Hammer, & Small, 1993), other psychiatric
disorders such as depression (Lichtenberg, Ross, Millis, &
Manning, 1995; Rummans, Smith, Lin, Waring, & Kokmen,
1997), history of stroke (Li et al., 1991), and other chronic ill-
nesses (Tranel, Benton, & Olson, 1997). Moreover, cognitive
functioning is required for a variety of daily living tasks, in-
cluding instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as
shopping, managing finances, and preparing meals, as well as
activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, and
eating. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that cog-
nitive status is highly predictive of IADLs (Fillenbaum,
Hughes, Heyman, George, & Blazer, 1988; Herzog & Wallace,
1997) and more moderately predictive of ADLs (Gill, Williams,
Richardson, Berkman, & Tinetti, 1997; Herzog & Wallace,
1997; Reed, Jagust, & Seab, 1989).
Until recently, sources of data on cognition were limited pri-
marily to clinically based studies conducted on convenience
samples. In recent years several population-based surveys have
incorporated items from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE;
Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). In addition, a modified
version of the MMSE, referred to as the Telephone Interview
for Cognitive Status (TICS; Brandt, Spencer, & Folstein, 1988),
has been developed for use in telephone surveys. The measures
included in the MMSE and TICS have been found to have high
internal and content validity in studies based in the United
States and other Western industrialized settings (Brandt et al.,
1988; Folstein et al., 1975; Herzog & Rodgers, 1999; Plassman,
Newman, Welsh, Helms, & Breitner, 1994), as well as several
studies that are based on Chinese populations (Chiu, Lee,
Chung, & Kwong, 1994; Guo, Lin, & Wong, 1988; Katzman et
al., 1988; Li et al., 1989). The measures have also been used in
numerous United States and European studies to examine cor-
relations between cognitive impairment, demographic charac-
teristics such as age and education (Hertzog & Schaie, 1988;
Launer et al., 1993), and measures of health and physical func-
tioning (Fillenbaum et al., 1988; Herzog & Wallace, 1997;
Hultsch et al., 1993).
Although several studies have attempted to ascertain the
prevalence or incidence of dementia in Asian settings (Li et al.,
1989, 1991; Liu et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1990), there has, up
to now, been very little research on factors associated with cog-
nition in Asian societies (notable exceptions include Liang,
Borawski-Clark, Liu, & Sugisawa [1996] and Yu et al. [1989]).
Yet, there is some urgency for such research in rapidly develop-
ing societies such as Taiwan and others in Eastern and South-
east Asia. These societies have recently experienced reductions
in fertility and mortality at unprecedented levels, the combina-
tion of which will lead to a dramatic increase in their older pop-
ulations. In fact, nowhere in the world is population aging oc-
curring as rapidly as in East and Southeast Asia (Hermalin,
1995; Martin, 1988). In the near future, these nations will have
the oldest age structures in the world (Rowland, 1994) and will
soon be faced with a multitude of health care challenges.
The current investigation, which is comparative in nature,
will focus on the key sociodemographic, functional, and health
correlates of cognitive functioning among older adults recently
surveyed in the United States and in Taiwan. A cross-country,
cross-cultural comparison of this sort is useful for assessing the
generalizability of findings from existing studies, most of which
have been based on Western populations. The similarity of the
design and content of the Taiwan and United States surveys
makes this comparison particularly powerful. Our general hy-
pothesis in this study was that the correlates would be similar
across the two countries, in a manner consistent with those
found in previous studies. More specifically, we expected in-
creased age, low socioeconomic status, poor physical and emo-
tional health, andriskyhealth-related behaviors to be associated
with lower levels of cognitive functioning in both Taiwan and
the United States.
Given the population aging that is occurring in Taiwan, we
expect the incidence and prevalence of cognitive disorder to
grow substantially in coming years. This suggests that, similar
to the United States, cognitive impairment will become an in-
creasingly important issue for diagnosis and treatment in
Taiwan. At the same time, there are distinct differences in fam-
ily organization and familial systems of support in Taiwan in
comparison to the United States. Family interactions in Taiwan
are more frequent and instrumental, and a high percentage of
older persons coreside with and/or are cared for by their chil-
dren (Hermalin, Ofstedal, & Chang, 1992). As such, the health
care of older adults is more likely to be viewed as a family-
related concern and, at least at the present time, placement in care
homes is extremely rare. This places additional strains on indirect
caregiving costs, such as productive time lost. While today's
Taiwanese households tend to be large in comparison to those in
the United States, current fertility rates translate into much
smaller families in the not-so-distant future, leaving fewer
household members available to care for the growing numbers
of cognitively impaired older adults. Evaluating the current and
future burden of cognitive impairment in Taiwan would seem
to be a critical part of any health policy agenda. By gaining a
better understanding of the factors that influence cognitive func-
tioning through the forthcoming comparative analyses, we hope
to come a step closer to this goal.
METHODS
This study draws on data from two different surveys of older
persons, bom of which were conducted in 1993, one in Taiwan
and the other in the United States. While the surveys differ to
COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN TAIWANAND THE U.S. S293
some extent in terms of their design and questionnaire content,
both are designed to be nationally representative of the older
population in their respective countries. In addition, each of the
surveys collects detailed information on health status, encom-
passing the domains of physical, mental, and cognitive health
and functioning.
The Taiwanese data come from the Survey of Health and
Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan, a nationally representa-
tive panel survey of 4,049 persons who were age 60 years and
older in 1989 (Hermalin, Liang, & Chang, 1989). To date, five
interviews have been conducted as part of this study: three ex-
tensive in-person interviews in 1989,1993, and 1996, and two
short telephone interviews in 1991 and 1995. A set of questions
to assess cognitive functioning was first introduced in the 1993
wave, and it is this wave of data that is used in this study. The
overall response rate for the 1993 survey wave was 84%.
The cognitive performance tests that were included in the
Taiwan survey were drawn primarily from the MMSE and ad-
ministered during the interview as part of the health status sec-
tion. Various versions of the MMSE have been utilized in com-
bination with other cognitive tests to determine the prevalence
of dementia in Chinese societies (Katzman et al., 1988; Salmon
et al., 1989; Zhang et al., 1990). These studies suggest that most
of the items in the MMSE are readily translatable into Chinese
without loss of meaning. The Taiwanese survey employed in
this analysis was administered by the Taiwan Provincial
Institute of Family Planning. Researchers at this organization
translated the items from the MMSE that were deemed most
appropriate for the Taiwanese context. The chosen tests re-
quested respondents to recall their address, the current date
(day, month, and year), day of the week, their mother's maiden
name, their current age and birth date, and the current and last
president of Taiwan. Each of these items was recorded by the
interviewer as having been reported correctly or incorrectly.
The first six of these items are measures of orientation and the
latter two are measures of knowledge. In addition, as a measure
of working memory, respondents were posed with a serial arith-
metic problem for which they were asked to subtract from 20
by 3 a total offivetimes. Those performing all five subtractions
correctly were recorded as having completed the task correctly.
Nonresponses on the individual cognitive items (i.e., don't
know, refusal, not ascertained) were recoded as incorrect re-
sponses for purposes of this analysis, as is often done in analy-
ses using the MMSE (Fillenbaum et al., 1988; Herzog &
Wallace, 1997),
Data for the United States come from the Study of Asset and
Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD; Soldo,
Hurd, Rodgers, & Wallace, 1997). AHEAD is a nationally rep-
resentative panel survey of persons age 70 years and over and
their spouses (of any age) in the United States. The baseline
sample comprised 8,222 persons (of whom 7,447 were age 70
and over), representing a response rate of 80%. Three waves of
data collection have been completed thus far, in 1993, 1995,
and 1998. Data from the baseline wave of AHEAD are used in
this analysis.
Although the cognition battery used in AHEAD was more
extensive overall, several items are similar to those asked in the
Taiwan survey. These include the date, day of week, and cur-
rent president of the United States. AHEAD also asked respon-
dents to name the current United States vice-president.
Although this question is not equivalent to the question on for-
mer president that was used in Taiwan, the two questions are
thought to tap a similar cognitive domain, that relating to
knowledge. Another test that is similar for the two surveys is
the serial subtraction exercise. In AHEAD respondents were
asked to subtract from 100 by 7 a total of five times. Although
we have no way of evaluating the relative difficulty of the two
tests directly we expect that, given the higher starting value
(100 versus 20) and the higher value of the number that respon-
dents are required to subtract by (7 versus 3), the AHEAD sub-
traction test was more difficult than the Taiwan subtraction test.
As will be shown later, the subtraction test was the only one for
which the American respondents performed more poorly (sub-
stantially so) than the Taiwanese respondents.
In addition to these comparable measures, AHEAD also in-
cluded a backwards count exercise (respondents were instructed
to count backwards from 20 as quickly as possible), two word
recognition questions (respondents were provided with descrip-
tions of two different objects and asked to identify them); and
both immediate and delayed word recall tests, for which re-
spondents were read a list of 10 words and were asked to repeat
as many as they could remember immediately after the words
were read and again at the end of the cognition section. For pur-
poses of this analysis, we utilize all of the AHEAD cognition
measures except the immediate and delayed recall tests. As with
the Taiwan cognition measures, the set of cognition tests that
we use from AHEAD measure dimensions of orientation,
knowledge, and working memory. The level of missing data
was again very low for the AHEAD cognition measures, and
missing values were imputed in the same way as for the Taiwan
survey.
Given that our focus in this study was on general patterns of
associations between sociodemographic and health factors on
the one hand, and cognitive functioning on the other, the lack of
precise equivalence of the cognitive measures across countries
is not a major concern. As long as the various sets of cognition
tests that are employed in each country provide some differenti-
ation within the samples with respect to the underlying concept
of interest (i.e., cognitive function), the actual tests need not be
identical for our purposes. In this regard, it is useful to note that
factor analyses performed on the two sets of cognition mea-
sures produced only a single factor for each country, and the re-
liability coefficient was similar for both (Cronbach's alpha =
.82 for Taiwan, .75 for AHEAD).
Because the cognition measures are performance based, they
were administered only to self-respondents in both the Taiwan
and United States surveys. Hence, our analysis necessarily ex-
cludes persons interviewed by a proxy respondent (9% in
Taiwan and 10% in the United States), who are likely to have
higher levels of cognitive impairment. Two other groups that
may be especially vulnerable to cognitive impairment and are
also excluded from this analysis are institutionalized persons
(who were out of scope for AHEAD and, for comparability pur-
poses, were excluded from the Taiwan analysis sample) and
survey nonrespondents. Although the rate of institutionalization
in each country is fairly low [less than 1% in Taiwan and 4% in
the United States for persons age 65 years and over (Strahan,
1997)], those who reside in institutions tend to have a much
higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (Welsh et al., 1992).
Likewise, poor health tends to be a common reason given for
S294 OFSTEDALETAL.
nonparticipation in surveys of older persons; hence, the nonre-
spondents for these surveys are likely to be frailer, both cogni-
tively and physically, than those who participated. As a result of
these exclusions, our results are likely to underestimate the level
of cognitive impairment in both of the populations under study.
However, our objective was not to assess absolute levels of cog-
nitive functioning, but rather to compare the correlates of cog-
nition across countries, and for this purpose the samples should
be satisfactory.
In thefirstpart of our analysis we examine and compare lev-
els and distributions for individual tests and summary scores
across the surveys, and examine the age patterns for each of the
cognitive measures. In the second stage, we employ multivari-
ate regression analysis and compare the associations of sociode-
mographic, health, and health behavior characteristics with cog-
nitive functioning across the two countries. Throughout our
analyses we run separate tabulations and regressions for each
country. Both the Taiwan and AHEAD samples are restricted to
self-respondents who were age 70 years and over and living in
the community at the time of the 1993 survey, yielding eligible
sample sizes of 1,533 for Taiwan and 6,651 for AHEAD.
Table 1 shows the sample distributions and means for the co-
variate and outcome variables that are included in the multivari-
ate analyses. The questions relating to each of the covariates
were very similar in the Taiwan and AHEAD surveys. Here we
provide a brief description of the variables before proceeding to
the multivariate results.
The variable for age measures the respondent's age at the
time of the interview and is represented as a categorical vari-
able in the analyses (5-year age groups, with the 85+ group
serving as the omitted group in the regression models). Gender
is also represented as a dummy variable in the regression mod-
els, with females serving as the omitted group. Because the
sample distributions for number of years of completed educa-
tion are quite different for Taiwan and the United States, and
because a year of education may differ in terms of its impact on
cognitive functioning in the two settings, we opted to use differ-
ent cutpoints for education in order to make the sample distri-
butions somewhat similar on the categorical variable.
Ethnicity was categorized into four groups in Taiwan
(Mainlanders vs Fukienese, Hakka, and other) and three groups
in the United States (non-Hispanic Whites vs non-Hispanic
Blacks and Hispanics). In both Taiwan and the United States,
ethnicity can be used to control for unmeasured differentials
with respect to access to health care, quality of education, and
other socioeconomic factors that might influence cognition.
Although the ethnic distinctions in Taiwan are not as pro-
nounced as in the United States, there are some socioeconomic
differences across the ethnic groups represented here.
Mainlanders tend to be more advantaged than the other groups
in terms of education and occupations that provide access to
health care. Nonetheless, the fact that the ethnic differences in
socioeconomic status are less pronounced in Taiwan leads us to
expect smaller differentials in cognition across ethnic groups in
Taiwan than in the United States.
Self-rated health is treated as a categorical variable ranging
from 1 = excellent to 5 = poor; the omitted group in the regres-
sion models comprises respondents who reported excellent
health, and four dummy variables were included to represent
each of the other categories. The questions on self-rated health

that were used in the two surveys were quite comparable, al-
though there was a slight difference in the middle three re-
sponse categories, as is reflected in the table. The indicator for
stroke comes from a set of questions on chronic conditions in
each survey; in Taiwan, the question asked whether the respon-
dent had ever had a stroke, and in the United States, whether
the respondent had ever been told by a doctor that he/she had a
stroke. The questions on vision and hearing ask respondents in
both countries to rate their eyesight and hearing (in the pres-
ence of eyeglasses and/or hearing aids, if normally worn) on a
scale of 1 = excellent to 5 = poor. These indicators were re-
coded as dichotomous variables for the analysis, with 1 indicat-
ing a fair or poor rating of eyesight/hearing and 0 indicating a
rating of good to excellent. Current status was ascertained for
smoking and drinking in both surveys (in addition to chewing
COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN TAIWANAND THE U.S. S295
betel for Taiwan). The variables used in our analyses simply in-
dicate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker
and current drinker (both coded 1 if yes, 0 otherwise) without
regard to frequency or quantity of consumption.
Both the Taiwan and AHEAD surveys incorporated a subset
of items from the Centers for Epidemiological Studies-
Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), although the ques-
tion wording, response categories, and number of items dif-
fered slightly. The variables used in the analysis are simple
counts of the number of depressive symptoms reported on these
items, ranging from 0 to 5 for Taiwan and from 0 to 8 for
AHEAD. Respondents with missing values on any individual
item were assigned a missing value on the count variable and
excluded from the analyses.
The measures of ADL and IADL functioning represent the
number of impairments of each type that were reported by re-
spondents. As with the CES-D, the question wording and items
differed slightly across countries. Hence, in the AHEAD mod-
els, impairment implies that the respondent either receives help,
uses assistive devices, or has difficulty performing the activity,
whereas for the Taiwan models, respondents who reported hav-
ing any difficulty performing an activity are classified as im-
paired on that particular item. For the ADLs, the same set of ac-
tivities was included in both surveys; these included bathing,
dressing, eating, walking, getting in and out of bed or chairs,
and using a toilet (range 0-6). The IADL activities were slightly
different in the two surveys. In the Taiwan survey, the IADLs
that were measured include preparing meals, shopping, manag-
ing money, using a telephone, doing heavy housework, and
doing light housework (range 0-6); in the AHEAD survey, the
IADLs include preparing meals, shopping, managing money,
using a telephone, and taking medication (range 0-5).
Lastly, with respect to cognition, in the multivariate analyses
we focus on a composite measure that incorporates the full
range of cognitive tests from the 1993 Taiwan survey (total of 9
items), and all except for the word recall tests from the AHEAD
survey (8 items yielding a total possible score of 15). The mean
values for the number of correct responses were 7.2 for the
Taiwan sample and 12.0 for the United States sample, as shown
in Table 1.
Respondents who had missing values on any of the covari-
ates are excluded from all analyses presented in this article.
This includes 70 out of 1,533 Taiwanese respondents (4.6%)
and 195 of the 6,651 AHEAD respondents (2.9%).
RESULTS
General Levels and Distributions of the Cognitive Measures
Table 2 presents the percentage of respondents who gave
correct answers on individual cognitive performance tests, as
well as the mean number of correct responses on all tests com-
bined. In general, the percentage reporting correct answers is
quite high in both Taiwan and the United States, but is some-
what higher in the United States on similar items. For example,
76% of persons age 70+ in the United States were able to accu-
rately report the date compared to 72% in Taiwan. Likewise,
96% of elderly persons in the United States were able to name
the day of the week, compared to 89% of the Taiwanese. One
exception to this pattern is the serial subtraction test, for which
the AHEAD percentage is about half that of Taiwan. As noted

earlier, this difference may be due, at least in part, to greater
difficulty of the subtraction test in the AHEAD study.
Previous research has established that cognition declines with
age and that this decline accelerates after age 70 (Christensen
et al., 1994; Hertzog & Schaie, 1988; Hultsch et al., 1992;
MacDonald-Miszczak et al., 1996). The patterns of cognitive
performance by age, also shown in Table 2, are in keeping with
the literature and consistent across items and countries. For
every item in both countries, the percentage of respondents who
gave a correct response declines with increasing age. In Taiwan,
the largest decline appears to occur between the two youngest
age groups, with the decline leveling off slightly after ages
75-79. For the United States, in contrast, the decline is gener-
ally sharper between the middle and oldest age group than be-
tween the youngest and middle age group.
Correlates of Cognitive Functioning
In addition to age, previous research has identified a number
of key sociodemographic and health factors that are associated
with cognitive status. Some of these factors include education,
self-assessed health, depression, chronic conditions (most no-
tably stroke), functional impairments (hearing, vision, and
physical functioning), and health behaviors such as drinking
and smoking. We turn now to multivariate analyses of these
correlates of cognitive functioning for Taiwan and the United
States.

higher among females than males, and decreases with educa-
tion. All of these findings are consistent with the literature, as
reviewed in the introduction.
With respect to education, in both Taiwan and the United
States the groups with lowest relative levels of education had
significantly higher numbers of errors than those with moderate
or high levels of education. Hence, despite the fact that elderly
Taiwanese had substantially lower education overall than the
United States elderly subjects, the association between educa-
tion and cognition was notably consistent. As education has
been shown to be an important factor in maintaining cognitive
health, the lower levels of education in Taiwan may imply that
this cohort of Taiwanese elders is at greater risk of cognitive
impairment than elderly people in the United States. Although a
comparison of levels of cognitive function is not the main focus
of this study, this would be consistent with our descriptive re-
sults that showed overall lower percentages of correct responses
on similar items for the Taiwan sample.
In addition, the health factors show similar patterns of asso-
ciation, and patterns that are also consistent with previous re-
search. Compared to persons who rated their health as excel-
lent, those who reported poor health had significantly higher
numbers of errors. Similarly, stroke, depressive symptoms, and
vision problems were associated with poorer cognitive func-
tioning in both Taiwan and the United States. Taiwan also
shows a significant association between hearing problems and
cognition. Although the coefficient for the United States is in
the same direction, it is not statistically significant. On the other
hand, smoking and drinking are associated with cognitive func-
tioning in the United States, but these associations are not sig-
nificant in Taiwan. Interestingly, whereas being a current
smoker is associated with a higher number of cognitive errors,
alcohol consumption appears to have a protective effect in the
United States. More in-depth analysis from the AHEAD study
suggests a U-shaped association between drinking and cogni-
tion, whereby total abstinence is associated with lower cogni-
tion, low and moderate levels of drinking with higher cognition,
and high levels of drinking with lower cognition (Ofstedal &
Herzog, 1998).
For both countries, ethnicity showed a significant association
with cognition, with the most advantaged groups in terms of
socioeconomic status (Mainlanders in Taiwan and Whites in
the United States) having higher cognition scores (i.e., fewer er-
rors) than other groups. However, the effect of ethnicity was
much stronger in the United States, a finding that is consistent
with our expectation given the less pronounced socioeconomic
differentials across ethnic groups in Taiwan.
As afinalpoint of comparison, we examined the association
between cognition and physical functioning in the two coun-
tries. We focused on two different measures of physical func-
tioning--number of ADL and IADL impairments. OLS regres-
sion was used to estimate the marginal effect of cognition on
the number of ADL and IADL impairments, controlling for key
sociodemographic and health correlates of physical function-
ing. More specifically, we estimated one model that contains
only the control variables as predictors (i.e., the base model),
and a second model in which we added the cognition score as a
predictor (i.e., the cognitive model). As control variables, we
used the same measures of age, gender, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, vision, hearing, depression, smoking, and drinking as in
the previous model, in addition to the number of chronic dis-
eases reported by the respondent. Because the dependent vari-
ables used in the OLS models are again quite skewed, we per-
formed logistic regression analyses to predict any ADL and
IADL impairment (as in Herzog & Wallace, 1997). The results
of the logistic analyses were similar to the OLS results; again,
for ease of interpretation, we present the OLS results here.
Table 4 shows the results of the pair of regression models for
both countries and summarizes the marginal contribution of
cognition toward explaining the variance in ADL impairments.
The second to last row of the table presents the R2 values for the
base model and the cognitive model for both countries. The
bottom row of the table shows the change in R2 produced by the
addition of the cognition score in the model.
Our primary interest in this set of analyses is on the effect of
cognitive functioning on number of ADL impairments and the
amount of additional variance that is explained by the inclusion
of the cognition score in the models. On these points, the re-
sults presented in Table 4 suggest two keyfindings.First, as ev-
idenced by the coefficients and standard errors for the cognitive
score variables, cognition is an important predictor of the num-
ber of ADL impairments. For both Taiwan and the United
States, an increase in cognitive functioning is associated with a
decline in the number of ADL impairments (t = -5.5, df - 1,
p < .001 for Taiwan; t = -9.4, df= \,p < .001 for the United
States). Despite the significance of the effect for the cognitive
score, adding cognition to the model does not increase the over-
all explained variance in the number of ADL impairments by a
substantial amount (from .14 to .16 in Taiwan, and .21 to .22 in
the United States as shown in Table 4).
With respect to the other predictors in the model, we observe
strong and expected effects of age, chronic conditions, vision
impairment, and depressive symptoms on the number of ADL
impairments. Gender shows an opposite effect in the two coun-
tries, with males having higher numbers of ADL impairments
than females in Taiwan, and males having fewer impairments
in the United States. Drinking alcoholic beverages is associated
with fewer ADL impairments in the United States, but not in
Taiwan. The addition of cognition to the model had little im-
pact on the effects of these other factors.
Comparable models predicting IADL impairments are pre-
sented in Table 5. These results show that the net effect of cog-
nition is again highly significant in both countries (t = -14.7, df
= l,p< .001 for Taiwan; t = -18.3, df= l,p< .001). In contrast
to the models predicting ADL impairment, however, the
amount of variance explained by the model is substantially in-
creased with the addition of the cognition variable (from .33 to
.42 in Taiwan, and .19 to .23 in the United States). This sug-
gests that cognition is more closely linked to IADL than to
ADL functioning among older persons in both of these settings.
The effects of sociodemographic and health factors are simi-
lar to those observed for ADL impairment, with strong positive
effects of age, multiple chronic conditions, vision and hearing
impairment, and depressive symptoms on the number of IADL
impairments. As suggested by the base model results, males
have fewer IADL impairments than females in Taiwan; how-
ever, this effect disappears once cognition is taken into account.
More generally, the addition of cognition to the model tended
to reduce the effects of the sociodemographic and health vari-
ables, but most remained statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
As the number and proportion of persons living into their
80s and beyond continues to increase around the world, cogni-
tive impairment and dementia, particularly, will emerge as a
significant component of the global burden of disease for el-
derly people. Hence, it will be important to gain a better under-
standing of the prevalence of cognitive impairment, the factors
that precipitate it, and its consequences with respect to the need
for informal and formal care across many societies and cul-
tures. In this study, we focused on comparing associations be-
tween cognition and a number of factors rather than on com-
paring levels of cognitive functioning, but we suggest the need
for further verification of cognitive tests across countries so that
more detailed comparative research can take place.
Our objective was to compare associations between cogni-
tive functioning and a number of covariates in samples of older
persons in Taiwan and the United States and, in doing so, make
use of a relatively new and little studied set of data on cognition
from a survey in Taiwan. The cognition measures that were in-
cluded in the Taiwan and United States surveys, though not
identical, are derived primarily from the same source, the
MMSE. The Taiwan survey utilized those tests from the MMSE
that were deemed to be most easily translatable into Chinese
language and culture. Several of these items (identification of
current day, month, year, day of week, president, and a subtrac-
tion test) were also included in the AHEAD survey in the
United States.
The analyses focus on an examination of the distribution of
responses for specific cognitive measures, overall and by age,
and a comparison of associations between cognition and other
factors known to correlate with cognitive functioning, such as
education and ADL and IADL impairment. Although the ques-
tions that are used to measure the covariates are similar across
the two surveys, there are some differences in distributions and

classifications on these variables across the two countries. For
instance, the distributions and/or distinctions for some demo-
graphic variables such as gender, education, and ethnic distribu-
tion vary. We attempt to make these items as comparable as
possible, for example, by dividing education into three cate-
gories that more or less represent proportionate divisions of the
sample, and by classifying race and ethnicity into the predomi-
nant groups in the two societies. There are also differences in
health behaviors such as smoking frequency, and there may be
differences in the tendency to report chronic ailments or func-
tional impairments.
Such variations by country could provide ready explanations
for any differences observed in the association between cogni-
tion and these covariates. The differences in the educational at-
tainment of Taiwanese and American elders, for example, might
lead one to expect that the association between education and
cognition would differ, perhaps showing a stronger association
in Taiwan, where there is more variation in the type of educa-
tion that older persons would have been exposed to during their
youth; in Taiwan, a much larger proportion of the older popula-
tion did not receive any formal education at all. In the face of
these differences, then, the similarity that we observed in pat-
terns of association between Taiwan and the United States seem
to provide strong evidence of congruence in the determinants of
cognitive impairment across the two societies. For instance, in
both Taiwan and the United States, performance on the cogni-
tive tests declined with age and increased with education, pat-
terns that have been well-established in numerous other studies.
Examination of other factors that are associated with cognition
as an outcome, and observed associations between cognition
and ADL and IADL functioning also revealed findings that
were largely consistent across these two samples, as well as
with other studies in the United States and Western Europe.
Both the descriptive and multivariate analyses revealed age
S300 OFSTEDALETAL.
pattern differences that warrant further investigation. In particu-
lar, the steepest declines in cognition with age appear to take
place in the eighth decade of life in Taiwan (with regression co-
efficients in Table 3 increasing from -.41 for the 70-74 age
group to -.23 for those age 75-79) and taper off thereafter.
Indeed, the difference between 80-84-year-olds and 85+ year-
olds is nonsignificant in Taiwan. In the United States, however,
there is relatively little difference in effects for 70-74-year-olds
and 75-79-year-olds in comparison with the oldest age group,
but cognition appears to decline fairly sharply thereafter
through the 80s and perhaps beyond. These differences may be
attributable to instability in the Taiwan results given the rela-
tively small number of persons age 80+ and especially 85+, to
differences in the sets of cognition tests that were administered
in the two countries, or they may reveal more fundamental dif-
ferences in the age patterns of cognitive decline in the two
countries. Given that there are sharp age differentials in educa-
tional level among these elderly cohorts, it is also possible that
our measures of education are not adequate to capture the full
gradation of the education effect or that there are interaction ef-
fects that account for the different age patterns across countries.
As a preliminary examination, we used a number of different
classifications of education and tested for interaction effects be-
tween education and age in both countries. Regardless of how
education was classified in the models, the age patterns re-
mained essentially unchanged, and none of the Education by
Age interaction effects were significant. This topic is beyond
the scope of the current study, but is one that deserves more de-
tailed focus in subsequent analyses.
It is also interesting to note that cognition appears to play a
much larger role in IADL than in ADL functioning, as evi-
denced by the larger changes in R2 values in the IADL models.
This finding seems reasonable because the IADLs are thought
to have a larger mental or cognitive component than the ADLs
(Herzog & Wallace, 1997). Nevertheless, we must be careful
when interpreting this difference. As mentioned previously, in-
stitutionalized persons and those who were too frail to partici-
pate in the study were excluded from the samples, and these
groups tend to have high levels of ADL impairment. Had they
been included in the studies, we may have seen a stronger asso-
ciation between cognition and ADL functioning than we ob-
serve in these samples. Future research that incorporates the in-
stitutionalized population will help shed some light on this set
of associations.
Finally, the results relating to ADL and IADL functioning
point out an unexpected contrast across countries. Tables 4 and
5 showed that the total variance explained by the cognitive
models was similar in the United States for the ADL and IADL
model (.22 for ADL vs .23 for IADL), but differed greatly in
Taiwan, where the explained variance was nearly three times
higher in the IADL compared with the ADL model (.16 for
ADL vs .42 for IADL). This suggests that there may be differ-
ences in the nature of these tasks and/or in the way in which
cognitive impairment (as well as other covariates) impacts on
the various functioning tasks across cultures.
Despite these interesting differences, the general patterns of
association between cognitive functioning and the covariates
examined in this study are very similar for Taiwan and the
United States. Thesefindingssuggest that the MMSE taps simi-
lar dimensions of cognitive functioning in the two cultures, and
that it may serve as a useful model for assessing cognitive im-
pairment in other settings as well.
