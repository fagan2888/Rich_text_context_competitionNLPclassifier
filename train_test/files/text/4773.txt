Revisiting the Red Effect on Attractiveness
and Sexual Receptivity: No Effect of the
Color Red on Human Mate Preferences
Leonard S. Peperkoorn1, S. Craig Roberts2, and Thomas V. Pollet1
Abstract
Color-in-context theory is the first theoretical framework for understanding color effects in human mate preferences, arguing
that red clothing enhances attractiveness ratings. Here we present three empirical studies failing to support this prediction.
We aimed to extend the current literature by differentiating color effects by temporal context (short-term vs. long-term
mating). Experiment 1 involved Dutch participants rating a woman in red, white, and black on (sexual) attractiveness.
Experiment 2 replicated the first experiment with an American sample. In the final experiment, we aimed to replicate a study
that did find evidence of a red effect, using a substantially larger sample size. The results from each of the three studies
(totaling N ¼ 830 men) fail to support the red effect. We discuss the implications of our results and avenues for future
research on red effects and attractiveness.

In recent years, several researchers have argued that humans
might be affected by the presence of color cues in opposite-sex
conspecifics (e.g., Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Pazda, Elliot, &
Greitemeyer, 2014; Roberts, Owen, & Havlicek, 2010).
Color-in-context theory (Elliot & Maier, 2012) is the first the-
oretical framework formulated by social psychologists aimed
at understanding the effects of color in mate choice. Color-in-
context theory has six core premises. First, color is argued to be
not merely of aesthetic value but rather carries symbolic mean-
ing and may have a utility function as well. Second, the percep-
tion of a color affects psychological functioning in line with the
meaning of that color. For instance, if a certain color carries
positive connotations, then it will evoke approach-related psy-
chological processes. Third, color effects take place largely
outside of conscious awareness (i.e., they are automatic).
Fourth, color meanings are derived from both innate prefer-
ences and learning (culture). These are not seen as mutually
exclusive processes: instead, the latter builds upon the former
and may even extend the association between color and mean-
ing beyond biological signals to artificial displays and orna-
mentation, as in clothing and cosmetics. An example of the
former would be reddening of the skin that can potentially cue
sexual receptivity in females (Elliot & Maier, 2012), whereas
the latter can be exemplified by women wearing a red dress to
signal interest in casual sex (Elliot & Pazda, 2012; also see
Beall & Tracy, 2013). Fifth, it is postulated that color influ-
ences not only affect (e.g., excitement and attraction; anxiety
and fear), cognition (e.g., flexible global processing; narrow
rigid processing) and behavior (e.g., approach behavior; avoid-
ance behavior), but that a reverse effect also exists: affective,
cognitive, and behavioral processes impact on color perception
(e.g., Bubl, Kern, Ebert, Bach, & van Elst, 2010). Finally, color
can encompass diverse meanings in different contexts and

therefore elicit different behavioral responses. The ruby red
surroundings of the Red Light District invite the perceiver to
approach, whereas the flashing red lights of the fire brigade
warn perceivers to keep their distance. Elliot and Maier (2012)
argue that, in a similar way, red can undermine intellectual
performance in the achievement domain (Elliot, Maier, Moller,
Friedman, & Meinhardt, 2007; Maier, Elliot, & Lichtenfeld,
2008) but can enhance attractiveness in the affiliation domain
(e.g., Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Niesta Kayser, Elliot, & Feltman,
2010). It is this affiliation context, more specifically the mating
context in which men evaluate women's attractiveness, which
forms the focus of this paper.
Empirical Evidence for the Red Effect in Human Mate
Preferences
Background color. In their seminal work, Elliot and Niesta
(2008) demonstrated that the color red has a significant impact
on opposite-sex ratings of attractiveness. Across four experi-
ments they found that a black-and-white photo of a woman in
front of a red background was deemed more attractive and
sexually desirable by men, and participants wanted to engage
in more sexual behavior with the woman, than the same woman
in front of a white, gray, or green background. Schwarz and
Singer (2013) extended research on the red effect by distin-
guishing women of reproductive age from menopausal women
by showing men a photograph of a young woman versus an
older woman in front of a red or white background. No support
for the red effect was found for physical attractiveness ratings
for either the old or young woman. However, the young woman
in the red condition received higher sexual attractiveness rat-
ings compared to the same woman in the white condition.
Moreover, Elliot, Tracy, Pazda, and Beall (2013) presented
preliminary evidence for the potential universality of the red
effect in human mate preferences in a relatively isolated com-
munity in Burkina Faso. In this study, the stimulus woman in
the red condition was deemed more attractive and increased
men's willingness to meet and court her. However, there was
no significant difference in the willingness to have sexual inter-
course with the woman, or in the perceived sexual interest of
the woman. Lastly, Young (2015) presented participants with
40 images to investigate the influence of baseline attractiveness
on the red effect. The red effect emerged for female faces
prerated as attractive but not for unattractive female faces using
gray and blue as contrast colors.
Clothing color. Most studies investigating color effects on attrac-
tiveness ratings have manipulated the clothing color of the
target. Across studies, mixed results have been obtained. Elliot
and Niesta (2008: Study 5) found that a stimulus woman
dressed in a red shirt received higher ratings on perceived
attractiveness, sexual desire, desired sexual behavior, and will-
ingness to date and spend money on the woman compared to
the same woman dressed in a blue shirt. Providing additional
insight into color effects, Roberts, Owen, and Havlicek (2010)
compared red clothing with five contrast colors: black, white,
yellow, blue, and green employing a within-participant design.
In Study 1, stimulus women in red clothing were not signifi-
cantly different from black or blue clothing in terms of the
attractiveness ratings received by men. However, women
dressed in red apparel received higher attractiveness evalua-
tions by men rating photographs than women in green, yellow,
and white colors. Similarly, in Study 2, women wearing red
shirts did not receive higher attractiveness ratings compared to
black, blue, and green contrast colors but were significantly
different from yellow and white shirts. Importantly, in Study
3, it was demonstrated that clothing color has psychological
effects not only on perceivers but also on wearers. Women in
red clothes may feel more desirable and consequently behave
differently than women wearing other colors, underlining the
importance of distinguishing perceiver from wearer effects
when investigating the red effect. Gu´
eguen (2012b), presented
a photograph of a young woman in a red, white, blue, or green
shirt. Higher attractiveness scores were obtained for the woman
in a red shirt compared to the same woman in green or blue
shirts. However, there was no significant difference between
the red and the white condition. Similarly, Pazda, Elliot, and
Greitemeyer (2012) demonstrated higher attractiveness evalua-
tions and heightened sexual desire by men for a woman in a red
shirt compared to the same woman in a green shirt. The authors
reported in a later study (Pazda et al., 2014) that the woman in a
red knee-length dress received significantly higher attractive-
ness ratings compared to the white knee-length dress. Yet, no
significant difference on the attractiveness measure was found
between the red and the black dress. Wen, Zuo, Wu, Sun, and
Liu (2014) investigated sexual dimorphism as a potential mod-
erator of the red effect. In their study, feminine women dressed
in red did receive significantly higher ratings on sexual attrac-
tiveness compared to the same women dressed in white or blue
apparel. Masculine women did not differ over color conditions.
Overall, there were no significant differences in general attrac-
tiveness when presenting men with pictures of women in red,
white, or blue clothing. In an experiment by Lynn, Giebelhausen,
Garcia, and Patumanon (2016), no red effect was found in a
large (N ¼ 1,075) online experiment using a hypothetical tip-
ping scenario. In fact, men tipped the waitress in red clothing
significantly less than the waitress in black, whereas no signif-
icant difference was found between red and white shirts. Also,
there were no significant differences in attractiveness ratings
for the waitress in red, white, or black apparel.
Moving beyond attractiveness ratings, Niesta Kayser et al.
(2010) showed in a laboratory study that men asked women
wearing a red shirt more intimate questions and sat closer to
where a woman in red was expected to sit, compared with
women wearing green or blue shirts.
Gu´
eguen (2012a) extended these laboratory-based findings
to the field: hitchhiking women in red clothing were offered
more rides than women dressed in other colors. Gu´
eguen and
Jacob (2013) performed another field study to find out if
women would receive more responses to their online personal
profile if they wore red compared to five other colors, which
was indeed the case. In another field study, men were found to
2 Evolutionary Psychology
give waitresses higher tips when they were dressed in red com-
pared to other colors (Gu´
eguen & Jacob, 2014). Relating to the
signaling function of red, it appears the red-attraction link is
mediated by sexual receptivity, where women choosing to pres-
ent themselves in red clothing are regarded to be sexually
receptive and have more sexual intent than women in white,
green, or blue clothing (Gu´
eguen, 2012b; Pazda, Elliot, &
Greitemeyer, 2012). However, whereas Pazda, Elliot, and Grei-
temeyer (2014) found higher sexual receptivity ratings for a
woman in red versus the same woman in white, ratings for red,
and black did not differ significantly.
Face and body coloration. Research investigating the red effect on
attractiveness has also considered facial coloration. Redness in
women's faces is preferred by men as these are rated to be
healthier (Re, Whitehead, Xiao, & Perrett, 2011; Stephen,
Coetzee, Law Smith, & Perrett, 2009) and more attractive
(Re et al., 2011) than unrubified female faces. Similarly, red-
ness in women's facial lips enhanced the apparent femininity
and attractiveness of female faces to male participants (Stephen
& McKeegan, 2010). In a more applied setting, Gu´
eguen
(2012c) examined the effect of lipstick in two field studies.
Women who wore red lipstick were approached by more men
in a bar compared to the brown lipstick or no lipstick condition,
whereas red and pink lipstick were not significantly different.
Similarly, women with red lipstick were approached by men
sooner than women in the no lipstick condition. Gu´
eguen and
Jacob (2012) also found that women with red lipstick received
tips more frequently than women with brown lipstick or no
lipstick, with no significant difference between red and pink
lipstick. The amount of tips women received were higher for
women in the red lipstick condition compared to the no lipstick
condition. Furthermore, women with a red hair color (Gu´
eguen,
2012d) did not receive more tips than women with either blond,
brown, or black hair color. Finally, contrary to the suggestion
by Morris (1967), research found that red vulval skin color did
not increase men's sexual attraction compared to pale pink,
light pink, or dark pink contrast colors (Johns, Hargrave, &
Newton-Fisher, 2012).
Object color. To our knowledge only one study has investigated
the effect of nearby red objects to women's attractiveness. Lin
(2014) found that women with red laptops were significantly
more attractive and had more sex appeal than women with
black, silver, or blue laptops. Furthermore, women with red
laptops enhanced men's desired sexual activity with the woman
compared to women with silver laptops. No significant differ-
ences were found on the desired sexual activity measure
between red, black, and blue laptops.
Strategic Clothing Color Preference
Elliot and Pazda (2012) demonstrated that women are more
likely to choose to wear red when imagining being interested
in casual sex, and more likely to advertise themselves in red
clothing on their web profile when indicating desire for casual
sexual relations compared to women who do not express such
desires. Incidentally, in this study black is by far the most
preferred clothing color in both the casual sex web profiles and
the nonsexual profiles. However, the preference for black
clothing does not shift contingent on women's desires. Simi-
larly, women expecting to converse with an attractive versus a
nonattractive man were more likely to choose to wear red
clothing rather than green clothing and more likely to wear red
clothing over blue clothing when expecting to converse with an
attractive man versus an attractive woman (Elliot, Greitemeyer,
& Pazda, 2013). These findings are corroborated by a study by
Niesta Kayser, Agthe, and Maner (2016) where significantly
more red was displayed by women expecting to meet an attrac-
tive versus an unattractive man. The women also displayed a
larger quantity of red and more conspicuous red in the former
condition. In line with these studies, Prokop and Hromada
(2013) report that women indicated a preference for red cloth-
ing in situations where the probability of meeting a potential
mate was high (e.g., going to a party or on a date) compared to
situations where the chance of meeting a potential mate is low
(e.g., working in the garden or visiting grandparents). Recently,
some research has also investigated the effect of fertility status
on clothing color preferences. Beall and Tracy (2013) found
that women wearing red or pink were substantially more likely
to be at the high conception risk phase of the menstrual cycle as
compared to women not wearing these colors (for a critical
discussion, see Gelman, 2013). According to Tracy and Beall
(2014), the red-dress effect may be moderated by weather con-
ditions and they found that fertility is most predictive of pink or
red clothing choice during colder but not warmer weather.
Prokop and Hromada (2013) did not find support for the
cycle-phase red effect using the counting method to determine
the menstrual phase of women. Eisenbruch, Simmons, and
Roney (2015), however, used hormonal measurements to
assess women's ovulatory timing. Their results supported the
cycle phase effect for red clothing preferences.
Sexual Strategies in Men
Thus far it seems that the physical attractiveness ratings of red
have been examined without paying attention to the potential
role of sexual strategies. Buss and Schmitt (1993) proposed in
their sexual strategies theory that men have evolved distinct
psychological mechanisms that underlie short-term (ST) and
long-term (LT) strategies. A man acting on his ST mating
desires may benefit reproductively by attempting to inseminate
multiple fertile women. Men pursuing a LT strategy, however,
may benefit in reproductive terms by attempting to monopolize
one woman's lifetime reproductive capacity so as to increase
their paternity certainty over any conceived children. In line
with this argument, men typically indicate a preference for
overt sexual availability in women when pursuing a ST mating
strategy (e.g., Oliver & Sedikides, 1992; Regan & Berscheid,
1997; Schmitt, Couden, & Baker, 2001). This preference is
argued to solve the ST adaptive problem for men of gaining
sexual access swiftly and easily, without displaying
Peperkoorn et al. 3
commitment first. In contrast, men who desire a LT partner
prefer women who are sexually exclusive. Their restricted sex-
ual access to other men would solve the LT adaptive problem
of paternity certainty while investing heavily in one's mate and
potential offspring.
ST Red and LT White
Given that red is commonly associated with lust, love, sexu-
ality, and passion (Elliot & Maier, 2012) and that sexual
receptivity has been argued to act as a mediator between red
and sexual attraction, we expect the signaling function of red
to be especially pronounced in a ST mating context. For
example, studies described above indicate that women might
use red clothing to advertise a potential interest in casual sex
by choosing to wear red when imagining being interested in
sex and actually advertising themselves in red clothing on
casual sex dating websites (Elliot & Pazda, 2012). Indeed,
Pazda et al. (2012) predict that the red effect is specific to ST
mate evaluations, and Schwarz and Singer (2013) state that
the red effect should be much stronger in a ST versus LT
mating context.
While such cultural and social associations involving the
color red have been much discussed in recent studies
reviewed above, other associations with different colors do
exist and are worthy of brief consideration, not least because
they are relevant to alternative conditions in tests of the red-
attraction effect, especially to studies exploring context-
dependent effects. For example, the color white can also be
argued to serve an important signaling function. In several
societies, white symbolizes chastity, purity, high virtues, and
innocence (Aslam, 2006; Grieve, 1991; Hutchings, 2004;
Monger, 2004; Philip, 2011). Common expressions include
``whiter than white'' (very pure, honest, and moral), ``pure as
the driven snow,'' and ``white lie.'' Interestingly, John Lyd-
gate's poem King Henry VI's Triumphal Entry into London
(Ford, 2012; circa 1435 CE) includes the sentence ``Alle
cladde in white, in tokne off clennesse, Lyche pure virgynes''
(loosely translated as, ``All were dressed in white, as a sym-
bol of their purity, as if they were pure virgins''). From about
the middle of the 18 century, white became widespread as a
symbol of virginity in western societies (Monger, 2004). Phi-
lip (2011) reports that the word ``white'' is the main collocate
of the word ``wedding.'' Indeed, in modern western societies
(including those tested in this paper) brides typically wear a
white gown. In addition, the white Japanese wedding kimono,
shiro-maku (translated as white and pure, respectively) sym-
bolizes innocence (Dennis-Bryan, Hodgson, & Lockley,
2008). However, in other cultures (e.g., in China, Vietnam,
and India), women typically select a red wedding dress
instead of a white dress, symbolizing pure love, happiness,
and good fortune (Dennis-Bryan et al., 2008; Hutchings,
2004; Monger, 2004). It has been argued that when seeking
a LT mate, an important trait for males to consider for a
woman would be premarital chastity and sexual fidelity,
given the problem of paternity uncertainty (e.g., Buss,
1989, 2003; Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Hence it could perhaps
pay for women to signal these traits in a LT context (see,
e.g., Fisher, 2013). Based on this argument, we might pre-
dict that in many societies (especially many western coun-
tries), men pursuing a LT sexual strategy would find women
in white more attractive due to the color's associations with
purity and chastity. Thus, we select the color white as our
contrast color to red as this color is likely to be associated
with LT interest.
Apart from red and white, other colors have been argued to
carry important color-meaning associations in affiliation con-
texts that may potentially impact opposite-sex evaluations
(e.g., Pazda et al., 2014 have investigated the influence of the
color black). In Color-in-context Theory (Elliot & Maier,
2012), no argument derived from evolutionary theory is pro-
vided for a ``black effect.'' Rather, Pazda et al. (2014) argue
that, in modern societies, black clothing is seen as fashionable
and wearing such fashionable clothes is seen as attractive
(hence the term, ``little black dress''). Indeed, fashionableness
was found to be a mediator for the link between black and
attractiveness (Pazda et al., 2014). Given that black is also seen
as attractive in modern western societies, we select this color as
our control color as it should not differ contingent on the tem-
poral context.
Research Overview
The current research aims to conceptually replicate the red
effect while distinguishing between short- and LT mating moti-
vations. Elliot and Niesta (2008) were the first to investigate
the red-attraction effect. Hence, we selected this study to assess
attractiveness ratings of a woman dressed in white, black, or
red clothing. However, to make a sharper distinction between
attractiveness and sexual attractiveness, we chose to ask parti-
cipants more explicit questions used by Schwarz and Singer
(2013) to assess sexual attractiveness. Lastly, Elliot and Pazda
(2012) were the first to use a scenario methodology to examine
the red effect. In the present study, we use a similar scenario
design that allows us to manipulate short- and LT mating
motivations.
As argued above, we expect a signaling function of red to be
especially pronounced in a ST mating context. In contrast,
white is associated with chastity, purity, and innocence, and
we therefore expect a potential signaling function of white in a
LT mating context. Black has been argued to signal fashion-
ableness and as such it might not be very useful in differentiat-
ing between a LT and ST mating context. This leads us to the
following hypotheses:
1. Women in red are considered the most attractive in both
mating contexts1 (ST, LT) in comparison to black and
white, but especially in a ST context.
2. Women in white are considered more attractive in a LT
context than in a ST context.
3. Women in black are considered equally attractive in a
ST context as in a LT context.
4 Evolutionary Psychology
4. In a LT context, women in white are considered to be
more faithful in comparison to women in red or black.
5. In a ST context, women in red are considered more
sexually attractive than women in white or black.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we tested the above hypotheses in a Dutch
student sample using a picture of a woman in a red, black, or
white shirt. Temporal context was manipulated using a sce-
nario methodology in which participants were randomly
assigned to either the ST or LT mating condition.
Method
Participants
Two hundred and six male participants participated in this
study. Their mean age was 23.67 years (SD ¼ 4.14 years; range
¼ 18­40 years) and 87.6% of participants indicated that they
had the Dutch nationality only (others include Moroccan
Dutch, Turkish Dutch, Surinam Dutch). The sample was
restricted to individuals who indicated that they were hetero-
sexual (n ¼ 204) or bisexual (n ¼ 2) in orientation. Excluding
these two bisexual participants does not alter the conclusions
(see Online Supplementary Material 1A). Participants were
recruited at the main building of the Vrije Universiteit Amster-
dam and received 2 compensation for their participation. This
experiment was approved by the psychology ethics committee
of the university.
Design, Procedure, and Materials
Participants were randomly assigned to one of six between-
subject conditions2 (mating context: ST, LT; color: red, black,
white): ST-red (n ¼ 34), ST-black (n ¼ 37), ST-white (n ¼ 34),
LT-red (n ¼ 33), LT-black (n ¼ 32), and LT-white (n ¼ 36).
After providing informed consent, participants were given a
tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) and a manila folder con-
taining the photo of the woman. Participants were told that the
experiment concerned first impressions of other people. Parti-
cipants were instructed not to open the folder until told to do so
in the questionnaire on the tablet. They could look at the photo
for as long as they felt necessary and completed the experiment
individually. Upon completion students returned the tablet and
manila folder, filled out the reimbursement form, were paid,
and debriefed (via e-mail after data completion had finished).3
The scenarios describing the allocated ST and LT mating
contexts were based on Elliot and Pazda's (2012) scenario
descriptions, as follows:
ST scenario: Imagine that you have decided to make use
of a dating website because you've heard that this is a
good way to find a one-night stand. After indicating
your preferences you've found a match. Open the
folder and view the photo of the woman with whom
you have a match and then answer the following
questions.
LT scenario: Imagine that you have decided to make use
of a dating website because you've heard that this is a
good way to find a partner for a committed relation-
ship. After indicating your preferences you've found a
match. Open the folder and view the photo of the
woman with whom you have a match and then answer
the following questions.
The female photo was selected from the webpage of Amer-
ican Apparel (http://www.americanapparel.net). Our choice of
which specific white, red, or black color to use was based on
the color labels provided by the American Apparel webpage as
representing that particular color in the shirt chosen. The pic-
ture was cropped (16 cm width Â 9 cm height) to include only
the head and upper torso (from above the bust) of an attractive
young woman with brown hair, wearing a plain white T-shirt
(with a round neck) and having a neutral facial expression. The
background color of the cropped image was a very light gray
and the surrounding unprinted area had a plain white color of
the paper itself. In a pilot test with a sample of 101 men from
the Universiteit van Amsterdam, the attractiveness of the
woman was rated as M ¼ 6.84 (SD ¼ 1.18) on a 9-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all attractive) to 9
(extremely attractive). The photo was sent to a professional
photo editing company to digitally color the shirt in red and
black. The image area of the colored T-shirt was approximately
8 cm in width and 2.5­3 cm in height. The photos were printed
on Epson matte white paper using an Epson Stylus Photo R800
color printer. The color parameters for the red shirt (Lightness,
Chroma, hue: LCh[54.2, 70.8, 28.7]) were obtained using a
GretagMacBeth Eye-One Pro spectrophotometer using the
CIELCh color model, which defines color in terms of the para-
meters lightness, chroma, and hue (Fairchild, 2013). Even
though the color parameters for white and black are customa-
rily not reported as these achromatic colors cannot be matched
on chroma or lightness (Elliot & Maier, 2012, p. 77), the fol-
lowing values are obtained for white (LCh [93.4, 6.5, 274.4])
and black (LCh [21.0, 0.4, 14.1]).
Measures
In order to capture more variance and avoid a possible ceiling
effect, an 11-point scale was used for all our dependent mea-
sures ranging from 1 (not at all) to 11 (extremely). The instruc-
tions and questions were presented in Dutch. All participants
evaluated the woman's attractiveness with a scale composed of
the same 2 items used in Elliot and Niesta (2008): ``how attrac-
tive do you think this woman is?'' and ``how pretty do you
think this woman is?'' (a ¼ .88). Students assigned to the ST
scenario answered questions about sexual attraction, using two
of the three sexual attraction items used by Schwarz and Singer
(2013): ``how much do you want to be intimate with this per-
son?'' and ``how much do you want to have sex with this
person?'' (a ¼ .89). In contrast, those assigned to the LT
Peperkoorn et al. 5
scenario answered two questions pertaining to the woman's
perceived faithfulness: ``how faithful do you think this person
is in a relationship?'' and ``how polygamous do you think this
person is in a relationship?'' Internal consistency was unaccep-
tably low (a ¼ .05), possibly due to the fact that the word
``polygamous'' is rarely used in colloquial language. In fact,
two students indicated to the researcher that they were unclear
about this question. Hence, only the first item was used in our
analyses. Furthermore, in line with Elliot and Niesta's (2008)
procedure, participants indicated to what extent the rating of
the woman's attractiveness was influenced by (a) the woman's
facial expression, (b) the woman's clothing, or (c) the color of
the woman's shirt, to probe for respondents' awareness of the
effect of color. Irrespective of condition, all participants
responded to the attitude facet of the revised Sociosexual
Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) to control for differing sexual
attitudes (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; Cronbach's a ¼ .83). An
example item is ``sex without love is OK'' scored from 1
(strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). After answering the
main questions, participants provided demographic informa-
tion (such as age, sexual orientation, relationship status, and
birth country) in addition to some items serving exploratory
purposes (i.e., participant's height, weight, and muscularity),
which are not discussed here. All statistical analyses were con-
ducted with SPSS Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., 2013).
Results and Discussion
Before conducting the analyses, one extreme outlier on the
attractiveness scale was removed during preliminary data
screening (>3 interquartile range [IQR]). This single extreme
score may have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of
the data analysis. However, the removal of data points may also
change the outcome of the analysis. For this reason, we ran the
analysis both including and excluding the extreme outlier.
Including this single outlier does not alter the conclusions (see
Online Supplementary Material 1B).
A 3 (color condition: red, black, white) Â 2 (mating condi-
tion: ST, LT) between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) on
perceived attractiveness was used to assess the first three
hypotheses. The analysis revealed a nonsignificant Color Â
Condition interaction, F(2, 199) ¼ .08, p ¼ .920. The main
effect for condition was also nonsignificant, F(1, 199) ¼ .86,
p ¼ .354. The main effect for color was significant, F(2, 199) ¼
3.17, p ¼ .044, partial Z2 ¼ .03. Participants assigned to the
white condition (M ¼ 7.59, SD ¼ 1.32) rated the woman as
more attractive compared with those in the red (M ¼ 7.06,
SD ¼ 1.44) and black (M ¼ 7.06, SD ¼ 1.45) conditions.
However, Tukey post hoc tests4 did not reveal a significant
difference, both p > .075. Results are shown in Figure 1.
Limiting the sample to other age-groups (i.e., including
participants up to age 35, 30, and 25) did not result in the
predicted red effect (see Online Supplementary Material 1C).
Contrary to our predictions, the woman in red was thus not
deemed the most attractive overall (Hypothesis 1), nor was
there a difference in attractiveness ratings between the LT
context and ST context for the woman in white (Hypothesis
2). In line with Hypothesis 3, women in black were judged
equally attractive across both mating conditions.
To assess whether participants in the LT mating condition
consider the woman in white to be more faithful in comparison
to the woman in red or black (Hypothesis 4), a one-way
ANOVA was conducted with perceived faithfulness as the
dependent variable. The ANOVA did not show a significant
effect for color, F(2, 98) ¼ 1.42, p ¼ .25: the woman dressed in
white (M ¼ 6.70, SD ¼ 1.59) was not rated as significantly
more faithful than the woman dressed in either red (M ¼ 7.08.
SD ¼ 1.52) or black (M ¼ 7.31, SD ¼ 1.36).
Next, in order to evaluate whether participants in the ST
mating condition consider the woman in red to be more sexu-
ally attractive than the woman in black or white (Hypothesis
5), another one-way ANOVA was conducted with sexual
attraction as the dependent variable. The ANOVA was
nonsignificant, F(2, 102) ¼ .23, p ¼ .79, the woman in red
(M ¼ 6.18, SD ¼ 2.03) was not considered to be significantly
more sexually attractive than the woman dressed in either
black (M ¼ 5.84, SD ¼ 2.13) or white (M ¼ 6.08, SD ¼
2.39). All of the above results were qualitatively identical
when controlling for the sexual attitudes facet of the SOI-R
(see Online Supplementary Material 1D) or for relationship
status (see Online Supplementary Material 1E).
Lastly, color was viewed by participants as having the least
influence of the three factors: Mfacial expression
¼ 6.16 (SD ¼
2.02), Mclothing
¼ 4.06 (SD ¼ 2.18), Mcolor
¼ 3.77 (SD ¼ 2.18);
paired samples t-tests indicated that the rating for the influence
of color was significantly lower than those for both the
woman's facial expression, t(205) ¼ 11.61, p < .001, and the
woman's clothing, t(205) ¼ 2.15, p ¼ .03.

6 Evolutionary Psychology
In summary, the results for this experiment were inconsis-
tent with our predictions. Higher attractiveness ratings were not
found for the woman in red. Instead, a marginally significant
white effect on attractiveness emerged. No difference was
found between mating conditions for the woman in white, con-
trary to our hypothesis. Women in white were not perceived to
be more faithful in the LT condition nor were women in red
considered more sexually attractive in the ST condition. Parti-
cipants did indicate, however, that color had the least influence
on their evaluations of the woman. This prompted us to repli-
cate the experiment and further explore the robustness of the
red effect.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate Experiment 1 while
changing the population from Dutch to American participants
and changing the medium through which the survey was admi-
nistered, from a tablet to an online crowdsourcing service:
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com), which
has been shown to generate high-quality data (e.g., Buhrmester,
Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Paolacci & Chandler, 2014). Further-
more, as M-Turk does not by itself differentiate by participant
sex, we devised an additional hypothesis which involved
female participants rating female photographs and reported
feelings of jealousy. It should be noted, however, that our main
focus is on opposite-sex ratings, hence we will not discuss
same-sex effects here (see Online Supplementary Material 2E
and 2F for the results on women rating the female photograph).
Method
Participants
We recruited 191 men (Mage
¼ 30.13 years, SD ¼ 9.78 years,
range ¼ 16­72 years) and 181 women (Mage
¼ 31.98 years,
SD ¼ 11.80 years, range ¼ 18­67 years) as participants in this
study. Participants were predominantly U.S. American (85.8%
U.S. Americans, 3% other, and 11.1% unspecified. Participants
accessed the experiment through Amazon's Mechanical Turk's
channel via Crowdflower (www.crowdflower.com) and
received US$0.25 for their contribution.
Design, Procedure, and Materials
As in Experiment 1, male participants were randomly
assigned to one of six between-subject conditions: ST-red
(n ¼ 33), ST-black (n ¼ 30), ST-white (n ¼ 36), LT-red
(n ¼ 29), LT-black (n ¼ 31), and LT-white (n ¼ 32). This
study was approved by the psychology ethics committee of
the lead author's university.
The welcome screen presented the consent form and
explained the experiment was about first impressions. After
reading the scenario, respondents were presented with the same
photo of the woman from Experiment 1 and could look at the
photo for as long as they felt necessary (display resolution:
1,032 Â 572 pixels). The last sentence of the scenario as
described in Experiment 1 was changed to accommodate for
the different presentation of the female photo: ``Click further to
see the photo of the woman with whom you have a match and
proceed to the following questions.''
Measures
All participants evaluated the woman's attractiveness with the
same 2 items used in the previous experiment (Cronbach's a ¼
.93). Male respondents assigned to the ST scenario answered
questions about sexual attraction, the same as those from
Experiment 1 (a ¼ .95). Male participants assigned to the LT
scenario condition received two questions pertaining to the
woman's perceived faithfulness: ``how faithful do you think
this person is in a committed relationship?'' and ``how likely
is this person to have an affair while in a committed relation-
ship?'' Note that we changed the second question in this experi-
ment as compared to Experiment 1 to avoid possible confusion
about the meaning of the question. Internal consistency for this
scale was satisfactory (a ¼ .72) and so both items were com-
bined in a single measure. The awareness probe and the demo-
graphical items were the same as in Experiment 1. Participants
were asked to indicate the woman's shirt color to control for
color blindness (out of the original 201 male participants
95.02% of men correctly identified the woman's shirt color).
Those who did not correctly indicate the color were excluded
from analyses. In contrast to Experiment 1, we did not employ
the revised sociosexual inventory (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008)
to assess sexual attitudes, due to the need for brevity.
Results and Discussion
Before conducting the analyses, we conducted preliminary data
screening and found one extreme outlier on the attractiveness
scale which was removed from the male analyses (>3 IQR).
Including this outlier does not alter the conclusions (see Online
Supplementary Material 2A). As in the first experiment, we
used a 3 (color condition: red, black, white) Â 2 (mating con-
dition: ST, LT) between-group ANOVA on attractiveness rat-
ings made by men. The analysis revealed a nonsignificant
Color Â Condition interaction, F(2, 184) ¼ .32, p ¼ .730. The
main effect for condition was nonsignificant, F(1, 184) ¼ .26, p
¼ .611. The main effect for color was also not significant, F(2,
184) ¼ .07, p ¼ .931. Consistent with Experiment 1, the woman
in red was not considered the most attractive by men5 (Hypoth-
esis 1), nor was there a significant difference in attractiveness
ratings between the LT context and ST context for the woman
in white (Hypothesis 2). In support of Hypothesis 3, the woman
in black was judged equally attractive by males across both
mating conditions. Results are shown in Figure 2. The conclu-
sions do not change when limiting the sample of male partici-
pants to the age of 35, 30, or 25 years (see Online
Supplementary Material 2B), including only male participants
with a heterosexual orientation (see Online Supplementary
Material 2C), or controlling for men's relationship status (see
Peperkoorn et al. 7
Online Supplementary Material 2D) for this and the subsequent
hypotheses.
To assess whether male participants in the LT mating con-
dition consider the woman in white to be more faithful in
comparison to the woman in red or black, a one-way ANOVA
was conducted with perceived faithfulness as the dependent
variable. The ANOVA was not significant, F(2, 89) ¼ 2.11,
p ¼ .128, the woman dressed in white (M ¼ 7.89, SD ¼ 1.56)
was not considered significantly more faithful than the woman
dressed in either red (M ¼ 7.31, SD ¼ 1.36) or black (M ¼ 7.19,
SD ¼ 1.39).
Further, to evaluate whether male participants in the ST
mating condition consider the woman in red to be more sexu-
ally attractive than the woman in black or white, another one-
way ANOVA was conducted with sexual attraction as the
dependent variable. The ANOVA was nonsignificant, F(2,
96) ¼ .52, p ¼ .598, the woman in red (M ¼ 7.06, SD ¼
3.18) was not considered to be significantly more sexually
attractive than the woman dressed in either black (M ¼ 6.38,
SD ¼ 2.56) or white (M ¼ 6.97, SD ¼ 2.80).
In the awareness probe, color was again viewed as having
the least influence of the three factors on men's judgments of
attractiveness: Mfacial expression
¼ 5.16 (SD ¼ 1.98), Mclothing
¼
4.05 (SD ¼ 2.12), Mcolor
¼ 2.88 (SD ¼ 1.83); paired samples
t-tests indicated that the rating for color was significantly
lower than the ratings for the woman's facial expression,
t(189) ¼ 13.06, p < .001, and the woman's clothing, t(189)
¼ 8.70, p < .001.
In summary, the results for this experiment were again
inconsistent with our predictions: the woman dressed in red
was not rated the most attractive across conditions. No
significant difference was found for the woman in white
between mating contexts. In line with our expectations, there
was no difference between mating conditions for the woman in
black. However, the woman dressed in white was not perceived
to be more faithful in the LT context as compared with other
colors and the woman in red was not considered more sexually
attractive in the ST context. Consistent with Experiment 1,
color had the least influence on participant's ratings of the
woman.
Experiment 3
In the previous experiments the results did not support the
existence of a red effect on mate preferences. Although we
think our design provided a fair test of the proposed hypoth-
eses, it could be argued that differences in experimental design
between our experiments and those in the published literature
were responsible for null effects. We therefore decided to con-
duct a replication of a previous experiment that did find results
indicative of the red effect. We selected experiment 1a in the
paper by Pazda et al. (2012) because they employed Amazon
Mechanical Turk to obtain participants, thus allowing us to
follow an identical procedure. Note that we did not select the
web study by Pazda et al. (2014) as in this study a woman was
presented in a knee-length dress while in Pazda et al. (2012) the
woman was presented in a shirt, a style of dress that is more
comparable to our present studies. In order to obtain the exact
questions and stimulus materials, we contacted the authors
who helpfully sent us all necessary materials. Although Pazda
et al. (2012) included only male participants, we did not
exclude women from this study. This allowed us to compare
potential sex differences in color effects as well as to further
explore the jealousy questions asked in Experiment 2 with a
larger sample size. However, we do not discuss the results of
the jealousy study below as it is beyond the scope of this paper
(see Online Supplementary Material 3A for complete results
on female participants) and support the null findings we report
above for Experiment 2. Again, we set out to investigate
opposite-sex red effects and hence we focus here on the repli-
cation of the Pazda et al. (2012) study, although all results on
female participants are available in Online Supplementary
Material 3A.
Method
Participants
We recruited 433 men (Mage
¼ 29.71 years, SD ¼ 9.40 years,
range ¼ 16­72 years) and 436 women (Mage
¼ 33.92 years,
SD ¼ 11.60 years, range ¼ 16­75 years) as participants in this
study. The majority identified themselves as U.S. American
(88.6% U.S. Americans, 6.1% other, and 5.3% unspecified).
Participants accessed the experiment through Amazon's
Mechanical Turk (advertised via Crowdflower) and received
US$0.25 for their contribution.

8 Evolutionary Psychology
Design, Procedure, and Materials
Following Pazda et al. (2012), male participants were randomly
assigned to one of two between-subject conditions: red (n ¼
215) and white (n ¼ 218). The research procedure (including
statistical methodology) and stimulus material was the same as
described by Pazda et al. (2012). The welcome screen and
instructions were provided by the original authors by sending
us the URL of a forthcoming web study. The participants
entered a welcome screen, stating that the experiment was on
first impressions and would involve viewing a picture of a
female for 5 s, followed by a questionnaire. The indicated time
to complete the study was specified to take less than 10 min.
The instructions read, ``the next screen will display a picture of
a female. Please look at the picture for 5 s, then proceed with
the survey.'' The picture displayed a moderately attractive
young woman with brown hair and a tanned to mid-brown skin
tone. The measurements of the image were 350 Â 450 pixels.
We should note that the informed consent form may differ
between surveys, as the policies differ between universities.
Also, we employed Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com) to admin-
ister the survey, whereas Pazda et al. (2012) may have used
SurveyGizmo (www.surveygizmo.com) as the URL of a forth-
coming web study directed to this platform. Finally, we used a
substantially larger sample size (the original Study 1a had n ¼
11 in the red condition and n ¼ 14 in the white condition).
Measures
As in the Pazda et al. (2012) study, male participants rated the
perceived sexual receptivity of the woman on 4 items (i.e.,
``how sexy is this person acting,'' ``how seductive is this per-
son,'' ``how flirtatious is this person,'' and ``this person is
interested in sex'' summed into a scale a ¼ .92) using a 1 (not
at all) to 9 (extremely) scale. Participants were asked to guess
the purpose of the experiment and to indicate the woman's shirt
color (out of the original 438 male participants, 98.86% cor-
rectly identified the woman's shirt color, resulting in our sam-
ple of 433 men).
Results and Discussion
An independent samples t-test indicated no effect of color on
men's ratings of sexual receptivity, t(431) ¼ À1.23, p ¼ .219.
Participants in the red condition (M ¼ 3.57, SD ¼ 1.82) did not
rate the woman as more receptive than participants in the white
condition (M ¼ 3.79, SD ¼ 1.81), d ¼ À.12 (95% CI LL: À.31;
UL: .07). When asked about the purpose of the experiment, 17
participants mentioned color; however, results did not change
when excluding them from the analyses (see Online Supple-
mentary Material 3B). The conclusion did not change when
limiting the sample to heterosexual participants (see Online
Supplementary Material 3C), limiting participants to the age
of 35, 30, or 25 years (see Online Supplementary Material 3D),
or controlling for relationship status (see Online Supplemen-
tary Material 3E).
Figure 3 depicts a comparison of effect sizes between
studies.
Discussion
We began this study to test for the red effect on attractiveness
and to further extend the increasing literature by distinguishing
between temporal contexts (ST, LT). Contrary to our expecta-
tions, participants' judgments did not differ across color con-
ditions. We shall discuss each hypothesis separately in light of
the results from the first two experiments.
First, we hypothesized that the woman in red should be rated
by men as the most attractive compared to the same woman in
white or black, especially so in a ST mating context. The results
from the first two experiments do not support our hypothesis:
there is no significant difference between attractiveness ratings
of the woman in the three different colors. Second, it was
predicted that women in white would receive higher attractive-
ness ratings in a LT context as opposed to a ST mating context.
The results do not provide support for the hypothesis: there is
no difference between temporal contexts for the woman in
white. Third, the woman in black was expected to be equally
attractive in a short- or LT context. This expectation is sup-
ported by our results. The aforementioned findings from the
first two hypotheses are at odds with previous research manip-
ulating shirt color where red is contrasted with white and black
(i.e., Pazda et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2010): in these studies, a
stimulus woman in a red or black shirt was found to be signif-
icantly more attractive than the same woman dressed in white.
However, other studies also failed to find a significant differ-
ence between attractiveness ratings of a woman dressed in red
versus white (e.g., Lynn, Giebelhausen, Garcia, Li, & Patuma-
non, 2016).
Fourth, we predicted that men in the LT mating context
would rate the woman in white to be more faithful than the

same woman dressed in red or black. We do not find support for
our hypothesis. To our knowledge, no previous research has
investigated the ``white effect'' on faithfulness so we cannot
compare our results with other studies.
Finally, we hypothesized that in a ST mating context, a
woman in red clothing would receive higher sexual attractive-
ness ratings as compared to the same woman in white or black
clothing. The hypothesis is not supported by the results. Until
now, there has been no study investigating sexual attractiveness
where a woman dressed in red is compared with a woman
dressed in black. However, one recent study by Wen et al.
(2014) measured sexual attractiveness in men and women rat-
ing the opposite sex in red, blue, and white apparel. The red
effect on sexual attractiveness emerged for feminine women
rated by male participants. In addition, higher sexual attractive-
ness ratings have been found in a study manipulating shirt color
using blue (Elliot & Niesta, 2008, Study 5) or green (Pazda
et al., 2012, Study 2) as a contrast color. In addition, studies
investigating sexual receptivity (Gu´
eguen, 2012b; Pazda et al.,
2012, Study 1; Pazda et al., 2014) found women in red clothing
to be more sexually receptive compared to women in white
clothing. These studies hint at the possibility that women in
red clothing would be evaluated as more sexually attractive as
compared to women in white clothing; however, we do not find
support for such a prediction.
The consistent null findings from our first two studies
prompted us to conduct a direct replication of a study (Pazda
et al., 2012, Study 1a) that did find support for the red effect in
men rating a woman on sexual receptivity. Contrary to Pazda
et al. (2012), we did not find any evidence for the original
study's higher sexual receptivity ratings for the woman in red
clothing over the woman in white clothing, even though we
sampled from the same study population, employed identical
questions, displayed the same photo materials, utilized the
same medium through which to administer the survey, ana-
lyzed the data using the same statistical tests, and used a sample
size (N ¼ 433) more than 17 times as large than used in the
original study (N ¼ 25; d ¼ .86, [95% CI LL: .03; UL: 1.68]).
The lack of evidence for a red effect in our three experiments
therefore leads us to question the robustness of the red effect in
human mate preferences. Consistent with our results are two
large studies on the red effect in the affiliation domain, which
also failed to find evidence of the red effect (i.e., Lynn et al.,
2016, N ¼ 1,075; Elliot & Maier, 2013, N ¼ 144; the latter
being a reply to Francis (2013) on publication bias in this
research area), although note that Pazda et al. 2014 (N ¼
361) did find support for both a red effect (mediated through
sexual receptivity) and a black effect (mediated through fash-
ionableness) on attractiveness ratings.
Small studies are likely to end up in a file drawer as com-
pared to large studies when they fail to find significant results
(Button et al., 2013). This may also apply to investigations
within color research into the red effect where many attempts
may not have led to publications. Indeed, it would be in line
with The ``Many Labs'' Replication Project (Klein et al., 2016),
when significantly stronger effect sizes are found for the
original research group (i.e., the investigators who first
reported the red effect (Elliot & Niesta, 2008), than publica-
tions by independent scholars over the next decades. However,
differences in obtained effect sizes between laboratories could
be based on methodological variations such as by using differ-
ent chromatic color comparisons or variations in chroma and
lightness (Elliot, 2015). Conducting research on the psycholo-
gical effects of color requires understanding of the complex-
ities involved in generating appropriate stimulus materials.
However, it should be noted that such differences should lead
to increased noise in the data: causing overestimations of the
red effect at one instance and underestimations of the red effect
at other instances. It is possible that null findings, in particular,
are not shared within the scientific community. The value of
sharing null findings and replicating experiments to arrive at a
better understanding of the influence of color on attractiveness
has been illustrated by Seguin and Forstmeier (2012). It has
been presumed in behavioral ecology for some time that red-
color bands affect male courtship rates in zebra finches (Tae-
niopygia guttata). Seguin and Forstmeier (2012) demonstrate
with meta-analytic techniques that the influence of color bands
appears to be a false positive.
The current study has several potential limitations, some of
which are shared by the studies it sought to replicate. In the first
experiment, we used a tablet to administer the survey, which
might be an unfamiliar way to respond to survey questions on
mate preferences. Participants in Experiments 1 and 2 could
look at the picture for as long as they felt necessary, which
differs from some other studies investigating the red effect
(e.g., Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Pazda et al., 2014; Schwarz &
Singer, 2013) where participants are instructed to look at the
photo for 5 s. However, it should be noted that in our close
replication, Experiment 3, we used the same procedure as
Pazda et al. (2012) and found no support for the hypothesis.
We also believe the theoretical and practical significance of the
red effect would be limited if the red effect could only emerge
with an exposure time of less than 5 s. More studies are how-
ever needed to determine if the red effect is bounded by view-
ing time (especially over 5 s). Similarly, in line with previous
work, we presented just one female target to investigate the red
effect in Experiments 1 and 2 (the same target in both experi-
ments), which does not allow us to compare different women
who might vary, for instance, in skin tone and hair color. How-
ever, it should be noted that also no red effect was found in
Experiment 3, using a photo of a different woman with a darker
skin tone (as compared to the woman in the other experiments)
and that this photo was used before. Future studies may present
participants with a large set of photographs of diverse models
to control for idiosyncrasies of the depicted models. For
instance, a recent study by Young (2015) presented participants
with 40 images to investigate the influence of baseline attrac-
tiveness on the red effect. The red effect emerged for female
faces prerated as attractive but not for unattractive female
faces. Our Experiments 1 and 2 used a photograph of a woman
from the website of American Apparel. Given that the woman
is a model, the probability of finding supportive evidence for
10 Evolutionary Psychology
the red effect in these experiments should be higher compared
to an average looking woman.
We also used a between-subject design in which the target
woman was seen in different colors by different men, rather
than a within-subject design in which the same raters saw the
target in different colors (see, e.g., Roberts et al., 2010). How-
ever, it should be noted that other papers reporting significant
red effects also use between-subject designs, including the
studies we sought to conceptually replicate (Experiments 1 &
2) or closely replicate (Experiment 3). Given the paucity of
color research employing a within-subject design, future
research might benefit from a combination of both designs in
a single paper so as to guarantee good methodological practice.
Even though we did not find evidence of the red effect in our
experiments, there might in fact be a red effect outside the
laboratory due to psychological effects on the wearer, possibly
feeling more desirable in red and behaving in a more attractive
manner (Roberts et al., 2010).
We initially set out to replicate and extend research docu-
menting the red effect on attractiveness. To our surprise, how-
ever, we found no support for the red effect in our empirical
studies. In other words, we did not find support for the premise
that color affects psychological functioning in the affiliation
domain: the women in red were not deemed more attractive
than women in white or black clothing (Experiments 1 and 2)
or more sexually receptive compared to only white clothing
(Experiment 3). The finding that the red effect does not emerge
when contrasted with black is a challenge to color-in-context
theory, as there is a clear theoretical rationale for a positive red
effect (rooted in biology and culture), but such an elaborate
explanation is lacking for a black effect, which is seen as fash-
ionable and hence attractive (see Pazda et al., 2014). Future
research might benefit from exploring why black clothing does
not lead to substantially different effects from red clothing
(Roberts et al., 2010), and we suggest that it would be desirable
to incorporate black as a standard control condition in research
on mate preferences and color.
Future research might further investigate the robustness of
the red effect using large samples. It must be said that the
samples for experiments in this research area tend to be small,
instigating what is known as the ``winner's curse'' effect (But-
ton et al., 2013). Perhaps it is even worth considering whether
one aspect, such as shirt color, would be predicted a priori to
have such a dramatic effect on attractiveness (Cohen's d
ranges from 0.73 to 1.55 in Elliot & Niesta, 2008 and from
0.77 to 0.99 in Niesta Kayser et al., 2010). We argue instead
that if red has an effect on human mate preferences, then it is
likely to be small. We also note that in our experiments the
color of clothing was rated as a substantially less important
trait than other aspects for attractiveness, such as facial attrac-
tiveness or clothing.
In summary, we did not find empirical support for the red
effect on attractiveness judgments across three experiments.
We therefore call for more empirical research on the red effect
in romantic contexts, focusing on rigorous hypothesis testing
rather than exploration. We are hopeful that in time larger
studies will be conducted, providing clear answers on the
robustness of the red effect on mate preferences. Future
research on the red effect is needed as it has important impli-
cations for researchers in the domains of sales, advertising
(e.g., Aslam, 2006), politics (e.g., Kramer, 2016), public rela-
tions, and fashion (e.g., Ellinwood, 2011), where such findings
might have applied value. Finally, we hope that our research
provides an incentive for researchers to share their (null) find-
ings, so as to efficiently and effectively allocate resources in
examining and understanding our colorful world.

1. Note that we distinguish perceived physical attractiveness from
sexual attraction in line with Elliot and Niesta (2008) who suggest
that the former refers to a positive judgment regarding the target's
physical appearance, whereas the latter refers to a further desire,
based on this judgment, to become romantically involved with the
woman. In this sense, physical attractiveness will be useful infor-
mation both for men pursuing a short-term mating strategy and for
those pursuing a long-term strategy.
2. The present study aimed to partially replicate and extend the liter-
ature on red effects on attractiveness. Note, however, that by
today's standards the between-subject design we employed in
Experiments 1 and 2 may have too small a sample size per condi-
tion, making the design not particularly robust. However, given
that the reported effect sizes in previous studies range from
medium to large, our sample sizes are still adequate to detect a
medium effect if the effect indeed exists (See Online Supplemen-
tary Material 4 for anticipated power values using G*Power 3.1).
We also reflect on this matter in the General Discussion.
3. Participants in the red condition were asked what the color of
the woman's shirt was to control for color blindness: none of
the heterosexual or bisexual participants were found to be color-
blind.
4. The Tukey post hoc tests provided the following results: Contrast
white versus black: Mean difference ¼ .53, standard error (SE) ¼
.243, p ¼ .075. Contrast white versus red: Mean difference ¼ .53,
SE ¼ .243, p ¼ .075. Contrast red versus black: Mean difference ¼
.00, SE ¼ .241, p ¼ 1.00.
5. Participants assigned to the red condition (M ¼ 7.45, SD ¼ 1.95)
did not rate the woman as more attractive compared to those in the
white (M ¼ 7.57, SD ¼ 1.83) or black (M ¼ 7.47, SD ¼ 1.45)
conditions.
