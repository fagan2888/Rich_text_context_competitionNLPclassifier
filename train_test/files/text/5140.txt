Abstract
Wolfe (2016) responds to my article (Kristja
´nsson, 2015), arguing among other things, that the
differences in slope by response method in my data reflect speed accuracy trade-offs. But when
reaction times and errors are combined in one score (inverse efficiency) to sidestep speed
accuracy trade-offs, slope differences still remain. The problem that slopes, which are thought
to measure search speed, differ by response type therefore remains.

Recently, I argued that the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing that is
often made in visual search studies, based on whether slopes of set size and response time
(RT) are positive or flat, has outstayed it's welcome and may even sometimes hamper
progress (Kristja
´ nsson, 2015).
Wolfe (2016) responded, arguing that wholesale abandonment of slopes would be unwise
given their usefulness. That is a worthy cause, especially had slopes been in any danger. I did
not actually argue against the use of slopes but simply highlighted the theoretical baggage
they tend to carry in the visual search literature. Slopes are obviously a useful tool and can,
for example, be used to measure the rate at which items are processed. Whether they do so in
visual search is debatable, however, and the assumption that they actually do, and are
therefore the true measures of search speed, may yield questionable conclusions.
Wolfe (2016) echoes my warnings about thinking of slopes as measures of actual cognitive
mechanisms and processing levels or types. Slopes are not simple metrics of whether a search
is ``parallel'' or ``serial.'' This assumption is nevertheless often made in the literature. So
Wolfe and I agree that slopes are interpretable and useful but disagree on whether they have
outstayed their welcome in the visual search literature.
Wolfe claims that the most challenging data for the use of slopes as measures of search rate
are changes in slope when only the task is changed (present/absent vs. go/no-go). If slopes are
a measure of search speed, they should not be affected by response type, which was
nevertheless the case in Kristja
´ nsson (2015). Wolfe argues that error rates increase with set

size in the critical conditions that I report, and that this data involve a ``classic speed accuracy
trade-off [SAT].'' Wolfe is right that there is evidence of SATs in the data but the important
question is whether SATs account for all the differences in slope by response method reported
in Kristja
´ nsson (2015).
There is no single agreed upon way of assessing whether SATs account for condition
differences, and a definitive way may not exist (Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011). But any such
assessment must almost certainly involve some convolution of RTs and error rates. Inverse
efficiency scores (IES; Townsend & Ashby, 1978) have been used to combine RTs and error
rates in one score to compensate for differences in error rates (e.g., Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011;
Vandierendonck, 2016). IES involve multiplying mean RT by error rates yielding a single
score (IES ¼ Mean RT/1 À Mean error rate). Slopes of IES and set size can then be
measured. If there are still slope differences between response conditions in Kristja
´ nsson
(2015), then the problem for the RT by set size methodology remains.
Table 1 shows the results of applying IES scores to RTs and error rates in Kristja
´ nsson
(2015) and also to data from Wang, Kristja
´ nsson, and Nakayama (2005) where a similar
slope difference by response method was reported. The IES transform does not affect the
patterns in the results in any fundamental way. For easy conjunction search, there are still
condition differences of 5 ms per added item to the set size. This means that the search is 5 ms
slower per added item for the more traditional present/absent task than the Go No-Go task.
This is also the case for easy conjunction search from Wang et al. (2005). The slope
differences for the difficult conjunction search are, however, smaller than in the original
data. In sum, SATs do not easily account for slope differences by response method
suggesting that slopes are not straightforward measures of search rate.
There are also notable intercept differences. Intercept differences are often ignored in
visual search studies, based on the assumption that they involve a separate processing
stage from the actual search (Sternberg, 1969), which also relies on the questionable
assumption that slopes are the true measure of search. In any case, outright dismissal of
intercept differences as irrelevant to visual search is unhelpful, but further speculation is
beyond the current scope.
In the end, I do not think that Wolfe and I disagree on very much. And we agree that task-
based differences in slope are a challenge to the RT Â Set size methodology. We may disagree
on whether SATs account for the task-based slope differences, but I think that the current
analysis makes clear that they cannot easily be dismissed as SATs.
There are likely other ways of assessing SATs, but it is hard to see that they would involve
anything else than taking both error rates and RTs in to account as inverse efficiency scores
do, although weights assigned to each could be varied.

This issue deserves more detailed analysis. Inverse efficiency scores are not uncontroversial
and carry a number of assumptions (Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011; Vandierendonck, 2016).
Recent studies highlight the usefulness of analyzing RT distributions (Antoniades et al.,
2013; Burnham, Cilento, & Hanley, 2015; Kristja
´ nsson & Jo
´ hannesson, 2014; Palmer,
Horowitz, Torralba, & Wolfe, 2011; Wolfe, Palmer, & Horowitz, 2010). Testing whether
RT distributions differ by response method could shed further light on the issue.
Currently, my coworkers and I are collecting large data sets with varied response methods
that will enable such detailed analyses.
