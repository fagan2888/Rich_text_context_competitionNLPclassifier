Abstract
Low circulating pyridoxal 59-phosphate (PLP) concentrations have been linked to inflammatory markers and the occurrence
of inflammatory diseases. However, the implications of these findings are unclear. The measurement of PLP and
C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood samples collected from participants in the 2003­2004 NHANES afforded us the opportunity
to investigate this relationship in the general U.S. population. Dietary and laboratory data were available for 3864 of 5041
interviewed adults, 2686 of whom were eligible (i.e. provided reliable dietary data and were not diabetic, pregnant,
lactating, or taking hormones or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs). Vitamin B-6 intake was assessed using 2 24-h diet
recalls and supplement use data. After multivariate adjustment for demographics, smoking, BMI, alcohol use, antioxidant
vitamin status, intakes of protein and energy, and serum concentrations of creatinine and albumin, high vitamin B-6 intake
was associated with protection against serum CRP concentrations .10 mg/L compared with #3 mg/L. However, plasma
PLP $20 nmol/L compared with ,20 nmol/L was inversely related to serum CRP independently of vitamin B-6 intake (P ,
0.001). Among participants with vitamin B-6 intakes from 2 to 3 mg/d, the multivariate-adjusted prevalence of vitamin B-6
inadequacy was ,10% in participants with serum CRP #3 mg/L but close to 50% in those with serum CRP . 10 mg/L
(P , 0.001). In conclusion, higher vitamin B-6 intakes were linked to protection against inflammation and the vitamin B-6
intake associated with maximum protection against vitamin B-6 inadequacy was increased in the presence compared to
absence of inflammation. J. Nutr. 140: 103­110, 2010.
Introduction
Low vitamin B-6 status has been linked in studies to cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD)6 (1­6). The vitamin acts as a cofactor for
.100 enzymes involved in such diverse processes as macromo-
lecular metabolism, immune competence, hormone function,
heme biosynthesis, and the synthesis and catabolism of sphin-
golipids and neurotransmitters (7). Consequently, causal con-
nections between low vitamin B-6 status and age-related diseases
such as CVD, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cancer are
plausible.
Thus far, most interest in vitamin B-6 as a disease-preventive
factor has focused on its role in homocysteine (Hcy) transsul-
furation. However, vitamin B-6 status is now known to be a
comparatively weak determinant of the Hcy concentration
(4,8,9) and studies have shown that the connection between low
vitamin B-6 status and CVD is independent of Hcy (3,4,10,11).
Forty-five years ago, McKusick et al. (12) discovered that
patients with rheumatoid arthritis had decreased excretion of
pyridoxine, a form of vitamin B-6. Along with people affected by
other chronic inflammatory conditions (13,14), such patients are
at high risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD (15,16). In
fact, CVD (17,18) and other age-related chronic diseases (19­
21) are increasingly viewed as inflammatory and inflammation is
considered to be central to the aging process (20,22). Low
plasma concentrations of pyridoxal 59-phosphate (PLP), the
biologically active form of vitamin B-6, in patients hospitalized
for myocardial infarction could reflect an acute phase reaction.
Specifically, vitamin B-6 is required for production of the
cytokines (23) that are among the primary mediators of chronic
inflammation (24) as well as for the proliferation/activation of
lymphocytes that characterizes the inflammatory response
(25,26). In fact, some studies demonstrated a transient lowering
of plasma PLP after myocardial infarction (5,27). Furthermore,
previous studies from our laboratory and elsewhere favored the
hypothesis that plasma PLP concentrations were lowered by
inflammation over the idea that low vitamin B-6 status increases
the risk of inflammation or inflammatory diseases (28­30).

These findings generate the hypothesis that people experiencing
inflammation require higher vitamin B-6 intakes than people not
experiencing inflammation to maintain adequate circulating PLP
concentrations and thus prevent the effects of vitamin B-6
deficiency. However, the above-described reverse causation
scenario could not explain associations that have been reported
between low vitamin B-6 intake and inflammatory markers
(31,32) and CVD risk (3,4).
The NHANES collects data on nutrient intakes from diet and
supplements. Furthermore, the inflammatory marker C-reactive
protein (CRP) is routinely measured in serum samples. Plasma
PLP measurements were also obtained for .7000 NHANES
2003­2004 participants. Using these data, we evaluated asso-
ciations between both vitamin B-6 intakes and plasma PLP
concentrations and serum CRP concentrations. We also inves-
tigated the question of whether the vitamin B-6 requirement is
affected by inflammation by determining the vitamin B-6 intake
associated with minimal prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy
in different serum CRP strata.
Materials and Methods
Participants. The NHANES monitors the nation's health and nutri-
tional status via a continuous annual survey (33). Selection of a
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian popula-
tion is accomplished using a complex multistage probability design. To
increase the precision of estimates derived from the survey, adolescents,
the elderly, Mexican-Americans, and Blacks are oversampled. The
protocols for conduct of the NHANES were approved by the institu-
tional review board of the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC,
and informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Trained interviewers used a computer-assisted personal interview
system to interview participants in their homes. During the home visit,
participants were asked to produce all dietary supplements, prescription
drugs, and nonprescription pain relievers they were taking. In the
NHANES 2003­2004, 10,122 participants were interviewed and asked
to report to a mobile examination center (MEC) to provide further
interview data and undergo a physical examination that included
phlebotomy, body composition assessment, and blood pressure measure-
ments. A detailed description of blood collection and processing can be
found in the NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (34). Female
participants were interviewed regarding reproductive history at the MEC.
Questions concerned age at menarche, menopausal status, and history of
oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy.
MEC-examined participants aged .19 y numbered 4742. PLP
measurements were obtained for 4454 of them (95%). From the 3926
with reliable dietary data for both diet recalls, we excluded 470 who had
been diagnosed with diabetes or whose diabetes status was unclear. After
additional exclusions for pregnancy (n = 172), breast-feeding (n = 23),
hormone replacement therapy (n = 102), and use of oral contraceptives
(n = 94) or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (n = 43), complete data for
analyses were available for between 2653 and 2686 participants,
depending on the model covariates.
Estimation of usual intake of vitamin B-6 and other nutrients.
Beginning with the 2003­2004 NHANES, 2 d of dietary intake data
were collected (35). The first day's data were collected in a 24-h recall
interview conducted at the MEC. A second 24-h recall interview was
conducted by telephone 3­10 d after the MEC examination. The 2
dietary interviews were administered by trained staff and the USDA's
Food Surveys Research Group was responsible for the dietary data
collection methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and
process the data, and data review and processing.
The availability of results from the 2 24-h recalls allowed us to
estimate each participant's usual intake of vitamin B-6, protein, and
energy using methods and computer programs developed by the
National Cancer Institute (36). The National Cancer Institute method
uses the repeat diet assessments to estimate the day-to-day variability in
intakes as well as the correlation between intakes reported over
consecutive days and changes in diet between weekdays and weekend
days.
If the participant had used vitamins, minerals, or other dietary
supplements within 30 d of the interview, the interviewer recorded
information on the amount taken per use and the frequency and duration
of use (37). The amount of each ingredient in each product used was
determined by matching the name and manufacturer of the supplement
to those in a database developed by the National Center for Health
Statistics in collaboration with the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements.
The information in the database came from sources such as the
manufacturer or retailer, the Internet, and company catalogs. We used
the various dietary supplement files to identify all participants who
reported using any supplemental source of vitamin B-6 and to determine
each such participant's usual daily intake of vitamin B-6 from supple-
ments. This amount was added to the estimated usual intake of vitamin
B-6 from food to yield the total daily vitamin B-6 intake for participants
who used supplemental vitamin B-6.
Laboratory analyses. Plasma PLP was measured by A/C Diagnostic-
susing a homogeneous, nonradioactive, enzymatic assay (38). The
following statistics were reported: mean intra-assay CV, 8%; mean inter-
assay CV, 12­13%; detection limit, 10.09 nmol/L; and normal range,
20­120 nmol/L (34). Plasma PLP $20 nmol/L was also the definition of
vitamin B-6 adequacy used to set the current Estimated Average
Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances of vitamin B-6
(39). Results below the detection limit of the assay were replaced with
the value 7.1 nmol/L (i.e. the detection limit divided by the square root of
2) (40).
Serum CRP was assayed at the University of Washington Medical
Center Department of Laboratory Medicine using a Dade Behring
Nephelometer II Analyzer system (Dade Behring Diagnostics). The
detection limit of the assay was 0.2 mg/L (CV ,7.5%). Results below the
detection limit were coded 0.1 mg/L. CRP has been called the classic
acute-phase reactant and has been advocated for following disease
activity in inflammatory conditions (41). The reference range is 0­10
mg/L (41) and we divided participants into 3 groups as follows: #3
mg/L, 3.1­10 mg/L, and .10 mg/L.
Creatinine and albumin concentrations were measured in serum
samples by Collaborative Laboratory Services, using the Beckman
Synchron LX20 modular chemistry side.
Serum vitamin C (HPLC with an internal standard and electrochem-
ical detection), folate, and vitamin B-12 (Quantaphase II Folate/Vitamin
B-12 Radioassay kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and plasma Hcy (Abbott
Diagnostics, fully automated Hcy fluorescence polarization immunoas-
say) were assayed at the NHANES central laboratory, the Inorganic
Toxicology and Nutrition Branch of the National Center for Environ-
mental Health's Division of Laboratory Sciences in Atlanta, GA. HPLC
with multi-wavelength photodiode-array absorbance detection was used
by Craft Technologies to assay vitamins E and A and the carotenoids.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using
SUDAAN release 10.0 (Research Triangle Institute) with appropriate
masked variance units (i.e. pseudoprimary and pseudostratum) and 2-y
sampling weights to account for the survey's complex sampling design
(42). P , 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.
We first used multivariate-adjusted means (95% CI) and proportions
(6 SE) generated by SUDAAN PROC REGRESS and SUDAAN PROC
CROSSTAB to describe and compare participants stratified by CRP
concentration and vitamin B-6 adequacy according to various partici-
pant characteristics, including demographic factors, BMI (weight/
height2), blood pressure, dietary and lifestyle factors, plasma Hcy, serum
concentrations of creatinine and vitamins, and use of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). An NSAID user was any participant
who reported regular use of a prescription drug classified as an NSAID in
the prescription drug data file (43) or any of the following nonprescrip-
tion products: aspirin, Ibuprofen, Excedrin, Vanquish, Feldene, Voltarin,
Clinoril, Indocin, Naprosyn, Alleve, and Tolectin. The multivariate
model (model 1) used for these analyses included terms for basic
demographic factors (i.e. age, sex, and race-ethnicity), correlates of

vitamin B-6 intake and status (i.e. usual intakes of energy and protein)
(44), and factors that have been linked to inflammation in studies (i.e.
indicators of an unhealthy lifestyle) (45) (e.g. smoking and alcohol use),
BMI, and serum creatinine (46). The distributions of serum concentra-
tions of creatinine and vitamins were highly skewed and these values
were logarithmically transformed before use as outcome variables in the
regression models. Differences among groups in subject characteristics
were evaluated using the Wald F test reported from the regression
modeling programs.
Next, we considered whether use of supplements containing vitamin
B-6, total vitamin B-6 intakes, and plasma PLP concentrations were
related to protection against elevated serum CRP concentrations.
Although our hypothesis regarding plasma PLP and inflammation was
bi-directional, in the interest of consistency with the analyses relating
supplement use and vitamin B-6 intakes to serum CRP concentrations,
we performed these analyses using multinomial multiple logistic regres-
sion as performed by SUDAAN PROC MULTILOG, with the 3-level
term for serum CRP as the categorical outcome variable. We estimated
the odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) using model 1 described above, and, to
simultaneously adjust for additional potentially confounding factors,
after adding terms for serum concentrations of folate, albumin, and
antioxidant vitamins (model 2). We also performed these analyses after
adjusting for plasma PLP. This step was aimed at evaluating the
specificity of the association for vitamin B-6 status, because supplements
contain vitamins other than vitamin B-6 and because high vitamin B-6
intakes may be associated with high intakes of other vitamins. We also
performed the analysis relating plasma PLP category to serum CRP
category after adjusting for total vitamin B-6 intake. The rationale
behind this step was to determine whether the association between
plasma PLP category and serum CRP category was entirely explained
by vitamin B-6 intake or whether some of the association might
be a reflection of the influence of inflammation on the plasma PLP
concentration.
To shed light on the hypothesis that inflammation increases the need
for vitamin B-6 via increased utilization of the vitamin in the inflam-
matory process, we attempted to determine whether the vitamin B-6
intake that was associated with maximal prevention of vitamin B-6
inadequacy varied with inflammation status. To accomplish this, we used
SUDAAN PROC REGRESS and model 2 described above to estimate,
for participants in highest and lowest serum CRP categories, the
multivariate-adjusted prevalence (95% CI) of vitamin B-6 inadequacy
associated with total vitamin B-6 intakes of ,2, 2­2.9, 3­4.9, and
$5 mg/d.
P-trend for associations between vitamin B-6 intake and study
outcomes was estimated using the medians of the vitamin B-6 intake
categories modeled as a continuous exposure variable.
Results
Participant characteristics in relation to serum CRP and
plasma PLP concentrations. Female gender, current smoking,
and low serum concentrations of albumin and a variety of
vitamins were positively associated with both inflammation and
vitamin B-6 inadequacy (Table 1). Age was not related to either
study outcome in men. However, after multivariate adjustment,
women with elevated CRP concentrations were somewhat older
than women with CRP concentrations in the reference range and
women with inadequate vitamin B-6 status were somewhat
younger than women with adequate status.
Non-Hispanic Black race-ethnicity and higher Hcy concen-
trations were associated with inadequate vitamin B-6 status and
BMI was positively related to inflammation.
Markers of vitamin B-6 status in relation to serum CRP
concentration. After multivariate control for demographic
characteristics, lifestyle factors, BMI, serum creatinine, and
intakes of energy and protein, use of supplements containing
vitamin B-6 was associated with protection against markedly
elevated CRP concentrations compared with CRP concentra-
tions in the reference range (Table 2). This association was
greatly attenuated by adjustment for either plasma PLP or serum
concentrations of albumin and other vitamins found to be
associated with protection against inflammation in preliminary
analyses. These results suggest that the association between
vitamin supplement use and protection against inflammation is
partially mediated by vitamin B-6 status and partially by other
vitamins contained in the supplements.
The odds of a markedly elevated CRP concentration,
compared with a concentration within the reference range,
decreased significantly with increasing vitamin B-6 intakes from
dietary sources and supplements combined. The magnitude of
the inverse association between vitamin B-6 intake and this
outcome decreased after terms for serum concentrations of
folate, albumin, and antioxidant vitamins were added to the
model. However, consuming at least 5 mg/d of vitamin B-6, as
opposed to consuming ,2 mg/d, remained significantly related
to protection against a markedly elevated CRP concentration in
all models except the one that controlled for plasma PLP
concentration. In other words, the association between higher
vitamin B-6 intake and protection against a markedly elevated
serum CRP concentration did not appear to be effected by
confounding by other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore,
the OR obtained using model 2 additionally adjusted for plasma
PLP was identical to that obtained using model 1 additionally
adjusted for plasma PLP (i.e. OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.35­1.24).
Finally, even after controlling for all of the potentially con-
founding factors and vitamin B-6 intake from foods and
supplements combined, the OR relating a plasma PLP concen-
tration $20 nmol/L compared with ,20 nmol/L to both
moderately elevated and markedly elevated serum CRP concen-
trations were significantly ,1.0. That is, vitamin B-6 intake did
not entirely explain the association between the plasma PLP
concentration and inflammation status, which leaves open
the possibility that inflammation also lowers the plasma PLP
concentration.
Relationship between vitamin B-6 intake and vitamin B-6
inadequacy by inflammation status. The prevalence of
vitamin B-6 inadequacy decreased with increasing vitamin B-6
intake regardless of serum CRP concentration (Fig. 1). Specif-
ically, among participants with CRP concentrations in the
reference range, the prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was
~20% in the subgroup with vitamin B-6 intakes ,2 mg/d (i.e.
the lowest intake category) compared with ,10% among those
in higher vitamin B-6 intake categories (P , 0.01). However, the
prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was much more common
(range, 38­54%; P , 0.01) among participants with serum CRP
.10 mg/L and vitamin B-6 intakes ,5 mg/d (i.e. all intake
categories except the highest). In other words, whereas the
prevalence of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was minimized at vitamin
B-6 intakes $2 mg/d in participants with serum CRP #3 mg/L, a
comparably low prevalence of inadequacy was observed only at
much higher vitamin B-6 intakes among participants whose
serum CRP concentrations were markedly elevated.
Discussion
Our study was primarily aimed at confirming in a large
population-based survey a link between the plasma PLP
concentration and inflammation status. We also aimed to shed
light on the direction of the relationship by evaluating the
association between vitamin B-6 intake and inflammation and

investigating how vitamin B-6 intake related to vitamin B-6
inadequacy as inflammation status varied. The cross-sectional
design of our study did not permit causal inference. However, we
found results that would be expected if higher vitamin B-6
intakes protected against inflammation. We also found results
that would be expected if inflammation resulted in an increased
need for vitamin B-6.
Previous studies showed that low plasma PLP concentrations
were characteristic of people with inflammatory conditions
(29,47,48). Furthermore, inverse relationships have been found
between vitamin B-6 status and markers of inflammation in
animal models (49), patient groups (46­48,50), and general
population samples (28,31,51). A cross-sectional association
between low plasma PLP concentrations and inflammation
could mean that vitamin B-6 protects against inflammation or
that inflammation adversely affects vitamin B-6 status. How-
ever, 1 population-based study found no association at all (11).
Moreover, some of the positive studies, including the popula-
tion-based Framingham Study (28), did not link vitamin B-6
intakes to inflammation status (28,31). Such results argued
against an antiinflammatory role for higher vitamin B-6 status.
In contrast to those studies, our study did link higher vitamin B-6
intakes to decreased odds of inflammation and results suggested
that the association was not confounded by other aspects of a
healthy lifestyle. That the association did not remain after the
plasma PLP concentration was adjusted for further illustrates
the specificity of the association for vitamin B-6 status. The
difference between our results and those reported in the
Framingham study may relate to a difference in exposure,
because the data used in the Framingham investigation were

collected in the late 1980s, when the use of supplements was
much less common than it is today (52). The mechanism by
which low vitamin B-6 status might foster inflammation, or
certain inflammatory diseases such as CVD, is unclear. Hcy has
been proposed as a likely mediator (53). However, cross-
sectional studies, including our own, have found the inverse
association between vitamin B-6 status and CRP to be indepen-
dent of Hcy (28,31,51). Studies have also failed to support the
idea that Hcy mediates the association between low vitamin B-6
status and vascular disease (10,54). Consistent with those
results, low vitamin B-6 status remains a risk factor for CVD
in the age of food folate fortification (32), but Hcy does not (55).
If the cross-sectional association between vitamin B-6 intake
and inflammation status reflects a causal relationship, the
possibility that inflammation adversely affects vitamin B-6
status is not necessarily ruled out. Indeed, the association
between the plasma PLP concentration and the serum CRP
concentration remained strong in our study even after vitamin
B-6 intake was adjusted for. Although the finding could still
reflect protection against inflammation by higher vitamin B-6
intakes if plasma PLP were a better indicator of intake than the
24-h diet recall data, an adverse effect of inflammation on
vitamin B-6 availability is plausible. Specifically, vitamin B-6 is
needed for the cytokine production (23) and lymphocyte prolif-
eration (25,26) that characterize the inflammatory response. On
the other hand, some evidence suggests that the low plasma PLP
concentrations observed in the presence of inflammation do not
reflect low vitamin B-6 status. Specifically, McMillan et al. (56­
59) have repeatedly shown that critically ill people experiencing
inflammation have low plasma PLP concentrations but normal
erythrocyte PLP concentrations. Studies in our laboratory have
corroborated this finding (47,50) and demonstrated no correla-
tion between the plasma PLP concentration and indicators of
vitamin B-6 status in erythrocytes (50). We did, however, find
that the plasma PLP concentration reflected the availability of
vitamin B-6 during metabolic challenges (e.g. methionine and
tryptophan loads) better than erythrocyte PLP did (50). The low
plasma PLP concentrations observed during inflammation could
result from increased vitamin B-6 utilization in the liver at the
same time that vitamin B-6 is used normally in erythrocytes.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is a marker of poor vitamin B-6
function, because vitamin B-6 serves as a cofactor in the
conversion of Hcy to cysteine. In the current study, ,6% of the
participants with serum CRP concentrations in the reference
range had plasma PLP concentrations below the detection
limit of the assay compared with 30% of those with serum

CRP . 10 mg/L. The OR relating such a low plasma PLP
concentration to a serum Hcy concentration .12 mmol/L was
7.29 (P = 0.006) in the group with markedly elevated serum CRP
concentrations after controlling for demographic factors, smok-
ing status, and serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B-12, and
creatinine. That finding illustrates the clinical relevance of the
low plasma PLP concentrations that occur in connection with
inflammation.
The vitamin B-6 intake associated with maximal prevention
of vitamin B-6 inadequacy among participants with normal
serum CRP was $2 mg/d compared with the current Recom-
mended Dietary Allowance for adults of 1.3­1.7 mg/d (39).
These findings may be consistent with depletion/repletion
studies suggesting that the vitamin B-6 requirement is ~2 mg/d
(60,61). In the subgroup with markedly elevated serum CRP
concentrations, the vitamin B-6 intake associated with maximal
prevention of vitamin B-6 inadequacy was even higher. If the low
plasma PLP concentrations associated with inflammation are
clinically relevant, our findings are thus also consistent with the
hypothesis that the vitamin B-6 requirement is increased in the
presence of inflammation.
Preventing inflammation is important because several chro-
nic diseases of considerable public health importance are char-
acterized by chronic inflammation (62). Preventing inflammation
might also help prevent America's number 1 killer, CVD (63),
the risk of which is increased in association with systemic
inflammation and immune-inflammatory disease. The public
health importance of inflammation may actually extend well
beyond its contribution to these conditions, however, because
chronic inflammation is suspected of playing a role in other age-
related diseases, including heart failure, type II diabetes, cancer,
frailty, cognitive decline/dementia, and osteoporosis (64).
An inflammation-induced reduction in the plasma PLP
concentration would be important because of the critical role
that PLP plays in immune function (25,65­68), Hcy catabolism
(69), hemoglobin synthesis (70), neurotransmitter synthesis
(71), and macromolecular metabolism (72,73). It accomplishes
these roles by acting as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes (39).
The strengths of our study included the large sample, the
collection of dietary data in 2 24-h recalls, and the extensive
information on use of drugs and supplements. The comprehen-
siveness of the survey also allowed us to consider many possible
alternative explanations for our findings. Of course, residual
confounding by imperfect measurement of covariates or failure to
control for important but unknown confounders is always
possible. Our study's main limitations were its cross-sectional
design, the availability of a single, nonspecific (74) inflammation
marker, and the lack of high-quality data on chronic inflamma-
tory diseases. Furthermore, despite the improvements in dietary
assessment instituted with the 2003­2004 survey and the devel-
opment of statistical methods to estimate day-to-day variation in
intake around the time of the survey, we may not have captured
the relevant data if diet prior to the survey was important. Finally,
our method of combining the usual intake of vitamin B-6 from
foods with data from the supplement survey instrument assumes
that day-to-day variation in vitamin B-6 intake from supplement
sources is zero, which may not be the case.
In conclusion, our large, general-population study confirmed
the association between inflammation and low plasma PLP
concentration but challenged the notion that vitamin B-6 intake
is unrelated to inflammation. If the associations we found reflect
cause-and-effect relationships, higher vitamin B-6 intakes might
be of value in preventing inflammation and maintaining vitamin
B-6 adequacy when inflammation is present.
