Background--High blood pressure can be controlled through existing antihypertensive drug therapy. This study examined
trends in prescribed antihypertensive medication use among US adults with hypertension and compared drug utilization
patterns with recommendations of the Sixth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
Methods and Results--Persons aged 18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were
identified as hypertensive on the basis of either a blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or self-reported current treatment for
hypertension with a prescription medication. In 1999­2002, 62.9% of US hypertensive adults took a prescription
antihypertensive medication compared with 57.3% during 1988­1994 (P0.01). Men had the greatest increase in
antihypertensive medication use (47.5%, 1988­1994 versus 57.9%, 1999­2002 [P0.001]). In both surveys,
antihypertensive medication use increased with age, was lower among men than among women, and was lower among
Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Multiple antihypertensive drug use increased from
29.1% to 35.8% (P0.001). Polytherapy with a calcium channel blocker, -blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor significantly increased by 30%, 42%, and 68%, respectively, whereas monotherapy with a diuretic or -blocker
significantly decreased. For hypertensives with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or a prior heart attack, the utilization
patterns closely followed the Sixth Joint National Committee guideline recommendations.
Conclusions--Antihypertensive medication use and multiple antihypertensive medication use among US hypertensive
adults increased over the past 10 years, but disparities by sociodemographic factors continue to exist. (Circulation.

Key Words: hypertension  population  drugs
Hypertension or high blood pressure is among the most
common chronic medical conditions, affecting 65
million individuals in the United States.1 Approximately $37
billion is spent annually for medications, office visits, and
laboratory tests related to hypertension treatment.2 In the past
3 decades, hypertension treatment has contributed to a de-
crease in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular dis-
ease. Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Surveys (NHANES) during 1960­1991 indicated an
upward trend in awareness, treatment, and control rates of
hypertension in the United States.3 However, NHANES
1999­2000 data, presented in the Seventh Report of the Joint
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC), showed an
increasing prevalence of hypertension.4 These data also
showed a continued poor blood pressure control rate (35%)
for US hypertensives, which is far below the Healthy People
2010 goal of 50%.5 It is therefore important to understand
current antihypertensive medication utilization patterns and
to study their impact on blood pressure control and
hypertension-related clinical outcomes.
Editorial p 178
A large number of drugs, including diuretics, -blockers,
calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), are available for lowering elevated blood pressures.
These drugs have been shown to reduce hypertension-related
morbidity and mortality.6,7 On the basis of many randomized
clinical trials, the 1997 JNC VI recommended diuretics and
-blockers as the first-line agents for pharmacological treat-
ment of uncomplicated hypertension; listed compelling indi-
cations for CCBs, ACE inhibitors, and -blockers; and
discussed additional favorable clinical indications for these
and other drug classes.7 However, most previous published
data indicated an increasing use of the more expensive CCBs
and ACE inhibitors8­10 despite the lack of evidence to support
that they are superior to diuretics and -blockers in prevent-

ing major forms of cardiovascular disease. To understand
current medication utilization patterns among hypertensives,
this study compared NHANES III (1988­1994) and
NHANES 1999­2002 data to examine trends and patterns of
antihypertensive medication use among US adults with
hypertension.
Methods
The NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 are cross-sectional
surveys designed to select a nationally representative sample of the
civilian noninstitutionalized US population with oversampling of
young children, older persons, black persons, and Mexican Ameri-
cans. Data collected during NHANES III11 are comparable to
NHANES 1999­200212 data. Survey participants received a detailed
in-person home interview, followed by a physical examination
including blood pressure measurements at a mobile examination
center. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the
protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the
National Center for Health Statistics.
During the home interview, participants were asked, "Have you
taken or used any prescription medicines in the past month?"
Respondents who answered affirmatively were further asked to
report the name, duration, and main reason for each product used. An
interviewer recorded the exact product name from the medication
container label. If the container was unavailable, the participant
verbally reported this information. With the use of the JNC VI and
JNC VII list of oral antihypertensive drugs4,7 and the assistance of
pharmacists at the Food and Drug Administration, antihypertensive
agents reported by participants in NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2002 were identified. Any antihypertensive drug use was
defined as a report of using 1 or more of these drugs. Six therapeutic
drug classes including -blockers, CCBs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, and other antihypertensive agents (
1
-blockers, central 
2
-
agonists, direct vasodilators, and other centrally acting drugs) were
classified. A person could have used more than 1 antihypertensive
medication within the past month or an antihypertensive medication
containing more than 1 antihypertensive active ingredient. In both
cases, the person was counted once within each antihypertensive
drug class used. Persons who used an antihypertensive medication
with only 1 active ingredient were defined as receiving monotherapy.
Those taking more than 1 active ingredient (either in 1 combination
pill or in 2 different single pills) were defined as receiving
polytherapy.
Blood pressure was measured with the participant in the sitting
position after 5 minutes of rest by a physician at the mobile
examination center. The average of up to 3 measurements was used.
Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure
140 mm Hg, or a mean diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or
current hypertension treatment with prescription medication (affir-
mative answers to the following sequence of questions: "Has a
doctor ever told you that you had high blood pressure?"; "Because of
your high blood pressure, have you ever been told to take prescribed
medicine?"; and "Are you now taking prescribed medicine?").13
The NHANES III response rate for completion of the interview
and health examination was 78%. Of those, 5003 adults aged 18
years were identified as hypertensive on the basis of the aforemen-
tioned criteria. Seventy were excluded because of missing prescrip-
tion medication data. The final analytic sample was 4933. The
NHANES 1999­2002 response rate for completion of the interview
and health examination was 75%. Of those, 3288 adults aged 18
years were identified as hypertensive, and 39 were excluded because
of missing prescription medication data. The final analytic sample
was 3249.
A history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, stroke, congestive
heart failure, and heart attack was assessed by questionnaire.
Diabetes only presenting during pregnancy was defined as no
diabetes. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated with the use of the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation,14 subtract-
ing 0.23 mg/dL from the NHANES III serum creatinine levels to
adjust for calibration differences between NHANES III and the
MDRD study.15 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as either
an estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or
200 mg albumin per gram urinary creatinine.4 Hypertensives who
had none of the aforementioned 5 comorbidities were categorized as
uncomplicated hypertensives.
Statistical analyses were conducted with the use of SAS (SAS
Institute) and SUDAAN (RTI). Sample weights were used to account
for differential probabilities of selection and the complex sample
design and to obtain estimates representative of the noninstitution-
alized US population aged 18 years. Variance estimates were
computed with the Taylor series linearization approximation ap-
proach.16,17 An estimate with a relative SE 30% was considered
statistically unreliable and noted in the tables. Statistical hypotheses
were tested univariately at the 0.05 level with a t statistic. The
Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons
when differences between age groups were tested (4 comparisons,
0.05/4) and race/ethnicity groups (3 comparisons, 0.05/3).
Tests for differences between the 2 study periods were performed at
the 0.05 level with 2-sample t tests for comparisons of weighted
percentages between the NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002
data.
Because age structures may be different between surveys or
between race/ethnicity groups, we examined the potential impact of
age by the direct age-standardized method in which weights corre-
sponding to the NHANES 1999­2002 hypertensive population were
used to estimate antihypertensive medication use prevalence during
NHANES III. Results in which these adjusted weights were used led
to only minor differences in point and variance estimates without
changing any comparisons in trends across surveys or race/ethnicity
comparisons within surveys. Thus, in this report we present unad-
justed estimates. Additionally, we do not present race/ethnicity
estimates that are age-adjusted to the standard US population
because the age structures of the hypertensive populations for
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 are very different from the
standard US population (specifically, they are significantly older).
By age-standardizing the antihypertensive drug use estimates with
the standard US population, the true prevalence of antihypertensive
medication use would be significantly underestimated. Instead, we
provide unadjusted prevalence estimates that are stratified at multiple
levels to increase the precision of estimates in specific demographic
subgroups.
Results
Table 1 provides baseline characteristics of the sample
populations, weighted to be representative of the US hyper-
tensive adult population. The gender and race/ethnicity dis-
tributions of the hypertensive populations were similar during
1988­1994 and 1999­2002. The average ages of the hyper-
tensive populations were 59.6 years. By 1999­2002, the
percentage of hypertensives aged 50 to 59 years increased,
and those aged 18 to 39 years decreased. The proportions of
hypertensives with stroke, congestive heart failure, or a heart
attack were also similar between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002.
Approximately 70% of hypertensives had none of the 5 major
comorbidities. Compared with NHANES III, the current
hypertensive population had a higher body mass index value,
higher diabetes prevalence, and lower CKD prevalence. Both
the NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 hypertensive
populations had similar mean systolic blood pressure, but
hypertensives in NHANES 1999­2002 had a lower mean
diastolic blood pressure value than those in NHANES III. The
proportion of the hypertensive populations with normal blood
pressure (140/90 mm Hg) significantly increased, whereas
the proportion with stage 1 hypertension significantly de-

(160/100 mm Hg).
Prescription Antihypertensive Medication Use by
Demographic Factors
Between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002, antihypertensive med-
ication use prevalence among hypertensive adults signifi-
cantly increased from 57.3% to 62.9% (Table 2). Antihyper-
tensive medication use increased for men (47.5% versus
57.9%); non-Hispanic whites (58.8% versus 64.5%); non-
Hispanic blacks (56.6% versus 65.2%); and hypertensives
aged 70 years (65.3% versus 70.7%). Specifically, antihy-
pertensive medication use increased for non-Hispanic white
men aged 60 years, non-Hispanic black men aged 50
years, and Mexican American men aged 60 to 69 years. For
women, a significant increase in use was observed only for
Mexican American women aged 70 years (45.3% versus
61.7%).
Overall, during both surveys, antihypertensive medication
use was greater among hypertensive women than men, older
adults than younger persons, and non-Hispanic whites and
non-Hispanic blacks than Mexican Americans. When race/
ethnicity differences were further examined by gender and
age groups, a different pattern emerged. By 1999­2002,
Mexican American men had lower utilization than non-
Hispanic whites at 40 to 59 years of age and non-Hispanic
blacks at 50 to 69 years of age, but there were no differences
by 70 years of age. For women, Mexican Americans had

Drug Classes, Monotherapy Versus Polytherapy
When monotherapy and polytherapy were considered to-
gether, diuretics remained the most commonly used antihy-
pertensive drug class during 1988­1994 (27.8%; Figure 1)
and 1999­2002 (28.7%). Use remained stable across both
time periods for most drug classes, except for ACE inhibitors,
for which there was a significant increase in use (15.2%
versus 23.8%). During 1988­1994, ARBs were not in general
clinical use, but by 1999­2002, ARB use among hyperten-
sive adults had reached 9.0% (SE, 0.71; data not shown).
Overall, antihypertensive polytherapy use among hyperten-
sives increased significantly between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2002 from 29.1% to 35.8% (Figure 1). Specifically, the use of
polytherapies containing a CCB, -blocker, or ACE inhibitor
substantially increased by 30%, 42%, and 68%, respectively.
Between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002, ACE inhibitor mono-
therapy use significantly increased from 6.2% to 8.5%,
whereas monotherapy use of a diuretic or -blocker de-
creased from 4.9% and 7.1% to 2.7% and 5.1%, respectively.
Diuretics (including the use of multiple diuretics or a
diuretic combined with another drug class) remained the most
commonly used polytherapy during both time periods. A
diuretic plus a -blocker, ACE inhibitor, or CCB each
accounted for 20% of all polytherapy medication users,
respectively, in both surveys (Figure 2). Between 1988­1994
and 1999 to 2002, significant increases were only observed
for polytherapies containing an ACE inhibitor. Specifically,
the use of an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic, CCB, or
-blocker significantly increased by 23%, 45%, and 142%,
respectively.
Most Frequently Used Antihypertensive Drugs
During 1988­1994, the diuretic drug triamterene and hydro-
chlorothiazide (a single pill combination) was the most
commonly used antihypertensive agent, with a 14.4% preva-
lence of use among antihypertensive drug users (Table 3).
However, its use significantly declined after 1988­1994 to
7.5%, making it the seventh most commonly used antihyper-
tensive in 1999­2002. Additionally, the use of propranolol,

verapamil, nifedipine, and enalapril maleate also decreased
significantly over the past decade. By 1999­2002, the use of
lisinopril significantly increased from 6.8% to 13.6%, making
this ACE inhibitor the most commonly used antihypertensive
agent, followed by the -blocker atenolol and the diuretic
hydrochlorothiazide. During 1988­1994, only a few hyper-
tensives reported amlodipine besylate use, and a statistically
reliable percentage of use could not be estimated on the basis
of this small sample size. However, by 1999­2002, amlodip-
ine besylate use accounted for 9.2% of all antihypertensive
medication users, making it the fifth most commonly used
antihypertensive medication.
Antihypertensive Drug Use by Comorbidities
During 1988­1994 and 1999­2002, more than three quarters
of hypertensive adults with CKD, diabetes, stroke, or con-
gestive heart failure used an antihypertensive medication,
with no significant differences in overall utilization between
the 2 time periods (Table 4). Antihypertensive medication use
among those with a prior heart attack increased by 10%
(82.2% versus 90.7%), mainly because of a near doubling in
the use of -blockers (24.6% versus 47.9%). -Blocker use
also increased by 93% among those with congestive heart
failure and by 48% among those with CKD. There were also
significant increases in ACE inhibitor use for certain comor-
bidities. Between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002, ACE inhibitor
use increased by 64% among those with CKD, by 86%
among diabetic hypertensives, and by 55% among those with
congestive heart failure.
More than 70% of hypertensives reported none of the 5
major chronic conditions identified above (Table 1): 48.5% of
these persons reported antihypertensive medication use dur-
ing 1988­1994 (Table 4), and this number significantly
increased to 54.6% during 1999­2002 partly because of a
significant increase in ACE inhibitor use (12.2% versus
17.8%).
Discussion
The benefit of blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive
drug treatment has become increasingly evident, with de-
creases in both all-cause mortality and coronary artery dis-
ease as shown by multiple clinical trials and epidemiological
studies, with the greater absolute benefit in older pa-
tients.7,18,19 This study found that antihypertensive medication
use among US hypertensive adults significantly increased
over the past decade, primarily because of an increase in
antihypertensive medication use among men. Older non-
Hispanic white and black men had the greatest increase in
antihypertensive medication use. Increased cardiovascular
disease risk among older men may have contributed to the
increased prescribing of antihypertensive drugs to those aged
60 years.20
Overall, Mexican American hypertensives had lower anti-
hypertensive medication use than non-Hispanic whites or

use by specific age-groups and gender was examined. Spe-
cifically, for women there were minimal race/ethnic dispari-
ties in 1999­2002. The differences that existed at 50 to 69
years of age can be explained by increased use among
non-Hispanic black hypertensive women (80% utilization).
This could indicate that efforts to increase antihypertensive
prescribing and use among non-Hispanic black hypertensive
women have been successful and that similar efforts could be
made with the other groups. For men, although Mexican
American hypertensives aged 60 to 69 years had a significant

and 1999­2002, race/ethnic disparities continued to exist in
this age group as well as at 40 to 59 years of age. Continued
efforts are needed among hypertensive men of all race/ethnic
groups and specifically among the younger age groups.
On the basis of evidence from epidemiological studies and
clinical trials, JNC VI and JNC VII recommended that
diuretics and -blockers be used as first-line antihypertensive
agents for uncomplicated hypertension.4,7 Our study found
that although diuretics were the most frequently prescribed
drug class for management of hypertension during both
surveys, ACE inhibitor use increased markedly. This trend
was also observed among uncomplicated hypertensives. If we
consider ACE inhibitors and ARB as 1 class, that is, as agents
that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system medication use doubled over
this time period, making it the most frequently used drug
class in 1999­2002. In contrast, monotherapy with diuretics
or -blockers significantly decreased over the past decade.
The rising use of ACE inhibitors may be explained by their
substantial benefits in congestive heart failure and diabetes as
JNC VI recommends this drug class as the first-line treatment
for hypertensives with these conditions.7 However, it is
difficult to explain the increased use among uncomplicated
hypertensives. The decreasing use of diuretics or -blockers
may be explained by physician misperceptions that diuretics
are less effective and that -blockers are less well tolerated
than other medications.21­23
Recently, several large clinical trials demonstrated that
most patients with hypertension can achieve and sustain
adequate blood pressure control only with the use of multiple
antihypertensive drugs.24,25 Initiating drug therapy with a
diuretic, either alone or in combination with an agent from
another drug class, apparently provides the best outcomes for
hypertension management, and these findings have been
incorporated into the current JNC VII guidelines.4 Our study
found that the use of multiple antihypertensive drugs either in
a single combination pill or in 1 pill significantly increased
and accounted for use by more than half of all antihyperten-
sive medication users by 1999­2002. The most common
combinations were a diuretic plus an ACE inhibitor,
-blocker, or CCB. Diuretic polytherapy accounted for
80% of total diuretic use in 1988­1994 and 90% in
1999­2002.
Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure,
coronary heart disease, and end-stage renal disease. Hyper-
tension is also commonly associated with diabetes and
chronic renal failure generally. For management of hyperten-
sives with these comorbidities, both JNC VI and JNC VII
guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors as the preferred drug
for hypertension in the setting of CKD, diabetes, or conges-
tive heart failure; ACE inhibitors or diuretics for recurrent
stroke prevention; and -blockers for those with prior myo-
cardial infarction.4,7 In accordance with these recommenda-
tions, our study found that between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2002, ACE inhibitor use significantly increased in patients
with CKD, diabetes, and congestive heart failure, and
-blocker use significantly increased in patients with a
history of heart attack. Similar prescribing patterns for those
with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or a history of heart
attack were also reported by Mehta et al.26
The percentage of hypertensive adults using antihyperten-
sive drugs reported in this study is different than the hyper-
tension treatment estimates published by Glover et al27 using
NHANES 1999­2002 for several reasons, including differ-
ences in sample exclusion criteria, antihypertensive medica-
tion use definitions, and analysis methods (age-adjusted
versus unadjusted estimates). In the present study we used the
prescription medication data that were collected as part of the
household questionnaire. These data allowed us to identify all
antihypertensive medications used in the past month with
their specific drug names rather than using the self-reported
response to the following question: "Because of your high
blood pressure/hypertension, are you now taking prescribed
medicine?" Using the specific drug data also allowed us to
more completely examine drug utilization patterns and illus-
trate how the JNC VI recommendations for antihypertensive
therapy were being applied to US hypertensives. Addition-
ally, we presented unadjusted and stratified subgroup esti-
mates rather than age-adjusted ones to estimate the true
prevalence of antihypertensive medication use among US
hypertensives rather than simply examining relative differ-
ences in drug use across time periods.
The primary strength of this study is the use of the
NHANES data with its nationally representative samples and
oversampling of key demographic subgroups such as older
persons and ethnic subgroups. Additionally, blood pressure
was obtained by standardized examinations. Finally, prescrip-
tion data were collected by trained interviewers, with the use
of an in-person, household interview protocol, with verifica-
tion of drugs by inspection of medication containers.
However, several potential limitations of our study should
be noted. First, while the auscultatory method of blood
pressure measurement in NHANES is fully consistent with
JNC VI standards, NHANES measurements are performed
only at a single time point. By contrast, the clinical applica-
tion of the JNC VI classification of hypertension is based on
the average of 2 properly measured blood pressure readings
on 2 separate occasions. It is therefore possible that in our
study, some subjects were misclassified with regard to
hypertension status. This potential problem was minimized to
some extent by taking the average of 3 separate measure-
ments obtained under the same standardized conditions in
both surveys. Furthermore, NHANES is a cross-sectional
study, and participants were asked to recall only medications
used in the past month, thus identifying the set of hyperten-
sives currently on drug therapy. Those who used an antihy-
pertensive drug at any time before the 1-month recall period
are classified as a hypertensive but without current antihy-
pertensive medication use. The particular choice of a study
recall period will affect prevalence estimates. The NHANES
1-month recall period is reasonable, and a short recall period
increases the validity of the data collected by minimizing
recall bias. The data collected also do not allow us to
determine whether the drug reported was the first prescribed
and used or whether other drugs were prescribed and used
earlier. This limited our ability to address compliance with
JNC VI recommendations regarding drug classes for initial

treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. In addition,
NHANES did not include collection of drug dosage and
strength information, and therefore no such data were avail-
able for analysis.
We conclude that among US adults with hypertension,
antihypertensive medication use significantly increased over
the past decade. During 1999­2002, 60% of adults with
hypertension used an antihypertensive drug in the past month.
Although significant increases have occurred for certain
hypertensive groups, disparities by demographic factors con-
tinue to exist. Continued efforts are needed to improve
antihypertensive medication use, especially among younger
hypertensives and racial and ethnic minorities in certain
gender and age groups. By 1999­2002, antihypertensive
utilization patterns among those with diabetes, congestive
heart failure, and heart attack were consistent with JNC VI
recommendations. These NHANES data reflect the most
broadly representative trends in antihypertensive medication
use patterns estimated to date.
