Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate prenatal and
perinatal determinants of school age blood pressure (BP) in former preterm,
low birth weight infants.
Study Design: We studied 694 participants in the Infant Health and
Development Program, an eight-center longitudinal study of children
born p37 weeks and p2500 g. We obtained information about prenatal
and perinatal factors by interview and medical record review, and
measured BP three times at age 6.5 years.
Result: Adjusting for sex, age, sociodemographic variables and height
Z-score; for each Z-score birth weight for gestational ageFwhich
represents fetal growthFsystolic BP at 6.5 years was 0.7 mm Hg higher
(95% confidence interval À0.1, 1.6). Maternal age, pre-pregnancy weight,
gestational weight gain, smoking, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
and child gestational age and neonatal complications were also not
associated with BP.
Conclusion: In contrast to full-term infants, slower fetal growth was not
associated with higher BP in former preterm, low birth weight infants.

Introduction
Compared with infants born full term, former preterm infants have
higher blood pressure (BP) in adolescence and adulthood, with
studies reporting systolic BP 2.4 to 13 mm Hg higher in former
preterm infants compared with term-born controls.1­9 Identifying
the determinants of higher BP in this population may allow
clinicians to identify which former preterm children and adults
are at highest risk for developing hypertension and its sequelae
later in life, and would also help elucidate the underlying
mechanisms of fetal BP programming.
In animal models of fetal growth restriction, growth-restricted
offspring develop sustained BP elevation after birth,10 consistent
with the biological phenomenon of developmental programming.
In human populations born at or near term, investigators have
found associations of fetal growth restrictionFas represented by
lower birth weightFwith later BP elevation,11 and have identified
other prenatal determinants of higher BP, including
preeclampsia,12­16 other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy17
and maternal smoking.18 Little information exists regarding the
extent to which these and other prenatal and perinatal factors
influence later BP in preterm populations.
The objective of our study was to examine associations of
maternal and child prenatal and perinatal factors with systolic BP at
school age in a large sample of preterm, low birth weight infants.
Methods
Study design and participants
We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Infant Health
and Development Program (IHDP), an eight-center longitudinal
study of 1080 infants born at p37 completed weeks gestation
and p2500 g that began in 1984 as a randomized trial of a
post-discharge early child development intervention. Participants
were enrolled in IHDP at the time of their newborn hospitalization.
The methods of IHDP have been described elsewhere in detail.19
The trial's primary outcomes related to cognitive development,
behavior and health status have been reported through 18 years of
age.20­22 Institutional review boards for all participating centers
approved the study and caregivers provided written informed
consent.
Participants were eligible for this analysis if they were from
one of the seven IHDP study sites that conducted a clinical exam,
including BP at age 6.5 years. Of the 931 eligible participants,

809 (87%) completed any part of the age 6.5-year exam and of
these, 694 (86%) had any BP data recorded. The main reason for
missing BP data was that the study visit was completed at a
location other than the IHDP clinical site, such as by telephone
or in the mother's home. All 694 participants had data for at least
one predictor variable, so they were included in the final sample
for analysis.
Measurements
At the time of enrollment, study staff collected data regarding
maternal and child health from the medical record, including
birth weight, gestational age, birth order, maternal age and
pregnancy and neonatal complications. Pregnancy complications
including preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders were
recorded if they were noted in the medical record.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was defined as requiring
supplemental oxygen for >30 consecutive days or requiring
ventilator therapy with chest X-ray findings consistent with the
diagnosis. Mothers were interviewed regarding their weight
(pre-conception and at delivery), smoking and alcohol intake
during pregnancy and socio-demographic factors.
When children were 6.5 years old, study staff followed a
standardized protocol to measure resting BP three times in the right
arm by auscultation (n ¼ 164) or Dinamap automated oscillometric
device Critikon, Tampa, FL, USA (n ¼ 530). The correct cuff size was
chosen based on the measured mid-arm circumference. Staff also
recorded the participants' behavioral state at the time of BP
measurement as `fully cooperative' or `somewhat cooperative and
fussy', and did not attempt to measure BP if the participant or parent
refused (n ¼ 2).
Analysis
Our primary outcome was the mean systolic BP at age 6.5 years.
Although systolic BP predicts later outcomes better than diastolic
BP,23 we also examined mean diastolic BP as a secondary outcome.
Continuous predictors were maternal age, pre-pregnancy weight
and gestational weight gain, and child birth weight, gestational
age, birth order and fetal growth as represented by birth weight for
gestational age Z-score based on a national reference.24 Categorical
predictors were pregnancy and neonatal complications including
preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes
and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fetal growth status, with small
for gestational age (SGA) defined as birth weight for gestational
age <10th percentile, and smoking and alcohol intake in
pregnancy. We considered confounding by socio-demographic
variables including maternal race/ethnicity, attained education
level and annual household income, all assessed at the time of
study enrollment.
We used multivariable linear regression to examine associations
of predictor variables with the mean systolic and diastolic BP in
mm Hg at 6.5 years, adjusting all analyses for the exact age in days
at the time of BP measurement, measurement method
(auscultation versus automated) and the child's behavioral state
at the time of measurement. In examining the effect of gestational
weight gain on BP, we additionally adjusted for gestational age
at birth. We also adjusted estimates for socio-demographic
variables and for height Z-score at age 6.5 years, based on the
Centers for Disease Control growth reference,25 because height is an
important determinant of BP and may be affected by prenatal
and perinatal factors. As IHDP included children born at a wide
range of gestational ages, and to facilitate comparison with
other published studies,3,5,26 which included only very preterm
infants, we stratified our fetal growth analyses by gestational
age category (<32 weeks versus X32 weeks). We used SAS
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for all analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the 694 children included in this analysis and
their mothers are shown in Table 1. Median (range) birth weight
was 1.87 (0.54, 2.50) kg and median (range) gestational age
was 34 (25, 37) weeks. The median birth weight for gestational age
Z-score, which reflects fetal growth was À1.1, showing that on
average, fetal growth for this cohort was approximately 1 s.d. below
the median for a contemporary national reference population.24
Using the same reference population, 39% of this cohort was
SGA, defined as having a birth weight for gestational age percentile
<10. These characteristics were similar for the original IHDP
cohort of 1080 children (data not shown). In comparison to
the original IHDP cohort, mothers of children included in this
analysis were somewhat more likely to be black (59 versus 53%)
and less likely to have a college degree (28 versus 33%).
Table 2 shows associations of maternal and child variables with
systolic BP at 6.5 years. In model 1, estimates were adjusted for
child age, sex, BP measurement conditions and socio-demographic
variables. For each Z-score increment in birth weight for
gestational age, systolic BP at age 6.5 years was 1.0 mm Hg higher
(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2, 1.9). Additional adjustment
for height Z-score at 7 years (model 2) attenuated this estimate
(0.7 mm Hg, 95% CI À0.1, 0.2). Children born SGA had systolic
BP 0.7 mm Hg lower (95% CI À2.0, 0.6) than children born
appropriate for gestational age. The presence of maternal
hypertensive disorder was associated with higher systolic BP in the
child (3.5 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.0, 7.0), but additional adjustment
for maternal hypertensive disorder in the fetal growth models did
not change the effect estimates, nor did adjustment for body mass
index at 6.5 years (data not shown). None of the other maternal or
child predictor variables was substantially associated with child
systolic BP (Table 2), nor was any predictor variable associated
with diastolic BP (data not shown). In analyses stratified by BP
method (auscultation or automated device), no statistically
significant association of birth weight for gestational age Z-score

with child systolic BP was identified for either method
(for auscultation, 0.4 mm Hg per Z-score (95% CI À1.2, 1.9) and
for automated device, 0.1 mm Hg per Z-score (95% CI À0.9, 1.1)).
Results were also similar between methods for other predictor
variables.
Consistent with findings in the overall sample, in analyses
stratified by gestational age category (<32 weeks versus X32
weeks), greater fetal growth was associated with somewhat higher
systolic BP in both gestational age categories (Table 3), though
results were not statistically significant.
Discussion
In full-term populations, numerous authors have reported that
lower birth weight is associated with higher BP later in life,11 but

the majority of those studies did not consider separate effects of
gestational length and fetal growthFboth determinants of birth
weightFon later BP. Studies in full-term children suggest that
SGA status at birth is a risk factor for later hypertension.27 In
contrast, our study, which included only children born preterm
and low birth weight, found that fetal growth restriction was not
associated with higher BP. In fact, we found that poorer fetal
growth was associated with slightly lower systolic BP at school age,
although the result was not statistically significant after adjustment
for attained height.
A large study26 of Dutch infants born at <32 weeks gestation
and/or <1500 g (very low birth weight) also examined the
association of fetal growth with later BP. That population-based
study found no association of birth weight s.d. score, a measure of
fetal growth, with systolic BP at age 19 years; our point estimate of
1.0 mm Hg per Z-score falls within that study's 95% CI of À0.7 to
1.7. Studies led by Hack et al.3 in the United States and Doyle
et al.5 in Australia also failed to find an association of poorer fetal
growth with higher BP later in life. Our study extends the findings
of those studies, demonstrating that in heavier and more mature
preterm infants, as well as in VLBW infants, fetal growth restriction
does not appear to be a risk factor for later hypertension.
Additionally, in contrast to studies in full-term children,12­14 we
did not find that maternal preeclampsia was associated with higher
school age BP. We also did not find an association of maternal
smoking with offspring BP, in contrast to one study in a full-term
cohort,18 but consistent with the results of another.28 A possible
explanation for the discrepant findings between full-term and
preterm populations relates to the timing of prenatal exposures.
The developmental origins of health and disease paradigm rests
on the hypothesis that exposures during critical periods of
development, particularly fetal life and early infancy, can program
long-term health.29 It is possible that fetal growth restriction,
preeclampsia and/or maternal smoking late in the third trimester
influence BP, whereas the same exposures earlier in gestation, as
experienced by infants born preterm, do not.
Studies11,30 in children born full term have found that more
rapid weight gain in infancy is associated with higher BP later in
life. However, the extent to which more rapid early weight gain
leads to higher BP in preterm populations is unclear. In this
cohort, faster weight gain in the first year of life was associated
with only slightly higher (1.1 mm Hg per Z-score weight gain)
systolic BP at age 6.5 years, only for children born at X32 weeks
gestation.31 Weight gain later in childhood may also be an
important determinant of later BP in children born preterm.15
Our study is limited by the fact that children in IHDP were born
in the 1980's when clinical care of preterm, low birth weight
infants differed from current practices. Additionally, obesityFan
important determinant of BPFhas become substantially more
prevalent since that time. A majority of IHDP mothers were poor,
black and had attained low levels of education, possibly limiting
generalizability, although participants were enrolled at eight
centers across the country. Additionally, when compared with a
contemporary reference population,24 39% of our cohort was
considered SGA. Thus, despite overall poorer fetal growth in our
study population compared with a contemporary cohort, we still did
not find an association of fetal growth restriction with higher BP.
BP was measured by auscultation in some centers and
oscillometric device in others, but associations of fetal growth and
other predictor variables with BP were similar regardless of BP
measurement method.
In summary, we found that, in former preterm low birth weight
infants, slower fetal growth was not associated with higher BP later
in life. Fetal growth restriction does not appear to be a risk
factor for later hypertension in this population.
