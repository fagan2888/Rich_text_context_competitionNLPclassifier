Introduction
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is highly prevalent and
costly in terms of personal impacts, disability, work-loss
and healthcare expenditure (Hoy et al., 2010; Johannes
et al., 2010). In the United Kingdom (Department of Health
(DoH), 2001, 2005; Savigny et al., 2009) and internationally
(Airaksinen et al., 2006; Institute of Medicine of the National
Academics, 2011; Koes et al., 2010), there has been a move
towards encouraging self-management as a strategy for
reducing these impacts. The broad context to this strategy is
the transition to an older population characterised by long-
term health problems in a climate of rising healthcare costs
and limited state funding (Bury et al., 2005; Dagenais et al.,
2008; Freburger et al., 2009). This context has occasioned a
shift from a `medical model' towards the `empowerment' of
service users to control their own ways of living with illness
(DoH, 2006, 2011; Glasgow et al., 2008). It is frequently
observed among social scientists that the shift towards self-
management is part of a socio-political context in which the
balance of responsibility for health has shifted from the state
to the individual (Clarke and Bennett, 2013).
A number of generic (Kennedy et al., 2007) and disease-
specific (Lamb et al., 2010; Lorig, 2003; Van Hooff et al.,
2012) self-management programmes have been developed
to improve quality of life and independence for people with
long-term conditions, and there is a trend towards online
support and other digital resources. Healthcare providers
are encouraged to support patients towards pro-active cop-
ing strategies and independent self-care. However,
consistent patient engagement and achievement of effective

Abstract
A move towards self-management is central to health strategy around chronic low back pain, but its concept and meaning
for those involved are poorly understood. In the reported study, four distinct and shared viewpoints on self-management
were identified among people with pain and healthcare providers using Q methodology. Each construes self-management
in a distinctive manner and articulates a different vision of change. Identification of similarities and differences among
the viewpoints holds potential for enhancing communication between patients and healthcare providers and for better
understanding the complexities of self-management in practice.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
self-management remains a challenge (De Silva, 2011;
Rogers et al., 2008). Outcomes of interventions directed
towards self-management can be disappointing (Du et al.,
2011; Henschke et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2012; Williams
et al., 2012), and degrees of engagement and confidence in
self-management can vary considerably (Audulv, 2013;
Carnes et al., 2012; Hibbard et al., 2007; Zufferey and
Schulz, 2009).
Despite its strategic importance, there has been little
research into the concept and meaning of self-management
or how it is best achieved and supported in people with
CLBP. Various obstacles to self-management have been
identified, including patient and healthcare provider resist-
ance, poor access to information and services and lack of
knowledge among healthcare providers (Briggs et al., 2012;
Corbett et al., 2009; Lawn et al., 2009). However, a more
fundamental obstacle to effective implementation is the
existence of divergent viewpoints on the nature and mean-
ing of effective self-management on the part of different
stakeholders (Cooper et al., 2009; Crowe et al., 2010; Kawi,
2014; Miles et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2012; Ong et al.,
2014; Trappenburg et al., 2013). There is reason to expect
divergent viewpoints on self-management related to differ-
ent understandings and explanations of the nature, causes
and consequences of CLBP (McParland et al., 2011; Risdon
et al., 2003). In particular, if patients' viewpoints do not
correspond with those of healthcare providers (Busby et al.,
1997; Eccleston et al., 1997), then this can compromise
practices of self-management that expect people with pain
to apply professional advice to the particularities of their
own cases (Martin et al., 2014). Kenny (2004) writes in this
context of a `communication chasm', suggesting that medi-
cal explanations that invoke the psychological dimension
can prove controversial with patients (Corbett et al., 2009;
Peters et al., 1998; Toye and Barker, 2012). This study thus
systematically explores the range of viewpoints on self-
management held among stakeholders in CLBP care to
inform service developments and enable more effective
self-management for people with pain.
Method
Q methodology
Q methodology is a mixed-methods approach designed to
explore the subjective dimension of any issue towards
which different viewpoints can be expressed (Stenner and
Stainton Rogers, 2004). It has a long tradition of successful
applications in the field of health studies (Farrimond et al.,
2010; Stainton Rogers, 1991; Stenner et al., 2003), and has
been used to gain valuable insights in the study of chronic
pain (Campbell, 2009; McParland et al., 2011; Risdon
et al., 2003). Exploring viewpoints on self-management in
CLBP from the perspectives of both people with pain and
healthcare providers requires an appropriate methodology
designed to detect differences of viewpoint while affording
scope for their rigorous comparison. Q methodology per-
mits participants to express their own viewpoint in a struc-
tured way as a `Q sort' (Stenner et al., 2008). A Q sort is a
collection of items (usually a set of statements of opinion)
which are sorted by a participant according to a subjective
dimension such as `agreement/disagreement'.
Each Q sort provides the researcher with a model of
each participant's viewpoint (see Figure 1), and the result-
ing numerical data can be analysed quantitatively to find
patterns among the viewpoints.Aby-person correlation and
pattern analysis (typically factor analysis or principal com-
ponent analysis) of the collected Q sorts enables the statisti-
cal identification of any shared viewpoints among the
sample (Watts and Stenner, 2012). The result of a Q

analysis is a set of factors each of which identifies a cluster
of Q sorts which have been sorted in essentially the same
way. A qualitative exegesis of the quantitative results yields
an interpretation of the shared viewpoint which informs the
distinctive way of Q sorting captured by each factor.
Generating the Q set
The first phase of Q methodology is the development of the
items composing the Q set (the set of statements of opinion
to be given to participants for Q sorting). The Q set items
are statements which express the range of opinions, propo-
sitions and positions that are encountered in discussion
around self-management of CLBP. To generate these state-
ments, three sources were examined: (1) a review of rele-
vant literature, (2) a series of discussions held by the project
steering group (composed of researchers, clinicians and
service user representatives) and (3) the analysis of seven
focus groups run with people with varying levels of pain (as
determined by Von Korff et al.'s (1992) chronic pain grade)
and healthcare providers in the south east of England
(including representatives from physiotherapy, clinical
psychology, pain consultancy, general practice, orthopae-
dics, rheumatology, occupational health and practice man-
agement in primary, secondary and third sector care
services). From these sources, 372 initial statements were
generated and then divided into 10 themes, each containing
several emergent categories. From these, a Q set of 60
statements was selected for piloting through a process of
removing duplicates, synonyms and otherwise overlapping
propositions, and ­ where redundancy of items within cat-
egories existed ­ selecting the most representative items
while maintaining diversity and balance. The service user
representatives on our steering group played an active role
in selecting and refining the final item set. The pilot study
involved steering group members, professional contacts
and several participants from the focus groups. The final
item set is shown in Figure 2.
Participant recruitment
Ethical approval was gained from the National Health
Service (NHS) and host University Research Ethics
Committees. People with pain and healthcare providers
were recruited using emails and flyers targeted at relevant
local healthcare services and providers in the south east of
England. An invitation leaflet outlining the study and con-
tact details were given to people meeting the inclusion cri-
teria and considered to have an interest. Information sheets
were provided as well as a verbal explanation of the study.
Prior to obtaining written consent, participants were pro-
vided with information sheets, reassured that they could
withdraw at any time and that data would be anonymous.
A total of 120 completed Q sorts were returned: 60 from
patients with CLBP (age range from 23 to 81
years, of
which 37 were female) and 60 from healthcare providers
involved in managing individuals with CLBP (age range
from 26 to 75years, of which 39 were female, and several
healthcare providers also had personal experience with
CLBP).
Procedure
Participants received a Q sort pack by post or in person,
including (1) a biographical questionnaire collecting socio-
demographic data and information about CLBP care expe-
rience (to be completed first), (2) a complete set of
instructions, (3) the 60-item Q set on numbered laminated
cards, (4) a Q sort response grid sheet and (5) an open-
ended response booklet inviting written comments on rele-
vant items and sorting decisions. Each participant initially
grouped the items into `agree', `neutral/don't know' and
`disagree' piles. Participants then sorted these piles in a
more fine-grained agree/disagree continuum according to
the scale and matrix at the top of the response grid shown in
Figure 1.
Participants were encouraged to adjust their Q sort until
it felt representative of their viewpoint. Once completed,
the item numbers were recorded in the appropriate boxes of
the response grid shown as Figure 1. Participants were then
asked to provide open-ended comments to explain the
rationale of their sort, giving particular attention to items
that best defined their own position. The Q sort process
lasted approximately 60minutes.
Results
Analysis
The 120 completed Q sorts were entered into SPSS (Version
20.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) for statistical analysis
using principal component analysis and varimax rotation
with Kaiser normalisation. In a Q analysis, the loading of
each Q sort on each extracted factor is expressed as a cor-
relation with that factor. In a four-factor solution, all but
three of the 120 Q sorts loaded significantly (at the p=0.01
level) onto one of the four factors. This four-factor solution
was accepted because (1) each factor had at least two `fac-
tor exemplar'Q sorts loading significantly on it alone, (2) it
satisfied the Kaiser­Guttman criterion which states that all
extracted factors should have an eigenvalue greater than
unity (
>
1) (Brown, 1981; Guttman, 1954) and (3) each
factor offered a clear, distinct and theoretically meaningful
viewpoint on self-management (see below). For more
details on criteria for factor solutions in Q methodology,
(Watts and Stenner (2012).
In all, 74 Q sorts significantly loaded the first factor
(which had an eigenvalue of 29.82 explaining 24.86% of the
study variance), 21 `exemplars' loaded the second (with an
eigenvalue of 12.66 explaining 10.55% of the variance), 14
4 Health Psychology Open 
Figure 2. Factor array for factor 1.
Stenner et al. 5
loaded the third (eigenvalue 11.13/9.27% of study variance),
while the fourth factor had 8 significantly loading exemplars
(eigenvalue 7.51/6.26% of study variance). To simplify
interpretation, a single `factor exemplifying' Q sort (known
as a `factor array') was created for each factor using the fac-
tor scores for each item (Watts and Stenner XXX, 2012).
Each of the four factor arrays resembles a Q sort completed
by a participant, but is in fact a `best estimate' of the factor
derived from data from all the Q sorts conforming to its pat-
tern (Figure 2 shows the factor array for the first factor, oth-
ers are available on request from the first author (P.S.)).
Factor interpretations
Interpretations of the factors draw upon all the ranking
positions in the factor array and also on the open-ended
comments from exemplar participants collected post-Q
sort. In the interpretations below, these comments are indi-
cated, where relevant, in italics, with P indicating a person
with pain and HP a healthcare provider. Where the ranking
position of an item is important to a section of interpreta-
tion, the relevant item is noted in brackets; hence (14: +6)
would indicate that item 14 was ranked in the +6 position in
the relevant factor array. Since there were no obvious asso-
ciations between factor loadings and other data collected
(such as employment status, chronic pain grade, duration of
CLBP or disability status), these data will not be further
discussed. The summaries below are condensed versions of
full interpretations each of which was checked by a factor
exemplar participant (who confirmed that the summary
expresses a faithful version of their viewpoint).
Factor 1 summary: `I can change' ­ a personal
evolution
Atotal of 21 people with pain (12 females, age range 24­76)
and 53 healthcare providers (33 females, age range 26­75)
loaded onto the first factor. With 74 exemplars including
88
per cent of the service providers, this is very much the
normative viewpoint. The main feature of this viewpoint
was the idea that successful self-management of CLBP
involves a significant change of `mind-set' (14: +6). This
change is a personal evolution: attitude is key. You have to
get yourself out of the old mind-set (HP08); thinking affects
what we do: it's fundamental (HP14); the mainstay of treat-
ment ­ I see this as absolutely vital (HP25); a positive atti-
tude is crucial for motivation (P10); the only way to
successfully self-manage is to address negative thoughts
(P27); really important; power of the mind is great, so need
a positive attitude to have most positive results (P28).
A changed mind-set equips individuals to live an active
life with their pain (1: +5). Their way of thinking influences
what people with pain do and how they feel, and so to move
forward with self-management it is vital to adopt a positive,
accepting and mindful attitude. This typically means a
change of attitude, since many people find themselves
`stuck' in a mind-set which can make self-management dif-
ficult (16: +3): as self-management is about changing your
thinking, searching for a magic bullet is simply tethering
yourself to your old thinking (HP08). Pain, for example,
can easily lead to negative thinking (40: +3). This in turn
can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety which can actually
make the pain worse (21: +5). Likewise, dwelling on wor-
ries and fears can make managing the pain more difficult
(18: +4). Wishful thinking can also be a problem. For
example, people in pain often quite understandably hope
that a simple cure is waiting around the corner. They may
devote their energies to a search for a magic bullet which
may in fact never appear, and in this way, they can become
`stuck' in a waiting game, unable to go forward (44: +6):
one of the first steps towards successful self-management is
to accept there's no magic cure (HP07).
In cases where a physical cure is unlikely, it is important
to accept this and to learn to make the changes that are nec-
essary to cope with CLBP, and to live with it (45: -6): The
magic cure may not exist. `Looking at it'may be ok, but not
putting your life on hold until you found it (HP12). Managing
pain is therefore much more than a medical matter (51: -6).
It is about people understanding and managing their feelings
and reactions to a life lived with pain, including the ways in
which pain may influence relationships, the ability to work,
ways of moving, self-esteem and sense of identity (20: +3,
28: +3): the interference of stress and other aspects of men-
tal health (e.g. depression or anxiety) should not be under-
estimated! Practice of mindfulness meditation has the
potential to be extremely beneficial! (HP06); depression and
anxiety can exacerbate pain (HP10); stress can cause more
pain and sleeplessness which in turn causes muscle to
tighten (P18); stress can cause pain: mostly common in
back, neck and shoulder (P19); yes. Fear is a huge barrier.
With extensive education, reassurance, appropriate treat-
ment the patient is no longer fearful of their CLBP. They can
move forward (HP07).
Having the right mind-set will aid this process, and will
allow individuals to stay in control of their pain rather than
allowing the pain to control them: this to me is the key to
self-management. Achieving function and goals despite of
the pain (HP48); this is how I describe pain management
programmes to the patients I refer to the course (HP58); I
think this is vitally important. If you let pain get a grip over
you it is very difficult to overcome (HP55); pain can take on
its own identity which challenges your identity (HP08); you
have to believe you can manage it!! And refuse to let it run
your life (P03); it's important to take control and do what
you can do (P10); agree with this, about taking some con-
trol back in your life (P28); easier said than done but this is
fundamentally what it is about (P27). Healthcare providers,
for their part, can advise on tools and techniques which aid
this process, helping to tailor advice and treatment to indi-
vidual needs (6: +4). Good self-management is about
6 Health Psychology Open 
professionals helping patients to regain control of their
lives by changing their lives to cope better with their pain
(19: +4, 9: +4).
Factor 2 summary: `Some things can change' ­
practical action guided by accurate information
The Q sorts of 17 people with pain (10 females, age range
23­81) as well as 4 healthcare providers (3 females, age
range 46­65) defined the second viewpoint in that they
loaded significantly upon the second factor. Self-
management of CLBP was perceived to require a pragmatic
approach: know what works, what hinders, what hurts like
hell! (P07); simple but true (P15). By carefully observing
what works and what doesn't (23: +6), the patient's life can
be organised to maximise their capabilities and minimise
future flare-ups (12: +5). People with pain want to plan and
organise their lives in accordance with their pain tolerance
so that they can get on with their lives (17: +5, 15: +3).
Staying active enables them to `claw back their lives': Pain
can worsen due to stiffness caused by inactivity and too
much rest. We were designed to move and you have to keep
the spine supple through gentle movement (P48). In order to
successfully manage the pain, people need a good partner-
ship with healthcare providers and it is helpful to receive a
thorough physical examination and credible information
(48: +5, 51: +4). Having a thorough physical examination,
for instance, can be reassuring: you never know what would
be behind the symptom (P12) and medical imaging can add
confidence to diagnosis and so adds confidence to patient
[sic] (P08). Good information and professional advice is
vital because ill-informed self-management might be harm-
ful (58: +3, 39: -5). That way, the person with pain can go
away with confidence and put the healthcare providers'
advice into practice (4: +4). According to this problem-
based perspective, the core of CLBP self-management lies
in a well-informed understanding of the practicalities of
staying active (13: +6). This has little or nothing to do with
psychotherapy or social relationship management (29: -4,
28: -4, 40: -5). Psychology and relationships are a differ-
ent life issue from CLBP problems and their solutions: self-
management is not about self-esteem, [it] is about managing
the pain (P31 to item 40); this is not pain management, this
is relationship management. `In sickness and in health ...'
this just adds guilt (P48 to item 28).
Factor 3: `Not sure what to/can change' ­
managing the uncertainty and worried trust in
healthcare providers
The third viewpoint was defined by the Q sorts of 11 peo-
ple with pain (7 females, age range 27­81) and 3 female
healthcare providers (age range 27­63). The main focus
was on the uncertainty of how to manage the complex
characteristics of CLBP in the context of what is perceived
as the lack of clarity and understanding coming from ser-
vice providers (56: +6): often a total lack of understanding
(P41); too many different conditions that need too many
different treatments (P20). There is a heavy reliance on the
healthcare providers to take an advisory role (52: +3):
patients need support from health professionals (P20).
People with pain want clarity from healthcare providers
and they want to be able to trust the advice they get: I do
think that the professionals should be well prepared to give
clear answers and advice to their patients otherwise they
will not trust them which makes compliance with self-man-
agement difficult (P32). They value thorough examina-
tions (48: +5) and proper diagnoses (49: +4), since these
promise an end to anxious uncertainty: yes, it's fear of the
unknown that hampers how we cope (P41); some practi-
tioners don't give diagnosis so the patients don't know
what is wrong with them and they go back to pay more
(P25 to 49). This is not so simple, however, and there is a
perception that healthcare providers may not give clear
answers and that the current health system lacks the kind
of standardised framework that is needed to give people
with pain consistent and effective help (60: +6, 54: +5):
departments are too fragmented and isolated from each
other (P41); `joined up thinking'has to be beneficial ­ The
whole picture is then considered (P38).
The result, from this viewpoint, was a lack of trust in pro-
fessional advice and a sense of being misunderstood and of
being sent away ill-equipped to self-manage (50: +4): being
told to `go away and do this or that'can be difficult to fit into
your life (P20). They feel that managing pain is a complex
affair that cannot be achieved by the patient alone (2: -6):
health professionals should take an active role in self-man-
agement (HP26). They feel the need for regular contact with
healthcare providers, and are reassured when they feel really
cared for and empathised with (53: +4). They value a strong
(ongoing) relationship of trust between person with pain and
healthcare providers so that help can be accessed as and
when needed. The professionals' advice, however, needs to
be easily transferable to people's everyday lives (55: +5).
Overall, there is a clear concern with trust and mutual under-
standing, which are evidently seen to be somewhat lacking:
having faith and trusting health professionals is extremely
important (HP26). This trust is vital given that people with
pain often find their situation difficult to cope with, being `on
the edge' of extreme thoughts of crisis (40: +4) and forms of
depression provoked by the pain: pain causes depression
which can damage motivation (and the ability to deal) but
realising that helps recovery (P20).
Factor 4: `The others need to change' ­
questioning the politics and creating a mutual
understanding of having CLBP
The fourth viewpoint was defined by the Q sorts of people
with pain only (5 females, 3 males, age range 37­67). As
Stenner et al. 7
with the third viewpoint, there was a strong feeling that
pain management should not mean coping alone, and strong
agreement that healthcare providers should be available for
help, guidance and follow-up (52: +6, 53: +6): there is no
human being who does not rely on anyone. We are social
creatures, we cannot live in solitude (P60). Comments from
participants expressed a clear preoccupation with the vital
importance of knowing that health professionals are there to
follow up how I'm doing well or not (P33), and with the
sense that this need might be frustrated: it takes months to get
an appointment (P59), perhaps not possible at current cli-
mate of NHS (P60). A distinctive feature of this perspective
was a concern with how people with pain are portrayed and
treated in society (33: -4): at work sometimes I am fine and
wary that people think I'm lying (P58). Since pain is invisi-
ble, they find that others do not necessarily take it seriously
or believe them (29: +5): I regularly experienced a culture of
blame, disbelief and indifference from the medical profession
(P59). They want to challenge the damaging perception that
they are perhaps avoiding work or playing the system (34:
+2). They also feel the need for expert proof of the validity
of their pain. Medical imaging, for example, is valued partly
because it can serve to prove the real existence of the pain
(51: +5). The hope is that this validation might also lead to
healthcare treatment that might cure the pain. Searching for
this `magic bullet' is not considered a barrier to achieving a
good self-management (44: -4). This hope is a `double-
edged sword', however, since if no obvious physical causes
are found, this can contribute to the climate of suspicion:
unfortunately, visual evidence is the only way of fending off
the suspicion of `feigning'your pain (P59); It [a scan] helps,
if anything is shown but augments the doubt towards health
profession if nothing is shown (P60).
This viewpoint holds that people with pain are entitled to
healthcare services in the NHS which should be freely acces-
sible as and when needed (43: -5). In the context of cuts to
these services, it can sometimes feel as though `self-manage-
ment' is a way to save on costs (8: +3, 4: -5): ... `we can't
help anymore so here are some ideas to help you cope' (P24).
In this context, it becomes important to insist upon the rights
of people with pain to treatment and the responsibilities of
professionals to provide care (3: -6). It can be useful from
this perspective to form alliances with those in similar posi-
tions, sharing experiences with other people with pain to get
relevant information and knowledge (30: +4, 31: +4).
Those expressing this viewpoint first of all want their
CLBP to be acknowledged (48: +4). They feel that self-
management should not preclude the search for practical
and effective treatments which cure the problem: Call a
sniper [healthcare providers] and eliminate the terrorist
[pain] with a sure shot (P60). They are aware, however,
that this search is itself a way of coping with their situation
(45: +3, 51: +5): You need to keep on looking because if a
cure does come up you don't want to miss it (P24); I don't
think it is a barrier, it can also be a goal for someone.
Searching for latest `cure'can provide means of coping for
someone (P60).
Discussion
Four distinct viewpoints on self-management have been
identified from 120 completed Q sorts. Each viewpoint is
condensed into the pattern of a particular way of sorting the
60 statements (supported by open-ended comments), and
these patterns have been interpreted and reported in qualita-
tive detail. The first viewpoint is normative in the sense that
most of our participants sorted according to this first pat-
tern, including the vast majority (88%) of the service pro-
viders and 36per cent of the service users. Having access to
this `prototypical' summary should be of significant value
to future efforts to enhance self-management practice. The
other viewpoints should not be neglected, however, since
they are also coherent and feature aspects either peripheral
to, or rejected by, the first viewpoint.
Two cross-cutting themes
Having these `snapshots' of four distinct speaking posi-
tions provides a useful basis for exploring the evident
scope both for agreement and tensions among self-man-
agement stakeholders. It is therefore of value to use this
discussion section to bring out the key points of difference
and similarity between the four viewpoints. The identifica-
tion of points of difference which are sources of potential
misunderstanding and even conflict is particularly valua-
ble. Two themes can be identified which cut across the four
viewpoints. These serve to highlight the key points of dif-
ference and similarity between the viewpoints, thus point-
ing to sources of potential misunderstanding which might
interfere with self-management.
First theme: changing the self/resisting self-change.Consistent
with previous findings (Eccleston et al., 1997; Martin et al.,
2014), the relevance of what might be called the psychologi-
cal dimension proves to be a key point of difference. How-
ever, while it is clear that explanations that invoke
`psychology' can be controversial, it is important not to
assume a shared understanding of the meaning of `psychol-
ogy' since this notion appears to take on different signifi-
cance from different viewpoints. The first factor places great
importance on the need to change `mind-set'and `attitudes'.
This emphasis on mode of thought, however, ought not to be
taken as indicating a set of psychological processes which
exist in abstraction from the rest of the world. On the con-
trary, if `mind-set' is important to this viewpoint, this is
because it is tightly connected to action, to feeling and hence
to physical wellbeing: thinking affects what we do: it's fun-
damental (HP14). This explains the strong agreement with
item 14 when compared to its ranking from the other three
viewpoints, as indicated below:
8 Health Psychology Open 
The wording of this item is significant, since it does not
suggest that `changing how you think' is more important
than `changing what you do', but as important. The prag-
matic focus of factor 2, by contrast, is concerned with
changing what one does and not what one is. From this per-
spective, psychological themes of self-esteem or of manag-
ing negative feelings are actively rejected as issues not to
be confused with self-management:

Despite this clear difference, it is interesting that feel-
ings are welcomed as relevant by factor 2 in the much more
practically relevant setting of overcoming fear of flare-ups
which might hinder concrete activity:
A closely related dimension concerns the different
meanings given to the `physicality' associated with the
search for underlying bio-medical factors explanatory of
the pain. The different perspectives on this dimension are
starkly illustrated by the rankings of item 44:
In short, a key part of the factor 1 project of `self-
change' is changing the (understandable) desire for a sim-
ple cure and accepting the need for ongoing
self-management in the absence of a cure. Consistent with
their stance on `the psychological', factor 2 exemplars are
unwilling to take this step of self-change prior to the avail-
ability of clear medical evidence, indicating the lack of a
physical cause and possible cure: no. If I find the magic
cure then this too will help improve my circumstances
(HP01)); not in my experience. My silver bullets ­
Alexander Technique, massage, ... physiotherapy exer-
cises (P08); searching is fine till you get to #48 [thorough
examination] + #49 [given a diagnosis].
Second theme: independence/isolation versus dependence/right
to care. Factors 1 and 2 are broadly `in line' with an agenda
of self-management, with factor 2 taking a more narrowly
focussed pragmatic position on the practicalities of how to
do it (informed by expert knowledge). Both perspectives see
that change is needed, but for factor 1, that change involves
a more deep-seated change in mind-set rather than the
adjustment of conduct that is the central concern of factor 2.
Factors 3 and 4 are more complex in this respect. Factor 3
voices a profound uncertainty about how to proceed and
about what can be changed, along with a critical sense of
disappointment with the input of healthcare providers (who
they both need to trust and fail to trust). Factor 4 voices a
broader set of concerns. It is the societal perception and
treatment of individuals with CLBP by others which needs
to be changed, and this is sometimes associated with a cost-
cutting governmental agenda which violates healthcare
rights. The viewpoint of factor 3 is `irritated', as it were,
with a sense of misunderstanding, mistrust and even aban-
donment, while that of factor 4 is irritated by a sense of
injustice and unfairness.
Both of these perspectives (factors 3 and 4) strongly
resist the implication that self-management should mean
the withdrawal of professional healthcare. This means
that what might be seen positively as `independence' from
the perspectives of factors 1 and 2 shows up negatively as
`isolation' and even as the threat of `abandonment' for
factors 3 and 4. Symmetrically, what might be seen nega-
tively as `dependence on healthcare providers' from the
perspectives of factors 1 and 2 shows up as claiming a
`right to health-care' and being `properly treated' for fac-
tors 3 and 4. These critical attitudes make it likely that,
despite being relatively minoritarian (at least in the con-
text of the present study), the perspectives of factors 3 and
4 are likely to be loudly and resiliently voiced, and hence
to constitute a significant part of the debate and practice
around self-management. This theme of `independence/
isolation' is brought out starkly in the following compara-
tive rankings:

In this context, the wish for diagnoses, scans and physical
examinations is associated with the sense of a right to treat-
ment and the need to prove the reality of the pain to sceptics:
Despite the similarities noted above, factors 3 and 4 are
distinct in that factor 3 tends to be critical of healthcare
professionals, while factor 4 is more preoccupied with neg-
ative societal perceptions of people with pain.
These four factors (and two themes) provide a more
nuanced appreciation of what, in certain circumstances, can
become a `communication chasm' (Kenny, 2004) between
people with pain and healthcare providers. The findings
suggest that the social object of CLBP self-management is
understood in distinctive ways from these four perspectives,
and that key differences in meaning emerge around (1) the
significance of implicating the psychological dimension and
(2) of themes connoting independence and autonomy versus
isolation and abandonment. Clear communication is likely
to be challenged by the fact that each perspective assumes a
very different construction of these issues, and that ­ espe-
cially for factors 3 and 4 ­ these constructions carry differ-
ent ethical implications concerning the sense of justice,
rights and obligations. Such obstacles to communication are
likely to play a key role in the low uptake of psychologically
based rehabilitation programmes despite evidence for their
effectiveness. As Martin et al. (2014) suggest, if self-man-
agement is to be effective, there must be more consistent
investment in explaining pain, especially since the anxiety
created by unexplained symptoms can compound the symp-
toms. The present findings also suggest that the notion of a
`communication chasm' can be overstated (Salmon et al.,
2004), since the majority of our participants with pain
voiced views in line with current policy and in agreement
with the majority of our healthcare providers.
This study is limited, however, in that it can only pro-
vide a static `snapshot'of the range of viewpoints expressed
using this item set by a strategically sampled but self-
selected group of participants. Regarding the latter point, it
is possible that those most sceptical about CLBP self-
management opted out of participation, and this possibility
should be followed up in future work. We would thus not
claim that the debate on CLBP self-management is limited
to the four viewpoints explicated in this study. Regarding
the former point, future research should investigate whether
and how these `snapshots' relate to and play out in concrete
real-time (i.e. temporally unfolding) communicative prac-
tices. The authors have made a start on this by inviting fac-
tor exemplars to participate in a Knowledge Translation
Conference designed to facilitate the recognition of multi-
ple perspectives on the part of CLBP service providers and
service users. Although a formal analysis of this event
remains work-in-progress, it is clear that during real-time
communication (e.g. between a service provider identified
with factor 1 and a person with pain identified with factor
3), the viewpoints informing discursive contributions are
more fluid and variable. Nevertheless, points of difference
and tension emerged at the junctures suggested above that
were discernable only thanks to the `crystallisations' pro-
vided by the four factors. It is thus important to avoid reify-
ing the four viewpoints if the findings are to be of practical
value as a guide for understanding the realities of actual
communicative practice (including the practice of self-
management). Embedded in this appropriate theoretical
context (Stenner, 2015), the findings enhance our knowl-
edge of the viewpoints at play and provide a basis for
improving self-management and behaviour change, as well
as professional and patient training. The four factors, for
example, provide a focus for reflexive conversation and
practice, within and between service users and providers,
aimed at increasing the confidence of people with pain in
their ability to self-manage. They provide a basis for a more
nuanced and tailored approach to self-management that
recognises that different modes of engagement with it are
grounded in qualitatively distinct modes of understanding
(Hibbard et al., 2009). Enhanced self-management could
reduce the impact of persisting problems or recurrences
while lessening the burden on healthcare providers by
reducing the number of treatments needed.

Conclusion
The study provides valuable insight into the diversity of
stakeholder viewpoints on self-management. The first and
largest viewpoint might be taken as the normative proto-
type of self-management practice. The other viewpoints
(predominantly voiced by people with pain) articulate
either neglected concerns for future consideration, or points
of potential tension between different taken-for-granted
viewpoints. Tensions include the orientation towards the
psychological dimension, the significance of autonomy and
independence with respect to responsibility for self-man-
agement, the attitude towards possible cure and the role
and nature of healthcare provider input in a challenging
economic context. In drawing attention to these differ-
ences and tensions, the study provides an informed basis,
not just for the collaborative development of particular self-
management strategies but also for the articulation of an
explicit and consensually agreed conceptualisation of self-
management. The absence of such a conceptualisation is
likely to prove an obstacle to the effective coordination of
the activities of stakeholders in CLBP self-management.
