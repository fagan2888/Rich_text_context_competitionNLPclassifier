FEW families fit the notion of a "sandwich generation,"
where adults simultaneously provide care for young chil-
dren and elderly parents. More commonly, middle-aged adults
with elderly parents have children who are grown (Grundy &
Henretta, 2006; Spitze & Logan, 1990). Prior studies of inter-
generational support tend to examine only two generations at a
time, either middle-aged adults' exchanges with elderly par-
ents (e.g., Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2005; Laditka & Laditka,
2001; Suitor, Pillemer, & Sechrist, 2006) or their exchanges
with young adult offspring (e.g., Aquilino, 2006; Eggebeen,
1992). Studies rarely compare the support middle-aged adults
provide each generation and address the pivotal role that
middle-aged adults may experience within families. By exam-
ining only two generations, researchers have precluded an un-
derstanding of intergenerational support in the context of
multiple generations. Indeed, middle-aged adults may help
members of both generations (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000;
Grundy & Henretta; Soldo, 1996), but we know little about
how support provided to members of one generation is associ-
ated with support to members of the other generation.
This study examined middle-aged adults' exchanges with
each of their grown children and living parents. We assessed
the flow of generational support to grown children versus
parents.We were interested in why most families give greater
support on average to a grown child than to an aging parent
and asked whether affection and offspring's needs explain
this flow of support. In cases where middle-aged people pro-
vided more to their parents than to their children, we sought
to understand whether parental needs explained this pattern.
Generational flow of support in a life course
perspective
The literature suggests that in Western countries, inter-
generational support typically flows downstream. That is,
support flows from parents down to the younger generation,
rather than the reverse. According to a life course perspec-
tive, parents assist their children until very late in life, when
declines in health reverse the normal flow and parents turn
to their children for assistance (Fingerman & Birditt, 2009;
Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Studies in the United States docu-
ment financial gifts and loans (McGarry, 1999) and practical
support (Suitor et al., 2006) parents provide to grown
children. Similar findings are evident in Europe (Albertini,
Kohli, & Vogel, 2007; Kohli, 2005). Nonetheless, these
studies do not address three-generation families and the
decisions middle-aged adults make when they have grown
children and aging parents (for an exception, see Attias-
Donfut & Wolff, 2000). Furthermore, two additional issues
remain to be addressed.
First, we do not know whether middle-aged adults provide
support to each of their grown children or only to specific
children who have particular needs or affectionate relation-
ships with them. Prior studies have addressed total support

Objectives. Middle-aged adults engage in support exchanges with generations above and below. This study investi-
gated (a) how support to one generation is associated with support to the other and (b) factors accounting for whether
parents or offspring receive more support in a family.
Methods. Middle-aged adults aged 40­60 years (N = 633) completed telephone interviews regarding their relation-
ships and support exchanges with each grown child and living parent.
Results. Multilevel models revealed that most participants provided more support to the average grown child than to
the average parent. Yet, a proportion of the sample reversed this pattern, providing more support to parents. Mediation
models revealed that middle-aged adults provided greater support to offspring because they viewed offspring as more
important than parents and offspring had greater everyday needs (e.g., being a student, not married). Parental disability
accounted for greater support to parents.
Discussion. Discussion integrates solidarity theory, developmental stake, and contingency theory. Most middle-aged
adults provide more to grown offspring than to parents, consistent with their greater stake in their progeny. Middle-aged
adults also respond to crises (i.e., parental disability) and everyday needs (i.e., offspring student status) in providing
intergenerational support, in accordance with contingency theory.

middle-aged adults provide to grown offspring (e.g., Albertini
et al., 2007; Grundy & Henretta, 2006) or a randomly chosen
offspring (Aquilino, 2005). Some studies have provided in-
formation regarding support to multiple grown children
(e.g., Altonji, Fumio, & Kotlikoff, 1997; Suitor et al., 2006),
but these studies typically involve elderly parents and middle-
aged offspring, without considering the third generation.
Thus, the first purpose of this study was to ascertain whether
on average, each grown child within a given family receives
more support than each living parent.
Second, the downstream pattern of support may be nor-
mative but may not describe all families. If most families
give appreciably more support to offspring than to parents,
but a small proportion of families give more support to
parents, the average flow of support will be downstream.
Families that provide greater support to parents will not
be evident. Here, we examined variability in generational
discrepancies in multigeneration families.
Explanations for generational disparities
in support
We know little about explanations for typical patterns of
generational support. Why do middle-aged adults typically
provide more support to grown offspring than to their par-
ents in most families? In those families where parents re-
ceive more support than offspring, is parental disability the
only explanation? We examined these questions.
The literature regarding intergenerational exchanges is
rich in theoretical perspectives. Two of these perspectives in
particular may provide explanations for the discrepancies in
support to different generations. Solidarity theory suggests
that family members proffer help out of love and affection
(e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson,
1995). This theory pertains to groups and explains why one
set of family members engages in rich exchanges of sup-
port, whereas another family manifests few transfers among
members. Scholars also have applied intergenerational soli-
darity theory to intergenerational ties, testing whether indi-
viduals provide more support to family members for whom
they feel greater affection (e.g., Rossi & Rossi; Silverstein,
Gans, & Yang, 2006; Silverstein et al., 1995). The develop-
mental stake hypothesis, derived from intergenerational
solidarity theory, extends this argument. According to this
hypothesis, parents have a stake in grown children as their
future. Parents are emotionally invested in offspring and
feel more positive regard for offspring than offspring feel
for parents (Fingerman, 2001; Giarrusso, Stallings, &
Bengtson, 1995; Shapiro, 2004). Middle-aged adults may
provide more support to grown children than to aging parents
due to their emotional bonds and stake in their progeny.
The second theoretical perspective that may help explain
patterns of generational support concerns the needs of each
generation. Contingency theory in sociology (Eggebeen &
Davey, 1998) and altruism theory in economics (Schoeni,
1997) posit that family members receive more help when
they have greater needs (Eggebeen, 1992; McGarry &
Schoeni, 1997; Silverstein et al., 2006). This perspective
may explain why middle-aged adults may offer more help
to members of one generation on average than to those of
another generation, even in the absence of greater affection
for specific family members.
Contingency theory applies to the typical downstream
flow of support to grown offspring to meet their everyday
needs. In the United States, prolonged education, career ex-
ploration, and transient romantic ties foster increased
dependency on parents among well-off young adults,
whereas underemployment, single parenthood, and uncertain
work schedules elicit support from parents for less well-off
young adults (Aquilino, 2006; Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, &
Zarit, 2009; Furstenberg, 2000). Support decisions often re-
flect everyday needs arising from statuses offspring occupy.
For example, parents provide greater assistance to offspring
who are students than nonstudents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff,
2000; Fingerman et al., 2009). Unmarried offspring receive
more support than married offspring (Fingerman, 2000;
Rossi & Rossi, 1990). Middle-aged adults also assist grown
children with labor-intensive demands of young children
(Casper & Bianchi, 2002). With regard to generational pat-
terns, clearly, offspring are more likely to be students or to
have young children than are elderly parents. Furthermore,
although many elderly women are widowed, young adults
still are more likely to be unmarried than older adults (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2007).
Contingency theory also explains the life course reversal
in support patterns that favor older parents when they
are incapable of accomplishing daily tasks on their own
(Eggebeen & Davey, 1998). The downstream flow of sup-
port may reverse when parents incur health declines and dis-
ability (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Family members provide
care for older adults who face prolonged health declines at
the end of life. Middle-aged children are the most common
caregivers, followed by spouses (Wolff & Kasper, 2006).
Disability rates have decreased over the past three decades
(Schoeni, Freedman, & Martin, 2008), however, and less
than one fifth of families are involved in parental caregiving
at any time in the United States (Grundy & Henretta, 2006).
In families where a parent has incurred disabilities, how-
ever, we expected support to flow upstream to parents.
When middle-aged adults assist frail aging parents, they
also may extend less help to each grown child. One study to
examine this issue found that women who provided care for
aging parents also did provide support to grown children
(Grundy & Henretta, 2006). That study employed a dichot-
omous variable (whether any help is provided). Here, we
asked how much help is provided to each offspring when
parents require care. Based on contingency theory, we
expected the average amount of help to a grown child to
be less than the average amount of help to a parent when a
parent suffers disabilities.
SUPPORT TO PARENTS AND GROWN OFFSPRING 89
Contingency theory is less informative, however, with re-
gard to the potpourri of other problems individuals experi-
ence. Prior research reveals that parents provide more
support to offspring suffering crises (e.g., victim of a crime,
drug addiction; Fingerman et al., 2009; Pillemer & Suitor,
2006; Suitor, Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007a). If offspring suf-
fer more problems than parents, we would expect the pat-
tern of support to flow downstream.Yet, when parents suffer
troubles, we would expect to see a generational flow of sup-
port that favors parents.
Other factors associated with
intergenerational support
We also controlled for other factors associated with inter-
generational support. We considered gender of participant and
family member because mothers and daughters typically
exchange more help than fathers or sons (Rossi & Rossi,
1990). We included participants' marital status because mar-
ried adults are more likely to support other generations than
those who are divorced, remarried, or single (Aquilino, 2005;
Shapiro, 2003). Participants' income, education, and health
also were assessed because adults of higher socioeconomic
status (SES) and in better health provide more family sup-
port (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000; Henretta, Grundy, & Har-
ris, 2002).
Given that proximity constrains provision of certain types of
help, we included geographic distance between parties (Suitor,
Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007b). People may provide support
based on support they receive (e.g., Henretta, Hill, Li, Soldo,
& Wolf, 1997). Thus, we controlled for amount of support
each parent or offspring provides to the middle-aged adult.
Finally, we controlled for family size. Resource depletion
theory suggests that children in larger sibships receive fewer
resources from the parent (Blake, 1981; Davey et al., 2005;
Grundy & Henretta, 2006). Two parents are not necessarily
in competition for resources, but nonetheless, we controlled
for number of parents.
In sum, we examined middle-aged adults' support to each
parent and each grown child. Hypotheses were as follows:
Hypothesis 1: We expected most families to manifest a
downstream flow of support and to report more help to
the average grown child than to the average parent.
Hypothesis 2: In the majority of families where middle-
aged adults provide more support to the average offspring
than to the average parent, we expected affectional soli-
darity (i.e., greater affection and importance of offspring)
to explain the generational flow of support. We also tested
contingency theory and expected everyday needs arising
from normative statuses offspring occupy (student, un-
married, and parent of young children) to mediate sup-
port favoring offspring.
Hypothesis 3: In families where middle-aged adults provide
more to the average parent than to the average offspring, we
expected parental disabilities or crises to explain the pattern.
Methods
Sample
The sample included adults aged 40­60 (M = 50.60, SD =
4.99 years) who resided in the Philadelphia Primary Met
ropolitan Statistical Area (including urban, suburban, and
rural areas [Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001]) from
"The Family Exchanges Study" (N = 633; 302 men and
331 women). Each participant had at least one child over
the age of 18 and at least one living parent. Recruitment
occurred via telephone lists purchased from Genesys Cor-
poration and random digit dialing in regional area codes.
We oversampled neighborhoods with high density of ethnic
minorities. As a result, 31% of the sample was identified
as African American, 6% as multiracial, and 1% as White
Hispanic. Data were collected from January through August
2008.
Procedures
Participants reported on relationships with their grown
offspring and parents. Computer-assisted telephone inter-
view software permitted random order of administration of
sections of the survey pertaining to parents and to offspring.
Interviews lasted approximately 1 hr.
Participants provided the name, age, and gender of each
living child and each living parent. For each child over the
age of 18 (n = 1,384) and each parent (n = 868), partici-
pants then provided information regarding support, prob-
lems in the past 2 years, marital status, distance in miles,
and so forth. To avoid fatigue, we obtained detailed infor-
mation regarding relationship quality for each parent and
a maximum of three grown children. We selected the child
who received most, the child who received least, and a
random other child in families that had more than three
children. Because most participants (n = 555, 88%) had
three or fewer children, we had complete data on most
offspring (n = 1,251). We also considered the distribution
of parents and offspring within families; 64% of families
had more children over the age of 18 than parents, 32%
had the same number of grown children and parents, and
14% had one more parent than grown child (i.e., these par-
ticipants had two parents and only one child over the age
of 18).
Table 1 presents background information regarding par-
ticipants and participants' reports of their parents and grown
children. Sixty-three percent of participants had one living
parent, whereas the remaining had two living parents. On
average, participants had two children over the age of 18
(M = 2.19, SD = 1.24). Furthermore, 40.4% of participants
had children younger than age 18 in the home.
Dependent Measure: Support Exchanges
We developed the Intergenerational Support Scale to assess
support to each parent and each grown child: emotionally,
FINGERMAN ET AL.

practically, and in terms of, socializing, advice, finances,
and talking about daily events. Five items were from other
measures of social support (Vaux, 1988; Vaux & Harrison,
1985), and the remaining item (listening to talk about daily
events) was drawn from our prior work (Fingerman, 2000).
Participants rated frequency of each type of support for each
family member. In analyses, we reverse coded, so higher
numbers indicate more frequent support: 1 (less than once a
year or not at all), 2 (once a year), 3 (a few times a year), 4
(monthly), 5 (a few times a month), 6 (weekly), 7 (a few
times a week), and 8 (daily). Consistent with prior studies,
we combined the six items for each child and each parent,
a = .87 (Fingerman et al., 2009; Silverstein et al., 2006;
Vaux; Vaux & Harrison). We present the mean of the six
items (which is mathematically equivalent to the sum) for
ease in interpretation. The average score for provision of
support to offspring was M = 4.67 (SD = 1.68), and that to
parents was M = 4.15 (SD = 1.59).
We examined properties of the scale separately for sup-
port to parents and offspring. The coefficient alphas were
the same (a = .87 for parents and a = .88 for offspring).
Rank order of different types of support for parents and off-
spring was consistent. Listening to talk about daily life and
emotional support occurred most frequently, and practical
support and financial support occurred least frequently,
respectively.
Explanatory Variables
Functional disability.--We assessed functional disability
as potential moderator of the flow of support. We asked
whether each parent was able to accomplish five tasks
of daily living based on the Community Disability Scale
(Bassett & Folstein, 1991). Among middle-aged adults'
relatives, 43% of mothers and 26% of fathers had at least
one functional disability, but only 3% of grown children had
a disability.
Crises and problems.--We developed the Life Problems
Scale based on a similar list from a national study (Greenfield
& Marks, 2006). Participants indicated whether any of their
children or parents had experienced each of 10 problems in
the past 2 years (e.g., victim of a crime, alcohol or drug
problem, financial issues). When a participant indicated any
child incurred that problem, we asked which child(ren) had
experienced that problem. Likewise, when a participant
indicated a parent had incurred a problem, we asked which
one. We coded the occurrence of each problem for each
family member dichotomously (0 = did not experience
problem and 1 = did experience problem). As in other stud-
ies, we then used a sum of problems for each family mem-
ber (Fingerman et al., 2009; Greenfield & Marks).
Everyday needs.--We considered parents' or offspring's
statuses that might evoke everyday help, including student
status (1 = student and 0 = other), unemployment or retire-
ment status (1= retired or not working and 0 = working),
marital status (1 = married and 0 = not married or wid-
owed), and presence of young children (1 = has children
and 0 = does not have children).
Affection and importance of tie.--To assess affectional
solidarity, we used a concise and widely used two-item
measure of relationship quality (Birditt, Fingerman, & Zarit,
2010; Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,
2008; Umberson, 1989, 1992). Participants indicated (a)
how much each party (i.e., their father/mother/child) loves
and cares for them and (b) how much the other party under-
stands them from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal).
Participants also rated the importance of each parent or
child compared with other social partners: 1 (most impor-
tant person in your life), 2 (among the 3 most important), 3
(among the 6 most important), 4 (among the 10 most impor-
tant), 5 (among the 20 most important), and 6 (less impor-
tant than that). We reverse coded this item, so higher
numbers indicated greater importance of relationship
(Fingerman, 2000, 2001; Fingerman et al., 2008).
Potential Control Variables
Participant characteristics.--Participants provided their
age and gender during telephone screening. In the inter-
views, participants reported education in years and marital
status. They indicated their income in 2007 as 1 (<$10,000),
2 ($10,001­$25,000), 3 ($25,001­$40,000), 4 ($40,001­
75,000), 5 ($75,001­$100,000), or 6 (>$100,000) and rated
their health 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Participant average

SUPPORT TO PARENTS AND GROWN OFFSPRING 91
income was similar to mean income in the Philadelphia area,
M = 4.40, SD = 1.45. As can be seen in Table 1, participants
were well educated and rated their health from good to very
good. We also considered participants' marital status as a
potential control variable, 1 (first marriage) to 0 (other).
Parent and offspring characteristics.--Participants re-
ported age and gender of their grown children (664 daugh-
ters and 720 sons) and living parents (543 mothers and 325
fathers). Adult offspring ranged in age from 18 to 46 years
(M = 25.19, SD = 5.80), but most offspring (90%) were
aged 18­33 years. Parents ranged in age from 60 to 96 years
(M = 77.09, SD = 6.75). Parent and offspring ages were cor-
related with participant age (r = .63 for parents and r = .53
for offspring). Therefore, we included only participant's
age in analyses.
As in prior studies (e.g., Suitor et al., 2007a), we con-
trolled for distance between the middle-aged participant's
household and those of parents and offspring. To address
positive skew, we used a log-linear transformation of dis-
tance in miles in the analyses.
Reciprocal exchanges.--Participants also indicated how
often they received each type of support from each family
member. Again, we used the average of the six items,
a = .82. Scores for support that participants reported receiv-
ing were M = 3.49 (SD = 1.49) from offspring and M = 3.43
(SD = 1.42) from parents.
Analytic Strategy
Our analytic plan first focused on describing the overall
flow of support for the sample. Then, we looked at possible
mediators of downstream (greater support of offspring) and
upstream (greater support of parents) within families.
Each participant reported on multiple family members,
and the number of parents and offspring varied between
participants. We estimated multilevel models to account for
dependence in reports on multiple family members and
variability in number of family members by participant. We
used the default identity link function in SAS PROC Mixed
and a compound symmetry covariance structure. Amount of
support was the dependent variable, with generation (0 =
grown child and 1 = parent) as an independent variable.
Prior to analyses, we estimated bivariate associations be-
tween potential control variables and support because inclu-
sion of control variables not associated with a dependent
variable may generate spurious associations (Rovine, von
Eye, & Wood, 1988). Based on significant correlations, we
controlled the following for participant: age, gender, marital
status (1 = first marriage and 0 = other), income, number of
grown children, and number of parents but did not include
participant race, work status, health, education, or children
younger than age 18. Control variables pertaining to the
parent or child included their gender, distance (transformed),
and support they provided to the participant. An example
simplified equation is as follows:
Support to family memberij
= a0 + a1 (generationij
) + control
variables + ei
+ dij
Level i represents upper level participant variables and
level j parents and offspring nested within participant. Sup-
port to family memberij
is the amount of support from a
participant to a family member (offspringj
or parentj
), a0 is
the intercept (the amount of support when all predictors are
0), a1 (generationij
) is the association between generation
and support (it is the slope), ei is the error term between
participants, and dij
is the error term associated with each
family member within participants.
We also considered possible explanations for the genera-
tional flow of support in different families. We expected dif-
ferent models to explain a downstream flow of support to
offspring versus the upstream flow of support to parents,
with opposite generational differences on the explanatory
variables. For families that give more support to offspring,
we anticipated greater needs among offspring. For families
that give more to parents, we expected greater needs among
the parents. For ease in presentation, we examined partici-
pants engaging in downstream support (i.e., greater support
to the average offspring) and engaging in upstream support
(i.e., greater support to the average parent) separately.
We followed the standard three steps for mediation (e.g.,
Frazier, Tix, & Barron, 2004; Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger,
1998). First, we divided the sample into families with
greater support of average offspring (downstream families)
and greater support of average parent (upstream families).
These families each had a discrepancy on the independent
variable, in different directions (i.e., more support to aver-
age children vs more support to parent). Next, for each fam-
ily, we established that the independent variable (generation)
and the dependent variable (frequency of support) were as-
sociated. Then, we tested associations between the indepen-
dent variable (generation) and mediating variables (e.g.,
affective solidarity, normative statuses, needs) in each type
of family. In the final step, we evaluated the association of
the independent and dependent variables, adjusting for ef-
fects of mediators. Partial mediation is evident when the as-
sociation is weaker between independent and dependent
variables in the presence of the mediating variable. Sobel
tests assessed significance of the mediation effect (McKinnon,
Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995). Pseudo R2 statistics were also com-
puted to show the proportion of variance accounted for in
each model (Singer & Willett, 2003).
Results
We first present findings regarding support to parents and
offspring across the full sample. Then, we present media-
tion models explaining generational discrepancies in the
FINGERMAN ET AL.

different families (more support to children and more sup-
port to parents).
Patterns in the Generational Flow of Support
We expected a dominant pattern of middle-aged adults
generally reporting greater assistance to the average grown
child than to the average parent. This expectation was con-
firmed in the multilevel model comparing the amount of
help provided to parents and offspring in Table 2. The mul-
tilevel model included generation as a predictor, the support
index as the outcome, and appropriate participant level and
parent/offspring level characteristics as control variables.
As expected, most families gave more support to the aver-
age child than to the average parent.
To distinguish different types of families, we then exam-
ined the proportion of middle-aged adults who engage in
each pattern of generational support. We estimated discrep-
ancy scores in support to the average parent and average
offspring in each family. The distribution of support was (a)
families with downstream support favoring offspring by at
least half a point (53% of participants), (b) families with
upstream support favoring parents by at least half a point
(28% of participants), and (c) families with average parent
and offspring support scores within a half point of zero (21%
of families). Thus, despite the overall finding that offspring
receive more than parents, a sizable minority of families
provided more support to the average parent than the aver-
age offspring, and a proportion of families provide compa-
rable support to members of each generation on average.
In families that provide more support to offspring, the
average support to a grown child was M = 5.48 (SD = 1.15,
a few times a month to weekly) and to an aging parent M =
3.42 (SD = 1.20, a few times a year to monthly). In families
that provided more to parents, means were similar but in
the reverse pattern, average support to a grown child was
M = 3.66 (SD = 1.20) and to an aging parent M = 5.59
(SD = 1.23).
Explanations for Greater Support to Offspring or to
Parents
We then asked the following: (a) In families where
middle-aged adults provide more support to offspring,
why do offspring receive more support? (b) In families
where middle-aged adults provide more support to par-
ents, why do parents receive more support? We examined
mediation models for the participants providing greater
support to offspring and the participants providing greater
support to parents. We did not consider such models for
participants providing comparable support to each gener-
ation because there was no significant generational dis-
parity to explain.
Families in which offspring received more support.--
For families in which middle-aged adults provided more
support to offspring, we asked whether three factors medi-
ated the downstream flow of support: (a) everyday needs
(e.g., student status, marital status, presence of young chil-
dren), (b) crises in the past 2 years, and (c) affective soli-
darity or the generational stake (i.e., relationship quality
and importance of other party). Because families were se-
lected who gave more to offspring, Step 1 is provided sim-
ply for interpretation of mediation effects in Step 3. Table 3
shows the multilevel model for the first step, indicating
that offspring received significantly more support than
parents. The second step of generational disparities is not
shown in the table 3. This step was significant for five pos-
sible mediators; offspring were more likely to be students,
be unmarried, have young children, have higher quality
relationships, and have ties deemed more important by
middle-aged adults than ties to parents. Grown children
were not more likely to suffer problems (e.g., financial
problems, alcoholism) than were aging parents in these
families.
We estimated the third step of the meditational models
for each of the five potential explanatory variables sepa-
rately. Sobel tests revealed that three variables (being a
student, unmarried, and rated as more important) partially
mediated the generational disparity of greater support to
offspring: Sobel tests were -6.89, -5.39, and -5.11, p <
.001, respectively. Positive relationship quality and having
young children did not mediate the association between
generation and support in these families' relationship.

in comparison with the Step 1 model. In sum, explanatory
variables in these equations accounted for only a small
proportion of the variance in support in comparison with
the initial model.
Families in which parents received more support.--
Among families in which middle-aged adults provided
more support to parents than to offspring, possible me-
diators for this generational disparity included (a) every-
day needs (widowhood or being unmarried and retirement
or not working), (b) functional disability and crises, and
(c) affectional solidarity (relationship quality and impor-
tance of tie). As can be seen in Table 4, the Step 1 model
confirmed greater support to parents than to offspring.
Step 2 is not shown. This step was significant for five
possible mediators; parents in these families were more
likely than offspring to be retired or not working, have
more functional disabilities, have a great number of cri-
ses, have higher quality relationships, and be deemed
more important than offspring. Parents were not more
likely to be unmarried than grown offspring in these
families.
For Step 3, two variables partially mediated the associa-
tion between generation and support, functional disability,
and number of problems. Sobel tests were 4.79 and 3.36,
p < .001, respectively. As can be seen in Table 4, the slope
for generation was .59 at Step 1 and .34 for parental dis-
ability and .47 for parental crises or problems. Table 4
shows pseudo R2 for these mediation models in comparison
with the initial model.
Post Hoc Tests
Stability of findings.--To ensure stability of findings in
the flow of support, we reestimated models separately for
different sociodemographic groups. The pattern of findings
regarding overall flow of support did not differ for men
or women or for Black families and White families. Low-
income participants (<$40,000 per year) reported comparable
support of the average parent or offspring; but at all other

income levels, average offspring received more than aver-
age parent.
Discrepancies in support within families.--Finally, to
ensure that findings regarding explanatory variables were
stable, we estimated models for the entire sample, examin-
ing disparities in support within families. For each parent
and offspring, we generated a discrepancy score in com-
parison with other family members. First, we estimated a
mean support score, representing the average support to all
members in each family. Then, we subtracted that within-
family mean support score from each parent or offspring's
support score. A positive discrepancy score indicates that
an individual receives more support than the average for his
or her family. We used each family member's discrepancy
score as an outcome variable and entered generation, the
explanatory variables, and control variables in a multilevel
model. Table 5 shows findings that confirm prior models
for generation and the explanatory variables. Offspring
were more likely than parents to receive above average sup-
port within a given family. An individual in the family (par-
ent or offspring) received more support than average when
he or she was a student, unmarried, had a disability, suf-
fered more problems, or was viewed as more important
and had a better quality relationship with the middle-aged
adult.
Discussion
This unique examination of support provided to multiple
generations within families revealed that middle-aged adults
typically provided more support to grown children than to
aging parents but not in all families. In situations where
parents suffered disability or incurred other crises, middle-
aged adults provided parents with more help than they
provided to offspring. The typical pattern of helping behavior

SUPPORT TO PARENTS AND GROWN OFFSPRING 95
to offspring seemed to reflect offspring's needs and the im-
portance of the relationship. Middle-aged adults re-
sponded to their grown chidren's everyday needs,
emergencies, and crises, as well as the importance of the re-
lationship. Findings from this study support the affective
solidarity and contingency theories of support exchange,
suggesting that middle-aged adults provide help due to their
emotional investments and family member needs and crises.
Variability in the Flow of Support to Offspring and Parents
Because previous studies have focused primarily on two
generations (e.g., Eggebeen, 1992; Suitor et al., 2007a),
prior research has not addressed how support to any given
parent or offspring fits into a larger family context. In this
study, we examined support to both generations.
Consistent with life course perspectives regarding linked
lives (e.g., Greenfield & Marks, 2006), events in one
generation influenced experiences of another generation.
In general, middle-aged adults provided more support to
grown children than to parents. Even in families where
parents suffered functional disabilities, parents received
only slightly more help than offspring did from the mid-
dle-aged adults; the average offspring still received con-
siderable support. These findings support a premise of
"resource expansion" (Grundy & Henretta, 2006). Middle-
aged adults may attempt to expand resources offered to
family members when multiple family members experi-
ence needs, particularly when young adult offspring are in
need of support.
The caregiving literature documents costs that middle-
aged adults incur in providing care to elderly parents (e.g.,
Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995).
These burdens may also reflect displacement of support that
otherwise might have gone to grown offspring. In this study,
we do not know whether middle-aged adults reach a point
when they will reallocate resources away from offspring or
if strain on resources contributes to an eventual decision to
move a parent to a supervised care setting. Future research
should examine this issue.
Explanations for Generational Disparities
This study also sheds light on possible explanations for
within-family generational disparities in provision of sup-
port. Overall, some theories apply across ties and other
theories explain behaviors in specific ties. Contingency the-
ory helps explain decisions that middle-aged adults make
regarding allocation of resources to offspring and parents.
At the same time, solidarity theory plays a specific role;
middle-aged adults provided support to partners they
deemed more important in their social networks. Consistent
with the developmental stake, the majority of middle-aged
adults in this study provided more support to offspring than
to parents because they viewed their offspring as more im-
portant than their parents.
We also note structural variables associated with support.
Consistent with prior research, offspring in larger families
received less support on average than offspring in smaller
families (Davey et al., 2005; Fingerman et al., 2009). Like-
wise, number of living parents was associated with average
support to parent in these studies. These findings are consis-
tent with a premise that support resources are finite and are
distributed within families. Most families give more to the
average offspring than to a parent, but when a parent incurs
a crisis, the average support to a grown child is less. Like-
wise, when a greater number of family members require sup-
port, average support to any given family member is less.
Downstream flow of support to offspring.--In the major-
ity of families where support flowed downstream to off-
spring, middle-aged adults responded to normative needs
associated with role statuses in young adulthood, such as
being a student. The period of young adulthood involves
prolonged transitions, and parents support progeny as they
gain a foothold in adulthood (Aquilino, 2005; Furstenberg,
2000). The lack of association between having children of
one's own and support was surprising and may reflect the
fact that most offspring who had young children were mar-
ried. Elsewhere, researchers have found that unmarried off-
spring receive many forms of support (e.g., advice, money,
practical) from their parents (McGarry & Schoeni, 1997),
as was the case in this study.
Greater support to the average offspring also was consis-
tent with the developmental stake hypothesis. In the major-
ity of families that provide greater support to offspring,
middle-aged adults deemed ties to progeny more important
than ties to parents. This greater importance partially medi-
ated generational disparities in support. Support of grown
offspring also may reflect a pattern of support of children
that begins in childhood. Even after children reach adult-
hood, middle-aged parents derive rewards from continuing
to serve as their parents (Levitzki, 2009).
Interestingly, offspring did not incur a greater number of
crises than parents in these families. Prior studies have
found that parents differentiate among their offspring by
providing greater support to a sibling who incurs a crisis
(Fingerman et al., 2009; Suitor et al., 2007a), but offspring's
crises did not explain the generational favoritism observed
here. Rather, more pedestrian needs and affection appeared
to be at the heart of offspring support.
Upstream support of parents.--Upstream support of par-
ents was evident when parental functional deficits necessi-
tated hands-on care or when parents incurred crises or
problems (e.g., financial problems, crime). Data from other
studies also document increasing support to parents as they
accrue health problems during the transition to old age
(Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Fingerman, Hay, Kamp Dush,
Cichy, & Hosterman, 2007; Silverstein, Conroy, Wang,
Giarrusso, & Bengtson, 2002). Thus, middle-aged adults
FINGERMAN ET AL.
96
may respond to two types of needs: everyday needs and
emergency or crisis needs. The pattern of downstream sup-
port to offspring in the majority of families was mediated by
everyday needs associated with normative statuses. When a
crisis occurs, middle-aged adults provide greater support to
parents with urgent needs.
Statuses associated with everyday needs are not as evi-
dent in late life as are events that precipitate crises. Widow-
hood was not associated with greater support to parents than
to offspring, although widowed parents receive more filial
support than married parents (Ha, 2008; Morgan, 1989).
Nor did retirement explain support of parents. Data were
collected immediately prior to the economic downturn in
2008. Thus, at the time of data collection, most retired par-
ents had accumulated savings or social security, which may
not be the case today.
Limitations and Future Directions
We note several limitations in this study. The study as-
sessed a composite of tangible and nontangible support. Fu-
ture studies might seek to ascertain whether certain types of
help are offered to parents and other types to offspring in
different families. We note that the support scale showed the
same rank order and high alphas for parents and offspring,
suggesting that generational disparities are consistent across
types of support.
The study also relied on self-reports of support from only
one member of the family. Dyadic research suggests that
adults may overreport what they provide in comparison
with what family members report receiving (Attias-Donfut
& Wolff, 2000). Here, we examined disparities of support to
members of different generations, however, and there is no
reason to expect participants' reporting biases to vary by
generation.
Moreover, we did not consider the societal context of
support to generations. The United States has relatively few
government support programs to assist young people aged
18 years and older (Cook & Furstenberg, 2002; Grundy &
Henretta, 2006). Although scholars lament the lack of sup-
port for aging adults, older adults typically have social secu-
rity and Medicare, programs unavailable to healthy young
adults. As such, support of grown offspring may partially
reflect middle-aged parents' compensation for lack of soci-
etal support.
In sum, middle-aged adults provided support to genera-
tions above and below in response to their needs and the
importance of the relationship. In most families, support
flowed downstream, with middle-aged adults providing
more support to grown children than to aging parents. The
normative pattern of downstream support reflected transi-
tions of young adulthood, which involve dependency (e.g.,
student) or being unconnected (e.g., single). Likewise, the
importance that middle-aged adults placed on a relationship
partner contributed to support the partner received. When an
elderly parent was disabled or suffered problems, middle-
aged adults provided more support to aging parents than to
offspring, however. Indeed, it seems that much everyday as-
sistance occurs in everyday contexts. As such, a majority of
middle-aged adults in the early 21st century engage in a
downstream flow of support to each of their progeny, but
they may divert from this pattern when elderly parents'
needs are pressing or urgent.
