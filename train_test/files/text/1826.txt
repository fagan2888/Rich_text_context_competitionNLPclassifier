amma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is present in
serum and the surface of most cell types, and is
the enzyme responsible for initiating extracellular
catabolism of glutathione, the main antioxidant in mam-
malian cells.
1 Increased GGT activity may be a response to
oxidative stress, which can increase the transport of gluta-
thione precursors into cells.
1,2 Recent reports also indicate a
direct role for GGT in the generation of reactive oxygen
species.
2­6 In this context, emerging evidence from epidemi-
ological studies indicates that GGT may have a role in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus
and metabolic syndrome.
7­9 Similarly, recent cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies have also noted a relatively inde-
pendent association between elevated serum GGT levels
and hypertension.
9­14 However, for hypertension, with the
exception of recent results from the biracial Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)
Study, data from non-Caucasian race-ethnicities in the
USA are limited.
9 Also, in light of the overall positive as-
sociation between serum GGT and clinical hypertension
reported in previous epidemiological studies, it is not entire-
ly clear if there is a continuous dose­response relationship

in this association or if this association is evident only
beyond a particular threshold level of serum GGT. Further,
currently there is little data available on the association
between serum GGT level and clinically relevant blood
pressure (BP) categories earlier in the disease continuum
when hypertension prevention efforts may be applicable.
Prehypertension, as defined by the Seventh Joint National
Committee (JNC7) on prevention, detection, evaluation
and treatment of high blood pressure and including those
with systolic BP ranging from 120­139mmHg or diastolic
BP ranging from 80­89mmHg, is identified as a predictor
for developing hypertension and a stage were primary
prevention of hypertension is possible.
15­17 In this context,
we examined the association between serum GGT levels
and prehypertension in a nationally representative sample
of US adults, who were free of hypertension, participating
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2002, after adjusting for several impor-
tant confounders. We also employed non-parametric ana-
lytical techniques to examine the dose­response nature of
the association between serum GGT levels and prehyper-
tension graphically.

Association Between Serum Gamma-Glutamyltransferase
Level and Prehypertension Among US Adults
Anoop Shankar, MD, PhD; Jialiang Li, PhD*
Background Higher serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels, a marker of oxidative stress, are impli-
cated in the development and progression of hypertension; however, data from non-Caucasian ethnicities are
limited. Also, currently there is little data available on the association between serum GGT level and clinically
relevant blood pressure (BP) categories earlier in the disease continuum, when hypertension prevention efforts
may be applicable. The association between serum GGT and prehypertension was examined in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of US adults.
Methods and Results Cross-sectional study among 5,827 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999­2002 participants aged 18 years without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. The main out-
come-of-interest was the presence of prehypertension (systolic BP 120­139mmHg or diastolic BP 80­89mmHg)
(n=2,269). Higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension, independent of smoking,
waist circumference, diabetes, cholesterol levels and other confounders. The multivariable odds ratio (95%confi-
dence intervals) comparing quartile 4 of GGT (>29U/L) to quartile 1 (<13U/L) was 1.84 (1.37­2.46), p<0.0001.
This association persisted in separate analyses among men and women. The results were consistent in subgroup
analyses by race-ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist circumference and diabetes. In
non-parametric models, the positive association between serum GGT and prehypertension appeared to be present
across the full range of GGT, without any threshold effect.
Conclusions Higher serum GGT levels are associated with prehypertension in a nationally representative
sample of US adults, free of CVD and hypertension. (Circ J 2007; 71: 1567­1572)

stratified multistage probability sample based on selection
of counties, blocks, households and individuals within
households and included the oversampling of non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans to provide stable estimates
for these groups. Subjects signed a consent form, and ap-
proval was obtained from the Human Subjects Committee
in the US Department of Health and Human Service.
Overall, 9,836 adults 18 years of age participated in
the interview and examination components of NHANES
1999­2002. Of these participants, systolic and diastolic BP
was available for 9,483 participants (96%). We further
excluded (not mutually exclusive categories) participants
with prevalent hypertension (n=3,109), participants with
missing covariable data (eg, serum total cholesterol) (n=
578) and participants with self-reported history of cardio-
vascular disease (n=891), including coronary heart disease,
myocardial infarction, angina or stroke. This resulted in
5,827 normotensive participants who were included for all
analyses. Out of the 5,827 normotensive participants, 2,269
had prehypertension.
Main Outcome of Interest: Presence of Prehypertension
Seated systolic and diastolic BPs were measured using
a mercury sphygmomanometer according to the American
Heart Association and JNC7 recommendations.
15,18 Up to 3
measurements were averaged for systolic and diastolic pres-
sures. Patients were considered hypertensive if they reported
current BP-reducing medication use and/or had systolic
BPs 140mmHg and/or diastolic BPs 90mmHg.
15 In the
current analysis, we excluded participants with hyperten-
sion. The preferred outcome of interest in the current study
was the presence of prehypertension, defined as systolic
BP 120­139mmHg systolic or diastolic BP 80­89mmHg
based on JNC7 criteria.
15
Exposure Measurements
Age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol in-
take (g/day), level of education, history of diabetes and oral
hypoglycemic drug intake or insulin administration, hyper-
tension and antihypertensive medication were assessed
using a questionnaire. Individuals who had not smoked
100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were considered never
smokers, those who had smoked 100 cigarettes in their
lifetimes were considered former smokers if they answered
negatively to the question "Do you smoke now?" and cur-
rent smokers if they answered affirmatively. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. After asking the participant to
lift up their shirt, waist circumference was measured at the
iliac crest to the nearest 0.1cm.
Detailed descriptions about blood collection and proc-
essing are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual.
18 Serum GGT concentra-
tion was assayed with a Hitachi 737 Analyzer (Boehringer-
Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at White
Sands Research Center, Alamogordo, New Mexico (USA);
details of laboratory measurements are available online.
18
Serum total cholesterol was measured enzymatically. Serum
glucose was measured at the University of Missouri Dia-
betes Diagnostic Laboratory using a modified hexokinase
enzymatic method. Glycosylated hemoglobin was also
measured at the University of Missouri using a boronate
affinity high-performance liquid chromatography system.
Diabetes was defined using American Diabetes Association
criteria as follows: a serum glucose 126mg/dl after fasting
for a minimum of 8h, a serum glucose 200mg/dl for those
who fasted <8h before their NHANES visit, or self-reported
current use of oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin.
Statistical Analysis
Because of their skewed distributions, serum GGT was
log-transformed (base 2) when initially analyzed as a con-
tinuous variable. We examined serum GGT level as quar-
tiles: <13U/L, 13­19U/L, 20­29U/L and >29U/L. Initial
analyses based on gender-specific GGT quartiles gave simi-
lar results as GGT quartiles for the whole cohort; cutoffs for
the whole cohort were therefore used to simplify the pres-
ented tables. The odds ratio (OR) (95%confidence interval
(CI)) of prehypertension was calculated for each GGT
level, with the lowest quartile as the reference, using multi-
variable logistic regression models. We used 2 models: the
age (years), sex-adjusted model; and the multivariable
model additionally adjusted for race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),
education categories (<high school, high school, >high
school), smoking (never, former, current), alcohol intake
(g/day), waist circumference (cm), diabetes (absent, pres-
ent), glycosylated hemoglobin level (%) and serum choles-
terol (mg/dl). Trends in the OR of prehypertension across
increasing serum GGT category were determined modeling
GGT categories as an ordinal variable. To examine the con-
sistency of the observed association between serum GGT
levels and prehypertension, we performed subgroup ana-
lyses by gender, race-ethnicity (Non-Hispanic whites,
African Americans, Mexican-Americans and others), age
(<60, 60 years), current smoking (absent, present), current
drinking (absent, present), BMI (<25, 25kg/m2), waist
circumference (low [men <102cm, women <88cm], high
[men 102cm, women 88cm]), and diabetes mellitus
(absent, present).
20 In a supplementary analysis, to examine
if the observed association between serum GGT and pre-
hypertension was explained by inflammation, we addition-
ally adjusted for C-reactive protein levels (mg/L) in the
multivariable model. Sample weights that account for the
unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling and non-
response were applied for all analyses using SUDAAN
(version 8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC, USA) and SAS (version 9.2.; SAS institute, Cary,
NC, USA) softwares; standard errors were estimated using
the Taylor series linearization method. To examine the
dose­response relationship between the observed associa-
tion between GGT levels and prehypertension without line-
arity assumptions, we used flexible non-parametric logistic
regression employing the generalized additive modeling ap-
proach (R system for statistical computing, available from
Comprehensive R Archive Network [http://www.CRAN.
R-project.org]) to calculate the odds of prehypertension,
adjusting for all covariates in the multivariable model. The
odds of prehypertension were then plotted against increas-
ing GGT levels (both on the log scale).

sion and cardiovascular disease included in the current
analysis, 2,269 subjects had prehypertension. Table1 pres-

higher waist circumference, higher glycosylated hemoglo-
bin levels, total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein levels;
and to be less likely to have a post-high school education
than those with lower serum GGT. Mean systolic and dias-
tolic BP and the prevalence of prehypertension increased
with increasing GGT categories.
Table2 presents the ORs of prehypertension with in-
creasing serum GGT quartile. Increasing GGT quartiles
were positively associated with prehypertension in both the
age, sex-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted models;
models evaluating trends in this association were also
statistically significant. When serum GGT was analyzed as
a continuous variable, the positive association with pre-
hypertension persisted. In Table3, we present the gender-
specific analysis for the association between increasing
GGT levels and prehypertension. A clear positive associa-
tion between GGT and prehypertension was present both
among men and women.
In Table4, we examined the OR of prehypertension
associated with increasing levels of log-transformed serum
GGT within subgroups of race-ethnicity, age, current smok-
ing, current drinking, BMI, waist circumference and dia-
betes mellitus. In general, the positive association between
higher GGT level and prehypertension was consistently
present within these subgroups also and the OR estimates
in Table4 ranged from 1.20 to 1.61.
We then employed non-parametric models to examine
if the observed positive association between serum GGT
and prehypertension was present across the full range of
GGT levels available in the present study (Fig1). Among
the adults without clinical hypertension examined in the
present study, overall, there appeared to be a continuous

increasing GGT levels; there was no evidence of any
threshold effect. On closer examination, the dose­response
association between serum GGT and prehypertension
appeared to be most evident at serum GGT levels within
normal limits (approximately <55g/L).
In a supplementary analysis, to examine if the observed
association between serum GGT and prehypertension was
explained by inflammation, we additionally adjusted for
C-reactive protein levels (mg/dl) in the multivariable model
in Table2. The results were essentially similar. Compared
to serum GGT quartile 1 (referent), the OR (95%CI) of pre-
hypertension was 1.55 (1.22­1.97) in quartile 2, 1.90 (1.44­
2.49) in quartile 3 and 2.58 (1.92­3.48) in quartile 4;
p<0.0001. In a second supplementary analysis, we exam-
ined the association between quartiles of serum GGT and
hypertension. Consistent with the results for prehyperten-
sion, we observed a dose-dependent, positive association
between increasing serum GGT and hypertension. Com-
pared to subjects in serum GGT quartile 1 (referent), the
multivariable OR (95% CI) of hypertension was 1.14
(0.94­1.38) in quartile 2, 1.37 (1.12­1.67) in quartile 3 and
1.78 (1.37­2.30), in quartile 4; p<0.0001.
Discussion
Higher serum GGT levels were found to be positively
associated with prehypertension in a representative sample
of US adults, free of hypertension and cardiovascular dis-
ease. This association persisted after adjusting for age, sex,
race-ethnicity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake,
diabetes mellitus, glycosylated hemoglobin levels and
serum cholesterol, and was consistently present in subgroup
analysis by gender and important confounders. The OR of
prehypertension increased in a dose-dependent manner with
increasing quartiles of serum GGT. In a subsequent analy-
sis, employing nonparametric models, the observed positive
association between serum GGT quartiles and prehyperten-
sion was present continuously across the full range of GGT.
Our results are in agreement with the current understanding
of the role of GGT in hyerptension development, and fur-
ther contribute to the current literature by: (1) suggesting
that GGT levels are related to clinically relevant BP stages
even earlier in the disease continuum, including prehyper-
tension when primary prevention is possible; and (2) dem-
onstrating the association between GGT and prehyperten-
sion among major race-ethnicities in the USA.
9,13,14,17,22
Our finding of a positive association between higher
serum GGT level and prehypertension shows high internal
validity, as shown by the magnitude of this association; in-
dependence from related factors such as smoking, alcohol
intake, waist circumference and diabetes mellitus; dose­
response trend in nonparametric models; and the consisten-
cy of this association in subgroup analyses by gender, race
and several other factors. In nonparametric models, the
dose­response relation between GGT and prehypertension
appeared to be most evident at serum GGT levels within
normal limits (<55g/L), a finding consistent with previous
reports looking at hypertension.
14 In the current study, the
observed association between serum GGT and prehyper-
tension was present among non-drinkers also and persisted
after adjusting for grams of alcohol intake among current
drinkers. As serum GGT is also a marker of alcohol intake,
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis of an asso-
ciation with prehypertension independent of alcohol intake.
1
These results are also in agreement with previous cross-
sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies that
reported a positive association between higher serum GGT
level and clinical hypertension, and extend the evidence to
the earlier stage of prehypertension, when primary preven-
tion of hypertension is possible.
9­14,17
Several lines of recent evidence suggest that an asso-
ciation between serum GGT and hypertension is plausible,
including a direct role of GGT in the generation of reactive
oxygen species; an indirect role as a marker of increased ex-
tracellular catabolism of antioxidant glutathione in response
to oxidative stress; its predictive relationship to future
elevations in plasma F2-isoprostanes, an oxidative damage
product of arachidonic acid; its relationship to markers of
inflammation; and its relationship to insulin resistance and
components of the metabolic syndrome.
1­6,8,9,23,24 Also,
serum GGT has been shown to be associated with reduced
kidney function among men without hypertension or dia-
betes.
25
As the current study examined a nationally representative
sample of US adults, these results are generalizable to US
adults. Furthermore, all data were collected following rigor-
ous methodology, including a study protocol with quality
control checks as discussed in the NHANES website.
18,19
The main study limitation is the cross-sectional nature of
NHANES, which precludes conclusions regarding the
temporal nature of the association between serum GGT and
prehypertension.
In conclusion, higher serum GGT levels were found to be
positively associated with prehypertension in a representa-
tive sample of US adults. Approximately 31% of US adults
are reported to have prehypertension, a stage with higher
risk of converting to clinical hypertension, but when primary
prevention is still possible.
16,17,26 In the light of our findings,
a corollary observation is that subjects with prehypertension
may be a good target group for future hypertension preven-
tion trials that aim to reduce serum GGT levels through
interventions based on nutritional or lifestyle factors shown
to be inversely associated with serum GGT in observational
studies.
