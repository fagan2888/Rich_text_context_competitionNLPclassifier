Article
A substantial amount of research has provided support for
improving learning outcomes by engaging students in hands-
on, laboratory-based activities within the college classroom.
Instructors can create a community of active, rather than pas-
sive, learners through techniques such as problem-based
group activities (Drouin, 2010; Kreiner, 2009; Williams,
2007), service learning (Connor-Greene, 2002), student-led
discussion groups (White, 1978), and cooperative learning
(Carlsmith & Cooper, 2002; Thompson, Vermette, &
Wisniewski, 2004). However, incorporating these techniques
into the classroom comes with its challenges; for example, it
is often challenging to convince students to embrace coop-
erative learning or, as they are used to calling it, "group
work." As Giordano and Yost Hammer (1999) posit, it is
wise to anticipate that students are going to be resistant to
"group work." Therefore, cooperative learning depends on
the ability of the instructor to convey the value of working
with their peers and to effectively facilitate group projects.
Diane Halpern's guidelines for cooperative learning can
be used to anticipate, and address, issues of students'percep-
tions of working in groups, and set up an environment that
will encourage cooperative, problem-based learning
(Halpern, 2011). These guidelines include making sure that
there are never more than four students in a group and that
students are strategically assigned to groups. Halpern also
encourages a degree of positive interdependence, while also
incorporating methods of keeping individual group members
accountable for their contributions. In this model, the role of
the professor is to act as a facilitator, someone who can
resolve conflict within groups, and ensure that the problem-
solving discussions are interactive and inclusive of all stu-
dents (Halpern, 2011).
Today, many colleges are revising their curriculum to fol-
low a laboratory learning model, which creates laboratories
inside and outside of the classroom, and often depend on
cooperative learning-based projects. Experts in the field of
education describe this model as providing, "alternatives to
lectures and `recitation'; they are a clarion call for hands-on
learning and social interaction among students with each
other and collectively amongst faculty, staff and students"
(DeCiccio, 2009, p. 79). However, it is also acknowledged
that there are challenges to the laboratory-based model such
as getting undergraduate students to appreciate the value of
laboratory activities within a research methods course
(Strategies for Success, 1999), particularly when they are
more familiar with the traditional lecture-based approach.
According to Lewandowski and Sizemore (2011),
research methods courses present unique challenges in terms

Laboratory Learning in a Research
Methods Course: Successes and
Challenges
Sarah Knapp1
Abstract
Laboratory-based learning is increasingly considered to be an integral component of undergraduate education. However,
students do not always perceive the value of laboratory learning in the college classroom. The current research sought to
create an effective laboratory learning environment within a research methods course and to assess students' perceptions of
this approach at the end of one semester. This article reports the findings for two studies; in Study 1, a survey was given to 17
criminal justice, health care management and advocacy, and psychology students. In a subsequent semester, challenges from
Study 1 were addressed, and the same survey (i.e., Study 2) was given to 20 criminal justice and psychology majors. Across
both samples, students' responses to the laboratory learning paradigm were generally positive, yet concerns and challenges
were identified. Future research should attempt to address these concerns and to assess objective student outcomes, such
as grades in the course.

of students' perceptions and attitudes; among these chal-
lenges are that while students may be "learning," they may
not be "liking" the course because they see research methods
as one of those courses that you just have to get through to
graduate. Furthermore, although students seem to understand
the utility of biological research, this may not extend to
social research. Finally, because statistics, research methods,
and writing courses are often taught separately, students may
not be integrating their knowledge of all three together
(Lewandowski & Sizemore, 2011). Dr. Lewandowski's
excellent mentorship contributed greatly to this project.
The rationale of the following two studies was to design,
and improve upon, a research methods course that would
reflect the need to integrate statistics, methodology, and writ-
ing (Lewandowski & Sizemore, 2011) using a laboratory
learning approach (DeCiccio, 2009) and guidelines for set-
ting up an effective cooperative learning environment
(Halpern, 2011). The major goals were to foster students'
perceptions of the value of laboratory learning, to instill an
appreciation of research methods in the social sciences, and
to improve student learning outcomes through cooperative
learning projects with their peers. The successes and chal-
lenges of this approach are reported, and future directions
identified.
Study 1
The goal of Study 1 was to create an environment that would
promote laboratory learning throughout one semester of an
undergraduate social research course. As this type of curricu-
lum continues to be emphasized in higher education, it is
important that best practices in delivering such a curriculum
be identified and embraced by students. Furthermore, cele-
brating successes and responding to challenges in an attempt
to grow as teachers and as learners will lead to a more suc-
cessful and knowledgeable community in institutions of
higher education.
Method
Participants.Participants in Study 1 were 17 undergraduate
students (65% female) between 20 and 35 years of age (M =
22 years). These students were enrolled in a research meth-
ods course at a 4-year liberal arts institution that is required
for all psychology, health care management and advocacy,
and criminal justice majors. In Study 1, 10 of these students
were psychology majors, four were majoring in criminal jus-
tice, and three students were health care management and
advocacy majors. When asked about their status at the col-
lege, eight of them reported that they were seniors, graduat-
ing the following semester, eight of them were juniors at the
college, and only one student was a sophomore. Finally, 80%
of the participants had plans to attend graduate school at
some point in their future. This was a convenience sample;
the purpose of the survey was described to all students in the
class, and on the day of the final exam, the students were
given the opportunity to complete the survey for extra credit
on the final. They were also told that if they chose not to
complete the survey, they could sit quietly at their desks, and
request an alternative extra credit assignment after class was
over. The completed (or uncompleted) consent forms served
as the method of assigning extra credit, or alternative extra
credit assignments. On the day of the final exam, 100% of
students in the course provided informed consent to partici-
pate in a survey on cooperative and laboratory learning and
received bonus points on their final exam.
Materials. The first set of Likert-type scale questions on the
survey, which addressed students' perceptions of the effec-
tiveness of laboratory learning, were adapted from Drouin's
(2010) Formative Summative Assessment (FSA); partici-
pants were instructed to rate their responses on a scale of 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to such items as
"The laboratory projects were a good way to practice key
concepts that we were learning in class." The second set of
Likert-type scale questions on the survey, which addressed
students' perceptions of the effectiveness of cooperative
learning, were adapted from a course evaluation survey
developed by Thompson et al. (2004); participants were
instructed to rate their responses on a scale of 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to items such as "every person
in the group had an opportunity to share his or her ideas."
Finally, based on a qualitative summary developed by Carl-
smith and Cooper (2002), students were asked to describe
their thoughts, feelings, and/or observations about at least
three positive and three negative aspects of working in small
groups on the laboratory projects.
Design. The data for this study were collected using a survey
containing 14 questions that took approximately 10 to 15
min for each student to complete. Twelve questions were
Likert-type, close-ended scale questions, and the last two
questions on the survey were open ended. After the data were
collected, it was entered into Microsoft Excel, and the fre-
quencies and means were calculated for each scale question.
The open-ended questions were organized into themes that
followed the Halpern (2011) guidelines for cooperative
learning, which were used to structure the course.
Procedure.A course in social research cross-listed in the
criminal justice, health care management and advocacy, and
psychology majors was organized around the concept of lab-
oratory learning during a fall semester. The class met on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays with an extra session on
Wednesday afternoons for 14 weeks during which students
completed eight laboratory projects in small groups through-
out the semester. At the end of the course, students were
given an opportunity to participate in an institutional review
board (IRB)-approved survey that elicited their feedback
about these laboratory sessions.
Knapp 3
The course was structured so that students knew what to
expect each week. Monday and Wednesday mornings
(Session I) were focused on discussing content and theory,
including what they had learned from their reading for that
week. Wednesday afternoon (Session II) consisted of prob-
lem-based laboratory assignments. Students were random-
ized into groups, ensuring that group membership was
different each week and students were able to work with each
one of their peers at least once. Students completed their
laboratory reports and forms rating each group member's
contribution (including their own), and submitted one labo-
ratory report as a group. On Friday, laboratory reports were
handed back and discussed, with the professor identifying
and addressing any remaining issues with the material.
As an example of one laboratory project, in the unit on
survey research, the entire class decided to construct a survey
on the everyday life of college students. Students were then
divided into groups of four, and each group wrote five survey
questions on one specific topic (i.e., athletics, the dorm, the
library, the classroom, and the dining hall) to be included in
the survey. Each group also hypothesized a relationship
between two survey questions: one of their own questions and
one from another group. Every student in the class collected
data from five students at the institution, entered the survey
responses into one database, and analyzed the correlation
between their hypothesized variables. In Study 1, the groups
then wrote and submitted one laboratory report together, and
in Study 2, each student wrote an individual lab report. For a
brief description of each lab, see Table 1.
Results and Discussion
Overall, results showed that on an FSA, a 5-point Likert-type
scale created by Drouin (2010), students enjoyed the struc-
ture of the labs (M = 3.75), found the labs useful (M = 4.10),
and especially liked that the labs gave them an opportunity to
practice and apply key concepts they were learning in the
class (M = 4.25; see Figure 1). On a 5-point Likert-type scale
assessing their perceptions of cooperative learning
(Thompson et al., 2004), students reported that they learned
more because they had the opportunity to explain things to
their peers (M = 4.00), and felt that they completed the labs
more successfully together than they would have on their
own (M = 3.65; see Figure 2).
The positive and negative comments provided by students
could easily be organized according to the guidelines set forth
by Diane Halpern and used to design this course (see Table 2).
Their positive comments showed that students who would
normally be too shy to participate were given the opportunity
to share their opinions and thoughts about the course material.
They also appreciated the opportunity to get acquainted with,
and learn from, their classmates. Finally, they felt that the lab-
oratory projects allowed them to apply the information they
were learning in class, leading to a better understanding of the
material. In terms of the negative comments, students reported
that it was sometimes difficult to include everyone in the con-
versation, and some of the laboratory project goals or instruc-
tions were unclear. However, most of the negative comments
were related to individual accountability and conflict among

Lab title Problem
Lab 1: Science vs.
pseudoscience
Use seven characteristics of pseudoscience to determine which characteristics are used by
advertisements in the media.
Lab 2: Working
with variables
Determine whether a series of hypotheses should be tested with experimental or non-experimental
methods, identify independent and dependent variables, and provide operational definitions.
Lab 3: Ethics and
the IRB
Each group is given a proposed study and asked to evaluate the proposal based on the principles of the
Belmont Report (1979) and to complete an informed consent form for that proposed study.
Lab 4: Library
research
Group members choose a research question and use electronic resources through the library to find
articles on that question. Then, they identify their keywords, and summarize their findings.
Lab 5: Naturalistic
observation
Each group proposes a study that will use naturalistic observation; when the proposal is approved by the
professor, they complete observations, and together come up with three themes that emerged from
their field notes. This is a two-part lab (taking place over 2 weeks).
Lab 6: Survey
research
The class came up with a survey topic, and each group contributed a section of the survey (five questions
total). Once the entire survey was compiled (by the professor or course apprentice), students
collected the data, entered it into Excel, and analyzed a correlation between one of their variables and
a variable from another group. In Study 2, students completed individual lab reports.
Lab 7:
Experimental
research
The professor (or course apprentice) set up cups filled with different brands of soda. The students
blindly tasted each brand and answered a series of survey questions. This was a within-subjects
experiment. Once the survey responses were compiled by the professor, each group was given one
variable on which to perform an analysis of variance. In Study 2, students completed individual lab
reports. (Note: this is a twist on the original Pepsi Challenge in 1975; Bhasin, 2011).
Lab 8: Final project In Study 1, each student completed an article analysis. In Study 2, students chose their own group
members and completed a research project.

group members; students felt that not all group members con-
tributed equally and individual grades did not necessarily
reflect that. Also, disagreement among group members was
difficult to solve due to conflicting personalities and level of
effort. Finally, there were no comments, positive or negative,
in terms of perceptions of the teacher as a facilitator, or coach,
in the classroom.
Overall, the data show that students embraced the labora-
tory projects throughout this course. The structure of the
laboratory projects learned to better understanding of course
material, relationships with classmates, and opportunities to
participate in class. However, there were also clear chal-
lenges reported in the open-ended positive and negative
comments, in particular, the occasional lack of participation
from peers, questionable fairness of individual accountabil-
ity, and conflict among group members.
Study 2
The goal of Study 2 was to address the issues raised by stu-
dents' open-ended responses from Study 1 in a subsequent
semester, keeping as many other elements of the original
course structure, as well as the survey given at the end, as
consistent with Study 1 as possible.Afew important changes
were made in the structure of the course in an attempt to
improve students' perceptions of laboratory learning in
research methods. Such changes included increasing the
individual accountability of each member in the small
groups, adding a course apprentice as another source of
support to students in the class, clarifying the instructions
and goals of the laboratory assignments, without changing
the content of each lab from one semester to the next, and
finally adding a more substantial final project that would
allow students to choose their own groups and end the
course on a positive lesson in cooperative learning.
Method
Participants. Twenty undergraduate students (47% female) in a
social research course at a 4-year liberal arts college between
20 and 36 years of age (M = 22 years) completed this study.
These students were enrolled in a research methods course at a
4-year liberal arts institution that is required for all psychology,
health care management and advocacy, and criminal justice
majors. In Study 2, 12 of these students were psychology
majors and eight were majoring in criminal justice. There were
no health care management and advocacy students. When
asked about their status at the college, 13 of them reported that
they were seniors, graduating the following semester; five of
them were juniors at the college; and two students were sopho-
mores. Finally, 62% of the participants had plans to attend
graduate school at some point in their future. The sampling was
identical to Study 1. This was, once again, a convenience sam-
ple. After the purpose of the study was described to all students,
they were given the opportunity to complete the survey, or an
alternative assignment, to count as extra credit toward the final
exam grade. Eighty-one percent of the students in the course
elected to complete the survey.
Materials.The materials used in Study 2 were exactly the
same as those in Study 1. The survey contained seven Likert-
type questions adapted from Drouin's (2010) FSA and five

Likert-type questions adapted from a course evaluation sur-
vey developed by Thompson et al. (2004). Finally, students
were asked to describe at least three positive and three nega-
tive aspects of working in small groups on the laboratory
projects (Carlsmith & Cooper, 2002).
Design.The design for Study 2 was also identical to the
design for Study 1; the same study materials were used with
no differences or changes made. These materials included a
14-question survey that took students approximately 10 to 15
min to complete. Again, 12 questions were Likert-type,
close-ended scale questions, analyzed in Microsoft Excel,
and the last two open-ended questions on the survey were
organized into themes that followed the Halpern (2011)
guidelines for cooperative learning.
Procedure.As aforementioned, the goal of this study was to
improve the course, focusing on issues raised by students in
Study 1 while keeping all other elements consistent. Both
courses were taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
during the fall semester; were of a similar size; and consisted
of criminal justice, health care management and advocacy,
and psychology majors. The lab assignments were very simi-
lar throughout the semester, as was the general structure of
the course, and the same textbook was used for both courses.
Once again, Diane Halpern's guidelines for cooperative
learning were followed to anticipate issues and set up an
environment that would encourage an understanding and
acceptance of laboratory learning.
A few changes were made to the course to address the
issues raised in Study 1. At the conclusion of Study 1, stu-
dents'negative perceptions of the laboratory-based approach
to the research methods course rested mostly in the area of
individual accountability; they felt that individual grades
were unfair, and that some group members did not partici-
pate or contribute to the group in a meaningful way. As
aforementioned, improving the perception of cooperative
learning among students is a major goal of this research.
Therefore, at the beginning of the next semester, the instruc-
tor spent a significant amount of time emphasizing the value
of cooperative learning in a research methods course. A sec-
tion on cooperative learning was included in the syllabus,
and most of the first class meeting of the semester was spent
allowing students to create their own cooperative learning
contract. Each week, every member of every group received
the contract, read it, and signed it, agreeing to abide by its
guidelines or receive a penalty in their grade. Finally, stu-
dents completed individual lab reports for the three major lab
projects (naturalistic observation, survey, and experimental
design) and were allowed to choose their own group for the
final project based on their success (or failures) with the
groups they had formed during the semester.
Another area of concern from Study 1 was that there were
no comments, positive or negative, in terms of perceptions of
the teacher as a facilitator, or coach, in the classroom. To
improve the perceptions of educator as facilitator, an upper-
classman who had performed very well in the course was
made a course apprentice as part of our Course Apprentice
Program (CAP). This way, there would be more than one
leader in the classroom to facilitate learning and to support
the students both individually and in their groups.
Furthermore, there was some confusion about the instruc-
tions and overall goals for some of the laboratory assign-
ments, which may have led to some disagreements or
ineffective discussion among group members. To remedy
this, minor clarifications were made in the laboratory assign-
ments based on the previous semesters' suggestions.
However, the content of the laboratory assignments was not
changed. For example, in Lab 2: Working with variables, the
instructor originally presented the students with two vari-
ables and instructed them to write a hypothesis, decide
whether the method used to test the hypothesis should be
experimental or non-experimental, identify the independent
and dependent variables, and operationalize each variable.
This turned out to be too advanced for the students in week 2
of the course, and different groups came up with different
scenarios, so the answers were not standardized. Therefore,
in the subsequent semester, the same research questions and
variables were presented to students, but the hypothesis
statement was already written out for them. That way, all stu-
dents were working from identical hypotheses, rather than
some groups using one variable as the independent variable,
and other groups using that same variable as the dependent
variable. They were then asked, from that hypothesis, to
identify the appropriate method, and the independent and
dependent variables, and operationalize them.
Finally, it seemed inconsistent to the goals of the course to
make the final project an individual article analysis when the
rest of the laboratory projects had been completed in groups.
Therefore, in Study 2, the final project was a study designed,
conducted, analyzed, and presented in groups formed by the
students based on their previous experience with students in
the class. This allowed the course to end on a positive note in
terms of the amount of work that can be accomplished when
cooperative learning is involved.
Results and Discussion
Once again, results showed that students embraced labora-
tory learning in the classroom. Responses on the FSA were
very similar between Studies 1 and 2. Students enjoyed the
structure of the labs (M = 3.71 in Study 2, M = 3.75 in Study
1), found the labs useful (M = 3.94 in Study 2, M = 4.10 in
Study 1), and especially liked that the labs gave them an
opportunity to practice and apply key concepts they were
learning in the class (M = 4.06 in Study 2, M = 4.25 in
Study 1; see Figure 3). Although the responses on the FSA
were very similar between Studies 1 and 2, agreement with
two of the statements on the perceptions of cooperative
learning scale was markedly higher. In Study 2, students
6 SAGE Open
agreed more with the statements that every person in their
groups had the opportunity to share their ideas (M = 4.18 in
Study 2, M = 3.60 in Study 1), and that they encouraged each
other to contribute ideas within the group (M =4.24 in Study
2, M = 3.25 in Study 1; see Figure 4). This may be explained
by the changes that were made in the course between Study
1 and Study 2, most importantly the addition of a course
apprentice to provide support for the students, the creation of
a cooperative learning contract signed by all the students in
the class, and the fact that students were allowed to choose
their own group for the final project.
Finally, the positive and negative comments provided by
students were once again consistent with the guidelines used
to organize the course (see Table 3). However, the comments
from Study 2 were much more multifaceted, and there were
more positive comments than in Study 1. Once again, stu-
dents felt that working together on hands-on projects lead to a
better understanding of course material, and they appreciated
the opportunity to feel closer to, and learn from their class-
mates. However, they also reported that sharing the workload
helped them to finish the assignments faster and more accu-
rately, the new cooperative learning contracts increased indi-
vidual efforts (but could be enforced more), and the structure
of the class allowed students to improve their communication
and teamwork skills. Also, including the course apprentice in
the class seemed to have led to an understanding of the teacher
as a facilitator in the classroom. The course apprentice was
seen as being available to answer questions when the teacher
was not, and peers were able to provide feedback when the
teacher was unavailable or unclear.
In terms of negative comments, students reported that
sometimes they were distracted or went off-topic in their
group discussions, and it was difficult to work with students
outside of class (on their final project) due to their busy sched-
ules and failure to communicate. Similar to Study 1, students
also reported that on some weeks (i.e., in certain groups) some
students did not participate as much as others, and that because
the groups were always different, some personality types con-
flicted and it was difficult to settle arguments.
Overall, the data from Study 2 showed similar results to
Study 1, with obvious improvement on perceptions of labo-
ratory learning, and positive comments. However, there were
also the challenges presented by the occasional lack of par-
ticipation from peers and conflict among group members
persisted.

Summary and Concluding Discussion
Students in Study 1 and Study 2 seemed to appreciate the
cooperative, problem-based, laboratory learning approach to
research methods. Participants seemed to realize both the
social and educational benefits of working with their peers
on difficult concepts within the course. However, the changes
implemented in Study 2 (e.g., the addition of a course appren-
tice, the emphasis on the importance of cooperative learning,
and the revision of laboratory projects to increase individual
accountability) improved students' perceptions in a few
important ways. First, students reported feeling slightly
closer to their classmates, had a little more enjoyment when
working with their peers, and more desire to complete labo-
ratory projects in other courses (see Figure 5). Second, every
mean on the perceptions measure was higher, except for one;
students did not report a better understanding of the material
in Study 2 (see Figure 6). Perhaps the most striking improve-
ment occurred in the open-ended responses. Overall,
responses were much more positive, and multifaceted. This
might be an indication that students recognized and appreci-
ated more specific elements of the course than in Study 1. It
may also indicate, however, that the laboratory learning
model adopted across the curriculum of the entire college is
also being viewed more favorably.
This study had a few strengths. First, in both studies, a
high percentage of students in the class agreed to partici-
pate (100% in Study 1 and 81% in Study 2), and I have
every reason to believe that their responses were open and
honest. Also, a majority of the students in each study had
plans to attend graduate school (80% in Study 1 and 62% in
Study 2), so the success of this course was extremely rele-
vant to this population. Furthermore, the idea for this proj-
ect came from a student who had taken the class, and was
able to communicate her concerns, and those of her class-
mates, from firsthand experience. Her contributions were,
and continue to be, essential for the success of this project.
Finally, using Halpern's (2011) guidelines for creating an
effective cooperative learning environment provided an
excellent framework that was useful in setting up, main-
taining, and evaluating this classroom environment.
This study also had a few limitations. First, the results of
these studies are based completely on the subjective accounts
of students in the class. Future studies should collect objec-
tive data such as the effect on exams or overall grades when
working in groups versus working individually. Second, in
both studies, students were given the option to receive extra
credit in return for their participation. This may have
affected their decision to participate, and could have biased
their answers to the survey. Finally, occasional lack of par-
ticipation from peers and the conflict that may result from
this dynamic remain to be examined. It might have been
useful to ask for further elaboration on this, or suggestions
for improvement, to discern whether these were concerns
specific to this course or whether the bias toward individual
work over group work continued to persist.
The results of this study showed that a laboratory learning
environment using cooperative, problem-based laboratory
techniques to teach an undergraduate social research course
across majors can be successful. Overall, students benefitted
from the opportunity to learn from, and to teach their peers.
They also felt more comfortable contributing in small groups
than speaking up in front of the entire class, and applying the
concepts they were learning in class made them feel more
competent with the course material. However, challenges
remain. Groups continue to experience and struggle with
social loafing and conflicting personalities among group
members, even when students are randomly assigned to a
new group for each project. Further research should explore
how to form groups that will work well together and resolve
conflict effectively, and to investigate whether these changes
can improve objective goals in the course, such as an increase
in students' grades.
