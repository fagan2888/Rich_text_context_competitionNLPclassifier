Introduction
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a
prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that affects up
to 20% of adults in North America [Dent et al.
2005; Katz et al. 2013]. National hospitalization
estimates portray GERD as an increasingly com-
mon illness, citing a 216% rise in GERD diagno-
ses between 1998 and 2005 [Zhao and Encinosa,
2008]. GERD develops when the lower esopha-
geal sphincter does not close properly, allowing
stomach contents to return back up the esopha-
gus, most prominently resulting in symptoms of
heartburn, acid regurgitation and erosive
esophagitis (EE) [Zhao and Encinosa, 2008; Katz
et al. 2013]. Current therapies, such as antacids,
histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton-
pump inhibitors (PPIs), aim to reduce acid in the
stomach, though PPIs are the treatment of choice
for relief of GERD symptoms, as well as for heal-
ing of EE [Katz et al. 2013]. PPIs inhibit the

Abstract
Background: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel orally disintegrating
tablet (ODT) formulation of delayed-release dexlansoprazole 30 mg was evaluated versus the
dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsule in this phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, randomized, two-
period crossover study.
Methods: Healthy adults received daily doses of 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODT or 30 mg
dexlansoprazole delayed-release capsule for 5 days during two treatment periods, separated
by a 7-day washout interval. Blood samples for dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations and
intragastric pH measurements were collected through 24 hours postdose on days 1 and 5 of
each period.
Results: Bioequivalence between the 30 mg ODT and 30 mg capsule dosage forms was
demonstrated by the primary endpoints of dexlansoprazole peak concentration (Cmax
) and
systemic exposure (AUC) values contained within the prespecified 90% confidence interval
(CI) range of 0.80­1.25. Additional primary endpoints of intragastric mean pH values and
percentage of time with pH > 4 over the 24-hour postdose interval were equivalent for
dexlansoprazole ODT and dexlansoprazole capsule. Treatment-emergent adverse events
were reported in 23% and 28% of participants receiving the ODT and capsule formulations,
respectively. Headache was the most common adverse event in both treatment regimens
(5.8% with ODT and 6.0% with capsule).
Conclusions: Administration of dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODT or 30 mg capsule provided
equivalent plasma exposure when either was administered as a single dose or as once
daily doses for 5 days. Pharmacodynamic equivalence between the two formulations was
demonstrated by similar intragastric pH parameters on both day 1 and day 5. No effect
of day on dexlansoprazole pharmacokinetics was observed. Dexlansoprazole ODT and
dexlansoprazole capsule were both well tolerated.

hydrogen­potassium adenosine triphosphatase
enzyme (proton pump) at the final step of acid
production, suppressing the secretion of proton
ions in the stomach and increasing intragastric
pH [Shin and Kim, 2013].
Unlike other PPIs, dexlansoprazole is formulated
as a capsule with a dual delayed-release mecha-
nism [Vakily et al. 2009; Takeda Pharmaceuticals
America, Inc., 2016]. Dexlansoprazole is first
released 1­2 hours following ingestion, followed
by a second release within 4­5 hours postdose.
This dual delayed release extends the duration of
drug exposure and maintains pharmacologically
active levels of drug over a longer period of time,
resulting in prolonged elevation of intragastric pH
[Vakily et al. 2009]. The prolonged acid suppres-
sion addresses potential breakthrough heartburn
that might occur at night [Fass et al. 2009; Takeda
Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016]. The phar-
macokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and
safety profiles of dexlansoprazole capsule follow-
ing administration of doses of 30 mg and 60 mg
have been extensively studied in healthy adults
and patients with GERD in randomized, double-
blind, controlled clinical studies [Peura et al.
2009; Wittbrodt et al. 2009]. Both 30 mg and 60
mg strengths of dexlansoprazole capsule have
been shown to be superior to placebo in main-
taining heartburn-free periods in patients with
healed EE or symptomatic nonerosive GERD
[Fass et al. 2009; Metz et al. 2009].
The currently available delayed-release PPIs are
formulated as capsules or tablets that are meant to
be swallowed whole, which may cause problems
for patients with difficulty swallowing. Difficulty
swallowing, or dysphagia, is a common comorbid-
ity in many disease states and is highly prevalent
among patients with stroke, dementia, Parkinson's
disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclero-
sis [Daniels, 2006]. In the general population,
heartburn and/or acid regurgitation were signifi-
cantly associated with comorbid dysphagia [odds
ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI),
2.9­7.4] [Locke et al. 1997]. GERD was the most
common diagnosis in a population-based survey
evaluating prevalence and risk factors for dyspha-
gia, and in another study of dysphagic patients,
PPI use was significantly associated with frequent
(OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.2­4.4) and infrequent (OR,
1.5; 95% CI, 1.3­1.8) dysphagia [Cho et al. 2015].
Dexlansoprazole 30 mg delayed-release cap-
sules are approved for use in adults for relief of
heartburn and maintenance of healed EE for up
to 6 months, as well as 4-week therapy for heart-
burn associated with symptomatic nonerosive
GERD [Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.,
2016]. Dexlansoprazole 60 mg delayed-release
capsules are approved for use in adults for heal-
ing of all grades of EE for up to 8 weeks [Takeda
Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016]. As a
follow-on to the dexlansoprazole capsule formu-
lation, a 30 mg orally disintegrating tablet
(ODT) formulation of dexlansoprazole was
developed and has recently been approved in
the United States for the same indications, that
is, relief of heartburn, maintenance of healed
EE and treatment of heartburn associated with
GERD, as the 30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule
[Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016].
The dexlansoprazole ODT consists of dexlanso-
prazole dual delayed-release microgranules in an
inert, highly water-soluble base. The tablet for-
mulation was designed to disintegrate in the
mouth without chewing or swallowing with water
as an alternative to the dexlansoprazole capsule.
An ODT formulation may be a desirable option
for those unable or unwilling to take oral capsules
[Carnaby-Mann and Crary, 2005; Pahwa, 2010].
The ODT formulation also provides flexibility in
dosing by providing the option of mixing the tab-
let in water and administering the granules orally
via syringe or via nasogastric tube [Kukulka et al.,
manuscript in preparation]. Herein, we report
the findings from a phase I study that evaluated
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
the 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODT relative to the
30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule.
Methods
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties of the dexlansoprazole ODT were inves-
tigated in a phase I, randomized, open-label, sin-
gle-center, two-period crossover study conducted
in healthy adults at Celerion (Tempe, AZ, USA)
between August 2012 and October 2012. The
study was designed in accordance with the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance
for Industry: Bioavailability and Bioequivalence
Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products ­
General Considerations [US Food and Drug
Administration and Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, 2003], approved by the Independent
Investigational Review Board, and conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
the Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good
Clinical Practice [International Conference on

Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use,
2001; World Medical Association, 2013]. Written
informed consent was obtained from each enrollee
prior to the initiation of any study procedure.
Study participants
Healthy male and female adults aged 18­55 years,
weighing at least 50 kg, with a body mass index
 18 and  30 kg/m2 were eligible for inclusion
in the study. Eligible participants were to be in
good health, without evidence of any hemato-
logic, neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, uro-
logic, immunologic, endocrine, or psychiatric dis-
order and no history of malignant disease.
Participants were considered ineligible if they had
recently received agents that could alter hepatic or
renal clearance or that contained caffeine, xanthine
or grapefruit products, or if they had evidence of
drug or alcohol abuse. Routine use of over-the-
counter drugs or nicotine products, or prior use of
any investigational drug was not allowed. Female
participants who were pregnant, lactating, or
intending to either become pregnant or donate
ova before, or 30 days after the study, were also
excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria
included prior use of dexlansoprazole or lansopra-
zole and a known hypersensitivity to any compo-
nent of the dexlansoprazole ODT, dexlansoprazole
capsule, or other PPIs. If any participant violated
the exclusion criteria after randomization, he or
she was removed from the study.
Approximately 52 male and female adults (26 per
treatment sequence) were to be selected for par-
ticipation in the study. This sample size allowed
for up to 6 dropouts (an approximate 12% drop-
out rate) and provided at least 90% probability of
concluding equivalence for dexlansoprazole area
under the plasma-concentration curve (AUC)
between the two treatment regimens if the true
difference between central AUC values was no
more than 5%. The power for concluding equiva-
lence on dexlansoprazole maximum observed
plasma concentration (Cmax
) between the two reg-
imens was expected to be 76%. The sample size
was based on the intrasubject variance of 0.063 for
log (AUC), derived from a previous study assess-
ing the bioavailability of dexlansoprazole between
the 30 mg ODT and the 30 mg capsule [Takeda
Clinical Trial ID: TAK-390MR(OD)_102].
The sample size (n = 52) also provided at least
90% power for determining pharmacodynamic
equivalence between the two treatment regimens
regarding the percentage of time with pH > 4
over 24 hours if the true difference between cen-
tral values was no more than 5%. This power cal-
culation was based on the intrasubject variance
of 126 in the percentage of time with pH > 4
over 24 hours. These variances for pH were
observed in another prior study assessing the
pharmacodynamic response to the 30 mg dexlan-
soprazole ODT [Takeda Clinical Trial ID:
TAK-390MR(OD)_101].
Study design
Each treatment period in the two-period crosso-
ver design consisted of a 6-day confinement
period with the last dose in period 1 and the first
dose in period 2 separated by a 7-day washout
interval (Figure 1). Adverse events were moni-
tored through both treatment periods; ongoing or
emerging adverse events were further evaluated
5­10 days after the last dose of study drug with a
follow-up phone call.
Participants were randomized to one of two
sequence groups, alternating the order in which
Figure 1. Schematic of study design. Participants were confined to the clinic from day -1 to day 6. During each
5-day treatment period, participants received daily doses of 30-mg dexlansoprazole capsule or ODT. There
was a minimum 7-day washout period between the last dose in the first treatment period and the first dose of
the second treatment period. A follow-up phone call was made 5 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug to
inquire of any ongoing adverse events, new adverse events, and concomitant medications taken since final dose.

they received either the dexlansoprazole 30 mg
ODT or dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsule once
daily for 5 days. Dexlansoprazole ODT was
administered on the tongue and participants were
instructed to allow the tablet to completely disin-
tegrate before swallowing the granules without
chewing. No water was allowed with administra-
tion of the ODT. Dexlansoprazole capsules were
swallowed intact with water (240 ml) and partici-
pants were allowed to drink at any time except for
1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing. FDA
guidance recommends assessment of bioavailabil-
ity to be conducted under fasting conditions [US
Food and Drug Administration and Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, 2003]. Therefore,
both ODT and capsule were administered follow-
ing an overnight fast of 10 hours, and no food
was allowed for 4 hours postdose on days 1 and 5
when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
assessments were performed. No food was
allowed overnight and for 1 hour postdose on
days 2 through 4, when no pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic assessments were performed.
The FDA guidance also recommends conducting
the bioequivalence study with the highest mar-
keted dosage strength [US Food and Drug
Administration and Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, 2003]. The current study com-
pared the bioavailability of the 30 mg ODT with
the 30 mg capsule since the dexlansoprazole
ODT product is only manufactured in the 30 mg
dosage strength [Takeda Pharmaceuticals
America, Inc., 2016].
Sample collection
Blood samples (3 ml each) for determination of
plasma dexlansoprazole concentrations were
drawn into evacuated collection tubes containing
potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on
days 1 and 5 of each treatment period. Sample
collection times relative to time of dosing were
within 30 minutes predose, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose,
and were completed before any other assessments
were performed, if scheduled at the same time.
Dexlansoprazole is metabolized in part via the
polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19
enzyme system. Higher dexlansoprazole plasma
concentrations may be observed in participants
who are deficient in the CYP2C19 enzyme
[Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016].
Therefore, one 10 ml whole-blood sample for
CYP2C19 genotyping was collected before
dosing on day 1 of treatment period 1 from each
participant.
Plasma dexlansoprazole concentrations were
measured by a validated liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry assay at PPD, Inc.
(Middleton, WI, USA). The validated detection
limits for dexlansoprazole were from 2.00 ng/ml
to 2000 ng/ml, and values below this range were
considered to be zero for pharmacokinetic
analyses.
Intragastric pH recording for pharmacodynamic
analysis of dexlansoprazole was performed for
24 hours beginning immediately prior to study
drug administration on day 1 and day 5 of treat-
ment periods 1 and 2. A single-channel anti-
mony probe attached to a data recorder unit
manufactured by Sandhill Scientific, Inc.
(Highlands Ranch, CO, USA) was used for pH
recording. The unit was calibrated with standard
buffers (pH approximately 1 and 7) before each
use. On day -1 of period 1, the probe was
inserted into the stomach via the nares to a dis-
tance of approximately 10 cm past the lower
esophageal sphincter. This preparatory insertion
was to verify that insertion of the probe could be
tolerated and to obtain the length of the probe
insertion to be used on day 1 and day 5 of both
treatment periods. On days 1 and 5 of each treat-
ment period, the probe was inserted into the
stomach via the nares to the predetermined
length identified on day -1. To minimize the
discomfort of probe insertion, administration of
a topical anesthetic was permitted. Standard
clinical procedures were employed for this pro-
cedure, including permitting consumption of
water during the procedure. The continuous pH
recording session commenced immediately prior
to study drug administration. Intragastric pH
was sampled and recorded every 2 seconds
through the time of dosing until 24 hours post-
dose on days 1 and 5 of each period.
Endpoints
The primary endpoints in this study included the
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax
and AUC, and
pharmacodynamic parameters describing intra-
gastric pH during the 24-hour period postdose
(Table 1). Secondary endpoints included pharma-
cokinetic parameters used to measure the extent
to which a drug is active within systemic circula-
tion and pharmacodynamic parameters describing
the intragastric pH in 6-hour intervals (Table 1).

http://tag.sagepub.com 763
The time to reach Cmax
(Tmax
), terminal elimina-
tion half-life (T1/2
), apparent clearance after
extravascular administration (CL/F) and apparent
volume of distribution after extravascular admin-
istration (Vz/F) were secondary pharmacokinetic
endpoints; secondary pharmacodynamic end-
points consisted of the mean pH and percentage
of time with pH > 4 during the 6- to 24-hour
period following dose.
Treatment-emergent adverse events and overall
safety profiles of once daily doses of dexlanso-
prazole ODT and capsule were assessed using
safety variables that included physical examina-
tion findings, clinical laboratory testing, vital
sign measurements, and 12-lead electrocardio-
gram. Treatment-emergent adverse events were
defined as adverse events that began or wors-
ened during the period between receiving the
first dose of study drug and 30 days following
the last dose. Adverse events were classified as
serious if they were life-threatening, resulted in
death, required hospitalization or extension of
pre-existing hospitalization, led to incapacita-
tion, or necessitated intervention to prevent any
of the aforementioned situations.
Statistical analysis
All data analyses were generated using Statistical
Analysis System (SAS) Version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA). Pharmacokinetic parameters
were derived from plasma concentrations meas-
ured on days 1 and 5 of each treatment period
and were estimated using Phoenix WinNonlin
Version 6.3 software (Certara, Princeton, NJ,
USA). For each treatment regimen, descriptive
statistics for pharmacokinetic parameters were
generated for all evaluable participants. Actual
sampling times were used over scheduled sam-
pling times in all relevant computations.
Individual ratios of the two regimens for dexlan-
soprazole Cmax
and AUCs on the original scale
and the difference on the natural log scale were
summarized; geometric means were calculated
for dexlansoprazole Cmax
and AUCs. AUClast
(AUC from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable
concentration) was used to measure systemic
exposure after a single dose on day 1 and after
multiple doses on day 5 of each treatment period.
AUC
(AUC from time 0 to infinity) was used to
quantify the systemic exposure after a single dose
on day 1 of each treatment period only, whereas

interval) was only used to quantify exposure on
day 5 of each treatment period.
Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) models on
days 1 and 5, both pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-
dynamic parameters were analyzed with sequence,
treatment period, treatment regimen, cohort and
the interaction between period and cohort as fixed
factors, and the study participants nested within
sequence and cohort as a random factor. The
cohort effect was included in the ANOVA models
since participants were enrolled in multiple cohorts
for the crossover study. Cohort effect and the inter-
action between cohort and period were to be
excluded from the final model if they were found
not to be statistically significant. The effect of single
or multiple doses for each regimen was evaluated
using a paired t-test on Tmax
and natural log-trans-
formed Cmax
and AUCs performed within the
ANOVA framework described. The two treatment
regimens were considered bioequivalent if the 90%
CIs for Cmax
and AUC central value ratios were
within the bioequivalence range of 0.80­1.25 [US
Food and Drug Administration and Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, 2003].
Pharmacokinetic parameters from participants
who had data for both regimens were included in
the statistical analyses. Because of the crossover
study design, each participant received both regi-
mens and served as his or her own control;
CYP2C19 genotype was not expected to affect
pharmacodynamic assessment or determination
of bioavailability. No formal statistical analyses
were conducted, based on CYP2C19 genotype.
After dosing, pharmacodynamic parameters were
calculated for each formulation. The median
intragastric pH was determined over 15-minute
intervals from pH values collected every 2 sec-
onds. The 15-minute medians were used to
reduce the variability in pH measurements. The
mean pH was then calculated as the average of
these 15 minute-interval medians over the
24-hour period (primary endpoint) or over the
>6-hour to 24-hour interval (secondary end-
point) postdose. A second parameter measured
during these intervals was the percentage of time
with intragastric pH > 4 (defined as the percent-
age of the 15-minute median pH values that were
greater than 4). With consideration of relevant
measures of variance in the literature, pharmaco-
dynamic equivalence between the ODT and cap-
sule was declared if the 90% CIs for the difference
in percentage of time with pH > 4 between regi-
mens were contained within the prespecified
range of -12% to 12% [Hartmann et al. 1998;
Simon et al. 2003; Armstrong et al. 2007].
Results
Study population
There were 26 healthy adults in each treatment
arm enrolled in the study (Figure 1). Demographic
characteristics for those enrolled in each treat-
ment sequence were similar. There was an equal
distribution of men and women; most of the par-
ticipants were White (92%), and about half were
of Hispanic ethnicity (52%). None of the partici-
pants was a current smoker, and 23% of partici-
pants identified as current alcohol drinkers. The
mean age ± standard deviation was 40.1 ± 10.2
years for all participants. CYP2C19 genotyping
revealed that the majority of study participants
were homozygous extensive metabolizers (n = 27);
the remainders were heterozygous extensive
metabolizers (n = 6), ultra-rapid metabolizers
(n = 18), or a poor metabolizer (n = 1).
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetic parameter estimates follow-
ing a single administration of ODT or capsule for-
mulation of 30 mg dexlansoprazole are summarized
in Table 2. Values for Cmax
, T1/2
and CL/F on day
1 for the ODT and capsule formulations were sim-
ilar. The extent of drug exposure in the body,
measured by the AUC
, was also similar between
the two formulations, with mean day 1 AUC
val-
ues of 3048 ng·hr/ml and 3212 ng·hr/ml for the
ODT and capsule, respectively (Table 2).
Bioequivalence between the ODT and capsule was
demonstrated as the 90% CIs for Cmax
and AUC
fell within the 0.80­1.25 range (Table 3). The
absorption of dexlansoprazole occurred slightly
faster with the ODT than with the capsule, reach-
ing a maximum concentration in a median time of
4 hours and 5 hours, respectively. The mean Vz/F
for the ODT was greater than that observed for the
30 mg capsule (Table 2). Similar results were
observed for pharmacokinetic parameter estimates
and their corresponding statistical analyses after 5
daily doses of either ODT or capsule formulation
(data not shown). When day 1 and day 5 data were
compared, the 90% CIs for the pharmacokinetic
parameter estimates indicated no difference in
plasma exposure for single or daily dose

administrations of either the ODT or capsule. For
both formulations, peak concentration and sys-
temic exposure achieved after a single-dose admin-
istration on day 1 did not differ from those achieved
after 5 daily doses (Table 3).
Pharmacodynamics
The pH profile over a 24-hour time period after
participants had received daily doses of either
dexlansoprazole ODT or capsule for 5 days was
similar (Figure 2). The mean intragastric pH
after 5 daily doses of the dexlansoprazole ODT
was 3.7; the corresponding pH for the capsule
was 3.8 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table
S1). The percentage of time with intragastric
pH > 4 was 45.8% for the 24-hour postdose
time interval after 5 daily administrations of the
ODT, and 47.3% after the capsule (90% CI for
the difference: ­4.9, 2.2) (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, the ODT
and capsule maintained intragastric pH > 4 for

during the >6-hour to 24-hour postdose inter-
val, which included overnight hours (90% CI
for the difference: ­7.4, 0.4) (Supplementary
Table S1).
The pH profiles were similar between formula-
tions after a single dose of either dexlansoprazole
ODT or capsule on day 1 (data not shown). Both
ODT and capsule formulations showed better pH
control on day 5 versus day 1 with greater mean
pH and percentage of time with pH > 4 after 5
days of dosing. Acid control for both dosage
forms was similar on day 1 (data not shown).
Summary of adverse events
The majority of adverse events were classified as
mild in intensity (42 of 44 adverse events) and
considered unrelated to the study drug (31 of 44
adverse events). Treatment-emergent adverse
events were reported for 23% and 28% of study
participants receiving the 30 mg ODT and cap-
sule formulations, respectively. Of a total 23
adverse events, headache, constipation, erythema
and pruritus were the only events to occur in two
or more participants receiving the ODT formula-
tion. Headache and abdominal pain occurred in
two or more participants receiving the dexlanso-
prazole capsule. Headache was the most common
adverse event in both treatment regimens, occur-
ring in 5.8% and 6.0% of participants receiving
dexlansoprazole ODT and capsule, respectively.
Both erythema and pruritus occurred in 3.8%
and 2.0% of participants receiving the ODT and
capsule formulations, respectively. Events that
were deemed related to the study drug included
constipation, headache and pollakiuria, which
occurred in participants receiving the ODT, and
palpitations, constipation, abdominal pain, flatu-
lence, headache and dysgeusia, which were
observed among those receiving the dexlansopra-
zole capsule. One patient receiving the 30 mg
ODT during treatment period 1 discontinued

because of elevated creatine kinase levels observed
prior to receiving the 30 mg capsule at check-in of
treatment period 2. This patient's creatine kinase
levels subsequently resolved at time of discharge
from the study. No serious adverse events or
deaths were reported.
Discussion
This crossover study was designed to compare the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles
of dexlansoprazole ODT with those of the dex-
lansoprazole capsule formulation. Both products
are formulated with a dual delayed-release mech-
anism; they contain two types of enteric-coated
granules designed to release drug in a pH-depend-
ent manner. The dual delayed-release technology
is designed to provide an initial release of drug
1­2 hours following dosing, and a subsequent
release 4­5 hours after administration. The cap-
sule should be swallowed whole, which may prove
difficult for some patients.
Difficulty with swallowing has been reported in
almost 20% of patients in one survey, with 3% of
patients citing frequent difficulty with swallowing
[Cho et al. 2015]. Patients with frequent difficulty
swallowing were also significantly associated with
frequent heartburn and acid regurgitation [Cho
et al. 2015]. In general, patients who have diffi-
culty swallowing have been found to be less com-
pliant with their treatment regimens, and this lack
of adherence can potentially adversely affect
patient morbidity [Carnaby-Mann and Crary,
2005]. An ODT formulation represents a more
convenient mode of delivery to patients with dif-
ficulty swallowing, with improved ease of admin-
istration, reduced physiological stress, better
compliance and no increased risk of airway com-
promise [Carnaby-Mann and Crary, 2005;
Maalouf, 2013]. A study of the pill-swallowing
experience in adults found that 76% of partici-
pants preferred ODT delivery to a conventional
tablet, which some find difficult to swallow
[Carnaby-Mann and Crary, 2005].
Quantification of systemic drug exposure by
Cmax
and AUC values is used to determine the rela-
tive bioavailability of different formulations. Prior
investigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharma-
codynamics of the delayed-release dexlansoprazole
capsule have indicated that pharmacodynamic
effects, such as change in pH, are related to AUC
levels [Vakily et al. 2009]. Similar AUC levels
and comparable pharmacodynamic parameters
observed in this study indicate similar acid sup-
pression activity between the ODT and capsule
forms. The results presented here demonstrate
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equiva-
lence for the 30 mg dexlansoprazole ODT and
30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule. The determina-
tion of bioequivalence allows the 30 mg ODT to
be prescribed for the same indications for which
the 30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule is approved
[Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016].
Importantly, no difference in systemic exposure
between the two dosage forms was observed after a
single dose or after daily doses for 5 days. The
24-hour pH control was equivalent between each
formulation after a single dose or after daily doses
for 5 days. In addition, percentage of time with
intragastric pH > 4 was similar over the 24-hour
period following administration of either the ODT
or capsule, including during the >6-hour to
24-hour interval, a timespan covering nighttime
acid production over to the next morning. For
both ODT and capsule formulations, greater pH
control was observed on day 5 than on day 1; the
difference may be partly attributed to lower intra-
gastric pH values prior to the beginning of the
24-hour pH-monitoring period on day 1. The
cumulative inhibitory effect following multiple
daily dosing is anticipated due to the prolonged
binding of the active form of PPIs (sulfenamide)
[Vakily et al. 2009]. The majority of adverse events
were mild and considered unrelated to the study
drug; no serious adverse events were reported.
Both dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsule and 30 mg
ODT are approved for use in adults as a treat-
ment for heartburn associated with symptomatic
nonerosive GERD for 4 weeks, maintenance of
healed EE for up to 6 months and relief of heart-
burn [Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.,
2016]. The ODT formulation of dexlansopra-
zole was developed as a more convenient method
of delivery than those traditionally reserved for
patients with difficulty swallowing. Further
options that add to the dosing flexibility of the
ODT formulation include administering dex-
lansoprazole ODT granules orally via syringe or
via nasogastric tube after disintegration in water
(Kukulka et al., manuscript in preparation).
Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic profiles of dexlansoprazole 30 mg
ODT reported herein suggests that this novel
formulation may be used as a substitute for the
30 mg capsule, with added benefits of simpler
administration for patients who may have diffi-
culty swallowing.
