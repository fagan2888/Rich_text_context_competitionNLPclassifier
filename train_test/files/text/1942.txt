Abstract
Background: Previous cross-sectional study showed altruistic behaviors were harmful on major depression (MD). It is
needed to investigate the impact of altruistic behaviors by its contents on the development of MD prospectively.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) in 1995­1996
and the MIDUS Psychological Experience Follow-Up study in 1998 were analyzed (weighted N = 563). Financial support of 10
or more dollars per month had a significant impact on the development of MD in comparison to no financial support (OR:
2.64, 95% CI: 1.05­6.62). Unpaid assistance and providing emotional support were not significantly associated with the
development of MD in later life.
Conclusions/Significances: Those who provide financial contribution to individuals other than family members can be at
risk of developing MD.

Introduction
The estimated prevalence of depression was 9.6% in the United
States. This prevalence was the highest among 14 countries (6 less
developed and 8 developed) in the World Health Organization
World Mental Health Initiative [1]. The burden of depression in
the United States is estimated to be $43.7 billion [2]. By examining
risk and protective factors, it would be possible to determine what
types of behaviors are related to the development of depression.
One type of behavior to be examined are altruistic behaviors (AB),
which is defined as ``behavior intended to benefit another, even
when this risks possible sacrifice to the welfare of the actor'' [3].
According to positive psychology, AB can regulate people's
perception of those internal and external realities they are
powerless to change, and empower them to effect meaningful
change [4]. Literature on caregiving suggests that the caregiver,
who is considered as an actor of AB, might receive rewards due to
the perception of doing something good for others [5]. On the
other hand, the actor of AB might feel stressed when the sacrifice
of the actor is too large.
Previous studies reporting a link between AB and mental health
showed mixed directions. Schwartz et al. (2003) found that those
who do something for others showed better mental health.
Fujiwara (2007) reported that altruistic behavior had a tendency
to protect generalized anxiety disorder, but was harmful for major
depression (MD). However, these studies used cross-sectional
design. Brown et al reported more beneficial effects of providing
social support than receiving it by prospective study [6]; however,
as they measured the outcome as mortality, the impact on mental
health remains uncertain. In addition, the impacts of AB on
mental health depending on the types of AB were not well-
reported. In the study of AB towards children and grandchildren
by parents and grandparents, fathers and grandfathers who
provide moderate amounts of informal assistance and financial
support to children and grandchildren were protected to develop
MD in 2­3 years, although not among mothers and grandmothers
[7]. Thus, there is a need to investigate the impact of AB towards
others (i.e., non-family member) on the development of MD of AB
providers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of
AB toward others on the development of MD prospectively.
Methods
Participants
For baseline data, the author reanalyzed the publicly-available
National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS) data originally collected in 1995­1996 as a collabora-
tive, interdisciplinary investigation of the patterns, predictors, and
consequences of midlife development in the areas of physical
health, psychological well-being, and social functioning [8],
although the author was not involved in the original study.
Respondents were selected from a nationally representative,
random digit dial sample of non-institutionalized, English-
speaking adults, between 25 and 74 years of age, selected from
working telephone banks in the coterminous United States.
Detailed information regarding the MIDUS study has been
published previously [9]. The sample for the current analysis
includes original MIDUS respondents who completed both the
telephone survey (response rate 70 percent), which included
demographic characteristics and Composite International Diag-

nostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) based diagnoses of MD, as
well as the postal questionnaire (response rate 87 percent), which
captured information related to AB. The combined response rate
for both the telephone survey and the postal questionnaire was
60.8%. Follow-up data was obtained using the Psychological
Experiences Follow-Up Study implemented in 1998 [10]. The
primary objective of the follow-up study was to explore how adults
perceive psychological change in their lives. This study was a
random telephone follow-up of 724 respondents of the original
MIDUS random-digit-dial sample (82% response rate among 883
participants selected from the original MIDUS survey who were
re-contacted). After explaining the study to the informant, a
household listing was generated of people in the age range of 25 to
74, and a random respondent was selected. Men and older people
were oversampled. To see the impact of AB on the development of
MD in later life, respondents who had MD at baseline were
excluded from analysis sample, resulting in N = 639. In addition,
to adjust for possible selection bias and differential non-responses,
sampling weights were applied for all analysis yielding weighted
N = 563.
Assessment of Major Depression
MIDUS researchers assessed MD in both the original and follow-
up study using CIDI-SF [11]. The diagnosis of MD was based on
definitions and criteria specified in the DSM-III-R, comprised of 19
items [12]. A diagnosis of MD requires a period of at least two weeks
of either depressed mood or anhedonia most of the day, nearly every
day, and a series of at least four other associated symptoms typically
found to accompany depression, including problems with eating,
sleeping, energy, concentration, feelings of low self-worth, and
suicidal thoughts or actions. MD was assessed by telephone
interview in both the original and follow up surveys. In the original
MIDUS survey, the time frame for inquiring about MD symptoms
was the previous 12 months, while in the follow-up MIDUS survey,
MD items inquired about the past 5 years to capture all depressive
episodes during follow-up. The test-retest reliability and clinical
validity of CIDI-SF diagnoses have previously been examined and
found to be high [13]. Psychometric properties are also acceptable:
sensitivity was 0.73 and specificity was 0.82 in comparison with
semi-structured clinical diagnostic interview [14]. Moreover, the
MD scales employed in the present study were used in a previous
publication, where it was based upon the responses of the MIDUS
dataset [7,15,16].
Measurement of Altruistic Behaviors
AB was measured by mail-in questionnaire in three dimensions:
unpaid assistance, emotional support, and financial support.
Unpaid assistance was assessed by asking the following question:
``On average, about how many hours per month do you spend
providing unpaid assistance, such as help around the house,
transportation, or childcare, to anyone else other than family
members or close friends?'' Emotional support was assessed by the
following question: ``On average, about how many hours per month
do you spend giving informal emotional support, such as
comforting, listening to problems, or giving advice to anyone else
other than family members or close friends?'' For the question of
unpaid assistance and emotional support, respondents answered by
the number of hours. Financial support was measured by the
following question: ``On average, about how many dollars per
month do you or your family living with you contribute to any
individuals other than family members or close friends, including
people on the street asking for money? If you contribute food,
clothing or other goods, include their dollar value.'' Respondents
answered by the amount of dollars. AB measurements were further
categorized into three, non-AB, low AB, and high AB. First, those
who did not engage in AB were categorized as non-AB. Second,
those who provided AB were divided into two groups, low AB and
high AB. Cut-off of low and high AB was decided based on their
distributions. Consequently, unpaid assistance was categorized as 0,
1­2, and 3 or more hours/months; weighted distribution was
64.7%, 17.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Emotional support was
categorized as 0, 1­4 and 5 or more hours/month; weighted
distribution was 43.2%, 27.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Financial
support was divided into 0, 1­9 dollars and 10 and more dollars per
month; weighted distribution was 82.2%, 8.3%, 9.6%, respectively.
Measurement of potential confounders
Based on previous findings [7,15,17], age, sex, race, education,
working status, and marital status were considered as potential
confounders of the association between AB and MD. Age was
categorized as 25­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­64, and 65­74 years old
for further analysis. Race was categorized as Whites, Blacks, and
Others (Native American, Aleutian Islander/Eskimo, Asian,
Pacific Islanders, multiracial, or other). Education was categorized
into 4 groups: less than high school, graduated high school, some
college, and graduate college or more. Working status was
categorized as full-time working, retired, homemaker, and
unemployed. Marital status was categorized as married, separated,
divorced, widowed, and unmarried.

Statistical Analysis
First, association between AB and demographic variables were
examined by ordered logistic regression. Second, unadjusted and
adjusted odds ratio of AB at baseline on MD in follow-up were
calculated. In adjusted model, all AB measurements and
demographic variables were included as explanatory variables. It
is assumed that the association has an independent and significant
effect if P,0.05 (two-sided). All analyses were undertaken using
Stata SE, version 9 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).
Results
Demographic characteristics and prevalence of MD in 1998 of
the study sample were shown in Table 1. Regarding demographic
characteristics, 55 percent of the sample was women, 86 percent
white, 90 percent high school graduates or more, 63 percent full-
time workers, and 75 percent married. Among those who did not
have MD at baseline, in 1995­1996, 11.7% of them developed
MD in 1998 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.59%­14.8%).
Table 2 shows the weighted odds ratio of demographic
characteristics on AB. Higher education level was associated with
providing unpaid assistance and emotional support. High school
graduates, some college, college or more graduates were
significantly providing unpaid assistance in comparison with those
who did not graduate high school. Similarly, some college and
college or more graduates showed a higher likelihood of providing
emotional support, compared with those who did not graduate
high school. However, financial support was not associated with
education level. Older age groups were less likely to provide
unpaid assistance and emotional support; while no such
association was found for financial support. Race as other (Native
American, Aleutian Islander/Eskimo, Asian, Pacific Islander,
multiracial, or other) than white or black were 4.3 times more
likely to provide financial support compared with whites (95% CI:
1.86­9.86). Separated marital status were associated with higher
provision of financial support (odds ratio [OR]: 3.58, 95% CI:
1.28­10.0). Gender and working status were not associated with
any type of AB.
Table 3 describes weighted unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio
of AB on MD in 2­3 years later. Unpaid assistance, emotional
support, and financial support were not associated with MD in
unadjusted model. However, in adjusted model, financial support
were significantly associated with MD onset: those who provide 10
or more dollars/month to anyone else other than family member
or close friend were 2.6 times significantly more likely to develop
MD in 2­3 years (OR: 2.64. 95% CI: 1.05­6.62). Unpaid
assistance was not associated with MD onset in adjusted model:
although point estimate showed a protective direction. Emotional
support was not associated with MD onset either, although point
estimate showed harmful direction.
Discussion
The results of this analysis showed that the effect of AB on the
development of MD varied by type of AB. Financial support was
harmful in terms of MD development, while other ABs (i.e.,

unpaid assistance and emotional support) were not associated with
MD onset.
With regard to the harmful effect of financial support on MD
development, previous research also showed that giving beyond
one's own resources and feeling overwhelmed by others' demands
had a stronger negative relationship with mental health [17]. The
demand of financial support by others can be endless. Thus,
financial support providers might be easily overwhelmed by
constantly giving, and as a result, develop MD. Furthermore, the
timing of receiving something in return for providing financial
support may be delayed. That is, when people give some money to
others, they expect something in return not necessarily from the
receiver of the money, but some form of compensation for
exhibiting good behaviors (i.e. financial support to others), such as
reputation or status [18,19]. On the contrary, people providing
emotional support would receive rewards, such as sense of
meaning or purpose, directly through providing emotional
support, which reduces the likelihood of developing MD [20].
Thus, emotional support did not show significant negative effects
on the development of MD, as the providing emotional support
might be diluted by the rewards of contribution to improve others'
emotion.
In addition, financial supporters might feel guilty, as it is
suggested that the feeling of guilt promotes altruistic behavior [21].
Previous research also showed that the feeling of guilt, which is
associated with religious strain, would lead to MD development
[22]. That is, those who did not provide financial support don't
feel guilt for not providing financial support, while those who
provide financial support might feel guilt for not providing
financial support [23]. As the amount of financial support is
relative, those who feel guilt may not resolve their feeling of guilt
through financial support. As the feeling of guilt is associated with
negative emotions [24], financial support would have a harmful
effect on the development of MD.
Previous research has shown the positive effect of providing
financial support to children or grand children: for fathers or
grandfathers who provide financial support were less likely to develop
MD in later life [7]. The differential effect of providing financial
support to others and family members can be explained by changes to
the self-esteem. For fathers and grandfathers, they would think of

themselves as fulfilling the father's obligation when providing
financial support as they can provide the amount in which children
or grandchildren need. On the contrary, it would be difficult to
develop higher self-esteem through financial support to others, as the
amount can be unlimited and is relative, as mentioned above [25].
However, the current study did not measure the feeling of guilt or self-
esteem through AB among respondents. Further research looking at
the psychological mechanism of the effect of financial support on MD
is recommended.
In this research, 10 dollars was used as the cut-off of financial
support for better distribution for analysis. Although the amount of
10 dollars or more a month is a fairly small amount, it was found
that providing such a small amount had was associated with the
development of MD. The distribution of the amounts given by the
respondents among those who provide 10 dollar or more were: 10
dollar, 56.1%, 11­50 dollar, 33.3%, and 51 or more dollar (max:
100) were 10.6%. And, the percentage of developed MD in 2­3
years later were 21.6%, 18.2%, and 28.6%, respectively (Chi-
square test: p = 0.84, data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that
outliers drive the findings.
On the contrary, although not statistically significant, unpaid
assistance was in protective direction on MD onset. One possible
explanation for the mental health benefits of unpaid assistance could
be related to AB's nature of caring for others and focus outside of the
self, which might nullify the self-focused nature of depression.
Schwartz and Sendor proposed that the process of AB facilitates
changing of internal standards, values, or conceptualization of quality
of life [26]. However, previous studies showed limited evidence of the
effect of volunteer activity on prevention of MD [16]. The differential
effect on MD between unpaid assistance and volunteer activity might
be due to the difference of focus, whether outside the self or not;
people might join a volunteer activity from an achievement-oriented
egocentricity, rather than focusing outside the self.
The current research has several limitations. First, the sample
size was relatively small which might explain the marginal
significance level of the effect of unpaid assistance and emotional
support on MD. Further research using a larger representative
sample is needed to replicate the findings. Second, AB used in this
study was not validated in other studies. AB was measured
numerically by type of AB (i.e. hours or dollars spent per month);
however, whether the motivation of AB truly comes from an
intention to do something for others was not measured. Third, the
author could not adjust for all the possible covariates which
influence the onset of MD. For example, if the author could
include feeling of guilt or religious strain for doing AB as
covariates, the results may change. Fourth, the author could not
assess other types of AB, such as encouragement of others or giving
useful information. As specific types of AB were associated with
MD, it is needed to investigate the association between a wider
range of AB and MD. Fifth, it is not known whether AB was done
on demand or initiated by provider. If the AB was initiated by
provider, the provider might feel a sense of control, which has a
positive effect on mental health [27]. But if the AB was done on
demand, the provider might not feel a sense of control. Sixth, with
regard to outcome measures, it would be better to diagnose MD
using DSM-IV, which is currently used. In addition, other types of
mental disorders which are associated with psychological distress,
such as generalized anxiety and panic disorders, were not used in
the present study, as a follow-up to the MIDUS study measured
MD only. Nonetheless, this study has several strengths which
include being based on a nationally representative sample of
middle aged adults in the US, its longitudinal design, the exclusion
of those who have MD at baseline, and the use of a validated
clinical diagnostic tool (CIDI-SF).
The findings of the effects of AB on MD have implications for
mental health practice. First, randomized controlled trial to test
the protective effect of unpaid assistance on development of MD
needs to be implemented. In addition, the harmful effect of
providing emotional and financial support should be considered as
risk factors of MD in clinical and health care settings.
In conclusion, this study suggested the importance of AB on
MD development. It is found that providing unpaid assistance had
a protective effect on MD in 2­3 years later, while provision of
emotional and financial support had harmful effect on MD.
Further studies, including larger cohort studies or randomized
controlled trials, are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the
association between AB and MD.
