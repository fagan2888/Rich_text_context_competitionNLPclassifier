Introduction
Sleep disturbance and insomnia, which are prominent com-
plaints of cancer patients, have become a significant
problem.1,2 Up to 80% of patients with cancer will complain
of sleep disturbance during diagnosis, treatment, and as far
as 10 years into survivorship.3 Daytime sleepiness and sleep
disturbances have been reported to influence perceptions of
fatigue.3,4 A study on cancer survivors showed that 52%
reported sleeping difficulties and 58% reported cancer-
aggravated sleeping problems.5 Insomnia in cancer patients
is frequent and is severe enough to warrant treatment with
pharmacological and psychological therapy. Approximately
25% to 50% of patients with cancer-related insomnia are
treated with sedative-hypnotics drugs.6,7 However, cancer
patients often face several problems and limitations from
the pharmacological treatments, including dizziness, resid-
ual daytime sedation, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and
headache.8,9 The use of complementary and alternative
medicine is common among cancer patients.10 In particular,
clinical research has shown that acupuncture may provide

Abstract
Background. Insomnia is a prominent complaint of cancer patients that can significantly affect their quality of life and
symptoms related to sleep quality. Conventional drug approaches have a low rate of success in alleviating those suffering
insomnia. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in the management of cancer-related
insomnia. Methods. A total of 12 databases were searched from their inception through January 2016 without language
restriction. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were included if acupuncture was used as the sole
intervention or as an adjunct to another standard treatment for any cancer-related insomnia. The data extraction and
the risk of bias assessments were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Results. Of the 90 studies screened, 6 RCTs
were included. The risk of bias was generally unclear or low. Three RCTs showed equivalent effects on the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index and 2 RCTs showed the similar effects on response rate to those of conventional drugs at the end of
treatment. The other RCT showed acupuncture was better than hormone therapy in the numbers of hours slept each night
and number of times woken up each night. The 3 weeks of follow-up in 2 RCTs showed superior effects of acupuncture
compared with conventional drugs, and a meta-analysis showed significant effects of acupuncture. Two RCTs tested the
effects of acupuncture on cancer-related insomnia compared with sham acupuncture. One RCT showed favourable effects,
while the other trial failed to do so. Conclusion. There is a low level of evidence that acupuncture may be superior to sham
acupuncture, drugs or hormones therapy. However, the number of studies and effect size are small for clinical significance.
Further clinical trials are warranted.

clinical benefit in cancer patients compared with related
symptom control and supportive care.11 Acupuncture may
help treat specific cancer-related symptoms, including pain,
gastrointestinal side effects, hot flushes, fatigue, anxiety,
and depression.12-18
There are 3 systematic reviews related to the effects of
acupuncture on insomnia.18-20 One review yielded mixed
evidence,19 while the other Cochrane systematic review
showed that the acupuncture was not more effective than
routine care with noncancer-related insomnia patients.20 The
third review assessed the use of acupuncture in cancer care,
including the treatment of insomnia.18 That review showed
favourable effects of acupuncture on sleep quality from 3
trials with a high risk of bias. However, that review included
only studies in English, one included trial was not relevant
for insomnia21 and the studies are outdated. There has been
no current systematic review that evaluated the clinical evi-
dence of acupuncture for cancer-related insomnia specifi-
cally. The aims of this systematic review were to update,
complete, and critically evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture
in the management of cancer-related insomnia.
Methods
Study Registration
The protocol for this systematic review was registered in
the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(PROSPERO): CRD42015027385.22
Data Sources
The following databases were searched from inception
through January 2016: PubMed, EMBASE, AMED, the
Cochrane Library, 7 Korean medical databases (Korean
Studies Information, DBPIA, Oriental Medicine Advanced
Searching Integrated System, Research Information Service
System, KoreaMed, The Town Society of Science
Technology and the Korean National Assembly Library),
and 1 Chinese medical database (China National Knowledge
Infrastructure [CNKI]). The search terms included (acu-
puncture OR electro-acupuncture OR meridian) AND (can-
cer OR tumour OR neoplasms OR malignancy OR
carcinoma) AND (sleep disorder OR sleep disturbance OR
insomnia OR wakefulness OR waking) in Korean, Chinese,
and English. In addition, the reference lists of all of the
obtained studies were searched. Hard copies of all of the
articles were obtained and read in full.
Types of Studies
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were
included in this systematic review. RCTs were included if
acupuncture was used as the sole intervention or as an adjunct
to another standard treatment for any cancer-related insomnia
and if the control group received the same concomitant treat-
ments as the acupuncture group. We excluded case studies,
case series, qualitative studies, uncontrolled studies, and con-
trolled trials without randomization methods.
Types of Participants
Participants who were diagnosed with a sleep disorder due
to interior-stirring by cancer regardless of gender and age
were included.
Types of Intervention
We included studies that evaluated any type of invasive acu-
puncture. This included studies that used manual acupunc-
ture, electro-acupuncture and auricular (ear) acupuncture.
Trials testing other forms acupuncture, such as acupressure,
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, point injection,
laser irradiation, and cupping were excluded. Trials were
included if acupuncture was used as the sole intervention or
as an adjunct to another standard treatment for any insomnia
in patients with cancer and if the control group received the
same concomitant treatments as the acupuncture group.
Trials with designs that did not allow the effectiveness of
acupuncture to be evaluated (eg, by using a treatment of
unproven efficacy in the control group or by comparing 2
different forms of acupuncture) or included comparison
treatments/groups that were expected to have similar effects
to acupuncture or herbal medicines were excluded.
Types of Outcomes
Primary Outcomes
1. Response rate, defined as the proportion of partici-
pants who had significantly improved (judged by
primary studies' authors) based on parameters such
as prolonged total sleep time, improved sleep effi-
ciency or sleep quality, or symptom relief by the pri-
mary studies. These were subjective assessments of
overall effectiveness and were reported by the par-
ticipants themselves.
2. Scales or indices for sleep quality evaluation, for
example, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia
Scale (ASI), were assessed.
3. Sleep efficiency, which is the ratio of total sleep
time to time in bed, could be derived using either
subjective or objective approaches.
Secondary Outcomes
1. Sleep diary, measured by various subjective
approaches. Sleep diary generally has several items
for reflecting a subjective assessment of each night's
Choi et al 137
sleep, including time in bed at night, time woken up
in the morning, number of hours slept during the
night, number of awakenings, and total time awake
during the night, total time spent in bed, sleep effi-
ciency, and sleep quality or satisfaction.
2. Adverse effects, reported in the studies or measured
using validated scales.
Selection of Studies and Data Extraction
One author searched the database and screened potentially
eligible studies after reading the title and abstract of the
identified studies. After the initial screening, which
included checking titles and abstracts, a more thorough
investigation was performed using the full-text of each
article. All articles were read by 2 independent reviewers
(TYC and JIK) who extracted data according to pre-
defined criteria. Information such as the participants,
interventions, outcomes, and results were obtained from
each study. For the extraction of intervention-related
information, the revised STandards for Reporting
Interventions in Clinical Trials ofAcupuncture (STRICTA)
items were used to describe the details of the acupuncture
treatments used in the study context.23
Risk of Bias Assessment
Two authors (TYC and JIK) independently extracted the
data from the included trials. The Cochrane risk of bias
tool was used to assess the internal validity of each
study.24 The following characteristics were assessed: (1)
Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? (2)
Was the allocation adequately concealed? (3) Was knowl-
edge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented
during the study? (4) Were incomplete outcome data
adequately addressed? (5) Were the study reports free of
the suggestion of selective outcome reporting? (6) Was
the study free of other problems that could introduce a
risk of bias? This review used "L," "U," and "H" as keys
for these judgements, where "Low" (L) indicated a low
risk of bias, "Unclear" (U) indicated that the risk of bias
was uncertain, and "High" (H) indicated a high risk of
bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between
all of the authors.
Data Analysis
Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were
assessed for the effect size of each included study. All
statistical analyses were conducted using the Cochrane
Collaboration's software program, Review Manager
(RevMan), Version 5.3.0 for Windows (Copenhagen, The
Nordic Cochrane Center). For studies with insufficient infor-
mation, we contacted the primary authors to acquire and ver-
ify data when possible. Differences between the intervention
and control groups were assessed. For dichotomous data, we
present the treatment effect as relative risk with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we used the mean
difference (MD) with 95% CIs to measure the treatment
effect. In the case of outcome variables with different scales,
we used the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%
CIs. The chi-square test for heterogeneity and the I2 test were
used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the included studies,
where I2 values of 50% or more were considered to be indica-
tors of a substantial level of heterogeneity.25 The missing data
were not imputed from the outcome measures. When possi-
ble, we assessed publication bias using a funnel plot.
However, the small number of trials prevented the assess-
ment of publication bias.
Results
Description of Studies
Our searches generated 90 hits, and 6 RCTs met our inclu-
sion criteria (Figure 1). The key data from all of the
included articles are listed in Table 1.26-31 A total of 475
patients were included in the analyses. Sample sizes ranged
from 45 to 120. Three of the trials originated from China,28-30
1 RCT was from Sweden,31 1 study was from Denmark,26
and 1 trial was from the United States.27 The included
patients had various types and stages of cancer. The acu-
puncture style, number of sessions, and duration of treat-
ment varied across the included studies. Four of the trials
used manual acupuncture,26,28-30 and 2 trials used electro-
acupuncture.27,31 The major acupuncture points were GV20
(Baihui), HT7 (Shenmen), SP6 (Sanyinjiao), and PC6
(Neiguan) (Table 2). The total number of treatment ses-
sions ranged from 7 to 30. The backgrounds of the practi-
tioners were reported in 3 of the studies.26,27,31 The outcome
measures included an increase in the PSQI and a reduction
in symptoms (insomnia).
Risk of Bias
The details of the risk of bias (ROB) assessment in 6 RCTs
are provided in Figure 2. Four27-29,31 had a low ROB with
regard to adequate sequence generation, whereas 2 RCTs26,28
did not report the method. Only 3 RCTs26,27,29 had a low
ROB with respect to allocation concealment using sealed
envelopes. All trials not reported outcome assessor blind-
ing. Only 2 RCTs26,27 compared acupuncture with sham
acupuncture, and another 4 RCTs had a high ROB in par-
ticipant and personnel blinding because of the nature of the
treatment. All 6 RCTs had low ROBs with incomplete out-
come data. Only 1 trial27 had published protocols, and all
except 1 RCT was rated unclear in selective reporting of
outcomes. All trials reported the patients' baseline charac-
teristics, and all of the RCTs had a low ROB based on other
sources of bias.

Outcomes Measurements
Acupuncture Versus Sham Acupuncture.Two RCTs com-
pared the effects of acupuncture with sham acupuncture and
no-treatment or a wait-list group in breast cancer patients
(Table 3).26,27 One RCT that used a logbook for night sleep
disturbance26 showed favorable effects of acupuncture,
whereas the other RCT failed to show beneficial effects of
electro-acupuncture on sleep quality score based on PSQI.27
Acupuncture Versus Conventional Drug.Three RCTs com-
pared the effects of acupuncture to those of conventional
drugs based on PSQI and response rate (Table 3).28-30 Three
RCTs compared the effects of acupuncture on PSQI. One
RCT showed favorable effects of acupuncture on PSQI
after 1 week of treatment (7 daily times) compared with
conventional drugs,29 whereas the other study failed to do
so.28 The meta-analysis showed no significant difference
between acupuncture and drug therapy (n = 175, MD,
-0.04, 95% CI= -1.28 to 1.21, P = .95) with high heteroge-
neity (I2 = 73%, Figure 3A). Another RCT showed superior
effects of 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment on PSQI com-
pared with conventional drugs.30 The 3-week follow-up in 2
RCTs28,29 showed superior effects of acupuncture compared
with conventional drugs, and a meta-analysis also showed
significant effects of acupuncture (n = 175, MD, -1.67,
95% CI = -2.79 to -0.56, P = .003) with high heterogeneity
(I2 = 73%, Figure 3B).
Two RCTs tested the effect of acupuncture on response
rate. Two RCTs showed the equivalent effects of acupunc-
ture on the cancer-related insomnia response rate after 1
week of treatment. The meta-analysis also showed no sig-
nificant difference between the 2 groups (n =175, RR =
0.97; 95% CI = 0.88-1.06, P = .44, I2 = 0%, Figure 3C). One
RCT showed favorable effects of acupuncture on response
rate after 3-week follow-up,28 whereas the other RCT failed
to do so.29 The meta-analysis showed superior effects of
acupuncture on response rate compared with conventional

aDe-qi means acupuncture-evoked specific sensations such as soreness, numbness, heaviness, and distention at the site of needle placement, and these sensations may spread to other parts of the
body.
bAcupuncture method was classified into 3 categories on the basis of the levels of individualization: "fixed" means all patients receive the same treatment at all sessions, "partially individualized" means
using a fixed set of points to be combined with a set of points to be used flexibly, and "individualized" means each patient receives a unique and evolving diagnosis and treatment.

Acupuncture Versus Hormone Therapy.One RCT tested the
effects of acupuncture on cancer-related insomnia com-
pared with hormone therapy.31 That trial demonstrated a
significant improvement in the numbers of hours slept each
night and number of times woken up each night.
Adverse Events.Three RCTs investigated adverse events,
whereas other trials did not. One RCT reported mild or mod-

Discussion
Few rigorous trials have tested the effects of acupuncture
for managing cancer-related insomnia. The totality of the
evidence from acupuncture RCTs for managing cancer-
related insomnia is mixed according to the type of cancer
and the acupuncture and treatment regimens. Our review
suggested some possible positive or equivalent benefits of
acupuncture compared with conventional drug therapy or
hormone therapy. Compared with sham acupuncture, one
trial showed specific effects of acupuncture, whereas
another trial failed to do so. The level of evidence was low
in general. Furthermore, the number of trials and total

sample size included in our analysis were not sufficient to
draw firm conclusions.
Our review has several important limitations. First, our
study cannot avoid publication bias or location bias. The
distorting effects of these biases on systematic reviews are
well documented.32,33 Second, we searched a large number
of databases without publication language restrictions. We
are confident that our search strategies located all relevant
data, although some degree of uncertainty remains. Half of
the included RCTs were from China, and the generalization
of the results to other countries might be limited. Further
limitations include the paucity and the often suboptimal
methodological quality of the primary data. Finally, the
nature of all reported outcome are subjective measures and
these prone to be potential bias of measurement. In total,
these facts considerably limit the conclusiveness of this sys-
tematic review.
Compared with a previous review,18 we identified 4 new
RCTs26-29 and successfully updated the evidence. The previ-
ous review reported positive outcomes of included trials
with concern about a high risk of bias. The newly added
trials suggest more positive effects of acupuncture on can-
cer-related insomnia than the previous review. The results
of systematic review of acupuncture for cancer-related
insomnia are different from those of noncancer-related
insomnia. Two previous systematic reviews for noncancer-
related insomnia showed mixed effects according to type of
acupuncture and control groups, including high risk of bias
studies.19,20 Our review showed that the effects of acupunc-
ture are equivalent with conventional drugs at the end of
treatment, but superior effects at 3 weeks'follow-up in both
PSQI and response rate.28,29 This might suggest that the
effects of acupuncture are sustainable, while the effects of
conventional drugs decline immediately after treatment.
Then acupuncture could obtain a better outcome during
treatment follow-up than immediately after treatment com-
pared with conventional drug therapies.
Most of the included studies had an unclear or low risk
of bias across the domains. Two RCTs did not report the
random sequence generation methods.26,30 Only 3 used
allocation concealment,26,27,29 and only 2 employed patient
blinding.26,27 Because of the nature of the intervention,
practitioner blinding cannot be achieved. Trials with inad-
equate blinding or inadequate allocation concealment may
be subject to selection bias and would therefore be likely
to generate exaggerated treatment effects. Failure to fol-
low reporting guidelines, including the CONSORT
(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)34 or
STRICTA guidelines23 prevented the reader from properly
evaluating the trials. Collective efforts for increasing
adherence to the CONSORT statement and STRICTA
guidelines during the design, implementation, and report-
ing of clinical trials are needed to improve the complete-
ness of reporting in acupuncture RCTs.
Two sham acupuncture methods were used for testing
the efficacy of acupuncture for cancer-related insomnia,
including superficial penetrating needles at nonacupuncture
points and nonpenetrating needles at nonacupuncture
points. One trial showed favorable effects of manual acu-
puncture compared with penetrating needling at nonacu-
puncture points for cancer-related insomnia,26 but another
trial failed to show superior effects of electro-acupuncture
compared with the use of nonpenetrating needles at nonacu-
puncture points.27 This finding may suggest the possibility
of noninertness of sham acupuncture, which is different
from placebo effects of conventional drugs. However, the
superiority of acupuncture compared with conventional
drugs allows the possible interpretation of specific effects
of acupuncture for this condition.
There are several possible interpretations of the results
of this systematic review. The treatment might not have
been administered optimally in the included trials. The
studies may have been inadequately designed or the acu-
puncture treatments might exhibit nonspecific effects. For
instance, the number of treatment sessions could have
been too small to generate a significant effect, treatment
could have been suboptimal, or the protocol applied in the
acupuncture group might not have been suitable for treat-
ing cancer-related insomnia. In the included trials, the
effects were more positive in the trials with more frequent
treatment times (total or time duration).30 There was also
the possibility of revealing the effects of acupuncture in the
follow-up stages than in the final treatment.28,29 Both the
optimum dose and the ideal time or type of acupuncture
for various cancer patients are currently unknown. No
clinical trials investigating dosages and treatment regi-
mens have yet been published.
There are also other issues regarding the use of acupunc-
ture for cancer-related insomnia that should be discussed
further. Because cancer-related insomnia may develop in
the setting of a highly heterogeneous cancer with a different
etiology and severity, acupuncture is likely to have different
effects on different subgroups of patients. Therefore, future
clinical trials should be focused on a particular subgroup
and should include a very large sample size to delineate the
effects of acupuncture on patients with different cancer
types. Some of the included RCTs showed equivalent or
superior effects of acupuncture compared with conven-
tional drugs or hormone therapy.28-31 The effect size of the
included trials was not large enough to be clinically mean-
ingful. The treatment duration of the included trials might
not have been sufficiently long to demonstrate complete
effects on sleep quality improvement because although acu-
puncture is effective, the effects can be quite slow to
develop. If the treatment period is sufficient, it is possible to
obtain different results.
Although acupuncture in general appears to be safe, one
important question is the safety of acupuncture for cancer
Choi et al 145
patients. Adverse events were noted in three of the included
trials but they were negligible compared with drug-related
adverse events.26,29,31 Further studies (prospective and retro-
spective) on the safety of acupuncture for cancer patients
are required.
One could question the minimum clinical trial guide for
future research in this area. Future acupuncture RCTs on
cancer-related insomnia should adhere to accepted stan-
dards of trial methodology. Trials should have sufficiently
large study populations based on power calculations from
appropriate pilot studies and should also perform the fol-
lowing actions: consider the optimal doses, including inter-
vention duration and frequency; describe all aspects of the
methodology in full detail to ensure reproducibility; use
validated primary outcome measures, including subjective
and objective outcome (actigraphy or polysomnography);
and employ adequate statistical tests. Trials should also
evaluate the quality of sleep and the effects on quality of life
and should also report the number of participants who with-
draw from the intervention in each arm and their reasons for
doing so.
In conclusion, the current trials showed that acupuncture
may be superior to sham acupuncture, conventional drug
therapy and hormone therapy for the management of can-
cer-related insomnia. However, the level of evidence is low,
the small effect size reduces clinical significance and the
small number of rigorous studies prevents us from drawing
firm conclusions. Future well-conducted RCTs are needed
to determine whether acupuncture can be a viable option for
the treatment of cancer-related insomnia.
