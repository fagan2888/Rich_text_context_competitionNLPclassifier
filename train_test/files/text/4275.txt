A Natural History of the Drag Queen
Phenomenon
Michael Moncrieff1 and Pierre Lienard1
Abstract
The drag queen cultural phenomenon has been described at length. However, the depiction of outlandish and hyperbolic
womanhood and taunting and formidable behavior at the core of drag queens' public persona has still to be fully accounted for.
We argue that these aspects of the drag queen's public appearance could best be understood in a signaling framework. Publicly
donning extravagant woman's costumes attracts harassment and brings financial, mating, and opportunity costs, generating the
conditions for the transmission of honest signals. By successfully withstanding those odds, drag queen impersonators signal
strategic qualities to members of the gay community. Data collected among gay and straight participants support a costly signaling
reading of the drag queen cultural phenomenon. Participants generally agree that successful drag queens typically incur costs,
while gaining specific social benefits.

The drag queen phenomenon has drawn much attention over
the past decades (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz,
Belgrave, & Halberstein, 2007; Hopkins, 2004; Newton,
1972; Rupp, Taylor, & Shapiro, 2010; Sagarin, 1969; Schacht,
2000, 2002; Schacht & Underwood, 2004; Taylor & Rupp,
2004; Tewksbury, 1993, 1994). Much of the research has
focused on identity-based and sociopolitical motivations to
perform in drag, such as critique of traditional gender roles
(Brubach & O'Brien, 1999; Garber, 1997; Rupp & Taylor,
2003), and queer political militancy (Feinberg, 1996; Mun
~oz,
1999; Schacht, 2000; Taylor, Rupp, & Gamson, 2005). We
propose an additional, and potentially alternative, signaling
account of the phenomenon's characteristic traits of hyperbolic
depiction of womanhood and formidable and exaggerated
behavioral expressions (Berkowitz et al., 2007; Friedman &
Jones, 2011; Schacht, 2002; Taylor & Rupp, 2004).
In a landmark publication on the life of drag queens, Newton
(1972) emphasized the conspicuous, confrontational, territor-
ial, and effeminate behavior of drag queens and the discrimi-
nation, harassment, and stigmatization that impersonators
regularly had to face from both gay community members and
outsiders. Most people, including the impersonators them-
selves, seemed to view the drag queen attitude as extreme and
particular (Newton, 1972, p. 6). Despite this stigmatization,
participation in the drag subculture appeared to have afforded
jobless, young, and poor gays some opportunity to distinguish
themselves from lower status individuals such as hustlers or
"freaks," and, for the most successful drag queens, a chance to
develop celebrity-like status and social might in the gay com-
munity (Newton, 1972, p. 6).
Signaling theory has provided a theoretical framework for
better explaining evolutionarily puzzling human behaviors
(Bird, Smith, & Bird, 2001; Sosis & Bressler, 2003). We pro-
pose to analyze the phenomenon of drag queen behavior in
light of signaling theory. Despite the costs involved in publicly
endorsing a drag queen persona, marginalized individuals might
find it attractive, given the benefits they stand to gain such as an
enhanced reputation and increased social capital (e.g., Newton,
1972; Hopkins, 2004). The drag queen phenomenon provides an
interesting case study where particular behavioral signals
enhance individuals' reputation and welfare, while being
entirely decoupled from any reproductive payoff. The phenom-
enon can be understood as the partial output of universal

Typical organizational features of the gay community also play
a role in the emergence of the drag queen cultural practice.
Background
The Drag Queen Social World
Drag queens, or female impersonators, differ from transsexuals
and individuals with transvestic fetishisms1 in that they are gay
individuals who don female clothing with the explicit goal of
performing in front of audiences (Schacht, 2000). The focus of
our discussion is on the behavior of male impersonating female2
rather than its opposite, female impersonating male, known as
drag kings, which are part of a recent phenomenon with specific
features and rationale that differ from its male counterpart (Rupp
et al., 2010). Cross-gender impersonators in the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community are predomi-
nantly male (Rupp et al., 2010). Drag queens explicitly distance
themselves from individuals who use either hormones or
undergo gender reassignment surgery. These individuals are
considered as not "playing fair" and are banned from participat-
ing in drag queen competitions (Berkowitz et al., 2007; Hopkins,
2004; Schacht, 2002; Taylor & Rupp, 2004).
Individuals who endorse a drag queen public persona are
generally in their late teens to 40s, with an average age in the
late 20s (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al., 2007;
Tewksbury, 1993). The available research, based on small sam-
ple sizes, indicates that most female impersonators have
achieved a low educational level, and their earnings are at the
lower end of the income distribution (Berkowitz & Belgrave,
2010; Newton, 1972). Female impersonators' subdued demea-
nor when not in costume has often been noted in ethnographies
of the drag queen scene (Friedman & Jones, 2011; Stru
¨bel-
Scheiner, 2011; Tewksbury, 1993). They have also been
described as "not of the prescribed standard of gay beauty"
(Stru
¨bel-Scheiner, 2011, p. 12). The main reasons mentioned
in the literature for becoming a drag queen include the desire of
raising one's social standing, getting more involved in the gay
community, and starting a career in entertainment (Hopkins,
2004; Taylor & Rupp, 2004; Tewksbury, 1993, 1994).
Drag queens don their costumes primarily to perform at gay
bars, nightclubs, and organized competitions (Berkowitz et al.,
2007; Schacht, 2002). Their apparel is not intended to depict
ordinary female attires like that of transgender women but
portray purposefully outlandish, often vulgar, and exaggerated
stereotypes of womanhood (Harris, 1995; Tewksbury, 1994).
Theatrics, choreographed dance, and lip-syncing to short
popular musical numbers are part of club and bar shows
(Berkowitz et al., 2007; Schacht, 2002). Performers earn some
income thanks to spectators' tips. Only the most successful
drag queens can generate enough money to fully support their
livelihood (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al.,
2007; Hopkins, 2004; Newton, 1972; Schacht, 2002). Female
impersonators progressively build reputation and, for some,
local fame, through patronizing and performing at bars and
nightclubs (Hopkins, 2004; Tewksbury, 1994). Outside of
cabaret performances, the public wearing of drag queen attire
is usually restricted to gay festivals or exceptional events (Taylor
& Rupp, 2004). Of note, however, at the beginning of the fight
for gay rights in the 1960s, many less successful drag queens
(aka street drags) would parade ostentatiously adorned through
the streets, often attracting the ire of passersby (Newton, 1972).
The literature depicts a typical portrait of a successful drag
queen's public persona made of playful rudeness (Friedman &
Jones, 2011), obnoxiousness (Taylor & Rupp, 2004), and
unkind critical spirit (Friedman & Jones, 2011). Drag queen
role-play typically involves aggressive teasing and mocking of
audiences (Berkowitz et al., 2007; Schacht, 2002; Taylor &
Rupp, 2004). Boisterous displays comprising "flesh flashing"
and focus on the male­female duality of the drag queen persona
are core components of public performances (Harris, 1995;
Rupp et al., 2010; Schacht, 2002; Taylor & Rupp, 2004).
Female impersonators aggressively joke about their masculi-
nity, at times calling attention to their tucked away penis,
emphatically affirming that they are "chicks with dicks"
(Berkowitz et al., 2007; Rupp et al., 2010; Taylor & Rupp,
2004). Their sustained involvement in public confrontations
has led to the characterizations of drag queens as militants,
warriors, and urban street fighters (Duberman, 2013; Feinberg,
1996; Harris, 1995; Schacht & Underwood, 2004).
Individuals wishing to become recognized female imperso-
nators face many burdens. The financial expenses are signifi-
cant. Costumes and makeup worth hundreds of dollars require
sustained investments, seldom offset by the earnings from com-
petitions or audience members' tips (Hopkins, 2004). Oppor-
tunity costs are also high: successful performance depends on
extensive rehearsal and sustained investments in self-
promotion (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Hopkins, 2004;
Schacht, 2002). Ethnographic accounts support the idea that
these investments compete with maintaining more personal
relationships, which probably explains why female impersona-
tors appear to face difficulty establishing enduring romantic
relationships (Berkowitz et al., 2007). Furthermore, costumes
and makeup constitute potent sexual turnoffs, cutting off drag
queens from the available mate pool when engaged in public
display of their persona (Harris, 1995). They also face
increased risk of being harassed and discriminated against
given the heightened social visibility to which their trade
exposes them (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al.,
2007; Friedman & Jones, 2011; Hopkins, 2004; Newton, 1972).
Among the people who attempt to join the drag queen com-
munity, few become great successes. Amateurs have limited
status recognition and are exposed to stinging criticism, mock-
ery, and gossip of their gay audiences (Berkowitz & Belgrave,
2010; Schacht, 2002). Beginners face wholesale ridicule for
their unrefined appearance and behavior (Hopkins, 2004).
Scrutiny from other drag queens is intense and competition for
recognition between impersonators is great (Berkowitz &
Belgrave, 2010; Friedman & Jones, 2011; Hopkins, 2004).
Few paid professional opportunities are available at gay
establishments, intensifying rivalry (Hopkins, 2004). In some
2 Evolutionary Psychology
communities, the intense competition facilitates the emergence
of "drag families," with seniors controlling and mentoring
cadets (Hopkins, 2004). These families do help in reducing the
costs of entry for beginners. However, impersonators who have
support of such families generally do not garner as much
respect as those who succeed independently (Hopkins, 2004).
Contrasted with the intense pressure placed on amateurs,
successful impersonators end up commanding some authority
in the gay community (Berkowitz & Belgrave, 2010; Berko-
witz et al., 2007; Hopkins, 2004). Since many drag queens
begin with a low social endowment and status, gains in social
capital in the gay community can be significant. They can
eventually earn greater respect, becoming role models for up-
and-coming queens, and might be sought after to animate social
events and parties (Berkowitz et al., 2007; Hopkins, 2004).
Such successful drag queens can make enough money from
club bookings to support a full-time career (Berkowitz &
Belgrave, 2010). These social and economic incentives make
becoming a drag queen an attractive venture for at-first-
marginalized low-status individuals in the gay community,
who may not have easier alternate opportunities to gain social
acceptance and recognition.
Emergence of the Modern-Day Social Phenomenon
Early descriptions in existing literary sources placed the first
manifestations of drag queens, akin to their modern-day instan-
tiations, in England of the early 1700s (Norton, 2016). At the
time, gay sexual activities were illegal, systematically prose-
cuted, and could result in capital punishment. Performances
were strictly restricted to audiences of gay men in meeting
places called "molly houses" (Norton, 2016). Most of what is
known about these drag queens was discovered from raids on
molly houses and court proceedings (Norton, 2016).
The earliest appearances of gay female impersonators in
America recorded in the literature happened at masquerade
balls held in New York City in the early 20th century
(Chauncey, 1994). Such masquerades allowed individuals to
connect and to engage in same-sex courtship without being
directly exposed to social sanctions. In the early 1930s, there
were several recorded instances of "public disturbances"
involving female impersonators parading through the streets
of New York (Chauncey, 1994).
Out of the underground gay social networks of the early 20th
century, predominately gay neighborhoods progressively
emerged. Gay-only communities were well on their way to
consolidation by the 1960s (Harry & DeVall, 1978). Gay bars
in those neighborhoods became prime locations to find same-
sex romantic and sexual partners and to build social support
networks (Chauncey, 1994; Harry, 1974; Hooker, 1965). These
neighborhoods provided a certain level of safety for their res-
idents during the McCarthy era when gay people were purged
from government jobs, and gay establishments were subjected
to intense police surveillance and raiding (Loftin, 2007).
To avoid detection and the risks of harassment, job loss, or
arrest, gays publicly conformed to straight mannerisms.
"Swishes," feminine acting gays drawing attention from law
enforcement, were openly despised (Loftin, 2007). The risk
was aggravated for gender nonconformists such as female
impersonators (Arriola, 1995; Chauncey, 1994; Loftin, 2007).
It was during this postwar period that drag queens emerged as
significant players in the gay community (Arriola, 1995;
Hillman, 2011). In the 1960s, they became very visible during
the violence opposing police and gay communities in both San
Francisco and New York City (Arriola, 1995; Hillman, 2011).
It is noteworthy that many of the female impersonators who
became prominent in the 1950s and 1960s were from very poor
backgrounds (Hillman, 2011; Newton, 1972).
Cross-culturally, drag queens are now found in gay commu-
nities throughout the Western world. Interestingly, the phe-
nomenon has also appeared in regions where gay individuals
face important social or legal persecution such as in Moscow
(Kirk, 2015), Jerusalem (Middle East Eye, 2016), and parts of
Africa (The Independent, 1999). Other cross-cultural examples
such as the Khwaja Sira of Pakistan (Khan, 2014) or the Fa'a-
fafine of Samoa (Vasey & Bartlett, 2007) share some simila-
rities to the drag queen phenomenon (e.g., harassment,
ostracism, and hyperbolic displays of femininity). However,
those cultural manifestations have their respective specificities
that differentiate them from the modern-day Western drag
queen phenomenon. We focus solely on the latter.
Signaling Theory as an Explanatory
Framework for the Drag Queen
Phenomenon
Signaling theory has explained a wide variety of evolutionarily
puzzling and, in appearance, extravagant behavior in animal
species (Zahavi & Zahavi, 1999). The theory holds that in spe-
cific conditions, an extraordinary (i.e., apparently nonfunctional)
behavior that communicates information about the sender can
become evolutionarily stable if, on average, it conferred fitness
benefits to its sender (Maynard-Smith & Harper, 2003; Zahavi &
Zahavi, 1999). According to the handicap principal, such evo-
lutionarily stable signal must have a specific characteristic to be
reliable: it should be costly, rendering it hard to fake, a require-
ment if it is to be perceived as indubitable signal carrying honest
information about its sender (Zahavi, 1975, 1977).
All signals, as opposed to signs, are manipulative, being
designed to modify receivers' behavior (Dawkins & Krebs,
1978; Maynard-Smith & Harper, 2003). Signals therefore have
an intended audience (e.g., potential mates, cooperative allies,
and competitive adversaries). Whether or not a signal is effective
inmanipulatingthebehaviorofothersdependsonthesignalbeing
detected by its intended receivers and the latter's skepticism
toward the honesty of the signal (Soler, Batiste, & Cronk, 2014).
Humans use a host of costly signals to communicate honest
information about themselves. For example, Meriam males
signal their leadership and organizational abilities by leading
boat crews in quest for food sources in high variance in the
environment, such as sea turtles, instead of foraging, which
Moncrieff and Lienard 3
would be less risky while providing much greater caloric return
(Bird et al., 2001). By organizing such turtle hunts, Meriam
hunt leaders convey information about their abilities, skills, and
potentials to prospective mates or cooperative partners. Bene-
fits conferred to the signaler, such as increased mating oppor-
tunity or social and political influence, may pay off in increased
overall fitness (Bird et al., 2001). Other well-described
examples include, Ache men's signaling of cooperativeness
by sharing more food than they receive from others (Gurven,
Allen-Arave, Hill, & Hurtado, 2000), the purchasing of luxury
brands as a signal of wealth and status (Nelissen & Meijers,
2011), and costly prorelationship acts as signals of commitment
to romantic partners (Yamaguchi, Smith, & Ohtsubo, 2015).
Apparently irrational, extravagant, or risky behaviors, at
times, also might serve a signaling function when, for instance,
information about the quality of an agent is hard or costly to
acquire or to infer in noisy environments. In these circum-
stances, it might be beneficial for individuals to strategically
emit indubitable signals of their qualities to potential partners.
A risky behavior, given its inherent costs, might provide for an
adequate honest signal. As Fessler, Tiokhin, Holbrook,
Gervais, and Snyder (2014) have shown, deliberate risk-taking
increases perceptions of formidability, with men engaging in
such behavior typically perceived as larger, stronger, and more
violent than others. However, formidability is likely to be sig-
naled by more than just sheer strength and observable physical
attributes. Other factors such as cues of resoluteness and size of
social support also increase an agent's perceived formidability
(Fessler & Holbrook, 2013; Holbrook & Fessler, 2013).
Signaling one's formidability in particular social environ-
ments, such as those characterized by conflict and competition,
is likely to be beneficial for deterring potential adversaries and
for attracting potential allies. Gambetta (2009) found that pris-
oners often use deliberate self-harm to signal fierceness and
fearlessness in the highly constrained social environment of cor-
rectional facilities. Displays of self-harm are particularly com-
mon in prison environments with high inmate turnover and
unstable social hierarchies. Such signaling allows individuals
who are not naturally physically formidable to broadcast to large
audiences a disposition for fierceness approximating extreme
irrational impulsivity, hence affording them some protection
from aggression in the closed prison world. Martinez and
Lienard (2015) in a survey of study cases in the Human
Relations Area Files (eHRAF World Cultures, 2014) found that
institutionalized public displays of deliberate self-harm are
systematically associated with social environments character-
ized by low social mobility and competition between marked
and ranked social units. Participants are more likely to be young
adult males who lack access to other more ordinary status enhan-
cers, such as wealth, and human and social capitals.
The gay community has historically shared many of the char-
acteristics of social worlds where costly signaling can emerge. It
is a community that has been ostracized from mainstream soci-
ety and has responded by a self-imposed isolation to escape
persecutions. In some respects, the gay community constitutes
a protected social world with its own organization, rules of
courtship and socialization, behavioral norms, and an exacer-
bated mating and status competition (Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, &
Gladue, 1994; Chauncey, 1994; Kenrick, Keefe, Bryan, Barr, &
Brown, 1995).3 Youth, physical attractiveness, and potential for
uncommitted sex play an essential role in mate searching (Bailey
et al., 1994). An increased interest in younger partners correlates
with seekers' age (Kenrick et al., 1995). These mate preferences
probably contribute to the observed enhanced competition in the
gay mating market. Of note, the gay community has a high
prevalence of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, support-
ing the view of an intensely competitive mating landscape
(Kaminski, Chapman, Haynes, & Own, 2005; Russell & Keel,
2002; Siever, 1994; Tiggemann, Martins, & Kirkbride, 2007).
On average, gay men also prefer men who describe themselves
as masculine rather than feminine (Bailey, Kim, Hills, &
Linsenmeier, 1997), and feminine gay men regularly report dis-
crimination from other gay men (Taywaditep, 2001). The drag
queen phenomenon gains to be understood against such general
backdrop of mate preferences and highly competitive mating
market. The drag queen persona combines both the donning of
particular attires (i.e., strictly speaking, the handicap, which is,
the exaggerated feminine appearance) and a typical behavior
(i.e., the stance, assertive, and provocative). The antithesis,
namely, the association of aggressive provocation and exagger-
ated feminine markers, constitutes the entirety of the signaling.
As previously mentioned, beginner drag queens are younger
individuals often lacking more traditional status-enhancing
means such as attractiveness, education, and wealth (Berkowitz
& Belgrave, 2010; Newton, 1972; Stru
¨bel-Scheiner, 2011).
There is significant evidence that by donning their costumes and
makeup drag queens increase their risks of being exposed to
harassment and humiliation, violence or ostracism, loss of mat-
ing opportunities, and associated opportunity costs (Berkowitz
& Belgrave, 2010; Berkowitz et al., 2007; Hopkins, 2004;
Newton, 1972; Schacht, 2002). However, by engaging in daring
nonconformist practices, impersonators might at the very same
time achieve some recognition, as successful performances can
be perceived as public displays of one's claim to possess the
ability to take on any associated challenge. Impersonators com-
municate resoluteness and fearlessness, in brief, a type of social
formidability. In competitive environments, formidable
individuals are able to bargain for their own welfare and attract
coalitional allies more easily than less formidable agents (Sell,
Tooby, & Cosmides, 2009). For low-status entrepreneurial indi-
viduals, with little to lose, unwilling to accept the ranking
ascribed by some of their observable attributes, the potential
payoffs of risk-taking behaviors should be very attractive.
Thus, the hyperbolic and extravagant expressions of
womanhood characteristic of drag queen personas call atten-
tion to extraordinary behaviors and the associated costs that
come with it. Its typical confrontational attribute is a prominent
reminder of some type of formidability. The historical record of
drag queens' participation as lead figures during prominent
1960s countercultural riots supports the characteristic of pug-
nacity associated with a drag queen persona (Arriola, 1995;
Hillman, 2011). Portraits of drag queens as militant
4 Evolutionary Psychology
risk-takers are also readily documented in contemporary
accounts (Nichols, 2013; Paul, 2014).
In order to assess whether signaling theory is an appropriate
model for understanding the drag queen phenomenon, we need to
address four main questions: (1) Do people perceive the typical
features presented in the literature on the drag queen persona? (2)
Is the signaling dimension of the impersonation better perceived
by gays? (3) Are gays overall more knowledgeable about the
drag queen cultural practice? and (4) Are the costs involved in
impersonating understood? These questions have not been
explored in the literature yet. We relied on a survey measure
distributed to members of the gay community and of the general
public to explore these matters.
Method
Participants
We used two participant pools: (1) a sample of members of the
gay community recruited through online social media groups
and (2) a general population sample reached through Amazon's
Mechanical Turk® (MTurk). The University of Nevada Las
Vegas' institutional review board approved the research. Parti-
cipants were screened and excluded for incomplete survey
responses (n ¼ 55). Not being the target of this study, individ-
uals who perform as drag queens (n ¼ 11) were excluded from
the analysis. In order to maximize the differences between the
two samples of participants and to reduce the risk of potential
noise, bisexuals (n ¼ 24) were also excluded from our two
samples.
Oursamplefromthegaycommunitycomprised133men,98%
self-reported that they were only attracted to men (ages 18­74,
M ¼ 29.41, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 9.63). Individuals were
invited to participate through messages posted on gay social
group Facebook® pages such as I'm Gay and I love it, Gay Face-
book, and Gay California. These social groups were chosen as
recruitment sources because many of their members are currently
active within the gay community attending gay bars and night-
clubs on a regular basis. Furthermore, these online social groups
allowed us to sample gay individuals from a broad range of gay
communities throughout the United States. Membership of those
social groups ranged from 1,200 to 92,000. Participants were
entered into a drawing to win a US$50 gift card.
In order to compare the perceptions of gay individuals to
those of the general population, a second sample was recruited
from the Internet using MTurk website. The sample consisted
of 56 (50%) males and 56 (50%) females. MTurk is a website
where one posts tasks to be completed for a certain compensa-
tion. Participants recruited through MTurk are fairly represen-
tative of the U.S. population (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling,
2011). Recruitment was limited to the United States. Eight
participants who self-identified as gay and 16 that self-
identified as bisexual were removed from the sample, leaving
112 participants (ages 18­72, M ¼ 34.26, SD ¼ 12.31). Of
these participants, 50% reported being only attracted to females
and 49% reported being only attracted to males.
These participants were compensated US$0.40 for their
time. Individuals of the first and second samples had compa-
rable levels of education, with 71% and 62%, respectively,
having completed at least some postsecondary education. The
respective mean ages of 29 and 34 years indicate that the
majority of our participants were in prime years of mate seek-
ing and sexual (and, for some, reproductive) activities.
Materials: Perception of Drag Queens Survey
A great deal of the drag queen research has concentrated on
drag queens and their perceptions of the gay community (e.g.,
Taylor & Rupp, 2004) or on the interaction between gays and
drag queens (e.g., Berkowitz et al., 2007). One exception to this
is a recent study on hypermasculinity and drag queen stereo-
types (Bishop, Kiss, Morrison, Rushe, & Specht, 2014). We
expanded on the objectives of this research in investigating to a
greater extent gays' perception of drag queens. It should be
noted that we are not interested in the personal experience of
drag queens; rather, we focus on the communicative aspect of
their behavior. We are also not attempting to test a specific
model; instead we use an exploratory approach to show how
our framework can help make sense of aspects of the phenom-
enon previously described in the literature. For the purpose of
our research, we specifically designed a set of original survey
instruments. Participants evaluated 47 statements (see Table
A1) focused on five categories (Table 1).
Procedure
Participants were directed to the Qualtrics survey website after
clicking on the hyperlink at the bottom of the online advertise-
ment. They gave their consent to participate by checking a
radio button before accessing the survey. Participants were first
asked three free response questions:
(1) "Have you ever thought of performing in drag? If so,
what are some of the reasons for why you considered
performing?"
(2) "Why do you think most drag queens perform?"
(3) "What is your definition of a drag queen?"
Table 1. Foci of the 50 Questions.
1. The assessment of
the behavior
For example, "drag queens must be more
honest than others in the gay community"
2. The benefits and the
costs
For example, "individuals who perform in
drag face potential ridicule or insult from
straight people"
3. The physical and
social attributes
For example, "drag queens, not dressed in
drag, are likely to be more physically
attractive than the average individual in
their gay community"
4. The social world of
drag queens
For example, "there is a great deal of
competition between drag queens within
the drag community"
5. The drag queen
functions
For example, "drag queens are essential in
fighting for gay rights and equality"
Moncrieff and Lienard 5
In order to ensure that participants properly understood the
concept of drag queen, the following definition from the
Oxford dictionary (Drag queen, 2014) was provided immedi-
ately after they had answered the three previous questions: A
homosexual man who dresses as a woman especially to enter-
tain people.
Participants were then instructed to read the following
sentences: Take a moment to think about drag queens in
your community. What, do you think, are some of their
important traits? Please indicate how much you agree or
disagree with the following statements as they pertain to
drag queens. Participants evaluated a series of 43 statements
plotting their response on a 7-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). State-
ments included, for example, drag queens are more
trustworthy than others in the gay community, and drag
queens must be more blunt than others in the gay commu-
nity. By asking participants to respond in this manner, we
were looking for stereotypic responses. Stereotypes are cog-
nitive structures that can be useful in understanding how
individuals calibrate and adapt their behavior when interact-
ing with others (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990). Some questions
such as is there such a thing as a fake drag queen? allowed
for free response once the participant responded in the affir-
mative. In the present case, when the participant's answer
was positive, he was directed to a new screen where a short
answer question box appeared, asking the subject, what
would make a fake drag queen? Given that the participants
from our MTurk sample (i.e., general population) might not
have been familiar with the drag queen phenomenon, parti-
cipants were instructed to answer the questions to the best
of their knowledge. Following the survey questions, partici-
pants responded to more general questions about their invol-
vement in the gay community, such as how often they
attend gay nightclubs or bars, and additional general demo-
graphic information.
Results
Knowledge of the General Phenomenon
Given the heterogeneous covariance matrices between gay and
straight samples when examining the full set of variables, a
quadratic discriminant analysis was performed to determine
whether the items derived from the literature discriminated
between the responses of the gay and straight participants. The
reclassification of cases was highly successful: 98.33% of the
original grouped cases were correctly reclassified into their
original categories and 74.17% of cross-validated cases were
correctly classified (Table 2). These results indicate that the
gay sample has a response pattern that distinguishes them from
the straight sample participants. In addition, Mann­Whitney
U tests indicated that there were significant differences
between our straight and gay sample for 28 of the 43 variables
(65%; see Table 3).
Stereotypic Features of the Phenomenon
We wanted to examine whether participants in both our sam-
ples perceive the typical attributes of the drag queen persona
that is described in the literature. Items with the strongest
level of agreement (>70% agreement) after combining
responses (strongly agree to somewhat agree/strongly dis-
agree to somewhat disagree) within the gay and the straight
samples were selected for further analysis leaving 18 vari-
ables (Table 4).
Discriminant analysis determined which of these variables
best predicted membership in the straight or gay sample. Pre-
vious research found discriminant analysis to be robust when
analyzing skewed data (Sever, Lajovic, & Rajer, 2005). The
overall w2 test was significant, Wilks l ¼ .734, w2(18) ¼ 70.13,
R2 ¼ .516, p < . 001. Reclassification of cases based on the new
canonical variables was successful: 70% of the cases were
correctly reclassified into their original categories. Table 5
shows the independent variables, which are strongly associated
with discriminant function 1 (r > .3) and distinguish between
participants from our straight sample and gay sample. Items
that did not discriminate well between the two groups included:
Individuals who perform in drag face potential physical assault
from straight people (r ¼ .168), Individuals who perform in
drag face potential ridicule or insult from straight people (r ¼
.136), and Individuals while performing in drag sexually
arouse me (r ¼ À.048).
Participants in the gay sample appear to have greater
knowledge of certain aspects of the drag queen phenom-
enon. We wanted to further explore within the gay sample
what features are most clearly recognized. To determine the
number and nature of factors underlying the stereotypic
features of the drag queen impersonator in the gay sample,
a factor analysis was conducted on the 18 remaining items
from Table 4. Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin measure of sampling
adequacy was .69, above the recommended value of .6, and
Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant, w2 (120) ¼
1,000.12, p < .001, suggesting that the data were suitable
for analysis (Bartlett, 1954; Kaiser, 1974). Parallel analysis
(Horn, 1965; Cota, Longman, Holden, & Rekken, 1993) and
analysis of the scree plot suggested that a four-factor solu-
tion was optimal (see Figure B1 for scree plot). Polychoric,
as opposed to Pearson, correlations were used as the

variables. Using the polychoric correlation matrix, the ordi-
nal a for each of the four factors was calculated as .85, .91,
.81, and .65, respectively (Gadermann, Guhn, & Zumbo,
2012). Overall, the four factors accounted for 53.8% of the
variance. It should be noted that the purpose of our factor
analysis is exploratory. Factors 2 and 3 contain only two
loadings because of the limited number of items asking
about mating and aggression costs, and the a for factor 4
is less than .7, hence the results of our factor analysis should
be interpreted with caution.
Composite scores were created for each of the four fac-
tors, by computing grand means on the base of the means of
all items loading onto their respective factor. Review of the
factor loadings (Table 6) suggested that Component 1
showed a strong positive association with social eminence
and influence and was labeled social formidability (M ¼
5.41, SD ¼ 0.89). Component 2 had a positive association
with sexual attraction to drag queens and was labeled mat-
ing cost (M ¼ 1.79, SD ¼ 1.14). Component 3 was related
to potential social and physical harm that drag queens face
and was labeled risk of aggression (M ¼ 5.87, SD ¼ 0.99).
Component 4, showing an association with social invest-
ment and capital, was labeled social investment (M ¼
5.61, SD ¼ 0.72).
Discussion
Do People Perceive the Typical Features of the Drag
Queen Persona? Do Gays and Straights Understand the
Costs Involved in Female Impersonation?
Our findings support a communicative intent of drag queen
behavior. It appears that there are universally perceived aspects
of the signal, specifically related to the cost of the behavior.
The gay and straight population concur that drag queens are
generally less attractive as potential mates and exposed to
heightened risk of aggression. Thus, both the gay sample and
general population perceive some costs associated with becom-
ing a drag queen.
We do not have data on the rate at which drag queen
prospects fail. The drag queens on the base of whom people
elaborate their stereotypical understanding of the phenom-
enon are individuals still engaged in competing and addres-
sing the challenges they took on, that is, having some
amount of success in addressing the challenges their beha-
viors and attire raise. The severity of the costs, which
might involve such things as disrespect, hazing,

harassment, and loss of mate potential, will vary according
to the rank that the individual occupies from novice to
established and famous drag queen. One thing seems to
be essential though, for both our samples, having to with-
stand affronts and offenses is a core feature of the drag
queen phenomenon.
Gay nightclubs and bars are places for effectively broad-
casting traits and dispositions to large audience. However,
the cost involved in endorsing a drag queen persona seems
to be perceived widely, even by members of our nongay
sample much less likely to be directly exposed to drag
queens (among our straight sample 77% indicated they had
never been to a gay establishment). The signal is likely to
be received even more strongly by the gay community,
given what gay individuals know about the cost of expres-
sing publicly one's nonconformist sexual orientation. In the
late 1980s, up to 92% of gays and lesbians were targets of
verbal abuse or threats during their lifetime because of their
sexual orientation and 24% were victims of physical assault
(Herek, 1989). A more recent sample found that nearly 50%
had been verbally assaulted or abused (Herek, 2009). To
sum up, our data show that the cost of being a female
impersonator is the main factor about which most partici-
pants agree that it is a core part of adopting a drag queen
persona.
Is the Signaling Dimension of the Impersonation Better
Perceived by Gays?
While the general cost associated with being a drag queen is
perceived by both samples, the results of the quadratic discri-
minant analysis indicate that the response patterns of the two
samples are dissimilar, suggesting that our two pools of parti-
cipants have distinct knowledge of the phenomenon. Review of
the items with the highest level of agreement within the two
populations shows that only 9 items reached 70% agreement
within our straight sample, whereas 18 items exceeded 70%
agreement within our gay sample indicating that our gay parti-
cipants are much more likely to have a definite opinion than our
straight participants, suggesting that certain aspects of the sig-
nal may be intended more narrowly for a gay audience.
Discriminant analysis of the items with the highest level of
agreement within the two populations shows that items asso-
ciated with sociality and formidably (e.g., it is not wise to
upset a drag queen, successful drag queens are considered
to be local celebrities in the gay community, drag queens
typically have a greater social network than others in the gay
community) were the best items for discriminating between
the responses of our straight and gay participants. This lends
support to our claim that the gay community might be the
prime target of the drag queen signaling.

Are Gays Overall More Knowledgeable About the Drag
Queen Cultural Practice?
The underlying structure of the stereotypic features identified
by the factor analysis for our gay sample is consistent with a
costly signaling model. As previously described, the cost of
the behavior is clearly recognized among our gay participants.
Those participants typically insist that drag queens do not
constitute interesting potential mates hence, readily acknowl-
edge the mating costs. Undoubtedly, by donning their special
apparel and behaving outlandishly, female impersonators
remove themselves from the mate market precisely where
finding partners typically takes place, gay nightclubs and
bars. Furthermore, participants understand well that drag
queens increase their exposure to harassment and violence.
The withstanding of those costs allows for the honest actua-
lization of the sender's formidability.
Drag queens are also perceived to be socially formidable
and invested individuals with influence in the gay community.
Being a recognized and successful drag queen means being
willing to engage in aggressive behavior and endorse the role
of provocateur. Among our gay participants 73% agree that it is
not wise to upset a drag queen (only 5% disagreed). This state-
ment is also the most discriminant item between our gay and
straight participants. The involvement of drag queens in many
early confrontations between the gay community and police
forces, as well as contemporary accounts of female impersona-
tors' attitude at gay pride events, provides evidence of the role
expectation of provocation that comes with acting the part of a
drag queen (Arriola, 1995; Hillman, 2011; Nichols, 2013; Paul,
2014).
Note that the social might associated with formidability
is often imposed on others. Social agents would rather have
a formidable individual on their side than against them.
Interestingly, the results of a recent study suggest that gays
who score higher on a masculinity measure were more
likely to perceive negatively valence attributes, such as
melodramatic and emotional affectations, as more character-
istic of drag queens (Bishop et al., 2014). The scale used in
the study evaluating masculine traits included statements
such as I value power over other people and I don't mind
physical violence to defend what I have; the types of dis-
positions that strongly correlate with formidability. Bishop,
Kiss, Morrison, Rushe, and Specht (2014) suggest that
males who endorse a strong "masculine" ideal may hold
negative views of drag queens because they violate gender
norms that they hold dear. However, it is plausible that gay
individuals scoring high in masculinity perceive female
impersonators as rivals competing through different means
for status and social recognition.
Conclusion
The potential benefit of social upward mobility gained from
displaying specific forms of formidability seems to be a major
feature that makes the drag queen institution attractive to some.
The social ecology of the gay community resembles other
environments propitious to institutionalized displays of formid-
ability (Gambetta, 2009; Martinez & Lienard, 2015). In that
respect, it is noteworthy that the timing of the radicalization of
the phenomenon coincides with an era when the gay commu-
nity was once again under threat of violence and ostracism
from mainstream society.
A universal disposition for status seeking likely drives
the behavior of drag queens. Costly signaling allows for the
honest communication of information about the qualities of
the signaler, which eventually can lead to fitness gains. The
sexual behavior of gay individuals is typically decoupled
from reproductive fitness consequences. In this case, uni-
versal cognitive mechanisms motivate status- and partner-
seeking behavior regardless of any potential reproductive
fitness payoff.
The competition between drag queens signaling their for-
midability facilitates the emergence of a hierarchy. Drag fam-
ilies are the outcome of this self-organization of groups of
competitors. Drag mothers, or successful drag queens, at the
top of the hierarchy, benefit from their elevated social status.
Social influence, authority, status, and increased social capital
are gained the higher one climbs the ladder of success. The
most notable drag queens may also eventually gain greater
access to sexual partners, however, we currently lack the data
to ascertain that possibility.
Our research adds to the evidence that supports a costly
signaling account of the emergence of the drag queen phe-
nomenon. However, some limitations of our research will
have to be addressed in the future. We relied on online
sampling for collecting our data. While our samples appear
relatively diverse, they may not be representative enough of
the gay or straight population. Furthermore, our research
focus was on signal receivers rather than on the signalers
themselves. Data on drag queen demographics, benefits
obtained, and actual rate of violence to which they are
exposed (compared to other members of the gay commu-
nity) need to be collected to strengthen a costly signaling
account of the phenomenon. Further, experimental study of
the motivations for engaging in drag queen behavior is also
required.
Given the intriguing historical legacy of the drag queen
phenomenon, we may wonder what will be its future trajec-
tory? Our findings leave us with additional questions. As
acceptance of LGBTQ people from mainstream society
increases, thereby relaxing the costs of advertising one's sexual
orientation in public, will a drag queen persona no longer be
costly enough to allow social outliers to gain capital by adopt-
ing it? As costs continue to be reduced over time, will the drag
queen phenomenon be reinterpreted into simply a theatrical
vestige of the gay community's former conditions? The phe-
nomenon may indeed become more folkloric than functional. A
similar trajectory was followed by the pride parades: Although
gay pride parades were once serious platforms for demands of
political and social changes, they are now large inclusive fes-
tive parties.

Notes
1. Transvestic fetishism is a paraphilia that differs from drag queen
behavior in that it is characterized by sexual urges, fantasies, and
pleasures involved with cross-dressing. The behavior also tends to
lack the exaggerated displays of womanhood common among drag
queens. For more information, consult the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (American Psy-
chiatric Association, 2013).
2. For the purpose of our discussion, drag queen and female imper-
sonator will be used interchangeably throughout the text unless
otherwise noted.
3. Mating competition is heightened in the gay community. The mean
number of sexual partners for a 5-year period is 18 for gay/bisexual
and 5 for straight males (Laumann, 1994).
