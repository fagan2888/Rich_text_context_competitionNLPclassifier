Introduction
Events such as the Brisbane floods, the North American win-
ter storm (Groundhog Day Blizzard), and the Sendai earth-
quake and tsunami in early 2011 offer stark reminders of the
environmental and economic impact of large-scale natural
disasters on local communities within which many small-
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operate. Four consec-
utive nights of rioting in a number of major English cities
affected 48,000 businesses, the vast majority of which were
SMEs (Moore, 2011). Alongside seemingly more mundane
problems such as the loss of electricity, mains water supply,
telecommunications, and postal services, small businesses in
particular face threats to their business continuity that can
ultimately threaten their survival. This article focuses on the
information that could be used by managers during the pro-
cess of planning for serious disruptions. In particular, the
study examines the differences in the perceived usefulness of
11 specific information sources and the variations that exist
between SMEs with plans to respond to serious incidents and
interruptions (hereafter referred to as planning firms) and
those without such plans (non-planning firms).
The article provides a background to crisis management
and the paucity of germane research about SMEs in this con-
text. In particular, the vulnerability of SMEs to business
interruptions and factors relating to the low uptake of formal
planning in this context are considered to provide a context
for the study and to undergird the importance of such plan-
ning within broader SMEs' risk management planning and
resilience development. Following this, the article proceeds
to consider how learning for crisis is contextualized within
the broader organizational learning from crisis literature.
Having established the contextual and conceptual boundaries
of the study, the author formally articulates three research
questions and explains the research methodology used.
Following presentation of the data and discussion, the article
draws a number of conclusions that have important implica-
tions for SME owners wishing to adopt formal planning for
business interruptions, and for national and local policy mak-
ers, industry associations, and business support organiza-
tions and agencies (such as enterprise agencies, chambers of
commerce, and local enterprise partnerships) wishing to pro-
vide guidance and support that is deemed to be valuable and
useful by these end users.
Crisis Management and SMEs
Calling them "an inevitable and permanent feature of mod-
ern societies," Mitroff and Anagnos (2001, p. 1) suggest that
crises present leaders and managers with situations that

Information Value Distance and Crisis
Management Planning
Brahim Herbane1
Abstract
Organizational learning during and post-crisis is well established in the management literature but consideration of learning
for crisis and the sources of information perceived to be useful for crisis management planning have not previously been
examined. This study evaluates data from 215 U.K.-based small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) about the perceived
value of 11 sources of information between planning (i.e., firms with a crisis management plan) and non-planning respondents.
For planning firms, the information sources considered to be useful are exclusively experience-based, and when information
sources become less idiosyncratic and episodic, planning firms' evaluations of their value begin to approximate the ratings
given by non-planning firms. Furthermore, the concepts of relative value distance and value distance from threshold are original
features of this study and offer new ways to evaluate the value of information sources for organizations wishing to provide
information and support to improve business resilience and business continuity.

improvised. Crisis events are largely defined in terms of their
low probability of occurrence, high impact, and ambiguity
(Billings, Milburn, & Schaalman, 1980; Hermann, 1963;
Pearson & Clair, 1998; Weick, 1988). Potential crises may
emit warning signals that formal crisis management is
designed to understand and act on in the form of preventive
or defensive actions (Fink, 1986; Mitroff & Anagnos, 2001).
Organizations without such preparations to prevent or defend
are likely to have higher levels of disruption, damage, and
loss from the crisis and a longer period of recovery in the
post-crisis phase (Richardson, 1994; Smith, 1990; Turner,
1976). Here, we use the term crisis management planning to
refer to activities that may be formally implemented through
processes such as emergency planning (Crichton, Ramsay, &
Kelly, 2009; Ramsay, 1999), indecent management (Flin &
Arbuthnot, 2001; Njå & Rake, 2008), disaster management
(Larsson & Enander, 1997; Shaluf, Ahmadun, & Said, 2003),
or business continuity planning (Alesi, 2008; Lindstrom,
Samuelsson, & Hagerfors, 2010). Whichever of these
approaches is adopted, crisis management planning sets in
place predetermined plans and/or resources for the restora-
tion of processes in the event of an acute and unexpected
interruption or incident.1
In the context of the United Kingdom, small- and medium-
sized enterprises play a hugely significant economic role.
With over 4.86 million SMEs in the United Kingdom in 2013
(Department for Business Innovation and Skills, 2013), firms
with fewer than 249 employees account for 48.1% of private
sector turnover and 59.3% of private sector employment.
SMEs constitute 99.2% of all private enterprises in the
United Kingdom. In general operational terms, small firms
are more vulnerable to failure than larger corporate entities
with nearly one third failing within 3 years of start-up (DTI
Small Business Service, 2007). SMEs are particularly vul-
nerable to large-scale crisis events. For instance, over 450
businesses were affected by the Irish Republican Army's
bombing of Manchester's Arndale shopping center in 1996.
Within 6 months of the attack, 250 firms had ceased trading,
most of which were SMEs (Herbane, 2010). More recently,
Duncan, Yeager, Rucks, and Ginter (2011) have highlighted
the disproportionately high impact that natural and man-
made disasters in the United States have had on small- and
medium-sized firms, leading to their observation that given
the inevitability of a disaster striking, operational continuity
planning is essential for organizational survival.
There is evidence to support the assertion that small- and
medium-sized firms are more vulnerable to the effects of an
acute crisis. One series of influences on an organization's
vulnerability to crisis is the organizational components that
(Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992) present as a layered "onion"
model of crisis with an outer core of technology followed by
organizational structure and human factors to the inner layers
of organizational culture and top management psychology.
For SMEs, each of these components differ from larger firms
in terms of their usage, complexity, and redundancy (surplus
resources that can be marshaled for a crisis response). The
presence of resource redundancy is considered an important
precursor to higher resilience to crisis (Boin & Schulman,
2008; Crandall, Parnell, & Spillan, 2010) although Perrow
(1999) argues than redundancy occasionally serves to pre-
serve poorly designed systems in large firms that are vulner-
able to failure. There is support for the role of such plans in
significantly reducing recovery lead times (Fink, 1986) and
SME managers have been found to strongly associate crisis
management planning with increased business resilience
during a crisis (Herbane, 2010). Despite this, however, a
number of studies have found that SMEs are less likely to
undertake formal crisis management planning than large
firms and that a small proportion of SMEs have formal plans
to deal with business interruptions. Despite some method-
ological differences, a number of studies since 2003 have
highlighted these differentials in the presence of formalized
plans and processes to deal with business interruptions (see
Herbane, 2010; Woodman, 2006). Most recently, the study
by Woodman and Hutchings (2010) found that 29% of U.K.
SMEs have formal dedicated business continuity plans.
Furthermore, in the U.K. context, resulting from the Civil
Contingencies Act of 2004, there is a recognition of the vul-
nerability of, and support needed for, SMEs in the duties of
local authorities and other bodies in providing advice and
assistance about business continuity planning (Herbane,
2011, Cabinet Office, 2005, p. 2).
Organizational Learning From Crisis
Versus Organizational Learning for
Crisis
In the timeline of a crisis with pre-, trans-, and post-crisis
phases, this latter phase (at which point operational recovery
from the crisis has been achieved and the organization is able
to fulfill the majority of its pre-crisis contractual and com-
mercial obligations) is the locale for organizational learning
and process improvement (Karakasidis, 1997; Smith &
Elliott, 2007; Toft & Reynolds, 1997; Weick & Sutcliffe,
2003). The main focus is to learn from the precursors, gene-
sis, and manifestation of the crisis to identify opportunities to
improve the resilience of the firm to the reoccurrence of the
crisis, and to evaluate the preparations for, and responses to,
the crisis once it arose and the management team took the
formal decision to implement the crisis management plan.
Opportunities are also presented to learn about participants'
situational awareness and post-crisis stress (Paton, 2003).
Crises may act as triggers to crisis-induced learning
(Deverell, 2009), and learning can take place intra-crisis
through incident command structures rather than simply
inter- or post-crisis (Moynihan, 2009). Beyond the boundar-
ies of the organization that encountered the crisis, post-crisis
learning about crisis can take place through public inquiries
and accident investigations (Elliott, 2009; Elliott &
Herbane 3
McGuinness, 2002; Smith, 2007; Vaughan, 1997). Moreover,
crises may be characterized as "ill-structured messes" due to
the high interaction of problems within a complex system.
These traits mean that stakeholders differ in their under-
standing of the constituent problems of a crisis, making it
"inherently controversial" (Mitroff, Alpaslan, & Green,
2004, p. 175). Distinguishing between passive learning
(knowing) and active learning (knowing followed by correc-
tive action), Toft and Reynolds (1997) propose that crisis
preparedness is enhanced by transferring knowledge from
one setting to another where there are "strong isomorphic
similarities" (p. 55) because of similarities in behavioral pat-
terns. This isomorphic learning should promulgate changes
both to explicit plans/recovery processes and the assump-
tions held by actors about their ability to response to an inci-
dent. A consequence of this for SME owners is whether
information about the impact of incidents on SMEs may
form a type of "iconic" learning, which as Toft and Reynolds
(1997) put it "is a learning event in itself" (p. 550).
The propensity for organizations to be exposed to a crisis
has occupied a large amount of attention in the literature (La
Porte, 1996; La Porte & Rochlin, 1994; Perrow, 1984;
Reason, 1997; Rijpma, 2003; Shrivastava, Sonpar, &
Pazzaglia, 2009), within which studies have also examined
their resistance to change (Toft & Reynolds, 1997) and the
influence of information asymmetries in crisis prevention
(Fauchart, 2006) that are problematized when the crisis is
dispersed across locations and points in time--in other
words, the crisis is not a single "big-bang" incident taking
place in a single location. Roux-Dufort (2009) refers to crisis
proneness resulting from "an undercurrent accumulation of
organizational imperfections (anomalies, vulnerabilities [. .
.]) that lay a favourable ground for crises to occur" (p. 5)
coupled with management ignorance (deliberate or other-
wise) of these imperfections. This processual view of crisis,
Roux-Dufort suggests, highlights the importance of manag-
ers using knowledge of events to develop and enhance their
understanding of how vulnerabilities foment. His account
proposes that managers may fail to seek information and
support to understand and address organizational vulnerabil-
ity because of the cognitive dissonance that would arise from
reconciling "business-as-usual" with "risk of failure." This
failure fuels anomalies, then vulnerabilities, and subsequent
disruptions. Set within the context of Turner's disaster incu-
bation theory (Turner, 1978; Turner & Pidgeon, 1997),
Roux-Dufort (2009) further reinforces the failures of fore-
sight thesis and the critical role of maladaptive behaviors that
include political dysfunctions and cognitive impediments to
effective information collection and analysis. Limited cogni-
tion through rigid adherence to simple assumptions about the
organization and its environment has been associated with
crisis-prone organizations (Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992) and
crisis-prone managers who exhibit faulty assumptions due to
defense mechanisms and personality disorders (Mitroff &
Pauchant, 1990).
Smith and Elliott's (2007) meta-analysis of the organiza-
tional learning from crisis literature identified eight barriers
to learning: rigidity of core beliefs, values, and assumptions;
ineffective communication and information difficulties;
denial, centrality of expertise, and the disregard of outsiders;
peripheral inquiry and decoy phenomenon; cognitive nar-
rowing and fixation (reductionist); maladaptation, threat
minimization and environmental shifts; lack of corporate
responsibility; and a focus on single-loop learning. These
barriers are said to hinder the use of information in subse-
quent planning for crises and influence the degree of crisis
preparedness that the organization possesses. Synthesizing
organizational learning with a chronological view of crisis
(pre-, trans-, and post-crisis stages), a valuable distinction is
made between learning for crisis, learning as crisis, and
learning from crisis, respectively. Learning for crisis involves
pre-crisis scenario planning, modeling, and simulation in
order that managers can learn from past events (including
those affecting other organizations) to enhance their own
provisions for crisis recovery. This crisis phronsis--experi-
ence- and action-driven wisdom based on the experience of
crisis--is essential in the drive toward greater business resil-
ience and, ultimately, business survival.
A further reason why managers may choose not to seek
information from specific parties is informed by literature
focusing on risk perception. Assessments of risk are medi-
ated by the degree of trust placed in the source of information
and knowledge. Trust in the information has been found to
increase where experiential, judgmental, or practiced activi-
ties are concerned, and where different constituencies in the
production and use of knowledge share the same practices
(Lane, 2011, 2012). This signals the importance of how and
by whom the knowledge is produced and how this combina-
tion of reputational and experiential factors determines the
credibility of the source and managers' volition toward the
sources for support and guidance. Furthermore, Frewer,
Howard, Hedderley, and Shepherd (1998, p. 193) suggest
that trust about information "may as important a determinant
. . . as the content of the risk information," and the neutrality
of the source is essential in offsetting the potential for dis-
trust. Such literature cites disagreements between scientists,
governments, and the public about the environmental haz-
ards set against the benefits of retaining or introducing new
technologies. Within the context of the present study, trust
and assessments of risk may be influenced by disagreements
in the perceived value of the practices embedded within sup-
port and guidance. Not only is trust central to social capital
for public engagement (Kapserson, Golding, & Kasperson,
1999), thereby affecting the effectiveness and asymmetries
of risk communication, the fragility of trust reflects the rela-
tionships between parties (such as between information pro-
vider and receiver) and thus risk diagnosis and management
(Slovic, 1999).
While attention has been given to the meaning of the
experience of crisis through the process of "sense making"
4 SAGE Open
during the trans-crisis stage, and the roles of commitment,
capacity, and expectations in attenuating the crisis (Weick,
1988), little attention has been given to how and whether
organizations can learn about planning for serious disrup-
tions prior to their occurrence other than learning for crisis in
the form of the study of antecedents and simulation of the
crisis response. Given the lower levels of adoption of formal
crisis management planning in the form of business continu-
ity planning in SMEs (Pearson & Woodman, 2012) and the
deterrent effect of complex planning guidance (Duncan et
al., 2011) on its adoption, relatively little is known about
how they embark on the process of learning about an unfa-
miliar activity that is intended to guide an organization at the
time of its greatest potential vulnerability. As managers of
SMEs scan the information environment for sources, which
sources and information providers are used and perceived to
be useful, and what does this tell policy makers about SMEs
information and support needs as they start their processes of
learning for crisis prevention and recovery? Moreover, stud-
ies of organization learning from crises are firmly rooted in a
large firm perspective rather than the individual learning and
behavior processes (Kolb, 1984) of the owner manager as the
principal (and often only) strategic decision maker that pre-
vails in a small- and medium-sized enterprise context.
Information is a precursor to organizational learning and
planning processes, and can influence the bounded aware-
ness of decision makers (Bazerman & Chugh, 2006) and
paradigm blindness (Wheatley, 2006), yet little is known
about attitudes to sources of information about crisis man-
agement planning in SMEs. Accordingly, the study sets out
to address the following questions:
·
· What are the sources of information that the managers
of SMEs deem important for crisis management
planning?
·
· How do the perceptions of information sources differ
according to their source and nature?
·
· How do perceptions vary between SMEs with crisis
management planning in place and those without it?
Method
The data used in the study were collected through the use of
a postal questionnaire that was sent to a representative sam-
ple of 1,000 U.K. SMEs chosen randomly from the Bureau
van Dijk 2010 FAME database of 20,914 firms that meet the
definition of a small- or medium-sized firm according to the
European Commission. Recommendation 2003/361/EC
(European Commission, 2010) specifies a small firm as hav-
ing a turnover per annum/balance sheet total less than 10
million and less than 50 employees. A medium-sized firm
has a turnover per annum of no greater than 50 million, a
balance sheet total of not more than 43 million, and between
51and250employees(inaddition,theEuropeanCommission
defines a "micro" firm as having turnover/balance sheet
totals less than 2 million and less than 10 employees). Data
were collected as part of a wider study in U.K. SMEs
(Herbane, 2013) but the data are used and presented for the
first time in this study (i.e., there is no data overlap with other
published work).
The data were derived from a questionnaire that com-
prised of questions about the company's size, age, and the
presence of formal crisis management plans. Respondents
were asked to indicate the company's experience of seven
different crisis types based on Mitroff and Alpaslan (2003)
classification of crises (physical, personnel, external crimi-
nal, information, natural, economic, and reputational), which
in turn echoes a number of other classifications in the extant
(Burnett, 1998; Gundel, 2005; Mitroff, Pauchant, &
Shrivastava, 1988). The instrument was designed to elicit
ratings (using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from
strongly agree to strongly disagree) for a variety of sources
of information that were deemed to be useful to a manager
for crisis management planning. This study focuses on data
relating to the respondents' evaluations of the usefulness
(actual in the case of planning firms and potentially in the
case of non-planning firms) of the following 11 information
sources; businesses in the same economic sector, organiza-
tions outside the firm's sector, the media, local authorities,
colleagues within the business, central government, business
support agencies, important clients, industry associations,
legislation and regulations (including standards), and the
firm's experience of crisis.
The targeted respondent was the Managing Director of
the company, and each one was sent a personalized covering
letter to accompany the questionnaire and postage-paid
return envelope. The mailing resulted in 215 usable
responses, giving a response rate of 22.4% (in 42 of the
1,000 firms in the sample, the addressee had left the com-
pany). To examine for potential non-response bias, mean
scores for early and late responses were examined
(Armstrong & Overton, 1977) with resulting t-tests no sig-
nificant differences between early and late responders for
the variables used in this study. Furthermore, the response
rate is argued to be acceptable given that other seminal and
recent studies with similar methodological characteristics
such as senior managers as the target respondent (Hunt &
Chonko, 1987), sensitive subject matter (Mitroff et al.,
1988), and respondent organization and sample frame size
(Fraj-Andrés, Martinez-Salinas, & Matute-Vallejo, 2009;
Huurne & Gutteling, 2008). Respondent firms ranged in
size from 2 to 247 employees (M = 39.68, median = 28,
SD = 40.60) with a median firm age of 10 years (min = 2,
max = 160, M = 15.84, SD). Only 22% (n = 47) of respon-
dents indicated that they had a formal crisis management
plan with mean spending of £10,181 per annum on crisis
planning activities. Testing for non-response bias, the mea-
sures of company age, and the number of employees for a
random selection of 50 respondent and 50 non-respondent
firms were tested using the Independent Samples
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test with resulting p-values for age
and employees at .446 and .270, respectively (p > .05).

Results and Discussion
Contrasts Between Planning and Non-Planning
Firms
Table 1 presents respondents' ratings about the actual or
potential usefulness of 11information sources for crisis man-
agement planning. The independent-samples t-test was
employed to test for significant differences in the responses
of SMEs with crisis plans ("planning," n = 47) and SMEs
without crisis plans ("non-planning," n = 168). With the
exception of the media, the mean scores of the 10 remaining
information sources differed significantly at the .05 level.
The data show that planning and non-planning firms rank
experience-based information sources (colleagues, firm
experience of crisis, important clients, other firm's experi-
ence of crisis in their sector, other firm's experience of crisis
outside their sector) among the most important in terms of
their perceived usefulness for crisis management planning.
For planning firms, these experience sources constituted the
top five ranked information sources and for non-planning
firms, these sources occupied positions two to six in the rank
order, with the highest ranking taken by a generic external
source--the media. This similarity in ranking is, however,
moderated by the observation that none of the ratings for
information sources from non-planners rise above the mid-
way point of the Likert-type scale. Only the experience of
crisis and the media had scores that were higher than the
arithmetical midway point (2.5). Thus, while the rankings
suggest only minor differences between planning and non-
planning firms, the ratings given to each information source
reveal a lack of importance attached to all 11 information
sources by non-planning firms as opposed to 6 information
sources deemed to lack relative importance for planning
firms. The data suggest that the experience of crisis and
information from the general media are the most likely to be
inputs to crisis management planning for those current non-
adopters. The similarity in rank order also supports the prop-
osition that non-planning firms also consider experience to
be a potentially useful source of information; what differs is
that they currently attach a far lower importance to it than
their planning counterparts (rather than such sources appear-
ing at the lower end of the ranking order for non-planners).
Irrespective of the presence of a crisis management plan
or otherwise, organizations in the study attached a low level
of importance to information from government/public agen-
cies such as central government, local authorities (city and
county councils), and business support agencies such as with
these sources ranked as the three least important among both
types of firms. Moreover, even for planning firms, the rank-
ings were distant from the midpoint on the measurement
scale, making these sources by far the least important for
those SMEs that have undertaken the process of plan devel-
opment. This triumvirate of government/public information
sources is discernibly separated in importance to a mid-rank-
ing group of information sources that include the media,
industry associations, and legislation, regulations and stan-
dards. The ratings for these sources mark a transition to those
that are deemed useful by respondents in the study.
Industry-level influence is stronger in terms of the value of
operational information from other organizations in the sector
and organizations downstream in the supply chain than with
the influence from industry-level formalities such as associa-
tions, standards, regulations, and legislation. For planning
firms, the value of the media as an information source that
may highlight issues affecting specific industries has a rating
that sits between these industry-level formalities. Industry-
level operational information sources are considered to be
important for planning firms and are central to the predomi-
nant group of important information sources that are based
around the experience of crisis rather than formal industry-
level influences on behavior. The greater value placed on
experiential rather than generic information and know-how
culminates in the highest value placed on information arising
from the organization's own experience of crisis, colleagues
within the firm, and from other firms in the same sector.

the mean rating given by planning and non-planning firms for
each information type (referred to as the relative value dis-
tance [RVD]) along with the differential between the scores
for information types for non-planning firms and the mid-
point on the scale at which a rising score indicates an increas-
ing level of perceived usefulness (known as value distance
from threshold), provide further insight into the perceived dif-
ferences between each information source (Table 2).
The data indicate that the largest RVDs between planning
and non-planning firms for information sources tend to be
the experience-derived sources (colleagues, firm experience
of crisis, important clients, other firm's experience of crisis
in their sector, other firm's experience of crisis outside their
sector), although legislation, regulation, and standards has
the fourth highest RVD. The organization's prior experience
of a crisis had small value distances between planning and
non-planning firms, and between the non-planning firm
score and the midpoint. This corresponds with the associa-
tion between experience of a crisis as a stimuli for the adop-
tion of CM planning, after which the intention to avoid or
prevent crises relegates the importance of this source of
information given the formalized intention to avoid the
occurrence/recurrence of interruptions (though recognizably
useful nonetheless).
The RVDs for information sources such a business sup-
port agencies, general government, and local authorities are
smaller. Given these sources' comparatively lower ratings
for usefulness by planning firms (rated below the midpoint
on the rating scale), the smaller value distances should not be
interpreted as an indication that little is required to change
non-planning firms' views of the value of the information
source. Instead, it highlights the question of whether--in the
light of bounded rationality--managers in a small firm con-
text should prioritize the sources that planning firms value
and value most. Table 2 also presents the difference for each
information source against the midpoint of the scale for
non-planning firms to highlight which sources are perceived
to be most and least distant from the point at which they are
deemed to be useful. This generates a measure of value dis-
tance from threshold. Here, the data reveal that didactic
sources have the greatest value distances from the threshold
of information value (3) whereas experiential sources rank
6th to 10th in value distance from threshold. Combined with
our understanding that these experiential sources are consid-
ered the most useful information sources by planning firms,
there is little distance between the ratings assigned by non-
planning firms and the threshold of information value,
whereas didactic sources rank first to fifth in their distance
away from the threshold of information value. This echoes
the findings in Herbane (2010) which, albeit a small sample
study, highlighted small firms' negative views about infor-
mation and guidance provided for small business support.
For planning firms, the information sources considered to
be useful are exclusively experience-based and derived from
the immediate or wider operational context in which the
organization resides and this reinforces the importance of
iconic and isomorphic learning (Toft & Reynolds, 1997).
Once information sources become less idiosyncratic and epi-
sodic to more generic and prescriptive in nature, planning
firms' evaluations of their value begin to approximate the
ratings that non-planning firms give to these less unimport-
ant sources. Only the experience of crisis as a source of
information came close to being deemed useful for non-plan-
ners as it had for planning firms.
Why might experience-based information be preferred?
One explanation is that information about the technicalities
of planning may no longer necessarily be a requirement for
firms with plans in place, and firms in this position no longer
need to be convinced of the need for planning. In addition,
firms may already have introduced crisis management plan-
ning because of need to comply with established industry
practices, regulation, legislation, and standards. In such

cases, compliance would be driven by guidelines and stan-
dards (such as British Standard (BS) 25999/International
Standard (ISO) 22301 for Business Continuity, ISO 17799
for Information Security, and ISO24672 Guidelines for
Information and Communication Technology Disaster
Recovery Services) that prescribe processes, activities, and
structures for emergency management and business continu-
ity. In contrast to the number 1 ranking for the media as a
source of information for non-planning firms, the media
ranked 7th of the 11 information sources for planning firms.
As noted above, this corresponds with a preference for expe-
rience-based information sources. The different position of
the media in the ranking of sources provides a further indica-
tion that firms with crisis management plans in place value
information sources that are more context-specific whereas
non-planners, having not yet come to appreciate the value of
experiential information sources (once plans are in place)
rate media as a useful information source. A further reason
may be found in the literature on trust and risk communica-
tion cited earlier where experiential information is imbued
with higher levels of trust (and subsequent acceptance and
use) than other sources of information.
Post-adoption, generic information is much less important
since planning firms already have an appreciation (or, at the
very least, an understanding) of the need for planning.
Experience-oriented information sources such as the firm's
own experiences of crises, insights from colleagues, impor-
tant clients, and other firms within and beyond the industry
may present dynamic inputs to the process of recursive learn-
ing (Elliott & Macpherson, 2010), which allow for the adjust-
ment of provisions set within crisis management plans.
Experiences also serve as reminders of the need for such
planning, the need for renewal of plans, and the hazards that
a business has faced or might encounter. Such experience-
related information act as stimuli to the process of unlearning
(Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984).
Conclusion
The main contribution of this study is to highlight and
address a notable gap in the body of crisis management lit-
erature, where post-crisis organizational and institutional
learning is long established, but consideration of how organi-
zations can learn to introduce crisis management planning
(and where new information sources are important) is largely
ignored. In adopting a learning for crisis perspective, this
study has established that experiential information is per-
ceived by SME owner managers to be more important than
generic advisory information.These preferences are observed
between planning and non-planning firms. With planning in
place, these organizations indicated a strong preference to
experiential information sources as determined by the mea-
sure of RVD. The additional measure of value distance from
threshold highlights the large distance that some sources are
perceived to be from becoming useful for firms wishing to
introduce planning to deal with serious interruptions and
incidents. Planning firms'preference for experience-oriented
information about crisis management and business continu-
ity planning raises questions about how SMEs might be sup-
ported in both the initial development and renewal of their
knowledge about these planning activities so that such feed-
back and learning can improve their adaptive capacity
(Staber & Sydow, 2002) as a continuous and dynamic learn-
ing process through which complexity and uncertainty are
better understood. Support networks and forums for business
continuity are well-established in a local government context
(e.g., Local Resilience Forums) and for large firms in spe-
cific sectors such as financial services (e.g., The Business
Continuance Group), and the role of industry associations
and business support agencies in bringing together SMEs to
share experiences and practices within and across areas of
economic activity would appear to be a valuable way to
encourage greater firm-level and local economy business
resilience.
A number of directions for future research arise from this
study. These include exploration and examination of why the
valued information sources for planning firms are distin-
guished from the less valued ones--Is it the act of planning
that has shifted these perceptions or other factors? Could dis-
tinctions be due to some sources being perceived to be more
useful as precursors to planning and others more useful as
stimuli to maintain and develop crisis management plans
within the organization? Second, what are the features of the
sources of information that planning firms find useful and
what is it that non-planning firms consider not useful, visi-
ble, or accessible? Examination of each information source
in more detail (e.g., within media type, specific regulation,
legislation, and standards) will also illuminate our under-
standing of the comparative importance of these institutional
influences for planning and non-planning firms. An emerg-
ing point of debate is whether agility (due to flexibility, rapid
decision making, and flatter structures) and resilience are
mutually exclusive properties in SMEs that characterize their
propensity for, and response to, serious interruptions and
incidents (Gao, Sung, & Zhang, 2013; Sullivan-Taylor &
Branicki, 2011). Are SMEs better able to respond to the del-
eterious effects of "surprises" that lead to improvisation and
bricolage (Bechky & Ockhuysen, 2011) than to defend from
or prevent such events using formal structures and knowl-
edge? What role does information availability, type (experi-
ence versus didactic), and perceived value play in this
context?
As the imperative for business resilience cascades across
the British economy and beyond, policy makers and business
support agencies are increasingly seeking to engage with
SMEs to support their resilience and enterprise growth.
Given the insights derived from this study, the dissonance
between information provision and informational needs may
reduce the value that such engagement could achieve.
Accordingly, where business support agencies volunteer (or
8 SAGE Open
are compelled) to provide support to SMEs in relation to cri-
sis management/business continuity planning, careful assess-
ment should be given to whether the information that they
provide loses relevance for firms with or without plans, and
how their information provision might be refined to provide
information that is differentiated in terms of the transition of
an SME between the absence and presence of formal pro-
cesses to deal with crises.
Note
1. Readers will note that "Crisis Management" is used here as
the singular term for activities of interest in this article, but it
is recognized that there can be differences in both the preferred
form of reference and the scope of associated activities. For
instance, "incident management" is commonplace within civil
emergencies, traffic control, construction, and health care set-
tings (Ali Shah, Kim, Baek, Chang, &Ahn, 2008; McLennann,
Holgate, Omodei, & Wearing, 2006; Rogers, 2010; Zhou, Li,
& Wu, 2012), whereas "business continuity management" is
commonplace in commercial and supply chain contexts (Clark,
2012; Järveläinen, 2013; Ojha & Gokhale, 2009). Similarly,
crisis management may be considered an umbrella term rather
than the specific terms of reference used by and between orga-
nizations in the context of an incident or interruption.
