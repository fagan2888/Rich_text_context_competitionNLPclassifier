Introduction
During the first decade of the 21st century social media
became a driving force for reporting and distributing news
articles. Readers populated social media with recommenda-
tions and suggestions for news articles, offering a view into
audience agency and giving newsmakers an opportunity to
understand how readers react to news articles. Social net-
working sites allowed readers to engage with each other and
share stories. News sites introduced widgets, small applica-
tions that can be installed into websites to link back to news
outlet content. Social bookmarking tools empowered users to
rate news content and amplified their preferences for indi-
vidual stories.
During this period, news outlets turned to social network-
ing sites to compete in a fast-changing media landscape.
Traditional newspapers developed strategies and experi-
mented with paywall models to monetize the circulation of
news articles. Following the Wall Street Journal, The New
York Times and German publisher Axel Springer AG intro-
duced a metered paywall for their websites of daily national
newspapers. British News International protected the content
of The Times and The Sunday Times behind an "iron-curtain,"
and a number of Brazilian newspapers implemented metered
paywalls to access the newspapers' content.
These attempts to monetize news followed market-based
strategies to capture attention on social networks. A number
of news outlets appointed social media editors and integrated
print and digital operations. The evolving landscape of news
delivery compelled organizations to invest in Research and
Development and to investigate innovative business solu-
tions beyond the industry domain. In this period, a number of
news outlets--notably The Guardian, The New York Times,
USA Today, and National Public Radio (NPR)--deployed
publicly available Application Programming Interfaces
(API) that allow users to programmatically access data using
configurable parameters (Aitamurto & Lewis, 2013).
Twitter increasingly became a channel for breaking news
stories (Ovide, 2009) and was associated with the diffusion

Tweeting News Articles: Readership
and News Sections in Europe and the
Americas
Marco Toledo Bastos1 and Gabriela Zago2
Abstract
In this article we investigate the impact of social media readership to the editorial profile of newspapers. We analyze tweets
containing links to news articles from eight of the largest national newspapers in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain,
Brazil, and Germany. The data collection follows the first two weeks of October 2012 and includes 2,842,699 tweets
with links to news articles. Twitter-shortened links were resolved using a three-pass routine and assigned to 1 of the 21
newspaper sections. We found the concentration of links to news articles posted by top users to be lower than reported in
the literature and the strategy of relaying headlines on Twitter via automatic news aggregators (feeds) to be inefficient. The
results of this investigation show which sections of a newspaper are the most and least read by readers in different parts of
the world, with German readers placing greater emphasis on Politics and Economy; Brazilians on Sports and Arts; Spaniards
on Local and National news; Britons and Americans on Opinion and World news. We also found that German and Spanish
readers are more likely to read multiple national newspapers, while British readers more often resort to foreign sources of
news. The results confirm that feedback to news items from a large user base is pivotal for the replication of content and that
newspapers and news items can be clustered according to the editorial profile and principles of newsworthiness inherited
from legacy media. The results of this investigation shed light onto the networked architecture of journalism that increasingly
depends on readership agency.

of hard news topics (Conover et al., 2011; Larsson & Moe,
2012) and with the exponential growth in infotainment news
(Hargittai & Litt, 2011). As social media became a central
channel for the distribution of news articles across the
Internet, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone announced the com-
pany's ambition to create a "Twitter News Service" for major
news organizations (Bastos, Travitzki, & Puschmann, 2012;
Cowan, 2010). The announcement was in line with a series
of modifications to emphasize Twitter's news and informa-
tion-network strategy, and followed early attempts to build a
news processing system that could harness the platform's
potential for real-time news propagation (Sankaranarayanan,
Samet, Teitler, Lieberman, & Sperling, 2009).
In this paper, we investigate how circulation and classifi-
cation of news are impacted by the growing use of social
networks to distribute news articles. Although online news
has grown rapidly to become a major source of news in
Western countries (Pew Research Center, 2012; Reuters
Institute for the Study of Journalism [RISJ], 2013), research
focusing on online news is largely informed by the rationale
set by print media and seldom evaluates the impact of social
media to the building blocks of newsmaking. We expect the
results of this investigation to shed light onto the production
of news that evolved into a live scheme of news reporting.
We will show how the relative distribution of news articles
per section changes across countries and why the difference
between broadsheet and tabloid newspapers created by leg-
acy media organizations is still appropriate.
Previous Work
The key factors governing the newsworthiness of informa-
tion have changed considerably since Otto Groth (1928)
described the newspaper qualifications and article attributes
and Galtung and Ruge (1965) identified the 13 factors gov-
erning newsworthiness. Tunstall (1971) commented that
because Galtung and Ruge's dataset was restricted to the
coverage of international crises, the authors ignored day-to-
day coverage of lesser, domestic and mundane news. Seizing
on Galtung and Ruge's seminal work, journalism research
have periodically revisited the principles of newsworthiness.
Shoemaker and Reese (1996) offered a historical overview
of the theory of newsworthiness and established that the pro-
cess of selecting which events are covered by media depended
not only on the topic, but also on the presentation of the topic
and the available information.
The reevaluation of Galtung and Ruge's research on the
factors' driving newsworthiness led to a general consensus
that the context of print media is one of increasing editorial
emphasis on entertainment (Franklin, 1997). Harcup and
O'Neill (2001) commented on Franklin's work and pointed
out that no contemporary set of news values can be complete
without the entertainment factor. The authors offered a
revised version of Galtung and Ruge's original set of factors
into what Harcup and O'Neill called Newspaper Agenda.
The criteria that govern newsworthiness became an impor-
tant item on the agenda of journalism research and a number
of empirical studies examined the predictability of news cov-
erage in western industrialized (Kepplinger & Ehmig, 2006;
Pritchard & Hughes, 1997) and developing countries
(Schwarz, 2006).
The organization of news items according to sections is a
legacy from print media that is subject to change due to audi-
ence interference on newsroom decisions. Print newspapers
have traditionally operated with preprint templates dedicated
to the news sections of the paper. These preprinted sections
were often mass-produced and stacked in suitable storage
areas prior to the offset printing of current news (Fernandez-
Rana, Simon, & Peserik, 1974; Pérez-Peña, 2008). Schudson
(2011) commented that the distribution of items per section
have changed from mid-20th-century news reporting,
focused on political and socioeconomic issues, to infotain-
ment news covering celebrities' personal lives and showbiz
events. But despite the substantial literature on online news
as a source of information, and on news sections on print
press, research focusing on the effects of audience agency on
the distribution of items per section is still forthcoming.
The early literature on digital news was mostly focused
on investigating whether information retrieval was more
efficient in digital platforms, thereby allowing for a relative
increase in user's information consumption and news reten-
tion. In the late nineties, a group of Scandinavian researchers
visited three news organizations over a period of 3 years. The
researchers investigated structural changes in the production
of news due to digital platforms and reported differences that
set news websites apart from print media (Eriksen &
Ihlstrom, 2000). Still according to this early research, news
websites focus on hard news and foster the continuous
streaming of news similar to live reporting. During the same
period, Dimitrova, Connolly-Ahern, Williams, Kaid, and
Reid (2003) looked at how online newspapers used hyper-
links to refer readers to outside websites and suggested that
the gatekeeping role of online editors had remained strong.
There is also a sizable literature on the impact of online
news to print newspapers. Filistrucchi, Fiesolana, and
Domenico (2005) investigated the effect of websites of daily
newspapers in Italy and reported a negative impact on sales of
local newspapers. George (2008) studied the effects of the
Internet to the audience of traditional American newspapers
and found evidence that the Internet attracts younger and edu-
cated individuals away from daily newspapers and the oppo-
site effect (higher newspaper circulation) among African
Americans and Hispanics. Gentzkow (2007) analyzed the
Washington, D.C., market with a model that evaluates com-
plement consumption instead of competition between exist-
ing products. Gentzkow found that print and online
newspapers are strong complements, even though online
newspaper reduced print readership by 27,000 per day.
Research focused on readership of news sections across
different media platforms is relatively scarce. D'Haenens,
Bastos and Zago 3
Jankowski, and Heuvelman (2004) investigated the varia-
tions in readership between digital and print versions of two
Dutch newspapers and reported no significant differences in
the consumption of news in print and online platforms.
However, the researchers noted a significant difference in the
amount of time spent reading each news sections in print and
online newspapers and found that more time was spent read-
ing the online versions of the newspapers across all news
sections, except for sports and local news, and that online
readers recall more international news and less sports than
readers of the print version. The research also found a much
higher volume of local news and a higher volume of news
articles overall in the print edition of the newspapers.
Quandt (2008) compared the overall distribution of arti-
cles per news sections on online news websites with patterns
from content analyses of press and TV coverage (Shoemaker
& Cohen, 2012). The researcher found a similar pattern
across the news ecosystem, with emphasis on national poli-
tics and economy, followed by human-interest stories, inter-
national politics, crimes, sport, and culture. The investigation
reported that online journalism--perhaps contrary to expec-
tation--was fairly conventional in regard to the distribution
of news items per news section (or topic categories).
Although the researchers found striking similarities between
websites inside a country, they also reported remarkable dif-
ferences from country to country.
Still according to Quandt (2008), German websites fea-
tured less national politics and more economy, sports, and
culture; British websites featured an average number of
items about politics, but far more human-interest stories and
"social affairs" in comparison with websites in other coun-
tries; French websites featured a high number of world news,
but mostly focused on politics, with 60% of Le Monde's
articles and 50% of Figaro's news articles being classified as
politics; U.S. websites presented a high volume of news arti-
cles on crime-related stories and a higher-than-average vol-
ume of political news articles, with about 50% of the content
being classified as politics; Russian websites covered mostly
politics, economy, and crime. The results indicated that news
websites were not nearly as international as the researcher
expected, with content being limited by the traditional,
national, and linguistic interests of the readers.
Recent studies have addressed the newspapers' audience
beyond the paradigm of production associated with unidirec-
tional information. Aitamurto and Lewis (2013) investigated
the impact of open APIs at four news organizations and
reported the change in news consumption habits as audi-
ences become more fragmented and accustomed to gathering
news from several sources rather than a single destination
site. Mitchelstein and Boczkowski (2009, 2010) reviewed
the research on online news production and described a pre-
vailing preference for theoretical and methodological pro-
posals that evolved from theAmerican literature on the topic,
and also commented on the scarce availability of research
that considered events taking place in other parts of the
world. The researchers advocate the need for investigations
that look at phenomena across different locales.
As newsrooms become more dependent on networking
technology, and as journalists increasingly use social media
to reach the public (RISJ, 2013), researchers have started to
investigate the impact of social media to the news ecosys-
tem. Hong (2012) examined the relationship between news
organizations' adoption of social media and online reader-
ship and reported a positive correlation between newspapers'
adoption of social media and increase in online readership.
Messner, Linke, and Eford (2011) used content analysis to
investigate the adoption of Twitter by American news outlets
and reported that news organizations failed to use Twitter as
a community-building tool. Common to these recent studies
is the focus on social media agency, with readers engaging in
instantaneous responses to articles or events and imposing
challenges to the scholarly division between studies of pro-
duction and consumption tied to the unidirectional informa-
tion architecture.
Objectives
In this article, we investigate how major print newspapers
perform in social media across five countries, taking into
consideration audience agency and the integration of multi-
ple media ecosystems. We investigate how the distribution of
news articles changes across countries and whether tradi-
tional models of print media endure in social networks. We
hypothesized that the editorial profile of print newspapers is
reflected on social media and can be confirmed using cluster
analysis of the relative volume of news articles covering
Politics, Economy, Sports, Opinion, and National or World
news. We also expect the clustering algorithms to identify
newspapers dedicated to hard news stories and papers com-
mitted to soft news topics, particularly Entertainment, Crime,
Sports, Lifestyle, Celebrities, and events triggered by the
public's curiosity.
Recent studies have explored the correlation between the
distribution of news articles per section streamed on Twitter
and the distribution of articles per section published on qual-
ity papers (Bastos, in press). The results indicated that Twitter
is the only social network to present a statistically significant
correlation with the distribution of news items per sections
on The Guardian and The New York Times (r = .89 and .68,
respectively, p < .001). Based on these recent findings, we
expect the diversity of links to news articles that appeared on
Twitter stream to be a good predictor of the editorial profile
of online newspapers.
Although we cannot determine the consistency of the cri-
teria used to assign items to news sections across news out-
lets, this can be partially controlled for by analyzing only
quality papers that rely on a more uniform baseline of news
editors'decisions. For that reason, we have excluded popular
tabloids from this research and focused on quality papers
with editorial styles that encompass the extremes of the
4 SAGE Open
broadsheet/tabloid spectrum. The terms broadsheets and tab-
loids stem from paper format--the earlier being printed on
A1 paper and the later in variations of the smallerA3 paper--
but have been adopted to refer to editorial decisions that
define newspapers' journalism standards, setting quality
press (broadsheets) apart from popular press (tabloids). We
expect the analysis of the data to indicate whether social
media users interact with content in a way that validates the
division between broadsheet and tabloids perceived in print
newspapers.
Broadsheet papers use investigative approaches to news
that emphasize in-depth coverage and a sober tone in articles
and editorials, with smaller headlines and fewer pictures that
are expected in high-quality journalism (Preston, 2004).
While broadsheet newspapers emphasize hard news cover-
age, fact-checking and research based on a timeline in which
the story unfolds, tabloid newspapers present on average
lesser detailed articles, often directed by marketing depart-
ments and heavily influenced by demographic appeal and
audience share. According to Andersen (2003), tabloid read-
ership is on average younger and less educated. The detailed
coverage of political issues offered by broadsheets also
results in a readership more interested in politics and more
likely to be well informed.
The rationale of this study is to assess the editorial profile
of online newspapers in the face of social media feedback to
news items. The editorial profile of newspapers is defined by
the emphasis news outlets place on specific topics. The edi-
torial profile of newspapers Wall Street Journal, Financial
Times, Financial Times Deutschland, and Valor Econômico
are defined by a strong emphasis on business and economic
news, while Los Angeles Times--likely due to the location of
the newspaper's headquarters in the Los Angeles--presents
a higher-than-average occurrence of infotainment news and
a special emphasis on the American film industry. A similar
prevalence of soft news content is found on newspapers New
York Post and New York Daily News, while newspapers The
New York Times, The Guardian, and The Independent present
a higher-than-average emphasis on hard news topics, partic-
ularly Politics, Economy, and World news.
Data
Forty Newspapers Spanning Five Countries
We monitored tweets containing links to news articles from
eight of the largest national newspapers in the United
States, United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and Germany. The
data span from Monday, October 1, 2012 (00:00:00
Greenwich Mean Time [GMT]) to Sunday, October 14,
2012 (23:59:59 GMT), thus including 2 weeks of data col-
lection. News outlets were selected based on the circulation
of print newspapers in Germany (Informationsgemeinschaft
zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.,
2012), Spain (Oficina de Justificación de la Difusión
[CirculationAudit Bureau; OJD], 2012), Brazil (Associação
Nacional de Jornais, 2011), the United Kingdom (Audit
Bureau of Circulations [ABC], 2012), and the United States
(Alliance for Audited Media, 2012).
The data were retrieved using the software yourTwapper-
Keeper (O'Brien, 2010) that connects to Twitter streaming
API and allows for keyword monitoring. The dataset includes
a total of 2,842,699 tweets divided into 123,191 from German
news outlets, 394,533 from Brazilian news outlets, 792,952
from Spanish news outlets, 537,606 from British news out-
lets, and 994,417 from American news outlets. From the
2,842,699 tweets containing links to news articles in the
dataset, 64,605 are mention-messages (AT) and 1,026,296
are retweet-messages.
For the purposes of this investigation, we only analyzed
national newspapers and excluded magazines and tabloid-
journalism newspapers. Therefore, the dataset does not
include British tabloids Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, and The
Sun; German tabloid Bild; Spanish news outlets Qué!;
American tabloids The Globe and National Enquirer; and
Brazilian newspapers Super Notícia, Extra, and Correio do
Povo. It does not include the magazines The Economist, Der
Spiegel, Focus, Veja, Newsweek, and The New Yorker. British
newspapers The Sunday Telegraph and The Independent on
Sunday were not included because they lack a dedicated
Internet website and depended on their sister papers to relay
news articles on the Internet.
Although on average more readers read tabloids than
broadsheets (Murphy, 2003), tabloid newspapers like Bild,
The Sun, and Enquirer were not included in this study due to
the editorial styles not conforming to the principles of quality
press that we investigate in this article. Moreover, the signifi-
cantly higher circulation of tabloids can skew the dataset and
strongly affect the analysis of national newspapers. London-
based newspaper Daily Express, though arguably a tabloid-
newspaper, was selected to fill the position of the eighth
national newspaper in the United Kingdom due to the circu-
lation figures similar to national quality papers. Table 1
shows all news outlets investigated in this study.
Data Cleaning and Processing
We removed spam messages from the dataset and tabulated
the data according to the attention share (sheer number of
links) received by each news outlet and the overall volume of
links per country. The processed data shows the circulation
of highly retweeted and mentioned messages, the relative
occurrence of overlapping users, and the concentration of
links to news articles posted by top users. About one third of
the dataset (35%) includes links to American news outlets,
while Spanish newspapers account for more than a quarter
(28%) and British newspapers for about a fifth (19%) of the
dataset. The remaining fifth of the dataset includes Brazilian
(14%) and German (4%) news outlets. Figure 1 shows the
distribution of links to news outlets in the United States,
Bastos and Zago 5
United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and Germany during the 14
days of data collection.
News Articles Timeline
Visualizing the longitudinal distribution of news articles
through the day is challenging because of the multiple time
zones in the United States and Brazil and the different time
zones in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Germany. Time
zones were adjusted to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)+0
(GMT), using Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone as refer-
ence for news articles from the United States, Brasília for
Brazil, and the official times for the United Kingdom, Spain,
and Germany. Figure 2 shows the timeline of news articles
through the day and indicates an abrupt peak of American
links to news articles as early as 05:00 followed by subse-
quent peaks at 09:00, 14:30, and again at 17:30. Links to
news articles in other countries follow a similar pattern, yet
the peak is not as accentuated as observed in the United
States. Links to news articles of Spanish newspapers present
a slightly different pattern, increasing steadily from 06:00 to
11:00 and decreasing abruptly from 12:00 to 16:00, likely
due to Spaniards routine of slowing down for lunch around
13:00 and the institution of midday sleep (siesta) from 14:00
to 16:00.
Twitter Clients
The processed data indicate which Twitter client was used to
post links to news articles, thus allowing for the identifica-
tion of news articles being actively distributed by users or by
automatic applications. We found that twitterfeed, a utility
that allows the feeding of content from website Rich Site
Summary (RSS) feeds to Twitter; HootSuite, a social media
management system for brand management; and dlvr.it, an
application that automatically delivers content to paid media
channels, were responsible on average for 25% of all links to
news articles. The remaining 75% is mainly distributed
across Twitter website (19%), Tweet Button (12%), Twitter
for iPhone (9%), and Twitter for Android (7%). The data are
consistent with previous reports (Sysomos, 2009) that found
fewer than half of tweets being posted using the web user
interface, and that most users used third-party applications.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of Twitter clients per
country.
Due to the high diversity of clients operating within the
Twitter system--as of July 2011, Twitter's ecosystem com-
prised over one million applications, services, and clients
(Twitter, 2011)--We manually coded Twitter services, cli-
ents, and applications into four groups according to user's
usage: desktop, mobile, feeds, and managers. These groups

indicate whether links were distributed by active users or
generated by automatic updates. The first group includes
desktop applications and web services that depend on user's
input to feed Twitter's microblogging service via desktop
software or Internet browsers. The second group also requires
user's input and includes news articles posted using mobile
platforms, including tablets and mobile phones.
The third group contains news items relayed automati-
cally by bots or news feed, so that content is frequently
updated and distributed on Twitter from the publisher's web-
site. The last group refers to social media management plat-
forms, which integrate a number of social networks and
provide elementary analytics. Social media optimization
(SMO) services that aim at increasing the awareness of a
product, brand, or event, such as SocialFlow and dlvr.it, were
split between the third (feeds) and the fourth (managers)
groups depending on the company's business model.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of Twitter clients used to
post news articles across countries and the distribution of
Twitter clients per country. Even though Desktop (39%),
Mobile (34%), and Feeds (25%) are the predominant source
of news articles across the dataset, Figure 4 shows a signifi-
cant variance across countries. Countries with a large num-
ber of highly active users, such as the United States, United
Kingdom, and Spain present a much higher percentage of
links to news articles from mobile platforms, while countries
with fewer highly active users present a lower incidence of
mobile platforms and a much higher percentage of items
automatically relayed by news aggregators (news feeds) and
bots.

Method
Singletons
We analyzed the data to understand how news items are
released on Twitter and the prevailing news sections in each
country. We relied on the classification of Twitter clients to
investigate the relationship between the diversity of Twitter
clients and the replication of news articles on Twitter. We
identified the news outlets that resorted to Twitter as a mere
broadcasting channel and the outlets that relied on Twitter to
engage with their audiences by calculating the percentage of
messages with links to news article that did not generate any
conversation by means of RT, AT, or replication of the link to
the news article. We called these messages singletons, as
they refer to a set of messages with exactly one element (rep-
lication = 0). We compared the percentage of singletons with
the percentage of messages relayed automatically by bots or
news aggregators (feeds).
Resolving Twitter Links
Links shared on Twitter are automatically shortened to the
http://t.co wrapper, and as a result we had to resolve 2,842,699
links before classifying news articles into news sections.
Twitter links were expanded using a three-pass routine to
resolve nested shortened URLs (i.e., previously shortened
bit.ly URLs that are again shortened by the t.co URL wrap-
per) and to retrieve the target URLs. After resolving the
addresses, we removed links that returned error, spam, or
sweepstakes (promotional offers).
Hard-paywalled links allow minimal to no access to con-
tent without paid subscription, and most of the links pointed
to British newspapers The Times and The Sunday Times, and
to American news outlet The Wall Street Journal. Articles
from news outlets that have adopted "hard paywalls"
amounted to 20,655 news links that could not be classified
and were thus removed from the dataset. We also removed
links that failed to be replicated or that pointed to newspa-
pers' Picture of the Day, as the varied content could not be
classified into any newspaper section. Tables 2 and 3 show
the process of converting Twitter raw data with tweet and
parsed shortened URL into a table with resolved URLs and
the section of the news articles.
Assigning News Sections
News articles with web URL link format that did not include
the news section of articles impose further challenges to the
analysis. American newspaper The Wall Street Journal,
German newspaper die Tageszeitung, British The Sunday
Times, and Spanish daily newspapers El Correo, El Periodico,
and La Razón adopted domain structures that frequently lack
the section of the news article. In these cases, we performed
a customized search with regular expression matching to
identify the newspaper sections. Blogs affiliated with media
outlets also posed challenges to the classification and
required customized regular expressions given the wide vari-
ety of domain structure observed, but the final processed
data also include blog posts from journalists affiliated to the
investigated newspapers.
El País popular special section "Viñetas," commentator
articles, and open-editorials were grouped in the section
Opinion, which also includes editorials and newspapers' col-
umnist articles. A number of German newspapers have a spe-
cial section on bicycles, particularly Die Zeit, and these news
articles were grouped in the section Cars because they refer
to bicycles as a means of transport. Articles on parenting
were classified in the Lifestyle section, elections in the
Politics group, obituaries in Local News, Career in Jobs,
Travel advice in Tourism, and Videogames in Entertainment
(not in Technology). Table 4 shows a column with news sec-
tions across countries and the most common labeled news

sections in each country (sample from a bag-of-words with
1,616 words).
The final dataset includes 693,066 news articles each clas-
sified into one of the following 21 news sections: Arts, Cars,
Crime, Economy, Education, Entertainment, Environment,
Fashion, Health, Jobs, Lifestyle, Local news, National news,
World news, Opinion, Politics, Science, Sports, Technology,
Tourism, and Weather. Our method of classification success-
fully resolved, identified, and assigned news sections to
693,066 news articles from a total of 1,013,286 URL links,
thus successfully classifying 68% of the news articles. The
processed data offers an interesting and novel overview of
news articles that circulated on the Twittersphere during the
period under investigation.
Clustering Analysis
We exploited our prior knowledge of the properties of the
dataset and used the "elbow" method (percentage of variance
explained as a function of the number of clusters) to deter-
mine the appropriate value of k. We found the optimal
number of clusters to be 4 over 100,000 iterations on the
relationship between newspapers, and 2 clusters over
100,000 iterations on the relationship between news sec-
tions. We applied a standard clustering algorithm (k-means)
using Euclidean distance on the frequency of news sections
per newspaper. We also calculated the hierarchic clustering
by transforming the affiliation matrix into a distance matrix
between newspapers and news sections. The first clustering
analysis was performed using a matrix of pairwise dissimi-
larities (1-similarity) between newspapers, and the second
clustering analysis was performed on a matrix of pairwise
dissimilarities between news sections.
The aim of the clustering analysis is to evaluate whether
user's preference for news sections and news outlets reflects
the perceived editorial decisions made by newspapers and
newspersons that separate newspapers into broadsheets and
tabloids--the first group including news outlets with focus
on hard news, and the later including newspapers that focus
on infotainment and soft news events. The second clustering
analysis on a matrix of news sections was performed to eval-
uate whether the online distribution of news articles is

consistent with traditional journalism classification of news
items between hard and soft news. The results of these analy-
ses are presented in the next section.
Results
Readership
We found that the number of links to news articles from AT
varies little across news outlets of different countries (X =
0.3%), but the number of links to news articles from retweet-
messages (RT) varies considerably (X = 7%), being signifi-
cantly higher in Spanish news outlets (44%) and significantly
lower in German newspapers (24%). We also found that the
proportion of retweeted news articles in American, British,
and Brazilian news outlets is fairly equal (X = 1%). Figure
5 shows the number of links to news articles from tweets, RT,
and AT for each of the 40 news outlets investigated in this
study.
We found statistical significant correlations between the
volume of tweets, retweets, and the number of connections
between users that relayed a news article link. Leading news-
papers within their respective countries presented statistically
significant correlations between retweets and tweets (r = .92,
p < .001) and between retweets and network topology (r = .92
and r = .89, respectively, p < .001), particularly the news out-
lets The New York Times and Washington Post in the United
States, The Guardian and Daily Telegraph in the United
Kingdom, El País and El Mundo in Spain, Estado de S.Paulo
and Folha de S.Paulo in Brazil, and Die Welt and Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany.
We examined the concentration of links to news articles
posted by top users and found that on average 5% of users
are responsible for 50% of links to news articles across the
five countries, being as high as 62% in Brazil and as low as
46% in the United Kingdom. Table 5 shows that on average
50% of all URL links to news articles are posted by just 5%
of users, but our results are at odds with the importance of
top users found in previous studies on the distribution of
URL links. Wu, Hofman, Mason, and Watts (2011) reported
that less than 0.05% of Twitter users attracted almost 50% of
all attention within Twitter, while our results indicate that
0.05% of Twitter users posted on average only 10% of URL
links to news articles and significantly less in highly active
countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.
The results also present a point of departure from previous
investigations that identified the importance of gatekeeping
in online newspapers (Dimitrova et al., 2003) and confirm
the influence of a large community of least-active users
(Bastos, Raimundo, & Travitzki, 2013) that posted one fifth
of the links to news articles that circulated on Twitter in the
period.
Table 6 shows the overlapping of users (shared reader-
ship) across different countries and within the same country.
These figures refer to users that posted links to more than one
news outlet within the same country, in the

latter case, and to news outlets of different countries, in
the former case. The table shows high cross-readership
within Germany and Spain and low cross-readership within
the United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil. These fig-
ures refer to the percentage of users that read and post links
to more than one news outlet in the country and indicate that
German and Spanish users read on average more different
newspapers than their counterparts in Brazil, United
Kingdom, and United States.
The table also shows that British users read a higher-than-
average volume of news articles from foreign countries,
likely due to the remarkably high cross-readership between
American and British readers (40,368 users distributed links
to American and British newspapers). The table also shows
that Spanish and Brazilian readers are the least likely to read
and distribute links to news articles of foreign countries.
Perhaps
surprisingly, British readers are more likely to read and
distribute content to supplementary newspapers outside the
country than read and distribute links to additional British
newspapers.
We compared the percentage of links to news articles per
newspaper on Twitter with the newspapers' market share in
print circulation, which was calculated based solely on the
set of eight newspapers in each country. Table 7 shows the
countrywise differences between the percentage of printed
newspapers' circulation and the percentage of news articles
on Twitter. We highlighted in red the figures of news outlets

experiencing a decline in the circulation of news links on
Twitter relative to the figures of print newspapers. Sixty per-
cent of the newspapers investigated in this study are experi-
encing a decline in the readership share in comparison with
their print circulation.
USA Today, Daily Express, Zero Hora, and Die Zeit are
the news outlets that registered the highest losses, while Los
Angeles Times, The Guardian, The Independent, El País,
Estado de S.Paulo, and Die Welt present a higher share in the
volume of links to news articles on Twitter relative to the
circulation of their printed newspapers. In Spain, even
though the fluctuation is lower-than-average compared with
other countries, we found that only El País and ABC news
outlets presented an increase in the ratio between the circula-
tion of printed newspapers and the diffusion of news articles
on Twitter.
Broadcasting Singletons
NewsoutletswithhighlevelsofengagementonTwittersphere,
such as The Times, El País, El Mundo, Estado de S.Paulo,
O Globo, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal consis-
tently reported lower number of singletons and lower per-
centage of messages relayed by automatic aggregators
(feeds). Based on this finding, we tested the hypothesis that
news outlets that have most of their content posted via auto-
matic feeds, using tools that link content from website RSS
feeds to Twitter, are bound to generate low levels of interac-
tion regardless of the volume of messages posted on Twitter.
The results confirmed the hypothesis, showing a two-tier
structure of highly interactive news outlets, with lower than
average number of singletons and low number of tweets
posted via RSS feeds, and a group of highly active, but not
highly interactive group of news outlets, which resort to
Twitter as another channel to rely content irrespective to
feedback from users.
We found a significant correlation between news articles
relayed by automatic feeds and news articles that failed to
engage the audiences at the national level and with respect to
each news outlet. We performed a statistical correlation anal-
ysis on the two variables and found that the proportion of
singleton have a significant correlation with the proportion
of tweets relayed by automatic feeds (r = .78, p < .001). We
have not found any further positive significant correlation
with the remaining Twitter clients used to post messages.
Mobile and Desktop platforms presented negative correla-
tions with the number of singletons (r = ­.64 and r = ­.56,
respectively, p < .001), and social media management plat-
forms did not present significant results (r = .24, p < .001).
We conducted a t-test of statistical significance to compare
the percentage of tweets posted from news feeds and the per-
centage of singletons on each news outlet. The results of the
t-test within 40 newspapers rejected the null hypothesis of
unequal variances, indicating symmetrical variances and
positive correlation between tweets posted from news feeds
and singletons--that is, tweets that did not generate any con-
versation, t(39) = 31.82, p < .001.
Based on these results, we fitted a linear regression model
between the percentage of tweets posted from news feeds
and the percentage of singletons on each news outlet. Even
without removing outliers, the results of the linear regression
reported a Multiple R of .78 with R Square of .61 and
Adjusted R Square of .60 (p < .001), thus indicating that
news articles released on Twitter by automatic feeds tend to
generate little to no reaction and are unlikely to be read.
Figure 6 shows the percentage of singletons and the percent-
age of tweets posted from news feeds with the fitted linear
regression model. Figure 7 shows the percentage of repli-
cated news articles and the percentage of tweets posted from
desktop Twitter clients with the fitted linear regression
model.
The results indicate a linear relationship between news
articles posted from news feeds and news articles that are not
replicated. Conversely, there is a linear relationship between
news articles posted from desktop Twitter clients and mes-
sages that are replicated. The results indicate that the news
outlets' strategy of automatically broadcasting their content
to social media is not effective, as the links to news articles
are not replicated and likely remain ignored. On the other
hand, news articles posted from Twitter desktop clients pres-
ent a linear relationship with message replication, therefore
suggesting that news articles actively posted and commented

News Sections Per Country
We found that the prominence of news sections varies con-
siderably from country to country. American newspapers
present a lower-than-average volume of articles about Arts,
Economy, and Local news, and a higher-than-average vol-
ume of news articles covering Entertainment, Fashion,
Opinion, National, and World news. Links to news articles
from British newspapers are more often Opinion,
Environment, Education, Lifestyle, and World news pieces,
and less often about Politics, Local, and National news.
Spanish news articles present a higher-than-average inci-
dence of Local and National news and a lower-than-average
incidence of news articles on Politics and Sports.
Links to Brazilian news articles proportionally empha-
size Sports, Arts, Education, Technology, and National
news, but also present a lower-than-average volume of news
articles about Economy, Opinion, and World news. German
news outlets present a much higher-than-average volume of
news articles about Economy and Politics and much lower-
than-average volume of news articles about Entertainment,
Opinion, and National news. Figures 8 shows the absolute
number of news articles per section across countries and
Figure 9 shows the normalized (relative) performance of
each news section per country.

Broadsheets Versus Tabloids
We investigated whether the separation between broadsheet
and tabloids used in print newspapers is consistent with the
content distributed online. Although we have focused on
quality newspapers, the editorial styles of news outlets inves-
tigated in this study present a variation that encompasses the
broadsheet and tabloid spectrum. We confirmed the hypoth-
esis that newspapers can be grouped by cluster algorithms
based on the relative volume of news articles covering hard
and soft news topics, and the groups classified by the cluster-
ing analysis are consistent with the perceived editorial style
of the news outlets.
The results revealed a clear division between news out-
lets that emphasize infotainment news and news outlets that
cover hard news stories. The clustering analysis with
k-means algorithm reported four clusters comprehending
11, 12, 5, and 12 news outlets, respectively. Group 1 clus-
tered papers with a large volume of soft news items, includ-
ing Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, New York
Post, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today, The Sunday Times, El
Correo, La Vanguardia, Estado de S.Paulo, Jornal do
Commercio, and Zero Hora. Group 2 clustered most German
newspapers and includes The Washington Post, Evening
Standard, El Periódico, Folha de S.Paulo, Valor Econômico,
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau,
Financial Times Deutschland, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Die
Tagesspiegel, Die Welt, and Die Zeit.
Group 3 includes local news outlets or newspapers with a
larger-than-average volume of local news, including Daily
Express, ABC, La Razón, La Voz de Galicia, and Correio
Braziliense. Group 4 includes the leading newspapers in
most countries and also clustered news outlets with an edito-
rial emphasis on high journalism standards. This last group

comprehends The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
The Guardian, The Independent, Daily Telegraph, Financial
Times, The Times, El Mundo, El País, Estado de Minas,
O Globo, and die Tageszeitung. Except for German newspaper
die Tageszeitung and Brazilian newspaper Estado de Minas,
the news outlets clustered in Group 4 are leading newspapers
within their respective countries and present a higher-than-
average volume of hard news articles. Figure 10 shows the 40
newspapers clustered into four groups according to the rela-
tive distribution of news articles per news section.
The results from the hierarchical clustering based on
squared Euclidean distances between the 40 news outlets
returned a dendrogram that clustered newspapers with high
volume of news articles dedicated to hard-news stories, such
as Politics, Opinion, Local, National, and World news. The
center of the dendrogram includes a much larger group of
newspapers that also covered hard-news topics, but which also
presented a higher volume of soft-news material. Figure 11
shows a circular dendrogram that clusters liberal news outlets
The Guardian and The New York Times, and proceeds includ-
ing newspapers with similar editorial profile, including The
Independent, Washington Post, and die Tageszeitung. The sub-
sequent clusters include leading British newspapers The Times
and Daily Telegraph, followed by leading Spanish and
Brazilian newspapers El País and O Globo.
Not surprisingly, Figure 11 shows business-oriented news
outlets Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal clus-
tered together (based on k-means and hierarchical clustering)
on the left part of Figure 11, and also Valor Econômico and
Financial Times Deutschland on the top of the circle. German
leading newspapers Die Zeit, Süddeutsche Zeitung, and
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung are also clustered together
on the top left of the ring. As expected, newspapers with a
high volume of infotainment and soft news content clustered
together at the lower-left portion of the circle, including
news outlets New York Post, Los Angeles Times, New York
Daily News, and Chicago Sun-Times. Daily Express, which
as previously mentioned presents a sensibly different edito-
rial style, but also newspapers with lower-than-average cir-
culation like Estado de Minas, Correio Braziliense, and
La Razón, fail to cluster with other newspapers and appear at
the end of the circle.
Hard and Soft News
We also performed a clustering analysis based on squared
Euclidean distances between the 21 news sections. We
expected the relative distance between news sections to be
consistent with the newsworthiness criteria that classify
news articles into hard and soft news. The cluster analysis
with k-means algorithm revealed a clear separation between
hard and soft news topics without the need for any hand cod-
ing. The cluster analysis returned the two groups shown in
Figure 12. The first group contains six sections and it clus-
tered the hard news topics Economy, Opinion, Politics, and
Local, National, and World news. The second group clus-
tered 15 soft news sections, including Arts, Cars, Crime,
Education, Entertainment, Environment, Fashion, Health,
Jobs, Lifestyle, Science, Sports, Technology, Tourism, and
Weather.
We also simulated the relationship between newspapers
and news sections as a bipartite predator­prey network with
two trophic levels (Figure 13). The lower level of the plot
shows the most tweeted sections in increasing order of
importance across countries, with Politics, National, World,
and Economy as the most popular sections among Twitter

on Euclidean distance) into four groups according to the relative

users in the five countries, followed by Sports, Local news,
Opinion pieces, Entertainment, and Arts. The upper level
indicates the predominance of news sections per country.
German newspapers present a higher-than-average volume
of news articles focusing on Politics and Economy; Brazilian
newspapers emphasize Sports and Politics; Spanish newspa-
pers show a significant volume of articles on Local and
National news, and American newspapers include a much
higher-than-average volume of messages on Entertainment.
Figure 14 draws a food web as a grid using a matrix of
news sections and newspapers. It shows three groups of
newspapers. The group on the right includes leading newspa-
pers within their respective countries, with a higher volume
of hard news articles but also a considerable volume of arti-
cles across the range of news sections. The group on the left
includes papers that emphasize soft news topics, and again
we observe the same news outlets clustered with the k-means
algorithm: Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, New
York Post, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today, The Sunday
Times, El Correo, La Vanguardia, Estado de S.Paulo, Jornal
do Commercio, and Zero Hora. The group in the middle
includes most of the German news outlets that presented a
higher-than-average volume of news articles on Politics and
Economy, but also an overall low volume of news items
altogether.
Conclusion
The results reported in this paper indicate that the ecosystem
of newsmaking is going through considerable changes.
Audiences now have the opportunity to express their agency,
not only as readers of texts but also as a fundamental piece
that decides which news articles are replicated and which
news sections gets the most attention across social network-
ing sites. This investigation sheds light into the transformed
architecture of journalism that increasingly relies on the par-
ticipation of audiences (Mitchelstein & Boczkowski, 2009)
and on the integration of multiple media ecosystems. We
have shown how the distribution of news articles and sec-
tions change across countries and whether traditional models
from print media endure in social networks.
The leading newspapers in their respective countries per-
formed better than average on Twitter, particularly El País in
Spain, The New York Times in the United States, Estado de
S.Paulo in Brazil, Süddeutsche Zeitung in Germany, and
Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom. We established that
the overall strategy of news outlets to relay links to news
articles on Twitter via website feeds is inefficient, as most
links remain singletons and likely unread. We also found that
news articles tweeted using mobile and desktop platforms
are much more likely to be replicated, and that countries with
a larger volume of news articles also present a larger volume
of mobile platform usage, though not necessarily a larger
user base. These results confirm that feedback to news items
from a large user base is pivotal for the replication of the
content across social networks.
While most newspapers investigated in this study pre-
sented a decline in the readership share in comparison with
their print circulation, the results also show that German and
Spanish readers are more likely to read multiple national
newspapers, and that British readers are more likely to resort
to foreign sources of news than their counterparts in Brazil,
United Kingdom, and United States. Contrary to previous
research, we found the concentration of links to news articles
posted by top users to be fairly low, as around a fifth of the
links to news articles that circulated on Twitter in the period
were posted by a large community of least-active users. The
results also show that news readership on Twitter replicates
the editorial profile of print publications, as new outlets are
clearly grouped according to their editorial profile. The dif-
ferences between broadsheet and tabloid inherited from leg-
acy media remain relatively unchanged in terms of content
shared on Twitter.
Consistent with previous research (Quandt, 2008), we
found that different national cultures place different weights
on news sections. Perhaps confirming and conflicting with
the perceived stereotypes of nationalities reported in public
opinion research (Prothro, 1954; Reigrotski & Anderson,
1959), German readers placed greater emphasis on Politics
and Economy; Brazilians on Sports and Arts; Spaniards on
Local and National news; Britons and Americans on Opinion
and World news. On the other hand, and perhaps further
accentuating positive and negative cultural stereotypes
reported in social psychology literature (Cuddy et al., 2009;
Jonas & Hewstone, 1986; Katz & Braly, 1933), Americans
placed less emphasis on Economy and Arts; Britons on
Politics and Local news; Spaniards on Sports and Politics;
Brazilians on Opinion items and World news; and Germans
on National and World news.

ordination axes indicating the total variation found in the dataset.

Finally, the methodology and the results presented in
this paper are only possible due to the recent availability
of social network data. Twitter in particular and social net-
works in general provide avenues for quantitative research
at unprecedented scales. The understanding of which
news sections of newspapers are the most and least read
by readers in different parts of the world was until recently
very restricted due to scanty data. Social media data not
only allowed for this novel approach, but also likely
changed the circulation and access to news items. We
expect the availability of social network to data to support
new lines of research inquiry and novel research methods
designed to explore the networked architecture of online
journalism.
