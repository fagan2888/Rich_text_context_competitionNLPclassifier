Abstract
Background: The physical impairments that affect participation in life roles among older adults have not been identified. Using the International
Classification of Functioning Disability and Health as a conceptual framework, we aimed to determine the leg and trunk impairments that
predict participation over 2 years, both directly and indirectly through mediation by changes in activities.
Methods: We analyzed 2 years of data from the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly, a cohort study of 430 primary care
patients with self-reported mobility limitation (mean age 77 years; 68% female; average of four chronic conditions). Frequency of and limitations
in participation were examined using the Late-Life Disability Instrument. Baseline physical impairments included: leg strength, leg speed of
movement, knee range of motion (ROM), ankle ROM, leg strength asymmetry, kyphosis, and trunk extensor endurance. Structural equation
modeling with latent growth curve analysis was used to identify the impairments that predicted participation at year 2, mediated by changes in
activities. Models were adjusted for baseline participation, age, and gender.
Results: Leg speed and ankle ROM directly influenced participation in life roles during follow-up (direct = 1.39­4.53 and 4.70, respectively).
Additionally, ankle ROM and trunk extensor endurance contributed indirectly to participation score at follow-up via effects on changes in
activities (indirect = -1.06 to -4.24 and 1.01 to 4.18, respectively).
Conclusions: Leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk extensor endurance are key physical impairments predicting participation in life roles in older
adults. These results have implications for the development of exercise interventions to enhance participation.
Key Words: Disablement--Disability evaluation--Geriatric assessment--Social participation--Rehabilitation
Participation is recognized as a key component of health associ-
ated with successful aging and with survival (1,2). Defined as a per-
son's involvement in life situations, participation is one of the three
main components in the World Health Organization's International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (3). Up to
52% of adults aged above 50 years have restrictions in participa-
tion and this number increases with age (4). Importantly, participa-
tion restrictions represent the broad impact of health on people's
lives; a concept more meaningful to individuals than problems in
performing basic physical tasks and activities (5)--areas that have
traditionally been emphasized in both geriatric care and gerontologi-
cal research.
Within the ICF framework, participation is described as result-
ing from the complex interaction between a health condition or
disease, body functions, and structures (anatomic and physiologic
functioning of organs and body systems), activities (execution of
664 Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 5
actions by an individual), and personal and environmental factors
(3). Examples of participation include involvement in home or com-
munity life such as taking care of the home or taking part in active
recreation, while the activity domain includes discrete physical tasks
such as walking and getting up from a chair. The ICF thus provides
a useful framework for studying critical health outcomes and their
determinants. Despite its recognized importance, gaps in evidence
on the determinants of participation hinder efforts for disability
prevention among older adults. While medical, demographic, and
socioeconomic factors as well as some aspects of physical function
have been shown to be associated with participation in prior work
(6­11), less attention has been paid to the physical impairments
at the body functions and structures level that may influence par-
ticipation. This is important for informing evidence-based exercise
interventions targeting the impairments most critical for participa-
tion in life roles among older adults. Although it is well established
that exercise-based interventions improve activity limitations, evi-
dence that exercise can improve participation is mixed (12,13). In
part, this may be due to the lack of understanding of the specific
impairments that underlie participation and can be targeted as part
of interventions. To date, most exercise studies of older adults have
emphasized leg strength and aerobic capacity (14,15); it is possible
that interventions targeting other physical impairments would have
greater effects.
The Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly
(Boston RISE) is a prospective cohort study of older primary care
patients with the specific aim of identifying the physical impairments
amenable to rehabilitation that are most relevant for activities and
participation (16). The primary aim of this analysis of Boston RISE
is to investigate the most important leg and trunk impairments that
predict an older adult's subsequent level of participation at 2 years.
This information is critical for informing evidence-based exercise
interventions to enhance participation in life roles among older
adults. In addition, although the ICF is widely accepted as a frame-
work for describing factors that influence the disablement process,
little empirical evidence exists confirming the pathways between
impairments, activities, and participation. Prior work has shown
that both impairments and activities affect participation; however,
the limited work evaluating the interplay among these constructs
suggests that the main influence of impairments is through an inter-
mediary effect on activities which in turn, has a direct impact on
participation (8,17). Therefore, our secondary aim is to determine
whether changes in activities mediate the impact of leg and trunk
impairments on participation over 2 years. Our structural model
of disability tested the following hypotheses: (i) baseline leg and
trunk impairments will be identified that predict participation at
year 2, both directly and indirectly through changes in activities and
(ii) there is a direct relationship between changes in activities over
2 years and participation at year 2. A conceptual model illustrating
these relationships is provided in Figure 1.
Methods
Design and Participants
We analyzed 2 years of follow-up data from Boston RISE, a cohort
study of 430 older adults. The study was approved by the relevant
Institutional Review Boards and all participants provided written
informed consent. Details of the methods have been described previ-
ously (16). Briefly, primary care patients in the Greater Boston Area
who met the following criteria were recruited: age 65 years, abil-
ity to communicate in English, self-reported difficulty or task modi-
fication walking ½ mile and/or climbing stairs, no planned major
surgery, and expectation of remaining in the area. Exclusion crite-
ria comprised: significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hyper-
tension, lower-extremity amputation, use of supplemental oxygen,
myocardial infarction or major surgery in the previous 6 months,
Mini-Mental State Exam score <18 and Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB) score <4. Baseline assessments were conducted dur-
ing an initial screening visit and a subsequent visit within 2 weeks.
Follow-up assessments were conducted at 12 and 24 months.
Measures
Physical Impairments
Five categories of physical impairments were evaluated in Boston
RISE: strength, speed of movement, range of motion (ROM), asym-
metry, and trunk stability. This analysis focused on the following
Figure 1. Conceptual model for the hypothesized relationships between physical impairments, activities, and participation.The solid arrow represents the direct
effect of the impairment on participation and the dotted arrow represents the indirect effect mediated by activities.
Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 5 665
leg and trunk impairments selected from each category based on
their association with mobility activities shown previously (18): leg
strength, leg speed, knee flexion ROM, ankle ROM, leg strength
asymmetry, kyphosis, and trunk extensor endurance.
Participants underwent physical impairment testing during the
second baseline visit; all measures were collected by a trained assessor
using a standardized protocol.Assessment sessions lasted 2 hours and
participants were permitted to rest as needed. Leg strength was the
maximum value obtained from either leg using a 1-repetition maxi-
mum test on a Keiser A420 pneumatic leg press machine. Leg speed
was calculated by dividing peak leg press power by the concurrently
recorded force obtained from a single leg press repetition pushing
out as quickly as possible (18). Knee and ankle ROM were measured
with a goniometer. Ankle ROM was defined as intact or impaired
based on dorsiflexion less than 90° or plantarflexion less than 20°.
Strength asymmetry was calculated by dividing the higher leg strength
value from the two sides by the lower strength value. Trunk extensor
endurance was assessed by recording the time a participant was able
to maintain a neutral trunk position with their lower body supported
on a specialized plinth leaning forward at a 45° angle (19). Kyphosis
was measured using a validated flexible ruler technique (20).
Activities
Activities were assessed using the advanced lower-extremity scale
of the Late-Life Function Instrument (LLFI) (21). The LLFI assesses
a broad range of activity limitations, consistent with the ICF model.
Participants are asked to report their current degree of difficulty in
performing 32 physical activities on a typical day without the help of
someone else and without the use of assistive devices. Response options
include: none, a little, some, quite a lot, and cannot do. The advanced
lower-extremity function scale includes activities involving a significant
degree of physical ability and endurance such as walking several blocks
and climbing a flight of stairs without a handrail.The scale is calibrated
from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates poor function and 100 indicates good
function. Evidence supports the validity, reliability, and responsiveness
of the LLFI in community-dwelling older adults (21­23).
The SPPB (24) was used as a secondary measure of activity in
order to identify any additional physical impairments that might
affect participation through a performance-based test of basic lower-
extremity mobility.
Participation
Participation was assessed with the Late-Life Disability Instrument
(LLDI) that measures both frequency of participation in 16 major
life tasks and limitations in capability to perform each task consistent
with the ICF model (25). Frequency dimension questions ask, "How
often do you" do a specific task while limitation dimension ques-
tions ask "To what extent do you feel limited" in doing the task.
Questionnaire items encompass a wide variety of participation tasks
including: personal care; mobility and travel; exchange of informa-
tion; social, community, and civic activities; home life; paid or vol-
unteer work; and involvement in economic activities. Raw scores for
each dimension are transformed to scaled scores from 0 to 100 with
higher scores indicating a greater level of participation. The LLDI has
strong construct validity and reliability, and is predictive of poor self-
rated health, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits (23,25,26).
Statistical Analysis
We used structural equation modeling based on latent growth curve
analysis to determine the baseline leg and trunk impairments that
predicted participation directly at year 2, and indirectly through
their effect on changes in activities (Figure 1). Two-step procedures
were used to build the models. First, we used the unconditional latent
growth model to describe the change in activity across the three time-
points (baseline, year 1, and year 2). Second, we used a series of media-
tion models to examine whether change in activities would mediate
the impact of the physical impairment on participation. To facilitate
interpretation, the impairments were dichotomized using the median
as the cut-point; this approach also yielded the best model fit. Results
are presented in terms of performance on the physical impairment
test above the median (ie, less impairment). For each physical impair-
ment, the mediation effect was calculated as the product of the impact
of that impairment on change in activities and the impact of change
in activities on the participation outcome. Based on 5,000 bootstrap
samples, the bias-corrected confidence interval was used to determine
the statistical significance of the mediation effect. A mediation (indi-
rect) effect was established if the 95% confidence interval did not
include 0, indicating that change in activity mediates the impact of the
impairment on participation. Models were adjusted for age, gender,
and baseline level of participation. An effect size (ES) estimate for the
impairments that predicted participation was calculated as ES = /SD;
where  is the direct/indirect coefficient for the impairment and SD is
the standard deviation of the participation score at year 2. As a sensi-
tivity analysis to examine the effect of missing data for the entire sam-
ple (n = 430), we applied two-stage maximum likelihood estimation
(27): in the first stage, we estimated the saturated mean and covariance
matrix of the observed variables based on the expectation­maximiza-
tion algorithm. In the second stage, the mediation model parameters
were estimated based on the saturated mean and covariance matrix
generated from the first stage; the bias-corrected bootstrap method
was used to create the confidence intervals (CIs) (28).
Overall model fit was examined using the chi-square test (non-
significant p value indicates good model fit), comparative fit index
(CFI) and Tucker Lewis index (TLI) (values >0.95 indicate accept-
able fit), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA;
values <0.05 indicate good model fit). Maximum likelihood estima-
tion implemented in MPlus was used in the analysis.
Results
Participants' baseline characteristics and values for the leg and trunk
impairments are provided in Table 1. Demographics were consistent
with census data for older adults living in the recruitment area. At
baseline, 430 Boston RISE participants had a mean age of 76.6 years,
68% were female and 82.6% were white. At 2 years, 366 participants
remained in the study; 15 were deceased, 17 withdrew due to medical
reasons and 32 withdrew due to non-health reasons or were lost to
follow-up. Over 2 years, the mean change in activities measured by the
LLFI was -3.23
±
10.26 points; the mean change in SPPB score was
0.53
±
1.77. At 2 years, mean participation scores were 51.12
±
6.27
for the LLDI frequency scale and 69.11±13.84 for limitation.
The direct and indirect effect coefficients and 95% CI for the leg
and trunk impairments that predicted frequency of and limitations
in participation are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Positive
coefficients indicate a positive relationship between the physical
impairment and subsequent participation; that is, better scores on
the physical impairment tests predict higher participation in life
roles. Specifically, the interpretation of  is the expected change in
participation score associated with baseline performance above the
median on the physical impairment test when holding all other model
parameters constant. Both the participation frequency and limitation
666 Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 5
models met criteria for good model fit. For participation frequency
2 (df = 13) = 13.98, p = .3753; CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.997; and
RMSEA = 0.015. For participation limitation 2 (df = 13) = 12.834,
p = .4607; CFI = 1; TLI = 1; and RMSEA = 0.
Participation Frequency Model
Change in activities measured with the LLFI had a significant
direct effect on frequency of participation in life roles (standardized
 = 2.19). Leg speed was the only physical impairment that had a
direct effect on frequency of participation at year 2 (direct = 1.39,
ES = 0.22) (Table 2). Ankle ROM (indirect = -1.06, ES = -0.17)
and trunk extensor endurance (indirect = 1.01, ES = 0.16) had indi-
rect effects on frequency of participation acting though changes in
activities.
Participation Limitation Model
Change in activities measured with the LLFI had a significant direct
effect on limitations in participation in life roles (standardized
 = 8.43). Leg speed (direct = 4.53, ES = 0.32) and ankle ROM
(direct 4.70, ES = 0.34) both had a direct effect on limitations in
participation at year 2. Ankle ROM (indirect = -4.24, ES = -0.31)
and trunk extensor endurance (indirect = 4.18, ES = 0.30) had indi-
rect effects on limitations in participation acting though changes in
activities.
Models Using SPPB
In the models in which the LLFI was replaced with the SPPB for the
activity measure, trunk extensor endurance had a significant indirect
effect (indirect = 6.0, 95% CI 0.91­20.67, ES = 0.43) on limitations
in participation mediated by changes in the SPPB. No other physical
impairments contributed to participation acting through the SPPB.
Change in the SPPB had a direct effect on limitations in participa-
tion ( = 0.17, 95% CI 0.06­0.46) but no effect on participation
frequency.
Sensitivity Analysis
In the models using maximum likelihood estimation for missing
data, the same physical impairments predicted participation fre-
quency and limitations, with the exception of ankle ROM, which
did not predict either dimension of participation.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the specific leg
and trunk impairments amenable to treatment that are most predic-
tive of an older person's participation in major life roles. Our results
identified leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk extensor endurance as
key physical impairments predicting participation levels both directly
and indirectly through changes in activities over 2 years of follow-
up. In addition, these results validate a clinically relevant model of
disablement with implications for late-life disability prevention.
Further understanding of the factors underlying the disablement
process has been highlighted as a key research priority in geriatric
rehabilitation (29). Despite widespread acceptance of the ICF as a
framework for studying health and disability, there is scarce empiri-
cal evidence confirming the associations between impairments,

activities and participation. Our results support the hypotheses
proposed in our conceptual model (Figure 1) and demonstrate that
leg and trunk impairments have both a direct and indirect influence
on subsequent participation in life roles acting through changes in
activities. These data add to previous work on the disablement pro-
cess (8,17) and provide a framework through which interventions to
enhance participation can be identified. This is particularly impor-
tant given the limited evidence demonstrating that exercise has a
beneficial impact on participation in life roles (12,13,30).
A recent statement from the Australian and New Zealand Society
for Geriatric Medicine (31) emphasized the need for research to
determine the most effective types of exercise to optimize outcomes
in older adults. There are two major trials to date showing that
exercise in older adults can prevent or delay the onset of limitations
in activities of daily living (15) and walking ability (14), respec-
tively: the Fitness Arthritis and Seniors Trial (15) and the Lifestyle
Interventions and Independence for Elders Study (14). Common
to both studies is exercise focusing primarily on improving aero-
bic capacity and muscle strength. The current analysis from Boston
RISE makes two important contributions that have the potential to
inform future exercise trials: (i) we consider a comprehensive set of
leg and trunk impairments linked to mobility status and (ii) we iden-
tify their impact on participation in life roles- a broader disability
outcome of significance to individuals (5). Our results suggest that if
the goal is to have an impact on participation, leg speed, ankle ROM,
and trunk endurance are specific physical impairments that could be
targeted to maximize the benefits of exercise for older adults.
It is interesting to note that leg speed had a direct effect on both
frequency of participation in life roles and perceived limitations in
participation. There is increasing literature documenting the impor-
tance of leg speed as a predictor of walking ability and other activity
outcomes (32­35); however, ours is the first study to demonstrate its
prospective association with participation, a global disability out-
come. Given that leg speed was directly associated with participa-
tion, exercises aimed at increasing the speed generating capacity of
the muscle (eg, repeated chair-stands where the patient is asked to
stand up as quickly as possible) might have a positive impact on
participation in life roles. While there is preliminary evidence dem-
onstrating the potential of task-specific training emphasizing speed
of movement for improving activity limitations (36), there is a need
to evaluate exercise directly targeting this attribute as part of inter-
ventions designed to enhance participation in older adults.
Trunk extensor endurance had a consistent indirect effect on
subsequent participation in life roles acting through changes in
self-reported activities. It was also the only neuromuscular attrib-
ute to have an effect on participation acting through changes in a
performance-based measure of activity (the SPPB). A hypothesized
mechanism through which trunk endurance may influence participa-
tion is through its association with balance (34)--a complex skill
required for daily living to avoid falls. Trunk endurance is likely
critical for supporting activities requiring a higher degree of balance
control which in turn, may have a significant impact on participation
in life roles. This theory is supported by a recent meta-analysis which
found that exercise interventions designed to reduce falls--many of
which included balance exercises challenging trunk stability--had a
small effect on participation in life roles (12). Regardless of the spe-
cific mechanism, our results suggest that activity-specific functional
training with an emphasis on tasks that require trunk endurance
might have a positive impact on participation.
Although the direct effect of ankle ROM on participation was
positive, its indirect effect mediated by changes in activity was nega-
tive. This is a reflection of the negative association between baseline
ankle ROM and change in activities; those with impaired ankle ROM
at baseline showed greater improvement in activities over 2 years
than those with intact ROM. These patients may have had more
room to improve and possibly underwent rehabilitation. Further
research is necessary to confirm this theory; however, the positive
direct effect on participation limitation nevertheless highlights ankle
ROM as another understudied target for geriatric research.
A unique strength of our analysis is that we evaluated two key
dimensions of participation: frequency of and limitations in partici-
pation in major life roles. Although leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk
endurance had modest effects on both participation dimensions, the
magnitude of their effect was greatest on limitations in participa-
tion. Of note, changes in advanced lower-extremity activities had
an almost fourfold greater influence on limitations in participation
than on frequency of participation. In addition, the SPPB, reflecting
a more basic measure of activity, had no effect on participation fre-
quency. These results extend prior work which showed differences
in the responsiveness and predictive value of the LLDI limitation
and frequency dimensions in older adults (26), and point to the need
for further understanding of the myriad of other potential factors
that might underlie the different dimensions of participation (11).
This is particularly important for frequency of participation given
its association with adverse outcomes such as hospitalizations and
emergency room visits (26) and its tendency to show less improve-
ment following interventions (23).
A limitation of this study is that our findings may not be gen-
eralizable to primary care patients living outside the Boston area.
However, the participation scores in Boston RISE are similar to
those of the LLDI development study (25), which included a more
general sample of community-dwelling older adults. A small propor-
tion of participants were unable to complete all the baseline impair-
ment tests and, although loss to follow-up was low (16%), there

were some missing outcome data at the 2-year assessment. Our sen-
sitivity analysis using two-stage maximum likelihood estimation to
account for both missing data and attrition suggested this had little
impact on our findings, with the exception of ankle ROM, which
was not retained as a predictor of participation. This finding along
with our observation of a negative indirect effect of ankle ROM on
participation warrant further investigation. Although patients with
severe cognitive impairment were excluded from Boston RISE, it
is unclear the extent to which error may have been introduced in
the self-report measures by those with milder cognitive impairment.
Finally, the Boston RISE study did not include a direct measure of
aerobic capacity or a comprehensive evaluation of upper extremity
impairments; further research is required to evaluate their impact
on participation.
In summary, our results demonstrating the relationships between
trunk and lower-extremity physical impairments, activities, and par-
ticipation validate a conceptual model of disability in older adults
that highlights opportunities for geriatric research and practice. In
particular, we have shown that leg speed, ankle ROM, and trunk
extensor endurance have direct and indirect effects on participa-
tion--a key component of health. Investigation of interventions
for enhancing participation in life roles among older adults should
include task-specific exercise emphasizing trunk stability and train-
ing directly targeting leg speed and ankle ROM.
