ABSTRACT We evaluated the distribution and abundance of feral honey bee, Apis mellifera L.,
colonies in a coastal prairie landscape by examining nest site characteristics, population trends, and
spatial and temporal patterns in cavity use. The colony densities of up to 12.5 colonies per km2 were
the highest reported in the literature for an area including both suitable and unsuitable patches of
nesting habitat. The measured cavity attributes were similar to those reported from other areas. The
time occupied and turnover indices provided useful information about cavity quality, although none
of the measured cavity attributes were correlated with these indices. Unmeasurable cavity charac-
teristics, such as cavity volume, may provide a better estimate of cavity quality. Spatial patterns existed
in cavity use by the feral colonies, with the colonies showing an aggregated pattern of distribution
throughout the study. Colony aggregations probably resulted from the distribution of resources,
especially cavities. Two years after the arrival of Africanized honey bees, cavities used by Africanized
and European colonies were aggregated in distribution. During what seemed to be a transition period,
both Africanized and European colonies were randomly distributed. After that time, European
colonies remained randomly distributed, whereas Africanized colonies were aggregated. Therefore,
the invasion of Africanized honey bees seemed to fragment the existing European population,
corresponding to a decrease in the overall number of European colonies in the study area.

ber of adults in a colony (Seeley 1985, Winston 1987).
Entrance size and orientation inßuence colony ther-
moregulation (Szabo 1983), whereas entrance size,
height, and number inßuence a colonyÕs ability to
defend the nest against predators (Seeley 1985).
Other factors, such as cavity exposure and visibility,
also inßuence cavity quality for feral colonies (Win-
ston 1987).
Several studies have identiÞed and described the
locations of feral honey bee colonies (Seeley and
Morse 1976; Avitabile et al. 1978; Taber 1979; Visscher
andSeeley1982;BorehamandRoubik1987;Schneider
and Blyther 1988; Wenner 1989; Gambino et al. 1990;
Morse et al. 1990; Schneider 1990; Ratnieks et al. 1991;
Oldroydetal.1994,1995,1997;McNallyandSchneider
1996). Many have simply estimated the density of feral
colonies, whereas others have examined structural
attributes of nest sites. However, few studies have
evaluated spatial patterns of cavity use (Oldroyd et al.
1995, 1997; McNally and Schneider 1996), and no stud-
ies have evaluated spatial patterns through time.
Cavity selection by feral colonies has important
implications for the dispersal of Africanized honey
bees. Understanding nest site selection and the pop-
ulation ecology of feral colonies also provides insight
into how Africanized honey bees will impact agricul-
tural and beekeeping practices (McNally and Schnei-
der 1996). Africanized honey bees, hybrids between
European and African, Apis mellifera scutellata (Lepe-
letier), honey bees (Clarke et al. 2002, Pinto et al.
2005), Þrst arrived in the United States in 1990
(Hunter et al. 1993, Rubink et al. 1996). For the pur-
poses of this study, European refers to the existing
honey bee population in the United States before the
arrival of Africanized honey bees. The background
population consisted of a variety of subspecies of A.
mellifera, mostly from Europe (Sheppard 1989a, b).
The goal of this study was to evaluate spatial and
temporal patterns in the distribution and abundance

of feral honey bee colonies in a coastal prairie land-
scape by examining nest site characteristics, popula-
tion trends, and cavity use. We studied feral colonies
on the Welder Wildlife Refuge (San Patricio County,
TX) over an 8-yr period, during which Africanized
honey bees arrived and became established in the
area. SpeciÞc objectives were 1) to compare the den-
sity of feral colonies in this study with densities re-
portedintheliterature,2)toevaluatecavitysuitability
for feral honey bees based on structural and environ-
mental attributes of the cavities, 3) to compare the
structural and environmental attributes of cavities oc-
cupied only by Africanized or only by European col-
onies, 4) to examine spatial and temporal patterns in
cavity use by the feral colonies, and 5) to examine the
spatial and temporal distribution of Africanized and
European colonies.
Materials and Methods
Study Site Description. The study site was located
on the Welder Wildlife Refuge (San Patricio County,
Texas), where Africanized honey bees were Þrst re-
corded in 1993 (Pinto et al. 2004). The study area
consisted of 6.25 km2 of coastal prairie located in the
western one-quarter of the refuge. The landscape was
dominatedbyfourvegetationcommunitiesthatvaried
in the availability of important resources necessary for
the survival, growth, and reproduction of feral colo-
nies (Baum 2003). Cavities were abundant in the live
oak and riparian woodland habitat patches but scarce
in the brushland and grassland habitat patches. The
distribution and abundance of food resources ßuctu-
ated throughout the year, with the live oak and brush-
land habitat patches providing the best overall sources
of pollen and nectar. However, the grassland habitat
patches were an important source of pollen and nectar
during the winter (Baum 2003, Baum et al. 2004).
Colony Density. The study area was surveyed for
feral honey bee colonies between 1993 and 2000. Sur-
veys were conducted by evaluating the status of cav-
ities identiÞed during previous surveys to contain feral
honey bees. We also searched for new cavities and
colonies by inspecting all trees within the study area
for honey bees (foragers leaving or returning to a
colony) during periods of high honey bee activity.
During this 8-yr period, 109 cavities containing a feral
colony during at least one survey were identiÞed. The
density of feral colonies per square kilometer during
each year was calculated based on yearly cavity sur-
veys. The presence (active cavity) or absence (inac-
tive cavity) of feral colonies in the identiÞed cavities
was recorded. Cavities were often surveyed multiple
times during any given year, so the status (active or
inactive) of each cavity during the survey from each
year with the most active cavities was used for the
calculations. The number of cavities surveyed in-
creased through time as new cavities used by feral
honey bee colonies were found. Densities are re-
ported from 1993 through 2000, although densities
before 1995 are probably underestimated because
30% of the cavities surveyed were found by then.
Cavity Attributes. Most of the feral colonies in the
study area were located in tree cavities. Therefore, we
collected detailed measurements for each cavity, in-
cluding number of entrances, entrance orientation,
entrance size, cavity height, tree species, tree diam-
eter at breast height (dbh), tree height, basal area,
canopy closure, ground cover, habitat type, and motte
size.Mottesareclustersofwoodyvegetationthatform
around a nucleus (in this case a live oak tree, Quercus
virginiana P. Miller) and may eventually expand and
coalesce into a contiguous area of woody vegetation.
Entrance number and tree species were obtained by
visual inspection. Entrance orientation was recorded
using a compass. The width and height of each cavity
entrance were measured with a tape measure or es-
timated in centimeters when it was not possible to
reach the cavity entrance. Entrance width and height
were then converted into entrance area based on the
area of an ellipse. Cavity height was measured in m
from ground level by using a tape measure or visually
estimated for high cavities. The dbh was calculated in
centimeters by using a Spencer Original LoggersTape.
Tree height was recorded in meters by using a Suunto
clinometer with 15- and 20-m scales. Basal area was
obtained using the Þve-factor option of a JIM-GEM
Cruz-All. Canopy closure and ground cover (sepa-
rated into monocot and dicot) were estimated at 10 m
from the cavity tree in the four Cardinal directions.
Estimates of percentage of cover were made by look-
ing through a 5-cm-diameter by 10.5-cm-long hollow
tube divided into four quadrants. Percentage of can-
opy closure and ground cover were averaged across all
directions to obtain an overall value for each cavity
tree. Habitat type was identiÞed from a landscape
classiÞcation of the study area based on vegetation
communities, and motte size was obtained from a
spatial database of the study area with a resolution of
0.25 m (Baum 2003). The boundaries of each live oak
motte were digitized in ArcView GIS 3.2, and the area
of the resulting polygons was calculated using an ex-
tension (area calculation for polygon) in ArcView GIS
3.2.Mottesizewasonlymeasuredforliveoaksbecause
none of the other cavity tree species formed distinct
mottes.
Cavity characteristics were evaluated in terms of
time occupied and turnover indices calculated for
each cavity. Time occupied refers to the proportion of
the time surveyed that a cavity was active, whereas
turnover reßects the number of changes in cavity
status from active to inactive or inactive to active
during consecutive surveys. Therefore, these indices
provide an estimate of cavity quality based on honey
bee use. Only cavities identiÞed by 1995 were in-
cluded in the analyses because the values for cavities
surveyed only a few times may be biased, and 80% of
cavities had been found by then. For example, a cavity
surveyed only once (Þrst identiÞed during the most
recent survey) would be occupied 100% of the time
with 0% turnover.
Spatial and Temporal Patterns. The spatial coordi-
nates for each cavity tree used by feral colonies during
the 8-yr study period were recorded to a submeter

and TSC1 Asset Surveyor data logger. When cavities
were located in areas with dense canopy cover, an
Advantage Laser RangeÞnder was used to calculate
the offset from the cavity to where spatial coordinates
were obtained.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Analysis. mtDNA is
maternally inherited and does not recombine during
sexual reproduction, passing directly from queen to
offspring. Thus, mtDNA provides a historical perspec-
tive on the invasion of Africanized honey bees, high-
lighting what happened to the existing and invading
colonies and their subsequent offspring (Schneider et
al. 2004). Within our study site, the pattern of mtDNA
is closely followed by the nuclear pattern (Pinto et al.
2005), suggesting that mtDNA also may reßect what
happened at the nuclear level (Pinto et al. 2005).
However, mtDNA only represents the maternal side
of the Africanization process, and nuclear DNA may
provide additional insights into the invasion process
that were not available for this study (Schneider et al.
2004). Honey bee samples for mtDNA analysis were
collected from colonies from any cavity active at any-
time throughout the year (Pinto et al. 2004). There-
fore, sample sizes differ from those used to calculate
colony density. After extraction of total DNA from the
thorax of a single adult worker per colony, as detailed
in Pinto et al. (2004), a 485-bp section of the cyto-
chrome b gene (Crozier et al. 1991) was ampliÞed in
a 5-l total volume containing 0.5 TaqDNA poly-
merase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 1.5 mM
MgCl2
, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 2 pM of each primer,
0.5 l of template DNA, and 0.25 U of TaqDNA poly-
merase (Promega). The polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) temperature proÞle was 94C for 3 min fol-
lowed by 30 cycles of 94C for 15 s, 50C for 15 s, and
68C for 5 s. After the Þnal cycle, an additional 10 min
at 72C was performed. After PCR, samples were di-
gested with the restriction enzyme BglII by using the
temperature and buffer conditions recommended by
the supplier. The total digestion volume was then
electrophoresed on a 2% agarose/Tris borate-EDTA
gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized
under UV light. Based on the visualization of a one-
band pattern or two-band pattern on the gel, the type
of mtDNA (mitotype) was scored as A. m. scutellata
(referred to as Africanized throughout this article) or
non-A. m. scutellata (referred to as European through-
out this article; Pinto et al. 2003).
Statistical Analyses. We used a Spearman rank cor-
relation coefÞcient to identify cavity characteristics
correlated with the time occupied and turnover indi-
ces. A 2 test applied to circular distributions
(Batschelet 1965) was used to examine whether there
were any patterns in entrance orientation, by using
eight groups at equal intervals. We used a KruskalÐ
Wallis test to compare the time occupied and turnover
indices between habitat types. A MannÐWhitney U
test was performed to compare cavity characteristics
between cavities used only by Africanized and only by
European honey bee colonies (Sokal and Rohlf 1995,
SAS Institute 1998).
We used a nearest neighbor analysis to compare
observed patterns of cavity occupancy with those ex-
pected by chance. The nearest neighbor index (NNI)
was calculated by comparing the mean observed near-
est neighbor distance with the mean expected nearest
neighbor distance for spatially random points (Clark
and Evans 1954). We used CrimeStat version 2.0 (Le-
vine 2002) for the calculations. Values close to 1.0
indicate observed average distances do not differ from
random,whereasvalues1.0indicateaggregationand
values 1.0 indicate dispersion. A Z test was used to
identify signiÞcant values of the NNI. We performed
the nearest neighbor analysis for all occupied colonies
and then separately for Africanized and European
colonies.
Results
Colony Density and Cavity Attributes. Colony den-
sity ranged from 3.8 to 12.5 colonies per km2 from 1995
through 2000 (Table 1). Densities were lowest in 1993
and 1996 and highest in 1995 and 2000. Cavities used
by feral colonies were located in live oak (Q. virgini-
ana; n  93), hackberry (Celtis spp.; n  8), anacua

cavities. Honey bee samples for mtDNA analysis were collected from colonies from any cavity active at anytime throughout the year (Pinto
et al. 2004), so sample sizes differ from those used to calculate colony density.

naeus;n1)trees.Cavityentranceheightvariedfrom
ground level to 7.6 m (Table 2). Most cavities only had
one entrance, although 12 cavities had two to Þve
entrances. The entrances of cavities used by feral
colonies most often faced the northeastern and south-
western directions and differed signiÞcantly from ran-
dom (2  16.92, df  7, P  0.018). Entrance size was
extremely variable but on average was 42.10 cm2 (Ta-
ble 2). The dense live oak habitat patches contained
56 cavities (51%), the open live oak habitat patches
contained 36 cavities (33%), the woodland habitat
patches contained 16 cavities (15%), and the brush-
landÐgrassland habitat patches contained only one
cavity (1%; Fig. 1).
Nine cavities were occupied for 80% of the sur-
veys (Fig. 2). Five cavities were occupied only during
the survey in which they were Þrst found. Turnover
was relatively low, ranging from 5 to 30% of surveys.
However, no cavities were occupied continuously
throughout the surveys (Fig. 3).
None of the measured cavity characteristics was
signiÞcantly correlated with the time occupied or
turnover indices (P  0.082). None of the measured
cavity site characteristics was signiÞcantly different
between cavities only used by Africanized colonies
and only used by European colonies (P  0.140).
Spatial and Temporal Patterns. Occupied cavities
were aggregated in distribution for all years examined
(Table 1). An analysis of spatial patterns by mitotype
yielded different results (Table 3). The Þrst colony of
A. m. scutellata maternal descent (Africanized honey
bee colony) in the study area was identiÞed in 1993.
At that time, colonies of non-A. m. scutellata maternal
origin (European honey bee colonies) were aggre-
gated in distribution. In 1994, three Africanized col-
onies were found and European colonies were aggre-
gated in distribution. The distributions of European
and Africanized colonies were aggregated in 1995,
when 82.7% of the colonies were European. In 1996,
there were equal numbers of European and African-
ized colonies, both with aggregated distributions. By
1997, 62.9% of the colonies were Africanized, and both
European and Africanized colonies were randomly
distributed. From 1998 through 2000, 73.7, 80.3, and
80.3% of colonies were Africanized. For each of these
years, the distribution of Africanized honey bee col-
onies was aggregated and the distribution of European
honey bee colonies was random (Table 3).
Discussion
Colony Density. The densities of up to 12.5 colonies
per km2 observed for this study were the highest
reported to date for an area including both suitable
and unsuitable patches of nesting habitat (see review
of colony density in Table 1 of Ratnieks et al. 1991, as
well as more recent data in Oldroyd et al. 1994, 1997
and McNally and Schneider 1996). The live oak and
riparian woodland habitat patches were the only areas
providing suitable cavities, and these habitat patches
comprised 44% of the study area (Fig. 1). Oldroyd et
al. (1994) reported a density of 77.1 colonies per km2
but only considered a narrow swath of suitable nesting
habitat 100 m in width. When considering a square
area (1 km by 1 km), the density is actually 7.71
colonies per km2, with suitable habitat comprising
only 10% of the total area. Data reported in Kerr
(1971) were omitted for similar reasons (Ratnieks et
al. 1991) and because detailed information was not
available to convert the data to a comparable format.
Based on these considerations, the previously re-
ported highest densities were 7.8 (Schneider and
Blyther 1988), 7.7 (Oldroyd et al. 1994), and 7.1 (Bore-
ham and Roubik 1987) colonies per km2. Therefore,
the highest density reported for this study is higher
than previously reported densities of feral colonies.
In general, the study area represents highly suitable
habitat for feral honey bee colonies. Cavity density is
highincertainareas,andpollenandnectarsourcesare
abundant throughout most of the year (Baum 2003,
Baum et al. 2004). Conservative estimates of annual
pollen and nectar production for plants in the study
area based on abundance and growth form suggest
that 1,895 feral colonies could be supported by pollen
sources and 244 feral colonies could be supported by
nectar sources within the study area, based on the
annual resource requirements of a typical feral colony
(Baum 2003). These estimates increase to 3,161 feral
colonies for pollen sources and 407 feral colonies for
nectar sources when the area is expanded beyond the
study site boundaries to include the entire potential
foraging range of the feral colonies, based on the
spatial locations of cavities and a foraging radius of
800 m (Baum 2003). The densities reported in this
study are high for natural areas (Ratnieks et al. 1991,
Oldroyd et al. 1994, McNally and Schneider 1996).
High densities also may occur in urban landscapes
where honey bee colonies nest in human made struc-
tures and landscaping practices provide pollen and
nectar during natural periods of resource dearth
(K.A.B, M. D. Tchakerian, S. C. Thoenes, and R.N.C.,
unpublished data).
Cavity Attributes. The most common tree genus
used by feral colonies in this study, Quercus, also was
frequently used in other areas (Seeley and Morse
1976, Avitabile et al. 1978, Gambino et al. 1990). Feral

colonies usually occupied cavities located in living
trees (Avitabile et al. 1978, Gambino et al. 1990, Ol-
droyd et al. 1994), although Seeley and Morse (1976)
reported 25% of colonies using cavities in dead trees.
Most occupied cavities had a single entrance, which
also was reported in other studies (Seeley and Morse
1976, Avitabile et al. 1978, Gambino et al. 1990). En-
trance height varied, but may be more a function of
available options than a preference for the reported
heights. Entrances recorded in this study were smaller
than those reported by others (Avitabile et al. 1978,
Gambino et al. 1990).
Usually, the observed cavity attributes were similar
to those reported from other areas. However, cavity
constraints on feral colonies vary depending on geo-
graphic location. For example, tropically adapted Af-
ricanized honey bees typically have smaller colony
sizes and store less honey than temperately adapted
European honey bees (Winston et al. 1981). There-
fore, Africanized colonies often use smaller cavities
than European colonies (Seeley and Morse 1976, See-
ley 1977). These differences highlight selection pres-
suresfacedbyferalhoneybeesindifferentgeographic

Preferences for different nest site characteristics
have been proposed for Africanized and European
honey bees. Schmidt and Hurley (1995) reported that
Africanized honey bees showed no preference for
cavity sizes ranging from 13.5 to 30 liters, whereas
European honey bees preferred larger cavity sizes.
However, no differences were found in the structural
and environmental attributes of cavities occupied by
Africanized or European colonies in this study. Cavity
volume could not be measured, so perhaps differences
do exist in volume between cavities used by African-
ized and European colonies in the study area. To date,
selection for volume and shape (Schmidt and Thoenes
1992) are the only nest site characteristics that have
been compared between European and Africanized
colonies.
With the exception of Taber (1979), no other pub-
lished studies have examined cavity occupancy
through time. The time occupied and turnover indices
provide different information about the quality of a
cavity. Cavities occupied a majority of the time, but
with high turnover rates, may not be as suitable for
feral colonies as cavities occupied for long periods of
time with little or no turnover. Therefore, together
these indices provide an estimate of overall cavity
quality. However, none of the measured cavity at-
tributes were correlated with the time occupied and
turnover indices, so cavities do not seem to vary in
their suitability for honey bees based on the measured
structural and environmental attributes. Other studies
have documented preferences for certain nest site
characteristics. For example, colonies selected nest
sites 5 m and 3 m off the ground over nest sites 1 m off
the ground (Seeley and Morse 1978, Schmidt and
Thoenes 1987). However, these preferences have sel-
dom been related directly to corresponding data on
colony survival, growth, and reproduction and are not
comparable to this study in terms of the time occupied
and turnover indices. It was not possible to measure
cavity volume, which is perhaps the most important
cavity attribute, or at least the best documented in
terms of honey bee preferences.
Spatial and Temporal Patterns. The distribution of
feral colonies was aggregated throughout the time
period of this study, so spatial patterns do exist in
cavity use by the feral colonies (Table 1). However,
few studies have reported aggregations of A. mellifera
(but see Oldroyd et al. 1995, 1997 for European col-
onies in Australia; McNally and Schneider 1996 for
African colonies in Botswana, Africa). The lack of
reported aggregations by A. mellifera suggests that
swarms tend to disperse, suitable nest sites are not
common, or few surveys have been conducted for
feral colonies (Oldroyd et al. 1995).
Swarm dispersal distances range from a few hun-
dred meters to 10,000 m (Schmidt and Thoenes 1990,
Schneider 1995, Camazine et al. 1999), and Otis et al.
(1981) estimated maximum ßight distances based on
engorgement and metabolic rates as 64 km for repro-
ductive swarms and 131 km for absconding colonies.
Some studies have reported swarms selecting nearby
nest sites (Jaycox and Parise 1980, 1981), but others
have reported swarms selecting more distant sites
(Seeley and Morse 1977). These ambiguous results
probably represent genetic differences between the
colonies studied and/or local patterns of resource
availability (Winston 1987). Colony aggregations also
may result from the attraction of swarms to existing
colonies not near the parent colony (Oldroyd et al.
1995). These different scenarios can be evaluated by
examining the relatedness of colonies in aggregations.
Related colonies would support the short dispersal
distance scenario and unrelated colonies would sup-
port the attraction scenario. Oldroyd et al. (1995)
found some completely unrelated colonies in aggre-
gations in Wyperfeld National Park, northwestern
Victoria, Australia, rejecting the explanation of short
dispersal distances. The familial relationships among

colonies have not been examined on the Welder Wild-
life Refuge. However, four different mitotypes have
been identiÞed (Pinto et al. 2004). The number of
colonies with different mitotypes through time does
not seem to support the short dispersal distance (re-
lated colonies) scenario, although low colony or
swarm survival could conceal this pattern.
Jaycox and Parise (1980, 1981) and Seeley and
Morse (1977) suggested that swarms select nearby
cavities when cavity availability is high. Therefore,
colony aggregations would be expected when cavities
are abundant. Oldroyd et al. (1994) estimated up to
11,000 hollows per km2 within the same study area
used by Oldroyd et al. (1995), suggesting an abun-
dance of cavities. They also reported that nectar and
pollen sources are abundant. However, the area sur-
veyed only formed a 100-m-wide swath of suitable
habitat (Oldroyd et al. 1995), so cavities may be un-
common at a broader spatial scale (larger extent). The
same conclusion could be drawn for the suitable hab-
itat on the Welder Wildlife Refuge. Although suitable
habitat is abundant within the refuge and several ad-
joining counties, live oak mottes, the main cavity
source for feral honey bee colonies, are not abundant
at a larger scale. Based on vegetation communities
deÞned by McMahan et al. (1984), cavities probably
are available in the Texas coastal bend (including the
counties of Gonzales, Lavaca, Dewitt, Victoria, Jack-
son, Goliad, Calhoun, McMullen, Live Oak, Bee, Refu-
gio, Aransas, San Patricio, Duval, Jim Wells, Nueces,
Kleberg, Brooks, and Kenedy) in the mesquiteÐlive
oakÐbluewood parks, live oak woods and parks, post
oak woods, forest and grassland mosaic, and post-oak
woods and forest. These habitats comprise 22% of the
area, whereas the highly suitable habitat of mesquiteÐ
live oakÐbluewood parks found on the Welder Wild-
life Refuge make up only 2% of the Texas coastal bend
region. Thus, the distribution of cavity sources is
patchy and potentially rare at a broader spatial scale
(large extent).
In addition to dispersal behavior and resource dis-
tributions, other proposed hypotheses to explain col-
ony aggregations include predator defenses and mat-
ing efÞciency (Seeley et al. 1982, Oldroyd et al. 1995).
There is controversy over whether aggregations
would serve to decrease or increase the probability of
predation (Seeley et al. 1982, Oldroyd et al. 1995).
However, aggregations may increase predator detec-
tion because colonies may become alerted when a
nearby colony is disturbed (Seeley et al. 1982). Pos-
sible predators on honey bee colonies that are present
on the Welder Wildlife Refuge include skunks, birds,
opossums, shrews, armadillos, and invertebrates, such
as wasps, ants, and moths (Winston 1987). However,
these animals probably have a minimal impact on the
feral colonies because most are located in tree cavities
several meters off the ground with relatively small
entrances. Therefore, the observed aggregated pat-
tern probably does not result from predator defenses.
Last, aggregations may increase mating efÞciency
by decreasing the distance to drone congregation ar-
eas. In the case of unrelated aggregations, the prob-
ability of mating with brothers also would be de-
creased (Oldroyd et al. 1995). Mating with brothers
results in diploid males and reduces brood viability
(Page1980).Therefore,mechanismsthatdecreasethe
probability of mating with brothers should be selected
for, such as multiple matings and unrelated aggrega-
tions.
When examining the spatial and temporal patterns
of Africanized and European colonies, we found that
cavities used by both colony types were aggregated
during1995and1996,andrandomlydistributedduring
1997 (Table 3). However, from 1998 through 2000,
Africanized colonies were aggregated and European
colonies were randomly distributed (Table 3). There-

fore, spatial patterns differ between Africanized and
European colonies, and these patterns vary through
time.
An analysis of spatial patterns of mtDNA follows the
maternal ancestry of colonies through the invasion
process, as Africanized honey bees arrived and be-
came established in an area with an existing feral
population of European honey bees. However,
mtDNA does not reßect paternal contributions to the
invasion process (Schneider et al. 2004), although the
pattern of mtDNA is closely followed by the nuclear
pattern within our study system (Pinto et al. 2005).
After the initial 2 yr (1993 and 1994) when sample
sizes of Africanized colonies were too small to eval-
uate spatially, Africanized honey bees were aggre-
gated, with the exception of 1997. The 1997 sampling
year seems to be a transition period, with the random
distribution of Africanized and European colonies.
After that time, European colonies remained ran-
domly distributed, while Africanized colonies were
aggregated. Therefore, the invasion of Africanized
honey bees seem to have fragmented the existing
European population, corresponding to a decrease in
the overall number of European colonies in the study
area.
