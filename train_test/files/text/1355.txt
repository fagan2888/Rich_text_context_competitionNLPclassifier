Background: Some lifestyle behaviors and obesity are risk factors
for vascular disease, but their relation to kidney disease is uncertain.
Methods: To determine whether physical inactivity, smoking, alco-
hol drinking and obesity are associated with the risk of chronic kidney
disease, we examined data from a nonconcurrent cohort study of 9,082
U.S. adults, aged 30­74 years, who participated in the second National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) from 1976
through 1980. By linking the NHANES II Mortality Study with the
Medicare end-stage kidney disease registry, we identified 189 incident
cases of either treated end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney
disease-related death through 1992.
Results: The risk of chronic kidney disease was related to physical
inactivity both with and without adjustment for age, sex, race and
body-mass index. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of moderately
active versus very active persons was 1.2 (95% confidence interval
 0.7­1.8), and of inactive versus very active was 2.2 (1.3­3.8).
Risk was also related to smoking; the RR in smokers of 1­20
cigarettes a day versus never smokers was 1.2 (0.7­2.3), and in
smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day, the RR was 2.3 (1.3­4.2).
The RR in morbidly obese (body-mass index  35 kg/m2) compared
with normal weight persons was 2.3 (1.1­4.9), but risk was not
increased for those classified as overweight or obese. Obesity risk
appeared largely mediated by diabetes and hypertension, whereas
physical inactivity risk was only partly explained by these factors,
and smoking risk was independent of them. Alcohol consumption
was not related to chronic kidney disease.
Conclusions: These data suggest that physical inactivity, smoking
and morbid obesity contribute to the risk of chronic kidney disease.

End-stage kidney disease has a considerable human and
social cost. Annual costs for medical care exceed $50,000
per person, and the 5-year survival is less than 50%.1 There
are few well-established risk factors for end-stage kidney
disease. Diabetes and hypertension are strong predictors for
the development and progression of chronic kidney diseases.2-4
Experimental studies5 have pointed to strong similarities be-
tween the process of systemic atherosclerosis and glomerulo-
sclerosis (a common histologic end-point for chronic kidney
diseases), suggesting analogous biologic mechanisms. We do
not know whether glomerulosclerosis is caused by the intrarenal
vascular disease associated with atherosclerosis, or whether it
results from shared risk factors. However, it seems likely that the
underlying risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as obesity,
physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol consumption, might
also predict the risk of chronic kidney disease.
Research on this question is sparse and inconclusive.
Physical activity has been associated with a lower rate of
nephropathy6 and renal dysfunction7 in diabetic patients, but
its relation to the risk of chronic kidney disease in the general
population is unknown. Smoking is a well-established risk
factor for renal damage in diabetic patients,8,9 but its role in
other types of kidney disease is still debated.10-14 Alcohol
drinking has been associated with an increased risk of end-stage
renal disease in the U.S. population.15 The association of obesity

tion16 and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis17,18 suggests that
obesity may be a primary cause of chronic renal failure.
We analyzed data from a cohort study that passively
followed a subset of participants in the second National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) to
test the hypotheses that physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol
drinking and obesity are associated with the risk of chronic
kidney disease in general, and with diabetic or hypertensive
nephropathy in particular.
METHODS
Study Cohort
We constructed a population-based, nonconcurrent co-
hort study by linking several data sources. One was
NHANES II, a cross-sectional survey conducted between
1976 and 1980, which collected extensive demographic, nu-
tritional and health data in a probability sample of the U.S.
civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 6 months to 74
years.19 Another was the Health Care Financing Administra-
tion's end-stage renal disease Program Management and
Medical Information System, also referred to as the Medicare
end-stage renal disease registry. Finally, we used mortality
data from the NHANES II Mortality Study, which ascertained
subsequent vital status of 9,250 participants who were age 30-75
years at the time of their NHANES II examination.20 We
excluded 5 of these 9,250 individuals because they had treated
end-stage kidney disease at baseline, according to the Medicare
registry. We restricted the analysis to individuals identified as
African-American or white, excluding 163 others because their
chronic kidney disease risk was extremely heterogeneous. These
exclusions left 9,082 subjects for analysis.
Exposure to Potential Risk Factors
The NHANES II survey included a structured inter-
view, a standardized physical examination and laboratory
tests. To assess physical activity, participants were asked
whether they were getting "much exercise," "moderate exer-
cise" or "little exercise" for recreation, and whether, in their
usual day, aside from recreation, they were "very active,"
"moderately active" or "quite inactive." We combined the
activity categories in the two questions as follows. Persons
getting "much exercise" or "very active" were classified as
"very active" and used as the reference group; those reporting
"little exercise" or being "quite inactive" were classified as
"inactive;" all the others were considered "moderately ac-
tive." For smoking, participants were asked whether they had
smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their entire life, whether
they currently smoked, and the daily number of cigarettes
smoked. We defined those who answered "yes" to the first
two questions as current smokers, and those who responded
"yes" to the first but "no" to the second as former smokers.
Those who had smoked less than 100 cigarettes were cate-
gorized as nonsmokers. We then classified current smokers
into two categories: those who smoked 20 or fewer cigarettes
per day, and those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per
day. A food-frequency questionnaire provided information
about the frequency of consumption of beer, wine and liquor.
Participants were asked about their usual consumption of
alcoholic beverages during the 3 months that preceded the
interview. Consumption was classified as follows: never,
seldom (less than once per week), weekly (one to six times
per week) or daily (one or more times per day). The greatest
frequency of reported alcohol consumption of any of the three
types was used to assign an overall category of individual
alcohol use. Body-mass index (BMI) was calculated from
height and weight (kg/m2), and categorized according to the
World Health Organization's classification21 as follows: thin
(BMI  18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5  BMI  25),
overweight (25  BMI  30), obese (30  BMI  35) and
morbidly obese (BMI  35).
We also recorded data about known renal risk factors
that may be confounders or mediators for the relations we
were studying. Seated blood pressure was measured twice
during the physical examination, and averaged. Participants
were considered hypertensive if they reported being told by a
doctor that they had hypertension, or if they had a systolic
blood pressure 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure
90 mmHg. We considered participants to have diagnosed
diabetes if they reported ever having been told by a doctor
that they had diabetes, and a history of cardiovascular disease
if they reported ever having had heart failure, a heart attack or
a stroke. We analyzed serum cholesterol according to the
protocol described for the Lipid Research Clinics program,22
and measured serum creatinine with the Jaffé reaction.
Outcomes
We studied chronic kidney diseases, which we defined
by either: (1) treatment of end-stage kidney disease due to
any cause; or (2) death related to chronic kidney disease.
Treated cases of end-stage kidney disease were identi-
fied by obtaining Medicare end-stage renal disease registry
data for NHANES II participants. The Medicare registry
began on 1 January 1973 and contains records for 93% of all
persons in the U.S. who have received renal replacement
therapy since that date. Matching was conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics without knowledge of
the participant's exposure status through 31 December 1992,
on the basis of the participant's name (surname, first name,
middle initial), date of birth, sex and race. The matching
algorithm required exact or nearly exact matches on name
and date of birth, except that in some instances, mismatches
on surname were allowed for women. A quality-of-match
variable was generated, and initial matches were classified
into three categories: definite (exact match in all four fields or
minor mismatch in one field, eg, different middle initial), prob-

480
able (similar but inexact match in two fields, eg, surname spelled
slightly differently and middle initial missing) and possible (eg,
nonmatch for surname in women only, or similar but inexact
match in three fields). Only individuals with a definite or a
probable match were considered treated cases.
We identified chronic kidney-disease-related deaths us-
ing the NHANES II Mortality Study conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics.20 Deaths were ascertained
through 31 December 1992 by computerized matching to the
Social Security Administration Death Master Files (1976­
1988) and the National Death Index (1979­1992). Initial
linkers were name, date of birth and sex. Matching was
further reviewed manually according to the above criteria as
well as race, state of birth, state of residence and marital
status. Death certificates were abstracted to obtain the date, as
well as the underlying and contributing causes of death.
Deaths were classified as related to chronic kidney disease if
any of the following codes of International Classification of
Disease 9th Revision23 was listed on the death certificate as
the underlying or contributing cause: 250.4 (diabetes mellitus
with nephropathy), 275.4 (nephrocalcinosis), 403 (hyperten-
sive renal disease), 404 (hypertensive heart and renal dis-
ease), 580­589 (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephro-
sis) and 593.9 (renal disease not otherwise specified).
Outcomes are mutually exclusive, so that patients who
first received renal replacement therapy and then died of renal
disease were classified as "treated end-stage kidney disease."
Statistical Analysis
Weighted prevalences of baseline characteristics and
exposures were estimated with Software for Survey Data
Analysis (SUDAAN) to account for the complex survey
sampling. Incidence rates in person-years were calculated
with weighted Poisson models in STATA 6.0. We used
Kaplan­Meier survival methods to estimate the overall cu-
mulative incidence in the cohort,24 and constructed three Cox
proportional hazards regression models to determine the rel-
ative risk of developing chronic kidney disease associated
with exposures.25 Model 1 included the four hypothesized
exposures, ie, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consump-
tion and BMI adjusted for age, sex and race; Model 2
included all the aforementioned variables, with further ad-
justment for serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and a
history of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease;
and Model 3 contained the variables from model 2, with
adjustment for glomerular filtration rate, calculated with the
prediction equation in Levey et al26 based on age, sex, race
and serum creatinine. In these models, age, systolic blood
pressure, serum cholesterol and estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate were analyzed continuously. With one exception, of
all the variables used in this analysis, less than 0.5% were
missing. The exception was serum creatinine, and conse-
quently, calculated glomerular filtration rate, which was lack-
ing for 30% of the participants.
To assess the robustness of the main results, we con-
ducted several subsidiary analyses. First, to avoid possible
intermingling of acute and chronic causes of renal failure, we
conducted an analysis after excluding 23 incident cases with a
diagnosis of acute renal failure on their death certificate; in the
same way, because of possible misclassification of chronic
kidney disease on death certificates, we conducted an analysis
limited to incident cases that were treated for end-stage kidney
disease, using Model 1 because of the small number of events.
Second, to enhance the sensitivity of baseline assessment for
diabetes, we limited our analyses to a subset of 3,182 subjects
who underwent oral glucose-tolerance tests.
Third, to minimize the possibility of reverse causation
(ie, the possibility that incipient chronic kidney disease at
baseline would have modified exposure to the studied risk
factors), we repeated the analyses after excluding subjects
with a high serum creatinine at baseline, as defined by a value
above 1.4 mg/dL (124 mol/L) in men, and above 1.2 mg/dL
(106 mol/L) in women, and excluding incident cases that
occurred within 5 years of follow-up. Finally, to enhance the
clinical specificity of the outcomes, we divided chronic kid-
ney disease into two broad categories: kidney disease due to
diabetes or hypertension, and kidney disease due to other or
unspecified causes.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the
9,082 NHANES II participants included in our study. Values
represent U.S. prevalence estimates of lifestyle behaviors and
health conditions from 1976 to 1980.
Incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease
Over the 12-16 years (13.2 years on average) covered
by the study, 189 subjects developed chronic kidney disease
(Table 2). Of these, 44 (23%) entered the Medicare end-stage
renal disease program, 23 (12%) had kidney disease listed as
an underlying cause of death, and 122 (65%) had it listed as
a contributing cause. The overall cumulative incidence by age
75 was 8.9%. Diabetic and hypertensive nephropathies rep-
resented 50% of the assigned cases of treated end-stage
kidney disease, and 26% and 12% of the assigned underlying
and contributing causes of death, respectively.
Lifestyle Factors and Obesity as Risk Factors
After adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, alcohol and
smoking, the risk of chronic kidney disease was related to
physical inactivity (Table 3). Compared with very active
persons, those who were inactive had more than twice the risk
of chronic kidney disease (Model 1). Further adjustment for

self-reported diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure,
serum cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and baseline calcu-
lated glomerular filtration rate partly altered this association
(Models 2 and 3). A graded relation was observed with
smoking status (Model 1), even after controlling for the other
variables (Models 2 and 3). Alcohol consumption was not
related to the risk of chronic kidney disease, with the analysis
by type of alcohol beverages showing similar patterns for
beer, wine and liquor (data not shown).
The relation between BMI and the risk of chronic
kidney disease was not graded, but those with morbid obesity
had a risk of chronic kidney disease more than twice that of
normal-weight persons, independent of age, sex, race, phys-
ical activity and smoking (Model 1). Adjustment for diabetes,
hypertension and blood pressure notably weakened this as-
sociation (Model 2).
When Model 2 was restricted to a subsample of the
6,341 subjects with a measurement of serum creatinine, the
results were similar to those for the entire sample. This
finding suggests that differences observed between Models 2
and 3 cannot be ascribed to differential subject selection.
Adjustment for socioeconomic status, as defined by income
and level of education, did not modify the above associations.
Subsidiary Analyses
Excluding the 23 incident cases with acute renal failure
did not alter the relations with physical inactivity (adjusted
relative risk [RR] of inactive persons compared with very
active persons in Model 1: 2.4 [95% confidence interval,
1.3­4.6]), smoking (RR of smokers of 1­20 cigarettes a day
vs never smokers: 1.3 [0.7­2.5], and for those of 20
cigarettes a day: 2.3 [1.2­4.6]), alcohol consumption and
BMI (RR of morbidly obese compared with normal weight
persons: 2.2 [1.0­5.1]).This was also true when restricting
the outcome to the 44 incident cases with treated end-stage
kidney disease, except for the relation with smoking, which
was more modest (Model 1: RR of smokers of 1­20 cigarettes
a day compared with never smokers, 1.2 [0.3­4.3], and for
those of more than 20 cigarettes a day, 1.2 [0.3­4.9]).
Adjustment for biochemically defined diabetes did not mod-
ify the main study results. In particular, among the 3,182
participants who underwent the oral glucose-tolerance test,
the RR for inactive persons compared with the RR for those
who were very active was very similar, after adjusting for
either self-reported diabetes (RR  1.7 [0.7­4.5]) or bio-
chemically defined diabetes (RR  1.8 [0.7­4.9]). Exclusion
neither of subjects with high serum creatinine at baseline, nor
of incident cases that occurred within the first 5 years of
follow-up modified any of the observed associations.
To test the hypothesis that the risk factors we studied
were more strongly related to diabetic and hypertensive
nephropathies than to the other types of kidney disease, we
split the cases in two groups. Physical inactivity was more
strongly associated with the risk of diabetic or hypertensive
nephropathy than with that of other types of kidney disease
(Table 4). BMI and alcohol consumption were similarly
related to both types. The relation to smoking was weaker in
those with diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy than in those
with other types of kidney disease.

DISCUSSION
Our study suggests that physical inactivity, cigarette
smoking and morbid obesity contribute to the development of
chronic kidney disease in the general population. In contrast,
we did not find that alcohol consumption was related to a
higher risk of chronic kidney disease.
The most important obstacles to studying renal risk
factors prospectively are the relatively low incidence and the

long latency period of chronic kidney diseases.27 Nonconcur-
rent cohort studies based on passive follow-up of individuals
with previous extensive data collection, such as the NHANES
II Mortality Study and its complementary renal morbidity
study, provide a unique opportunity to examine the renal risk
associated with numerous factors, and are also highly cost-
effective. The large size of the initial cohort and the 12-to-
16-year follow-up period produced a large number of cases.
Previous prospective studies of renal risk factors con-
sidered end-stage renal disease as defined by entry into the
Medicare registry or death from renal disease as the under-
lying cause.2,3 Here, we also studied the contributing causes
of death to identify chronic kidney diseases in persons who
may have died of another cause before reaching the end-stage
and requiring renal replacement therapy. The use of multiple-
cause mortality data has been shown to be particularly useful
in studying long-term diseases that are not necessarily fatal,
but are sufficiently serious to be listed on the death certificate.
Renal disease is an excellent example of this situation, be-
cause it appears on U.S. death certificates 5 times more often
as a contributing cause of death than as an underlying
cause.28 Consideration of both underlying and contributing
causes of death strongly improves the sensitivity of case
ascertainment and, therefore, the study power.
Few studies have related physical activity to the risk of
chronic kidney disease. In one study, an association was
observed between increased levels of leisure physical activity
and a reduced occurrence of nephropathy in individuals with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.6 Because of the cross-
sectional design of that study, however, it was unclear
whether that association reflected a protective effect of phys-
ical activity or simply physical limitations due to the disease
itself. More interestingly, a prospective study of adults with
diabetes found leisure physical activity to be negatively

related to early renal function decline.7 Animal studies are
even scarcer. One study found that repeated exercise training
increased glomerular filtration rate in mice with reduced renal
mass.29 We can postulate that physical activity has a protec-
tive effect against chronic kidney disease from the similar
mechanisms that have been described for cardiovascular
disease. Physical activity protects against cardiovascular dis-
ease by reducing risks of obesity, high blood pressure, ad-
verse blood lipid profiles and noninsulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, but it may also afford protection independent of
those factors.30-31 In our study, the relation between physical
activity and chronic kidney disease appeared partly mediated
by diabetes and hypertension.
Cardiovascular diseases and chronic renal failure may,
however, themselves cause low physical activity. The relation
observed might thus reflect reduced activity due to the pres-
ence of these conditions at baseline, rather than causality.
Controlling for a history of cardiovascular disease and esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate, or excluding individuals with
a high serum creatinine at baseline from the analysis, did not
alter our finding, which suggests that reverse causation is
unlikely. Our results were not substantially changed when we
excluded incident cases that occurred within the first 5 years
of follow-up (ie, subjects with any condition that might have
led to reduced physical activity and early death). This also
indicates that reverse causation is unlikely. Although we
controlled for baseline diabetes and hypertension, the fol-
low-up period of 12­16 years is sufficient for these diseases
to occur and even progress to chronic kidney disease. The
fact that low physical activity was more strongly associated
with diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy than with other
renal diseases is compatible with a possible role of these
diseases in the causal pathway.
The renal risk from smoking is better documented than
that of other lifestyle risk factors.8-14,32-38 Our findings are
consistent with those of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial study, in which a similar graded relation was observed
in a large cohort of men.12 They are also consistent with
results from studies conducted in selected populations of
older nondiabetic subjects,36 and of patients with diabetic
nephropathy,9 primary glomerulonephritis13,14 or polycystic
kidney disease,13 in which smoking was clearly related to the
decline in renal function. Nevertheless, one large population-
based case-control study failed to find that smoking was
related to end-stage renal disease (from any cause).10
When we restricted the analysis to treated end-stage
kidney diseases, we no longer observed an association with
smoking. Although it is possible that this finding is due to the
limited power of this restricted analysis, we cannot rule out
the possibility that the apparent relation of smoking with
chronic kidney disease resulted from its relation with the
other causes of death. An alternative explanation, however, is
that smokers with chronic kidney disease are more likely to
die before reaching end-stage renal failure and requiring
replacement therapy than are their nonsmoking counterparts,
ie, that smoking would be a risk factor for the severity of the
disease through co-morbidities; this explanation would pro-
duce the same apparent discrepancies among epidemiological
studies.
Several studies with different approaches suggest that
smoking plays a causal role in renal damage. It has been
related to increased microalbuminuria, proteinuria and serum
creatinine, and to decreased glomerular filtration rates in
patients with diabetes or hypertension,37 as well as in healthy
individuals.32,33,36 It has been associated with transient but
repeated increases of blood pressure, with renal hemody-
namic dysfunction,34-35 and with damage to small vessels.38
Although the biologic mechanisms involved in smoking-
induced renal damage are unknown, the latter may result
from several nonexclusive mechanisms, including direct and
indirect effects of smoking (and nicotine) on the kidney, as
reviewed by Orth et al.8
Epidemiological studies of the relation between alcohol
consumption and chronic kidney disease are scarce.15,29 In
Perneger's large population-based case-control study,15 con-
sumption of more than two alcoholic drinks per day was
associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of end-stage renal
disease, whereas lower intake of alcohol did not appear to be
harmful. In our study, alcohol consumption did not appear as
a risk factor for chronic kidney disease. However, the small
number of daily drinkers did not permit further stratification
by number of drinks per day, specifying a subgroup of heavy
drinkers.
Adiposity promotes an adverse profile of cardiovascu-
lar risk factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
reduced high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated fi-
brinogen. Most of these factors have also been shown to be
strongly related to an increased risk of chronic and end-stage
renal failure.2,3,40 In this study, BMI was associated with an
increased risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the rela-
tion appeared to be limited to morbid obesity, and was largely
mediated by hypertension and diabetes (since adjustment for
these conditions strongly weakened the relative risk). Several
mechanisms have been proposed to relate obesity to hyper-
tension and glomerulosclerosis, and thus to chronic renal
failure.16 These include altered histology and compression of
the renal medulla, leading to activation of the renin-angio-
tensin system, renal vasodilation and increased glomerular
filtration rate and hypertension, as well as metabolic abnor-
malities (eg, lipids, glucose intolerance), ultimately resulting
in hypertension and glomerulosclerosis. Thus, there is a
biologic basis for the possible role of extreme obesity in the
development of chronic kidney disease. This observation is
also consistent with the overlapping time trends of obesity42
and end-stage renal disease incidence1 in the U.S., and the

emergence of obesity-related glomerulopathy observed by
pathologists.17,18
Several limitations deserve comments. First, in our
main analyses, we used the same International Classification
of Disease codes to define chronic kidney diseases as in other
similar cohorts,2,3,12 which permits comparison of results, but
has the disadvantage of including a few cases of acute renal
disease. Subsidiary analysis excluding these cases, however,
did not alter our findings. Second, inaccuracy of renal diag-
nosis on death certificates43may have also resulted in some
degree of misclassification; approximately one third of the
cases with underlying causes of death, and half of the con-
tributing causes were assigned to renal failure not specified as
acute or chronic. Although it is likely that the great majority
of these cases of renal failure were chronic, we cannot rule
out the possibility that some of them may have been acute.
Nevertheless, restricting the outcome to treated end-stage
kidney diseases (none due to acute renal failure) showed very
similar relations to physical inactivity, obesity and alcohol
consumption, strongly suggesting that the two groups of
cases (treated and dead) were comparable as far as their
association with these exposures were concerned. Third, the
study had limited power in subgroup analysis. In particular,
we were not able to study potential interactions with sex or
race. Finally, most studies encounter difficulty in assessing
baseline kidney disease to differentiate risk factors for initi-
ation from those for progression of the disease. We addressed
this limitation in two ways. First, prevalent end-stage kidney
disease cases were excluded from the main analysis. Second,
a subsidiary analysis was conducted that excluded subjects
with hypercreatininemia at baseline, which might be consid-
ered overly conservative and could lead to a lack of power.
Nevertheless, it remains difficult to determine whether a
given risk factor plays a role in the initiation or in the
progression of kidney disease.
Our results have two main implications. First, the
increase in the incidence of kidney disease in the U.S.
population44 may be partly explained by the corresponding
rise in obesity and physical inactivity.42 Second, programs to
promote physical activity, smoking cessation and weight
reduction may reduce the growing burden of kidney disease
in the U.S., as well as contribute to cardiovascular disease
reduction.
