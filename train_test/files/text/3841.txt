What Is Honesty? Laypersons Interpret
High Lie Scale Scores as Reflecting Intentional
Dishonesty: Rejoinder to de Vries et al.'s
(2017) Comment on Feldman et al. (2017)

Abstract
Scholars have recently been questioning the original premise of lie scales as measuring dishonesty for social desirability, with some
even claiming that lie scales may in fact represent higher honesty (e.g., de Vries et al., 2017 commentary on Feldman, Lian,
Kosinski, & Stillwell, 2017). In a preregistered experiment, I examined the relationship between lie scales and honesty by directly
assessing laypersons' perceptions of honesty reflected in lie scales. Overall, laypersons perceived higher lie scale scores as
reflecting higher dishonesty and higher lie scale scorers as more intentionally dishonest and socially sensitive, endorsing a negative
(and rejecting a positive) relationship between lie scales and honesty. These findings provide empirical support for lie scales as
capturing dishonesty. I discuss implications and possible directions for addressing the complexity inherent in the construct of
honesty and the need for an integration of the seemingly contradictory findings to advance the debate regarding lie scales and
honesty.

Introduction
There is an ongoing debate regarding what lie scales measure.
Lie scales, sometimes referred to as impression management,
other deception, or the gamma factor scales, are associated with
mixed and confusing findings that make it difficult to interpret
how well they capture honesty or what aspects of personality
they reflect (Uziel, 2010). Traditionally, lie scales were con-
structed to measure deceit for appearing more socially desir-
able. Later accounts interpreted high scores on lie scales as
capturing aspects of response styles and personality traits. The
"defensiveness approach" argued lie scales are capturing
defensiveness of the self, reflecting distortions in self-
evaluations and avoidance of social disapproval (Crowne,
1979). The "adjustment approach" considered high lie scale
scores as reflecting healthy social functioning, and such
response styles as representing individuals who emphasize
social adjustment and coexistence with others in society. This
evolving debate exemplifies the different interpretations regard-
ing lie scales and lying. Do lie scales indeed capture lying, as
their title suggests, or perhaps lie scales have been completely
misunderstood and misinterpreted and are actually measuring
something else altogether, possibly even measuring honesty?
This debate has recently reemerged with a commentary cri-
ticizing the use and interpretation of a lie scale as a measure of
honesty in a study of the relationship between profanity and
honesty (Feldman et al., 2017). In the first out of three studies,
my colleagues and I found that two behavioral and one self-
reported measures of profanity had a negative relationship with
lie scale score using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire
Revised (Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985), and based on the
original premise of these scale and a large body of supporting
evidence (e.g., Davis, Thake, & Weekes, 2012) our interpreta-
tion of this evidence was that those who were higher on pro-
fanity use were more honest. De Vries et al. (2017) had
strong objections to this interpretation and summarized recent
evidence that suggests lie scales capture honesty, rather than
dishonesty. They therefore interpreted our evidence to mean
that "honest people tend to use less--not more--profanity"
(commentary title). They concluded by calling for a

and dishonesty" (p. 5).
In Table 1, I briefly address the main points in the commen-
tary. In the target article, we called for further debate and
empirical evidence and cautioned against drawing strong con-
clusions, and I am happy to see further evidence on the topic.
Yet, the commentary's accompanying criticism is often mis-
placed or unwarranted, the evidence suggestive, and the strong
conclusions premature. In this reply, I focus on the main criti-
cism--that high lie scale scores cannot be interpreted as
reflecting dishonesty. I argue that the debate on lie scales is far
from conclusion, and much more needs to be clarified and
examined regarding lie scales and honesty. I first review weak-
nesses in the arguments against interpreting lie scales as dis-
honesty, and I then provide strong experimental evidence
showing that laypersons understand and interpret high lie scale
Table 1. Brief Responses to the de Vries et al. Commentary Critics.
Commentary Arguments Response
"People who use profanities, both online and off-line,
may feel exonerated by the study."
The comment's use of "exonerated" and the opening note seems to reflect a
stance against profanity as being a negative behavior. We were cautious to
refrain from any positive or negative judgment of profanity or its users.
"Political representatives may even be stimulated to
increase their use of profanities hoping that it may
increase the public's perception of their integrity."
The target article did not address or discuss impressions of honesty. We
specifically cautioned against such interpretations in the general discussion.
"Feldman et al. (2017) [ . . . ] gathered three self-report
measures of people's profanity use"
Correction. We used one self-reported measure of profanity and two behavioral
measures of profanity.
Recent evidence has indicated that an interpretation of
impression management scales as reflecting less
honesty is fundamentally flawed
The recent evidence has not questioned previous evidence as being flawed but
presented new evidence about links between impression management scales
and other factors that is suggestive of a different interpretation.
"If impression management (or lie) scales actually did
measure lying on items such as `Do you always
practice what you preach?' the correlation between
self-ratings and ratings obtained from knowledgeable
others would have to be negative."
Two issues with this assumption:
(1) the very purpose of impression management is to affect impressions in
others,
(2) people are very bad at detecting lies, and there is ample evidence that close
others are even more biased and easily deceived (e.g., McCornack & Parks,
1986; Levine & McCornack, 1992).
Therefore, self-other agreements are not a good measure of objective truth.
"Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR)
impression management scale (Paulhus, 2002),
strongly correlated (e.g., r ¼ .61; Davies, French, &
Keogh, 1998) with, and similar in content to, the Lie
Scale used in Feldman et al.'s (2017) Study 1"
I welcome reporting of related evidence, yet note that the target article did not use
the BIDR nor the Davies et al. (1998) scale. The items and the response scale in
the BIDR are very different. Davies et al. changed the scale range used by the lie
scale from yes-no to a Likert-type scale. See the general discussion.
Lie scale used by the target article has been found to be
positively associated with trait honesty, as measured
by HEXACO-PI-R honesty-humility
I welcome reporting of related evidence, yet note that lie scales and trait honesty-
humility may not capture the same type of honesty. See the general discussion.
Scores on impression management scales have been
found to be negatively correlated with scores on
objective behavioral indicators of dishonesty
The target article specifically cautioned again interpreting lie scales as unethicality
or about generalizing findings to mean anything about unethicality. Lie scales and
unethicality measures do not capture the same type of honesty. See the general
discussion.
I welcome reporting of related evidence, yet caution that the evidence provided
is suggestive, as the profanity measure is confounded with the impression
management scale (BIDR) and was not meant to measure profanity.
The commentary authors complained about the target's Study 2 construct
validity but make very strong claims using a redefinition of a single item from an
unrelated scale typically used for a different purpose using data archive not
originally collected for the purpose of the intended profanity-honesty
investigation.
Lastly, a correlation of À.09 using a problematic self-reported profanity proxy
measure against an unethicality proxy for group aggregates based on
probabilities estimations (25%) should--at best--be interpreted with caution
and followed by further research before drawing strong conclusions.
"In summary, the above findings strongly suggest that the
conclusions of Feldman et al. (2017) are incorrect"
The strong statement is unwarranted given the evidence provided. The
commentary reflects one of several perspectives and a specific body of evidence
led by the commentary authors, which is not fully representative of the ongoing
debate on lie scales and the complexities of honesty. See general discussion for
possible directions for an integration of the mixed findings.

scores as being intentionally dishonest and reflecting social
sensitivity. Finally, I discuss implications for the lie scale and
honesty literatures and suggest directions for integration.
Lie Scales and Honesty
Lie scales measure unlikely answers to extreme statements
such as in answering "yes" to "are all your habits good and
desirable ones?" or answering "no" to questions such as "have
you ever said anything bad or nasty about anyone?" (Eysenck
& Eysenck, 1975; Eysenck et al., 1985). The premise was that
those who answer yes­no to the questions above--for whatever
reason--are most likely being deceitful, possibly in service of
some purpose or reflecting certain traits.
There is an ongoing debate regarding the meaning of lie
scales, and the question of what lie scales or impression man-
agement measures capture is still in debate (Uziel, 2010).
Scholars in the "adjustment view" (e.g., de Vries, Zettler, &
Hilbig, 2014; Dunlop, Morrison, Koenig, & Silcox, 2012;
Zettler, Hilbig, Moshagen, & de Vries, 2015) have come to
question the original premise of lie scales as measuring dis-
honesty and the "defensiveness view" (e.g., Davis et al.,
2012) based on two types of correlational evidence. First,
they demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between
lie scales and various measures of honesty, such as the
HEXACO (Lee & Ashton, 2004) honesty-humility personal-
ity trait and measures of unethical behavior. Second, they
demonstrated high correlations between self-ratings and
close others' ratings of lie scales items. Both are important
contributions, yet they are not necessarily evidence against
lie scales as representing dishonesty, and I explain further
below.
What Is Honesty? Discussion of Honesty Categories
Lie scales are at the intersection of two conflicting interpreta-
tions of honesty--honesty that is meant to express true self, and
honesty that is meant to reflect coexistence with others in soci-
ety (Erickson, 1995; see related discussion in Feldman et al.,
2017). Lie scales were designed to measure the sense of being
honest about and true to oneself, reflecting authenticity-
honesty. However, honesty trait measures, such as the
honesty-humility dimension of the HEXACO personality scale
(Lee & Ashton, 2004), measure sincerity, fairness, greed-
avoidance, and modesty, all socially desirable and focusing
on social aspects of honesty in capturing attitudes toward
manipulation of others and toward blunt unethical behavior
violating social norms and laws. These types of honesty are
very different from authenticity-honesty. A suggested typology
of the different types of honesty and examples from related
scales are provided in Table 2.
To give an example for a possible misalignment, authentic-
honest persons could act unethically if their true selves are
self-centered and deviate from the set norms. In such a case,

a person may cheat but would answer more truthfully about
his cheating behavior. Similarly, persons can adhere to
social-moral codes, yet in doing so may present themselves
dishonestly or conform by doing things that they do not wish
to do and would not admit to not wanting. In such a case, a
socially honest person may be insincere about own wants,
needs, desires, and emotions. It is therefore possible to differ-
entiate between at least two types of honesty, a distinction that
is not clearly mentioned or addressed in the lie scales debate.
Therefore, studies examining authenticity-honesty and stud-
ies examining social-honesty are not necessarily studying the
same kind of honesty. Findings of lie scale showing a negative
relationship with unethical behavior or positive relationship
with honesty-humility traits do not necessarily mean that lie
scales do not measure lying or that they may even measure
honesty. It is possible that lie scales simply capture a different
type of honesty.
Demonstrating self-other agreement on lie scales is also
problematic as evidence against lie scales, since the very pur-
pose of impression management is to affect impressions in
others, and there is ample evidence that others are biased and
easily deceived (e.g., McCornack & Parks, 1986; Levine &
McCornack, 1992). I return to this point in the discussion.
The Present Investigation
It is therefore important to directly examine whether lie scales
indeed capture dishonesty and specifically test authentic-
dishonesty as the type of honesty they were meant to assess.
I take a different approach than that taken so far regarding lie
scales. Rather than making assumptions about what laypersons
mean when they refer to honesty and do when answering lie
scales, or indirectly interpreting lie scales based on correlates
or using self-other comparisons, my approach uses experimen-
tal folk psychology methodology (Knobe et al., 2012; Knobe &
Nichols, 2013; Nichols, 2011; see example regarding honesty
in Turri & Turri, 2015) to more directly assess laypersons' cog-
nition regarding honesty and lie scales.
In a preregistered experiment, I examined laypersons' inter-
pretations of high and low scores and scorers in terms of hon-
esty to test (1) whether high- versus low-score answers are
perceived as more or less honest answers and (2) whether per-
sons with high versus low scores are perceived as more or less
honest people.
Experiment
Preregistration and Open Science
I preregistered the experiment on the Open Science Frame-
work and data collection was launched later that day. Prere-
gistration, power analyses, and all materials are available in
the Online Supplementary Materials and shared along with
data and code on the Open Science Framework (https://
osf.io/7gnfe/).
Participants
A total of 302 American Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
participants (Mage
¼ 36.79, SDage
¼ 12.21; 150 female) were
recruited online using TurkPrime.com (Litman, Robinson, &
Abberbock, 2017). MTurk participants have considerable
experience in taking part in surveys and experiments, and I
therefore expected that some may have taken the lie scale
before. To prevent any possible biases, I preregistered the
exclusion of participants who indicated that they were famil-
iar with or have taken the scale before. I excluded 40 partici-
pants in total (13.2%), leaving a sample of 262 (Mage
¼ 36.88,
SDage
¼ 12.22; 129 female), although exclusions had no effect
on the results (full results reported in the Online Supplemen-
tary Material).
Procedure and Measures
The experiment included three parts. The first part was a
within-subject experiment with each participant rating two lie
scale answer profiles--a high score on the lie scale and a low
score on the lie scale (see Table 3). The presentation order of
the two profiles was randomized. Participants were asked to

rate for each of the answer profiles whether a participant who
answered in such a way (1) answered truthfully, (2) is generally
an honest person, (3) cares what others think of him or her,
(4) understood the questions, (5) read the questions carefully,
(6) believes that his or her answers reflect the truth (intention-
ality), (7) answered as most people would, and (8) answered
randomly (1 ¼ Extremely unlikely; 7 ¼ Extremely likely).
In the second part, both answer profiles were presented side
by side as representing two persons. Participants were asked to
compare the two and were forced to choose which of the two
persons (1) is a more honest person, (2) has answered the ques-
tions more honestly, (3) cares more what others think of him or
her, and (4) better represents the average person's answers.
In the third part, I ran a between-subject design experi-
ment and participants were randomly assigned to one of two
conditions for the two conflicting interpretations of the lie
scale as representing either low or high honesty. Participants
were asked to rate their agreement with the interpretation
presented in their assigned condition (1 ¼ Strongly disagree;
7 ¼ Strongly agree).
Results
Means, standard deviations, and summary statistics for Part 1
are provided in Table 4. Participants perceived persons with
low lie scale score as answering more truthfully (d ¼ 1.55),
as believing their answers are truthful (d ¼ 1.13), as being more
honest (d ¼ 0.59), and as caring less about what others think of
them (d ¼ 2.10). Both answer profiles were perceived as
reflecting a good understanding of the items and as intentional
nonrandom responding (understanding: M ¼ 6.11/6.24; careful
reading: M ¼ 5.71/6.12; and random answering: M ¼ 1.95/
2.03; d ¼ 0.05 to 0.32; on 1­7 scale; one-sample t test compar-
ing to 4 as neutral answer: all |t| > 19.77, p < .001).
To examine the comparison between the two profiles in Part
2, I ran a binomial test contrasting proportions to a 50%­50%
random split choice. Participants rated the low lie scale score
as reflecting a more honest person (187/262, 71% CI [65%,
76%], binomial z ¼ 6.86, p < .001), as answering items more
truthfully (204/262, 78% confidence interval (CI) [72%, 82%],
binomial z ¼ 8.96, p < .001), and as caring less about what others
think of them (42/262, 16% CI [12%, 50%], binomial
z ¼ À10.94, p < .001). Ratings of the two profiles as representing
the average person did not significantly differ from a 50­50
split (137 vs. 125, 52% vs. 48%, binomial z ¼ .68, p ¼ .497).
Finally, participants showed higher agreement with the
interpretation that high lie scale scores represent lower honesty
(n ¼ 131, M ¼ 5.60, SD ¼ 1.57 vs. n ¼ 129, M ¼ 3.27,
SD ¼ 2.14, t(234.12) ¼ 10.03, p < .001, d ¼ 1.24 CI [0.97,
1.50]; one-sample t test comparing means to 4 as neutral
answer: both |t| > 3.87, p < .001).
Discussion
Laypersons perceived high lie scale scores as less honest than
low lie scale scores and high lie scale scorers as less honest
people than low lie scale scorers. Compared to low lie scale
scores, high lie scale scorers were interpreted as intentionally
deceitful and as reflecting caring more about what others think
of them. These results were consistent across rating high and
low lie scale scores independently and contrasts in a compari-
son of the two answer profiles. Finally, laypersons endorsed the
interpretation that high lie scale scores reflect lower honesty
and rejected the interpretation that high lie scale scores reflect
higher honesty.
These findings support the original premise of lie scales as
capturing dishonesty for socially desirability. These calls to
question the very strong statements made about lie scales as
clearly not reflecting dishonesty, mainly based on correlates
with other factors and self-other agreement (de Vries et al.,
2014; Uziel, 2014). At the very least, our findings exemplify
the need for a more complex and nuanced understanding of lie
scales than the clear-cut conclusions by de Vries et al. (2017),
arguing that lie scales most definitely do not reflect dishonesty.
Furthermore, laypersons viewed high lie scale scores as reflect-
ing a clear understanding of the items, a clear strategic agenda
in answering, and intentional dishonesty, contrary to the
untested argument that laypersons process the "spirit or gist
of the item [ . . . ] rather than exact wording" (De Vries et al.,
2017, Note 7).

Which raises the question--why would there be a negative
relationship between lie scales and measures of honesty-
humility traits and ethical behavior? There are two possible
explanations, and both could be relevant. The first, as sug-
gested in the introduction, is that lie scales capture a different
type of honesty than that measured by honesty-humility traits
and unethicality measures. I will not reiterate this point, but I
call scholars to differentiate between the types of honesty and
to clearly identify which type of honesty they aim to capture
and by what measure, noting the generalizability of their find-
ings, as we have in the target article. If we are to accept the pos-
sibility of different types of honesty, then it is likely that those
with high lie scale scores are high on authenticity-honesty and
possibly low on the social-honesty.
The second explanation is that the methodological approach
in assessing honesty reflected by lie scales using traits and
self-other agreements has limitations in evaluating
authenticity-honesty that lie scales were originally meant to
assess. Measuring honesty about oneself presents scholars with
a unique challenge. Take, for example, the paradoxical dilemma
embedded in lying self-reports (e.g., Halevy, Shalvi, &
Verschuere, 2014; Peer, Acquisti, & Shalvi, 2014)--Are people
who self-report themselves as liars honest about lying? Are peo-
ple who self-report to being honest lying to appear honest? How,
then, do we assess whether such self-reports about lying are hon-
est? One approach taken by personality scholars was to examine
correlates between such self-reports and various individual dif-
ferences and behaviors. This approach would be useful to the
extent that the correlated factors indeed capture the same
construct, yet honesty-humility may not capture the same con-
struct. A second approach was to assess self-other agreements.
Yet again, such an approach also embeds a paradox. If the very
purpose of impression management is to create more positive
impressions in others, then how would asking about others'
impressions behelpful?The assumption ofthatapproach was that
close others are likely to know a person well and their opinions
would therefore reflect an objective truth, yet ample research has
shown that people are generally bad at detecting and correcting
for deception or for impression management and that close others
are evenmoreeasilydeceivedandare generallymorebiased(e.g.,
McCornack & Parks, 1986; Levine & McCornack, 1992). Close
others are frequently lied to, even if lying is merely meant to pro-
tect them and their feelings, and are often surprised when learning
thatcheatingor deceit has taken place (Drouin,Tobin,& Wygant,
2014; Ennis, Vrij, & Chance, 2008), most vividly exemplified
by reactions to admissions of partners faking sexual interest,
pleasure, or experience in close romantic relationships (e.g.,
Muehlenhard & Shippee, 2010).
An integration of the findings regarding lie scales is possible
(1) with a typology of types of honesty with a clear and careful
use of the term and (2) by recognizing and addressing the lim-
itations of the correlates and self-other agreement approaches
in understanding honesty-authenticity and lie scales. To suc-
cessfully achieve such integration, further studies are needed,
employing different methods and including measures for the
different types of honesty.
An integration would also require an explanation of findings
for a negative relationship between lie scales and honesty-
humility or unethicality. Why would moral people lie about
who they are? First, moral people may self-justify lies for
social-moral reasons and may therefore even come to perceive
such lying as acceptable or needed. Violations of morals and
honesty are deemed acceptable if they can be easily justified
(Shalvi, Gino, Barkan, & Ayal, 2015), especially if allegedly
serving others (Gino, Ayal, & Ariely, 2013), and can help
reduce ethical dissonance between the moral-self and dishonest
behavior (Barkan, Ayal, & Ariely, 2015). Conformity to social
moral norms may serve as a powerful reason for justifying
white lies to the extent that such a lie could even be seen as
moral. Second, moral people are more sensitive to others'
views, behaviors, and criticism and tend to put others' concerns
above their own. As such, they are more likely to engage in
impression management to influence others' perceptions of
them as being more moral, social, and positive.
Conclusion
Those high on lie scales are perceived to be less honest about
who they are and their true selves, challenging the criticism that
lie scales cannot be reflective of dishonesty and that laypersons
do not perceive answers reflecting high lie scale scores as
lying. The debate on lie scales and honesty demonstrates the
complexity of defining and examining honesty. This raises the
need for (1) a typology of honesty categories (e.g., differentiat-
ing between authenticity-honesty and social-honesty), (2) a
clear identification of the type of honesty assessed or refer-
enced in empirical studies, and (3) further research to better
understand honesty and the relationships between honesty cate-
gories. The novel folk psychology empirical approach used in
this investigation can be used to further examine laypersons'
honesty perceptions and behavior.
