MOBILITY functioning is one of the most important
factors that affects independence and quality of life in
later years. Among older adults, difficulty with mobility is
associated with less time spent outside the home and worse
perceptions about general health status (Iezzoni, 2003;
Singh-Manoux et al., 2006). Older adults with mobility
limitations are also at higher risk of falling, developing dis-
ability, and dying earlier (Abellan van Kan et al., 2009; de
Rekeneire et al., 2003; Newman et al., 2006; Simonsick
et al., 2008). Given the potential impact that mobility limi-
tations can have on the well-being of older adults, research-
ers have had a long-standing interest in whether mobility
disability varies among groups defined by demographic
characteristics and socioeconomic status.
Typically, measures used to assess disparities in mobility
disability have been based on self-reported answers to ques-
tions regarding difficulty with various activities. Many sur-
veys of older adults, for example, ask whether a respondent
has difficulty (and if so, how much difficulty) with tasks
such as walking 200­300 m, walking across a room, going
up stairs, or getting into or out of a bed or chair. Responses
to these types of questions often vary by such factors as age,
sex, marital status, or socioeconomic status, suggesting the
presence of disparities in mobility limitations.
However, differential understanding and use of self-
reported response categories may contribute to these dispari-
ties (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, & van Doorslaer, 2008; Bago
d'Uva, van Doorslaer, Lindeboom, & O'Donnell, 2008;
Iburg, Salomon, Tandon, & Murray, 2001; Lindeboom &
van Doorslaer, 2004). For instance, two individuals with the
same underlying level of mobility function may report dif-
ferent levels of difficulty with mobility-related tasks be-
cause they may not have the same ideas and attitudes about
what defines difficulty (Melzer, Lan, Tom, Deeg, & Guralnik,
2004). Differences in reporting difficulty also could result
from varying expectations about health, differences in liv-
ing environments that affect the ability to perform tasks, or
from dissimilarities in the use of or access to combinations
of personal and technological assistance with mobility-
related activities (Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer, et al.,
2008; Melzer et al., 2004; Murray, Tandon, Salomon,
Mathers, & Sadana, 2003; Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003;
Salomon, Tandon, Murray; World Health Survey Pilot
Study Collaborating Group, 2004). In turn, these causes for
differences in reporting behaviors may vary by individual
characteristics resulting in systematic differences in report-
ing patterns and what is often referred to as reporting het-
erogeneity (Shmueli, 2003) or response category cut-point

Objectives. This study assesses whether socioeconomic and demographic differences in reported mobility limitations
are attributable to differential perceptions of mobility difficulty that result in the differential use of response categories.
Methods. Data come from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study and its parent study, the Taiwan
Longitudinal Study of Aging. Ordered probit models with person-specific cut-points are used to test whether, after con-
trolling for underlying mobility using objective performance measures, cut-points for reporting mobility limitations vary
across groups defined by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
Results. Age is the only characteristic that is consistently associated with the location of the cut-points for reporting
mobility difficulty: At the same level of underlying mobility difficulty, older adults are more likely than younger adults
are to report difficulty with all tasks except short walks. Other variables showed differences but only for one specific
activity, for example, urban residents are more likely to report difficulty running than are rural residents with the same
underlying level of mobility function.
Discussion. For most mobility activities, there are no systematic differences in the perception of difficulty by individual
characteristics. Thus, for older Taiwanese adults, differences in mobility limitations associated with socioeconomic status are
more likely to reflect underlying differences in function than differences in how these groups report the same capacity.The usual
loss of mobility with age, however, reflects both a decrease in capacity and a lowering of the threshold for reporting difficulty.

(threshold) shifts (Murray et al., 2003). For example, be-
cause income can afford many advantages, older adults with
higher incomes may believe that they should be in good
health. As a result, older adults with higher incomes may
have higher thresholds for reporting difficulty (i.e., are less
willing to acknowledge having difficulty) than older adults
with lower incomes who may have lower expectations for
health. Alternatively, the higher expectations of higher in-
come adults could result in small problems making them feel
that they are having difficulty, resulting in lower thresholds.
Cut-point shifts occur when, at a given level of "true" or
underlying health, population subgroups systematically pro-
vide different evaluations of their health (Lindeboom & van
Doorslaer, 2004; Murray et al., 2003; Shmueli, 2003). For
example, Figure 1 shows how the same level of actual mo-
bility functioning can be mapped into different categories of
a three-category ordered response variable for difficulty
walking (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Iburg et al.,
2001; Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003; Salomon et al., 2004;
Tandon, Murray, Salomon, & King, 2003). The centerline
represents the unobserved underlying level of difficulty
walking a short distance. The scale on the left shows re-
sponse category thresholds (t1 and t2) for men and the scale
on the right shows the thresholds for women. The thresholds
mark the levels of underlying mobility limitation at which
an individual will choose one category over another (Bago
d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Iburg et al., 2001; King,
Murray, Salomon, & Tandon, 2004; Murray et al., 2003;
Salomon et al., 2004). The lower thresholds mark the boundar-
ies for reporting no difficulty with walking versus any diffi-
culty with walking. The higher thresholds indicate the
ability level for which a respondent would report the inabil-
ity to walk rather than difficulty with walking. Given the
true level of mobility indicated by the dotted line in Figure 1,
a male respondent would report no difficulty, whereas a
female respondent would indicate having difficulty. (Note
that although Figure 1 shows that both thresholds are lower
for women than for men, it is possible that one threshold
could be lower and one higher; Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell,
et al., 2008; Lindeboom & van Doorslaer, 2004.)
This analysis focuses on cut-point shifts in reporting mo-
bility difficulty among older adults. Are differences in re-
ported mobility difficulty attributable to differential
perceptions of health that result in the differential use of
response categories? We examine whether cut-points for re-
porting mobility limitations among older Taiwanese adults
differ across demographic and socioeconomic groups.
Background
In addition to measurement error, variation in reports
of difficulty is driven by two factors (King et al., 2004;
Salomon, Tandon, Murray; World Health Survey Pilot Study
Collaborating Group, 2003; Shmueli, 2003). First, reports of
mobility difficulty are a function of underlying physiological
capacity (King et al., 2004; Salomon, Tandon, et al., 2003;
Shmueli, 2003; see also Freedman, 2009 and Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994). Second, as the previous discussion of Figure 1
suggests, self-reports of mobility difficulty are also influ-
enced by perceptions of difficulty that reflect differences in
health expectations as well as differences in social and phys-
ical environments. These perceptions affect the translation of
capacity into reports of difficulty. Demographic and socio-
economic disparities in measures of self-reported mobility
difficulty, therefore, can emerge from group differences in
underlying capacity and from group differences in percep-
tions of difficulty that result in cut-point shifts (King et al.,
2004; Salomon, Tandon, et al., 2003; Shmueli, 2003).
Research on older adults that examines socioeconomic
status and demographic variation in reports of mobility dif-
ficulty using techniques such as ordered logit or probit mod-
els assumes that all respondents use the same scale or criteria
to define difficulty and, therefore, does not account for cut-
point shifts (Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003; Salomon,
Tandon, et al., 2003; Tandon et al., 2003). In other words,
all cross-group differences in reports of mobility difficulty
are attributed to underlying mobility capacity, and the po-
tential influence of differing perceptions is ignored. Results
from such studies, therefore, may reflect both group differ-
ences in underlying capacity and group differences in the
translation of capacity into reports of difficulty. Disregard-
ing the association between demographic and socioeco-
nomic characteristics and cut-points can lead to under- or
overestimation of cross-population differences in underly-
ing mobility capacity in the cross-section and changes in
capacity over time (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008;
Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer, et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2003;
Tandon et al., 2003). Studies that assume that respondents
use difficulty scales in an identical manner cannot isolate
and make cross-population comparisons of mobility capac-
ity (some might argue that capacity is the preferred measure
of health for cross-population comparisons; Salomon,

PERCEPTIONS OF MOBILITY DIFFICULTY 239
Mathers, et al., 2003). These studies, however, can identify
disparities in the disablement process, specifically dispari-
ties in the manifestation of capacity in the social and physi-
cal environment (Salomon, Mathers, et al., 2003).
A complementary line of research focuses on socioeco-
nomic and demographic variation in perceptions of diffi-
culty that results in cut-point shifts. The detection of
cut-point shifts is rooted in a method that uses exogenous
objective measures of health to fix the level of ability or
standardize the underlying mobility scale so that remaining
differences in reported difficulty can be attributed to cut-
point shifts (Tandon et al., 2003). To analyze cut-point shifts,
researchers have extended standard ordered probit models to
allow the cut-points to vary by individual characteristics
(King et al., 2004; Tandon et al., 2003). However, it is not
possible to tease out the effects of a covariate on latent mo-
bility capacity and on the cut-points without additional in-
formation or identifying assumptions (Tandon et al., 2003).
One school of work has used objective mobility perfor-
mance tests in the hope that these measures capture the ef-
fects of background variables on latent mobility, leaving
only their effects on the cut-points. Iburg and colleagues
(2001) use seven measured performance tests to control for
latent mobility in assessing the effect of background charac-
teristics on the cut-points for self-reported and physician-
assessed mobility ability. Melzer and colleagues (2004) use
the MOBLI index of mobility limitations as a control in as-
sessing cut-point shifts by age, sex, race, income, and edu-
cation. Although these studies identify the presence (or
absence) of cut-point shifts, it is possible that some socio
demographic differences in cut-points may also reflect
sociodemographic differences in underlying capacity.
Nonetheless, these studies provide insights into disparities in
mobility difficulty by establishing whether part of the variation
is attributable to differences in perceptions or how they are
reported. Systematic variation in cut-points by socioeconomic
and demographic characteristics indicates that perceptions play
a role in disparities of reported mobility difficulty. Conversely,
the absence of cut-point shifts across population subgroups,
such as sex, suggests that differences in reported difficulty
are more likely to reflect differences in underlying capacity
rather than differences in perceptions (Melzer et al., 2004).
Another school of work has supplemented self-reported
measures by preparing a set of vignettes intended to repre-
sent various levels of latent mobility and asking the respon-
dent to classify these vignettes using the same categories as
the self-reports (see Tandon et al., 2003 for details). Be-
cause all respondents classify the same vignettes, this addi-
tional information can be used to anchor the cut-points,
permitting estimation of the effects of the same covariate on
latent health and on the cut-points. However, because we do
not have vignettes, we rely on the same type of exclusion
restriction as the studies by Iburg and colleagues (2001) and
Melzer and colleagues (2004) and use two mobility perfor-
mance tests as controls in assessing differences in the per-
ception of the cut-points by a number of socioeconomic
status indicators and demographic characteristics.
This study expands on existing literature in a number of
ways. First, we examine reporting heterogeneity in Taiwan.
Because the translation of capacity into reports of difficulty
occurs within a social environment (Freedman, 2009), pat-
terns of cut-point shifts in Taiwan may differ from patterns
in countries that have different social support and health
care systems and different expectations for and beliefs about
health. Unlike many Western populations examined in other
studies of cut-point shifts, Taiwan has a social support sys-
tem for older adults based more on family support and
strong norms of familial obligation than on institutional or
public assistance (Knodel, Ofstedal, & Hermalin, 2002); a
universal health care system that supports the use of preven-
tive care and the use of both Western and traditional Chinese
medical providers (Ofstedal & Natividad, 2002); and beliefs
about health and well-being that are influenced by several
Chinese philosophies and religions, including Taoism, Bud-
dhism, Confucianism, and the belief in Yin and Yang or the
balance within one's body and between the body and the
environment (Chen, 2000; Lai & Surood, 2009). Examining
cut-point shifts in a new setting will provide more insights
into the role that the social and cultural context plays in the
reporting of mobility limitations by older adults.
Second, we examine the potential effects of perceptions
for multiple mobility-related activities. With some excep-
tions (e.g., Iburg et al., 2001), studies tend to focus on a sin-
gle measure of general or gross mobility function (e.g., Bago
d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer,
et al., 2008; Melzer et al., 2004). However, previous re-
search shows that variation in reporting behaviors may be
activity specific (Rahman & Liu, 2000; Shmueli, 2003).
Therefore, when evaluating the mobility ability of older pop-
ulations, it is important to know whether and how reporting
differences may vary across specific mobility-related tasks.
Finally, we test for perceptual differences in mobility dif-
ficulty across infrequently examined demographic groups.
Although previous research has also investigated health dis-
parities by marital status and urban/rural residence, fewer
studies have examined whether reporting heterogeneity ex-
ists for groups defined by these characteristics. The present
study, therefore, also will shed additional light on whether
differences in mobility difficulty by urban residence and
marital status are more likely to reflect differences in capac-
ity or a combination of capacity and perceptions.
Methods
Data
The data used for the present analyses came from the So-
cial Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS)
and its parent study, the Taiwan Longitudinal Study ofAging
(TLSA). TLSA was first conducted in 1989 on a nationally
CORNMAN ET AL.
240
representative sample of persons aged 60 and older (Hermalin,
Liang, & Chang, 1989). Follow-up interviews have been
conducted approximately every three years. The original
1989 sample has been extended twice to include a randomly
selected representative sample of adults aged 50­66 years in
1996 and a randomly selected representative sample of
adults aged 50­56 years in 2003. The first wave of SEBAS
was conducted in 2000 and included a randomly selected
subset of respondents interviewed in the 1999 wave of
TLSA. SEBAS included both an in-home interview and a
hospital-based physical exam (see Goldman et al., 2004 for
a description of SEBAS). The sample for the second wave of
SEBAS, which was conducted in 2006, consisted of the sur-
viving exam participants from the first wave of SEBAS and
a randomly selected sample of respondents who first entered
the TLSA study in 2003.
Our analyses focused on the 2006 wave of SEBAS, the
first wave in which physical performance measures of mo-
bility were collected. Of the 1,683 respondents eligible for
the 2006 SEBAS, 1,284 were interviewed, 219 were lost-to-
follow-up (LFU), and 180 died before the 2006 interview
(see Figure 2). The response rate for the entire 2006 sample,
therefore, was 85.4% (1,284 respondents of 1,503 respon-
dents who survived and were eligible for SEBAS II).
SEBAS I respondents who were LFU or who died between
2000 and 2006 were older, more likely to report difficulty
with mobility-related activities, and more likely to report
their ethnicity as Fukienese (vs. Hakka or Mainlander). At-
trition of SEBAS I participants was not significantly related
to sex or educational attainment. Respondents from the
2003 wave of the TLSA who were LFU or who died before
being interviewed were more likely to be Fukienese but
were no different from interviewed respondents in terms of
age, sex, education, or mobility ability. Sample attrition,
therefore, could result in under- or overestimation of cut-
point differences by age and between ethnic groups.
The final analysis sample excluded respondents who
were missing data on key indicators. We excluded 39 cases
that were missing either the performance-based measures
(n = 31) or the self-reported mobility measures (n = 8) and
an additional 54 cases missing covariates of interest. The
resulting analysis sample contained 1,191 Taiwanese adults
aged 53­94 years.
Measures
Performance-based measures.--Analyses adjusted for
underlying mobility function by incorporating two widely
used measures of physical performance as the exogenous
objective measures of mobility capacity: a timed 3-m walk
and timed chair stands, both performed in the respondent's
home. Respondents were asked to walk a distance of 3 m at
their usual walking speed. Because of space limitations, 12
respondents walked fewer than 3 m. For these respondents,
who walked between 2 and 2.5 m, we scaled the time up
proportionally. Respondents were allowed to use assistive
devices if needed. Each respondent was timed for two
walks. The Pearson correlation between the two walks was
.9. Based on standard practices in the literature, the faster of
the two walks was used (see, e.g., Guralnik et al., 2000;
Rivera, Fried, Weiss, & Simonsick, 2008).
For the chair stand test, respondents were asked to stand
up and sit down from an armless, straight back chair with a
hard seat five times as quickly as possible. The back of the

chair was placed against the wall and respondents were
asked to keep their arms folded across their chest as they did
the exercise. Respondents were timed from the starting
seated position to the final standing position at the end of
the fifth stand. Chair heights differed from home to home.
Exploratory regressions of chair stand completion times on
chair height, controlling for age, sex, and respondent's
height, revealed that chair height was significantly associ-
ated with completion times (results not shown). Chair stand
test results, therefore, were adjusted to account for the vari-
ation in chair height. We regressed chair stand time on chair
height, person height, and age separately for men and
women. Based on these results, we adjust the observed
completion time as follows:
( )
i i i
c c h h
= + -
,
where ci
represents the observed completion time for indi-
vidual i, b is the coefficient for chair height, h is the mean
chair height across the entire sample, and hi
is the height of
the chair used by the individual.
Some respondents did not complete the timed walk or
chair stand tests, most often for health or safety reasons. In
order to include these respondents, we analyzed a number
of different specifications of the timed walk and chair stand
measures (results not shown). These analyses showed that
(1) results were sensitive to the inclusion of those who could
not perform the tests; (2) completion times for the walk and
chair stand tests had a nonlinear relationship with the under-
lying level of mobility capacity; and (3) a small number of
outliers on each test influenced this relationship. We, there-
fore, included for each performance measure a log transfor-
mation of the time it took to complete the test and a dummy
variable indicating whether a respondent was unable to per-
form the test. We also examined a model including for each
performance measure a linear term, quadratic term, and an
indicator for inability (data not shown), but cut-point results
varied little compared with the model using the log transfor-
mations. If a performance test was not completed because a
respondent or the respondent's family refused, the timed
walk and chair stand measures were considered missing,
and these respondents were excluded from analyses.
Self-reported mobility.--We examined cut-point shifts in
activities that require lower extremity function as a major
component: running a short distance (20­30 m), walking
200­300 m, walking up two or three flights of stairs, squat-
ting, and lifting or carrying something that weighs 11­12
kg. Respondents also reported on difficulty moving about
the house and getting out of bed/standing up/sitting in a
chair. However, because too few respondents reported dif-
ficulty with these activities, statistical models (described
below) could not be run for these outcomes. For each of the
other five activities, respondents were asked if they had any
difficulty doing the activity and, if so, how much (some dif-
ficulty, great difficulty, or unable to do the activity). The
small number of respondents reporting great difficulty pre-
vented us from examining reporting differences across all
four categories. Therefore, we examined cut-point differ-
ences between no difficulty (coded as 0), some or great dif-
ficulty (coded as 1), and unable to perform the task (coded
as 2).
Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.--We
examined cut-point shifts for groups defined by demo-
graphic characteristics, including age (53­64, 65­74, and
75 years or older), sex, marital status (currently married vs.
not currently married), residence in an urban versus rural
area, and ethnicity (Fukienese, Hakka, and Mainlander).
Ethnic groups have been defined, in part, by the timing of
their migration to Taiwan and the point of origin on main-
land China. The Fukienese, coming from the southern
Fukien province, and the Hakka, coming from the eastern
Kwangtung province, began their migration from Mainland
China as early as the 1600s (Lamely, 1981). A third wave of
Chinese migration from Mainland China, beginning in
1949, consisted of nationalist military soldiers and nonmil-
itary supporters of the nationalist government (Mainlanders;
Hermalin, Ofstedal, & Chang, 1996).
We also investigated whether reporting behaviors dif-
fered by socioeconomic status as measured by (1) the
respondent's and, if married, the spouse's monthly income
(measured in 2003 and categorized in quartiles) and (2) the
respondent's education (no formal education, primary, sec-
ondary, and postsecondary education).
Statistical Procedures
To examine whether demographic and socioeconomic
differences in reported mobility difficulty are attributable to
differential perceptions of mobility that result in the differ-
ential use of response categories, we use an ordered probit
model that allows the cut-points to depend on individual
characteristics (Bago d'Uva, van Doorslaer, et al., 2008;
Iburg et al., 2001; King et al., 2004; Melzer et al., 2004;
Tandon et al., 2003). The model is based on the assumptions
that (1) there is an unobserved continuous latent variable *
i
Y
that represents an individual's perceived mobility level; (2)
*
i
Y is normally distributed with a mean mi
and variance of 1
and reflects the true underlying mobility level plus measure-
ment error; and (3) mi
is a function of a series of objective
performance measures Xi
(Iburg et al., 2001; King et al.,
2004; Melzer et al., 2004; Tandon et al., 2003). Formally,

, are modeled as a function of individ-
ual characteristics (Iburg et al., 2001; King et al., 2004;
Melzer et al., 2004; Tandon et al., 2003), so that:

Z is a row vector containing the individual-level
characteristics, g is a coefficient vector reflecting differ-
ences in the location of the first threshold, and d is a coeffi-
cient vector reflecting differences in the distance between
the two thresholds (King et al., 2004). Therefore, unlike a
standard ordered probit model that ignores the potential in-
fluence of perceptions on reports of difficulty, this model
accounts for the effect of perceptions by allowing the trans-
lation of mobility capacity into categories of the self-
reported mobility measures (i.e., the cut-points) to vary by
individual characteristics.
An important caveat is that the model assumes that, once
we have controlled for the performance measures, socio-
economic characteristics are not associated with actual mo-
bility functioning. If this assumption is incorrect, some of
the cross-group differences in the cut-points could reflect
differences in underlying capacity as well as perceptual dif-
ferences in mobility difficulty.
The estimates of b, g, and d are derived using maximum
likelihood methods, based on the assumption that responses
are independent across study participants. A significant coef-
ficient for a predictor of the cut-point between no difficulty
and any difficulty, ti1, indicates that, controlling for the per-
formance measures, the threshold for reporting difficulty var-
ies by the predictor under examination. A significant d
coefficient signifies that, given the objective level of perfor-
mance, the distance between the difficulty and inability cut-
points (ti2 - ti1) differs by the characteristic of interest. For
example, a significant negative coefficient for being female
for the difficulty cut-point, with no effect on the perceived
distance between the two cut-points (e.g., a significant g coef-
ficient and a nonsignificant d coefficient), indicates that
women have a lower threshold than men for reporting both
difficulty and inability to complete a task. This scenario is
depicted in Figure 1 in which the location of the cut-points for
reporting difficulty, t1, and inability, t2, are lower for women
than for men, but the distance between the first and second
cut-point, t2 - t1, is the same for men and women. Thus, at
the same level of underlying performance, women are more
likely than men to report difficulty or inability with a task.
For each self-reported mobility outcome, we run a single
model that includes the two performance measures to control
for underlying mobility and simultaneously examines the ef-
fects of all socioeconomic and demographic covariates on the
cut-points. For cut-point predictors with multiple categories--
such as ethnicity, which has three--we perform a Wald
test with a chi-square distribution to determine whether
any of the categories differs from the others (StataCorp,
2007). Models are run in Stata 10.0 using the Generalized
Linear Latent and Mixed Models procedure (Rabe-Hesketh,
Skrondal, & Pickles, 2004; StataCorp, 2007).
Results
Table 1 shows the distribution of the self-reported mobil-
ity difficulty measures overall and by sociodemographic
characteristics. Overall, approximately 9%­16% of respon-
dents report difficulty with a specific mobility-related activ-
ity (running, walking, going up stairs, squatting, and lifting
or carrying 11­12 kg; see Table 1). The percentage report-
ing inability in an activity varies more widely, with as many
as 18% reporting they are unable to run 20­30 m and as few
as 8% reporting that they are unable to walk 200­300 m or
walk up several flights of stairs.
The average time to walk 3 m is 4.3 s (SD = 3.1), with
4.6% of respondents being unable to perform the test (data
not shown). The average time to perform five chair stands is
10.9 s (SD = 4.6), with 10.7% of respondents unable to do
the test (data not shown).
Reported difficulty with each of the five mobility-related
activities varies significantly by sociodemographic charac-
teristics (Table 1). For all five activities, difficulty differs by
age, sex, marital status, income, and educational attainment.
Specifically, reported difficulty increases with age, is worse
for women than for men, and worse for respondents not cur-
rently married compared with currently married respon-
dents. Reported difficulty is negatively associated with both
income and education. In addition, difficulty running 20­30 m
differs significantly by ethnicity (Mainlanders have the
most difficulty), and walking up stairs differs by urban-rural
residence, with residents of rural areas reporting more dif-
ficulty.
The results of tests for differences in thresholds for re-
porting impairment are shown in Table 2. In general, there
is variation in the location of the threshold for reporting dif-
ficulty, t1, but no significant differences in the spread of the
thresholds for reporting difficulty and inability (i.e., no dif-
ferences in log(t2 - t1)). Older adults have significantly
lower thresholds for reporting difficulty versus no difficulty
for all mobility-related activities except walking 200­300
m (for which differences in t1 across age groups are not
significant; c2 = 4.17, p = .12). In other words, older adults
are more likely to report difficulty with most mobility-
related activities than are their younger counterparts with
the same mobility capacity.
Differences across other groups are less consistent. At the
same level of function, women are more likely than men to

PERCEPTIONS OF MOBILITY DIFFICULTY 245
report difficulty lifting and carrying heavy objects (i.e.,
women have lower thresholds than men). Hakka have
higher thresholds than Mainlanders for reporting difficulty
running a short distance and are, therefore, less likely to
report difficulty with running than are Mainlanders with the
same underlying ability. More educated respondents also
have higher thresholds for reporting difficulty with running
than their less educated counterparts. Urban residents, how-
ever, have lower thresholds for reports of difficulty with
running. Thus, at the same level of underlying difficulty,
urban residents are more likely to report running difficulty
than are rural residents. Thresholds do not differ signifi-
cantly by income.
Although there are no significant differences in the spread
between cut-points, significant differences in the location of
the first threshold imply that inability thresholds are also
(1) lower for older adults in reports of inability to perform
all mobility activities except walking a short distance;
(2) lower for women than for men in reporting the inability
to lift and carry heavy objects; (3) higher for Hakka than
Mainlanders and for more educated than for less educated
respondents in reports of the inability to run; and (4) lower
for urban than for rural respondents in reporting the inability
to run.
Discussion
We identify cut-point differences in reporting mobility
difficulty for groups defined by various demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics. Two clear patterns emerge
from the results. First, the location of thresholds for report-
ing difficulty versus no difficulty differs across some demo-
graphic and socioeconomic status groups but the spread
between the thresholds for difficulty and inability do not.
Perceptions, therefore, may have an effect on the absolute
position of the thresholds but do not have an effect on the
positioning of the thresholds relative to each other. Second,
age emerges as the only characteristic that is consistently
associated with difficulty cut-points. In the presence of con-
trols for mobility capacity, older adults have lower thresh-
olds for reporting impairment. In other words, at the same
level of mobility performance, older adults are more likely
than younger adults to report difficulty. Other respondent
characteristics are not consistently related to reports of dif-
ficulty or inability for the mobility-related activities we ex-
amine. Therefore, with the exception of age differences,
most of the socioeconomic and demographic differences in
mobility difficulty reported in Table 1 are more likely to
reflect differences in capacity rather than differences in per-
ceptions that result in cut-point shifts.
Our results regarding age differences in thresholds for re-
porting mobility difficulty are consistent with findings from
several studies. In both this study and the Melzer and col-
leagues (2004) study on older adults in the United States,
younger respondents, compared with older respondents,
tend to be more physically impaired before mobility diffi-
culty is reported. Similarly, using the vignette approach,
Boga d'Uva, O'Donnell and colleagues (2008) find that
younger adults in China, India, and Indonesia are more
likely than older adults with similar levels of actual mobility
to report no difficulty moving around. These results suggest
that younger and older adults may have different expecta-
tions for their health. Although older adults may find it ac-
ceptable to respond that they have difficulty, younger adults
may not. Differences in reporting behaviors by age could
also result from systematic age differences in the propensity
to use assistive devices, in the availability and use of per-
sonal assistance, or in environmental demands (Melzer
et al., 2004). It is also possible that these age differences
may reflect cohort changes in perceptions of and expecta-
tions for health. Although the current generation of older
adults has large families, low levels of education, and often
worked in agriculture, future generations of elderly will
have fewer children, more education, and more varied work
experiences (Knodel et al., 2002). It will be interesting to
see whether and how reporting heterogeneity changes over
time in Taiwan.
Because patterns of cut-point shifts differ across the tasks
we examine, our findings indicate that cut-point shifts are
sensitive to the activity under review. For instance, we find
differences by sex only for carrying 11­12 kg and urban-
rural differences in thresholds exist only for jogging a short
distance. Similarly, older adults have lower thresholds for
all activities except walking 200­300 m. These patterns of
reporting behavior could be related to the frequency with
which an activity is done (Rahman & Liu, 2000). Women
may not regularly carry heavy objects, and urban residents
may not jog very often. Walking is a fairly common task
for most older adults, but the other mobility-related activi-
ties examined here may be performed less often. Respon-
dents who do not perform certain tasks regularly may be
more likely to report difficulty than those who do the activ-
ity more often (Rahman & Liu, 2000). In a study of rural
Bangladeshi men and women, Rahman and Liu (2000)
found that differences by sex in reporting behaviors are larg-
est for gendered activities and smallest for gender-neutral
tasks.
Differences in reporting behaviors across tasks could also
be related to the sensitivity with which the walking and
chair stand tests capture the underlying functioning neces-
sary to perform the mobility-related outcomes in the study.
For example, we find the most sociodemographic differ-
ences in cut-points for running a short distance and no cut-
point shifts for walking 200­300 m, which requires less
exertion than running. Because we control specifically for
walking ability, the model may better account for the level
of functioning necessary for walking than for running. How-
ever, we also control for timed chair stands, which reflect,
among other things, an individual's level of exertion (Lord,
Murray, Chapman, Munro, & Tiedemann, 2002; Lindemann
CORNMAN ET AL.
246
et al., 2007). In fact, our results show that the chair stand test
is a better predictor of underlying mobility functioning than
is the walking test (see Supplementary Table 1) and, there-
fore, plays a more important role than the walking test in
assessing individual heterogeneity in cut-points.
In the context of previous work, our study results suggest
that reporting heterogeneity may be culture specific. Unlike
many other studies of socioeconomic and demographic dif-
ferences in thresholds for reporting mobility difficulty (e.g.,
Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, et al., 2008; Bago d'Uva, van
Doorslaer, et al., 2008; Iburg et al., 2001; Melzer et al.,
2004), we find little evidence of systematic differences in
reporting behaviors by sex, education, or income. Nor do
we find evidence for threshold differences by marital status
or urban residence. These differences across studies could
be related to the homogeneity of the study population. In
more homogeneous societies, cultural norms and values
could more strongly influence health-reporting behaviors
than do social or economic status, whereas the reverse may
be true in more culturally heterogeneous populations. In
Taiwan, dominant cultural norms and values are shaped by
Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist philosophies that stress,
among other things, family interests and obligations over
individual needs and the importance of balance and har-
mony between body and environment (Chen, 2000; Lai &
Surood, 2009). Previous research on health in Chinese cul-
ture suggests that, given these underpinnings of Chinese
society, older adults of Chinese descent may not only adapt
more readily to age-related illness and deficits than older
adults in Western societies but also may be more likely to
regard age-related health changes as an accepted part of grow-
ing older (see, e.g., Leung, Wu, Lue, & Tang, 2004 and Ikles,
1998). As a result, many potential sources of socioeconomic
and demographic differences in reporting behaviors--such as
differences in health expectations, access to personal assis-
tance and/or assistive technology, or living conditions with
varying environmental demands--may be less relevant to
reporting behaviors in Taiwan. However, as previously sug-
gested, the age differences we report could indicate that
cohort differences in reporting behaviors are emerging.
Changing familial, educational, and work experiences of
Taiwanese adults could lead to a shift in the relative influ-
ence of cultural norms versus social or economic status on
reporting behaviors.
This research also points to the utility of collecting infor-
mation on both self-reported mobility difficulty and mobil-
ity capacity as measured by physical performance tests.
Self-reports of mobility difficulty are based on both under-
lying physiological capacity and perceptions of difficulty
(King et al., 2004; Salomon, Tandon, et al., 2003; Shmueli,
2003; see also Freedman, 2009 and Verbrugge & Jette,
1994). These difficulty measures, therefore, reflect an
individual's belief of how well they have adapted to func-
tional deficits within the environments in which they live.
However, without measures of capacity, it is not possible to
determine whether the translation of capacity into difficulty
also reflects perceptions. At the same time, performance
measures of capacity alone do not speak to whether or how
well individuals may have adapted to functional limitations
(Guralnik, Branch, Cummings, &, Curb, 1989). To fully un-
derstand the causes of, and potential interventions for mo-
bility disability and disparities in mobility disability,
information on both capacity and self-reported difficulty are
needed.
There are several limitations to this study. Although we
are able to detect whether there are threshold differences in
reporting mobility problems for groups defined by demo-
graphic characteristics and socioeconomic status, the iden-
tification of effects in our model comes from two
assumptions: First, the relatively mild assumption that the
performance tests have no effect on the cut-points within
groups defined by the background characteristics and sec-
ond, the stronger assumption that the background character-
istics have no effect on true latent mobility after controlling
for the performance measures. If the objective tests fail to
fully control for the effects of background characteristics,
our estimates of cut-point shifts may reflect in part some
differences in underlying mobility capacity. On the other
hand, studies that ignore cut-point shifts attribute all ob-
served differences to underlying capacity. We are also lim-
ited by having few respondents who reported difficulty with
walking across a room or transferring in or out of a bed or
chair, so we could not run the statistical models for these
outcomes. Both of these activities frequently appear in ag-
ing surveys; it would be useful to understand whether there
are differences in reporting behaviors for these tasks. Fi-
nally, because cultural differences in the aging experience
affect analyses of cut-point shifts, these results cannot be
generalized beyond the older Taiwanese population. The re-
sults do indicate, however, that future analyses of disability
disparities in other settings need to account for or address
the potential effects of reporting heterogeneity.
Mobility disability is most often assessed using self-
reported responses to questions that ask respondents to indi-
cate how much difficulty they have doing such tasks as
jogging, walking 200­300 m, going up stairs, walking
across the room, and the like. In general, the criteria respon-
dents use to decide and report whether they have difficulty
with an activity are unknown. Two individuals with the
same underlying mobility ability, therefore, may have dif-
ferent perceptions of what constitutes difficulty, resulting in
different reports of the level of difficulty with mobility
tasks. The analyses presented here control for measured
performance tests to detect whether perceptions of mobility
difficulty vary across population subgroups. In general,
with the exception of threshold differences across age
groups, we find relatively little evidence of cut-point shifts
for reporting mobility difficulty or inability among older
Taiwanese adults. Therefore, within this population, differ-
ences in mobility limitations by sex, socioeconomic status,
PERCEPTIONS OF MOBILITY DIFFICULTY 247
marital status, or urban residence are more likely to reflect
differences in mobility capacity rather than differences in
reporting behaviors stemming from varying perceptions of
difficulty. The usual loss of mobility with age, however, re-
flects both a decrease in capacity and a lowering of the
threshold for reporting difficulty.
