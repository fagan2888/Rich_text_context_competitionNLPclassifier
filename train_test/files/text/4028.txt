Abstract
Objective: To explore the link between leucoaraiosis and recovery of neurological function in
elderly patients with acute cerebral infarction.
Methods: The study included elderly patients, hospitalized with acute cerebral infarction.
Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed before or within 5 days after admission;
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging
sequence data were collected. Using the Fazekas scale, leucoaraiosis (white matter hyperintensity
[WMH]) was graded as 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) for all participants.
Results: The study included 279 patients. WMH grades of 0, 1, 2 and 3 were seen in 27 (9.67%), 90
(32.26%), 104 (37.28%) and 58 cases (20.79%) respectively. Improvement on the National Institutes
of Health Stroke Scale for neurological impairment was negatively associated with WMH grade.
Patients with severe leucoaraiosis at hospital admission had worse neurological functional recovery
and a higher rate of self-care incapability compared with those with mild or no leucoaraiosis.
Conclusions: The results suggest that severe leucoaraiosis in elderly patients with acute cerebral
infarction is associated with poor prognosis and poor recovery of neurological function.

Introduction
Research shows that the degree of leucoar-
aiosis can predict 90-day clinical outcomes
in patients with acute aortic occlusion.1­3
Furthermore, acute cerebral infarction
(stroke) patients with severe leucoaraiosis
in the deep white matter is associated with a
high risk of brain parenchymal haematoma
after mechanical embolectomy.4 Acute cere-
bral infarction patients with leucoaraiosis
have a much higher incidence of haemor-
rhagic transformation after thrombolytic
therapy compared with patients without
leucoaraiosis.5 Leucoaraiosis has therefore
been proposed as an important risk factor
for a poor prognosis in stroke patients.2,6
However, few studies have focused on the
association between leucoariosis and the
prognosis of cerebral infarction in elderly
patients.7,8 In the present study, associations
between the degree of brain white matter
hyperintensity (WMH) and clinical progno-
sis, neurological function recovery and self-
care capability after treatment were ana-
lysed in elderly patients with acute cerebral
infarction.2
Patients and methods
Patient selection and examinations
All elderly patients with acute cerebral
infarction hospitalized in Beijing Military
General Hospital between January and
December 2007 were included in the study;
those with cerebral haemorrhage, subarach-
noid haemorrhage or other nonstroke-
related conditions were excluded. All
patients provided written informed consent
prior to participation. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Beijing Military General Hospital.
Patients were admitted to hospital within
7 days of symptom onset. All hospitalized
patients with acute cerebral infarction met
the diagnostic criteria of the 4th Chinese
Cerebrovascular Diseases Conference
(1995). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
examination was performed before or within
5 days after admission, using a Signa 1.5 T
(GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK)
superconducting system. T1-weighted,
T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted
imaging sequences were obtained.
Diffusion-weighted imaging confirmed vis-
ible fresh infarction lesions in all enrolled
patients.
Within 5 days after hospital admission,
MRI FLAIR images were examined by two
independent neurologists (W.W. and J-J.G.)
who were unfamiliar with the patient's clin-
ical condition. Using the Fazekas method,
brain WMH was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild),
2 (moderate) or 3 (severe).
Each patient's scores on the National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
for neurological impairment were evaluated
on days 1, 7 and 14 after admission and on
the day of discharge. Each patient was also
evaluated for the degree of disability or
dependence in their daily activities using the
modified Rankin scale (mRS) on the day of
discharge; each patient was recorded as
having either self-care capability (mRS 2)
or self-care incapability (mRS !3).
After admission, all patients received
standardized treatment regimens based on
the Chinese guidelines for cerebrovascular
disease prevention and treatment for
stroke.9,10
All clinical investigations were conducted
according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 13.0 (SPSSÕ, Chicago,
858 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
IL, USA). All quantitative values were
expressed as mean Æ SD. Because patients'
NIHSS scores were not normally distribu-
ted, the Kruskal­Wallis method for non-
parametric testing was used to analyse the
associations between WMH grade and
neurological function. 2-test or Fisher's
exact test were used to analyse differences
between groups in risk-factor frequencies.
Student's t-test was used to analyse differ-
ences between groups in quantitative vari-
ables. Unconditional logistic analyses were
performed to investigate risk factors asso-
ciated with clinical outcome; patients' living
skills (measured as the mRS score), age, sex,
WMH grade, admission NIHSS score and
improvement in NIHSS score were included
as independent variables. A P-value of
<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
The study enrolled 279 patients (191 male
and 88 female; age range 65­94 [mean
73.11 Æ 10.32]) years. WMH grade 0 was
seen in 27 (9.67%), grade 1 in 90 (32.26%),
grade 2 in 104 (37.28%) and grade 3 in 58
patients (20.79%). No significant correl-
ations between NIHSS score and brain
white matter change were found in patients
with different WMH grades on days 1, 7 and
14 after admission or on the day of discharge
(Table 1).
The NIHSS score improvements between
baseline (before admission) and 7 days after
admission (P ¼ 0.024) and between baseline
and discharge (P ¼ 0.021) were negatively
associated with WMH grade. The NIHSS
score improvements between baseline and 14
days after admission showed a similar trend,
but the P-value was slightly higher
(P ¼ 0.047). Pairwise comparison showed
that the NIHSS score improvement between
different timepoints after admission in the
group with a WMH grade of 3 was smaller
than that in the group with a WMH grade of
0 (P < 0.05) (Table 1).
At the time of discharge, stroke patients
who had severe leucoaraiosis on admission

(WMH grade !2) had a high probability of
self-care incapability (P < 0.05). The mor-
tality rate tended to increase with increasing
WMH grade, but no significant difference
was observed (Table 2).
Results of the logistic regression analysis
showed that the NIHSS score on the day of
admission (odds ratio [OR] 3.517, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 2.782, 6.443) and
WMH grade on the day of admission (OR
3.702, 95% CI 2.639, 5.445) were independ-
ent factors predicting the patient's self-care
incapability on the day of discharge.
Discussion
In the present study we found that elderly
stroke patients with severe leucoaraiosis at
the time of admission (WMH grade !2) had
a high probability of self-care incapability
after treatment (P < 0.05). The NIHSS score
improvement was also negatively associated
with the patients' leucoaraiosis severity
(P < 0.05). Mortality tended to increase
with WMH grade, but not significantly.
Thus, we suggest that severe leucoaraiosis
was associated with poor prognosis in eld-
erly stroke patients.
Leucoaraiosis is an independent predic-
tion factor for stroke.2,11 After the first
infarct, patients with severe leucoaraiosis
had a higher risk of recurrence of stroke
than those without leucoaraiosis or with
mild leucoaraiosis.2,11 However, few studies
have focused on the association between
brain leucoaraiosis and prognosis in stroke
patients; results are inconclusive.12 Thus, we
suggest that severe leucoaraiosis is asso-
ciated with poor prognosis in elderly stroke
patients. Furthermore, the NIHSS score and
WMH grade on the day of admission were
independent risk factors for clinical outcome
in elderly stroke patients.
Among patients with transient ischaemic
attack and lacunar infarction, the stroke
recurrence rate in those with leucoaraiosis
was 60% higher than in those without
leucoaraiosis.13 Leucoaraiosis is known to
be associated with cognitive impairment,14
gait and balance impairment,15 mood
changes and depression, urinary incontin-
ence, decline in daily living capability16 and
other clinical manifestations. Podgorska
et al.12 studied 370 patients with acute
stroke and analysed the association between
patient prognosis and leucoaraiosis severity.
They found that the 1-year mortality rate
was significantly higher in patients with, than
in those without, leucoaraiosis.12 However,
no significant difference in mortality was
observed 30 days after clinical onset.12
In the present study, no significant dif-
ference was observed in mortality in patients
with or without leucoaraiosis during the
period of hospitalization. These results are
consistent with those of Podgorska et al.12
However, in the present study stroke
patients with leucoaraiosis had a higher

rate of self-care incapability than patients
without leucoaraiosis, so the difference in
mortality between our study and that of
Podgorska et al.12 may be related to a
difference in the methods used to evaluate
self-care incapability.12
Leucoaraiosis had a substantial impact
on the patients' neurological functional
recovery and self-care capability in the pre-
sent study. Studies have shown that leucoar-
aiosis volume is an independent predictor of
infarct size in stroke patients.17 This is
probably one reason why acute infarction
patients who also have leucoaraiosis have a
poor prognosis. In addition, patients with
severe leucoaraiosis often also have cerebro-
vascular disease and cognitive dysfunction,
which may affect functional recovery.18 It
has been shown that long-term mortality
and the incidence of pneumonia are greater
in neurology outpatients who have leucoar-
aiosis than in those without leucoaraiosis.19
Furthermore, patients with leucoaraiosis are
susceptible to lung and urinary tract infec-
tions, which might also be linked to their
poor prognosis.19
In conclusion, Chinese elderly patients
with acute infarction and severe leucoaraio-
sis had a poorer prognosis than those with-
out leucoaraiosis or with minor
leucoaraiosis, in the present study. Dufouil
et al.20 showed that positive blood-pressure
control can reverse or slow the progress of
leucoaraiosis; their study20 has brought new
hope for the prevention and treatment of
leucoaraiosis.
