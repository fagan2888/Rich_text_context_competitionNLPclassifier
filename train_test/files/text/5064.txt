Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the relationship between pro-atherogenic biomarkers and epicardial
adipose tissue (EAT) thickness in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods: Plasma nitric oxide (NO), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and malondialde-
hyde (MDA) levels, EAT thickness, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and carotid intima media
thickness (CIMT) were determined in patients aged >18 years who were referred for
echocardiography for heart ischemia or non-ischemic diseases. Cardiovascular risk factors
(Framingham score [FS] ! 20) were weighted.
Results: Hypertension, dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus were prevalent (!55% of
40 patients). Patients with FS ! 20 (n ¼ 21) showed significantly higher EAT and CIMT values.

Globally, MDA, CIMT, age, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and
FS were associated with EAT thickness. EATwas significantly associated with NO in patients with
FS ! 20. Significant differences in EAT thickness were found between patients stratified by NO
value, FMD, age, smoking status, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and FS. An EAT-associated
atherogenic risk (CIMT ! 1 mm) model was statistically significant when MDA and type 2 diabetes
mellitus were included.
Conclusion: EAT thickness was associated with MDA, CIMT, age, waist circumference, HDL-C
and FS globally, but with NO only in patients with FS!20. EAT may be used to identify vascular
damage stage, possibly influenced by MDA and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Introduction
Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a type of
visceral adipose tissue, produces molecules
that have angiocrine, vasomotor and pro-
inflammatory effects and regulate blood
flow to the coronary arteries.1 The gener-
ation of reactive oxygen species parallels the
production of pro-inflammatory mediators,
and both exert synergistic damage on the
endothelium in patients with high cardio-
vascular risk.2
Pathophysiological evidence supports a
role for EAT in atherogenic processes.
Experimentally, EAT thickness is negatively
correlated with local adiponectin expression
and positively correlated with leptin, resistin
and TNF-a.3 This impairs endothelial func-
tion by affecting endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
synthase-dependent pathways and decreases
endothelial protective effects as a result of a
lower modulatory effect on oxidative stress.3
Moreover, EAT thickness has been associated
with the expression of pro-atherogenic bio-
markers, including NO, soluble intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and bio-
markers of oxidative stress and the endocan-
nabinoid system in patients with coronary
artery disease or subclinical cardiovascular
risk.4­6 Clinically, the relationship between
EAT and endothelial dysfunction and
atherogenesis has been evaluated using assess-
ments such as flow-mediated dilation (FMD)
tests and carotid intima media thickness
(CIMT), which are commonly used as non-
invasive markers of endothelial function.7,8
EAT thickness is an accessible, non-invasive
measurement that can be obtained using
a routine bi-dimensional echocardiographic
scan, and can be identified as the space
between the external layer of the myocardium
and the visceral layer of the pericardium.9
Since studies have indicated a relationship
between EAT thickness and early mediators
of endothelial damage and atherogenesis,
EAT thickness has become a clinically rele-
vant measure to estimate atherogenic risk.1
Specific mechanisms that are linked to
conditions such as obesity are suggested to
influence the relationship between EAT
thickness and coronary artery disease.10,11
Such findings suggest that measuring EAT
thickness with biomarkers of endothelial
damage may be clinically useful for achiev-
ing a more accurate stratification of a
patient's atherogenic risk. Thus, the aim of
the present study was to evaluate whether
endothelial damage mediators participate in
the relationship between EAT thickness and
subclinical atherogenesis in a study popula-
tion that was stratified by conventional
cardiovascular risk factors.

Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective cross-sectional cohort
study included patients >18 years of age
who were evaluated in the Department of
Echocardiography, National Medical Center
`20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE, Mexico City,
Mexico between November 2015 and March
2016 following referral by health-care units
that serve the general population in Mexico
City. Echocardiography was performed as a
follow-up procedure in patients with coron-
ary artery disease or during a routine evalu-
ation in non-ischemic patients who displayed
a variable number of cardiovascular risk
factors, and in whom heart disease was
suspected. Patients undergoing echocardiog-
raphy were sequentially enrolled according to
a Framingham score (FS)12 of ! 20 or < 20,
to obtain balanced groups stratified accord-
ing to a cut-off for significant conventional
cardiovascular risk factors (considered to be
significant if FS !20%).
Patients with pericardial effusion or per-
ipheral artery disease were excluded, as were
patients who had undergone heart surgery,
such as coronary artery bypass grafting or
aortic and mitral valve repair or replace-
ment, due to the possibility that EAT had
been manipulated during the surgical pro-
cedure. Patients with stroke were also
excluded to focus the analyses on conven-
tional cardiovascular risk factors without
undue influence by other factors, such as
cardio embolism.
Smoking history was obtained from
patients during a medical interview, and
nonsmokers were defined as having never
smoked during their lifetime. The number of
pack years was calculated as the number of
cigarettes smoked per day/20, multiplied by
the time (years) smoked.
This study was designed and performed
according to ethical guidelines of the 1975
Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by
the Local Committees of Research, Ethics in
Research and Biosafety of the Centro Me
´ dico
Nacional `20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE, Mexico
City (Protocol ID No. 386.2013). All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
Anthropometry and blood pressure
Body mass index was calculated as weight/
height2 (kg/m2). Waist circumference was
measured half way between the lowest rib
margin and the iliac crest at the end of a
normal expiration. Hip circumference was
measured around the widest portion of the
buttocks with the tape parallel to the floor.
The waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by
dividing waist circumference by hip circum-
ference. Blood pressure was obtained while
the patient was in a seated position and was
considered to be the mean of three readings
taken 5 min apart using a Welch Allyn 767
mobile aneroid sphygmomanometer (Welch
Allyn Inc.; Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA).
Measurement of plasma biomarkers
Following a 12-h fast, venous blood samples
(4 ml) were collected into BD VacutainerÕ
tubes (Becton, Dickinson & Co., Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 1.8mg ethylene-
diaminetetra-acetic acid/ml of blood, centri-
fuged at 1 200 g for 10min at 4C, separated
into fractions and stored at À80 C prior to
analyses. Plasma levels of triglycerides, total
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein chol-
esterol (LDL-C), glycosylated haemoglobin
(HbA1c
) and glucose were determined using
routine clinical laboratory equipment and a
standard auto-analyser (Synchron CXÕ9
PRO Clinical System; Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA, USA).
Plasma markers were analysed in the
Research Laboratory of Experimental
Metabolism and Clinical Research, Centro
Me
´ dico Nacional `20 de Noviembre' ISSSTE,
Mexico City: sICAM-1 levels were determined
using commercially available immunoassay
Peraza-Zaldi
´var et al. 1881
kits (QuantikineÕ enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay: Human ICAM-1/CD54 Allele-
specific Immunoassay; R&D Systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Malondialdehyde
(MDA) levels were determined using a pub-
lished method based on the reaction of MDA
with thiobarbituric acid at 95C,13 and
absorbance of the resultant pink colour was
read at a wavelength of 532nm. Between the
first and second month following sample
collection, NO levels were determined by the
cadmium-mediated reduction of nitrates to
nitrites, and subsequent measurement of nitrite
concentration using a colorimetric Griess
assay.14
Type 2 diabetes mellitus was defined
using guidelines of the American Diabetes
Association15 in patients having one of
the following conditions (repeated for con-
firmation at a separate date [JAP-Z]):
(1) HbA1c
! 6.5%; (2) fasting glucose !
126 mg/dl; or (3) 2-h plasma glucose !
200mg/dl during an oral glucose tolerance
test. Hypertension was defined as blood pres-
sure ! 140/90mmHg. Dyslipidaemia was
defined as one or more of the following con-
ditions: (1) total cholesterol! 200mg/dl; (2)
LDL-C ! 100mg/dl; (3) HDL-C< 40mg/dl,
or (4) triglycerides! 150mg/dl.
Diagnostic imaging
To determine EAT thickness, two-dimensional,
M-mode and Doppler transthoracic echocar-
diography were performed in the left lateral
position using a Philips iE33 cardiac ultra-
sound system (Philips Medical Systems,
Andover, MA, USA) and a Phillips iE33
S5-1 Transducer (Royal Philips, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands). EAT thickness was
defined as the space between the visceral
layer of the pericardium and the outer border
of the myocardium, which registered on the
standard parasternal longitudinal axis and
transverse images. The aortic ring was used
as the anatomical reference for the large axis
parasternal view, and the papillary muscles
were used for the short axis. The images
were acquired in bi-dimensional mode, per-
pendicular to the free wall of the right
ventricle, at the end of systole, over three
cardiac cycles.
In addition, the following echocardio-
graphic parameters were measured using the
guidelines of the American Society of
Echocardiography: left ventricle ejection
fraction was measured using a modified
Simpson method.16 The global longitudinal
strain (fractional change, expressed as a
positive or negative percentage, that reflects
the lengthening or shortening of a myocar-
dial segment, respectively) was measured as
the mean of the left ventricular segments
longitudinal strains.17 Diastolic dysfunction
(the decline in ventricular performance
during diastole, due to abnormal myocar-
dial relaxation and passive left ventricular
pressures) was classified as follows: Grade
I (mild), if mitral E/A ratio < 0.8 (where
E ¼ early diastole wave and A ¼ end-dia-
stole [atrial contraction] wave), deceleration
time > 200 ms, isovolumetric relaxation time
!100 ms, predominant systolic flow is
observed in pulmonary venous inflow (S/
D > 1 [where S ¼ peak systolic flow and
D ¼ peak anterograde diastolic flow]),
e'< 8cm/s (where e'¼ diastolic peak velocity
of the movement of the annulus towards the
left atrium during initial filling of the left
ventricle) and E/e' ratio< 8, either septal or
lateral; Grade II (moderate), if mitral E/A
ratio¼ 0.8­1.5 (pseudonormal) and decreases
by 50% during the Valsalva manoeuver,
e'< 8cm/s and E/e' ratio¼ 9­12 (additional
supporting data include a PV-Ar vel-
ocity> 30cm/s [where PV-Ar¼ end-diastole
pulmonary venous flow] and S/D ratio<1); or
Grade III (severe), if restrictive left ventricular
filling occurs accompanied by an E/A ratio! 2,
deceleration time< 160 ms, isovolumetric
relaxation time 60 ms, systolic filling fraction
40%, mitral A flow duration shorter than
PV-Ar duration and E/e' ratio> 13 (or septal
E/e' ratio! 15 and lateral E/e' ratio> 12).18

An FMD test was used to measure the
diameter of the brachial artery above the
antecubital fossa, which was evaluated
using ultrasound imaging with a Philips
EPIQ7 L12-3 Broadband Linear Array
Transducer (Royal Philips) in B-mode
according to the recommendations of the
International Brachial Artery Reactivity
Task Force.19 The same equipment was
used to measure CIMT.20 Briefly, with the
patient in a supine position, common car-
otid artery scanning was initiated while
focusing on the posterior carotid wall at
the beginning of the carotid bifurcation and
the common carotid artery. At least four
measurements were obtained at a distance of
approximately 10 mm proximal to where the
carotid dilatation was performed because
it represents the greatest distance between
the lumen-intima interface and the media
adventitia interface. In all of the cases,
reproducibility of the measurement was
validated using acceptable intraclass correl-
ation coefficients (agreement) for inter-
observer reliability.
Statistical analyses
The study was designed to evaluate correl-
ations between continuous response vari-
ables (pro-atherogenic biomarkers) and
EAT in patients who were divided into
balanced categorical groups, stratified
according to cardiovascular risk factors
(Framingham score ! 20 and presence of
significant ischemic heart disease versus
Framingham score <20 and no ischemic
heart disease). To calculate the sample size,
previously reported correlations between
biomarkers of interest and EAT thickness
were taken into account, then, observed
significant differences in biomarker values
for similar populations (grouped according
to the presence of coronary artery disease)
were considered. To reject the null hypoth-
esis that the correlation between EAT and
each pro-atherogenic biomarker is less
significant than previously reported findings
or that there is no correlation with a prob-
ability (power) of 0.80 and a type I (a) error
probability of 0.05, the study was deter-
mined to require 40 patients, divided into
balanced groups according to the presence
or absence of significant ischemic heart
disease.
To weight the effects of pro-atherogenic
factors on EAT thickness, cut-off values were
calculated for the following pro-atherogenic
biomarkers using a receiver operating char-
acteristic curve, which best discriminated
CIMT! 1: EAT; NO; sICAM-1 and MDA.
A cut-off value for FMD was set at 4.5% in
accordance with previous reports.21,22 EAT
thickness values were then analysed in
patients stratified according to biomarker
cut-offs. EAT thickness values were similarly
analysed for patients stratified according to
clinical/demographic variables (age, smok-
ing, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
Framingham score).
For descriptive statistics, continuous
variables are presented as median (inter-
quartile range), and categorical variables are
presented as n (%) prevalence. Data distri-
butions for the variables were estimated
using Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. Between-
group comparisons of continuous variables
were performed using unpaired Student's
t-tests or Mann­Whitney U-tests (2-tailed).
Categorical variables were compared
between groups using 2-test or Fisher's
exact test (as appropriate). Pearson's correl-
ation coefficient was applied to determine
the relationship between biomarkers and
EAT values. Any biomarkers found to
have a potential association with EAT and
to be the best predictors of subclinical
atherogenesis (CIMT > 1 mm) were identi-
fied using modelling in the `enter' method
during logistic regression analysis. The rela-
tive risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
are shown. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software, version
23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
Peraza-Zaldi
´var et al. 1883
WindowsÕ, and P values 0.05 (2-tailed)
were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
A total of 40 patients with a mean age of
59 years (range, 33­86 years) were included
in the study (Table 1). Hypertension and
dyslipidaemia, followed by type 2 diabetes
mellitus, were the most frequent cardiovas-
cular risk factors in the study population.
Cardiovascular risk factors may be dif-
ferentially distributed between patients with
and without coronary artery disease, there-
fore, the present study population were
stratified based on the presence of ischemic
heart disease and a Framingham score !20.
The subgroup of patients with a Framingham
score !20 were significantly older, had more
smokers, and a higher prevalence of dyslipi-
daemia and ischemic heart disease, in
addition to more affected heart function
according to echocardiographic parameters
(left ventricular ejection fraction, global lon-
gitudinal strain and absence of diastolic
dysfunction; all P < 0.05; Table 1).
Values for EAT thickness were deter-
mined using echocardiography, and ranged
from 3 to 13 mm for the whole study popu-
lation. The left ventricle ejection fraction
and strain values were within normal ranges
(Table 1; where normal range for systolic left

thickness was significantly higher in patients
with a Framingham score !20 (range, 5.2­
11mm) than in those with a Framingham
score <20 (range, 3­8 mm; P < 0.05).
In terms of biomarkers that reflect sub-
clinical atherogenesis (Table 2), patients
with Framingham scores !20 had signifi-
cantly lower FMD and higher CIMT values
than the group with Framingham scores
<20 (P < 0.05). No statistically significant
between-group differences were observed in
plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunc-
tion or oxidative stress (NO, sICAM-1 or
MDA; Table 2).
The weighted effects of pro-atherogenic
factors on EAT thickness were analysed
using the following biomarker cut-off
values (calculated using a receiver operating
characteristic curve, which best discrimi-
nated CIMT ! 1): EAT, 7.5 mm; NO,
34 mmol/ml; sICAM-1, 100 ng/ml and
MDA, 1 nmol/ml. An FMD cut-off value
of 4.5% was used, as previously stated.
Patient groups were stratified by atherogenic
biomarker (NO, sICAM-1, MDA, FMD,
CIMT) or clinical/demographic variable
(age, smoking, dyslipidaemia, type 2 dia-
betes mellitus, Framingham score), and
EAT thickness was analysed (Figure 1).
Statistically significant between-group dif-
ferences in EAT thickness values were found
in patient groups stratified by NO value,
age, smoking status, dyslipidaemia, type 2
diabetes mellitus and Framingham score
(P < 0.05; Figure 1).
Correlation analyses were also performed
to analyse the relationship between EAT
thickness and NO, sICAM-1, MDA, FMD
and CIMT in the whole patient cohort and
in patients stratified by Framingham score
(Table 3; due to the statistically significant
differences in FMD, CIMT and EAT thick-
ness observed between patients with
Framingham scores ! 20 versus < 20). EAT
thickness was significantly correlated with
MDA (r ¼ À0.54, P < 0.01) in the whole
study cohort, but was not found to be sig-
nificantly correlated with MDA when patients
were stratified according to Framingham
scores (Table 3). CIMT was found to be
significantly correlated with EAT thickness in
the whole study cohort (r ¼ 0.51, P< 0.01)
and in patient groups that were stratified
according to Framingham scores (r ¼ 0.46,

respectively; Table 3). A statistically signifi-
cant inverse correlation was found between
EAT thickness and serum NO levels in the
subgroup of patients with Framingham
scores! 20 (r ¼ À0.56, P¼ 0.04), but not in
the subgroup of patients with scores <20
(r ¼ À0.15, P< 0.31; Table 3).
Further correlation analyses were per-
formed to assess the association between
EAT values and clinical and metabolically-
relevant variables in the whole patient
cohort. Age (r ¼ 0.32, P ¼ 0.02), waist cir-
cumference (r ¼ 0.41, P ¼ 0.01), HDL-C
(r ¼ À0.37, P ¼ 0.01) and Framingham
score (r ¼ 0.46, P < 0.01) were found to be
significantly associated with EAT thickness
(Figure 2).
To determine whether biomarkers of endo-
thelial dysfunction and metabolic damage
affect the relationship between EAT and
subclinical atherogenesis, logistic regression
analyses were performed using the cut-off
values for atherogenic biomarkers that
were found to best discriminate CIMT ! 1,
as described above. Different prediction
models were generated (Table 4), and the
association between EAT thickness and
atherogenic progression (CIMT! 1mm) was
only found to be statistically significant after
type 2 diabetes mellitus and MDA were
included in the model (Model 4; Table 4).
Discussion
Median EAT thickness in the present study
was similar to values described in previous
reports,5,7,8,11 and, as expected, was signifi-
cantly higher in the patient subpopulation
with greater cardiovascular risk (Framingham
score! 20). Members of this population
were also associated with a particular profile
that included older age, smoking, dyslipidae-
mia and ischemic heart disease. The EAT-
associated increase in cardiovascular risk

polated to the general population because the
characteristics and distribution of comorbid-
ities, and the prevalence of risk factors in
the present patient sample are similar to
those reported for the general Mexican popu-
lation according to the 2012 Mexican National
Health and Nutrition Survey and the National
Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes.25,26
A higher level of clinically-detectable athero-
genic risk, detected as significant differences in
FMD and CIMT, was identified in patients
with a Framingham score !20. Interestingly,
this subgroup was likely to already display
advanced-stage vascular damage because bio-
markers including NO, sICAM-1 and MDA,
which are thought to participate in the early
mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction,27,28
were not significantly different from patients
with Framingham score <20.
Nitric oxide, a biomarker of endothelial
dysfunction, seemed to be associated with
EAT thickness in the group of patients with
Framingham score !20, while CIMT was
correlated with EAT thickness globally, and
there were significant differences in EAT
thickness between patients stratified by age,
smoking, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes
mellitus and Framingham score (Figure 1).
Moreover, there was a slightly more signifi-
cant correlation between NO and EAT
thickness than CIMT and EAT thickness
in patients with a Framingham score !20.
Waist circumference and HDL-C were also

found to be correlated with EAT thickness,
and MDA was found to be correlated with
EAT thickness in the whole patient cohort,
but not in patient groups stratified by
Framingham score !20 versus< 20. The pre-
sent observations are in agreement with those
previously reported for a Mexican popula-
tion,11 and together with the particular find-
ings regarding the relationships between EAT
and metabolic variables (dyslipidaemia,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, waist circumference,
HDL-C), NO and CIMT, suggest that EAT
thickness does reflect adiposity and may be
useful to identify patients who display con-
ventional cardiovascular risk factors in the
early stage of vascular damage, when endo-
thelial mechanisms that promote healthy vas-
cular responses might still be functioning.

The role of EAT as an independent
biomarker of endothelial dysfunction and
its potential use in cardiovascular risk strati-
fication has been described in a Turkish
population that was grouped according to
the presence of coronary artery disease.29
Similarly, the clinical relevance of NO has
been demonstrated in other studies that have
associated polymorphisms that affect the
concentration of NO with a prognosis of
mortality resulting from cardiac disease.30,31
The relationship between EAT and NO
observed in the present study appeared to
be associated with a population that also
displayed specific cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. This finding further supports the
notion that EAT may be a biomarker of
endothelial dysfunction and demonstrates
that it may have potential clinical utility for
stratifying patients with cardiovascular risk
factors according to atherogenic risk.
Finally, logistic regression modelling
showed that the interaction between an
EAT ! 6.5 and a CIMT ! 1 becomes statis-
tically significant when type 2 diabetes
mellitus and MDA are included in the
model, suggesting that both variables influ-
ence the ability of EAT thickness to reflect
subclinical atherogenesis.
The results of the present study may be
limited by the low number of patients
included. The sample size calculations, and
prospective balancing of patients with car-
diovascular risks, meant that the sample size
was high enough to evaluate associations
between pro-atherogenic factors and EAT
thickness, however, additional relevant
associations with other variables might
have been missed. Potential selection bias
may have arisen from the exclusion of
patients who underwent surgical heart
manipulation and patients with stroke.
Additionally, the influence of drugs that
can potentially affect adipose tissue metab-
olism was not weighted in the study.
Translational studies investigating bio-
markers of endothelial dysfunction and
their associations with EAT are rare, and
the present findings should, therefore, be
replicated in larger studies. The prognostic
significance of the present findings should be
assessed in longitudinal studies.
In conclusion, NO, a biomarker of endo-
thelial dysfunction, and conventional car-
diovascular risk factors, were associated
with EAT thickness. The specific association
between EAT thickness and NO in the
population that was stratified by
Framingham score, as well as the difference
in EAT thickness between the populations
stratified by NO, but not by CIMT, suggests
that EAT can be used to identify patients
with conventional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors at different stages of vascular damage.
Finally, EAT-associated subclinical athero-
genesis, which was defined as CIMT ! 1,
was further influenced by MDA and type 2
diabetes mellitus.
