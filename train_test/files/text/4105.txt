Introduction
Many professions regularly engage practitioners and aca-
demics in joint research projects, cooperative ventures, and
faculty internships to enhance both the practitioners' prac-
tices as well as the academics' classroom excellence. Case
studies from a variety of disciplines describe, in detail,
lengthy lists of benefits that accrue from such practitioner/
academic interaction. These studies include accounting fac-
ulty internships, which have long been encouraged by the
accounting profession. The research reported on herein
builds upon the existing faculty internship case study
research by conducting a descriptive study to ascertain
whether the benefits described are generalizeable to account-
ing faculty. Investigating the degree to which accounting fac-
ulty internships are used and understanding some of the
perceived benefits/drawbacks are objectives of this research.
Literature Review
The accounting profession continues to yearn for a better
link between itself and academia. This desire has been
expressed on a variety of occasions and is not new. Most
recently, the Pathways Commission on Higher Education, in
its report titled "Charting a National Strategy for the Next
Generation of Accountants," developed detailed objectives
and implementation items aimed at building the strongest
possible professional accounting community, including
focused recommendations for integrating academe and prac-
titioners, with specific reference to faculty internships
(American Accounting Association, American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, & The Pathways Commission
on Accounting Higher Education, 2012). The Pathways
Commission study was underwritten by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the American
Accounting Association, and included constituents drawn
from every facet of the accounting profession. In an earlier
seminal piece, Accounting Education: Charting the Course
Through a Perilous Future, Albrecht and Sack (2000)
emphasized the need for academic institutions to make a
commitment to invest in faculty development sufficient to
ensure that faculty stay engaged with the fast-paced chang-
ing world of business, including consulting, internship, resi-
dency, or other real-world experiences. Albrecht and Sack's
work was the culmination of a project jointly sponsored by
theAmericanAccountingAssociation, theAmerican Institute

Accounting Faculty Internships: A
Descriptive Study

Abstract
Accounting professionals, business college accrediting bodies, and even accounting academics themselves acknowledge that
there is a disconnect between academe and the rigors and requirements of the accounting profession. Among the suggestions
proposed in the literature to reduce this gap is the faculty internship, where accounting faculty members work within the field
as accountants. Heretofore, individual case studies report benefits of such internships that accrue to a variety of stakeholder
groups beyond just the faculty intern and include the academic institution, students, and accounting profession through
faculty internships. This research seeks wider support for these benefits. This descriptive study involved surveying a sample
of accounting faculty members to get their opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of faculty internships, and to determine
the level of use of faculty internships in accounting. In all, 128 usable responses were obtained, representing a 14.6% response
rate. The results of this study reveal that although most faculty members acknowledge the benefits cited in the literature, too
few take advantage of faculty internships.

of Certified Public Accountants, the Institute of Management
Accountants, and all of the "Big" accounting firms at the
time, which included Arthur Andersen, Deloitte & Touche,
Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. As
such, all of the major professional accounting associations
and practitioners endorsed the work of Albrecht and Sack.
In 2008, Cynthia Fornelli, executive director of the Center
for Audit Quality, testified before the Advisory Committee
on the Auditing Profession of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury that quality audits require well-trained auditors. As
one way to promote the development of well-trained human
capital, Fornelli proposed that
educational institutions, auditing firms, corporations, federal and
state regulators, and others engage in a two-fold strategy to both
encourage cross-sabbaticals and eliminate financial or career
disincentives for participating in such experiences. Further, the
Committee recommends that university administrators place as
high a value on professional sabbaticals for purposes of
promotion and tenure for research and scholarly publication.
(Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession, 2008, p. V:13)
The information presented by these constituencies indi-
cates that faculty internships have the strong support of
accounting practitioners.
The premier accrediting body for business schools,
AACSB International--The Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business--essentially mandates
accounting faculty engagement in internships or similar
experiences in its Eligibility Procedures and Accreditation
Standards for Accounting Accreditation for schools that
wish to have their accounting programs accredited.
Specifically, Standard 36 requires that the accounting fac-
ulty as a whole must maintain a portfolio of "relevant practi-
cal experience" in business and accounting, and includes in
its definition of relevant practical experience internships
and work in a variety of business, government, and not-for-
profit organizations (AACSB, 2009).
Clearly, the accounting profession and the AACSB recog-
nize the importance and value of faculty internships to the
enhancement of accounting education. In addition, extant
case studies report that faculty who have had an internship
experience feel that it enhanced their classroom performance
and provided benefits to their institution and to the internship
sponsors (e.g., Bermudez, 2005; Brands, 1998; Carnes &
Gierlasinski, 1999; Cheng, 2001; Gibson, 2001; Hendricks,
1993; Herron & Morozzo, 2008; Kulesza, 1994; Lantos,
1994; Merryman, 2001). The benefits reported by these
authors all fall within the same general categories--benefits
to faculty development, teaching quality, other areas of fac-
ulty life, the sponsoring firm, and students. Several studies
also describe a limited number of drawbacks that may result
from a faculty internship.
There is strong support for the value of faculty internships
from a variety of stakeholder groups. What is lacking is
information regarding the benefits of internships that spans a
broader scope than solely in individual situations and occur-
rences, and information on the rate of use of this means to
bridge the practitioner­academic gap. Whereas case studies
place emphasis on the full contextual analysis of a limited
number of events, a broader study of the issue is needed to
ferret out whether the benefits reported by the individuals
described in the case studies can be generalized to the larger
population of accounting faculty as a whole. This article
describes the results of a survey conducted to fill this need.
This study should be useful and informative to accounting
faculty, to the institutions who employ accounting faculty,
and to potential internship sponsors.
Method
We conducted a descriptive study to collect data about the
incidence of accounting faculty internships. A descriptive
study does not execute causal hypothesis testing; instead, the
objective of a descriptive study is to provide valuable infor-
mation about the who, what, when, where, and how of a topic
to generate hypotheses or identify areas for future research.
The emphasis of a descriptive study is generally on the esti-
mation, rather than the testing, of the prevalence, history, or
attitudes and perceptions about a topic. In this study, we
describe (a) the prevalence of faculty internships, (b) the
characteristics of the schools where faculty interns teach, (c)
the experience of faculty interns, and (d) the benefits and
drawbacks of faculty internships, as perceived by those with
actual faculty intern experience compared with those who
have not experienced an internship.
Sample
We drew our sample from the population of U.S. account-
ing faculty as described in Prentice Hall 2008-2009
Accounting Faculty Directory (Hasselback, 2008). This is
an annual compilation of faculty members from more than
1,000 schools, including every accounting program in the
United States as well as many other countries. This direc-
tory provides information about each faculty member's
rank, area of expertise, highest degree earned and from
where, length of tenure and contact information (including
email address). We randomly sampled 10% of the faculty
members of various rank, time in service, and area of exper-
tise from each of the nearly 1,000 U.S. accounting pro-
grams reported in the directory, in an attempt to obtain a
representative sample of U.S. accounting program faculty
members. This yielded a sample of 875 faculty members to
survey. However, it should be noted that those faculty
members with a more professional- or practice-oriented
agenda might be more inclined to respond to our survey
than those with a more research-oriented agenda, due to the
subject nature of the survey.

Survey
Demographic questions included faculty member's school
size and accreditation status, and the faculty member's length
of tenure, professional certification, degrees held, profes-
sional experience, type of internship(s), and internship tasks.
The remainder of the survey was devoted to collecting infor-
mation about faculty opinions concerning the various bene-
fits and drawbacks of faculty internships mentioned in the
literature. In designing our survey, these benefits and draw-
backs were discussed among faculty members who had had
internships, with general consensus that those included in the
survey were representative of what the faculty members had
experienced in their internships. Our survey was then pre-
tested on several faculty members, including half who had
completed internships and half who had not. Half of these
faculty were tenured, half were not tenured, and their years
of teaching experience ranged from 2 to more than 40. All
had prior professional accounting work experience, from 5
years to more than 20. We tried to pretest a broad range of
faculty experience to match as closely as possible the sample
to which we would send the survey. The survey is included as
Appendix A.
Benefit and drawback questions were extracted from
numerous published case studies (American Accounting
Association, American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, & The Pathways Commission on Accounting
Higher Education, 2012; Beck, 2001; Bermudez, 2005;
Brands, 1998; Carnes & Gierlasinski, 1999; Cheng, 2001;
Gibson, 2001; Hales, Wiener, & Lynn, 2007; Hendricks,
1993; Herron & Morozzo, 2008; Kulesza, 1994; Lantos,
1994; Morra, Flohr, & Eckrich, 2003; Smith, 1995).
Appendix B lists each question and the source(s) of the ques-
tions. Based on categories derived from the literature, we
assigned each benefit into one of the following five catego-
ries: faculty development (12 items), teaching quality (8
items), other areas of faculty life (7 items), sponsoring firm
(11 items), and direct benefits to students (5 items). Seven
potential drawbacks to completing a faculty internship cited
in the literature were also included.
As we were interested in knowing respondents' assess-
ments and the strength of these assessments, we constructed
each benefit/drawback item question using a Likert-type
scale format, where respondents indicated how closely their
feelings agreed with each benefit/drawback on a rating scale
ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). For
ease of interpretation in the final analysis, these scales were
"reverse scored" so that higher scores indicate strong agree-
ment (i.e., 5 = strongly agree and 1 = strongly disagree).
Survey Administration
The survey was distributed via email and administered using
a link to the online survey software, Qualtrics. Qualtrics is a
leading online survey software used by more than 90 of the
nation's top business schools, as well as by Fortune 500
companies (Qualtrics, 2010).
After 3 days, we had approximately 75 usable responses,
and 8 undelivered (5 invalid email addresses and 3 retired
faculty). A reminder email was sent after a week. Within
another week after sending the reminder email, we had
received 128 usable responses. According to Sheehan and
McMillan (1999), the response rate for email surveys tends
to be somewhat lower than those of traditional postal mail
surveys. Surveys sent by educational/nonprofit organizations
have an average open rate of 17.5% and an average click-
through rate of 1.7% (Epsilon, 2009). With nearly a 15%
click-through response rate, we closed the survey.
Results
Institution Demographics
Summary.Schools of a variety of sizes are represented.
Respondents were fairly evenly distributed among the five
university size categories specified, as well as for the five
size categories specified for the number of accounting
majors. Most of the schools have relatively small class sizes
(more than 90% of respondents reported smaller class sizes
of up to 50 students), and a relatively small number of
accounting faculty members (90% having from 1 to 20
accounting faculty).
Most respondents worked for institutions that had some
kind of business accreditation (79%), with 64% having gen-
eral business AACSB accreditation. No significant differ-
ences were observed when internship benefit and drawback
responses were compared by institutional size and by
AACSB accreditation versus no AACSB accreditation. The
majority of the schools represented (77%) are open to faculty
internships that could be done either during the school year
and/or in the summer.
Institution Size
Almost 25% of respondents' university size was in the range
of 10,001 to 20,000 students, followed by approximately
22% from schools with 2,501 students to 5,000 students,
approximately 19% from schools with more than 20,000 stu-
dents and with 2,500 or fewer students, and 15% from
schools with 5,001 to 10,000 students (Figure 1).
Twenty-five percent of respondents indicated that their
accounting programs had from 101 to 200 accounting majors,
followed by approximately 22% with more than 300 stu-
dents, almost 19% with 51 to 100 and fewer than 50 students,
and 15% with 201 to 300 students (Figure 2).
Business accreditation.We provided respondents with four
accreditation choices: AACSB (business), ACBSP (Associa-
tion of Collegiate Business School Programs), Other, or
None. Sixty-four percent of respondents teach in
4 SAGE Open

Christopher et al. 5
AACSB-accredited schools, with 45% of those schools also
having AACSB accounting accreditation. Eleven percent are
accredited by ACBSP. Of those who reported "Other," one
respondent's school is in AACSB candidacy status and one is
considering AACSB, two are accredited by IACBE (Interna-
tional Assembly for Collegiate Business Education), and
three reported regional general accreditation only. Overall,
79% of respondents work for schools either having or consid-
ering some sort of business accreditation--AACSB, ACBSP,
or IACBE (Figure 3).
Institutional openness to faculty internships.With respect to
institutional openness to faculty internships, 88% were open
to faculty internships, either in the summer only or in the
summer as well as during the academic year. Surprisingly,
the majority (77%) of schools open to faculty internships
were also open to having faculty internships take place dur-
ing the academic year.
Faculty Respondent Demographics
Summary of faculty respondent demographics.Most faculty
respondents are full-time, senior-ranking teachers holding a
doctoral degree and at least one professional certification
(most often a certified public accountant [CPA]). They have
taught accounting for at least 20 years. It has been 10 to 20
years since they practiced accounting, which the majority did
for 10 years at most. Despite the willingness on the part of
their employer institutions to allow them to complete a
faculty internship, the desire on the part of the accounting
profession and academia's premier business school accredi-
tation body for faculty internships to take place, and the mul-
titude of benefits that accrue from faculty internships, only a
handful of these faculty members have ever completed a fac-
ulty internship.
Title/rank, highest degree earned, and professional certification(s)
held.Most faculty respondents (92%) hold a senior-level
rank (full or associate professor), with the majority (75%) of
these senior-ranking faculty holding the title of full profes-
sor. Approximately 6% hold the title of assistant professor,
and approximately 2% hold some other title. No respondents
reported holding the title of instructor.
Most faculty respondents (almost 83%) have earned a
doctoral degree. Almost 17% hold a master's-level degree;
less than 1% hold a baccalaureate degree only.
Almost all (95%) of all responding faculty members are
CPAs. Many hold multiple certifications, including CMA
(certified management accountant), CFE (certified fraud
examiner), ABV/CVA (accredited business valuator/certified
valuation analyst), CIA (certified internal auditor), and oth-
ers, causing the sum of the results to exceed 100%.
Full- or part-time position, teaching experience, and profes-
sional experience.Almost all (98%) of responding faculty
are full-time teachers. The majority (75%) of responding
faculty have been teaching accounting for more than 20
years, with two thirds of that majority having taught for
Figure 3.Accreditation.
6 SAGE Open
more than 25 years. Of the remaining 25%, 52% have been
teaching from 16 to 20 years, 28% from 11 to 15 years,
16% from 6 to 10 years, and 4% from 0 to 5 years.
Of those who have worked in the accounting profession,
most (81%) of the responding faculty have spent 10 or fewer
years in professional practice, with the majority (70%) of
those respondents having 5 or fewer years of professional
accounting experience. Of the remaining 19%, almost half
(47%) have 21 or more years of professional accounting
experience, followed by 37% with 11 to 15 years of experi-
ence, and 16% with 16 to 20 years of experience.
Approximately 13% of our respondents have never
worked in the accounting profession, but for the 87% that
have, the time that has passed since they left their profes-
sional practice in accounting varies widely. For 37%, it has
been more than 20 years since they left the accounting pro-
fession. The largest group--43%--left the profession from 6
to 20 years ago. Nine percent left from 0 to 5 years ago, and
11% continue to work in the profession.
Has an internship been completed,and reasons for not completing
an internship. The investigation of the degree to which fac-
ulty internships are used in the accounting profession is one
of the primary purposes of this research project. As revealed
in the literature review, both the profession and the AACSB
are strong proponents of faculty­practitioner engagement
through internships. Accordingly, the responses to this ques-
tion can either cause us to give accounting programs a
congratulatory pat on the back or a wake-up call to action.
Unfortunately, in spite of the strong support for accounting
faculty internships in the profession and by AACSB, only
19% of our faculty respondents have ever completed a fac-
ulty internship.
Figure 4 shows the variety of reasons that surfaced for the
81% of our faculty respondents who have not completed a
faculty internship. The most frequently stated reason is that
there is no professional benefit to completing one (29%), fol-
lowed by the employer institution prefers faculty to do
research (21%). Eighteen respondents (15%) indicated that
they could not get sabbatical time to do an internship, and
11% responded that they could not find a sponsoring firm.
Within the "other" category, the most-often-given
response was "have never pursued one," followed by "no
time" and "no opportunity." Additional responses included
variations on "logistics" (desired internship was too far
away), "no encouragement," "not an option," "not aware of
an available program," and--most perplexing of all--"Why
do one?" It seems clear from the nature of these responses
that although faculty members may agree that there are ben-
efits to completing a faculty internship, they are not con-
vinced that these benefits outweigh the perceived costs.
To better understand who might be more likely to have com-
pleted an internship, a comparison of the demographic charac-
teristics of the respondents and their schools was conducted but
revealed no significant differences between those respondents
who completed internships and those who did not.

Internship Characteristics
Summary of internship characteristics.Accounting faculty
internships were primarily sponsored by CPA firms of
various sizes with only 14% by industry. Most of these
organizations (66%) did not have a formal faculty intern-
ship program in place when approached by the faculty
member about sponsoring an internship. The kinds of work
performed were rich with variety, but clustered around
exploiting the faculty intern's teaching area or strength,
followed by working on special projects, problems, and/or
teams (Figure 5). These emphases were most likely to take
advantage of specialized skills possessed by the faculty
intern, or to have the faculty intern work on projects that
the sponsoring organization lacked the time to complete
otherwise.
When internship was completed.Most (54%) of the faculty
internships were full-time internships completed during the
academic year, followed by summer internships (42%). Only
4% of internships were part-time internships completed dur-
ing the academic year.
How internship site was selected. Several factors were consid-
ered by faculty respondents in choosing their internship sites.
Respondents were allowed to choose multiple factors. Most
important was the receptiveness of the internship sponsor
(31%), followed by the kind of work that the faculty member
would be able to complete (24%). The internship location
(22%) and availability of an internship at the desired time
(20%) were roughly equal in importance. Other consider-
ations accounted for approximately 7%.
The majority (69%) of accounting faculty internships
were sponsored by CPA firms, with 60% of those firms being
"Big" (8, 6, 5, or 4, depending on when the faculty member
had the internship) international firms, 30% being national or
regional firms, and 10% being local firms. Industry provided
14% of accounting faculty internships, followed by not-for-
profit institutions (10%) and governmental entities (7%).
Two thirds of these organizations did not have a formal fac-
ulty internship program in place when they sponsored the
respondents' internships.
Perceived Benefits/Drawbacks Accruing From
Faculty Internships
The analysis of faculty internship benefits and drawbacks are
shown in this section at two levels. The first level shows the
"overall" benefits/drawbacks perceived by the total respon-
dent base. Each chart in this section is organized from top to
bottom, with the highest "overall" agreement at the top and
the lowest "overall" agreement on the bottom of each chart.
This overall order shows the relative importance of each
benefit/drawback as perceived by the total sample.
It is also of interest to analyze the differences between
faculty who have actually completed an internship versus
Figure 5. What kind of work did you do in your internship.
8 SAGE Open
those who have not. Thus, the second level of analysis shown
on each chart indicates the split between those respondents
who have had a faculty internship and those who have not.
The actual significance level is shown only where the differ-
ences are significant at the 90% confidence level. All others
are not significant at the 90% level. These results support the
assertion that faculty members acknowledge and generally
agree on the benefits and drawbacks of internships.
Faculty development benefits. "Faculty development" refers to
professional development, in the academic sense. Profes-
sional development includes all types of facilitated learning
opportunities, comprising formal coursework, conferences,
and informal learning opportunities situated in practice and
mentoring. It is often intensive and collaborative. As such,
for faculty members, faculty development goes beyond sim-
ply making one a more effective teacher because most fac-
ulty members' job descriptions include not only teaching but
also intellectual contributions/research and service.
The items that we categorized as faculty development
benefits seek to capture multiple facets of a faculty mem-
ber's job description, and are listed in Figure 6, which also
shows differences in perception between those faculty who
have actually experienced an internship and those who have
not.
As can be seen, these results indicate that for most of the
listed items, our respondents either agree or strongly agree
that faculty internships provide the described faculty devel-
opment benefits. It is interesting to note that the top benefits
perceived center on gaining "real-world" and relevant, prac-
tical experience that can then be brought back to the class-
room. While not all are significant, these attributes were seen
to be directionally more important to those who have com-
pleted an internship versus those who have not. In fact, the
only significant difference in faculty development benefits
was the most important one: "engage in relevant practical
accounting experience."
Improvement in teaching quality.This category of benefits
hones in directly on improvements in a faculty member's
ability to deliver quality instruction in the classroom. The
results of our survey indicate that for most of the listed items,
our respondents either agree or strongly agree that faculty
internships provide the indicated improvements in teaching
quality. Figure 7 highlights that there is the greatest disagree-
ment on the part of faculty respondents about the benefits
that imply that a teacher might engage in a faculty internship
merely for personal or self-serving reasons such as making
the teacher more popular with students, improving the teach-
er's course evaluations, or enhancing students' perception
about the teacher's teaching quality. While there are no sig-
nificant differences between respondents who have had a
faculty internship and those who have not, those who have
had an internship consistently rate the benefits to
Figure 6. Benefits of faculty internship to faculty development.
Christopher et al. 9
be directionally higher. Overall, there is a generally strong
consensus about the other benefits to teaching quality that
accrue from a faculty internship.
Again, as with faculty development benefits, measures
related to keeping up to date are the most important. The two
benefits receiving the highest agreement were "gain up-to-
date experiences to take back to the classroom" and "teach
beyond the textbook." Benefits such as "enhance students'
perception that I am a better teacher," "increase the popular-
ity and attractiveness of my courses to students," and
"improve my course evaluations" received very low benefit
scores. It is comforting to note that neither respondent group
perceives pleasing or appealing to students to be a strong
benefit of an internship.
Benefits to other areas of faculty life.These benefits to the
faculty intern do not fit neatly into any other category, but
nevertheless represent improvements in the faculty intern's
environment. Examples include new career opportunities,
enhanced respect, renewed enthusiasm, and a variety of
benefits, which accrue to the faculty intern's school and
colleagues. Though agreement about the items in this cate-
gory is not as strong as it is for the other faculty benefit
categories, Figure 8 shows some agreement that faculty
internships provide additional personal and individual
benefits.
While there are no significant differences among the ben-
efits shown here, there are some interesting observations to
be made. First of all, it is notable that respondents with no
internship experience directionally perceive more benefit in
"fostering closer relationships" and "encouraging internship
opportunities for other faculty members" than do those who
have actually had an internship. The only "significant" dif-
ference is that those who have had an internship more
strongly agree with the statement "gain enhanced respect
from students, colleagues, and practitioners" than those who
have not had an internship.
Benefits to the sponsoring firm.Many of these benefits
accrue to the sponsoring firm as a result of bringing in
"fresh blood" and getting closer to potential future employ-
ees: "faculty contact for future help with projects," "helps
future student employees better understand the firm/
accounting profession," and "increases firm's visibility to
students." In addition, they see benefits in getting closer to
academia and in finding new ways to look at problems or
issues: "knowledgeable, hardworking, independent staff
member"; "independent observer"; and "recruiter for
future accounting employees." The sponsoring firm gets a
viewpoint from the outside, and the accounting faculty
intern gets a look inside. There is general agreement about
these benefits, with a somewhat lower degree of agreement
on the idea that sponsoring firms will realize an expanded
pool of quality accounting graduates from which to recruit.
Figure 9 shows a summary of the indicated benefits to
internship sponsors.
Figure 7. Benefits of faculty internship to teaching quality.
10 SAGE Open
Figure 8. Benefits to other areas of faculty life.
Figure 9. Benefits to the sponsoring firm.
Christopher et al. 11
While there is overall agreement that faculty internships
are highly beneficial to sponsoring firms, there are more sig-
nificant differences in this benefit category between those with
internship experience and those without than in any other cat-
egory. Those with internship experience agree more with the
statement "provides hardworking staff member who can work
independently with little supervision." Respondents with no
internship experience more strongly perceive that internships
"helpthefirmandprofessiontoinfluenceacademia";"enhance
development of firm's accounting staff resulting from faculty
intern's questions, observations, and recommendations" and
"expand quality and quantity of talent pool available to the
profession." These results suggest that those with internship
experience see the firm's benefits to be more internally focused
compared with those without an internship.
Percentage responses for "neither agree nor disagree"
ranged from 45% for "higher quality accounting students to
recruit" to 17% for "faculty contact for future help with proj-
ects." No "disagree" or "strongly disagree" percentage
exceeded 11% ("expands quality, quantity of talent pool
available to the profession"), with all others ranging from
7% to 1%.
Direct benefits to students. Though improvements in faculty
interns' teaching quality benefits students indirectly, this
set of items provides direct benefits to students in the form
of vicarious exposure to the sponsoring firm, increased stu-
dent internship opportunities, better career advising and
counsel, enhanced interest in the accounting profession,
and a more practical education in general. As with other
benefit categories, there is general agreement among fac-
ulty respondents with respect to these benefits to students.
Figure 10 shows a summary of perceived faculty internship
benefits to students.
Responses in the "neither agree nor disagree" category
were the next largest for all student benefits, ranging from
34% for "enhanced interest and motivation to join the profes-
sion" to 12% for "better career advising and counsel in career
opportunities." Percentages for the "disagree" and "strongly
disagree" categories ranged from 1% to 7%.
Summary of faculty internship benefits. With very few excep-
tions, faculty respondents are, on average, in general agree-
ment that faculty internships provide a wide range of worthy
benefits to a variety of stakeholder groups. It is hard to envi-
sion another activity that provides a better way to achieve
such a wide array of benefits.
Faculty Internship Drawbacks
Very few drawbacks are mentioned in the literature relative
to faculty internships. Those mentioned relate generally to
Figure 10. Benefits of faculty internship to students.
12 SAGE Open
the faculty intern personally, rather than to other stake-
holder groups. These drawbacks include feeling as though
the faculty intern is imposing upon the internship sponsor,
that the faculty intern's performance evaluations will not
adequately acknowledge the value of the faculty internship,
that learning from former students will be awkward, that
the faculty intern's workday freedoms will be imposed
upon, and that the faculty intern will have to travel more.
Faculty respondents are in general agreement that these
drawbacks do exist with only one exception--a feeling of
awkwardness arising from having former students as teach-
ers. However, when we considered the responses to our
question as to why respondents had not pursued a faculty
internship, the absence of mention of any of the drawbacks
included in this set of items leads us to believe that even
though these drawbacks exist, they would be considered
very minor, and not so offensive as to preclude a faculty
member from pursuing an internship. Figure 11 shows a
comparison of perceived drawbacks of a faculty internship
between those who had an internship to those who did not
have an internship.
In support of our assertion that these drawbacks are con-
sidered to be rather minor, our respondents' level of agree-
ment is lower, in general, than with their level of agreement
with the various categories of benefits. In addition, the level
of disagreement with the drawbacks is higher than with any
of the benefit categories. The most important overall per-
ceived drawbacks are related to time and work schedule fac-
tors. However, these issues seem to be more perception than
reality. Respondents with no internship experience were sig-
nificantly more concerned with these issues than those who
have had an internship.
To summarize, though our respondents acknowledged
that the list of drawbacks does exist, our survey results imply
that these drawbacks, even when taken as a whole, would not
necessarily preclude a faculty member from pursuing an
internship, if that were the faculty member's desire.
Conclusion
We performed a descriptive statistical analysis, and tabu-
lated the combined results of all of our demographic and
perceived benefits/drawbacks data collected on accounting
faculty internships based on the observations made in a vari-
ety of case studies both within and outside of the accounting
profession. This study suggests that all accounting faculty
members acknowledge and generally agree on the benefits
and drawbacks of internships. Results indicate that, regard-
less of institutional size, existence of business accreditation,
or individual faculty characteristics, there is a general con-
sensus that faculty internships are of significant value to a
variety of stakeholders, and that there are negligible

drawbacks associated with faculty internships. These are
consistent with and provide additional support for prior case
studies, and suggest that benefits can be gained from engag-
ing in an appropriate faculty internship, regardless of the
faculty member's individual situation. Faculty internships
provide a variety of opportunities to enhance existing skills,
develop new skills, apply skills to new problems, expand
research avenues, and enhance the operations of sponsoring
firms. With all of the perceived and acknowledged potential
for accounting faculty internships to add value in so many
ways, it is alarming to discover that so few of these intern-
ships have actually taken place. The results of this study
should serve as a wake-up call to the accounting academy
that a simple and effective means to bridge the perceived
gap between accounting practitioners and academics is
being grossly underutilized.
Recommendations for Future Research
One of the prime benefits of this study is to reveal areas of
future research that would result in greater use of faculty
internships to the benefit of all stakeholder groups and bridge
the practitioner­academic gap. Some possibilities for future
research include further investigation into the reasons why
schools do not promote and facilitate accounting faculty
internships more aggressively, the reasons why accounting
faculty members are not more enthusiastic about initiating
and pursuing faculty internships, and methods for encourag-
ing greater use of faculty internships to enhance the value of
accounting education and this critical link to the accounting
profession. The same questions may be directed toward the
accounting profession to consider utilizing and inviting aca-
demics to collaborate within their organizations. In the same
way that internship opportunities for students are established,
are there--or shouldn't there be--similar opportunities for
professors?
Additional research could be conducted to better under-
stand the types of schools that place a higher value on intern-
ships. Are these the schools that are mission-designated as
"teaching" schools, rather than "research" schools? Are they
schools with firmly established recruiting relationships with
public accounting firms or other types of business?
Another avenue of research could investigate the nature
of satisfaction that is derived from a faculty internship. Is it
that the intern gets to complete certain tasks that are attrac-
tive, such as engaging in current problem-solving, training
firm employees in new theoretical methods, becoming
skilled at implementing state-of-the-art methods; is it that a
break in the routine of academia to join the "real world" is a
welcome change; or is it that the intern gets to become the
student? In other words, which benefits are of the most value
and provide the most satisfaction to interns?
Compensation of interns and the options utilized could
also be explored. What types of compensation are received by
faculty interns? Do all faculty interns receive compensation?
How does the compensation received by interns compare
with that received from a typical consulting engagement? Are
would-be faculty interns engaging in consulting as opposed to
internships?
Faculty internships and additional faculty­practitioner
relationships in other disciplines should be investigated to
learn how these other disciplines facilitate the process of
creating, implementing, and exploiting faculty internships.
Identifying ways to make the viability and attractiveness of
faculty internships more visible to stakeholder groups is
critical if this valuable tool is to be used as it should be to
assist in reconnecting academia and the accounting
profession.
