Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may cause
perturbations in endogenous hormonal regulation that predispose to weight gain. Using data
from NHANES (1999­2002), we investigated the association between body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference (WC) and selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) via
multiple linear regressions. Consistent interaction was found between gender, ln
oxychlordane and ln p,p' DDT. Also, we found an association between WC and ln

oxychlordane and ln hpcdd in subjects with detectable levels of POPs, whereas an
association between WC and ln p,p' DDT was observed in all subjects. Furthermore, ln
Ocdd showed an increase with higher WC and BMI, whereas, ln trans-nonachlor decreased
with higher BMI. Hence, BMI and WC are associated with POPs levels, making the
chemicals plausible contributors to the obesity epidemic.

pollutants; public health
1. Introduction
The prevalence of obesity has risen substantially in both adults and children, and is recognized as a
serious public health problem [1]. Beyond body mass index (BMI) Kg/m2, which is the most
commonly used proxy index of obesity, indicators of regional fat distribution such as waist circumference
(WC) have been linked to cardiovascular disease [2-6], insulin resistance syndrome [7-10], and increased
risks of breast, colorectal, and renal cancer [11-13]. A recent study showed small but consistent
increases in WC in the U.S. population over calendar time from the 1960s to the present even when
measured at any fixed BMI level [14].
While much has been written about the reasons behind the global obesity epidemic, industrial
toxicants found in the environment, the food system, and humans have just begun to receive significant
attention. Recent evidence suggests that environmental contaminants known or presumed to disrupt
endocrine systems, appropriately termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may play a role in the
growing problem of obesity [15,16]. These contaminants are mostly persistent in the environment and
are known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). It is plausible that POPs lead to preferential
increases in abdominal fat because it is known that the hormonal milieu has profound effects on the
anatomic distribution of fat. However, whether associations between lifetime exposure to low doses of
a mixture of various POPs and measures of adiposity exist in the general population is not known.
Given that almost all persons are exposed to POPs, the public health importance of a relation of these
chemicals with weight gain may be substantial, despite a relatively modest association with any
individual POPs.
Recently, a dose-response relation was observed between serum concentrations of POPs and
metabolic syndrome [17], insulin resistance [18], and diabetes [19]. Surprisingly, in people with
undetectable levels of POPs, the typically robust association between obesity and diabetes was not
observed [19]. However, an unanswered question is whether POPs might directly contribute to obesity
in the population. Lee and colleagues have offered some useful evidence, but their study only treated
BMI and WC as covariates, not as outcomes to be modeled. Hence, to explore this possibility of POPs'
associations with adiposity indicators, we investigated the associations among BMI, WC and selected
POPs,-which do not have high affinities for the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr)-, in 1999­2002 data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 99-02). Some of the examined
POPs are dioxins, which are a family of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds known chemically as
dibenzo-p-dioxins. Dioxins are highly toxic and persist in the environment for extended periods. They
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2990
are produced during incineration of wastes and are produced as contaminants in chemical
manufacturing processes [20]. We examined the measured POPs in that dataset which are
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (hpcdd), 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (Ocdd),
oxychlordane, trans-nonchlor, and p,p'-DDT. The POPs that have higher affinities for the Ahr in the
NHANES dataset, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), did not show significant
associations with either BMI or WC.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Sample
We used data from the publicly available nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of the
U.S. non-institutionalized civilian population conducted by the US National Center for Health and
Statistics (NCHS), (NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002). These surveys have the same basic structure
and plan, and they both contain data on age, gender, race, height, weight, and WC.
2.2. Measures
Anthropometric measures including height, weight, and WC were obtained via standardized
protocols as described elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/bmxdoc.pdf).
Measures of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dobenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-ortho
substituted or coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (cPCBs), other polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
persistent chlorinated metabolites were assessed in participants on a one-third serum samples. For this
analysis, data from the two surveys (1999­2000 and 2001­2002) were aggregated. The NHANES
standardized home interview was followed by a detailed physical examination in a mobile evaluation
clinic or the participant's home. PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs, and organochlorine pesticides were all
measured in serum samples as individual chemicals by high resolution gas chromatography mass
spectrometry (GC­MS) using isotope dilution for quantification. The POPs were provided by
NHANES and adjusted for serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. All POPs levels were transformed
by taking the natural log (ln) of each in order to improve linearity and analyzed in their
transformed form.
We selected five POPs (present in 80% of the NHANES population): 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (hpcdd); 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (Ocdd); oxychlordane; trans-nonchlor, and
p,p'-DDT. Based on the above criteria, a total of 2,464 participants with valid BMI scores and 2,448
participants with valid WC score were examined.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis used three regression models to test all available participants for associations
with overall adiposity as assessed by BMI and WC. Two models regressed BMI and WC on gender,
ethnicity, age, age squared, and POPs. The third model regressed WC on the previous predictors while
controlling for BMI. We will refer to these models as additive models. Each of these models was
extended by including two-way interactions between gender and the POPs. Secondary/sensitivity
analyses employed all of the same models as the primary analyses but evaluated only participants with
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2991
detectable levels of POPs. All parameter interpretations will be done on using standard deviation units
based on standardized regression parameters; ( )

All analyses, including descriptive statistics, were conducted using SAS-Callable SUDDAN 9.0.1,
which estimates standard errors using the sampling weights, strata, and primary sampling units (PSU)
from NHANES taking into account for the complex sampling procedures used. For details on the
sampling procedures used, visit the NHANES website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.

3.2. Primary Analysis
3.2.1. Additive Models
Results of the additive regression models for all participants are presented in Table 2. In the additive
BMI model there are significant main associations for ethnicity (p = 0.0466),
age (p < 0.00005), age squared (p < 0.00005), ln Ocdd (p = 0.0099), and ln DDT (p = 0.0353), with the
overall model accounting for 8% of the BMI variance. Natural log (ln) values for the POPs were used,
as is typical in this type of study [19]. Expressed in standard deviation (SD) units, each 1 SD increase
in ln Ocdd, BMI is associated with an increase of 0.249 BMI units and every SD unit increase in
ln DDT is associated with a BMI increase of 0.106 units (i.e., the Beta value for ln DDT = 0.48;
Table 2). The joint test p-value for the additive BMI model, which is the simultaneous test of
all 5 POPs, is 0.0001. Additionally, the POPs accounted for 2% of the BMI variance.

Note. WC stands for waist circumference. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. Joint Test refers
to the simultaneous test of all POPs.
For the additive WC model, there are significant associations for gender (p < 0.00005),
age (p < 0.00005), age squared (p < 0.00005), and ln Ocdd (p = 0.0052). The model accounted for 16%
of the variance in WC. WC increases by 1.76 centimeters with each SD unit increase in ln Ocdd. The
joint test p-value for the additive WC model is 0.0008.
For testing the additive WC model controlling for BMI, there was a significant association for
gender (p < 0.00005) and ln hpcdd (p = 0.0091) with the model accounting for 88% of the WC
variance (Table 2). In this model, males tended to have 6.40 centimeters higher WC than females.
However, WC decreased by 0.163 centimeters for every SD unit increase in ln hpcdd. This is an
exception to the general observation that WC increases

with POPs exposure. The joint test p-value for
testing the POPs simultaneously for the additive WC model controlling for BMI is 0.0798, which is
nearly statistically significant.
Table 3 displays the results of the interaction regression models for all participants, and Table 4
displays the interaction regression equations for males and females. The interaction BMI model
accounted for 10% of the variance and showed significant associations for ln Ocdd (p = 0.0091) and ln
DDT (p = 0.0020) (Table 3). The model also revealed significant gender interactions with
ln hpcdd (p = 0.0033) and ln DDT (p = 0.0060) (Table 3). Ln Ocdd was positively associated with BMI
increasing by 0.541 for every SD unit increase in ln Ocdd (Table 3).

Note. WC stands for waist circumference. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.
The interaction WC model accounted for 18% of the WC variance and showed significant
associations for ln Ocdd (p = 0.0120) and ln DDT (p = 0.0010) (Table 3). The model also showed
significant gender interactions with ln hpcdd (p = 0.0059) and ln DDT (p = 0.0003) (Table 3). Similar
to the previous model, WC increased by 4.259 centimeters for every SD unit increase in ln Ocdd
(Table 3). Although the WC interaction was positive for ln hpcdd, male WC tended to increase
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2996
by 2.305 centimeters whereas females decreased by 2.504 centimeters for every SD unit increase ln
hpcdd (Table 4). For the ln DDT interaction, male BMI decreased by 0.852 while female BMI
increased by 2.041 for every SD unit increase in ln DDT (Table 4). The joint test p-value for
simultaneous testing for the interactions in the interaction WC model is <0.00005.
Lastly, the interaction WC model controlling for BMI accounted for 88% of the WC variance and
showed significant associations for ln hpcdd (p = 0.0060) with a significant gender by ln DDT
interaction (p = 0.0056) (Table 3). Not surprisingly, age and BMI were both positively associated with
WC. However, as in the previous model, WC decreased by 0.452 cm for every SD unit increase in ln
hpcdd (Table 3). The significant interaction shows that male WC decreases by 0.120 cm whereas
female WC increases by 0.111 cm for every SD unit increase in ln DDT (Table 4). The joint test
p-value for simultaneously testing for the interactions in the interaction WC model controlling for BMI
is 0.0050.
3.3. Secondary (Sensitivity) Analysis
3.3.1. Additive Model
Results of the additive regression models for participants with detectable POPs are presented
in Table 5.
The additive BMI model accounted for 13% of the BMI variance and showed significant
associations for ethnicity (p = 0.0450), age (p < 0.00005), age squared (p < 0.00005), ln
trans-nonachlor (p = 0.0483), and ln DDT (p = 0.0340) (Table 5). With the exception of ln
trans-nonachlor, all of the effects were the same and in the same direction as in the primary additive
BMI model. Here BMI decreases by 1.514 for every SD unit increase in ln trans-nonachlor (Table 5).
The joint test for simultaneously testing the POPs was significant with p = 0.0017. The model
accounted for 2.8% of BMI.
For the additive WC model, significant associations, and in the same direction, for
gender (p < 0.00005), age (p < 0.00005), and age squared (p < 0.00005) appeared (Table 5). However,
unlike the additive WC model for all participants, ln Ocdd was not significant. The model accounted
for 20% of the variance (Table 5). The joint test for simultaneously testing for the POPs was significant
with (p = 0.0129).
For the additive WC model controlling for BMI, the model accounted for 87% of the WC variance
(Table 5). With the exception of ln hpcdd, the same significant associations in the same direction were
observed as with the model with all participants. Here, ln hpcdd was marginally significant
(p = 0.0527), but it was still in the same direction. The joint test simultaneously testing all POPs was
not significant.

3.3.2. Interaction Models
Table 6 displays the results of the interaction regression models for participants with detectable
POPs, and Table 7 displays the interaction regression equations for males and females. The interaction
BMI model accounted for 15% of the variance and showed the same significant associations for
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2998
age (p < 0.00005), age squared (p < 0.00005), ln Ocdd (p = 0.0277), and ln DDT (p = 0.0340) (Table 6).
However, here there were no significant gender interactions with ln hpcdd or ln DDT. Instead, there
was a gender interaction with ln oxychlordane (p = 0.0204) (Table 6). Further, inspection of the
interactions through Table 7 shows that male BMI increases by 3.483 and female BMI decreases
by 0.323 for every SD unit increase in ln oxychlordane (Table 7). The simultaneous test for the gender
by POPs interactions was significant with p = 0.0121.

Note. WC stands for waist circumference. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. Joint Test
refers to the simultaneous test of all two-way gender by POPs interactions.
The interaction WC model accounted for 23% of the variance and showed significant associations
for gender (p = 0.0112), age (p < 0.00005), age squared (p < 0.00005), ln Ocdd (p = 0.0123), and ln
DDT (p = 0.0184) (Table 6). The significant associations were in the same direction as the interaction
WC model with all participants. The model also showed significant gender interactions with ln
oxychlordane (p = 0.0119) and DDT (p = 0.0409) (Table 6). The gender by ln hpcdd was not
significant in this model. The gender by ln oxychlordane interaction was in the same direction as the
primary WC model. Table 7 shows that for the gender by ln Ocdd interaction male WC decreases
by 0.398 and female BMI increases by 6.054 for every SD unit increase in ln Ocdd. The gender by
DDT interaction indicates that male WC decreases by 0.193 and female WC increases by 2.260 for
every SD unit increase in DDT. The joint test for simultaneously testing for the gender by POPs
interactions was significant with (p = 0.0011).
Finally, the interaction WC model controlling for BMI accounted for 88% of the WC variance with
significant main associations for ethnicity(p = 0.0299), age (p = 0.0105), BMI (p < 0.00005), BMI
squared (p = 0.0211), and ln hpcdd (p = 0.0214) (Table 6). The ethnicity main effect was the only
difference in main effects between the current model and primary WC conditional on BMI model.
Even so, it appears that African Americans have 2.05 lower WC than other races. With regard to
interactions, there are significant gender-by-ln hpcdd (p = 0.0283), and gender-by-ln oxychlordane
(p = 0.0231) interactions (Table 6). The gender-by-ln DDT interaction was not significant here.
Inspection of Table 7 shows that male BMI increases by 0.129 and female BMI decreases by 0.917 for
every SD unit increase in ln hpcdd. However, male BMI increases by 1.577 whereas female BMI
decreases by 1.793 for every SD unit increase in ln oxychlordane (Table 7). The joint test for
simultaneously testing the gender-by- POPs interactions was significant with p = 0.0012.

3.3.3. Comparison of All Participants and Participants with Detectable POPs Models
. WC stands for waist circumference. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.
Consistent findings for the additive models with all participant and participants with detectable
POPs were as follows: The additive BMI models showed consistent associations for ethnicity, age, age
squared, and ln DDT. For the additive WC model, the consistent associations were for gender, age, and
ln Ocdd. Lastly, the additive WC model controlling for BMI show consistent finding for gender, age,
BMI, and BMI squared.
Consistent findings for the interaction models for all participants and participants with detectable
POPs were as follows: The interaction BMI model showed consistent associations for age, age squared,
and ln Ocdd. The interaction WC model showed consistent associations for age, ln Ocdd, and ln DDT.
In addition, it had consistent gender by ln oxychlordane and ln DDT interactions. Lastly, the interaction
WC model controlling for BMI had consistent associations for age, BMI, BMI squared, and ln hpcdd.
Lastly, the additive and interaction models were estimated with all participants ages 19 and up
(results not shown but available upon request). Results of these analyses were consistent with the
results of the equivalent models with all participants. Specifically, all parameter estimates were in the
same directions and those that were significant (or not significant) remained significant (or not
significant). The one exception occurred with the interaction model of waist circumference controlling
for BMI. In this model the parameter estimate for European Americans went from non significant to
significant and the parameter estimate for age went from significant to non significant.

4. Conclusions
Consistent effects were found for Ocdd and/or DDT with BMI. In addition, a relatively consistent
association between WC and hpcdd controlling for BMI was found. To the extent that our associations
can be speculated to represent causation, on average, one of the toxic effects of these chemicals appears
to be weight gain. Unlike the well-known weight loss resulting from high exposure to POPs, this
weight gain may occur at much lower levels of exposure, levels which fail to make animals or humans
obviously ill [21]. A couple opposite gender effects was also identified. Oxychlordane is associated
with BMI increases in males but a BMI decreases in females (Tables 6 and 7). Conversely, DTT is
associated with WC decreases in males but WC increases in females (Table 4). A speculation, which
needs further validation, is that this might have to do with hormonally-directed differences in fat
storage in men versus women. Men tend to be "apples" and store their fat in the waist, whereas females
tend to be "pears" and store their fat in their hips. POPs might be affecting this process.
Because of their previous extensive usage as pesticides, their inherent structural stability, their
persistence in body systems and their ability to concentrate in animals that are higher up on the food
chain, many POPs are currently present in human fat in relatively high levels. Much of any chemical-
induced weight gain may come from increases in the overall proportion of body fat. In one animal
study, the pesticide dieldrin more than doubled the total body-fat content of treated mice [22]. Another
study showed that a pesticide, commonly known as lindane, induced obesity in animals [23]. In yet
another study, the overall weight gain effect of another pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, appeared to be so
powerful that a group of treated animals still managed to gain significantly more weight despite the fact
that their food intake was cut by 50% relative to untreated controls that were on full food
rations [24].
Persistent organic pollutants, synthetic and industrial chemicals, appear to cause weight gain by
interfering with most of the different elements that comprise the human weight control system. In
particular, these chemicals have been shown to disrupt major weight controlling hormones, such as
thyroid hormones, estrogens, testosterone, corticosteroids, insulin, growth hormone, and leptin [25]
and to alter levels of, and sensitivity to, neurotransmitters (in particular dopamine, noradrenaline, and
serotonin [26]. They interfere with many metabolic processes and cause widespread damage to body
tissues and cardiovascular disease [27]. This interference may result in changes in appetite, in food
efficiency, and in fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism. The desire, and ability, to exercise
also may be affected. These changes have been thought to be responsible for increases in body
weight [21,23,28,29].
What are the contributions of POPs to pre-diabetes and diabetes disorders? Lee and colleagues
have recently shown a dose-response relation between serum concentrations of POPs and metabolic
syndrome [17], insulin resistance [18], and diabetes [19]. They claimed that the expected association
between obesity and diabetes was absent with people with low concentrations of POPs [19]. However,
Porta argues that the adjustment for BMI and WC in the published studies might be an over
adjustment, because dietary fats are a major source of POPs [36].
These investigators determined that POPs have a much greater association with these diseases in
obese people compared with non-obese people. They hypothesize that the toxicity of POPs related to
the risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes substantially increases as people get

more obese [17]. However, another possibility is that POPs, in addition to their contribution to
metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes, might also directly contribute to obesity. The
complex interactions among POPs, obesity, and diabetes-related disorders make the determination of
the contribution of a single component difficult. Long-term longitudinal cohort studies with repeated
measurements of BMI, WC, and POPs levels and continued model organism experimentation could
help solve this problem.
Are environmental chemicals responsible for the obesity epidemic? Keith and colleagues coined the
phrase "The Big Two" to refer to two commonly presumed causes of the obesity epidemic, namely
food marketing practices and institutionally-driven reductions in physical activity [30]. The Big Two
are likely contributors, but there are several other likely contributors, such as POPs [30]. The particular
POPs studied herein were chosen in this study because they are present in over 80% of the NHANES
population. However, the concentrations of some POPs in general have been decreasing in the past two
decades in the U.S. population because of stricter regulation [31], whereas obesity has been increasing
during this same period. According to NHANES data, obesity (i.e., BMI > 30) has increased from
almost 30% of the adult population in 1980 to over 60% of the population in 2000 [31]. How then can
we explain the strong dose-response relation between serum concentrations of POPs and obesity? A
possibility is that the effects of the POPs were on neonates 20 years ago, and that this is only now
becoming manifest in the adult population. This theory is called the "developmental origins of health
and disease" (DOHaD), or the "Barker hypothesis," because it was first proposed by Barker
and colleagues [32].
An excellent example of DOHaD that is related to POPs and obesity is recent work done by Retha
Newbold and colleagues [16,33]. In pioneering work started in the 1970s, Dr. Newbold and colleagues
showed that the potent estrogenic compound diethylstilbesterol (DES) can increase the incidence of
uterine cancer and testicular atrophy in the children and grandchildren of pregnant mothers given this
compound, which was used in humans to treat morning sickness [34,35]. In recent studies, they
showed that low doses of DES (0.001 mg/kg) given every day for the first 5 days after birth can induce
obesity in post-pubertal mice [16,33]. Whether a similar phenomenon occurs in humans will be the
subject of future investigations.
