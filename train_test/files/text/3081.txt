Background: Use of the Internet for health informa-
tion continues to grow rapidly, but its impact on health
care is unclear. Concerns include whether patients' ac-
cess to large volumes of information will improve their
health; whether the variable quality of the information
will have a deleterious effect; the effect on health dis-
parities; and whether the physician-patient relationship
will be improved as patients become more equal part-
ners, or be damaged if physicians have difficulty adjust-
ing to a new role.
Methods: Telephone survey of nationally representa-
tive sample of the American public, with oversample of
people in poor health.
Results: Of the 3209 respondents, 31% had looked for
health information on the Internet in the past 12 months,
16% had found health information relevant to themselves
and 8% had taken information from the Internet to their
physician. Looking for information on the Internet showed
astrongdigitaldivide;however,onceinformationhadbeen
lookedfor,socioeconomicfactorsdidnotpredictotherout-
comes. Most (71%) people who took information to the
physicianwantedthephysician'sopinion,ratherthanaspe-
cific intervention. The effect of taking information to the
physician on the physician-patient relationship was likely
to be positive as long as the physician had adequate com-
munication skills, and did not appear challenged by the pa-
tient bringing in information.
Conclusions: For health information on the Internet to
achieve its potential as a force for equity and patient well-
being, actions are required to overcome the digital di-
vide; assist the public in developing searching and ap-
praisal skills; and ensure physicians have adequate
communication skills.

ALTHOUGH USE of the Inter-
net continues to grow rap-
idly, its impact on health
care is unclear. The advan-
tages of the Internet as a
source of health information include con-
venient access to a massive volume of in-
formation,easeofupdatinginformation,and
thepotentialforinteractiveformatsthatpro-
mote understanding and retention of infor-
mation. Health information on the Inter-
net may make patients better informed,
leading to better health outcomes, more ap-
propriateuseofhealthserviceresources,and
a stronger physician-patient relationship.1
However, health information on the Inter-
net may be misleading or misinterpreted,
compromising health behaviors and health
outcomes, or resulting in inappropriate re-
quests for clinical interventions.2,3 Physi-
cians may accede to inappropriate re-
quests, either because refusal is time-
consuming or because they fear refusal
would weaken the physician-patient rela-
tionship.4,5 Respondingtoinappropriatepa-
tient requests may be particularly difficult
in managed care, where patients may be-
lieve that physician refusals may be moti-
vated by the need to control costs.6
A second area of uncertainty is the im-
pact of the Internet on health disparities.
The Internet might reduce disparities if
health information becomes available to
disadvantaged groups. However, it might
increase disparities if only higher socio-
economic groups are able to access health
information, distinguish accurate from in-
accurate information, and apply it to their
personal situation.
Finally, it is unclear how health in-
formation on the Internet will affect the
physician-patient relationship, the cor-
nerstone of good medical care. Will it im-
prove the relationship, as patients be-
come more active partners in their own
health care? Or will physicians have dif-
ficulty adjusting as they no longer have
unique access to medical information?
The evidence to date on these ques-
tions is scanty. Surveys of Internet use by

the public have tended to use skewed samples, such as
Internet users,7 patients with specific conditions,8,9 or
health care providers.10 These surveys are unable to pro-
vide population-based estimates of Internet use, its re-
lationship to socioeconomic status, and patient con-
cerns about the accuracy of health information on the
Internet.
To analyze these issues, we undertook a large, popu-
lation-based survey to determine the public's use of the
Internet for health information; their views about the qual-
ity and effect of the information available; ability to ap-
praise such information; impact on the physician-
patient relationship; and impact on health service
utilization. Previous studies have ascertained how often
patientsseekhealthinformationontheInternet.Ourstudy
goes further, by determining how often patients take in-
formation from the Internet to a physician and explor-
ing what happens when this is done.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The survey was carried out between March 2000 and March
2001 on a household probability sample from the 48 contigu-
ous states. Households were selected through computerized ran-
dom digit dialing generated through the Genesys Sampling Sys-
tem. This stratified sampling technique ensured proper
representation of households in different regions of the coun-
try and in central city, suburban, and rural areas. Random-
digit selection also ensures sample representation of persons
in households with "unlisted" telephone numbers. To ensure
a random selection of respondents at household level, partici-
pants were selected on the "most recent birthday" technique
that screens for an adult, 18 years or older, living in the house-
hold, who has had the most recent birthday.
Verbal informed consent was obtained from all respon-
dents before they began the interview. Eligibility was limited
to English and Spanish speakers without cognitive or physical
impairments that prevented completion of the interview. A small
financial incentive was offered for completion of the inter-
view. Where telephone numbers of nonrespondents could be
matched with an address, a maximum of 2 letters were sent to
encourage response. The average administration time was 20
minutes. All interviews were conducted by trained interview-
ers using computer-assisted telephone interviewing.
An oversample of individuals in poor health was achieved
by screening a random subsample of households and includ-
ing only respondents who described their health as fair or poor
(rather than excellent, very good, or good); had a disability or
handicap that prevented them from participating fully in school,
work, housework, or other activities; or had been hospitalized
within the past 12 months, for reasons other than a normal de-
livery.
INTERVIEW AND DATA COLLECTION
The survey instrument was developed following literature re-
view and focus groups and was pretested on 92 individuals. The
interview was described as a survey on health issues, in par-
ticular how Americans make decisions about health care and
their feelings about the health care available to them. No men-
tion was made about the Internet in characterizing the study.
The first substantive questions were about different sources of
health information. Subsequent questions identified respon-
dents who had looked for health information on the Internet
in the last 12 months and explored their experience of this, their
perceptions of the quality of such information, their self-rated
ability to assess quality, and the use they had made of the in-
formation. The final set of questions identified respondents who
had looked for health information on the Internet, found rel-
evant information, and taken this information to their physi-
cian. These questions concerned patient expectations of tak-
ing the information to their physician, their perceptions of, and
satisfaction with, the subsequent consultation, the impact on
health service utilization, and the effect on the physician-
patient relationship.
Demographic and socioeconomic data, including age,
self-defined ethnic origin, educational achievement, house-
hold income per annum, health insurance status, and current
health status were collected from all respondents. All respon-
dents were also asked whether they had a relationship with a
regular physician, whether they were in managed care, and
how well they rated the overall level of care from their regular
physician. All these independent variables were run against all
outcome variables. For patients who brought information on
the Internet to their physician, we derived an overall commu-
nication skill score by summing across 6 component ratings
(on a 5-point scale: excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),
including the amount of time spent discussing information,
the physician's listening skills, how well they answered ques-
tions, their openness to the information, how seriously they
considered the information, and the final decision or recom-
mendation. A score of 18, corresponding to value at which the
average value of the component parts was 3 (good) was used
to dichotomize the scores into "high" (18) or "low."
Respondents were defined as being proactive about health
care information if they stated they went out of their way to
look for information on health topics of personal relevance,
rather than simply reading it if they came across it, or not
reading any such information.
ANALYSIS
Weighting
To maximize the generalizability of the results, data were
weighted to adjust for unequal probability of selection (includ-
ing the oversample of individuals in poor health). To adjust
for survey nonresponse, stratification weights were developed
using the March 2000 Current Population Survey from the US
Census Bureau as standard. The poststratification weights were
based on gender within age within race, as well as education,
health insurance status (insured vs uninsured), and house-
hold size. This weighting procedure results in a sample that is
representative of the US population.
Analytic Procedures
Univariate relationships between independent variables and the
dependent variables (looking for health information on the In-
ternet, effect on physician-patient relationship, and any result-
ant change in health care) were calculated using the 2 statis-
tic or Fisher exact test. Variables with significant univariate
relationships (P.05) were entered into logistic regression. As
we had no a priori hypotheses, all variables with a significant
univariate relationship were entered into the logistic regres-
sion, and an iterative process of forward and backward step-
wise regression was undertaken to determine which variables
provided the best fit for the model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow
goodness-of-fit test was applied, and all results of multivariate
analyses reported come from final models with adequate fit, de-
fined as P.2. As all data were weighted, the appropriate pro-
cedures to correct P values and SEs were undertaken. We used

the SVYTAB procedure in STATA to obtain the Rao and Scott
F test P values,11 and the SVYLOGIT procedure in STATA to
obtain corrected SEs for parameter estimates.
Response Rate
A total of 3209 interviews were completed, including 489 in
the oversample. This represents a completion rate of 72% for
the main sample and 95% for the oversample and an adjusted
overall response rate of 54%.
Response rates were maximized by making at least 15 at-
tempts to contact each number. Where it was possible to cor-
relate numbers with addresses, up to 2 letters were sent, ex-
plaining the purpose of the interview and encouraging response.
A small incentive ($10-$50) was offered for completing the in-
terview and was accepted by 75% of respondents.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS
Both unweighted and weighted data for demographic and
other characteristics of the 3209 respondents (includ-
ing health status, insurance status, and satisfaction with
care) are presented in Table 1. This table provides a mea-
sure of the representativeness of our sample; after the data
have been weighted the sample has demographic char-
acteristics statistically identical to those of the national
population. The differences between the unweighted and
weighted data are small, providing reassurance that even
without weighting the obtained sample was similar to that
of the US population.
The Figure presents the flow of respondents through
the survey instrument. Because more detailed questions
presuppose certain conditions, sample size diminishes.
All data reported from this point on are weighted data.
SEEKING HEALTH INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET
Of the 3209 interviewees, 31% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 29%-33%; n=983) had looked for health infor-
mation in the past 12 months. The factors that were most
strongly associated with looking for information were so-
cioeconomic. Younger, wealthier, better educated people
were more likely to have looked for information

(Table 2), with education being the most important fac-
tor. African Americans were less likely than whites to look
for information. Multivariate analysis showed that other
factors independently associated with looking for infor-
mation on the Internet were being in good health, hav-
ing a proactive approach to health care information, and
rating the quality of care from a regular physician as only
fair or poor. For the sake of clarity, only factors that were
significant in the univariate analysis are shown in Table
2. Several important variables were not independently as-
sociated with looking for health information, including
gender, having a physician who encouraged patients to
look for information, and being in managed care.
FINDING HEALTH INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET
Three quarters (75%; 95% CI, 71%-78%; n=728) of the
people who had looked for health information on the In-
ternet found information relevant to their own health
(53%; 95% CI, 49%-57%; n=513), or the health of friends
or relatives (57%; 95% CI, 53%-61%; n=557). Success
in finding information relevant to the respondent's own
health was associated with being proactive about health
information (57% vs 49%; P=.03) and being in poor health
(59% vs 51%; P=.05). Failure to find any relevant infor-
mation was more prevalent in African Americans than

other racial groups (39% vs 24%; P=.05), but no other
demographic or health care factors were associated.
Most people (81%; 95% CI, 78%-84%) who had
looked for information on the Internet found it easy to
find information they perceived to be of high quality. How-
ever, there was widespread concern about the reliability
of Internet information, with 72% (95% CI, 69%-76%)
describing themselves as very or somewhat concerned
about this. Only 35% (95% CI, 31%-38%) thought that
they were excellent or very good at determining whether
information on a Web site was reliable. Self-rated ability
in appraising information was not related to educa-
tional status or any other socioeconomic or health sta-
tus factors. However, respondents who viewed them-
selves as proactive about seeking health care information
were more likely to consider themselves excellent or very
good at appraising sites than those who did not go out
of their way to look for health information (43% vs 28%;
P.001).
Respondents who had looked for health informa-
tion on the Internet in the last 12 months were over-
whelmingly positive about it. When asked about the effect
of the information in general, 97% (95% CI, 95%-98%)
believed that it gave patients more confidence to talk to
a physician about their concerns, 96% (95% CI, 94%-
97%) believed that it improved patients' understanding
of their condition, and 85% (95% CI, 82%-88%) thought
that it encouraged patients to follow their physician's ad-
vice. Ninety-three percent (95% CI, 91%-94%) reported
that having access to such information challenged phy-
sicians to be more up-to-date with the latest treatments.
Respondents recognized that there might be some ad-
verse effects to the information, with 39% (95% CI, 36%-
43%) agreeing that it could cause unnecessary visits to a
physician, 37% (95% CI, 34%-41%) thinking that it caused
patients to take up more of their physician's time, and
22% (95% CI, 19%-25%) saying that it could interfere
with the physician-patient relationship.
When asked about the effect of looking for infor-
mation on them personally, respondents remained very
positive. Eighty-six percent (95% CI, 83%-88%) said that
it had helped their understanding of their problem, 74%
(95% CI, 71%-78%) said that it been beneficial to their
decision-making ability, 69% (95% CI, 65%-72%) said
that the information had helped them take better care of
their health, and 62% (95% CI, 59%-66%) said it had im-
proved communication with their physician. For each of
these questions, fewer than 1% said that the informa-
tion had been harmful; the remainder believed it had a
neutral effect.
TAKING HEALTH INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET TO THE PHYSICIAN
Of the 513 people who had found information relevant
to their own health, 50% (95% CI, 45%-55%; n=256)
had taken the information to their physician. The main
reasons for not taking information to the physician were
that it was not important enough (42%) or that they had
just wanted to be informed (11%). Relatively few people
had scheduled a visit to their physician specifically (4%;
95% CI, 2%-7%) or partly (14%; 95% CI, 9%-21%) to
discuss information they had found on the Internet.
Rather, they had needed to see the physician anyway
and used the opportunity to mention information found
on the Internet.
The main factors associated with taking informa-
tion to the physician were respondents' self-rated ability
to critically appraise health information on the Internet
and their health status. Respondents who rated them-
selves as excellent or very good at assessing the reliabil-
ity of information on the Internet were more likely to take
information than respondents who rated themselves as
good, fair, or poor (61% vs 44%; P=.004). People in poor
health were more likely to talk to their physician about
information than those in good health (62% vs 47%;
P=.007), as were patients whose physicians encouraged
them to look for information compared with those whose
physician did not encourage them to do so (58% vs 42%;
P=.05). No demographic or health care factors (includ-
ing being in managed care) were associated, nor was the
frequency with which respondents used the Internet for
health information, their concern about the reliability of
Internet information, or whether they found it easy or
difficult to find good information on the Internet.
Of the 256 people who took information to the phy-
sician, 71% (95% CI, 64%-77%) stated they did so be-
cause they just wanted the physician's opinion about the
information, rather than wanting the physician to do
something specific such as order a test, change medica-
tion, or arrange a referral. Patients who were confident
about their ability to critically appraise Web sites (self-
rated skill excellent or very good vs good, fair, or poor)
were more likely to want the physician to do something
specific (39% vs 22%; P=.009). Similarly, people who use
the Internet frequently for finding health information were
more likely to want the physician to do something spe-
cific than those who seldom use it (32% vs 14%; P.001),
as were people who rated their regular physician's care
as fair or poor rather than good, very good, or excellent
(50% vs 27.5%; P=.03). Demographic and care factors
appeared to have no impact on wanting something spe-
cific done.
Taking information to the physician was perceived
as beneficial by the patients, with 83% (95% CI, 77%-
88%) reporting that they felt more in control, and 78%
(95% CI, 72%-83%) stating they felt more confident dur-
ing the consultation as a result. Only 6% (95% CI, 4%-
11%) of patients reported negative feelings, such as em-
barrassment as a result of taking information to their
physician, but 15% (95% CI, 10%-21%) had felt hurried
during the consultation.
Patients perceived that the physicians reacted posi-
tively in 67% (95% CI, 60%-73%) of cases, neutrally in
27% (95% CI, 21%-33%), and negatively in only 7% (95%
CI, 4%-12%). However, 15% (95% CI, 10%-22%) of re-
spondents reported that their physician had "acted chal-
lenged" when they brought the information in. Physi-
cians of uninsured patients were much more likely to act
challenged than those treating insured patients (48% vs
12%; P=.02). Patients who described themselves as ex-
cellent or very good at critically appraising information

were patients who perceived the overall level of care from
their physician as fair or poor rather than excellent, very
good, or good (32% vs 14%; P=.03). No other demo-
graphic, health care, or use of Internet factors were as-
sociated with the physician acting challenged.
Taking information on the Internet to their physi-
cian could have a positive or negative impact on the phy-
sician-patient relationship, depending on the physi-
cian's reactions and communication skills (Table 3).
Thirty percent (95% CI, 23%-37%) of respondents stated
that the relationship had been improved; 66% (95% CI,
59%-73%) said it had remained the same, and only 4%
(95% CI, 2%-8%) said that it had worsened. If the pa-
tient felt more in control during the consultation, the re-
lationship was likely to be improved. However, the re-
lationship was likely to be damaged if the physician was
perceived by the patient as "acting challenged," if the pa-
tient rated the communication skills of the physician as
inadequate, or if the patient felt hurried during the con-
sultation.
Several variables did not affect the physician-
patient relationship. Feelings of embarrassment or in-
creased confidence had no impact. Twenty-six percent
of the people who asked their physician for a test, change
in medication, or referral did not get any of these inter-
ventions. This did not appear to have an impact on the
physician-patient relationship, as these people were no
more likely than people who got what they requested to
consider that the relationship had deteriorated or im-
proved after the visit. Demographic and health care fac-
tors were not associated with a positive or negative im-
pact on the physician-patient relationship.
As a result of dissatisfaction with the consultation,
12% of the 256 respondents who brought information
to their physician sought a second opinion from an-
other physician, 4% changed their physician, and 1%
changed their health plan. Overall, 17% (95% CI, 12%-
23%) carried out at least one of these actions. Such se-
rious dissatisfaction was strongly related to the physi-
cian's communication skills and perceived reaction to the
information (Table 4). In particular, if the physician was
perceived as being threatened by the patient bringing in-
formation in, 49% of patients evinced serious dissatis-
faction as defined above, compared with 11% of pa-
tients whose physician was not perceived as acting
challenged. Other important predictors of seeking a sec-
ond opinion or changing health care provider or plan were
feeling hurried during the consultation, or rating the phy-
sician's communication skills as only fair or poor. Demo-
graphic and health care factors were not associated.
COMMENT
This is the first large population-based survey to go be-
yond patients' use of the Internet for health information
and examine the use patients make of the information
once they have found it. These data have substantial im-
plications regarding public access to the Internet; pa-
tients' ability to find, appraise, and use health informa-
tion; and the resulting impact on health service utilization
and on the physician-patient relationship.
ACTION TO OVERCOME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
We found lower rates of using the Internet to obtain health
information in this general population sample than have
been previously reported in surveys of people with In-
ternet access. Lack of access to the Internet may be a bar-
rier to wider use of online sources of health informa-
tion.12 Although we found a strong digital divide in terms
of access to health information on the Internet, once ac-
cess has been achieved, socioeconomic status and edu-
cation do not predict whether patients find relevant in-
formation or bring it to physicians. Hence, if access to
the Internet can be made more equitable, disadvantaged
populations may be able to reap the benefits of health
information on the Internet. Other studies have found
that providing Internet access can reduce disparities in
health outcomes.13
ASSISTANCE WITH
FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION
One quarter of respondents who looked for health in-
formation on the Internet were unable to find relevant
information. Because this was not related to educational
status, it is unlikely to be due to problems with spelling
or literacy levels. Thus additional strategies are needed
to help people locate pertinent information once they are
online.

ASSISTANCE WITH APPRAISING INFORMATION
We found widespread concern about the reliability of
information on the Internet, and only one third of
respondents were comfortable with their ability to
appraise information. Current proposals to help patients
assess online information include "kitemarking" (seals
of approval) of health sites and development of trusted
Web sites.14 The large number and rapid growth of Web
sites makes kitemarking infeasible,15 while promoting
the use of trusted Web sites is unlikely to be successful
given that 50% of our sample did not know the site on
which they found information. Other reports suggest
that people do not visit specific Web sites for health
information, but instead use search engines and visit the
first sites listed.16 Thus, new strategies are needed to
help patients better appraise the quality of medical infor-
mation they find online.
IMPACT ON HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION
Our data do not support concerns that health informa-
tion on the Internet currently results in many requests
for inappropriate care. Moreover, most patients appar-
ently accepted physician judgments that requested in-
terventions were not appropriate. Being in managed care
had no discernible impact on requesting interventions.
However, these data suggest that health information on
the Internet may have a significant impact on physician
time. Although we have no objective measure of time spent
during a consultation, our data show that patients who
felt hurried during a consultation were also more likely
to report serious dissatisfaction and a worsened physician-
patient relationship. Even though only 8% of the sample
took information to the physician, as Internet use be-
comes more prevalent and people become more confi-
dent about their ability to appraise information, more
people are likely to take information to their physician
and request specific interventions.
IMPACT ON
PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP
Our data suggest that patients believe health informa-
tion on the Internet has more positive than negative ef-
fects on the physician-patient relationship. Patients were
more likely to report a worsened physician-patient rela-
tionship if the physician was perceived to have poor com-
munication skills or acted as if their authority had been
challenged, but not when they did not receive requested
interventions. Being in managed care or in disadvan-
taged groups was not associated with a worsened phy-
sician-patient relationship after bringing in information
from the Internet. These findings are consistent with pa-
tients trusting physicians to interpret information they
had obtained independently. Some physicians appear to
have difficulty with this role, either lacking the neces-
sary communication skills to discuss health informa-
tion from the Internet adequately, or acting as if their pro-
fessional authority is being challenged. Results from our
survey of physicians show that visits where the physi-
cian felt challenged were also associated with worsened
quality of care and health outcomes (unpublished data).
There is an urgent need to elucidate the cause of this feel-
ing in order to implement preventive policies. Health care
organizations, medical educators, and professional so-
cieties need to consider how to ensure that their physi-
cians acquire the skills needed to interpret information
brought in by patients, discuss the implications, and ne-
gotiate a mutually acceptable management plan in a cost-
effective manner.
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The major strength of this study lies in its population-
based sampling and inclusion of an oversample of indi-
viduals in poor health who were more likely to look for
health information on the Internet. Although the re-
sponse rate is only moderate, the weighting corrects for
unequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse at the
survey level, maximizing the generalizability of the find-
ings to the entire American population. Approximately
95% of all households in the United States have tele-
phones, and absence of a telephone does not affect health
parameters.17 As the preamble to the interview did not
specify that the topic of interest was the Internet, it is un-
likely that there was systematic bias in the sample due
to differential consent rates among individuals with strong
views about the Internet. Other recent population-
based telephone surveys have achieved similar response

rates,18 with a secular trend to declining survey re-
sponse rates being noted.19 Moreover, Biemer20 has shown
that because the total survey error consists of both over-
all nonresponse rate plus nonresponse to individual ques-
tions, and as the latter is much lower in telephone inter-
views than face-to-face interviews, "a computer-
assisted telephone interviewing survey can produce data
that compare well in quality to those produced by a face
to face survey for many characteristics, despite a differ-
ence in response rates of more than 20 percentage points."
There are some limitations to the study, including
the absence of any objective measurements to confirm
patient perceptions, for example, concerning the appro-
priateness of requests. The relatively small number of
respondents who had sequentially looked for informa-
tion, found information relevant to their own health,
and taken it to the physician for discussion limits the
power of the study at this point. However, we were able
to determine large effect sizes likely to be clinically
important.
CONCLUSIONS
The Internet has the potential to transform access to health
information, thus enhancing patient satisfaction and par-
ticipation in health care. However, some problems must
be addressed before its true potential as a force for eq-
uity and patient well-being can be realized. First, Inter-
net access must be improved for disadvantaged groups.
Second, the public needs to improve their information
search and appraisal skills. This might be achieved through
a combination of government and private actions, in-
cluding tutorials in these skills. Finally, physicians and
trainees need to develop their communication skills to
include discussions about information from the Inter-
net brought by patients.
