Introduction
A number of writers (Abassah, 2011; Adedokun, 2011;
Akinyemi, Ofem, & Ikuenomore, 2012; Dabalen, Oni, &
Adekola, 2000; Nwagwu, 2007; Oyesiku, 2008; Umunadi,
2011; Uwaifo, 2010; Uwaifo & Uwaifo, 2009) have sug-
gested that school leavers from Nigerian schools especially
lack problem-solving abilities. Although it is not generally
clear the sort of problem-solving ability most of the afore-
mentioned writers refer to, Oyesiku (2008) at least alludes to
the fact that graduates from Nigerian schools lack trouble-
shooting skills. This is in spite of the importance of such
problem-solving competence among the citizenry (Custer,
Valesey, & Burke, 2001; Dugger, 2001). According to
Oyesiku (2008), the youths in Nigeria are so badly educated
that majority of them grossly lack even the most basic do-
it-yourself technical skills to do minor repairs and maintenance
jobs like changing motor oil, replacing electric bulbs, fixing
of furniture, and so on. The situation is so pathetic according
to Oyesiku (2008) that a third party is always called to do the
most basic troubleshooting.
Although not every member of society would normally
function as expert at solving technological problems, Dugger
(2001) summarized the importance of citizens generally
becoming technologically savvy when he wrote,
It is particularly important in this technological world that
people understand and are comfortable with the concepts and
workings of modern technology. From a personal standpoint,
people benefit both at work and at home by being able to choose
the best products for their purposes, to operate the products
properly, and to troubleshoot them when something goes wrong.
From a societal standpoint, an informed citizenry improves the
chances that decisions about the use of technology will be made
rationally and responsibly. (p. 2)
Troubleshooting is especially one of the most common
problem-solving abilities required of today's citizens for
everyday functioning. Morris and Rouse (1986) described
the task of troubleshooting simply as "Given a system
that is not functioning properly, the trouble-shooter must
attempt to locate the reason for the malfunction and must
then repair or replace the faulty component" (p. 503).
Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross (1992) observed that
individuals in their everyday lives engage in personal trou-
bleshooting to effect self-change, especially when related to
addictive behaviors. In technical fields, troubleshooting is
normally associated with the repair of physical, chemical,
biological, electronic, or social systems among others.

Student Teachers' Self-Appraised
Problem-Solving Ability and Willingness
to Engage in Troubleshooting Activities
Benedict Iorzer Labe1
Abstract
The purpose of this research was to determine the extent of student teachers' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities
and their technological problem-solving self-appraised ability. The study used a cross-sectional descriptive correlational
design to collect data from 310 purposively random sampled students from three universities in Northern Nigeria. Results
of data analyses indicated that student teachers from the universities surveyed reported a moderate willingness to engage
in troubleshooting activities as well as a moderately positive self-appraisal of their problem-solving ability. The student
teachers' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities was also significantly related to the pattern of their self-appraised
problem-solving ability. It was therefore concluded that the findings from this research do not support the pedestrian view
that students from Nigerian universities are reluctant to engage in problem-solving activities.

In the words of Johnson, Flesher, and Chung (1995),
"Troubleshooting requires that technicians use their knowl-
edge and skill to effectively interact with a complex tech-
nical system that is behaving in some unusual way" (p. 1).
Jonassen and Hung (2006) noted that people in the techno-
logical disciplines (e.g., automotive mechanics, electricians,
refrigeration service men) and professionals (physician, ther-
apists, ombudspersons) do troubleshooting every day, diag-
nosing faulty systems and taking direct, corrective action to
eliminate any faults to return systems to their normal states.
Teachers of any technical discipline must first be technicians
in that domain, before they could be effectively disposed to
teach the subject matter. Fernandes (cited in Boser, 1993) made
the point that to teach problem solving (which includes techni-
cal troubleshooting), teachers must themselves be competent
problem solvers who are aware of the methods and processes
that they use. Parr (2006) also stressed that engaging person-
ally in activities, similar to those we arrange for our students,
"supports the principles that we should never ask our students to
do something we are not willing to do ourselves or have not
previously engaged in, and that we should know more than we
teach" (p. 35). Parr further explained that personally engaging in
activities similar to those they would expect of their students
allows teachers to develop the willingness to participate without
hesitation, somewhat automatically and freely, because the
teachers themselves have, in fact, been there before. It is only
through participation and engagement that teachers truly come
to acknowledge the challenges faced by their students and the
demands (instructional and otherwise) that they place on their
students (Parr, 2006). Thus, if the picture painted by Oyesiku
(2008) and others speaks true of the technology teachers in
Nigerian schools, then there is certainly cause for concern.
The most popular reason given for Nigerian school gradu-
ates' poor technological problem-solving ability (and by
extension, troubleshooting ability as observed by Oyesiku,
2008) is that, as students, they do not get opportunities to
develop their capabilities while in school. Plagued by lack of
essential resources like equipment, facilities, materials, and
funds (Abassah, 2011; Adedokun, 2011; Umunadi, 2011;
Uwaifo, 2010), the predominant teaching approach, even in
technical education programs, is the lecture method (Uwaifo,
2010). Some authors (Adedokun, 2011; Adigwe, 1991) are of
the view that the teachers sometimes teach only theoretical
content because they are themselves not properly trained. This
presupposes that as the graduates could not accumulate enough
problem-solving experiences while in school, they cannot be
expected to do well on such tasks out of school. Of course,
past experiences from which to draw ideas, are key to success-
ful problem solving (scientific, technological or general), the
most enduring of such experiences are often acquired tacitly
"on the job" rather than explicitly in formal instructional
settings. Given this reality, it is essential we recognize the
importance of individuals' willingness to engage in problem
solving tasks as deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2006; Ericsson,
Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993) to intentionally cultivate their
expertise both inside and outside of classrooms.
However, there is intuitively an obvious link between how
individuals perceive themselves as problem solvers and their
willingness to engage in problem-solving tasks.Astudent who
is not sure of his or her problem-solving capabilities would
obviously also not be comfortable with investing and exerting
effort in work that could challenge their problem-solving
skills. In the context of learning, this could adversely affect
students' development of their problem-solving capabilities.
There are strong indications that individuals'self-appraisal
of their problem-solving capabilities could influence their
willingness to approach or avoid problem situations. Within
the school setting, Charles and Lester (1982) had pointed
out, "A willingness to engage in problem solving and self-
confidence in one's ability to succeed [are] probably the
most important characteristics a student can bring to the
problem-solving situation" (p. 16). In this study, the defini-
tion of willingness to engage in a problem-solving activity is
adopted from Adelman, MacDonald, Nelson, Smith, and
Taylor (1990) who pointed out that willingness is indicated
by (a) how much the individual wanted to engage in an activ-
ity and (b) how much the individual expected to influence a
course of action. VanDenmark (1991) informed that, all too
often, many students are simply afraid of their ability to solve
problems, or problem-solving activities go wrong simply
because the students got frustrated, apathetic, or embarrassed.
McCroskey (1992) linked self-perception of ability to will-
ingness to perform a task (e.g., to communicate). Brophy
(1999) also observed that if the students do not have the will-
ingness to engage in problem-solving activities, they are
likely to show reluctance or even resistance to engage in such
tasks. When the willingness exists, the individual is primed to
action (such as actively seeking solution to encountered prob-
lems), resistance is reduced (Bouckenooghe & Devos, 2008),
and there could be sustained cognitive, emotional, and behav-
ioral involvement with the problem-solving task.
Thus, to intelligently understand the problem of Nigerian
students and school graduates' reluctance to engage in tech-
nological problem-solving activities, it is necessary to acquire
information regarding (a) whether or not the students per-
ceived themselves as having the personal resources to deal
with technological problems, and (b) whether this perception
influences their willingness to tackle technological problem.
The study used individuals'willingness to engage in technical
troubleshooting activities as a context for investigation.
This study focused on prospective teachers of technology
who are still in training because, sometimes, students'lack of
willingness to engage in problem-solving activities while in
school might be a function of how well their teachers are act-
ing as role models. Research in mathematics education for
instance indicates that, teachers' beliefs about subject matter
have a powerful impact on the practice of teaching. Akinsola
(2008) cited several studies where it has been suggested that
teachers with negative beliefs about a particular domain
could influence a learned helplessness response from stu-
dents. Thus, what goes on in the technological education
classroom with respect to technological problem-solving
Labe 3
disposition may be directly related to the beliefs teachers
hold about technology and its processes.
The purpose of this research therefore was to
1. determine the extent of teacher trainees'willingness to
engage in technological problem-solving activities;
2. determine teacher trainees' self-appraisal of their
technological problem-solving ability;
3. determine the relationship between teacher trainees'
willingness to engage in technological problem-solv-
ing activities and self-appraisal of their technological
problem-solving ability;
4. determine whether there are significant differences
among the teacher trainees in their willingness to
engage in technological problem-solving activities
on the basis of gender, number of years spent in the
university, and program of study; and
5. ascertain whether technical area of specialization,
year of study, gender, or self-appraised technological
problem-solving ability is a significant predictor of
teacher trainees' willingness to engage in technologi-
cal problem-solving activity.
Research Questions
The following research questions guided the study:
Research Question 1: What is the extent of teacher
trainees' willingness to engage in technological problem-
solving activities?
Research Question 2: To what extent do teacher trainees
appraise their technological problem-solving ability?
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: There is no relationship between teacher
trainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activi-
ties and their self-appraised technological problem-solv-
ing ability.
Hypothesis 2: No significant differences exist among the
teacher trainees in their willingness to engage in technologi-
cal problem-solving activities on the basis of gender, num-
ber of years spent in the university, and program of study.
Hypothesis 3: Neither technical area of specialization,
year of study, gender, nor self-appraised technological
problem-solving ability is a significant predictor of
teacher trainees' willingness to engage in technological
problem-solving activities?
Method
The study used a cross-sectional descriptive correlational
design. Respondents' self-report of their thoughts was col-
lected through a structured questionnaire and used to describe
the student teachers' self-appraised problem-solving ability,
willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities, as well as
to explore relationships and variations among these variables.
The area of the study was Northern Nigeria and covered
all the universities that provide technical teacher training.
According to figures obtained from the Research and Statistics
unit of the National Universities Commission (NUC; 2012),
Northern Nigeria has 38 universities, four of which offer
teacher training in industrial technology education.
Sample
All the students surveyed in this study were enrolled in either
a 4- or 5-year Industrial Technical/Technology Teacher
Training leading to award of a first degree. Purposive ran-
dom sampling was adopted to survey all the students enrolled
into the last 2 to 3 years of study in the Industrial Technology/
Technical Education program of the universities. This gave a
sample size of 310 students. The sample was chosen because
they would have undertaken at least one practical technical
problem-solving task during the course of their enrollment
into the technical teacher training program at the current
institution.
Instruments for Data Collection
Data for the following variables were collected in this study
using the following measures:
1. The Survey of Willingness to Engage in Trouble-
shooting Activity (SWETA) was used to assess
students' willingness to engage in technological
problem-solving activities. The SWETA is a 24-item
researcher-developed survey and was administered
as part of a 45-item instrument. The SWETA asks the
participants to indicate the extent to which a given
statement is true of what they do or think, or how
they feel about having to work on the task that
requires them to find solution to problems with things
such as lights that would not light, an automobile or
electric motor that will not start, doors that stick and
make noise, or a computer or some other equipment
that would not work at all or not work properly.
Responses are indexed on a scale of 1 = not at all
true to 6 = completely true.
2. The Problem-Solving Inventory­Technological
(PSI-TECH)­Form B (Heppner, 1988; Wu, Custer,
& Dyrenfurth, 1996) was used to assess students'
appraisal of their technological problem-solving
ability. The PSI-TECH is a self-report measure
that assesses respondents' perceptions of their tech-
nological problem-solving confidence, approach/
avoidance styles, and personal control over emotions
during a technological problem-solving activity.
Written on a fifth-grade reading level, Form B of the
PSI-TECH is usually completed on a 6-point scale: 1
= really agree, 2 = mostly agree, 3 = agree, a little,
4 = disagree, a little, 5 = mostly disagree, 6 = really
disagree.
4 SAGE Open
The researcher-developed SWETA was face validated on
the bases of clarity and appropriateness for the study by
a professor of industrial education at the Illinois State
University who has established research interest in techno-
logical problem solving. These scales were also face vali-
dated by a senior lecturer in counseling psychology and
another senior lecturer in technical teacher training both at
the Benue State University. Following suggestions made by
these three reviewers, the researcher made modifications to
the questionnaires.
Prior to analyses for the purpose of describing the re-
spondents'willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities,
the SWETA was subjected to principal component analysis
(PCA) with varimax orthogonal rotation (Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin
measure = .676, Bartlett's test of sphericity value < .000) as
part of a 45-item survey. Although the PCA initially produced
an eight-component solution by eigenvalue, the scree criteria
suggested that a two-factor solution was more appropriate fit
for the data collected. A two-factor solution was subsequently
forced, with the level of significance set to .03 to accommo-
date the sample size (Tabechnick & Fidell, cited in Casey,
Day, Howells, & Ward, 2007). The two components accounted
for 33.16% of the common variance in scale items. However,
on close scrutiny of the two components, it was realized that
they could just be two dimensions of the same construct, will-
ingness. Component 1, which consisted of 17 items, indicated
the reluctance to engage in the troubleshooting activity.
Component 2, however, consisted of 7 items indicating the
individuals' eagerness to engage in the activity.
The various scales comprising the measure of the SWETA
were tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha.
Analysis of the internal consistency statistic was performed
using IBM SPSS 21 statistics® software. This analysis indi-
cated a Cronbach's  = .742, for the total scale of 24 items. The
17 items in Component 1 (reluctance to engage in the trouble-
shooting activity) together indicated Cronbach's  = .795,
while the 7 items comprising Component 2 measuring eager-
ness to engage in the activity indicated Cronbach's  = .772.
The PSI-TECH (Heppner, 1988; Wu et al., 1996) that was
used in this study is a published survey that has been vali-
dated in a number of studies. For instance, Wu et al. (1996)
informed that "previous conceptual and empirical studies of
personal problem solving . . . have validated the three dimen-
sions of the PSI" (p. 57). Heppner, Witty, and Dixon (2004)
also documented a range of studies that provide a wealth of
data supporting the validity of the PSI. In the present study,
the total PSI scores indicated a Cronbach's  = .77.
Analysis of Data
In line with the purposes of study, descriptive and inferential
data analysis procedures were used. Data that provided
answers to Research Questions 1 and 2 were analyzed using
means and standard deviations. Data that provided answers to
Hypothesis 1 were analyzed using Pearson's product-moment
correlation coefficients. Data that yielded results for
Hypothesis 2 were analyzed using one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA). Data that provided results for Hypothesis 3
were analyzed using simultaneous linear multiple regression
analysis.
Willingness was assessed with 24 items that the respon-
dents rated on a 6-point scale. For the purpose of analysis
and reporting, these 24 items were combined into an index
with total willingness scores ranging from 24 to 144 with a
median score of 84. This was done by multiplying each point
on the rating scale by the total number of items in the ques-
tionnaire relating to the construct willingness to engage in
troubleshooting activity. Subsequently, the willingness
scores were divided into three categories using a quartile
split. The lower quartile split at the score of 54, the middle
quartile split at the score of 84, and the upper quartile split at
the score of 114 (i.e., Q
1
= 54, Q
2
= 84, Q
3
= 114). Those
scores that fell within the lower quartile split were placed in
the low-willingness category, those scores that fell within the
middle quartile split were placed in the moderate-willingness
category, and those scores that fell within the upper quartile
split were placed in the high-willingness category. In other
words, 24 to 54 = low willingness, 55 to 113 = moderate
willingness, and 114 to 144 = high willingness.
The PSI total scale, however, ranges from a score of 32 to
a score of 192. Custer et al. (2001) informed that the PSI-
TECH scale scores are usually inversely related to the trait,
with high scores representing a reduced presence of a given
trait. For example, a high numerical overall PSI-TECH score
would indicate low levels of the self-appraised problem-
solving ability. In this study, the PSI scores were divided into
three categories using a quartile split. The lower quartile split
at the score of 72, the middle quartile split at the score of 112,
and the upper quartile split at the score of 152 (i.e., Q
1
= 72,
Q
2
= 112, Q
3
= 152). Following the suggestions of Custer
et al. (2001), those scores that were within the lower quartile
split were placed in the high self-appraised technological
problem-solving ability category, those scores that fell within
the upper quartile split were placed in the low self-appraised
technological problem-solving ability category, and those
scores that fell in the middle quartile split were placed in the
moderate self-appraised technological problem-solving abil-
ity category. The PSI scores were then indexed as follows: 32
to 72 = high self-appraised technological problem-solving
ability, 73 to 151 = moderate self-appraised technological
problem-solving ability, and 152 to 192 = low self-appraised
technological problem-solving ability.
Results and Discussion
The data collected and analyzed are presented in the order of
the research questions and the hypotheses.
Research Question 1: What is the extent of student teach-
ers' willingness to engage in troubleshooting activity?
Labe 5
The results in Table 1 indicate that student teachers in this
survey show a moderate willingness to engage in trouble-
shooting activities as their mean scores on the willingness
scale fall within the predefined middle quartile (M = 84.26,
SD = 12.94). Note that the willingness total scale score
ranges from 24 to 144. The willingness scores are indexed as
follows: 24 to 54 = low willingness, 55 to 113 = moderate
willingness, 114 to 144 = high willingness.
Research Question 2: To what extent do student teachers
appraise their technological problem-solving ability?
Data obtained from this study (see Table 1) show that the
student teachers appraised themselves as having moderate
technological problem-solving ability (M = 92.65, SD = 15.83).
Further analysis (see Table 1) indicated that the student
teachers showed moderate confidence (M = 28.13, SD = 7.82)
in themselves as technological problem solvers. They also
appraised themselves as capable of exercising moderate
control (M = 17.85, SD = 5.37) over themselves in the prob-
lem-solving situation. The results from this study indicate
that the student teachers showed a moderate tendency toward
approaching technological problems (M = 46.80, SD = 9.24).
Hypothesis 1: There is no significant relationship
between the student teachers' willingness to engage in
troubleshooting activity and their self-appraised techno-
logical problem-solving ability.
Results of a Pearson product-moment correlation (see
Table 2) indicated a statistically significant positive correla-
tion between the mean score of the student teachers' will-
ingness to engage in problem-solving activities and their
mean score for the self-appraised problem-solving ability
(r = -0.297, p = .000). Note that scores on the PSI are inversely
related to the trait. Thus, a negative correlation indicates a
positive relationship as higher PSI-TECH scores indicate
lower levels of the self-appraised problem-solving ability.
Hypothesis 2: No significant differences exist among the
student teachers in their willingness to engage in techno-
logical problem-solving activities on the basis of gender,
number of years spent in the university, and program of
study.
Results of a one-way ANOVA (see Table 3) indicated that
there are no significant differences at the p < .05 level among
the student teachers, on the basis of gender, in their willing-
ness to engage in troubleshooting activities, F(58, 251) =
1.156, p = .225. There were also no significant differences at
the p < .05 level among the student teachers from different
technical areas of specialization in their willingness to
engage in the troubleshooting activity, F(58, 251) = 1.309,
p = .083. Also, no significant differences were indicated at
the p < .05 level among the student teachers at different
levels of study (years of study) in their willingness to engage
in troubleshooting activities, F(58, 251) = 1.111, p = .289.

Hypothesis 3: Neither of the factors, technical area
of specialization, years of study, and gender, nor self-
appraised technological problem-solving ability is a sig-
nificant predictor of the student teachers' willingness to
engage in the troubleshooting activity.
To determine whether the willingness to engage in
problem-solving activities could be predicted from any of
the independent variables, multiple regression analysis was
performed. As this study is exploratory and we do not have
any strong theoretical forecast of the predictive power of any
of the independent variables over the other, a simultaneous
linear multiple regression analysis was done. The regression
model summary is shown in Table 4.
Table 4 shows that using the simultaneous multiple
regression method to examine the impact of the predictor
variables (technical area of specialization, years of study,
gender, and problem-solving self-appraised ability) on the
criterion variable (student teachers' willingness to engage
in troubleshooting activities) yielded a significant model,
F(4, 305) = 11.430, p = .00. The regressing model yielded an
adjusted R-square of 0.119. This indicates that only 11.90%
of the total variance in the student teachers' willingness to
engage in troubleshooting activities is accounted for by the
linear combination of these variables (technical area of
specialization, year of study, gender, and problem-solving
self-appraised ability).
The multiple regression model also tested the contribu-
tion of each predictor to the model. Table 5 also shows the
beta weights and t values to illustrate the contributions of
the separate factors to the prediction. The results obtained
from this study indicate that the student teachers' year of
study (B = 4.383, t = 2.751, p = .006) and self-appraised
problem-solving ability (B = -0.234, t = -5.346, p = .00)
made significant contribution to the prediction of the student
teachers' willingness to engage in technological problem-
solving activities. For every unit change in the student
teachers' year of study, we expect a 4.383 change in their
willingness to engage in troubleshooting activity, holding
the other predictors constant. For every unit change in the
student teachers' self-appraised problem-solving ability, we
expect a 0.234 change in their willingness to engage in trou-
bleshooting activities, holding the other predictors constant.

Discussion of Findings
The results of this study indicate that, the teacher trainees
surveyed in the universities reported a reasonable willing-
ness to engage in technical troubleshooting activities. This
finding appears contrary to the claim by Oyesiku (2008) and
others that graduates from Nigerian schools are generally not
willing to engage in technological problem-solving activities
such as troubleshooting and repairs. One curious observation,
however, that was made by this study is that these same
teacher trainees who reported a willingness to engage in
technical troubleshooting activities also indicated a slight
tendency toward avoiding technological problem-solving
situations in general as measured by the PSI. This finding
seems to contradict the respondents' self-appraisal of their
willingness to engage in troubleshooting activities as a sub-
set of technological problem solving. Individuals' problem-
solving approach­avoidance style (AAS) seems to be
particularly relevant to the construct of willingness to engage
in problem-solving activities. AAS is defined as a general
tendency to approach or avoid different problem-solving
activities (Heppner & Lee, 2002). Although willingness indi-
cates how much the individual wanted to engage in an activ-
ity (Adelman et al., 1990), a tendency to approach problems
is conceptualized to be especially critical in the initiation of
active problem solving (Heppner & Krauskopf, 1987). Thus,
it is curious why the students would indicate a willingness to
engage in technical troubleshooting, yet at the same time
report a tendency toward problem-solving avoidance. A
probable explanation is to remember that research and theory
have indicated work avoidance as a goal of some students in
academic achievement contexts.
Work avoidance has been defined as the desire to do as
little as possible in achievement situations (Brophy, 1983).
From the findings of this study, it might seem likely that in
non-achievement contexts too, some students might adopt
work avoidance goals. Students with work avoidance moti-
vation are said to be motivated to avoid doing their work
(assigned or unassigned, in-school or out of school) rather
than engage in it (Meece & Holt in Guthrie, Coddington, &
Wigfield, 2009). Dowson and McInerney (2001) informed
that students with work avoidance orientation may act as if
they are incompetent so that they will have an excuse to dis-
engage from the tasks.
In line with the general belief expressed in certain circles
(Abassah, 2011; Adedokun, 2011; Umunadi, 2011; Uwaifo,
2010; Uwaifo & Uwaifo, 2009), one would have expected
that the teacher trainees being students would express low
self-ability beliefs that in turn manifested in their apparent
reluctance to engage in technological problem-solving activ-
ities. However, the evidence from this study does not support
such speculation. The findings regarding self-capability
beliefs with respect to engaging in technological problem
solving indicate that the teacher trainees generally appraise
themselves as effective problem solvers. In addition, their
appraisal of own problem-solving ability is generally corre-
lated with self-reports of their willingness to engage in prob-
lem-solving activities.
The finding that the technological problem-solving self-
appraisal variable, as measured by the PSI-TECH, was a
significant predictor of willingness to engage in problem
activities also contrasts with the findings by MacPherson
(1998) where the technological problem-solving self-
appraisal variable, as measured by the PSI-TECH, was not
found to be a significant predictor of near-transfer technical
troubleshooting. The findings however are in line with
research on achievement motivation that established the
role of self-efficacy in individuals' activity choices and per-
formance (Eccles & Wigfield, 1995).
Part of the purposes of this study was to investigate
whether there were differences among the teacher trainees in
their willingness to engage in technological problem-solving
activities. More specifically, the study set out to learn whether
the willingness of university-level technology teachers in
training to engage in technological problem-solving activi-
ties differed by characteristics such as technical area of spe-
cialization, years of university experience, and/or gender.
Results of a one-way ANOVA indicated that there are no
significant differences at the p < .05 level on the basis of
gender, years of study, and the teacher trainees' technical
areas of specialization in their willingness to engage in trou-
bleshooting activities. However, the results of a simultane-
ous linear regression analysis indicated that gender was the

only non-statistically significant predictor of the teacher
trainees' technical area of specialization, and years of study
were indicated as statistically significant predictors of the
teacher trainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting
activities. A possible explanation for why the teacher train-
ees' areas of specialization could be used as significant pre-
dictors of their willingness to engage in troubleshooting
activities might perhaps be found within the differences in
how the features of the technological problem-solving
domain or activity (in this case technical troubleshooting)
line up with the students' prior knowledge and experience
(Brophy, 1999). It is possible that the students' prior experi-
ence in the sort of problems they are called on to solve might
perhaps be inadequate. Or perhaps some of the students'
prior experience with technological problem solving had
been unrewarding (Brophy, 1999). There is a need for further
research to examine these possibilities as they were not
explored in this study.
The results of a one-way ANOVA also indicated no sig-
nificant difference in the teacher trainees' willingness to
engage in problem-solving activities by year of study (years
of university experience). Nonetheless, the results of a simul-
taneous linear regression analysis indicated that the academic
year of study was a statistically significant predictor of the
teacher trainees' willingness to engage in troubleshooting
activities. This finding is in line with MacPherson (1998) who
found that years of experience were significantly related to
technical troubleshooting performance.
The results of a one-way ANOVA also indicated no statis-
tically significant difference between the male and female
teacher trainees in their mean score on willingness to engage
in problem-solving activities. In addition, gender was not
indicated as a statistically significant predictor of willingness
to engage in technological problem-solving activities. The
finding of this study concurs with those of Mokhtar (2000),
Effandi and Normah (2009), Hyde, Fennema, Ryan, Frost,
and Hopp (1990), Popoola (2002), and Mohd, Mahmood,
and Ismail (2011). These findings may perhaps be an indica-
tion that the gender gap is closing (Goold & Rimmer, 2000;
Rountree, Rountree, & Robins, 2002), perhaps because equal
attention is given to students, regardless of their gender
(Effandi & Normah, 2009).
Overall, though the research examined in this article
focuses on troubleshooting as a context for technological
problem solving, the findings have provided information that
enriches an understanding of the disposition of students in
Nigerian schools toward engaging in technological problem-
solving activities. In addition, the study serves as a valuable
contribution to the literature on the assessment of willing-
ness to engage in problem solving, especially given the
expectation that problem solving preparedness/willingness
research is likely to continue flourishing.
From the findings from this study, we conclude that there is
a need to critically appraise factors that influence individuals'
willingness to engage in problem solving and not rely on the
pedestrian view that students and even school graduates from
Nigerian schools are not ready to engage in problem solving.
Following the finding that the student teachers in the study
indicated problem-solving avoidance as measured by the
PSI, the researcher also recommends that whenever
educators observe reluctance among students, they should
endeavor to provide support by way of explanation, model-
ing, coaching, and other forms of assistance, and a suitable
environment that helps students develop self-esteem solving
technological problems.
