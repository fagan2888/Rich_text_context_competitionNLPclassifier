advertising reduce childhood obesity?

Background: There is evidence suggesting that food advertising causes childhood obesity. The strength
of this effect is unclear. To inform decisions on whether to restrict advertising opportunities, we
estimate how much of the childhood obesity prevalence is attributable to food advertising on television
(TV). Methods: We constructed a mathematical simulation model to estimate the potential effects
of reducing the exposure of 6- to 12-year-old US children to TV advertising for food on the prevalence
of overweight and obesity. Model input was based on body measurements from NHANES 2003­04, the
CDC-2000 cut-offs for weight categories, and literature that relates advertising to consumption levels
and consumption to body mass. In an additional analysis we use a Delphi study to obtain experts'
estimates of the effect of advertising on consumption. Results: Based on literature findings, the model
predicts that reducing the exposure to zero would decrease the average BMI by 0.38 kg/mÀ2 and lower
the prevalence of obesity from 17.8 to 15.2% (95% uncertainty interval 14.8­15.6) for boys and from
15.9% to 13.5% (13.1­13.8) for girls. When estimates are based on expert opinion, these values are
11.0% (7.7­14.0) and 9.9% (7.2­12.4), respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that from one
in seven up to one in three obese children in the USA might not have been obese in the absence of
advertising for unhealthy food on TV. Limiting the exposure of children to marketing of energy-dense
food could be part of a broader effort to make children's diets healthier.

Introduction
Childhood obesity rates are rising worldwide. This is
alarming because once gained, it is very difficult to get
rid of extra weight, and obesity is associated with an increased
risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, and with
a lower life expectancy.1,2
Though conclusive direct evidence is lacking, a wealth of
indirect evidence suggests that food advertising causes weight
gain in children.3­5 The overwhelming majority of food-
product advertisements seen on television (TV) by American
children and adolescents are for food of poor nutritional value
but high in energy content.6 Food promotion is having an
effect, particularly on children's preferences, purchase behav-
iour and consumption. This effect is independent of other
factors and operates at both a brand and category level.3
It seems unlikely that a change in consumption towards
energy-dense foods would not have any effect on body mass.
The real question is no longer whether food advertising
causes childhood obesity, but rather how much. Is its impact
negligible, as industry representatives argue, or considerable,
as health and consumer organizations estimate?7,8
A recent study shows that US children aged 2­11 years see
an average of 11.5 min of food-related TV advertising per day.9
How much of the overweight and obesity among US children
this explains is unknown and this implies that the potential
effectiveness of restrictions on the marketing of energy-dense
food to children is not known, either. We aim to give a
quantified estimate of the impact of TV food advertising on
childhood overweight and obesity.
The effect of advertising is difficult to examine directly.
Trials in life-like situations are virtually impossible, and
observational studies are complicated by a number of known
and suspected confounders. Both exposure to TV food
advertising and obesity are highly correlated with time spent
watching TV, permissive parenting styles and exposure to
other kinds of marketing. No study provides all the required
information but elements of the pathway from advertising
to overweight and obesity are known. Mathematical models
can be used to bring this information together in a logical
framework to derive effect estimates of interventions.10,11
Data from the published literature was used in a
mathematical simulation model of the relationship between
exposure to food advertising on TV and the prevalence of
childhood overweight and obesity. In this article, we explore
the potential effects of a total ban on TV food advertising on
6- to12-year-old children in the USA.
Methods
The model compares two populations: a reference population
that remains unchanged, and an intervention population in
which changes in exposure to food advertising are translated
into corresponding changes in consumption, body mass (BMI,
in kg/mÀ2) and the prevalence of overweight.
Our analytical framework consists of four steps. First, an
intervention or policy lowers exposure to food commercials.
At most, the exposure can be reduced to zero, and this is
the scenario we present. This is not a realistic scenario, but
it indicates the theoretical maximum effect of measures that
aim to limit children's exposure.
Second, a change in exposure lowers total daily energy
consumption [see Equation (1) in the Appendix 1]. We first

searched the literature for studies that quantified the effect
of advertising on body weight in a realistic setting, but
found none. We then decided on total energy intake as an
intermediate outcome measure and found only a single
suitable study. Based on cross-sectional data and a structural
equation model Bolton estimates that an increase in TV food
advertising exposure by an additional 25 min/week would
cause a child to consume one additional snack per week,
which would increase the child's energy intake by $1.4%.12
Hastings et al.3 describe the study as a complex, high-quality
study which found a small but significant association between
TV viewing and frequency of snacking. In a separate analysis,
we replaced this value with one based on current expert
opinion, as described below.
Third, lower consumption leads to a lower average body
weight [see Equations (2) and (3) in the Appendix 1]. For this
step, we applied the results of a study by Swinburn and
colleagues13. They analysed cross-sectional data in which total
energy expenditure is precisely measured and assumed to
be equal to total energy intake (`EnFlux'), and validated the
outcomes with longitudinal data. The study showed that a
higher total energy expenditure is associated with a higher
body mass; the authors estimate that two populations with
a 10% difference in mean EnFlux would have a 4.5% (95%
confidence interval: 3.8­5.1%) difference in mean weight.
Finally, we applied Rose's theorem that the mean predicts
the number of deviant individuals14 and assumed that the
average BMI predicts the number of overweight and obese. The
development of the obesity epidemic can be conceptualized
as a shifting population distribution of BMI.11 Over the years,
the BMI-curve has shifted to higher values with increased skew
to the right (figure 1).15 This is reflected in the mean BMI,
which has also steadily increased.16 We fitted the measured
BMI-data of the NHANES 2003­04 study, using the proper
sample weights, to a lognormal curve using the least squares
method.17 To mimic the historic changes observed in the
data, we fixed the lower end of the BMI-distribution in the
intervention population. This is consistent with the data
and theoretically plausible: below a certain BMI level, no life
is possible. We modelled boys and girls separately in 1-year
age categories. Children with a BMI between the 85th and
95th percentiles of US reference populations are categorized
as overweight, and those above the 95th percentile as
obese.18,19 Because these definitions are based on age by
month, we used the mid-year values. The entire BMI
distribution can be manipulated by changing its mean value.
Shifting the average upwards increases the variance and the
rightward skew, which pushes a higher proportion of the
population above the 85th and 95th percentile thresholds.
The model was implemented in a spreadsheet (MS Excel).
Delphi study
The uncertainty in the above calculation was considerable,
particularly in the dose­response relationship between TV
advertising and total energy intake. It is based on a single study
that was published in 1983 and did not quantify uncertainty.
In view of this paucity of evidence, we decided to obtain
current expert opinion and conducted a Delphi study to
estimate the impact of advertising on consumption.20 We
invited 33 academic experts to complete online questionnaires.
Twenty-five were selected via PubMed because of recent
publications on the subject, and eight were known by the
authors to have expertise on the subject. After briefly
presenting the Bolton study we asked for a lower and higher
boundary, and for a central estimate of the effect. We used
the latter in this analysis.
Uncertainty analysis
The two parameters with the greatest uncertainty are the
link from advertising to energy intake and the link from energy
intake to BMI. To reflect their potential impact, we calculated
95% uncertainty intervals around the outcomes. We used
a parametric bootstrap for the link between the amount
of energy consumed and body mass, assuming a normal
distribution.13,21 Since the Bolton study did not present
confidence limits, we could not incorporate the uncertainty
arising from the relation between advertising and energy
intake in our base case scenario. In the scenario based on the
Delphi study, we used a non-parametric bootstrap on the
central estimates of the experts to model the dose­response
relationship between exposure to advertising and energy
intake. For all bootstraps, we used the Ersatz programme
(Barendregt JJ, Brisbane 2007) and 5000 iterations.
Results
The base case model predicts that reducing the exposure to
TV food advertising of US children from 80.5 min/week9 to
zero would decrease total consumption by 4.5%. If every 10%
reduction in consumption corresponds to a 4.5% lower body
weight, children would weigh about 2.1% less than in the
current situation, on average. This translates to a reduction in
mean BMI of 0.38 kg mÀ2, and a decrease in the prevalence
of obesity by 2.7 (95% uncertainty interval 2.3­3.1) percent-
point for boys and 2.4 (2.1­2.8) for girls. The proportion of
children with overweight would also decrease (table 1).
Of the 33 experts invited to join the Delphi study, eight
completed the two rounds of questions (24% response). When
asked for a most likely value, the panel estimated that reducing
the exposure of children to food advertising on TV by
10 min/week would reduce the total energy intake by 1.4%
(95% uncertainty interval: 0.8­2.1). Using the experts'

exposure of US children to zero would result in a 12% decrease
in total consumption, a lowering of weight by 5.6% and
mean BMI by 1 kg mÀ2 and a reduction in the prevalence
of obesity by 6.8 (3.9­10.1) percent-point for boys and 6.0
(3.5­8.7) for girls. The proportion of children with overweight
would be reduced with 4.0% (2.0­6.6) and 4.6% (2.4­7.4),
respectively (table 1).
Discussion
A complete ban on food advertising on TV may reduce
the prevalence of obesity among US children by about 2.5
percentage points. Based on expert opinion, this could be
as much as 6.5 percentage points. In other words, given a
baseline prevalence of about 17%, possibly as many as one
in seven--or even one in three--obese children would not
have been obese in the absence of food advertising on TV.
Comparable numbers of overweight children might have had
a normal weight.
Limitations
The uncertainty in the size of these effects is considerable and
reflects the paucity of quantified data in this field of inquiry.
The most uncertain factor in our model is the dose­response
relation between advertising and total energy intake. We based
our estimate of the number of calories/day that is attributable
to TV food advertising on the Bolton study and, in a separate
analysis, on expert opinion obtained with the Delphi method.
The Bolton study is rather old and based on cross-sectional
data. The effect of advertising may be confounded with
`snacking-while-watching', because the time children were
exposed to TV advertising was not adjusted for the time spent
watching TV. On the other hand, the study may underestimate
the effect of commercials because it corrects for parental
influence. This assumes parents are not influenced by
advertising, but longstanding exposure to advertising may
have shifted parents' idea of what constitutes a `normal' diet
for children, even if there is no evidence of an influence on
their understanding of a healthy diet.3 The Delphi study had
a rather low response of 24% and self-selection bias cannot
be excluded. This bias would probably lead to overestimation
of the effects of restrictions on advertising, since people who
are passionate about the subject will be more likely to respond.
The respondents found the questions difficult to answer. The
resulting effect estimate is more than twice the Bolton effect
estimate, which was justified by referring to (indirect) evidence
from other studies, perceived limitations of the Bolton study
and the notion that marketing is probably more effective
now than it was in 1977 when the Bolton data were collected.
The model itself also has its limitations. The modelled
prevalence of obesity is about 1.4% lower than that reported by
the CDC,22 though our value falls within their 95% confidence
range. This may result from a less than ideal fit of our
lognormal curve to children's BMI and from the use of mid-
year cut-off points for overweight and obesity, rather than the
monthly values. As did Bolton, our model assumes that the
relationship between advertising exposure and consumption
is linear. This may not be accurate, but since we only estimate
the mean effect this is unlikely to lead to significant bias.
Other studies
Few studies give a quantified estimate of the effect of food
advertising on childhood obesity, or of the effectiveness
of measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising.
In an ecological study, Lobstein and Dibb5 conclude that
advertising could explain up to half of the variation between
countries' overweight prevalence figures. This suggests a larger
effect than we found. Possibly their exposure parameter, the
number of obesogenic advertisements per hour, acts as proxy
for marketing pressure more in general and the attitude of
the public (including parents) towards advertising. A recent
econometric study estimates that a ban on TV advertising
for fast food would reduce the number of overweight children
ages 3­11 years in the USA by 18%,23 which falls between our
high- and low-estimates and suggests an effect for all energy-
dense foods that is in the higher ranges of our results.
An Australian study estimates that reductions in TV food
advertising may lower mean BMI by 0.17 kg/mÀ2 which
is about half to a quarter of the effect we find for a total
ban.24 A strong point is that this effect is based on a
randomized controlled trial,25 but the setting of a summer
camp makes extrapolating to total consumption during
ordinary life difficult.
Although few other studies estimate the magnitude of
the effect of food advertising, TV watching as such has been
firmly linked to obesity. In a 4-year longitudinal study Dietz
and Gortmaker found a dose­response relationship of about
0.6% increase in obesity prevalence per extra hour of TV, after
correcting for past obesity and several socio-economic
characteristics.26 In a later study they conclude that more
than 60% of overweight incidence in a representative sample
of US children could be linked to excess TV viewing time.27
Robinson et al. conducted an experiment that reduced the
time 9-year-old children spent watching TV from about
15­9 h/week. After 7 months the BMI of the intervention
group was 0.45 lower than that of the control group.28 The
mechanism by which TV viewing causes weight gain remains
less clear. Besides the influence of advertising, two more
pathways have been postulated: the sedentary nature of
watching TV and a tendency to snack while watching TV.
A recent randomized controlled trial by Epstein at al showed
that reducing time spent watching TV or using a computer
resulted in a decrease in energy intake, while physical activity
levels (measured by accelerometer) remained largely unaf-
fected.29 This contradicts the widely held belief that physical
inactivity explains most of the link between TV viewing and
obesity, but does not indicate whether the culprit is advertising
or `snacking-while-watching'. A rough estimate shows that
in the Epstein study, a 70% reduction of TV and computer
time was associated with a decrease in net energy intake
of 10%. In comparison, our model predicts that a similar
reduction in TV advertising exposure may decrease consump-
tion by about 3­8%, an estimate that remains under the
ceiling implied by the Epstein study.

Strengthening the evidence base
The best design to obtain more accurate estimates of the
effect of TV food advertising on childhood obesity would
probably be a randomized controlled trial that reduces TV
exposure, distinguishes between exposure to advertising
and time spent watching TV and also measures physical
activity (using accelerometers). Such a study is technically
difficult, though in some settings it might be possible to
randomize access to channels with a high density of
advertising. Given the low feasibility of intervention studies,
carefully designed longitudinal and cross-sectional observa-
tional studies could make very useful contributions to this
field. More quantitative evidence on the effect of marketing on
childhood obesity might strengthen the case for policy
measures that limit (commercial) freedom and go against
powerful vested interests. However, given the complexities
of this field of research, the ultimate proof is unlikely to
be attainable.
Policy options
The present study suggests that if food advertising on TV
were banned, significant reductions in the prevalence of
childhood obesity are possible. Reducing marketing of
energy-dense foods via any channel might have an even
greater effect. A study into the effect of tobacco advertising
concluded that a comprehensive set of advertising bans can
reduce tobacco consumption but that a limited set of
advertising bans will have little or no effect.30 This might be
true for food advertising as well. If only TV advertising were
restricted, marketing budgets might not be reduced in size, but
instead used to deliver the same message via different media.
For example, the internet opens new ways to reach children
with marketing messages (e.g. via `advergaming'). Therefore,
even though exposure to TV advertising seems to have
stabilized in the US,9 the total commercial pressure on
children's diets is likely to be increasing. Around the year
2000 about 75% of the marketing budgets for food and drink
in European countries were spent on TV advertising, but the
market share of TV seems to be diminishing.8 However, it
seems unlikely that the use of other marketing channels would
fully compensate the loss of TV as an advertising medium.
Marketers use a mix of strategies and media to influence their
target audience, and it seems reasonable to assume that if the
opportunities to reach children diminish, some of its power
will be lost.
How much evidence justifies action will always be a matter
of judgment.31 In view of the likely costs of inaction, many
obesity experts would argue that the scientific evidence is
strong enough to proceed to action.3,19 The International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) recently formulated the `Sydney
Principles', which call for statutory actions to reduce market-
ing to children.32 The American Academy of Paediatrics
advocates a ban on junk-food advertising during program-
ming that is viewed predominantly by young children.33
Several countries (Sweden, Norway, Greece and the province
of Quebec) have already restricted advertising to children.
In conclusion, a considerable proportion of overweight
children in the USA might have had a normal weight in
the absence of advertising for unhealthy food on TV.
Though more comprehensive measures are likely to be more
effective, restrictions on TV food advertising may reduce
the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children.
Limiting the advertising of energy-dense foods could well
be an element in a broader effort to make children's diets
healthier.

Key points
 There is evidence to suggest that advertising for
energy-dense food increases children's' body mass
index, but it is not well-know how much advertising
contributes to the prevalence of childhood obesity.
 This study uses data from various sources in a logical
framework to quantify the effect of TV food advertis-
ing on childhood obesity in the USA, 2003.
 TV food advertising may be responsible for 15­40% of
the obesity prevalence among 6- to 12-year-old US
children, with a wide margin of uncertainty.
 Limiting the advertising of high-calorie foods could
well be an element in a broader effort to make
children's diets healthier.
