` (1820­1892) published a method of optically superimposing
images using an angled piece of colored glass. He showed that if one looks at a black, filled
circle through the colored glass and superimposes on it the reflection from the glass of
something white, the filled circle looks tinted with the complementary color of the background:
simultaneous color contrast or contrast color. Although Ragona-Scina
`'s method and his observation
have been cited into the 21st century, the former for its simplicity and the latter for its challenges
to early theories of color vision, some errors have crept in and the phenomenon still lacks an
agreed-on explanation. We provide some biographical information about Ragona-Scina

Introduction
Ragona-Scina
` (1847b) showed that if one looks at a black, filled circle through a colored
piece of glass, and then optically superimposes white light on it, by reflection from the front
surface of the glass, the filled circle looks tinted with the complementary color of the glass, a
phenomenon now known as simultaneous color contrast (e.g., Ekroll & Faul, 2013) or
contrast color (e.g., Whittle, 2003). As we will show, Ragona-Scina
` 's observation
challenged early theories of color vision and his method for producing it was new for most
vision researchers.
For both his observation and method, Ragona-Scina
` 's paper was widely cited up to
around the end of the 19th century, and more sporadically after that. Mausfeld (2003),
who made the most recent citation of Ragona-Scina
` we have found, observed that
contrast colors ``are actually still in want of a satisfactory explanation'' (p. 415), a
conclusion echoed by Mollon (2006) and by MacLeod (2010). To our knowledge, no
translation into English exists of Ragona-Scina
` (1847b), which was written in (rather
difficult!) Italian. Here, we give some biographical information about Ragona-Scina
` , set
the paper into its historical and theoretical context, and provide a translation of Ragona-
Scina
` 's (1847) paper into English.
Who Was Ragona-Scina
`?
Ragona-Scina
` changed his name in his published papers to Ragona by 1848. We refer to him
in this paper as Ragona-Scina
` .
Domenico Ragona-Scina
` (Figure 1) was born in Palermo on January 20, 1820 and died on
February 25, 1892 in Modena (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica (ING), 2000). During his
youth, Ragona-Scina
` was close to his maternal uncle, Domenico Scina
` (1765­1837;
Working Group for the History of Astronomy (WGHA), 1999), an eminent physicist,
mathematician, and historian (Alberti, n.d.). Scina
` guided Ragona-Scina
` into a scientific
career, tutoring him for the last few years of his own life (WGHA).
In 1844, Ragona-Scina
` received an undergraduate degree in mathematics and physics from
the Royal University of Palermo (Sicily), becoming the third assistant at the Royal
Observatory of Palermo (ING). In the same year, he was appointed as an adjunct
professor in Physics at the Athenaeum in Palermo, elevating him to second assistant at the
Observatory.
It is tempting to suppose that Ragona-Scina
` added the Scina
` part to his family name some
time prior to 1847 to honor his uncle, but then returned to his family name, Ragona, when he
felt he had discharged his educational and intellectual debt.
In 1850, Ragona-Scina
` became director of the Palermo Observatory for 10 years. During
his tenure, he brought the astronomical equipment of the observatory up to the cutting edge
(Osservatorio astronomico di Palermo, 2015). In 1863, Ragona-Scina
` became director of the
Astronomical Observatory in Modena (ING), where he dedicated himself to meteorology
and seismology, and similarly upgraded the extant apparatus for studying meteorology
(Calanca, 2003). Ragona-Scina
` was also partly responsible for founding the Italian
Meteorological Society in 1876 (ING).
Although Ragona-Scina
` published extensively in astronomy, meteorology, and seismology
(ING), our interests are in his contributions to the methods and findings of visual perception.
He wrote two papers in 1847 (Ragona-Scina
` , 1847a, 1847b), one in 1859 (Ragona, 1859) and
one in 1873 (Ragona, 1873), all on color vision. His method anticipated that in vision
research of using angled glass for optical superimposition, which found its full flowering
2 i-Perception
with multi-field tachistoscopes. These were popular in vision research from about 1910 to
about the 1970s when they were largely supplanted by oscilloscopes and then computer
monitors (Wade & Heller, 1997).
What Was Ragona-Scina
`'s Method and What Was His Observation?
Ragona-Scina
` 's (1847b) method was to look through a colored sheet of glass tilted about 45
to a horizontal line of sight at a black, filled circle drawn on a vertical white sheet of paper
while at the same time seeing the reflection, from the front surface of the glass, of a similar
horizontal white sheet of paper with its own black, filled circle. For example, when Ragona-
Scina
` used green glass, he saw the black, filled circle on the vertical piece of paper tinted with
red. The black, filled circle reflected from the horizontal piece of paper, visible near to, but
not superimposed on, the filled circle seen through the glass, was tinted with green, because it
is a mixture of black and green (Ragona, 1859). Ragona-Scina
` (1847b) considered it
remarkable that he could perceive red in the filled circle viewed through the glass when the
only light his eyes were receiving from that filled circle was green and white.
Ragona-Scina
` (1847a) also described another study in which he achieved the same results
by using a crystal of Island spar--a bi-refringent, polarizing material--to achieve optical
superimposition. Ragona-Scina
` (1859) reviewed both 1847 studies, recognizing that the
complementary colors he was perceiving were a phenomenon of perception, referring to
them as ``subjective colors'' (p. 1). Moreover, he gave an explanation of the subjective
colors that seems substantially acceptable today: The background of green plus white sets

` (Chinnici, 2013).
O'Shea et al. 3
a general adaptation level so that an area missing green appears red (p. 3). Ragona (1873)
emphasized that the reflected circle does not need to be present to experience the
phenomenon and that its explanation involves processes similar to those producing
complementary-color afterimages.
What Was the Context of Ragona-Scina
`'s Method?
The basic method Ragona-Scina
` (1847b) used to superimpose two images had already been
set forth by Giambattista della Porta in 1558 (see Porta, 1658). It was to use a piece of glass to
reflect an image of an object into the eyes of someone who was also looking directly, through
the piece of glass, at some other object. This technique began to be used in the middle of the
19th century in theatres in England to project ghosts--actually reflections from a large,
angled, piece of glass of actors portraying ghosts in a side room to the stage--onto the
main scene on the stage (Pepper's ghost, 2015).
Interest in color contrast, particularly in Germany, was stimulated by the observations of
Goethe (1810) on colored shadows. For example, Brandes (1827) used glass sheets to
combine different colored patches by reflection and transmission, as did Osann (1833,
1836) and Dove (1838); Osann (1836) and Dove also used coloured glass through which
patches could be observed. We have no evidence that Ragona-Scina
` was aware of their
work because he does not cite them. It seems common in science that academic credit does
not necessarily go to the originator of an idea, either by accident (Merton, 1968; Stigler, 1980)
or by design (Wike, 1973).
Helmholtz (1867, p. 405) provided a beautiful engraving (his Figure 151, our Figure 2)
depicting Ragona-Scina
` 's ``apparatus.'' Helmholtz's figure is incorrect in one minor aspect
and rather misleading in another. The minor error is that Helmholtz showed the eye above
the horizontal paper, looking down, instead of to the right, say, of the vertical paper. Of
course this modification will work perfectly well if perhaps not so conveniently for an
observer. Rood (1879, pp. 257­260), Tscherning (1898, p. 220), Hurst and Stocks (1916),
Ostwald (1919), Allen (1924), Linksz (1952), Graham and Brown (1965, p. 462), Geldard
(1972, p. 145), Hurvich (1981, p. 153), and Da Pos (1999, p. 587, Table 14) included figures
similar to Helmholtz's.
Helmholtz's (1867) and similar figures are misleading because they imply that Ragona-
Scina
` (1847b) had an actual apparatus, with a piece of glass at exactly 45, allowing very
careful positioning of the black, filled circles, whereas there is no such evidence of that in
Ragona-Scina
` (1847b). Ragona (1859) did later construct an apparatus, but it bore no
resemblance to the one depicted by Helmholtz or to the arrangement Ragona-Scina
`
described in 1847. The 1859 apparatus had both filled circles drawn on a single horizontal
sheet with the glass held in a clamp in front of a viewing tube and relied on reflections from
the front and rear surfaces of the glass, a technique used by Brandes (1827) and Dove (1838).
As will be evident in our translation, it seems to us that Ragona-Scina
` simply held the glass in
one hand and tilted it manually.
Ragona-Scina
` (1873) did finally build an apparatus similar to that illustrated by
Helmholtz (1867) and used it to superimpose transmitted contrast colors in very close
proximity to reflected colors, but mainly for the beauty the combined images offered viewers.
Hering (1887) also built an apparatus to provide the horizontal and vertical surfaces, and
slotted in the colored glass at 45. He replaced the black, filled circles by concentric rings of
black and white. The vertical image had the opposite arrangement of blacks and whites from
that of the horizontal. This does presuppose accurate construction of the apparatus and of
the images, and very careful positioning of the images to ensure that the blacks of one are
4 i-Perception
optically superimposed on the whites of the other and vice versa, similar to that achieved by
Ragona-Scina
` (1873). Sanford (1892, pp. 406­407) illustrated this sort of apparatus in a
figure (p. 406). This sort of precision anticipates the optical arrangement of multi-field
tachistoscopes. These were invented by Dodge (1907), who replaced the colored glass with
smoked glass.
Other citations of Ragona-Scina
` 's method include Oliver (1885), Axenfeld (1889) who
proposed an improvement of the method using transmitted light, Breese (1899) who
suggested the method could be used for optically superimposing images to produce
monocular rivalry, Rivers (1900, p. 1064), Greenwood (1910, p, 204), Hayes (1911), who
alluded to Hering's development of the method for assessing color blindness, and Parsons
(1915).
What Was the Context of Ragona-Scina
`'s Observation?
Good reviews of the history of other examples of simultaneous color contrast exist including
by Helmholtz (1867) and by Mollon (2006). Helmholtz pointed out that Leonardo da Vinci,
Figure 2. Helmholtz's (1867, p. 405) representation of Ragona-Scina
`'s method. Here is Southall's translation
of Helmholtz's description of the figure, ``ab and ac are two white paper surfaces, one horizontal, the other
vertical; and ad is a colored plate of glass inclined to the two paper surfaces at 45; e and f are two black
spots. An observer at B, looking down on the apparatus from above, sees the surface ab through the colored
glass, and the surface ac reflected in it. The image of ac coincides apparently with ab, and the image of the
black spot f is at g, say, not far from the spot e.'' (Helmholtz, 1924, p. 283).
O'Shea et al. 5
in 1519, was already familiar with the phenomenon in painting. Mollon attributed the first
report of complementary colored shadows to von Guericke (1672); Helmholtz cited Rumford
(Thompson, 1794) and Goethe (1810) for them. Mollon (2006) credited the first observation
of contrast colors to Jean-Baptiste Meusnier, who reported it to Monge (1789; for a
translation, see Kuehni, 1997). Helmholtz said that contrast color was carefully studied by
Chevreul (1839) in fabrics, that Dove (1838) observed it with colored glass on metal mirrors,
and that Meyer (1855) observed it with colored papers.
Helmholtz (1867) and later authors all accepted the validity of Ragona-Scina
` 's (1847b)
observation, presumably because they were able to make it themselves, as were we.
In present day visual science, we would say that the region of the retina from which one
sees the color complementary to the background receives no preponderance of light
consisting of wavelengths that would ordinarily appear as the complementarily color. For
example, a black, filled circle seen through a green glass does not deliver any long-wavelength
light to the retina where the filled circle projects. Nor does the optically superimposed white
light present any preponderance of long-wavelength light. So Ragona-Scina
` 's (1847b)
observation was a challenge to theories of color vision such as Young's (1804) that color
is a consequence of wavelength of light.
Mollon (2006) reported that Monge (1789) developed a surprisingly modern theory of
color vision, in which colors arise from the ratios of some then-unknown property of light
from differently colored objects in a scene, and that the observer has to make some judgment
of the properties of the illumination. This theory was designed to account for four key
observations of color vision:
(1) That a red object looks white when looked at through a red glass.
(2) That a white object looks white when looked at through a red glass.
(3) That colored shadows exist.
(4) That simultaneous color contrast exists.
Again, in present day visual science, we would say Monge proposed that the brightest area
in a scene appears white, even if it is contains a preponderance of a particular range of
wavelength, say long wavelengths that ordinarily appear red. Other areas containing a
balance of all visible wavelengths, which ordinarily appear white must shift their color in a
direction complementary to white to maintain the same ratios with it. Monge's emphasis on
ratios anticipated later theories such as Land's retinex theory (e.g., Land, 1977).
Helmholtz (1867) was unaware of Monge's theory and developed his own. He proposed a
physiological explanation residing in the retina and a higher-level psychological explanation.
The physiological explanation is now known as trichromatic theory, involving ratios of
activities among three receptors in the eye; it does not require any inference, conscious, or
unconscious (Hurvich & Jameson, 1969). Helmholtz (1867) conceded that trichromatic
theory was unable to explain Ragona-Scina
` 's (1847b) observation or other examples of
simultaneous color contrast (see later). The psychological explanation is known as
unconscious inference, or to use Helmholtz's words, an error, or an illusion. For example,
he proposed that the green background suggests to the observer that the spot is illuminated
by greenish light. Under such an illuminant, Helmholtz said, the observer makes the
unconscious inference that a dark greenish spot must have arisen from a dark pink spot
and that is what is perceived. This sort of thinking anticipates modern approaches to color
constancy (e.g., Foster, 2011) and the effects of experience and judgment on perception (e.g.,
Asch, 1956). It is certainly true that judgment plays a part in making any phenomenological
observation and its role is still a matter of debate (e.g., Gilchrist, 2015).
6 i-Perception
Hering (1887) reported a series of careful experiments addressing Helmholtz's explanation.
For example, he showed that the contrast colors are visible even when the observer is
unaware he is looking through colored glass. Hering (1890) also had observers look at a
dark spot on a white background with red glass over one eye and with blue glass over the
other. Although this yielded a purple background via binocular combination of colors, when
observers crossed their eyes, they saw two dark spots, one tinted with cyan and the other with
orange, thereby ruling out any unconscious inference from illumination, which should have
made the spots appear yellow.
Hering (1887) offered a physiological explanation of contrast colors involving reciprocal
inhibition between neighboring regions of the retina. This was a notion of almost uncanny
prescience, because the discovery of retinal ganglion cells having receptive fields responsive to
light and dark in center and surround regions (Kuffler, 1953) and the discovery of lateral
geniculate nucleus cells having receptive fields responsive to complementary colors in center
and surround regions (De Valois, Smith, Kitai, & Karoly, 1958) did not emerge until the
following century.
Any full explanation of the phenomenology of simultaneous color contrast will likely
involve a rapprochement between bottom-up, physiological explanations and top-down,
psychological explanations (MacLeod, 2010; Mollon, 2006).

LETTER OF PROF. DOMENICO RAGONA SCINA
`
TO MR. FILIPPO CIRELLI
DIRECTOR OF THE POLIGRAPHIC ESTABLISHMENT IN NAPLES
(Communicated by the author.)
Dear Mr. Cirelli.
I send a brief account of a pretty phenomenon I observed in the past few days, and of
which I cannot find any report by physicists.
Draw two, equal, black, filled circles on two, white pieces of paper, then arrange the two
papers at right angles, the first in a horizontal plane and the second in a vertical plane.
Look at the black circle of the vertical paper through a glass of any color. When the glass
is parallel to the vertical paper, the circle is seen perfectly black on a background of the
same color as the glass. Slightly tilting the glass, and placing its lower part closer to the
vertical card, and the upper part nearer to the eye, the circle continues to be black. But, by
tilting the glass more, at a certain point, the horizontal paper reflected on the glass is
projected onto the vertical paper. Then a sudden metamorphosis occurs, as the
transmitted circle of the vertical paper changes its black to a very distinct color
complementary to that of the glass. Simultaneously, the vertical paper, which was tinted
the same color as the glass, becomes white from the superimposed reflection of the card.
The reflected circle is always seen tinted the same color as the glass. That is, if the glass is
tilted so that the two circles, the reflected one and the transmitted one, appear aligned next
to each other on the opposite background, the reflected circle is seen as the same color as
the glass, and the transmitted circle as the complementary color, on a white background. If,
for example, a green glass is used, the reflected circle will be seen as green, and the
transmitted circle as red; if a blue glass is used, the reflected circle will be seen as blue,
and the transmitted circle as yellow, etc.
O'Shea et al. 7
Thus, a white surface transmitted by a colored glass coinciding in the same place with a
white reflected surface is seen as white; a black circle on a white background transmitted by a
colored glass coinciding with a white reflected surface is seen tinted with the color
complementary to that of the glass; a black circle on a white background reflected by a
colored glass coinciding with a transmitted white surface is seen tinted with the same color
as the glass. The experience can be produced in different ways, and it is always very enjoyable.
The complementary-colored circle has a beautiful appearance when light is shone onto the
transmitted paper from a conveniently located lamp. It brings wonder to note that these two
circles, the reflected one and the transmitted one, which fall next to each other on the
opposite backgrounds, have the same appearance, one (colored like the glass) and the
other (colored like the complementary color). I have been the first to observe the following
facts, part of which I have published the data, which can be verified by anyone, by moving a
colored glass under a large crystal of Iceland spar through which a black circle can be seen on
a white background.
1. In the superimposed, homologous images of the circle and glass, the circle is seen tinted
with the color complementary to that of the glass, against a white background.
2. When superimposing opposite images, the circle is seen tinted with the same color of the
glass against a white background.
3. When superimposing opposite images, the more intense the color of the glass, the blacker
the circle appears and the less it shares the color of the glass.
4. The more intense the glass, the weaker is the circle tinted with the complementary color in
the superimposed homologous images.
5. At a certain degree of intensity of the glass,1 in the coincidence of the homologous images,
the circle becomes completely invisible, that is, at a certain degree of intensity, the colored
glass acts completely as an opaque body would in similar circumstances.
6. This degree of intensity for the same circle is relative to the darkness of the color of the
glass, and for the same glass is relative to its distance from the paper bearing the circle, and to
the intensity of the latter.2
7. By moving a black piece of cardboard in the opposite direction from the colored glass, the
circle tinted with the complementary color in the white background becomes black on the
background of the same color of the glass; and when the intensity of the glass is such as to
render the circle totally invisible in the superimposition of the homologous images, the black
circle reappears completely distinct and equally black on the background colored like the
glass.
8. By moving not a black cardboard, but another colored glass in the opposite direction, a
circle tinted by the complementary color appears the same color as that of the second
glass, albeit not generally, but always within the intensity relationships between the two
glasses, relationships that produce in this case variable and beautiful appearances,
etc., etc.
Equally it is observed in the experience we are talking about, that the more intense the
glass, the weaker and duller is the transmitted circle tinted with the complementary color
of the reflected paper, and the darker is the reflected colored circle with the same color of the
transmitted paper; that at a certain degree of intensity of the glass the transmitted circle
disappears altogether when its color is the same of the reflected paper, while the reflected
circle is completely black; that moving a black cardboard onto the horizontal paper, the
complementary circle becomes black on the background of the same color of the glass, or
reappears when it was invisible: a very simple effect, because the black cardboard intercepts
the reflected paper that coincides with the transmitted one. There is perfect correspondence in
appearances arising from a colored glass, instead of a black cardboard. To give an idea of
8 i-Perception
this, I include the following table. The first column gives the color of the glass that moves
over the horizontal paper, the second column the tint that is assumed by this glass when seen
by its reflection and projected onto the transmitted paper (vertical), the third column the tint
that it is assumed by the transmitted circle when superimposed on the reflected,
complementary-colored paper and on this glass.
When keeping a green glass in front of the eye
Red . . . Green . . . Black
Orange . . . Yellow . . . Reddish purple
Blue . . . Green-blue . . . Dark blue.
When keeping a blue glass in front of the eye
Pale yellow . . . Reddish . . . Saturated yellow
Red . . . Saturated blue . . . Black
Green . . . Dark green . . . Pale green.
By moving these glasses under a large crystal of Iceland spar in the opposite direction, it
is observed that there is a full match of appearances. For example, if a green glass is moving
from the right to the left side, the image of the right side of the black circle will be seen as
green, and the left side as red; therefore, by moving an orange glass from the left side to the
right, the red image becomes purple, and the two images will be seen on a yellow
background.
In the experience I am talking about, the image tinted with the complementary color,
which in principle is easy to see, also becomes much weaker as the glass is tilted more, and
finally disappears at some tilt, depending on whether the glass is more or less intense. When it
has disappeared, it can be made to reappear by means of a black cardboard or of another
colored glass. This disappearance is perhaps dependent upon the intensity of the reflected
white surface onto which the transmitted circle is superimposed which becomes more
intense with the greater obliquity of superimposition. If you look at the transmitted
circle through a good bi-refringent prism, two circles tinted with the complementary
color of the glass can be seen; however, tilting the glass, they do not disappear
simultaneously, even when the main section of the prism is horizontal; but first one
disappears, and after a sufficient interval the other image disappears too. This interval
between the two disappearances perhaps depends on polarization by refraction, which
the transmitted circle assumes relative to the tilt.

Robert P. O'Shea studied psychology at the University of
Queensland. After five years of post-doctoral experience in
North America, he moved to University of Otago where he
worked on visual perception. In 2009 he moved to Southern
Cross University, where he established research in the cognitive
neuroscience of visual consciousness. In 2015, he moved to
Murdoch University where he continues his research in the
cognitive neuroscience. For more information, visit https://

Stefano Brini, In 2010, Stefano Brini moved to Perth (Western
Australia) to study psychology at Murdoch University. He
graduated with a Bachelor of Psychology with Honours in
2014 (ad with minors in health psychology and criminology).
In 2015, he began a joint PhD program in cognitive
neuroscience between the University of Turku (Finland) and
Murdoch University. His PhD research project explores the
effects of second language learning and physical exercise on
cognitive performance and related biomarkers in the
asymptomatic, preclinical stage of Alzheimer's Disease. His
academic interests also include evolutionary psychology and
statistics. For more information, visit https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefano_Brini or

Nicholas J. Wade, received his degree in psychology from the
University of Edinburgh and his Ph.D. from Monash
University, Australia. This was followed by a postdoctoral
fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung, at the
Max-Planck-Institute for Behavioural Physiology, Germany.
His subsequent academic career has been at Dundee
University, where he is now Emeritus Professor. His research
interests are in the history of vision research, binocular and
motion perception, and the interplay between visual science
and art. For more details, see http://www.dundee.ac.uk/
