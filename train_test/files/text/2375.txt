Abstract
Background: Breast and Cervical cancer are the two most common cancers among women in developing countries. Regular
screening is the most effective way of ensuring that these cancers are detected at early stages; however few studies have
assessed factors that predict cancer screening in developing countries.
Purpose: To assess the influence of household socio-economic status (SES), healthcare access and country level
characteristics on breast and cervical cancer screening among women in developing countries.
Methods: Women ages 18­69 years (cervical cancer screening) and 40­69 years (breast cancer screening) from 15
developing countries who participated in the 2003 World Health Survey provided data for this study. Household SES and
healthcare access was assessed based on self-reported survey responses. SAS survey procedures (SAS, Version 9.2) were
used to assess determinants of breast and cervical cancer screening in separate models.
Results: 4.1% of women ages 18­69 years had received cervical cancer screening in the past three years, while only 2.2% of
women ages 40­69 years had received breast cancer screening in the past 5 years in developing countries. Cancer screening
rates varied by country; cervical cancer screening ranged from 1.1% in Bangladesh to 57.6% in Congo and breast cancer
screening ranged from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo. Significant determinants of cancer screening were household SES, rural
residence, country health expenditure (as a percent of GDP) as well as healthcare access.
Discussion: A lot more needs to be done to improve screening rates for breast and cervical cancer in developing countries,
such as increasing health expenditure (especially in rural areas), applying the increased funds towards the provision of more,
better educated health providers as well as improved infrastructure.

Introduction
Cancer incidence and mortality rates have been declining in
developed, western nations due mainly to a reduction in risk
factors such as smoking and improved screening and treatment
regimens [1­5]. However, the opposite trend is being observed in
low-income countries; cancer incidence and mortality rates have
been increasing and are projected to increase at even faster rates
[6­10]. Of the 12 million incident cases and 8 million deaths due
to cancer worldwide in 2008, 53% of the new cases and 65% of
the deaths occurred in less developed countries [11]. There are
several suggested reasons for these increases including the rising
popularity of western lifestyle that includes smoking, lower
physical activity levels, lower reproduction rates and higher
calorie intake [7,12­16]. In addition, developing countries are
disproportionately affected by infectious agents that may cause
cancer such as the Human Papillomavirus (for cervical cancer), H.
Pylori (for stomach cancer) and Hepatitis B and C (for liver cancer)
[1,17].
The high cancer mortality rates can also be partly attributed to
lack of adequate health infrastructure and healthcare personnel in
developing counties [18­21]. One major approach to reducing
mortality rates involves improving access to cancer screening.
Breast and cervical cancer are the two most common cancers in
most low-income countries, accounting for 19% and 23% of all
cancers respectively [22­24]. Fortunately, adequate screening is
capable of identifying these cancers at early stages where treatment
regimens are effective, uncomplicated and cheaper [25]. Unfor-
tunately, cancer screening rates are very low in developing
countries; only 19% of women were screened for cervical cancer in
developing countries, compared with over 60% in developed
countries [26]. Also, less than 1% of women ages 25 to 64 years in
Bangladesh had received a Pap test in the past 3 years [27]. In
addition to lack of infrastructure and personnel, competing
healthcare crises in poor countries due to HIV/AIDS or infant

mortality may further complicate the receipt of adequate cancer
screening [11]. It is therefore very important to understand the
factors that affect cancer screening in order to develop programs to
make it easier for women to get screened in both rural and urban
areas.
Two recent studies have examined the impact of income
inequality on cervical cancer screening among countries that
participated in the WHS [26,27]. These studies contribute to
better understanding of the factors that impact screening. The
purpose of this study is to further explore determinants of breast
and cervical cancer screening among women, focusing on those
residing in low-income countries. Very little has been published so
far about the factors that affect cancer screening in low income
countries, and this may be due to the lack of quality survey data on
cancer screening. However, the World Health Survey provides a
unique opportunity to use high quality data collected in a
standardized format to examine specific factors such as SES and
access to healthcare that influence adequate breast and cervical
cancer screening. In addition, country level characteristics that
reflect the strength and quality of the public health infrastructure
such as health expenditure and under-5 mortality rates may also
predict screening and were assessed in this study. We hypothesize
that low socio-economic status and poor access to healthcare are
major predictors of cancer screening in low-income countries.
Methods
Data Sources and Analytic Samples
This study utilized data from the 2002­2003 World Health
Survey (WHS) conducted in 70 countries by the World Health
Organization. The details of the survey have been published
elsewhere [27,28] and is available online at http://www.who.int/
healthinfo/survey/en/. In brief, the WHS is a cross-sectional,
multistage cluster survey that utilizes a probability sampling design
in which every individual in the sampling frame has a known and
non-zero probability of being in the survey sample. Data from
each country was designed to be nationally representative of the
country's eligible population at the time of the survey. Eligible
survey participants were men and women ages 18 years and older
who were surveyed through private (where possible), face-to-face
interviews by survey interviewers [29]. The survey captured
information on demographics, health status, risk factors, health
system responsiveness, health expenditure and coverage, access
and utilization of health services. Information was collected at the
household and individual level. Survey materials were translated
into local languages where appropriate and reviewed according to
standard WHO protocol.
This analysis was restricted to WHS data from low income
countries. Low-income was defined according to the World Bank's
classification of countries based on the 2010 Gross National
Income (GNI) per capita. Based on this criterion, low-income
countries are those that have a GNI per capita of $1,005 or less.
Details of this categorization can be found at http://data.
worldbank.org/about/country-classifications. In addition, three
other country level characteristics were obtained from the World
Bank; total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, under-5
mortality rate per 1,000 and gross national income per capita.
Data from 15 low-income countries that participated in the
WHS were used in this analysis. The countries included are: Chad,
Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Comoros, Laos, Zimbabwe, Burkina
Faso, Nepal, Mauritania, Myanmar, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,
Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Data from Zambia was not included in
the analysis because only one cluster represented the entire
country which did not permit for analysis using valid survey
statistical methods. In addition, data from 2 strata in Nepal and
Kenya were dropped from the variance estimation process due to
missing data on demographic information. Survey sampling
analytic procedures was employed to account for clustering and
unequal probability of selection. The analytic dataset was
restricted to women ages 18 to 69 (30,509 women) for cervical
cancer screening and 40 to 69 (10,860 women) for breast cancer
screening. Questions about health care access were only asked of
respondents who had visited a healthcare facility for themselves or
their children in the past 12 months. Therefore, this analysis
focused on women in the specified age groups who had been to a
healthcare facility in the past 12 months. There were 10,021
women ages 18 to 69 and 4,009 women ages 40­69 that fulfilled
the study criteria.
Data Management
Cancer Screening. There were three questions in the WHS
addressing cancer screening, two about cervical cancer screening
asked of women ages 18 to 69 years, and one about mammog-
raphy use asked of women ages 40 to 69 years. 1. ``When was the
last time you had a pelvic examination, if ever? (By pelvic
examination, I mean when a doctor or nurse examined your
vagina and uterus?)''. 2. ``The last time you had the pelvic
examination, did you have a PAP smear test? (By PAP smear test, I
mean did a doctor or nurse use a swab or stick to wipe from inside
your vagina, take a sample and send it to a laboratory?)''. 3.
``When was the last time you had a mammography, if ever? (That
is, an xray of your breasts taken to detect breast cancer at an early
stage)''. For this analysis, cervical cancer screening was defined as
a pelvic examination with or without a pap test in the past 3 years
among women ages 18­69 years; while breast cancer screening
was defined as a mammography test in the past 5 years among
women ages 40­69 years.
Socio-Demographic Variables. Marital status was catego-
rized as single, married/cohabiting or divorced/separated/
widowed. Education level was categorized as primary school or
less, secondary school or college and higher. Employment was
categorized as government employee, self-employed or not
working for pay. Age was categorized as ,40 years, 40­60 years
and .60 years. Residence was categorized as rural or urban. All
variables are based on self-reports.
Socio-Economic Status. Permanent income indicators for
low-income countries were used to define socio-economic status
for survey respondents. Survey questions assessed ownership of a
range of assets from chairs, tables, ploughs and buckets to cars,
mobile phones, washing machines and refrigerators. Country-
specific items were also added to the list of permanent income
indicators to account for differences between countries. To create
a composite measure of socio-economic status, country-specific
principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using these
permanent income indicators. This approach has been used in
previous studies using data from low-income countries where
income and education variables are often inaccurate and not likely
to capture the full extent of an individual's socio-economic status
[30­33]. In brief, an SES score was calculated for each household
by weighting each income indicator by the coefficient of the first
principal component. All individuals present in the household
were assigned the same household SES score, and the score was
categorized into tertiles; poorest, middle and richest.
Access to Healthcare. Individual access to healthcare was
assessed in this study using questions related to health system
responsiveness in the WHS. There were four variables used to
define access to healthcare: 1. Last place visited in the past 12
months (e.g. government facility, private facility, NGO, or other);
Cancer Screening in Low-Income Countries

2. Last healthcare provider visited (e.g. medical doctor, nurse,
midwife, traditional practitioner, etc); 3. How long it took to get
there (in minutes); 4. Mode of transportation (e.g. private car,
public transportation, biking or walking).
Country Covariates. Country level healthcare infrastructure
characteristics were assessed using three variables obtained from
the World Bank; health expenditure as a percent of GDP, under-5
mortality, and the Gross National Income. Health expenditure as
a percent of GDP is a measure of public and private health
expenditure on preventive and curative health services. Under-five
mortality rate represents the probability per 1,000 that an infant
will die before age five if current age-specific mortality rates apply.
GNI per capita is a measure of the total value of all products and
services produced by the domestic economy of a country divided
by the population of the country, measured in US dollars.
Statistical Analysis
SAS statistical software (SAS, Version 9.2) was used for data
analysis. Survey analytic procedures were used to account for the
complex survey design. Sample weights that represent the
population of each specific country, and stratum codes that are
nested within each country based on the country's survey design
were incorporated into the analysis. Descriptive statistics were
generated using chi-square tests with the SURVEYFREQ
procedure in SAS. The outcome variables were dichotomized
into recent mammography screening or not and recent cervical
screening or not. SURVEYLOGISTIC procedures were used for

bivariate analysis and also for multivariable models. Two models
were developed for each outcome of interest; the first model
included socio-demographic, SES and healthcare access variables,
and the second included individual and country level covariates.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported; and a p-
value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. List-
wise deletion was used to deal with missing data. Data were
expected to be missing at random since the WHS was a
comprehensive survey designed to elicit responses to a wide range
of questions, so there was likely no correlation between missing
responses and our specific outcomes of interest.
Results
The majority of the women in the analytic sample (women who
had visited a healthcare facility in the past 12 months) were less
than 40 years old (60%), married (71%), had only a primary school
education or less (85%), were not currently working for pay (72%),
and 79% of the women resided in rural areas (Table 1). During
their last visit to a healthcare facility in the past year, most of the
women had visited an NGO or other type of healthcare provider
(36%), 35.7% had visited a government healthcare facility and
28% had visited a private healthcare facility. During the visit, 43%
had seen a medical doctor, 22% had seen a nurse/midwife, while
36% had seen a traditional health provider. The majority of the
women (82%) used public transportation to get to the facility, 15%
walked or biked while 2% used a private vehicle. Travel time to
the facility was less than 30 minutes for 67% of the women,
between 30 minutes to 1 hour for 17%, and over 1 hour for 16%.
Overall, 4.1% of women ages 18­69 years in developing
countries had received a pelvic exam or pap smear in the past
three years. There were wide variations in the prevalence of
cervical cancer screening by country, ranging from 1.1% in
Bangladesh to 57.6% in Congo (Figure 1). Among women ages
40­69, 2.2% had received a mammography exam in the past 5
years, ranging from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo.
Factors that significantly increased the likelihood of receiving a
pelvic exam or pap smear in the past 3 years among 18 to 69 year
old women included being younger than 60 years, having a
secondary school education or greater, and seeing a nurse/
midwife at the last health center visit (Table 1). Being single,
divorced or widowed, not currently employed, residing in a rural
area, residing in a low or middle SES household, visiting an NGO
clinic, seeing a traditional health practitioner and having to walk
or bike to the health center were variables significantly associated
with reduced likelihood of a pelvic exam or pap smear. Among
women ages 40 to 60 years old, having at least a secondary school
education and a travel time of less than 30 minutes to the health
center were associated with increased likelihood of receiving a
mammography exam in the past 5 years. Being currently
unemployed, residing in a rural, low or middle SES household,
seeing a traditional health practitioner and having to walk or bike
to the health center were significantly associated with reduced
likelihood of a mammography exam.
In multivariate analysis of pelvic exam or pap smear among 18
to 69 year old women, after adjusting for age, education,
employment and marital status, residing in the lowest SES
household was associated with a 43% reduction (OR = 0.57,
0.39­0.82) and residing in the middle SES household was
associated with a 33% reduction (OR = 0.66, 0.48­0.92) in the
likelihood of receiving a pelvic exam/pap smear (Table 2). In
addition, visiting an NGO instead of a government or private
clinic (OR = 0.33, 0.23­0.49) and residing in a rural area
(OR = 0.44, 0.32­0.60) were also associated with reduced likeli-
hood of receiving a pelvic exam/pap smear. After adjusting for
fixed effect of country covariates, these variables remained
statistically significant and their effects appeared to be even
stronger (Table 2). In addition, every unit increase in country
health expenditure (as a percent of GDP), increased the likelihood
of pelvic exam/pap smear by 50% (OR = 1.50, 1.30­1.73).
In multivariate analysis of mammography screening among
women ages 40 to 69, several two-way interaction terms were
found to be significant predictors (Table 3). First, among women
whose travel mode to a healthcare facility during their last visit was
by public transportation, residing in a middle SES household

compared with a high SES household was associated with reduced
likelihood of mammography screening (OR = 0.14, 0.04­0.50).
Secondly, among women residing in rural areas, belonging to a
middle SES household compared with high SES was also
associated with reduced likelihood of mammography screening
(OR = 0.14, 0.04­0.50). Among women residing in urban areas, a
similar but stronger reduction in the likelihood of screening was
also observed (OR = 0.01, 0.00­0.07). Thirdly, among women
residing in rural areas, a travel time of 30 minutes to 1 hour
compared with over one hour of travel was associated with a
significant increase in the likelihood of mammography screening
(OR = 3.25, 1.09­9.75). in contrast, among women residing in
urban areas, a travel time of 30 minutes to 1 hour compared with
over an hour of travel reduced the likelihood of mammography
screening (OR = 0.06, 0.00­0.72).
After adjusting for country level covariates including health
expenditure (as a % of GDP), under-5 mortality rate and GNI, a
significant association between type of healthcare facility and
mammography screening was observed (Table 3). Compared with
visiting a government run facility, private healthcare facilities
appeared to increase the likelihood of mammography screening
among women by twofold (OR = 2.00, 1.12­3.59). In addition,
women residing in middle or low SES households appeared to
have significantly lower likelihood of mammography screening
regardless of residence in a rural or urban area as well as mode of
transportation. The only country level covariate found to be a
significant predictor of mammography screening was under-5
mortality rate; there was a 2% increase in the likelihood of
receiving mammography for every unit increase in the under-5
mortality rate.
Discussion
This study focused on assessing the rates and determinants of
breast and cervical cancer screening among women residing in
developing countries. In order to assess the influence of health care
access on screening rates, this analysis was restricted to women
who had visited a healthcare clinic for themselves or their children
in the past year. Generally, screening rates were very low,
although there were wide variations between countries. Mam-
mography screening rates were very low in most countries, while
cervical cancer screening by pelvic examination and/or Pap smear
was more common. Other studies have reported these low
screening rates and wide variation by country previously
[26,27]. The low rates of mammography screening in this
population is not surprising given the extensive cost and advanced
infrastructure required to have systemic mammography facilities
and trained personnel. Many organizations such as the WHO do
not recommend routine mammography screening for poor

countries, focusing instead on Breast Self Examination which is a
cheaper option [34].
Several factors influence the actual receipt of breast and cervical
cancer screening in developing countries. The focus of this analysis
was on socio-economic status and healthcare access determinants
of screening. After adjusting for several important individual level
covariates such as age, education, employment and martial status,
belonging to the poorest SES household, living in a rural
community and visiting an NGO clinic (versus a government or
private run clinic) were significantly associated with lower
likelihood of receiving cervical cancer screening. There were no
significant associations between travel time and travel mode and
cervical cancer screening. After adjusting for country level
characteristics related to health expenditure, these same covariates
remained significant. In addition, country expenditure on health
(as % of GDP) had a very large impact on cervical cancer
screening. This suggests that irrespective of individual and
neighborhood factors, the government's investment in the health
infrastructure has the potential for significantly improving cancer
screening rates within a country. This aligns with other studies
which have generally shown that increased health expenditure
improves health outcomes [35,36]. Such investment could
influence screening rates through better equipments and trained
personnel in hospitals, or better outreach and education of women
about the importance of screening.
Although mammography screening rates were generally low,
there were significant differences in the likelihood of obtaining a
mammography test in the past 5 years based on SES, rural/urban
residence and travel time. The only country level covariate that
was significantly associated with mammography screening was the
under-5 mortality rate. It is possible that for developing countries,
the cost of having a functional mammography screening facility is
so prohibitively high that within limited budgets, even major
increases in health expenditure (as % of GDP) are inadequate.
While unintuitive, under-5 mortality rate may increase the
likelihood of receiving a mammography test through increased
contact with the healthcare system. It is possible that a high under-
5 mortality rate within the country may force women to have more
frequent contact with hospitals and healthcare personnel who may
also recommend health check-ups for the mothers including
potentially cancer screening.
This study is the first of its kind to assess the contribution of
SES, the health care system and country-level healthcare
expenditure on cancer screening in developing countries. Impor-

Cancer Screening in Low-Income Countries
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48834
tant factors that were associated with cancer screening include
SES; the poorer the household, the less likely it is to get screened.
This association has also been reported previously in different
populations [37­43]. This may be because low SES households
tend to be less educated and less likely to be aware of the benefits
of cancer screening or are likely to have negative perceptions
about screening. It is also likely that working low-paying, menial
jobs leaves little time or opportunity to participate in screening
programs. This analysis shows that the influence of SES on breast
cancer screening varies depending on rural/urban residence. For
instance, in urban areas, women belonging to middle SES
households have much lower odds of receiving a mammography
test compared with women belonging to middle SES households in
rural areas. This may be due to the lack of community resources,
and the higher cost of living in urban areas compared with rural
areas that provide less disposable income for urban middle SES
households to be spent on healthcare.
A major strength of this study is the assessment of socio-
economic and health system factors from developing countries
surveyed as part of the 2003 World Health Survey. The
standardized protocol and questionnaires allowed for the use of
data from several developing countries. Also, the use of PCA to
define household SES allowed for the inclusion of household assets
and did not rely only on income and education. This improves the
validity of the SES measure by accounting for differences in SES
between rural and urban areas, and between countries. In
addition, the availability of country level variables from the World
Bank allowed for the assessment of the impact of country
characteristics on cancer screening. Limitations of this analysis
include the survey nature of the responses which may be
vulnerable to recall bias on the part of the respondents. Also,
the health system characteristics assessed in this study was based
on the last healthcare facility attended in the past year. It is
possible that this is not representative of the facility that a woman
would normally attend for cancer screening.
In summary, cancer screening rates in developing countries are
generally very low. Unfortunately, there are large projected
increases in cancer rates in developing countries in the coming
decades due to the increasing westernization of lifestyle as well as
environmental factors. If we are to meet the challenge of the rising
cancer epidemic in these regions of the world, it will be very
important to understand the factors that inhibit and encourage
cancer screening in order to promote early detection. Some of
these barriers include factors related to healthcare access such as
availability and accessibility of healthcare facilities and healthcare
providers, as well as the lack of a comprehensive approach to
cancer prevention, screening and treatment on a national level. In
addition, some countries may require extra efforts aimed at
including men in cancer education programs about the necessity
for routine breast and cervical cancer screening for their women,
since in many cases their permission may be needed.
Developing countries face monumental challenges; ranging
from socio-economic to infrastructural and massive infectious
disease epidemics. However, these challenges must not detract
from the importance of understanding and addressing barriers to
proper cancer screening. Based on this analysis, improving the
quality and access to government run hospitals especially in rural
areas and increasing the government expenditure on health (as %
of GDP) appear to be ways by which cancer screening can be
improved.
