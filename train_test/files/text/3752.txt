Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a perplexing and pervasive developmental disorder characterized by social difficulties,
communicative deficits, and repetitive behavior. The increased rate of ASD diagnosis has raised questions concerning
the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of this disorder; meanwhile, the cause of ASD
remains unknown. This study surveyed mothers of ASD and non-ASD children to determine possible effects of labor and
delivery (L&D) drugs on the development of ASD. The survey was administered to mothers; however, the results were
analyzed by child, as the study focused on the development of autism. Furthermore, an independent ASD dataset from the
Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center was analyzed and compared. Indeed, L&D drugs are associated with ASD
(p ¼.039). Moreover, the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center dataset shows that the labor induction drug,
Pitocin, is significantly associated with ASD (p ¼.004). We also observed a synergistic effect between administrations of L&D
drugs and experiencing a birth complication, in which both obstetrics factors occurring together increased the likelihood of
the fetus developing ASD later in life (p ¼.0003). The present study shows the possible effects of L&D drugs, such as Pitocin
labor-inducing and analgesic drugs, on children and ASD.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive develop-
mental disorder ranging in severity, in which those diag-
nosed characteristically exhibit social difficulties,
communication differences, and rigid or repetitive behav-
ior (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Gregory
et al., 2013). The symptoms of ASD become apparent
in early childhood, at around 2 to 3 years of age, and
persist throughout an individual's lifespan (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). The terms ASD and
autism are used interchangeably in this article unless
stated otherwise.
Recent statistics on the prevalence of ASD indicate a
significantly increased rate of diagnosis over the past
decade, with 1 in 68 American children being diagnosed
with ASD in 2014 (Baio, 2014). While the increased diag-
nosis rate can be attributed in part to expansion of the
diagnostic criteria, such as the inclusion of Asperger
Syndrome in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders IV, as well as increased awareness

of ASD, increased exposure to environmental risk factors
may also increase the prevalence of ASD in some popu-
lations. There has been ongoing research to ascertain the
etiology of ASD; it is generally acknowledged that autism
has a genetic basis, based on the evidence of a high level
of heritability and high concordance rates in monozygotic
versus dizygotic twins (Ronald et al., 2006; Hallmayer
et al., 2011). However, this genetic basis is likely strongly
influenced by environmental factors (Deth et al., 2008;
Hallmayer et al., 2011).
This study examines one possible environmental risk
factor: Exposure of the fetus to labor and delivery (L&D)
drugs during labor and the birthing process. There has
been a marked increase in the use of epidurals and labor-
inducing drugs in the past 30 years, during which time-
frame higher rates of autism diagnosis began occurring
(Rice and Benson, 1961; Baio, 2014). Additionally, it has
been reported that, although there is not sufficient evi-
dence to claim independent risk factors, obstetric condi-
tions were associated with an increased risk of autism,
when factored along with parental age (Kolevzon et al.,
2007). The two most commonly utilized classes of drugs
in the L&D process are labor-inducing drugs and anal-
gesic epidurals. The focus of this study analyzes uses of
two classes of drugs that can be administered during the
birthing process: induction and analgesic drugs. For
example, Pitocin is a labor-inducing drug that has been
in use since the late 1950s (Rice and Benson, 1961) and
Bupivacaine is a local analgesic often used as an epidural,
which is capable of crossing the placental barrier
(Johnson et al., 1995; Capogna et al., 1999; Leighton
and Halpern, 2002). There have been a few contradictory
studies concerning the role L&D drugs might have in the
development of autism. For example, data published
within the past decade indicate the labor-inducing drug,
Pitocin, may increase the risk of developing autism (Juul-
Dam et al., 2001; Glasson et al., 2004; Wahl, 2004), while
other recent publications contradict such findings and
suggest there are no associations between the use of
labor-inducing drugs and the risk of having a child diag-
nosed with autism at a later date (Gale et al., 2003;
Newschaffer et al., 2007; Rodier et al., 2011).
Consequently, further research is needed to understand
the possible role of L&D drugs in the development of
autism. Additionally, these previously published studies
only focus on labor induction drugs and not analgesics,
which are commonly administered (Gale et al., 2003;
Wahl, 2004; Gregory et al., 2013; Gialloreti et al., 2014;
Rosenstein et al., 2014; Weisman et al., 2015).
Therefore, using data collected from a survey con-
ducted with mothers who have children with and without
autism, we aimed to use this study to determine the effects
of L&D drugs on the development of an autistic pheno-
type. The results of this study could have significance not
only for the scientific community but also for the general
population, namely expecting parents. This research has
the potential to shed light on the possibility of environ-
mental effects, specifically drugs administered during
labor, on the development of autism. Greater under-
standing of the factors that may increase the risk of
developing ASD could lead to changes in drug adminis-
tration practices during the birthing process.
Material and Methods
Study population. The study was granted approval by the insti-
tutional review board at the Trinity University in San Antonio,
TX. Participants provided written consent and responses to
the survey were kept anonymous. Surveys were verbally
administered through in-person or phone interviews.
Participants were comprised of mothers with children
between the age of 2 and 25 who have been diagnosed
with ASD. Mothers with age-matched neurotypical chil-
dren served as controls. The participants completed a
questionnaire aimed at collecting information regarding
the labor experience for mother and children (Table 1).
Although mothers served as participants to provide retro-
spective experiences, the study group of interest was the
children. Therefore, the study included 49 children with
an ASD diagnosis and 104 children who do not meet
ASD diagnosis criteria.
Additionally, a dataset of 101 ASD cases was obtained
from the Southwest Autism Research and Resource
Center (SARRC). This dataset was collected and ana-
lyzed independently, using our nonautistic sample as a
control for comparison.
Data analysis. Questionnaire data were analyzed using
Fisher's test to determine significance between children

a post hoc analysis to determine the strength of significant
results obtained via Fisher's test. To determine if two inde-
pendent factors could potentially have a confounding effect,
the Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel (CMH) test was performed,
followed by the Tarone post hoc test. All analyses were
performed using the R (3.1.1) program with significance
set to .05.
Results
Labor & Delivery Drugs and Autistic Children
Based on the questionnaire completed by mothers of aut-
istic and nonautistic children, it was found that 28% of
children without autism and 12% of children with autism
were not exposed to L&D drugs during childbirth, while
72% and 88% of each group, respectively, were exposed
to an epidural, Pitocin, or a combination of the two
during delivery (Figure 1). Moreover, it was found that
individuals within the drug-exposed condition were 2.77
times more likely to exhibit an autistic phenotype than
individuals who had not been exposed to L&D drugs
during childbirth (p ¼ .039). The data received from
SARRC only included exposure to Pitocin. Therefore,
to compare our findings to the SARRC data, we analyzed
mothers who only received Pitocin during the child birth-
ing process to mothers who did not receive any drugs.
Within our dataset, labor induction was not significantly
associated with ASD (p ¼ .354). However, within the
independent SARRC dataset, there was a significant rela-
tionship between these two factors (p ¼ .004, OR ¼ 2.32).
Children with ASD in the SARRC sample were 2.32
times more likely to have undergone labor induction
(Figure 2).
Although our population of participants who were
diagnosed with autism exhibited a higher proportion of
L&D drug exposure than the control participants, there
were still a sizable number of individuals in the exposed
condition who remained neurotypical. This indicates that
L&D drug exposure cannot be an independent factor
accounting for the development of autism, suggesting
that an additional factor(s) must be present or occur in
order for the L&D drugs to have an impact on the devel-
opment of an ASD phenotype. We sought to determine
whether the duration of drug exposure during childbirth
could play a role in risk of autism; however, our results
showed duration of L&D drug exposure was not signifi-
cantly associated with the development of ASD (p ¼ .2;
Figure 3).
Within our dataset, birth complications were also
found to be significantly associated with the development
of ASD later in life. We observed that children with ASD
were more likely to have experienced birth complications
(p ¼ .004, OR ¼ 2.83). These findings were confirmed
using the SARRC dataset (p < .001, OR ¼ 2.66; Figure 4).
Since birth complications increase the likelihood of a
mother receiving L&D drugs, we sought to determine

independent or if there was a confounding effect.
Therefore, the CMH was performed, followed by the
Tarone post hoc test. Our results from the CMH analysis
revealed that there was no confounding effect, and birth
complications and L&D drug exposure had a synergistic
effect on the development of ASD (CMH ¼ 12.97,

Discussion
A Mother's Choice During Labor
It has been reported that the use of an epidural (either as
an analgesic for labor pains or to perform a caesarean
section) during the birthing process was more common to
mothers of children with a diagnosis of ASD, as com-
pared with controls (Glasson et al., 2004). Additionally,
previous studies have suggested that epidurals can nega-
tively impact the fetus, including impacting fetal core
temperature and leading to low Apgar scores at birth
(Glasson et al., 2004). Likewise, labor induction com-
monly occurs in obstetrics during the birthing process.
While the role of oxytocin on pregnancy and labor has
been well studied, the effects of administering exogenous
oxytocin (Pitocin) during labor have not been well
studied. Moreover, there have been conflicting reports
regarding the role Pitocin might play in the development
of ASD (Kenkel et al., 2014). Therefore, we analyzed the
potential impact epidurals and Pitocin might have on the
development of autism.
Results of our human survey study showed that chil-
dren in the drug-exposed condition during labor were 2.77
times more likely to exhibit an autism phenotype. While
the SARRC dataset only contained labor induction infor-
mation, it was observed that mothers who received Pitocin
during the birthing process were 2.32 times more likely to
have a child diagnosed with autism later in life.
The fact that not all children exposed to an epidural
(e.g. Bupivacaine), Pitocin, or both later developed an
autism phenotype suggests interaction with other factors,
which current research is attempting to elucidate. We
found that the duration of the L&D drugs was not

were compared based on the experience of a birth complication. Using the Fisher's exact test, children with ASD were 2.83 times more
likely to have been born after experiencing a birth complication, *p ¼.004, OR ¼ 2.83. These findings were supported by the SARRC
independent ASD (n ¼ 101) dataset and non-ASD (n ¼ 104). **p ¼.0009, OR ¼ 2.66.

significantly associated with an ASD diagnosis later in life;
however, experiencing a birth complication (e.g., fetal dis-
tress, pre-eclampsia, breech presentation, etc.) was signifi-
cantly associated with ASD. These findings are supported
by the independent dataset obtained from SARRC as well
as a previous study, which shows children diagnosed with
autism experienced more complications during birth, as
compared with controls (Glasson et al., 2004).
Furthermore, the L&D drug and the birth complications
associations were found to have a synergistic impact as it
relates the development of an ASD phenotype.
Limitations and Future Directions
We conducted a study that explored the possible role
L&D drugs might have in the increased prevalence of
ASD, in attempts to better understand possible environ-
mental factors and their connection to ASD. The results
from our study demonstrate an association between the
exposure to L&D drugs and the development of an
autism phenotype, in support of previous reports with
similar findings (Glasson et al., 2004; Wahl, 2004;
Kenkel et al., 2014). However, it is very unlikely that
L&D drugs alone would cause an autism phenotype;
like any environmental factor, assessment of risk in the
context of genetic predisposition should be performed.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that the current study
has a few limitations. The first limitation is the sample
size. We tried to address this limitation by including an
independent dataset, the SARRC dataset. However, the
SARRC dataset did not include all of the variables
found in our survey (e.g., information about analgesic
used during the birthing process). Furthermore, due to
the sample size limitation, when the data were stratified
for the type of L&D drug among the ASD group,
the Pitocin only group comprised 6% of our dataset,
while the Epidural only group comprised 48% and the
Epidural þ Pitocin group comprised 31%. This is in com-
parison to the SARRC dataset, where the Pitocin-exposed
children comprised 64% of their dataset. Therefore, the
divergent findings are likely due to the smaller sample
size in our dataset. While this highlights the importance
of a future independent study with a larger dataset to
verify such associations found within the SAARC dataset,
it does not reduce the significance of such findings.
However, in the future, we would like to conduct a
larger study to include collaborations with hospitals in
order to recruit patients for prospective studies, which
would also include data analyzed from medical records.
A second limitation is the fact that the data analyzed
were questionnaire data, which can be subject to recall
bias. An inherent known problem with association/case­
control studies is recall bias. However, it has also been
shown that the major problem with association studies
that use parental reporting is not recall bias, but
nondifferential misclassification (Infante-Rivard and
Jacques, 2000). Two attempts were made to avoid this
limitation: (a) careful selection of the questions included
in the questionnaire (e.g., Yes or No questions or numer-
ical ratings of 1 or 2) and (b) the included control group.
Furthermore, while recall bias could possibly impact
case­control studies, such studies have been extremely
informative within the scientific community, despite
some on the inherent limitations. Since the results from
our human study demonstrate a relationship between the
use of Pitocin and/or epidurals and the development of
an autism phenotype, a future independent study with a
larger sample size should be conducted.
