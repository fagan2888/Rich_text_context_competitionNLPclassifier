SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology and determinants of anti-hepatitis A
seroprevalence in 2- to 19-year-olds in the USA for 2007­2008. This study was conducted in a
sample of 2621 individuals aged 2­19 years in the USA using data from National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007­2008. The overall seroprevalence of
anti- hepatitis A virus (HAV) in this population was 39% (95% confidence interval 32.6­45.3).
HAV seroprevalence was higher in Mexican Americans than other ethnic groups, in younger
persons, and in those who reported previous vaccination compared to those who did not. We
concluded that anti-hepatitis A seroprevalence rates are increasing in younger individuals in the
USA, indicating a shift of seroprevalence over time due to vaccination status. Findings are
consistent with a persistent influx of infection through international travel and migration and
highlight the need to discern hepatitis A infection from vaccination status when assessing the
effectiveness of vaccination using seroprevalence data.
Key words: Cross-sectional, hepatitis A seroprevalence, prevalence, survey, vaccine.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is a common dis-
ease, particularly in children and is endemic in areas
with substandard hygiene and sanitation. The virus
accounts for 25% of all clinically evident acute
hepatitis and affects 10 million persons annually
worldwide [1, 2]. Persons affected with the disease
typically complain of low appetite and malaise and
present with jaundice. Hepatitis A is a self-limiting
disease with signs and symptoms lasting for a few
weeks and is not known to cause chronic hepatitis.
A previous infection is detected by the presence of
serum IgG hepatitis A antibody (anti-HAV) which
persists for years and possibly confers lifelong im-
munity against all strains of HAV. Since HAV rarely
causes fulminant hepatitis, the fatality rate associated
with the infection is extremely low [2].
Once common in the USA, HAV infection has
declined significantly in the era of hepatitis A vacci-
nation [1, 3­7]. With the introduction of the vaccine in
1995 and the recommendations by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization and Practices (ACIP) to
target the HAV infection-vulnerable population, the
annual incidence rates of clinical disease started to
decline from 12/100 000 in 1995 to 2.6/100 000 in 2003
and 1.0/100 000 in 2007 [3, 4]. In 1996 ACIP re-
commended vaccinating children aged o24 months in
high-risk communities; in 1999 ACIP recommended

more extended routine coverage for the same age
group; and in 2006, ACIP recommended vaccination
for all children in the USA, starting at age 12­23
months. Routine childhood vaccination resulted in
the precipitous decline of incidence in children, who
historically were disproportionately burdened by the
disease [1, 3, 5­8].
While developed countries have low hepatitis A
endemicity, in the USA, young children and Mexican
American or Hispanic children are at high risk of
HAV infection [9­12]. More than 15 years have
passed since the hepatitis A vaccine was introduced
in the USA. The fervour to decrease HAV infection
by targeting regions endemic for hepatitis A may
have afforded herd immunity thus altering disease
epidemiology. In 2007­2008, the NHANES included
serological testing for anti-HAV that provided
population-based seroprevalence data. We performed
an analysis of the hepatitis A data made available in
the NHANES 2007-2008 for subjects aged 2­19 years
in order to assess the current determinants of anti-
HAV seroprevalence in this age group as well as to
assess epidemiological profile changes 15 years after
hepatitis A vaccination was started.
METHODS
NHANES 2007­2008
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) provides cross-sectional infor-
mation on health and nutrition status that can be
generalized to the US civilian non-institutionalized
population. The survey uses a complex, stratified,
multistage probability sampling of households and
obtains data from consenting participants through
questionnaires and standardized health examinations.
Health examinations include physical and laboratory
tests conducted in mobile examination centres
(MECs). In NHANES 2007­2008, data were collected
from 10149 participants, weighted to represent close
to 300 million persons in the USA. NHANES over-
sampled Hispanics, African Americans, participants
aged o60 years, and low-income persons to obtain a
sample size sufficient for analysis of these demo-
graphic categories [13].
Subjects in this study
Of the 10149 participants of all ages, those between 2
and 19 years were eligible for a qualitative determi-
nation of total serum hepatitis A antibody (n=3306).
Of those eligible for anti-HAV testing, 2621 (79.3%)
had confirmed results, one indeterminate, and 684
(20.7%) did not have a specimen for analysis [14].
Laboratory methods and questionnaire
Solid-phase competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
was used to qualitatively determine anti-HAV in serum
or plasma. The intensity of the yellow-orange colour
change generated at the final step of the assay was
measured by a spectrophotometer at 492 nm cut-off.
A commercial assay kit was used to test for anti-HAV
(HAVAB-EIA solid-phase EIA kit, cat. no. 789524,
Abbott Laboratories, USA). Samples with absor-
bance f492 nm were considered reactive to anti-
HAV and labelled positive for the antibody while
samples with >492 nm absorbance were labelled
negative for anti-HAV. Solid-phase competitive
EIA does not distinguish seropositivity acquired
from hepatitis A infection or hepatitis A immuniza-
tion [14].
The NHANES sample person and family ques-
tionnaire provided demographic information of the
participants. For the analysis, age was categorized as
follows: 2­4, 5­9, 10­14, 15­19 years. NHANES
categorized race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic-Mexican American,
Hispanic-Other Hispanic, and Other. In this study,
2497 (95.3%) participants had information on both
race and anti-HAV status. The category `Other' was
excluded from the analysis. Participants indicating
place of birth other than USA were considered
foreign-born. For determination of socio-economic
status, the ratio of family income to the family's ap-
propriate poverty threshold as measured by the U.S.
Census Bureau was used. This variable was catego-
rized as follows in the analysis: <1.00, o1.00 to
<2.00, o2.00 to <3.00, o3.00 to <4.00, and
o4.00. If a family's total income is less than the
family's threshold income value, the index is <1 and
that family, and every individual in it, are considered
poor.
The participants' hepatitis A vaccination status was
determined using vaccination records and self-report.
Subjects aged o16 years were interviewed directly.
A proxy was interviewed for those aged <16 years
and those unable to answer questions. Vaccination
status was grouped as no vaccination, a single dose, or
two doses of vaccine. Other variables included in the
analysis were water source and the year the partici-
pant's home was built. Water source was categorized
418 E. Velasco-Mondragon, I. Lindong and F. Kamangar
into company-provided source and well, or other
sources.
Statistical analysis
Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the
method of sampling used by NHANES and to ensure
that the resulting estimates represent the US popu-
lation. We used logistic regression to calculate odds
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for hepatitis A vaccination status, adjusted for age,
gender, race, poverty level, country of birth, and year
home was built. All of these variables were included in
the multivariate models. Education and family size
were also examined in relation to anti-HAV status
but they were not associated with the outcome and
therefore were not included in the models. Since anti-
HAV seropositivity may be acquired through either
vaccination or previous natural infection, we con-
ducted a subgroup analysis for only those who were
not vaccinated to assess seropositivity due to natural
infection. Results with P<0.05 were considered sig-
nificant. Stata v. 10 (SVY module) was used to calcu-
late prevalence and odds ratios accounting for
weighting and complex sampling of the survey.
RESULTS
Based on the results from the 2621 participants tested
for anti-HAV, the overall prevalence of anti-HAV
antibodies in the US population aged 2­19 years
was 39% (95% CI 32.6­45.3) (Table 1). Out of
2314 subjects with a known vaccination status, 1132
(48.9%) had not been vaccinated. Of the latter,
23.7% (95% CI 17.5­29.9) were positive for anti-
HAV and therefore considered to be positive via pre-
vious HAV infection.
Demographics
Race/ethnicity was strongly associated with anti-
HAV seroprevalence. Seventy-five percent of Mexican
Americans, 49% of Other Hispanics, 37% of African
Americans, and 28% of Whites were positive for anti-
HAV. Being Mexican American increased the odds
for anti-HAV seroprevalence fivefold that of Whites
(OR 5.30, 95% CI 2.34­12.00) after adjusting for age,
gender, poverty level, year home was built, water
source and country of birth (Table 1). In the subgroup
analysis representing the non-vaccinated popu-
lation, the odds for anti-HAV seroprevalence among
Mexican Americans compared to Whites remained
almost the same (OR 5.49, 95% CI 1.93­15.64)
(Table 2).
The prevalence of anti-HAV decreased with age.
Fifty-five percent aged 2­4 years, 43% aged 5­9
years, 36% aged 10­14 years, and 33% aged 15­19
years had anti-HAV detected in their blood samples.
Compared to the 2­4 years group, persons aged 5­19
years had 2­3 times lower odds of anti-HAV sero-
prevalence (5­9 years: OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30­0.82;
10­14 years: OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20­0.56; 15­19
years: OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22­0.70) (Table 1). Persons
aged 5­19 years had lower odds even after removing
exposure to hepatitis A vaccination; however, the
95% confidence intervals included the null value
(Table 2). Figure 1 shows anti-HAV positivity and
HAV vaccine status proportions by age groups for the
past three rounds of NHANES.
Gender did not appear to influence anti-HAV
seroprevalence. Although females, both for the entire
population and the non-vaccinated subpopulation,
had lower odds compared to males, this was
not statistically significant (all: OR 0.94, 95% CI
0.73­1.22; non-vaccinated: OR 0.84, 95% CI
0.52­1.35).
Hepatitis A vaccination
Compared to non-vaccinated persons, those who re-
ported having received one and two doses of hepatitis
A vaccine had over six and three times greater odds of
testing positive, respectively (one dose: OR 6.77, 95%
CI 2.13­21.50; two doses: OR: 3.32, 95% CI
2.02­5.45). Mexican Americans and Other Hispanics
reported higher proportions of hepatitis A vacci-
nation than Whites and African Americans. Seventy-
two percent of Mexican Americans aged 2­19 years
reported receiving at least one dose of hepatitis A
vaccine compared to 71% of Other Hispanics, 53%
of African Americans, and 42% Whites.
Other contextual factors (water and housing
characteristics, poverty, country of birth)
Persons using water from sources other than company
providers had lower odds for anti-HAV sero-
prevalence although this difference was not signifi-
cant. In general, persons living in homes built before
the 1960s also had lower odds of anti-HAV sero-
prevalence compared to those living in homes built in
1990 onwards; however, these differences were also
not significant (Tables 1 and 2).
Hepatitis A seroprevalence in the USA 419
The association between poverty and overall anti-
HAV seroprevalence was not significant (Table 1).
However, in the non-vaccinated population, the odds
for anti-HAV seropositivity were generally lower for
those above the poverty threshold compared to per-
sons living in poverty (Table 2). Persons born outside
the USA had 50­60% greater odds of testing positive
for anti-HAV although this was not statistically
different from US-born persons (all: OR 1.59, 95%
CI 0.88­2.90; non-vaccinated: OR 1.51, 95% CI
0.54­4.23).

vaccination were the strongest predictors of anti-
HAV seropositivity in the 2­19 years age group.
Moreover, a younger age appeared to be a strong
predictor of anti-HAV seropositivity.
Race and demographics
Mexican Americans had the highest rates of vacci-
nation in this study. Seventy-two percent of Mexican
Americans aged 2­19 years in the USA reported
having received at least one dose of hepatitis A
vaccination. This result is consistent with previous
reports showing higher hepatitis A vaccination
coverage in Hispanic children [15, 16]. The latest
(2006) ACIP recommendation to routinely vaccinate
children aged 2­18 years in regions with o20 clini-
cally evident HAV infection cases/100 000 led to
the identification of 11 states (Alaska, Arizona,
California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma,
Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington) ­ all in
the western region, as priority areas for vaccination
[17]. The western region has the highest percentage
of Hispanic-origin dwellers ­ 19.1% and 24.3% in
the 1990 and 2000 censuses, respectively. Of these

Hepatitis A seroprevalence in the USA 421
11 western states, four had at least 10% Hispanic
population in the 1990 census and by 2000 the pro-
portion of Hispanics in these states had at least dou-
bled. Starting at the 2000 census, the country of origin
was specified for Hispanics where Mexican Americans
represented 58.5% of the US Hispanic population
[18]. The correspondence between geographic distri-
bution of the Hispanic population and the hepatitis A
vaccination priority areas explains the higher per-
centage of vaccinated Mexican Americans and Other
Hispanics which contributed to the high anti-HAV
seroprevalence in these groups.
In an attempt to examine the seroprevalence at-
tributable to natural infection, we conducted a sub-
group analysis limited to those who reported not
having received vaccination. In this subgroup analysis
results remained largely the same. Mexican Americans
had significantly higher odds of anti-HAV sero-
positivity acquired through previous HAV infection.
This finding was consistent with earlier anti-HAV
prevalence studies conducted prior to the introduc-
tion of hepatitis A vaccination that reported higher
seroprevalence in Mexican Americans compared to
non-Hispanic participants [9, 16]. Similar results were
seen in prevalence surveys involving children living
in Texas along the USA/Mexico border and families
of migrant farm workers in Florida. The higher
prevalence of infection in Mexican American and
Hispanic communities may be attributed to greater
exposure to HAV through higher exposure to HAV
infection in these communities or frequent travel
to HAV-endemic countries in Central and South
America and Mexico [9, 11, 12, 19]. A study of cases
of hepatitis A reported to the San Diego County
Health Department in Hispanic children aged f18
years linked infection to cross-border travel to
Mexico and its associated foodborne exposure [12, 20].
In addition to cross-border travel, other risk factors
were identified for schoolchildren living in a USA­
Mexico border community which include being in
first grade of elementary education, low maternal
educational attainment, >6 months residence in
Mexico, household crowding, and substandard sani-
tation system [21]. The same reasons may explain the
high prevalence of HAV infection in non-vaccinated
2- to 19-year-old Mexican Americans.
The results of this study suggest that in the range of
this study (2­19 years) younger individuals were more
likely to be seropositive. This is contrary to earlier
studies describing hepatitis A epidemiology where
age was one of the strongest predictors of anti-
HAVseropositivity [16, 22­25]. Indeed, in countries
where HAV vaccination is not provided, and in the
USA prior to vaccination, seropositivity rates would

increase with age because antibodies acquired
through natural infection provide lifelong immunity.
With the introduction of vaccines and decreasing
natural infection, the main source of antibodies will
be vaccines rather than natural infection and age-
patterns shift. Our analysis of the most recent
NHANES (2007­2008) showed an unexpected distri-
bution of seropositivity across age groups. This led us
to compare results with previous surveys (2003­2004
and 2005­2006, Fig. 1). We found slightly higher
seroprevalence rates across the younger three age
groups in the first survey, decreasing seropositivity
across the older three age groups in the second survey
and decreasing seropositivity across all groups in the
most recent survey (NHANES 2008). This trend
could be attributed to either higher rates of infection
in younger children that add to the vaccine sero-
positivity; to weaning of vaccine effect after a number
of years, hence leading to lower positivity rates in
older children or teenagers who received their vaccine
many years before; to use of more effective and
immunogenic vaccines for the younger children; or
to higher vaccination rates in younger children.
Nevertheless, these explanations are unlikely, since
most reports indicate that antibodies generated via
vaccination have a long life [26]; however, some stu-
dies have quantitatively documented decreasing anti-
body levels over time after hepatitis A vaccination
arguing for the need of booster doses [27, 28]. We are
not aware of any reports showing that the newer
vaccines are more immunogenic or effective. To study
whether younger children are being vaccinated at
higher rates, we conducted a subgroup analysis in
those who did not report vaccination. In this sub-
group analysis anti-HAV seropositivity was also
higher in younger children which may seem to refute
the hypothesis. However, it should be borne in mind
that reporting of vaccination is subject to non-differ-
ential misclassification. Therefore, it is still possible
that younger children are being vaccinated at higher
rates and due to misclassification of reporting the re-
sults show higher rates of seropositivity in those who
do not report having received a vaccine. However, a
similar misclassification effect on prevalence would be
expected to be seen in earlier surveys, which was not
the case.
Hepatitis A vaccination
Hepatitis vaccination was expected to be a strong
predictor of anti-HAV positivity. Available since
1995, the hepatitis A vaccine was routinely adminis-
tered to children living in the West and Southwest
regions where hepatitis was endemic causing the re-
versal of disease age distribution; infection rates are
now higher in adults particularly in men aged 25­39
years [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 16, 29].
The general recommendation in the USA for chil-
dren is two doses of hepatitis A vaccine administered
at least 6 months apart [3, 17]; however, the results of
this study did not indicate lower seropositivity rates in
those who received a single dose of hepatitis vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes
that all hepatitis A vaccination schedules are effi-
cacious in eliciting sufficient antibody levels for
protection against HAV infection and that high anti-
body levels are readily achieved by a single dose
[26]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pro-
tection conferred by a single dose of hepatitis A
vaccination.
We found that in each of the three NHANES
studies 13­25% of participants who reported having
been vaccinated for hepatitis A were seronegative,
with a larger percentage for older participants (Fig. 1).
This result may be attributed largely to misclassifica-
tion where participants erroneously report receiving
hepatitis A vaccination. However, if participant re-
ports were accurate for the most part, seronegativity
despite hepatitis A vaccination may reflect vaccine
failure or a shorter than expected vaccine-conferred
immunity. No changes in case definition or in lab-
oratory cut-off values for seropositivy occurred in the
three surveys.
Contextual factors
Poverty encompasses a number of socioeconomic
status indicators such as education, sanitation,
household characteristics, and income. In this study,
poverty was not significantly associated with anti-
HAV seropositivity. On the contrary, members of
the wealthiest group (family income to poverty ratio
of o4.00) have almost the same anti-HAV sero-
prevalence as the poorer participants (Table 1). This
increased risk appears to be inversely related to im-
munization since the anti-HAV prevalence in the
wealthiest subgroup drops from 40% (Table 1) in the
total group to 25% (Table 2) in those denying being
immunized. However, the protective effect of family
income against seropositivity acquired through natu-
ral infection, although not significant, can be seen in
non-vaccinated persons. In developing countries

where hepatitis A is endemic, the role of poverty in
hepatitis A disease transmission is firmly established
[22­25]. In the USA, immigration and international
travel, as previously discussed, were factors more
strongly associated with the spread of communicable
diseases like hepatitis A [9­12, 19, 21, 30­32]. The
country's accessibility to migrants from developing
nations and proximity to places where hepatitis A is
endemic may better explain the geographic and ethnic
distribution of the disease than poverty. Although a
study on HAV infection in the USA using NHANES
III identified poverty as a significant predictor of
HAV infection prevalence [16], the confounding in-
troduced by the revisions on the policies and re-
commendations on hepatitis A vaccination may have
reduced the ability of poverty to predict sero-
positivity. The higher odds among foreign-born per-
sons for seropositivity due to previous infection,
although not statistically significant, alludes to a
relatively better public health strategy like access to
potable water, efficient sewage disposal system, and
better housing among US-born persons. While com-
pany-provided water is the major water source in the
USA, the stronger association it had with anti-HAV
seropositivity than other water sources like wells for
non-vaccinated persons, may have been due to chance
secondary to a lack of a sufficient sample for analysis.
The inclusion of the year participants' homes were
built was based on the assumption that communities
with older homes are more vulnerable to spread of
hepatitis A due to older sewage systems that may be
potential sources of contamination. This is particu-
larly relevant for participants denying vaccination;
however the results showed that participants living in
older homes did not have elevated risks for anti-HAV
seroprevalence.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths. NHANES is rep-
resentative of the entire non-institutionalized US
population, and serum samples from over 2600 par-
ticipants were analysed for anti-HAV seropositivity.
Data were available for potential confounders
and subgroup analyses; however, very low numbers
of other Hispanic and Mexican Americans limited
our ability to draw conclusions from the results of
the non-vaccinated group. However, this study has
limitations too. Most notably vaccination was based
on self-report which may be subject to misclassi-
fication.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the results of this study showed that
Mexican Americans, while receiving higher rates of
vaccination, were still at higher risk of HAV infection
than other groups. Therefore racial/ethnic disparities
with regard to HAV exist and efforts to expand vac-
cination, especially to Mexican Americans may be
needed. Older children and teenagers were less likely
to be seropositive against HAV than younger chil-
dren, which may indicate a higher rate of vaccination
in younger children, increased infection rates or
gradual lower levels of antibodies years after vacci-
nation. All these explanations seem unlikely. In ad-
dition, herd immunity is unlikely to explain the
increased relative HAV prevalence in younger chil-
dren in NHANES compared to earlier surveys. The
latter may need to be investigated and, if needed,
booster vaccines may need to be considered. Finally,
the reasons why HAV-vaccinated subjects tested
negative to anti-HAV need to be further explored.
