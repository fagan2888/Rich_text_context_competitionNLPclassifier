Abstract
Background: Environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms with which humans commonly
interact. The epidemiologic characteristics of NTM diseases including mortality rate and its associated factors remain largely
unknown. In this study, we explored the geographical area of exposure and mortality and comorbid conditions of affected
persons to determine environment, host, and host-pathogen interactive factors.
Methods: We analyzed mortality related to nontuberculous mycobacterial infections from 1999 through 2010 by examining
multiple-cause-of-death data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among those who died with these diseases, we
analyzed age-adjusted mortality rates, trends, associations with demographic variables, and comorbid conditions and
correlated this information with similar data for tuberculosis-related mortality during the same time.
Measurements and Mean Results: From 1999 through 2010, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease was reported as an
immediate cause of death in 2,990 people in the United States with a combined overall mean age-adjusted mortality rate of
0.1 per 100,000 person-years. A significant increase in the number of NTM related deaths was seen from 1999 through 2010
(R2 = 0.72, p,0.0001), but it was not significant after adjustment for age. Persons aged 55 years and older, women, those
living in Hawaii and Louisiana, and those of non-Hispanic, white ethnicity had higher mortality rates. Compared to
tuberculosis-related mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, HIV, interstitial lung diseases, and
tobacco use were significantly more common in persons with nontuberculous mycobacteria-related deaths.
Conclusions: Nontuberculous mycobacteria-related death numbers are rising and are unevenly distributed. The strong
association of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease with age suggests that its prevalence will increase as the United States
population ages.

Introduction
Environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiq-
uitous in nature and have been isolated from domestic and public
water supplies, workplaces, and hospitals at rates with significant
variations depending on the regions. [1] The organisms also vary
widely in their ability to cause disease. This variation has been
long suspected to be caused by environmental factors, but as
infection rates have increased with no obvious environmental
source host factors are believed to be more and more important in
pathogenesis of NTM infections. More specifically, host-organism
interaction can be caused by a specific type of environmental
exposure, such as contact with a respirable aerosol or from a
specific host factor, such as stagnant mucus in a bronchiectatic
airway. [2,3].
The increase in NTM infections in recent years is remarkable.
The prevalence of diseases caused by these organisms was reported
to be between 1.6 to 1.8 per 100,000 population in the 1980s, but
recent North American studies have reported a higher prevalence
of 14.1 per 100,000. [4] Studies also indicate that pulmonary
infections caused by NTM are increasing in North America,
especially in people over 50 years of age. [5,6,7] In these North
American settings, the burden of nontuberculous mycobacterial
disease exceeds that of tuberculosis. [8] The basis for this increase
is unclear. Some speculate that improvements in diagnostics
secondary to the development and widespread utilization of
diagnostic support tools like computerized tomography (CT) scans
or new laboratory methods has led to the identification of more
cases that would have otherwise been misdiagnosed or overlooked.
Another possibility could be less ``herd immunity'' because of
decreasing rates of tuberculosis and less use of the Bacille
Calmette-Gue
´rin (BCG) vaccine. [9,10] Also, the increase in
number of immunocompromised hosts is suggested to be another
contributing factor. [11] It is also assumed that the rise in NTM
infections is congruent with the worldwide Human immunodefi-

ciency virus (HIV) epidemic as well as scientific advancements
leading to the more widespread use of chemotherapy and organ
and tissue transplantation. [12,13].
Epidemiologic factors of NTM diseases are particularly
important in diagnosis and management when compared to other
diseases. NTM diseases frequently present at various points of
disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to critical and at risk
of death. In many cases, demographic, geographic, and comorbid
host factors may determine where one falls within this range.This
study was designed to determine the trend of NTM-related
mortality in the last decade and related comorbidities. We also
aimed to discover current national and state prevalence and
mortality rates and to learn the demographic, geographic, and
comorbid conditions compared with persons suffering from
tuberculosis. Understanding these relationships could help to
define high-risk groups for death and develop strategies for
targeting prevention, treatment, and treatment intensity.
Materials and Methods
This study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review
Board of University of Illinois at Chicago (approval number of
2013­0446).
Study Design and Patient Data
This was a retrospective, population-based comparative study of
multiple causes of death data from the death certificates in USA
between 1999 and 2010. The data was obtained from the Wide-
ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER)
prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). [14,15].
The death certificates provided information on characteristics of
the decedent, including age at death, gender, race, and conditions
that led to death. Death certificates show a single underlying cause
of death (immediate cause of death), up to twenty comorbidities,
and demographic information. Diseases and related conditions
reported on the death certificate are coded in accordance with the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revisions (ICD-10)
for 1999­2010 data. [16].
Study's Variables
Variables included in the analysis were age, gender, race-
ethnicity, year of death, urbanization, place of death, cause of
death, and comorbid conditions. Race-ethnicity was categorized
according to US census standards as non-Hispanic white,
Hispanic, Asian-Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic black (black), and
American Indian-Alaska Native (Native American). Age at death
was grouped into the age groups less than 1, 1­4, 5­14, 15­24,
25­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­64, 65­74, 75­84, and $85 years.
The place of death was categorized as the hospital, the
decedent's home, hospice, and nursing home-long term care
facility. To find an association between the urbanization level of
residence and NTM-related mortality, the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) urban-rural classification was applied.
Urbanization was classified as 1) large central metropolitan, which are
counties with $1 million population that have the entire
population in a major city, or contain at least 250,000 residents
of any main city, 2) large fringe metro, which are counties with $1
million residents but do not meet the central metropolitan criteria,
3) medium metro, which are counties with between 250,000 to
999,999 residents, 4) small metro, which are counties with less than
250,000 residents, 5) micropolitan, which are cities that do not meet
the metro criteria, and 6) noncore, which are rural counties. [17,18].
Study Definitions
NTM-related mortality was defined as the immediate cause of
death from pulmonary or extrapulmonary nontuberculous myco-
bacterial infection. This included all observations that assigned any
of the ICD A31 codes as the immediate cause of death.
Tuberculosis-related mortality was defined by an immediate cause
of death with ICD-10 codes of A16 to A19.
Statistical Analysis
Counts and percentages were examined as predictors using
crude odds ratios and were tested by x2 tests or, if applicable, exact
tests. The crude mortality rate was not used in this study because
of the potential misleading information resulting from comparing
rates over the time in different age groups. Age-specific
tuberculosis-related mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for each age group. Age-adjusted mortality
rates were applied to measure relative mortality risk among groups
and over time. The selected population for the computation of
age-adjusted rates was ``2000 U.S. standard''. [19].
Univariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate
the mortality from nontuberculous mycobacteria- and tuberculo-
sis-related trends from 1999­2010.
In order to examine comorbid conditions, we compared NTM-
related deaths with tuberculosis-related deaths from 1999 through
2010 and computed crude odds ratio (OR) comparisons of selected
comorbidities. Data were suppressed by NCHS when the data
indicating fewer than ten persons to meet the principles for
confidentiality limitations. Death rates were labeled as ``unreli-
able'' when the numerator was less than 21. All analyses were
performed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL).
Results
Nontuberculous Mycobacterial- and Tuberculosis-related
Deaths Rates and Their Trends
From 1999 through 2010, a total of 2990 immediate NTM-
related deaths were identified, comprising 0.01% of the
29,176,040 total deaths in the United States. Comparing 1999­
2004 to 2005­2010, the NTM age-adjusted mortality rates rose
10% (from 0.069 to 0.077 per 100,000 person-years). From 1999
through 2010, the number of NTM-related deaths rose signifi-
cantly (R2 = 0.72, p,0.0001), but after correcting for the change
in age distribution of the general population, this rise was not
significant. Figure 1 shows the frequency of NTM and TB related
deaths per 100,000 populations by year, in the United States from
1999­2010.
By comparison from 1999 to 2010, a total of 8159 immediate
tuberculosis-related deaths were recorded. The number of TB-
related deaths significantly decreased during this time interval
(R2 = 0.94, P,0.0001), and TB-related age-adjusted mortality rate
decreased as well (R2 = 0.92, P,0.0001).
NTM-related Mortality Association with Age and Gender
The majority (87%) of NTM-related deaths occurred in those
older than 55 years of age. In comparison, 78% of tuberculosis-
related deaths happened in persons older than 55 (P,0.0001) (see
table 1 and Figure 2).
NTM-related mortality occurred in 1558 (52.1%) of women vs.
1432 (47.9%) of men.
Tuberculosis-related mortality occurred more in men than
women, 5005 (61%) vs. 3154 (38%).
Figure 3 shows the number of tuberculosis-related deaths
stratified by age and gender.

NTM and Tuberculosis-related Deaths and Ethnicity
The NTM related deaths rate between racial-ethnic groups was
substantially different. Although the largest proportion of deaths
occurred in whites (2567 deaths or 85% of all NTM-related
deaths), they had a slightly lower age-adjusted mortality rate than
Asian or Pacific Islanders (0.08 and 0.09 respectively). Tubercu-
losis-related deaths among ethnic groups were also disproportion-
al. Among those with tuberculosis, 4847 (59%) were white, but the
age-adjusted mortality was 0.15 person-years. It was lower than
Asian or Pacific Islanders of whom1044 (12.8%) died with an age-
adjusted rate mortality of 0.94 in 100,000 person-years (Table 1).
NTM-related Deaths and Geographic Variation
The NTM mortality rates varied among the states. The death
rates for NTM-related disease and tuberculosis and age-adjusted
mortality rates per 100,000 person-years are shown in figures 4
and 5. The age-adjusted NTM-related mortality rate was highest
in Hawaii, 0.29 per 100,000 person-years. This was more than
nine times higher than Michigan, which had the lowest rate of
0.03 per 100,000 person-years. Louisiana, Arizona, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Florida had age-adjusted rates of
0.17, 0.14, 0.14, 0.13 and 0.12 per 100,000 person-years and came
after Hawaii respectively (Figure 4). The tuberculosis-related
mortality was strikingly different. Alaska had the highest age-
adjusted rate of 0.76 per 100,000 person-years, which was 2.6
times more than the highest NTM-related age-adjusted rate (in
Hawaii). After Alaska, the highest age-adjusted mortality rates for
tuberculosis occurred in the District of Colombia, California,
Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico (Figure 5).
NTM-related Mortality and Place of Death
When comparing NTM-related mortality by place of death, the
majority of deaths occurred in hospitals (55%), nursing homes or
long-term care facilities (12%), and in the decedents' homes (23%).
Among people who died from tuberculosis, significantly more
individuals died in hospitals (76%) and fewer died in nursing
homes or long term care facilities (7%), and at home (11%). Deaths
occurred in hospital were significantly higher in TB group
(OR = 2.2, P,0.0001).
NTM-related Mortality and Urbanization
The comparison of NTM-related deaths with tuberculosis-
related deaths by urbanization is shown in table 1. More than 51%
of NTM-related deaths occurred in small and medium-sized
metropolitan areas and only 29% occurred in large central
metropolitan areas. However, the age-adjusted death rate related
to NTM in the micropolitan group was 0.1 (CI 0.09­0.11), which
is 1.3 times more than the age-adjusted NTM-related mortality in
large central metropolitan group which was 0.08 (CI 0.07­0.08).
There are no meaningful differences for NTM-related mortality
associated with urbanization.
The tuberculosis-related mortality had a strong urban predom-
inance; 41% of people dying with tuberculosis resided in large
central metropolitan areas with age-adjusted mortality rate of 0.32
(CI 0.31­0.33). Only 8.8% of persons with tuberculosis died in
micropolitan areas and had an age-adjusted mortality rate of 0.17
(CI 0.16­0.18) that was 1.9 times less than the mortality rate in
large central metropolitan areas. There was a significant difference
in mortality rate of large central metropolitan between NTM and
TB groups (OR = 1.44, P,0.0001).
To investigate the reason for the differences, we hypothesized
that access to a hospital might have been an important factor. We,
therefore, compared the frequency of place of death in NTM-
related deaths by urbanization categories. The percentage of
persons who died in hospitals with NTM as the cause of death was
62% in large central metropolitan areas, 58% in large fringe
metropolitan areas, 55% in medium metropolitan areas, 80% in
small metropolitan areas, 52% in micropolitan areas, and 64% in
non-core areas.
NTM-related Deaths and Involved Organs
Among 2990 individuals who died with NTM diseases, 2413
(80.7%) had pulmonary NTM, 62 (2.1%) had extrapulmonary,
and in 515 (17.2%) the organs involved were not specified. In the
tuberculosis group, 6259 (76%) had pulmonary, 1179 (15.2%) had
extrapulmonary, 669 (8.2%) had miliary tuberculosis, and in 52
(0.6%) subjects the organs involved were not specified.
Pulmonary involvement was reported significantly higher in
NTM group (P,0.0001).

Comorbidities
Compared with tuberculosis, several comorbidities were signif-
icantly more common in those dying from NTM diseases (table 2).
COPD was reported in 24% of NTM group as comorbidity but
only in 11% of TB group (OR = 2.5, P,0.001). However, the
frequency of emphysema in two groups showed no significant
difference. Bronchiectasis was significantly more common comor-
bidity registered in the patients who died from NTM diseases than
tuberculosis (OR = 3.7, P,0.0001). Interstitial lung disease was
found significantly higher in NTM compare to tuberculosis groups
(OR = 1.63, P,0.0001). Conversely, Diabetes mellitus was signif-
icantly reported lower in NTM group than tuberculosis group
(OR = 0.45, P,0.0001). HIV disease was reported significantly
higher in NTM group as comorbidity than TB group (OR = 7.67,
P,0.0001). The frequency of several other comorbidities showed
no statistically significant difference in the NTM and tuberculosis
groups including cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, heart failure, malig-
nant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung, malnutrition,
systemic lupus erythematous, Crohn's disease, any malignant
neoplasm, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, pneumoconiosis, de-
forming dorsopathies, and dementia including Alzheimer disease.
The data were not shown.

Nontuberculous Mycobacterial-Related Mortality

Discussion
This study showed that number of deaths from nontuberculous
mycobacterial infection is increasing especially in older women.
Hawaii demonstrated the highest age-adjusted mortality rate in
the US followed by southern states in the west and east. Medium
size metro and smaller areas have more than 50% of NTM related
deaths. The majority of NTM related deaths occur in the hospital
setting although this is less likely in small (micropolitan) cities.
Although, we found no meaningful difference for NTM related
mortality as was observed difference for TB related mortality on
urbanization.
The NTM prevalence was 1.8 per 100,000 in the US during
1980s. [20] Winthrop et al. reported its prevalence was 8.6 per
100,000 in Oregon, USA in the 2005­2006, with an age-adjusted
prevalence of 20.4 per 100,000 in those over 50 years old. In that
cohort, the median age was 66 years and 59% were women. [5] A
recent nationwide study in the US by Adjemian et al. showed the
prevalence of NTM disease was increasing across all regions in the
elderly. [21] Between 1997 and 2007, the annual prevalence
increased from 20 to 47 cases/100,000 persons, or 8.2% per year
among patients whom covered by Federal Health Insurance
Program (Medicare beneficiaries). The period prevalence for this
time was 112 cases/100,000 persons and was twice as much in
Asians/Pacific Islanders as whites (228 vs. 116 cases/100,000
persons).
Our study also demonstrates the increase in numbers of NTM-
related mortality from 1999 to 2010. We also show a striking
association between NTM death and age, consistent with the
analogous association between NTM prevalence and age. Given
the increasing median age in North America, the prevalence and
mortality of the mycobacterial disease will most probably increase.
[22] In fact, the current increase in NTM disease in North
America and the world could be explained, in part, by aging
populations. [23].

Our study also points out the strong correlations between
NTM-related mortality with many other medical conditions. The
correlation with smoking, hematologic malignancy and HIV is
stronger than with tuberculosis. As these chronic conditions
increase, the risk of death from nontuberculous mycobacterial
infection increases. It is important to note that many of the
associated conditions involve mucus pooling in the airways or
decrease clearance. The overwhelming percentage of disease being
confined to the lung also favors an airway defense mechanism
defect as a cause of NTM-disease.
Although tuberculosis-related deaths in the United States are
sharply decreasing and NTM-related deaths are increasing, NTM-
related mortality is much less than that of tuberculosis despite
higher prevalence of the environmental mycobacterial disease. [6]
One explanation for this discrepancy is that tuberculosis figures
are more likely to be accurate due to public health reporting
requirements. NTM diseases are not reported to public health
departments which this has led many to speculate that NTM-
disease is likely to be substantially underreported. Additionally,
missed diagnoses in mild and asymptomatic NTM subjects may
also decrease the number of the recorded cases. This occurs less
likely for tuberculosis infections due to its uniformly virulent
nature. [24] Finally, NTM may be a chronic and uncommonly
fatal disease, with significant morbidity but relatively low
mortality.
Although pathogen-host factors are important, there is geo-
graphical variation in NTM-related mortality. The southeast has
long been known to have a higher prevalence of NTM, which may
be attributed to its warmer and more humid climate. [25] Other
studies have shown coastal area had greater number of cases,
raising the conjecture that these mycobacteria flourished in wetter
climates. [20] But our study showed that states with the drier
weather, such as California, Arizona and New Mexico, also had
high NTM-related mortality rates. Our findings are consistent by
another NTM study. [21] Therefore, we believe that both warm
and dry climates may contribute to NTM disease and influence on
mortality by different environmental factors, such as temperature,
soil and water conditions. Our study also suggests that living
environment and possibly ethnicity contribute to NTM-related
mortality. Our finding suggests that NTM related mortality is
influenced much more by living in Hawaii than by being Asian/
Pacific islander. Some of NTM-related deaths occurred in rural
counties in our study. Rural communities may be associated with
more contact to water and soil in rural agricultural settings [26] or
less access to health care expertise, undermining the proper
identification and management of NTM cases.
NTM demonstrated a strong relationship with some comorbid
conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
respiratory failure, bronchiectasis, HIV, interstitial lung diseases,
rheumatoid arthritis, hematopoietic malignancies and tobacco use.
In comparison, tuberculosis is strongly associated with smoking,
HIV and hematopoietic malignancies, and may cause bronchiec-
tasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The association
between aging and NTM might be explained by more prevalence
of these chronic medical conditions in the elderly. In addition, the
features of these conditions can play an important role in the
pathogenesis of NTM diseases. For instance, bronchiectasis is a
known lung abnormality that makes patient susceptible to NTM.
[3,27,28,29].
The main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, although bronchiectasis is
often present and unrecognized. [30] The association with

Nontuberculous Mycobacterial-Related Mortality

stagnant mucus is established. The role of decreased airflow and
cough pressure in the pathogenesis of NTM disease is unknown.
Primary immunodeficiency is another condition that was found
in a few individuals in NTM-related deaths group. Although
defense against mycobacterium invasion relies on innate and
adaptive immunity [31], the small percentage of persons with
known immune deficiencies diagnosed with NTM forces us to
consider that structural defects of the epithelial barrier in addition
to immune status may be a contributor. Bronchiectasis, for
example, is associated with primary immunodeficiency and other
conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. [32,33].
The use of death certificate data is perhaps the most important
limitation of this study. Death certificates are well known to
misclassify variables. [34] In our study, we found that death
certificate records were often unclear regarding whether the
person died from mycobacterial disease or another cause of death.
Due to the less severe disease presentation which is common in
NTM, clinicians may not consider mycobacterial infections the
immediate causes of death or an important underlying condition
when completing death certificate. It is likely that physicians do
not check the American Thoracic Society criteria for NTM disease
before filling out the death certification. We believe that these poor
documentations have a significant impact on NTM death
certificates database. Unfortunately, death certificates database
for NTM remains one of the more reliable data sources. Using
ICD codes to detect nontuberculous mycobacterial disease may
cause missing 25% to 75% of the cases. [35] Given the severe
nature and clinical awareness for tuberculosis, it is unlikely that
primary data in this arm is equally unrepresented. Physicians are
more aware of tuberculosis because it is communicable, and
reportable which requires health system monitoring. Therefore, it
is much more likely to be reported accurately. Because environ-
mental mycobacterial disease lacks these features, especially
virulency, we think our data most likely represent an underesti-
mate of true magnitude of the NTM mortality. Therefore, our
findings might be interpreted as minimum estimates.
In summary, this United States population-based study shows
that the number of deaths from nontuberculous mycobacterial
disease is rising, but this increase is largely explained by the change
in age distribution of the US population. There is considerable
variation in different groups, which could be due to environment,
host and host-pathogen interactive factors.
