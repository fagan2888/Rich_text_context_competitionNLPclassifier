ABSTRACT
Background: Food insecurity, a condition of low or very low food
security, is associated with decreased nutrient intake and poor
health, which can lead to nutrient deficiency in children, including
iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to formally investigate the
current relation of iron status and food security status among chil-
dren aged 3­19 y (n = 11,247).
Design: Participants of the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey 1999­2004 were classified for food security status by
using the US Children's Food Security Scale and the US Household
Food Security Scale. Iron deficiency was defined as 2 abnormal
values for transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and erythrocyte pro-
toporphyrin, with the addition of abnormal hemoglobin to classify
iron deficiency anemia.
Results: The odds of iron deficiency anemia among children aged
12­15 y were 2.95 times (95% CI: 1.18, 7.37; P = 0.02) those
for children in households with food insecurity among children
compared with children in households with food security among
children.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate a continuing need
for successful interventions to reduce iron deficiency anemia among
food-insecure children and to improve food security among chil-
dren. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;90:1358­71.
INTRODUCTION
A substantial number of US children do not have ensured
access to food. Food security is a term defined as, "access by all
people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life."
Children who are food insecure have "limited or uncertain
availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or
uncertain ability to acquire acceptable food in socially acceptable
ways" (1). Using data collected by the US Census Bureau, Nord
et al (2) estimated that 12.6 million children (17.2%) lived in
food-insecure households (2).
Food insecurity broadly defines an experience ranging from
eating less desirable foods, to skipping meals, to not eating for an
entire day (3). Diet is perhaps the most obvious and immediate
consequence of food insecurity. Food-insecure children may
consume a diet that puts them at risk of health outcomes asso-
ciated with lower intakes of nutrients, including iron (4­6). Meats
such as beef, pork, and poultry contain heme iron and have the
highest iron bioavailability (7). Yet, the expense associated with
meats may limit access for food-insecure children. Lower intakes
of iron were observed in food-insufficient than in food-sufficient
children aged 1­5 y by using data from the Continuing Survey of
Food Intakes by Individuals (4). Food-insecure children were also
observed to have a restricted intake of foods from the meat food
group compared with food-secure children (8). In consequence,
food-insecure children and adolescents may be unable to obtain
the necessary iron they need for proper growth and development.
Sufficient iron in young children is imperative for proper
psychomotor, mental, behavioral, and cognitive development (9­
14). Puberty is another critical time for iron nutrition in females
starting menstruation (15­17). Inadequate iron intake in food-
insecure children and adolescents may result in iron deficiency
and iron deficiency anemia (18).
The research focusing on iron and related health outcomes has
been narrow in coverage of food-insecure children and has used
iron variables that cannot be compared between studies (4­6, 19,
20). Iron deficiency anemia has not been compared between food-
secure and -insecure groups of children aged 3­19 y. Additional
research is needed to determine the consequence of food in-
security regarding iron in children. The purpose of this study was
to investigate the strength of the association of food security
status and body iron stores among children aged 3­19 y from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999­2004. The secondary aim was to evaluate the associations
between food security status and selected dietary exposures
associated with iron status: the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Food Guide for meat and grain intakes and the Estimated
Average Requirement (EAR) for iron.

(CDC). NHANES participants were representative of and drawn
from the noninstitutionalized and civilian US population. A
complex multistage, probability sampling method was used to
select participants on the basis of age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Cer-
tain cycles of the survey oversampled certain subpopulations to
allow for the generation of more precise and reliable estimates for
these groups. Oversampled groups from 1999 to 2004 included
non-Hispanic black Americans, Mexican Americans, low-income
white Americans, adolescents aged 12­19 y, and individuals aged
.60 y (21). Participants of NHANES completed an in-depth
questionnaire that assessed dietary behaviors, socioeconomic
indicators, and health history in the participants' homes and at the
NHANES Mobil Examination Center (MEC). In addition,
participants visited the MEC to undergo a physician-conducted
assessment of medical, dental, and physiologic health indexes. A
24-h dietary recall was administered, and biological samples were
collected from the participants (eg, blood, urine, and hair). A
subsample completed a telephone-administered 24-h dietary
recall 3­10 d after the MEC visit.
Proxy reporting for children aged 1­5 y was completed by
a child's parent or guardian, whereas the reporting of children aged
6­11 y was parent- or guardian-assisted. Children aged 12 y
completed some portions of the interview independently of their
parents or guardians. Consent was required for all participants
and was given by a parent or guardian for children younger than
18 y. Child consent was additionally requested for children aged
12 y (21). The NCHS Research Ethics Review Board reviewed
and approved NHANES protocol for all NHANES content (22).
The Purdue Committee on the Use of Human Research Sub-
jects approved all of the research activities included in this
analysis.
Participants of this analysis included all nonpregnant children
and adolescents from 3 to 19 y who successfully completed the
household interview and participated in the MEC examination
(n = 11,818). Exclusions were made for all participants without
Household Food Security classification and participants aged
3­15 y without Child Food Security classification (n = 513),
individuals who donated blood in the past month (n = 25),
and participants with a lead concentration .10 lg/dL (n = 33)
(23). Therefore, the sample size for this analysis was 11,247
individuals.
Family and sample person questionnaire
Characteristics queried in the questionnaire portion of the
survey were age, sex, race-ethnicity, annual household income,
presence of a smoker living in the household, dietary supplement
use in the past 30 d, sickness that started in the past 30 d (includes
head cold, chest cold, flu, pneumonia, ear infection, stomach, and
intestinal illness), blood donation in the past 12 mo (aged 16­19
y), number of school meals eaten each week (ages 6­19 y),
menstruation status (females aged 6­19 y), use of birth control at
the time of the survey (females aged 12­19 y), and household
participation in the USDA Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.
Food Security Survey Module
The US Household Food Security Survey Module (FSSM) was
included in the household interview. This questionnaire has been
extensively evaluated for validity and reliability and shown to
accurately quantify access to food (24­33). The questions con-
tained in the 18-item FSSM direct participants to consider food
eaten in their households over the past 12 mo (34) and to evaluate
household, individual, or child-specific access to food. Food
security of household adults and children is classified into 1 of 4
ranges on the continuum of food security: "household full food
security" defines a situation in which there are no problems or
anxieties for household members regarding food; "household
marginal food security" occurs when household members have
anxiety regarding food or problems in attaining food, but quality,
variety, and quantity are not reduced; "household low food se-
curity" exists when quality, variety, and desirability are reduced
yet quantity remains adequate; and "household very low food
security" occurs when eating patterns are disrupted and food
quantity is reduced due to inadequate resources. Household full
and marginal food-security classifications are often grouped and
referred to as "food secure," whereas low and very low food
security classifications are referred to as "food insecure" (3).
Eight child-specific questions contained in the FSSM are used
to determine food security among household children (35). Child-
specific household food-security classifications are defined
similarly to household classifications but are labeled as follows:
"child food quality and quantity unaffected," "child reduced food
quality or quantity," "child reduced food quality and quantity,"
and "child severely reduced quality and quantity" (21). House-
hold and child-specific household food-security classifications
were included in the NHANES data release.
Child-specific household food security was selected as the
most direct and reliable measure to quantify the experience of
hunger or reduced food intake for children aged 3­15 y (35­38) in
this analysis. Additional analysis by household food security was
also performed in these age groups (data not shown). Child-
specific household food-security classification was not provided
for children aged 18­19 y--an age group with an insufficient
number of participants to be analyzed separately. Thus, the age
group 16­19 y was solely analyzed by household food security, as
determined by the 18-item FSSM.
Laboratory examination
All participants underwent blood collection by venipuncture at
the MEC. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and free eryth-
rocyte protoporphyrin were measured at the CDC in Atlanta, GA.
Serum ferritin was measured by use of the Bio-Rad QuantImune
Ferritin IRMA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Trans-
ferrin saturation was calculated by dividing serum iron by total-
iron-binding capacity; both were measured by a modification
of the automated Technicon AAII-25 ferrozine colorimetric
method (Alpkem TFA analyzer; Alpkem, Calackamas, OR). Free
erythrocyte protoporphyrin was quantified by fluorescence ex-
traction by using a modification of the Sassa method (39). He-
moglobin was determined in the NHANES MEC with the Coulter
MAXM automated electronic counter (Coulter Electronics,
Hialeah, FL) as part of a complete blood count. Latex-enhanced
nephelometry was performed at the University of Washington to
measure C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood lead was measured at
the CDC with a Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, MA) model SIMAA
6000 simultaneous multi-element atomic absorption spectrometer
with Zeeman background correction. Quality-control methods

were implemented for all procedures. A detailed description of the
assaymethodsusedtodeterminethebiochemicalindicatorsofiron
status used in this study were described elsewhere (21).
Iron-status variables
Iron deficiency was defined by the presence of 2 abnormal
values for the indicators serum ferritin (,10 lg/L for ages 3­5 y
and ,12 lg/L for ages 6­19 y), transferrin saturation (,12% for
ages 3­5 y, ,14% for ages 6­15 y, and ,15% for ages 16­19
y), and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (.1.24 lmol/L red
blood cells for ages 3­19 y), as classified by Looker et al (40).
Low hemoglobin (,11.2 g/dL for ages 3­5 y, ,11.8 g/dL for
ages 6­11 y, ,11.9 g/dL for females aged 12­15 y, ,12.6 g/dL
for males aged 12­15 y, ,12.0 g/dL for females aged 16­19 y,
and ,13.6 g/dL for males aged 16­19 y) in addition to a de-
termination of iron deficiency were necessary to classify iron
deficiency anemia (40). Hemoglobin cutoffs were 0.4 g/dL
lower for non-Hispanic blacks younger than 5 y, as recom-
mended by the Institute of Medicine (41). Only data from 1999
to 2000 and 2001 to 2002 were used for ages 6­11 y because
iron-deficiency indicators were not quantified for this age group
in the 2003­2004 survey. CRP (.1.0 mg/L) (42) was selected
for use as a serum indicator of inflammation--a condition that
may cause fluctuations in iron indicators independent of iron
deficiency (43).
Dietary assessment
The examination component of NHANES included the col-
lection of a 24-h dietary recall via the USDA's Automated
Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) (44) in the MEC. The second 24-
h dietary recall was available only for NHANES 2003­2004. The
AMPM takes '30­45 min to complete. Five passes, or series of
probes, are used in the AMPM to retrieve as many foods as
possible that were consumed in the past 24 h. The dietary in-
formation collected with the AMPM is linked to the USDA Food
and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (45), a nutrient
composition database, which includes information on an esti-
mated 7000 foods. The AMPM computerized software system
allows for direct coding of the reported foods, recipe modifi-
cation and development, data editing and management, and
nutrient analysis of dietary data (44).
Total iron intake (mg/d) was included in the NHANES data
release. Iron intakes for each sex and age were compared with the
sex- and age-specific EAR to determine fulfillment of the re-
quirement (46). Total iron from meat and total iron from grain
were calculated by identifying meat and grain foods by using the
USDA food code assigned to each food listed in the 24-h dietary
recall. Total ounces of meat and grain products consumed were
determined similarly by using the USDA food code to identify the
foods. Gram weight of each individual food was converted to
ounces by the conversion factor 1 oz/28.349 g, followed by
summation of the ounces of each type of food. Total ounces
consumed from these food groups were compared with reference
ounces given in the USDA Food Guide (47) to determine whether
intake met the recommendation for each sex and age defined for
moderately active children.
Anthropometric measures
Height and weight were collected in the examination portion of
the survey by using a stadiometer for height and a Toledo scale for
weight, which were supported by the Integrated Survey In-
formation System for the immediate capture and recording of
data. These measures were converted to BMI-for-age for each
individual by linking the data to indexes of anthropometric status
based on the CDC Growth Charts (48). Overweight status was
determined by comparing BMI with the CDC growth chart
standards (49). Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to run the NCHS/CDC available
SAS program to determine percentiles from the growth charts
(48).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were stratified by age (3­5, 6­11, 12­15, and 16­
19 y) for consistency with NHANES procedures and tests con-
ducted by age. Indicator variables were created for race-ethnicity
as non-Hispanic white (reference), non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, and a combined group of other Hispanic, other race,
and multiracial participants. The race-ethnicity groups in the
combined group were each too small in sample size to be
classified as independent groups. Although together these indi-
viduals likely represent a diverse group within themselves, as
well as between the other groups, the benefits of combining this
diverse group outweighed the loss of power that would occur with
their exclusion from the analysis, or their blending with other
dominant groups.
The poverty-income ratios included in the NHANES data were
calculated as household income divided by the federal poverty
guideline for household income. The poverty-income ratio was
simplified to a continuous variable with a range of 0 to 5 (50). For
this analysis, the poverty-income ratio was classified into 4
groups: 0­0.99, 1.00­1.99, 2.00­2.99, and 3.00­5.00 (indicator
variables) (50). Alternatively, the poverty-income ratio was
classified into 6 groups: 0­0.99, 1.00­1.99, 2.00­2.99, 3.00­3.99,
4.00­4.99, and 5.00.
Household participation in WIC was categorized as yes or no;
presence of a smoker living in the household as yes or no; birth
weight as ,5.5 lb or 5.5 lb, use of a dietary supplement in the
past 30 d as yes or no; sickness starting in the past 30 d as yes or
no; number of school meals eaten per week as 0, 1­5, or 6­10
(indicator variables); menstruation started or not yet started; use
of birth control at the time of the survey as yes or no; and survey
cycle year as 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 (indicator
variables). The number of months since the last blood donation
was also classified on the basis of self report in the interview.
Because of the small number of participants classified into
"low food security" and "very low food security, " food-security
classifications were collapsed into 2 categories: 1) "full food
security/marginal food security", or "food secure," and 2) "low/
very low food security," or "food insecure" (35). Iron deficiency
and iron deficiency anemia were categorized as present or not
present, and CRP was defined as above the cutoff or at or below
the cutoff. The dietary variable created for total iron intake was
defined as greater than or equal to the EAR or less than the EAR.
Meat-source iron intake and grain-source iron intake were de-
fined as greater than or equal to the median intake of the food-

secure group or less than the median intake of the food-secure
group. The amounts of meat and grain foods consumed were
defined similarly as greater than or equal to the recommended
intake or less than the recommended intake. Participant BMI
was categorized into 3 groups: less than the 85th percentile as
"normal," between the 85th and 95th percentile as " at risk of
overweight," and greater than the 95th percentile as overweight
(51, 52).
A descriptive analysis by food-secure and -insecure groups
was completed for categorical variables (Tables 1­4). Chi-square
analysis was used to compare food-secure and food-insecure
children and adolescents of each age group regarding the char-
acteristics defined by the categorical variables. Logistic re-
gression was used to determine the odds of iron deficiency
compared with no iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia
compared with no iron deficiency anemia for food-insecure and
food-secure children and adolescents of each age group. Models
of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia were examined
with and without exclusion of participants with inflammation
indicated by abnormal CRP values; no difference in results were
observed (data not shown).
Logistic regression was also used to compare the dietary
intakes of food-insecure and food-secure children and adoles-
cents. Dietary analysis was completed for all 1999­2004 par-
ticipants by using the dietary values derived from the single 24-h
recall. In addition, analysis was completed for 2003­2004 par-
ticipants by using an average value for each variable that was
computed from the 2 d of dietary data available for these years
(data not shown). Nine models were constructed for each age
group for both 1999­2004 and 2003­2004 analysis. Total dietary
iron intake below the EAR was compared with total dietary iron
intake above or equal to the EAR in food-insecure and -secure
groups. Participants with total meat-source iron intake (including
beef, pork, lamb, veal, game, organ meats, frankfurters, sausages,
luncheon meats, poultry, shellfish, fish, and mixtures with meat as
the main ingredient) below the median of the food-secure group
were compared with participants having a total meat-source iron
intake equal to or above the median of the food-secure group.
Similarly, participants with a total grain-source iron intake (in-
cluding yeast breads, rolls, cereals, pastas, quick breads, pan-
cakes, French toast, cakes, cookies, pastries, pies, crackers,
popcorn, pretzels, corn chips, and mixtures with grains as the
main ingredient) below the median of the food-secure group were
compared with participants having a total grain-source iron in-
take equal to or above the median of the food-secure group. Total
grain-source iron without inclusion of sweet grains (eg, cakes,
cookies, pastries, and pies) and total grain-source iron without
sweet grains and quick-breads (eg, muffins, pancakes, and French
toast) were also modeled (data not shown) with no difference in
results. Not meeting the USDA Food Guide for meat intake and
grain intake compared with meeting the USDA Food Guide for
meat intake and grain intake, respectively (47) were modeled to
compare food-insecure with food-secure children and adoles-
cents. In addition, models for recommended intake of grains
without sweet grains, and grains without sweet grains and quick-
breads were constructed with no difference in results (data not
shown).
All variables included in the analysis were categorical in
nature. Survey weights were applied to all analyses, and all
models were adjusted for clustering, stratification, survey cycle
year, sex, race-ethnicity, and poverty-income ratio (21), as were
unevenly distributed variables identified by chi-square analysis in
Tables 1­4. The potential confounder, sickness starting in the past
30 d, was tried in all models with no effect on the significance of
the independent variable. Another potential confounder, poverty-
income ratio, was included in all models as 4 indicator variables
and separately as 6 indicator variables (data not shown) with no
effect on the primary exposure, food-security status. All other
variables were considered in the selection of the best model,
and effect modification was examined. All regression and chi-
square analyses were completed in SAS 9.1 by using SAS
Survey procedures to account for the complex survey design
used in NHANES. A P value ,0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Participant characteristics of food-secure and food-insecure
children of the various age groups are given in Tables 1­4.
Adjusted chi-square analysis indicated a significantly greater
proportion of food-insecure participants of all age groups
compared with food-secure participants living in a household
with a poverty-income ratio ,1.0 living in a household that
received WIC benefits, living in a household with a smoker, not
using a dietary supplement, and eating more meals at school
(ages 6­19 y). Food-insecure participants also had a signifi-
cantly different race-ethnicity composition as a group compared
with food-secure participants.
The prevalence of BMI classification as "at risk of overweight"
and "overweight" was significantly higher among children in
households with food insecurity among children compared with
children in households with food security among children for the
3­5 and 12­15 y age groups. Children aged 16­19 y in house-
holds with food insecurity were less likely to get their iron from
grain sources than were their food-secure counterparts. A similar
finding was observed in children aged 12­15 y from households
with food insecurity among children. Participants aged 16­19 y
living in food-insecure households were also less likely to meet or
exceed the EAR for iron compared with participants living in
food-secure households.
The adjusted odds of iron deficiency anemia was 2.95 times
more likely (P = 0.02) among children in households with food
insecurity among children aged 12­15 y than among children in
households with food security among children (Table 5). In
adjusted models, iron deficiency was observed to be 49% less
likely among children in households with food insecurity among
children aged 6­11 y than among children in households with
food security among children. The total dietary iron intake was
1.87 times as likely (P , 0.001) to be below the EAR among
children aged 16­19 y from household food-insecure residences
than among children from food-secure households (Table 6).
Food-insecure children aged 16­19 y were also 1.52 times as
likely (P = 0.028) to have a grain-source iron intake below the
median intake of children from food-secure households (Table
6). Adjusted models for other age groups using household food
security and iron status or dietary iron were not statistically
significant. Differences were not observed between children of
household or child-specific food security/insecurity regarding
their fulfillment of the USDA Food Guide meat and grain rec-
ommended intakes. The dietary analysis of 2003­2004 partic-
ipants using the average values computed from two 24-h recalls
also showed no differences between children regarding food-
security status.
DISCUSSION
This study was the first to document an association between
food insecurity and iron deficiency anemia among children aged

12­15 y. On the basis of our findings, food-insecure children in
this age group were almost 3 times as likely to have iron de-
ficiency anemia than were food-secure children. Early adoles-
cence is a critical time for iron nutrition because of higher iron
demands accompanying rapid growth (15, 16) and onset of
menses in females. Adolescent females have a high US preva-
lence of iron deficiency (40). Our results suggest that food-
insecure children may experience an even more widespread and
severe case burden.
The increased odds of iron deficiency anemia in food-insecure
children aged 12­15 y may also be explained by growing dietary
independence and diminished parental protection. Food may not
be reserved preferentially for household food-insecure children
of these ages, as has been shown for younger children (30, 35,
53). Parents may consider older children able to take on the
burden of food insecurity out of necessity. Additional behavioral,
environmental, and psychological factors associated with food
insecurity may also influence iron status (3).
Iron deficiency anemia in 12­15-y-olds was not associated with
household food insecurity despite a significant association with
food insecurity among household children. Household food-
security classification may be less sensitive than child-specific
household food-security classification because of differential in-
dividual food security within the household. Adolescent food in-
security was underestimated by 33% and 20% by using the US
HFSSM in children aged 6­14 and 15­17 y, respectively, compared
with a child-specific food-security measure (35) that may more
accurately classify the experience and behavior of children (35).
The increased likelihood of iron deficiency in children aged
6­11 y from households with food security than in their food-
insecure counterparts was perplexing. No other age group
exhibited a similar outcome. Iron-status measures for children
aged 6­11 y were not available in NHANES 2003­2004, so only
participants from 1999 to 2002 were selected, yielding a much
smaller sample size compared with other age groups. Iron-
deficient children of these ages also exhibited different charac-
teristics (data not shown) than iron-deficient anemic children,
because most were normal to overweight Mexican American
females from nonsmoking food-secure households with a
poverty-income ratio ,2.00 who did not meet the USDA Food
Guide­recommended meat intake. Iron deficient anemic chil-
dren of this age group were primarily overweight females of
varied race-ethnicities from smoking, food-insecure households
with a poverty-income ratio ,2.00 who did not meet the USDA
Food Guide­recommended grain intake. Food choice, BMI
status, and household smoking among low-income racial-ethnic
groups may have interacted to determine the presence and se-
verity of iron deficiency. Food security and iron status by
number of years in the United States may also be explored in
future studies. Brotanek et al (54) used NHANES 1976­2002
data and reported similar trends of greater iron deficiency
prevalence among Mexican American, overweight children aged
1­3 y from households with an income less than the poverty
threshold than among other race-ethnicity, weight-for-height,
and income groups. However, similar results of association be-
tween iron deficiency and food security have not been

documented. Alaimo et al (19) found no association between
iron deficiency among food-sufficient and -insufficient children
aged 1­5 and 6­16 y using NHANES III data. We also found no
association for children aged 3­5, 12­15, and 16­19 y.
The logical expectation of a significant association between
iron deficiency anemia and food insecurity is an accompanying
association with iron deficiency; however, this was un-
documented in our study. An explanation may be found in the
trend for individual household food insecurity, known to often
be short in duration but to occur frequently throughout the year
(55). Food-insecure and iron-deficient children may experience
frequent bouts of food insecurity, which results in a chronic
situation in which iron depletion is not sufficiently restored
between food-insecure periods. Iron deficiency may not be
sufficiently long term in affected food-secure children to result
in a large case burden of iron deficiency anemia. Yet, anemia

may be more frequent in chronically iron-deficient and food-
insecure children than in iron-deficient and food-secure chil-
dren, in whom iron deficiency may be tempered by health care
or a better diet. Less frequent exposure and duration of food
insecurity may result in less frequent progression of iron de-
ficiency to anemia.
Our results also indicated that the chance of iron deficiency
anemia was '11 times greater in food-insecure than in food-
secure children aged 3­5 y, and the chance of iron deficiency was
'8 times greater in food-insecure children aged 6­11 y than in
their food-secure counterparts. However, the 95% CIs for these
ratios were extremely wide: 1.49, 76.87 and 2.07, 31.36, re-
spectively, and should be interpreted with caution. The number of
cases was very small in both age groups, which prevented the
calculation of a stable estimate. Nevertheless, similar results with
a younger age group (6 mo to 3 y) of food-insecure children have
been documented (20). Food-insecure children were 2.4 times as
likely to be classified as having iron deficiency anemia than were
food-secure children (20). These observations, along with signifi-
cant results for iron deficiency anemia among 12­15 y children,
suggesta trendofunequalburdenamongfood-secureand-insecure
groups that merits further investigation in all pediatric age groups.
Foodinsecurityin16­19-y-oldswasassociatedwithinadequate
total iron intake. These food-insecure adolescents also consumed
less iron from grain sources than did food-secure adolescents.
Adequate iron intake may not be a priority for adolescents during
the transition to independence. Children aged 16­19 y may have
very little parental input regarding food choices and may be
experimenting with alternative diets, dieting, and eating less
nutrient-rich foods. Food-insecure adolescents may be particu-
larly vulnerable because they have fewer monetary and food
resources.
Selection bias may be present in this study and is one possible
limitation to our findings. Many young children had missing iron-
status indicators that may have been a result of phlebotomy
refusal (56). Confinement of the 2-d adjusted dietary analysis to
include only NHANES 2003­2004 participants may have
resulted in statistical power that was too low to determine dif-
ferences by food-security status. Dietary data may have been
more complete and accurate if more than one dietary assessment
method was available in NHANES 1999­2004 and more than one
24-h dietary recall collected for all years.
In addition, children and adolescents as a group present
considerable challenges for dietary assessment because of highly
inconsistent diets and rapid changes in type and pattern of food
intake (57). Adolescents may be less concerned with giving an
accurate report of diet than are adults (57, 58).
Iron deficiency anemia is a serious concern for food-insecure
adolescents. This study is evidence of health disparities that
continue to exist in food-insecure children, despite US policy and
programs directed to this audience. Successful and ongoing
interventions are required to improve food security among
children and to reduce iron deficiency anemia among food-
insecure children.
