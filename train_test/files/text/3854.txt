Abstract
Background: The purpose of this study was to examine whether drinkers would change their alcohol consumption
behavior if an effective hangover treatment became available.
Methods: An online survey was held among Dutch students, aged 18­30 years, who recently had a hangover.
Participants were asked (1) whether they would buy an effective hangover treatment if it became available and (2)
whether using such a product would increase their alcohol consumption. In a follow-up survey, the same partici-
pants could clarify their answers in detail.
Results: A total of 1837 subjects completed the survey: 69.9% of the participants indicated they would buy an
effective hangover treatment if available, 8.1% answered ``no'', and 22.1% did not know. Only 13.4% stated that
using such a treatment would increase their alcohol consumption. The majority of 71.6% stated it would not
increase their alcohol consumption and 15.1% did not know. The follow-up survey was completed by N ¼ 471
participants, of which 11.9% stated consuming more alcohol, 70.3% reported not to drink more alcohol, and
17.8% did not know. Motives for not consuming more alcohol were ``The risk of having a hangover does not
influence my drinking behavior'' (24.2%), and ``alcohol is a harmful substance'' (20.3%).
Discussion: Social drinkers second the need for an effective hangover treatment. However, according to the vast
majority of them, the availability of an effective hangover treatment would not result in an increase of alcohol
consumption.

Introduction
Lack of research attention for the alcohol hangover has
resulted in the current absence of understanding of
the pathology of the alcohol hangover and the lack of
an effective treatment. Reviews note that the effective-
ness of the majority of hangover treatments that are
marketed has not been scientifically investigated.
Those treatments that have been examined show no or
little effectiveness, and the quality of most of these clin-
ical trials have been criticized (Stephens et al., 2014;
Verster and Penning, 2010). Although some products
have been shown to bring relieve to certain hangover
symptoms (e.g. reduce headache), other symptoms are
not alleviated. Hence, still today the only effective way to
prevent a hangover is to consume alcohol in moderation.
As the costs of hangovers are largely underesti-
mated, policy makers and health care campaigns have
not drawn much attention to the alcohol hangover. The
few studies that did try to calculate the socio-economic
costs of hangovers revealed that billions of dollars glo-
bally are lost annually due to absenteeism, reduced
productivity, and increased risk of injury (Frone,
2006; Gjerde et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Roche
et al., 2016, 2008). Recent studies also showed that
although during the hangover state driving is signifi-
cantly impaired (Verster et al., 2014a), yet most drivers

persist in driving while hungover (Verster et al., 2014b).
Given its costs and negative consequences, the need for
an effective hangover treatment is evident (Verster, 2012).
It is a persistent popular believe that the absence of
an effective hangover cure helps prevent drinkers from
consuming even more alcohol than they do already.
According to this viewpoint, drinking in moderation
is currently the only effective way to prevent hangover,
and this helps many drinkers limit excessive alcohol
use. Unfortunately, this popular belief has also been
adopted by many physicians and researchers. In this
context, researchers have suggested that having no
hangovers can be a gateway to alcohol dependence or
abuse (Rohsenow et al., 2012).
It could then be hypothesized that if drinkers experi-
ence less hangover symptoms they might drink more
alcohol. However, this is not supported by a recent
study that found hangover severity not to be signifi-
cantly correlated to the amount of alcohol consumed
or the achieved estimated peak blood alcohol concen-
tration (BAC) (Hogewoning et al., 2016). Moreover,
Huntley et al. (2015) examined the consequences of
having a hangover for drinking on future occasions.
They showed that more severe hangovers did not pre-
dict the likelihood of not drinking later that day.
However, they did find that the quantity of alcohol
consumed on that occasion was lower than usual con-
sumption levels. Other researchers reported that having
hangovers does not prevent drinkers from consuming
the same amounts of alcohol on future drinking occa-
sions (Mallett et al., 2006).
Taken together, the severity of intoxication or hang-
over effects seems unrelated to the actual amount of
alcohol consumed. Up to now, however, no research
has directly investigated if drinkers would consume
more alcohol if there was an effective and affordable
hangover treatment.
Given the lack of scientific data on the implications of
developing an effective hangover treatment, the current
study investigated whether drinkers who experience
hangovers would (a) be willing to buy an effective hang-
over treatment and (b) whether using such a product
would affect the amount of alcohol they consume.
Methods
In December 2016, an online survey was held among
Dutch students, 18­30 years old. The survey was
designed using www.surveymonkey.com and advertised
via www.facebook.com. Online informed consent was
obtained from all participants; no formal ethics
approval was required to conduct this research, accord-
ing to the Central Committee on Research Involving
Human Subjects (CCMO). As a reward for participat-
ing, subjects could win a 100 Euro gift voucher. Data
collection was conducted by NeuroClinics, and funded
by Sen-Jam Pharmaceutical. Unrestricted use of the
data was granted to the authors.
Demographic data on age, gender, and weight were
collected. Weekly alcohol consumption was recorded,
and the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed
the day before their latest past-month hangover.
Using a modified Widmark formula, taking into
account gender and drinking time, the estimated peak
BAC was calculated (Watson et al., 1981). Overall
hangover severity (i.e. a single one-item rating) and
the severity of 22 individual symptoms were rated on
an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 10
(extreme) (Hogewoning et al., 2016).
Subjects were asked whether they would buy an
effective hangover treatment if it was available. The
answering possibilities where ``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't
know'', and a text box was provided to leave com-
ments. Subjects were divided into three groups (``yes'',
``no'', and ``don't know'') according to their answer on
the question whether they would buy an effective hang-
over product, and alcohol consumption-related vari-
ables were compared using nonparametric statistics.
Next, subjects were asked whether they would con-
sume more alcohol if an effective hangover treatment
was available. Again, the answering possibilities where
``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't know'', and a text box was
provided to leave comments. Subjects were divided
into three groups (``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't know'')
according to their answer on the question whether
they would consume more alcohol. Alcohol consump-
tion-related variables of these three groups were com-
pared using nonparametric statistics.
In a follow-up survey, conducted one week after the
first survey, those subjects who left their email address
were contacted again and specifically asked via an
open-ended question to explain why they answered
``yes'', ``no'', or ``don't know'' to the two questions
posed in the first survey, i.e. (1) whether they would
buy an effective hangover treatment if it was available
and (2) whether they would consume more alcohol if an
effective hangover treatment was available.
Statistical analysis
Only those subjects aged 18 to 30 years old who
reported having a past-month hangover were included
in the analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted with
SPSS, version 24.
For demographic variables and hangover severity
scores, mean and standard deviation were computed.
Using Independent Samples Mann­Whitney U tests,
these variables we compared between those who
would buy an effective hangover cure, those who do
not know, and those who would not buy an effective

hangover cure. Using the same test, these variables were
also compared between those who state they would
consume more alcohol when an effective hangover
treatment was available, those who do not know,
and those who state that they would not consume
more alcohol.
Results
A total of 1837 subjects (50.4% men) who reported
having had an alcohol hangover recently completed
the survey. Their mean (SD) age was 20.8 (2.3) years
old, and they reported consuming 13.6 (10.1) alcoholic
beverages per week. Over a mean (SD) time period of
5.8 (2.0) hours of alcohol consumption, they reported
consuming 12.6 (5.5) alcoholic drinks on the day before
their latest alcohol hangover, which resulted in an esti-
mated peak BAC of 0.19 (0.1)%. Mean (SD) overall
hangover severity was 6.1 (1.9). The presence and sever-
ity of individual hangover symptoms is summarized in
Table 1.
Would you buy it?
When asked whether drinkers would buy an effective
hangover treatment was available, 69.9% answered yes.
A minority of 8.1% answered ``no'' and 22.0% did not
know. Demographics and hangover characteristics of
the three groups are summarized in Table 2.
The analyses revealed that buyers do not signifi-
cantly differ from non-buyers on weekly alcohol con-
sumption or the amount of alcohol consumed the
day before their latest hangover. However, buyers
do report a significantly higher overall hangover sever-
ity score when compared to non-buyers. Except for
vomiting and anxiety, buyers also score significantly
higher on each of the individual hangover symptom
severity scores.
Most commonly reported motives for buying an
effective hangover treatment were ``I suffer from
severe hangovers, so this product is welcome''
(40.5%) and ``it may help to be productive the day
after drinking'' (24.8%). Most commonly reported
motives for not buying an effective hangover treatment
were ``the hangover is a part of the drinking experience.
I have to bear the consequences'' (23.6%), ``I am afraid
I would drink more alcohol/the hangover prevents me
from drinking more alcohol'' (21.8%), ``I do not suffer
that much from hangovers'' (15.5%), and ``I do not
want to use chemical/synthetic products, only natural
treatments'' (12.7%). Those who did not made a choice
stated ``would only use it if adverse effects are known
and safety proven'' (32.2%), ``if the price of the product
is reasonable'' (13.6%), and ``I would only use it if the
product consists of natural ingredients'' (12.7%). As
these motives were voluntarily listed in a comment
box and not specifically asked for, the percentages
should be interpreted as illustrative only.
Impact on alcohol consumption
When asked whether drinkers would consume more
alcohol if an effective hangover treatment was available
only 13.4% answered ``yes''. The vast majority
answered ``no'' (71.6%) and 15.1% did not know.
A comparison between these three groups regarding
demographics, drinking characteristics, and hangover
experience is summarized in Table 3.
Drinkers who answered ``yes'' consumed signifi-
cantly less alcohol during the latest hangover session
when compared to drinkers who said ``no'' to the ques-
tion whether an effective hangover treatment would
increase their alcohol consumption (p ¼ 0.03, 12.1
versus 12.8 alcoholic drinks). Alternatively, drinkers
who answered ``yes'' report significantly more weekly
alcohol consumption when compared to drinkers who
said ``no'' to the question whether an effective hangover
treatment would increase their alcohol consumption
(p ¼ 0.05, 14.1 versus 13.7 alcoholic drinks). As the dif-
ferences are less than one alcoholic drink (À0.7 and
þ0.5 drink, respectively), the relevance of these differ-
ences is unclear.

No significant difference in overall hangover severity
was found between groups categorized with regard to
whether an effective hangover product would increase
their alcohol consumption. Also, severity of the major-
ity of hangover symptoms did not differ between those
who reported that they would consume more alcohol
and those who do not.
An invitation to take part in a follow-up survey was
send to N ¼ 950 of the participants (those who provided
their email in the original survey). Approximately half
of them completed the follow-up survey (N ¼ 471,
49.6%). Of these, N ¼ 56 (11.9%) reported they
would consume more alcohol if an effective hangover
treatment was available, N ¼ 331 (70.3%) reported they
would not drink more alcohol, and N ¼ 84 (17.8%) did
not know. The responses given by the follow-up sample
to the two questions did not differ significantly with
the answer distribution, gender, or age of the original
full sample that was surveyed. These participants were
specifically asked why they would or would not con-
sume more alcohol when an effective hangover treat-
ment was available.
Primary motives for consuming more alcohol if an
effective treatment was available were ``I currently
drink less alcohol because of the risk of having an
alcohol hangover'' (57.8%) and ``I currently drink less

(28.9%). For those stating not to consume more alco-
hol, main reasons were ``The risk of having a hangover

(10.9%), and ``I am happy with the amount of alcohol

if an effective hangover treatment will affect their drink-

hol if there are no negative consequences'' (18.3%), and
``because the hangover prevents excessive alcohol con-
sumption'' (15.1%).
Discussion
One of the ongoing concerns, regarding potential effect-
ive hangover treatment is the idea that drinkers may
increase their alcohol consumption once such a product
becomes available. The current study reveals, however,
that this concern may be unjustified. Although the vast
majority of social drinkers confirm that they are

interested in using such a product, at the same time they
attest that using it will not increase their alcohol
consumption.
From the analysis it became clear that the risk of
having a hangover does not appear to influence drink-
ing behavior. Drinkers did, however, attest that they
were not planning to increase their alcohol consump-
tion as alcohol is a harmful substance and they do not
want to become more drunk than they already are when
drinking. Alcohol consumption is viewed as part of a
social gathering and has the purpose to have a good
time. Hence, most drinkers are happy with the current
amount of alcohol they consume and have no reason to
increase this amount.
In contrast, those who state that a hangover cure
might make them drink more alcohol explained their
decision by the fact that they currently moderate their
alcohol consumption to prevent having a hangover,
including the risk of reduced productivity. This idea is
supported by drinkers who are unsure about the effect
on their drinking behavior who stated that an effective
hangover cure would make it tempting to increase their
alcohol consumption. Although one can argue that it is
a minority of drinkers who held these views, they still
represent a substantial number of drinkers.
When looking at the amount of alcohol consumed
prior to their latest hangover, all groups (hangover cure
buyers versus non-buyers and users versus non-users)
show comparable alcohol consumption levels (around
12 units, reaching an estimated peak BACs around
0.19%) that are significantly unhealthy. In terms of
prevention and education, this type of heavy alcohol
use deserves attention per se. The findings of this
study are supported by a recent naturalistic study
(Hogewoning et al., 2016) where similar amounts of
alcohol were consumed resulting in a comparable esti-
mated peak BAC. In general, for health reasons mod-
eration of alcohol consumption should be advocated,
and plans to further increase alcohol consumption
should be discouraged.
The study has several limitations that need to be
addressed. First, the sample that completed the survey
were young volunteers, aged 18 to 30 years old. While
this is a population that is overrepresented in those
indulging in heavy drinking and experiencing hang-
overs, it is not known from the current data if older
adults and elderly drinkers would have similar views.
Second, as we asked for respondents' intentions regard-
ing future behavior, the current data does not prove
that this behavior would actually materialize. In this
context it should be noted that the intentions of our
respondents contrasted with the observation made by
Huntley et al. (2015) who found reduced alcohol intake
the day after having a severe hangover. To further
investigate the potential protective effects of having
hangovers with regard to future alcohol intake, pro-
spective studies should be conducted to demonstrate
that the use of an effective hangover treatment would
indeed not affect drinking behavior of the vast majority
of social drinkers.
Finally, the data clearly show there is an interest for
an effective hangover treatment. The most mentioned
motives to buy such a product were to prevent experi-
encing hangover symptoms and to increase productiv-
ity the day after heavy alcohol consumption. Only 5%
of participants chose the option to prefer consuming
less alcohol as alternative means to prevent the alcohol
hangover and its functional consequences. Those who
said they would to buy a hangover treatment do not
differ in alcohol consumption or hangover experience
from those who were not interested in buying a hang-
over treatment. The latter implies that other factors
than alcohol consumption are important when
making this decision. In this regard, the willingness of
drinkers to use chemical or synthetic products as
opposed to natural products, pricing, and whether pos-
sible adverse effects of using the product are known and
its safety is proven were mentioned as relevant.
