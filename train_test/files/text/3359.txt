Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effects of a knowledge-attitude-behaviour health education model
on acquisition of disease-related knowledge and self-management behaviour by patients undergo-
ing maintenance haemodialysis.
Methods: Patients recently prescribed MHD were randomly assigned to a control group or an
intervention group. Control group patients were treated with usual care and general education
models. A specialist knowledge-attitude-behaviour health education model was applied to patients
in the intervention group.
Results: Eighty-six patients were included (n ¼ 43 per group). Before intervention, there were no
significant between-group differences in disease knowledge and self-management behaviour. After
6 months' intervention, a significant between-group difference in acquisition of disease knowledge
was observed. Self-management behaviour scores (control of body mass, reasonable diet, correct
drug intake, physical activity, correct fistula care, disease condition monitoring, psychological and
social behaviours) for the intervention group were also higher than those for the control group.
Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that the knowledge-attitude-behaviour model
appears to be a valuable tool for the health education of MHD patients.

Introduction
The knowledge-attitude-behaviour model
modifies human health-related behaviours
by dividing changes into three continuous
processes: knowledge acquisition, belief
generation and behaviour formation.1,2
Research has indicated that correlations
between information level and overt behav-
iour (and between attitude and overt behav-
iour) are generally positive, albeit slight.1
When the knowledge-attitude-behaviour
model was applied to HIV screening of
women in India (a country where over
1000 babies are infected with HIV each
year), and to knowledge of dental treatment
of patients with HIV, dramatic improve-
ments in knowledge, attitude and reported
behaviour were demonstrated.2,3 Thus,
knowledge acquisition, belief generation
and behaviour formation are important
aspects for improving patient health.
Maintenance haemodialysis (MHD)
increases the survival rate of patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and in
China MHD is now widely prescribed
for such patients.4 Correspondingly, the
number of MHD patients in China
increased from 94 per million population
in 2007 to 147.3 per million population in
2010.5 However, few Chinese patients on
MHD achieve their therapeutic target, par-
ticularly regarding blood pressure control,
anaemia correction and mineral balance.6
Furthermore, MHD patients may also
experience psychological, physical or emo-
tional stress as a result of disease-associated
lifestyle changes. As a chronic condition,
ESRD has an extended time period during
which patients must learn to cope with life
changes; this makes health education and
self-management behaviours key factors in
assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic
interventions.7 Thus, achieving adequate
haemodialysis, ­ and providing subjective
and initiative activities for patients that
enhance their self-management abilities ­
are key to reducing the occurrence of
complications, and for maintaining a satis-
factory health-related quality-of-life in those
undergoing MHD.7
The present study hypothesized that
application of the knowledge-attitude-beha-
viour model would positively affect health
beliefs, facilitate changes in bad habits,
enhance healthy behavior, and improve
self-management behaviour and outcome
in patients on MHD.7
To date, no studies have investigated the
relationship between knowledge, attitude
and behaviour changes for MHD patients.
Therefore, the objectives of the present
study were to explore the effects of
a knowledge-attitude-behaviour health
education model on the acquisition of
disease-related knowledge, then to assess
subsequent self-management behaviour in
MHD patients.
Methods
Patients
Patients prescribed MHD between October
2011 and May 2012 at the Second Affiliated
Hospital of Harbin Medical University were
randomly selected for this study.1 These
patients fulfilled the criteria for chronic
kidney disease classification standard stage
5 (renal failure) established by the United
States Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney
Disease and Dialysis in Clinical Practice
Guidelines Expert Group.8 In addition,
patients met the following study inclusion
criteria: indicated for MHD; !18 years of
age; MHD duration >3 months; MHD
regularly scheduled (two or three times
weekly); stable clinical condition; patient
could read and understand the question-
naire supplied.
558 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
Stable MHD patients were defined as
those with sufficient solute clearance by
haemodialysis, a low water load (<3%),
good control of blood glucose and blood
pressure (<140/90 mm Hg), haemoglobin
concentration ! 100­120 g/l, no adverse car-
diac events and no recent infections.
Exclusion criteria included severe cognitive
dysfunction, patients who could not take
care of themselves after renal transplant-
ation and patients with serious cardiovascu-
lar and cerebrovascular disease.
Randomization
Patients were randomly divided into one of
two main study groups, using computer-
generated random numbers that were
assigned according to enrollment order.
Patients receiving odd numbers were
assigned to the control group; patients
receiving even numbers were assigned to
the intervention group. A nurse (J.W.) with
extensive clinical skills, professional know-
ledge and experience in mental health nur-
sing was used to record patient data.
Control group
Routine health education information cover-
ing diet, medication, exercise, monitoring,
prevention and treatment of complications,
as well as other measures, was given to each
participant in this group. Blood pressure,
body weight, urine output, ultrafiltration,
fluid intake amount and any complications
were recorded for each patient. Standard oral
education and health education materials were
used. Patient follow-up was by oral commu-
nication, scheduled once every 2 weeks.
Intervention group
The knowledge-attitude-behaviour health
education model was applied to the inter-
vention group. Initially, a questionnaire9­11
was completed by each patient.
Following completion of the question-
naire, patients received definitive informa-
tion and education, including written
materials, lectures and time to talk with the
nursing staff (discussed below). This disease-
related information included the purpose of
haemodialysis, principles of haemodialysis,
important aspects of haemodialysis, protec-
tion of internal fistulae, prevention of com-
plications and emergency treatment.
According to the three stages of Kelman's
change of attitude theory,12 discussions were
conducted every 2 weeks.
Patients in the intervention group were
subdivided into five groups, each of approxi-
mately the same size, to enhance changes in
their marginal beliefs and to achieve more
focused and consistent health beliefs.
Data analyses
The following analyses were undertaken
only in the intervention group.
Synchronized analysis and data sorting
were conducted according to each patient's
level of education, and health education
understanding. The three nursing models
of knowledge-attitude-behaviour were then
used to conduct disease-related knowledge
education, training of health beliefs and
supportive health behaviour.13
Survey results were analysed by a spe-
cialist (L.L.) to understand the physical and
mental aspects of each patient and the
patient's family social status, so that areas
for improvement and the support structure
involved could be identified.
Communication with patients and
their families
Effective communication with patients in the
intervention group and their family mem-
bers included in-depth interviews (telephone
and face-to-face interviews), to develop a
trusting relationship. This relationship was
intended to provide patients and their family
Liu et al. 559
members with support for problems.
Telephone hotlines (manned by healthcare
professionals) were also opened, to encour-
age interactive education between patients.
Active management of health behaviours
A stage-by-stage system (Figure 1) was used
to train patients in the intervention group to
actively manage their own disease and adopt
correct health behaviours. Educational
materials on dialysis were distributed to
patients. In addition, lectures on MHD
were held, and patients received individua-
lized information and support if necessary.
An advisory panel of experienced phys-
icians and experts in haemodialysis was
established to conduct self-management
training and facilitate discussions among
participants. The following topics were
addressed, using health education methods
suitable for the cultural and learning cap-
acity of the patients involved.
Disease-related knowledge education. The
objective and principle were presented and
issues that need attention, such as protection
of internal fistulae and prevention and
emergency treatment of common complica-
tions were conveyed.
Dietary knowledge. This included discussion
on the need to limit salt intake to <3 g of salt
per day, to reduce thirst. Foods and flavour-
ings that were high in salt were specified,
including pickled products, chicken powder
and monosodium glutamate. The need to
restrict the volume of water and sodium
ingested was covered, as was the need to
control weight gain. Adhering to a strict diet
and liquid intake regimen represents a key
challenge for haemodialysis patients.14
Psychological and social behaviours. These
behaviours were supported by patients
being advised to talk frequently with coun-
sellors, to eliminate or reduce negative
moods. In addition, patients were encour-
aged to seek the psychological support that
was available, in order for them to establish
and sustain the confidence needed to
manage their chronic disease.
Self inspection index. Patients and their
families were encouraged to purchase hae-
matomanometers and were then taught to
obtain correct blood pressure measure-
ments. Family members were also advised
to maintain daily health diaries for the
patient. These diaries included the following
parameters: body weight; heart rate; blood

pressure; respiratory pattern; urinary
volume; retention levels of sodium and
water. Family members also learned to
observe the patient for signs of oedema,
with obvious short-term weight gain indicat-
ing excessive water load. In addition to
measurements of body weight, oedema in
the leg, foot, hand, upper limb and lumbo-
sacral portion were to be noted.
Physical activity and behaviour
intervention. These were encouraged.
Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise was
conducted regularly, using step-by-step and
perseverance principles. Types of exercise
advocated included Qigong, Taijiquan, jog-
ging, cycling, swimming and/or walking
three to five times each week, with each
exercise period lasting 20­30 min.
Arteriovenous fistula care. It was important to
ensure that this vascular access was used
properly and maintained carefully to extend
its use as long as possible. Patients and their
families were shown proper fistula nursing
methods, including preparing the arm before
dialysis, not using the fistula side limb to lift
heavy items, nor for drawing blood, blood
pressure measurement, injections or infusions.
Patients were taught to self detect the anasto-
motic murmur of the fistula and the associated
`trill' sound each day. Fistula smoothness was
also recorded using touch or a stethoscope.
If the vascular trill disappeared and a throb
was not found at the anastomosis site, patients
were advised that their internal fistula was
blocked and were told to attend the hospital
for diagnosis and treatment.
Medication use. Patients received close
instruction in how to take their prescribed
medications at the times indicated. Drugs
associated with renal injury, such as genta-
micin and certain Chinese traditional medi-
cines, were prohibited. Drug effects and
adverse reactions were monitored; routine
blood tests and blood biochemistry were
assayed regularly using standard methods.
Test results were monitored to assure an
adequate level of dialysis.
Patient follow-up was conducted once
every 2 weeks to assess intervention effects
(using structured questionnaires).9­11
Medical behaviours that were not in com-
pliance with the directions of each patient's
doctor were analysed and intervention
schemes were adjusted accordingly.
Evaluation of intervention methods
Intervention methods were evaluated in
both study groups initially by assessing the
patient's grasp of disease knowledge using a
questionnaire9 that included seven aspects
and 20 items. This questionnaire was scored
using a range between 0 and 3 points
(0, absence of understanding; 1 partial
understanding; 2 having a majority of cor-
rect answers; 3 complete understanding).
Self-management behaviour was evaluated
with parameters of chronic disease self
management,10,11 including diet manage-
ment, psychological and social behaviours,
oral drug compliance, disease condition
monitoring, physical activity, arteriovenous
fistula care and body quality control.15
Twenty items that addressed these aspects
were evaluated and analysed.
The results obtained had good reliability,
Cronbach's a coefficient was 0.89 and the
retest reliability value was 0.83. Results were
ranked using Likert class 4 scoring (1, never
done; 2, occasionally done; 3, basically
done; 4, completely done).
Since there were different numbers of
items for each aspect of the self-management
models, data were transformed into 10 fen
models of scoring so that each aspect was
comparable with others. An overall self-
management behaviour score was obtained
by averaging the scores of all the different
aspects. The higher the score, the better the
self-management behaviour exhibited by the
patient.

Questionnaires were completed by
participants in the intervention group
prior to intervention and at 6 months
postintervention.
Ethical considerations
Approval for this study was obtained from
the institutional review committee of Harbin
Medical University, Harbin, China. Written
informed consent was obtained from
all patients according to the Declaration of
Helsinki, prior to their assignation to a
group.
Sample size
Since no similar studies have investigated
the relationship between knowledge-atti-
tude-behaviour changes in MHD patients,
the sample size was roughly estimated based
on the following parameters prior to the
trial: a ¼ 0.05, b ¼ 0.10, d ¼ 1 and s ¼ 1.18.
The value of n for the present study was 30.
A 20% rate of incomplete or invalid data
was also considered, based on previous
experience. Therefore, a sample size of
n > 36 per group was considered appropriate
to achieve the study objectives.
Statistical analyses
Data were reported as meanÆ SD. Statistical
significance between the means was deter-
mined and analysed using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), V2-test, Student's t-test
or paired t-test as appropriate, using SPSSÕ
version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
A P-value< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant, and a P-value< 0.01 was con-
sidered highly significant.
Results
In total, 91 patients were prescribed MHD
between October 2011 and May 2012 at the
Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
Medical University. Eighty six of these
patients were eligible for participation in
this study in this study (n ¼ 43 per group).
Figure 2 provides an overview of the study
conduct.
Disease-related knowledge pre- and
postintervention
There were no statistical differences between
patients' ages, sex, degree of education,
body weight, duration of dialysis or cause
of dialysis for those in the control group
versus those in the intervention group
(Table 1). In addition, there was no obvious
difference in the extent of disease-related
knowledge for each group prior to interven-
tion. However, at 6 months postinterven-
tion, disease-related knowledge scores were
significantly higher for patients in the inter-
vention group, compared with their baseline
levels, and also compared with scores
observed in the control group (P < 0.05 in
each case; Table 2).
Self-management behaviours pre- and
postintervention
Self-management behaviour scores for the
control and intervention groups did not
show a significant difference prior to
intervention (P > 0.05). However, self-
management behaviour scores for both
groups were significantly higher after, com-
pared with before, intervention (P < 0.05).
Furthermore, postintervention scoring for
the intervention group was higher than that
for the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 3).
Discussion
People requiring MHD face psychological
and physical pressures that impact substan-
tially on health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). In addition, once patients begin
MHD, they rely on such treatment for their
survival.
562 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
The objective of the self-management
model applied in this study was to provide
MHD patients with the ability to cope with,
and hopefully resolve, common problems
associated with control of ESRD symptoms,
compliance with a treatment programme
and somatic discomfort. Health education
is an important external factor that
influences self-management behaviour,15
although a further study16 found that self-
management education that simply pro-
vided information only produced a slight
improvement in self-management behaviour
in patients. The present study showed that,
despite receiving health education, behav-
iours associated with poor self management
continued to be observed in patients.
A strong motivation to maintain good
health was key to patients realizing the
benefits and necessity of treatment, thereby
improving overall self-management.
The knowledge-attitude-behaviour
model considers that knowledge is essential
for effecting changes in behaviour, and that
individuals can obtain knowledge and skills
through learning. Accordingly, patients and
their families need to actively receive know-
ledge, which can lead to a gradual develop-
ment of healthy beliefs and attitudes that are
reinforced with the adoption of healthy
behaviours. Ren, et al.13 and Zhao, et al.17
demonstrated that application of the knowl-
edge-attitude-behaviour model effectively
established a healthy belief in patients and

led to the conversion of bad living habits to
healthy behaviours. In the present study,
knowledge was provided to the intervention
group at health lectures and through the
distribution of educational materials. The
accessibility of this knowledge was intended
to improve the recognition of health-related
behaviours. Both the examiner and the
patient analysed the patient's condition
and self-evaluation in order to establish
healthcare and rehabilitation objectives.
Bad habits associated with self care were
highlighted so that they could be eliminated;
patients were encouraged to adopt a regular
medication regimen that effectively con-
trolled ESRD progression and promoted
an improvement in self-management behav-
iour. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency of the
patients we studied was found to be
enhanced when patient cases were analysed
and discussed, and when mutual help groups
were established. Ideally, the goal for each
patient should be to maximize their self-
confidence, thereby encouraging them to
participate in decisions regarding their
health and self-management.
There was no significant difference in the
extent of disease-related knowledge between
the intervention group and the control
group prior to intervention, indicating that
patients in these groups were comparable.
Patients could acquire disease-related know-
ledge from each intervention programme;
however, a greater level of disease-related
knowledge was obtained by the intervention
group than the control group (P < 0.05).
These results suggest that patients can
acquire effective self-management know-
ledge and skills following systematic guid-
ance and training according to education
levels. Moreover, a higher level of disease
education can be gained by both patients
and their families with effective application
of a knowledge-attitude-behaviour initia-
tive. Family members were encouraged to
participate in study activities including
attending informative lectures on haemodi-
alysis, answering relative knowledge inqui-
ries, studying dialysis educational materials
and discussing effective communication with
patients. In the present study, this led to a
correction of lifestyle habits, enhanced

self-monitoring, improvement in mood and
good levels of patient participation in their
individual self-management regimen.
Self-management intervention not only
aims to provide patients with information,
but more importantly, helps patients to
master self-management skills. In this way,
behaviour changes are enhanced, which is
key to attaining and sustaining management
objectives for patients.18
Patients on MHD experience the pres-
sures of the disease and its treatment, but
also may exhibit psychosocial traits, and
have poor compliance with recommended
diets, liquid intake restrictions and medica-
tion regimens.19 Unfortunately, when self-
management behaviour compliance is com-
promised, there are severe consequences,
including a decrease in HRQoL and an
increased potential for MHD to become
less effective. Patients who monitor their
physical state using effective self-manage-
ment methods and skills can eventually
attain a satisfactory HRQoL.16
While receiving MHD, patients need to
maintain adequate self-management behav-
iours.20 Self-management behaviour was
previously defined as the acquisition of
MHD knowledge, such that health object-
ives are actively achieved and HRQoL
improves.21 Health knowledge is available
from lectures, consultants, individualized

instruction and participation in discussion
groups. In comparison, traditional health
education includes a process of disease
recognition and requires subsequent
changes in behaviour to improve clinical
outcome.22 Patients' perception of their
health, self-management attitude and ways
of coping with disease are important factors
that affect patient compliance and self-
management behaviour. Therefore, it is
hypothesized that effective health education
will increase compliance, thereby controlling
disease recurrence and HRQoL.
Knowledge-attitude-behaviour theory is
an extension of cognitive theory applica-
tion in health education. Knowledge-
attitude-behaviour theory proposes that
health knowledge and information are the
foundation for establishing active and cor-
rect beliefs and attitudes towards disease;
such attitudes are the driving forces for
modifying patient behaviour.18 Research
has demonstrated that important correl-
ations exist between the occurrence, devel-
opment and prognosis of diseases.22
Psychological, dietary, exercise and lifestyle
interventions can positively or negatively
contribute to disease recurrence.
Improvements in health knowledge and the
development of good health skills are
important for enhancing patient health.23
Self management needs to emphasize the
patient's recognition of their own prob-
lems.24 Ideally, both the health care

professional and the patient should recog-
nize the health problems that exist and the
issues of most concern to the patient. With
this recognition, relevant issues can be
addressed using self-management skills.
Overall, the objective of the self-manage-
ment model is not to cure diseases, but
rather to ensure that the patient's state of
health and function are satisfactorily
maintained so that they can achieve an
independent and healthy lifestyle. When
self-management models have been applied
to the prevention and control of chronic
diseases, significant and positive effects on
the patient's HRQoL, disease management
and treatment compliance have been
observed.25 In combination, these measures
resulted in improvements in patient
survival.25
In the present study, self-management
behaviour scores for the intervention group
were significantly higher than those rec-
orded prior to intervention and than those
of the control group (Table 3). These data
indicate that self-management knowledge
was instilled into patients, and that behav-
iour guidance was achieved following an
understanding of the dynamic changes that
occur with application of the knowledge-
attitude-behaviour model of nursing inter-
vention. Moreover, this approach increased
patients' health awareness, and led to cor-
rections in unhealthy lifestyles and behav-
iours. These patients also followed their
doctor's advice better, sustained a reason-
able diet and strictly controlled both water
and salt intake, compared with those in the
control group. Such changes led to a
decrease in the complications reported, an
improvement in self-management behav-
iour, and a reduction in the obstacles
to self-management encountered by the
patient. Thus, disease control and allevi-
ation of disease was achieved. Furthermore,
these positive effects support the wide-
spread application of the knowledge-
attitude-behaviour model.
To conclude, application of the knowl-
edge-attitude-behaviour model in health
education has the potential to facilitate
changes in bad habits, to enhance healthy
behaviour and to improve self-management
behaviour in patients undergoing MHD.
Our preliminary findings need to be con-
firmed in larger studies.
