Abstract
This paper presents evidence on the industry effects of bank lending in Germany and identifies
the industry effects of bank lending associated with changes in monetary policy and industry-
specific bank credit demand. To this end, we estimate individual bank lending functions for
13 manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries and five banking groups using quarterly
bank balance sheet and bank lending data for the period 1992:1-2002:4. The evidence from
dynamic panel data models shows that industry-specific bank lending growth predominantly
responds to changes in industry-specific bank credit demand rather than to changes in monet-
ary policy. In fact, conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of monetary policy are very
sensitive to the choice of industry. The empirical results lend strong support to the existence
of industry effects of bank lending. Because industries are a prominent source of variation
in the bank lending effects of bank credit demand and monetary policy, the paper concludes
that the industry composition of bank credit portfolios is an important determinant of bank
lending growth and monetary policy effectiveness.

Non-Technical Summary
There is an ongoing debate about the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy changes
in Europe. An important role is hereby assigned to the credit channel of monetary policy
transmission that emphasizes the monetary policy response of bank lending. Existing studies
on the bank lending effects of monetary policy in Germany assume that industry-specific bank
credit growth does not differ between industries. In our view, however, a distinction of bank
lending by industry is important since cyclical and structural differences between industries
have a potentially strong effect on bank credit growth. The present paper shows that such
'industry effects' primarily reflect bank credit demand effects. Using the industry dimension
of microeconomic bank lending data and information on the industry composition of bank
credit portfolios, the present paper investigates the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in
bank credit demand and monetary policy in Germany.
In order to determine the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand and
monetary policy, we specify dynamic panel data models along the lines suggested in Ehrmann
et al. (2003) and Worms (2003). The empirical models are defined for 13 industry sectors
and 5 banking groups. The banking group and industry dimension of the data permits the
identification of bank lending effects, which result from banking group specific differences in
the industry composition of bank credit portfolios.
The empirical analysis shows that bank credit growth predominantly responds to changes
in industry-specific factors. Strong effects arise from industry-specific output growth and
industry-specific inflation. Banking group effects are weak in comparison to industry effects.
The effect of monetary policy changes on industry-specific bank lending differs between in-
dustries. The sensitivity of bank lending to changes in monetary policy hence depends on the
structure of bank credit portfolios.

Industries and the Bank Lending Effects of Bank Credit Demand
and Monetary Policy in Germany1
1 Introduction
Existing research emphasizes the importance of the interest rate and credit channel as propa-
gation and amplification mechanisms of monetary policy changes. Both types of transmission
channels predict bank lending to change in response to monetary policy actions. While the
direction of the change is the same in the credit and interest rate view, the underlying reasons
differ. The credit channel view explains monetary-policy-induced movements in bank lending
with changes in bank loan supply, whereas the interest rate channel stresses changes in bank
loan demand. Apparently, the correlation of monetary policy shocks with loan demand and
loan supply and the consequent role of interest rates as joint determinant of credit demand
and credit supply precludes the unique identification of the interest rate and credit channel
effects of monetary policy.
In order to identify the loan supply effects of monetary policy, empirical studies typically rely
on disaggregated macro- or microeconomic data. These illustrate the distributional effects of
monetary policy by stressing the within-group and between-group heterogeneity of banks in
terms of asset size (e.g., Kashyap and Stein, 1995), liquidity (e.g., Kashyap and Stein, 2000),
and capitalization (e.g., Peek and Rosengren, 1995). When stressing bank characteristics,
the identification of bank credit supply effects rests on several assumptions. Firstly, it is
assumed that bank heterogeneity in bank size, liquidity, and capitalization reflects cross-bank
differences in the severity of asymmetric information problems and consequently differences in
the ability of banks to offset monetary-policy-induced changes in deposits with other types of
finance. Cross-bank differences in bank characteristics are not allowed to reflect differences in
bank customers. Secondly, the response of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand is
assumed to be homogenous across all banks.2 Thirdly, banks are assumed to serve customers

which do not differ in terms of bank credit demand. These are strong assumptions and their
potential violation suggests the persistence of the identification problem.
The identification bias is likely to be particularly strong for Germany for two reasons. The
first reason refers to the housebank principle in German banking. German banks belong
to banking groups which confine their business to customers which differ in the degree of
bank dependence: commercial banks are the housebank to large corporations and savings
and cooperative banks are the housebanks to small- and medium-sized firms.3 Small firms
tend to be more dependent on banks as source of external finance than large firms. The
greater bank dependence results from credit market imperfections, which are more severe
for small than for large firms given that reporting and accounting standards become more
stringent with firm size. Credit market imperfections therefore cause the portfolio of savings
and cooperative banks to be biased towards bank-dependent firms and that of commercial
banks to be biased towards firms with access to non-bank sources of finance (cf. Deutsche
Bundesbank, 1998a, 2002a). In view of these relationships, banking groups are likely to differ
in the extent to which they (i) face changes in credit demand and (ii) adjust credit supply.
The second reason refers to the existence of pronounced cross-industry differences in credit
demand. The Deutsche Bundesbank (1996) attributes these to heterogeneities in the cycli-
cal and structural characteristics of industries. The cyclicality of industry output affects the
need for external finance through its impact on the availability of internal funds of finance.
Cross-industry differences in bank credit demand reflect dissimilarities in the amplitude and
frequency of cyclical fluctuations and in the sensitivity of cash flows to cyclical demand
changes. Structural characteristics such as the degree of capital intensity, firm size distribu-
tion, or openness to trade emphasize industry differences (i) in the costs of maintaining and
expanding production structures and (ii) in the severity of credit market imperfections as
source of differences in credit demand.
Existing studies on the bank lending effects of monetary policy primarily assume that bank
credit demand does not differ between debtors in general and industries in particular. The un-
derlying analyses involve the estimation of bank lending functions for the aggregate economy,
where macroeconomic aggregates approximate credit demand.4 Although the macroeconomic
data are useful since they are available for long time periods at relatively high frequencies,
the underlying models only illustrate the bank lending effects of credit demand changes for
the average industry. Differences in credit demand across industries are ignored. In addition,
macroeconomic data do not control for possible differences in the monetary policy response
the bank lending effects of monetary policy in chapter 2. This is comparable to the credit channel assumption
that the interest rate sensitivity of credit demand does not depend on firm size.

large firms in Germany.

of industry-specific bank lending. The effectiveness of monetary policy is thus considered to
be independent of the industry structure of bank credit portfolios. Furthermore, most studies
do not account for possible cross-banking group differences in the response of bank lending to
changes in bank credit demand or monetary policy. Instead, they typically provide evidence
for an aggregate measure of all banks, disregarding cross-banking group effects.5
In our view, however, knowledge regarding the industry effects and banking group effects
of bank lending is important as the results illustrate whether the effectiveness of monetary
policy depends on the industry composition of bank credit portfolios and on the institutional
setting of the banking system. The results may help to anticipate the effect of banking sector
consolidation and industry specialization on future monetary policy efficacy. This paper is
motivated by these considerations. We do not impose the assumption of homogenous bank
credit demand, but use the industry dimension of bank lending data to identify the response
of bank credit supply to changes in industry-specific bank credit demand and monetary policy
in Germany. We do not only compile evidence for the aggregate banking sector. Instead, we
distinguish the savings banking group and the sub-groups of the credit cooperative banking
sector in order to identify the bank lending effects which are due to cross-banking group
differences in the industry composition of bank credit portfolios. We hypothesize that in-
dustries and banking groups determine the response of bank lending to changes in bank
credit demand and monetary policy. In particular, we argue that changes in bank lending are
industry-specific and that the industry composition of a bank's loan portfolio determines the
effectiveness of monetary policy through credit channel effects.
We discuss two questions. Firstly, are changes in the industry-specific volume of bank credit
explained by bank lending effects of monetary policy or do they reflect changes in industry-
specific bank credit demand?6 Secondly, does the sensitivity of bank lending to changes in
monetary policy or bank credit demand differ between industries or between banking groups?
We address these problems for Germany using the Bundesbank database on bank lending and
bank balance sheet information. The answer to these questions will show that industry bank
lending predominantly responds to changes in industry bank credit demand rather than to
monetary policy changes. Furthermore, the results lend very strong support to the existence
of industry effects of bank lending, whereas banking group effects are comparatively weak.
Evidence in favor of credit channel effects of monetary policy crucially depends on the choice
of industry and banking group. In view of these findings, we conclude that empirical studies
which do not control for the industry structure of bank credit provide an incomplete view on
the bank lending effects of bank credit demand and monetary policy. The underlying results
5The notable exceptions are K¨
uppers (2001) and Kakes and Sturm (2002) who distinguish banking groups
in empirical studies for Germany.
6Throughout this paper, we cannot control for the response of bank lending to monetary-policy-induced
changes in credit demand. However, to the extent that monetary policy affects industry output or industry
price only with a lag, changes in the volume of bank loans can still predominantly be attributed to changes
in bank credit demand. Also see section 7 for additional caveats of the present empirical analysis.

only reflect the impact of the average industry. However, neglecting banking group effects is
unlikely to affect the overall conclusions as to the determinants of bank lending.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing evidence on the credit
channel effects of monetary policy via bank lending in Germany. Section 3 describes the
German banking industry. Within this framework, the discussion stresses the balance sheet
structure of the main banking groups and the industry structure of the corresponding loan
portfolios. Section 4 discusses the empirical model and the empirical estimation strategy.
Section 5 presents the industry and bank data and describes the bank outlier detection pro-
cedure. Section 6 reports the empirical results from dynamic panel estimations and robustness
checks. We will ask whether differences in the response of bank lending to changes in bank
credit demand and monetary policy are explained by effects associated with banking groups
or industries. We conclude in section 7.
2 The Credit Channel Effects of Monetary Policy in Germany
This section reviews the existing empirical evidence on the bank lending effects of monetary
policy. Common to the existing studies is that they typically do not determine the response of
bank lending to changes in bank credit demand.7 When studies control for the bank lending
effects of bank credit demand, they do not allow bank credit demand to differ between
different types of customers.8 Given the lack of evidence on the response of bank lending
to changes in bank credit demand, this section primarily analyzes the existing evidence with
respect to the bank lending effects of monetary policy.
There is a wide range of studies on the bank lending effects of monetary policy in Europe.
Because individual firm and bank-level data are only available to a limited extent, the empirical
investigations largely rely on aggregate data.9 Aggregate studies can be criticized for providing
an incomplete view on the bank lending effects of monetary policy because they only identify
the monetary policy response of bank lending associated with the average bank and average
debtor. Empirical studies with disaggregated lending data provide more insights on monetary
policy transmission since they distinguish the monetary policy response of the individual
components of bank lending. The corresponding evidence in, for example, Dale and Haldane
(1995), Barran, Coudert, and Mojon (1997), Kakes, Sturm, and Maier (2001), K¨
uppers
(2001), Kakes and Sturm (2002), and De Haan (2003) points to the sensitivity of the results
to the type of bank loan and to the choice of banking group.
7Dale and Haldane (1995) implicitly allow for differences in bank credit demand between the corporate
and household sector. Unfortunately, the analysis does not identify the response of bank lending to changes
in bank credit demand.
8See, for example Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003).
9See, for example, Guender and Moersch (1997), Garretsen and Swank (1998), Holtem¨
oller (2003),
H¨
ulsewig, Winker, and Worms (2004), and H¨
ulsewig, Mayer, and Wollmersh¨
auser (2005).

While studies using disaggregated data allow for more detail on the determinants of bank
lending, they still provide an incomplete view. This is because they identify the bank lending
effects of monetary policy by exploiting the between-group but not the within-group dissim-
ilarities of agents and markets. For example, Kakes and Sturm (2002) capture differences
in bank size by estimating separate models for different banking groups. The corresponding
evidence allows for behavioral asymmetries between different banking groups, but not be-
tween banks within each banking group. In contrast to macroeconomic and disaggregated
studies, microeconomic studies exploit heterogeneities within samples to identify the bank
credit demand and the bank credit supply effects of monetary policy.
Many microeconomic studies for European countries including Germany build on BankScope
data (cf. De Bondt, 1998; Favero, Giavazzi, and Flabbi, 1999; Altunba¸
s, Fazylov, and
Molyneux, 2002).10 Although the corresponding studies employ similar data, they differ in
their conclusions regarding the credit channel effects of monetary policy in Germany: credit
channel effects through bank lending are particular to De Bondt (1998), but do not prevail
in Favero, Giavazzi, and Flabbi (1999) and Altunba¸
s, Fazylov, and Molyneux (2002). The
results hence appear to be sensitive to the choice of estimation method and sample period.
Besides this aspect, the evidence from BankScope data is also subject to a large sample bias.
In order to avoid this bias, Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003) use microeconomic data
compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Both studies empirically account for the response of
bank lending growth to changes in bank lending demand and monetary policy by estimating
dynamic panel models using bank-specific bank asset size, liquidity, and capitalization as loan
supply proxy variables and macroeconomic measures of economic activity as loan demand
variables. The evidence from both studies points to the transmission of monetary policy
shocks through bank lending, although cross-study differences prevail as to the source of bank
distributional effects. Ehrmann et al. (2003) stress cross-bank differences in liquidity, while
Worms (2003) emphasizes cross-bank heterogeneities in liquidity and capitalization. Worms
(2003) shows that bank size per se only captures cross-bank differences in the bank lending
effects of monetary policy when the analysis controls for short-term interbank deposits. As
regards loan demand factors, Ehrmann et al. (2003) find bank lending to respond to inflation,
but not to output growth. Worms (2003), in contrast, documents a positive response of bank
lending growth to an increase in real output and hence bank credit demand.
To summarize, existing studies report ambiguous results regarding the bank lending effects of
monetary policy in Germany. The ambiguity prevails for micro- as well as for macroeconomic
analyses. Furthermore, existing empirical studies differ in the cross-sectional dimension of
the estimations. Some studies only exploit a single data dimension and divide the banking
sample by either bank size, bank liquidity, or bank capitalization. Other studies also split
the sample along a second dimension, using the maturity of bank credit, the banking group,
10We only refer to those studies which contain Germany. See Angeloni, Kashyap, and Mojon (2003) for a
compilation of microeconomic studies that document the credit channel effects of monetary policy in European
countries.

or the group of debtors as additional model criterion. Among the existing studies, only
Worms (2003) controls for a possible industry bias in bank lending. However, he models the
interdependence between loan supply and industry indirectly by including a weighed average
of real sectoral output as measure of bank credit demand. The resulting estimates do not
allow for inferences as to the industry-specific effects of bank lending and as to the response
of bank lending to industry-specific changes in bank credit demand.
A common caveat applies to the existing empirical studies. When identifying the bank
lending effects of monetary policy, the empirical literature does not control for the observation
that the identification of the bank credit supply effects is not only complicated by possible
heterogeneities in bank credit demand and in the response of bank lending to changes in bank
credit demand, but also by the balance sheet effects of monetary policy. The complication
arises because balance sheet effects cause the volume of bank lending to be simultaneously
determined by bank credit supply and bank credit demand side effects. The supply side
effects are at the core of the credit channel theory of monetary policy transmission. This
theory argues that the balance sheet (net worth) position of potential borrowers such as firms
influences the credit supply decisions of banks. For example, bank credit supply is predicted
to decline in response to a monetary contraction given the associated deterioration in the
balance sheet position of firms (cf. Bernanke and Gertler, 1989).11
In contrast to bank credit supply, a monetary-policy-induced decline in net worth has an
ambiguous effect on bank credit demand: it may expand or contract. On the one hand, firms
may demand more bank credit in order to be able to finance fixed and inventory investment
and to preserve liquidity. On the other hand, firms may not change or even reduce bank credit
demand in the wake of a monetary contraction. This response requires firms to be swift in
adjusting production to the monetary-policy-induced decline in output demand so as to reduce
the variable costs of production and to avoid the costs associated with undesired inventory
accumulation. In addition, bank credit demand may decline when firms delay physical capital
investment in anticipation of lower future interest rates.
Overall, the balance sheet effect of monetary policy causes bank credit supply to contract,
while bank credit demand may expand or contract. Unfortunately, we can only stress this
caveat. Similar to existing studies, the present analysis cannot identify the balance sheet
effects on bank credit supply or bank credit demand. However, this shortcoming is not
expected to affect our conclusions regarding the bank supply effects of monetary policy given
that existing empirical research lends no or weak support to the existence of balance sheet
effects of monetary policy in Germany. Evidence against the existence of balance sheet effects
is provided by Siegfried (2000), Mojon, Smets, and Vermeulen (2002), Chatelain et al. (2003),
and Arnold and Vrugt (2004). Von Kalckreuth (2003) reports supportive evidence. However,
the balance sheet effect of monetary policy is small.
11Also see Trautwein (2000) for a literature review on the balance sheet effects of monetary policy and on
the relationship between a firm's balance sheet position and its access to bank credit.

3 Banks and Industries in Germany: An Overview
In order to provide the framework for the subsequent discussion, this section describes the
German banking system.12 To this end, we compile quarterly data from the monthly bank
balance sheet statistics and the quarterly borrower statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank for
the period 1992:1-2002:4. Section 5 and appendix A describe the data in detail. We are
specifically interested in the balance sheet structure of the main banking groups and in the
industry structure of bank credit portfolios.
Throughout this study, we emphasize the industry distribution of aggregate and short-term
bank credit. The focus on short-term lending is motivated by existing studies which point
to an immediate response of short- rather than long-term lending to changes in monetary
policy (Gertler and Gilchrist, 1993; Kakes and Sturm, 2002). Short-term loans are also
likely to respond more (i) to cyclical fluctuations in bank credit demand factors like industry
output and prices and (ii) to changes in monetary policy since they are renewed at shorter
intervals than long-term loans. We also focus on short-term lending because long-term credit
is determined by factors that cannot easily be constructed given the available information.
Because data on, for example, expected output and prices are unavailable at a low level of
industry aggregation, we cannot estimate our empirical model for long-term lending without
incurring the risk of reporting biased and inconsistent estimates due to an omitted variable
bias. Surely, the omitted variable bias may also affect the results for the model with aggregate
lending, where aggregate lending is computed as the sum of short-, medium-, and long-term
bank credit. The evidence on aggregate lending should therefore be viewed as reference point
to judge the plausibility of the results for short-term lending.
3.1 The Structure of the German Banking Sector
The financing system in Germany is a bank-based system, with banks being the most import-
ant source of external finance. The banking system can be divided into two main categories:
universal banks and specialized banks. At the end of 2003, the German banking sector con-
sisted of 2,466 banks of which 2,255 were universal and 211 were special. The German
banking system is hence a universal banking system. Given this property, the present analysis
disregards specialized banks and focuses on the three main universal banking groups, i.e., the
savings, cooperative, and commercial banking sector.
Each of the main banking groups can be divided into two tiers. The first tier consists of
few large head institutions, which are the Land banks, cooperative central banks, and the
big banks for the savings, credit cooperative, and commercial banking sector, respectively.
The second tier is composed of many primary institutions: local savings banks in the savings
banking sector, credit cooperatives in the cooperative banking sector, and regional and private
12See Hackethal (2004) for an extensive discussion of the properties of the German banking sector.

banks in the commercial banking sector. Commercial banks and the head institutions of the
savings and credit cooperative sector operate product portfolios which differ from those of
the primary savings and credit cooperative banks. The head institutions of the savings and
credit cooperative banking sector are the central bank to the corresponding primary (local)
banks and offer universal banking services to larger foreign and domestic banks and to non-
bank customers (cf. Hackethal, 2004). Particular to the head institutions of the savings
banking group is their role in providing services to the government of the state in which they
are located. Considering commercial banks, they structure their product portfolio around
investment and wholesale banking activities, predominantly serving large rather than small-
and medium-sized clients.
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the head and primary institutions regarding the distribu-
tion of total assets, bank capitalization, liquidity, short-term interbank claims, and non-bank
lending.13 As is evident for the sample period 1992:1-2002:4, the structural differences be-
tween the head and primary institutions are reflected in the descriptive statistics of the bank
balance sheet variables. Primary institutions are on average better capitalized than their
respective head institutions even though they are smaller. Besides, local savings banks and
regional and private commercial banks tend to be more liquid than Land banks and big banks,
while the primary institutions of the cooperative banking sector are on average less liquid than
their central institutions. Regardless of the banking group, a comparatively large share of
liquidity is accounted for by short-term interbank claims. With the exception of regional and
private commercial banks, primary institutions hold a larger share of interbank claims than
their respective head institutions.
Considering the distribution of lending to non-banks14, the primary institutions in each bank-
ing sector lend on average more to non-banks than the respective head institutions. The
difference is particularly pronounced for the credit cooperative sector: lending by central in-
stitutes accounts on average for 17 percent of total assets, while the corresponding number
for credit cooperatives is 60 percent. The central institutions' low involvement in non-bank
lending is attributable to their main role as central bank to the primary credit cooperatives.
In this function, they act as clearing institutions for interbank transfers between credit coop-
eratives and assist primary credit cooperatives in accessing financial markets and in serving
their customers.15
As regards the share of industry bank credit to non-bank credit, the primary and head insti-
13As regards local savings banks, the descriptive statistics refer to public savings banks only. The present
study excludes private savings banks since they operate under a different institutional setup. The existence
of significant differences in the balance sheet structure of public and private savings banks is confirmed by
the test statistics of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for almost all sampled balance sheet items. The
ANOVA test statistics are available on request.
14Non-bank lending involves bank credit supply to domestic businesses, private households, government,
and foreign non-banks.

tutions of the commercial or savings banking group do not differ in the degree of industry
lending. A comparatively large share of aggregate non-bank lending is allocated towards
industries (i.e., businesses and self-employed), exceeding 50 percent and 40 percent of total
non-bank lending for the commercial and savings banking group, respectively. Pronounced
differences again prevail between the primary and head institutions of the credit cooperative
sector: industry lending by central credit institutes and primary credit cooperatives accounts
on average for approximately two-third and four-ninth of total non-bank lending, respectively.
Considering the share of short-term lending to total lending, we find considerable differences
between head and primary institutions for all banking groups. Except for the credit co-
operative sector, head institutions provide on average less short-term finance than primary
banks.
The entries in Table 1 also demonstrate that there are not only differences in the balance sheet
structure within each banking group, but also between banking groups. These differences are
expected to affect the conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of monetary policy for
individual banking groups. For example, banks belonging to banking groups with a relatively
large amount of liquid assets (group i) might be better able to insulate their lending activities
from monetary policy changes than banks in banking groups with only few liquid assets (group
j). If this holds, cross-bank differences in liquidity might be a less important source of bank
lending effects of monetary policy in group i than in group j. This in turn suggests that
banking group differences in liquidity may affect conclusions regarding the strength of the
bank lending effects of monetary policy.
Because they constitute the focal point of the present empirical analysis, we confine the
comparison to the primary institutions of the banking groups. As is evident from Table 1,
the largest and most liquid banks operate in the savings banking sector, while the smallest
and least liquid banks belong to the group of credit cooperatives. The regional and private
banks in the commercial banking sector report the largest share of bank capital, exceeding
that of savings and cooperative banks by more than 90 and 60 percent, respectively. The
descriptive analysis also shows that each banking group reports a high share of non-bank
lending to total assets. Whereas the primary institutions of the credit cooperative and savings
banking sector report on average comparable shares of non-bank lending to total assets, the
corresponding share tends to be lower for the commercial banking group. This reflects the
greater involvement of commercial banks in lending to banks.16
However, when looking at the share of total industry lending to non-bank lending, the primary
institutions of the commercial banking sector lend on average more to industries than savings
banks and credit cooperatives. The descriptive evidence suggests that the difference in
the average share of total industry lending reflects considerable differences in the role of
banking groups as source of short-term finance to industries. Regional and private commercial
16For 1992:1-2002:4, the share of bank lending to total assets was on average equal to 34 percent, 13
percent, and 8 percent for commercial, credit cooperative, and savings banks, respectively.
9
banks tend to be more heavily engaged in short-term finance than credit cooperatives or
savings banks. In fact, short-term lending to industries as share of total industry lending is
approximately twice as large for commercial banks than for credit cooperatives and savings
banks. The apparent weakness of savings banks and credit cooperatives in short-term finance
is attributable to their practice of confining business to local areas. Superior knowledge of
local market conditions facilitates assessments regarding the long-term creditworthiness of
debtors, which yields a comparative advantage in long-term lending.
In order to ascertain the statistical significance of cross-banking group differences in the
balance sheet structure, we analyze the variance properties of the bank characteristics by
means of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Table 2 reports the ANOVA test statistics
for asset size, liquidity, capitalization, short-term interbank claims, and the volume of bank
credit. Panel A contains the results for the three main banking groups, i.e., commercial,
savings, and credit cooperative banks and panel B summarizes the evidence for six sub-
groups of the credit cooperative banking group. Using the classification scheme of the
Deutsche Bundesbank, the credit cooperative sub-groups are commercial cooperatives, rural
cooperatives, Raiffeisen banks, Sparda banks, PSD banks (Post-, Spar-und Darlehensvereine),
and civil servants banks. We deem this distinction necessary to control for banking group
differences in the balance sheet structure and for differences in the type of customer.
A comparison of the mean squared values in Table 2 illustrates that the hypothesis of equal
means can be rejected for all bank characteristics and for each banking group sample. The
evidence thus points to statistically significant differences in the balance sheet structure of
banking groups. This in turn suggests that conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of
monetary policy changes might be sensitive to the choice of banking group. To control for
this possibility, we will therefore estimate industry-specific bank lending functions by explicitly
allowing for individual 'sub-group' effects.
3.2 The Industry Structure of Bank Loan Portfolios
So far, the description of the structure of the German banking sector is confined to the
distribution of lending to the grand total of industries. This section extends the analysis in
that it stresses the industry structure of bank credit portfolios. Table 3 reports lending to
industry i in total lending by banking group for eight industries at the one-digit industry level
(main industries) and for nine industries at the two-digit industry level (manufacturing sub-
sectors).17 Given the focus of the present analysis, we only stress the distribution of aggregate
and short-term lending as provided by commercial banks (big banks, regional, and private
banks) and by the primary institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking group.
17Given a change in the industry classification scheme, the bank lending data display a break in 1995:1.
Because the descriptive statistics are robust to the 1995:1 observation, the entries in Table 3 refer to the
whole sample period 1992:1-2002:4.
10
We express aggregate and short-term lending to industry i as share of, respectively, aggregate
and short-term lending to the grand total of industries. Because the industry distribution of
aggregate and short-term credit is largely comparable, we provide a general discussion.
The statistics in Table 3 point to cross-industry differences in the distribution of bank credit.
Banks predominantly lend to industries which account for the largest share of output in the
aggregate economy: the service, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing industry.
Cooperative, savings, and commercial banks hold on average, respectively, 69 percent, 81
percent, and 89 percent of their bank loan portfolio with these sectors.18
As regards the remaining main industries, the volume of bank credit tends to be more evenly
distributed across sectors. Agriculture and construction primarily obtain bank finance from the
credit cooperative banking group, with rural credit cooperatives and Raiffeisen banks being
the primary source of bank finance.19 The importance of credit cooperatives for agriculture
and construction reflects the regional character of (i) credit cooperatives and (ii) agricultural
and constructing firms: lenders and borrowers confine their activities to a particular local
area. In adopting a regional focus, credit cooperatives have superior knowledge of local
market conditions, which facilitates assessments regarding local economic prospects and the
creditworthiness of potential debtors.
The share of bank credit is on average smallest for the finance and insurance industry. One
possible explanation for this relationship are large operating surpluses in the finance sector
which reduce the need for external finance in general and bank finance in particular.20 Next to
the finance industry, the energy sector also receives comparatively little credit from commercial
banks and from the primary institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking group.
Although not reported in Table 3, the Land banks are an important source of finance to the
energy sector. For the period 1992:1-2002:4, 12 percent of total lending by Land banks was
directed towards the energy sector, with short- and long-term bank credit accounting for 28
and 60 percent, respectively. The importance of Land banks as source of long-term finance
18The data suggest that approximately half of these shares is accounted for by lending to the service sector.
While lending to the service sector is certainly substantial, no clear conclusions prevail as to the sector's
absolute importance as recipient of bank lending. The reason is that the Bundesbank borrower statistics
report bank lending to the service sector as residual of bank lending to the remaining industries. For the
remainder of this paper, this shortcoming should be kept in mind when interpreting the empirical evidence
for the service sector.
19Raiffeisen banks and rural credit cooperatives grant 26 (19) percent and 16 (12) percent of aggregate
(short-term) credit to agriculture, respectively. In comparison, the corresponding number for commercial
credit cooperatives is 6 (5) percent. The cross-banking group differences are less pronounced for lending
to the construction industry. Raiffeisen banks, rural credit cooperatives, and commercial credit cooperatives
hold 14 (19) percent, 12 (16) percent, and 12 (15) percent of aggregate (short-term) loans with construction,
respectively.
20For the time period 1992:1-2002:4, the share of operating surplus to value added equals 51 percent with
a standard deviation of 2.30 percent for the finance and insurance sector (own computation using the OECD's
STAN database for Industrial Analysis). In comparison, operating surplus accounts for at most 31 percent of
value added for the remaining industries.
11
to the energy sector is attributable to the components of this sector: mining and quarrying;
electricity, gas, and water supply. Given the importance of each of these sub-sectors for the
functioning of the economy, general interest is with the maintenance and improvement of the
underlying infrastructures. Maintenance requires large fixed expenditures, while infrastructure
investment involves costs which tend to be sunk. In order to encourage investment, Land
banks grant favorable access to especially long-term finance even though investment per se
might not be profitable.
Turning to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry, lending to each of the sectors only
accounts for a small share of total bank credit, with the share of bank credit to each sector
being positively related to its size in the aggregate economy. Lending to the manufacturing
sub-sectors hence tends to be unevenly distributed. The share of bank credit is compara-
tively small for the coke and chemicals, rubber and plastic, and non-metallic mineral goods
producing sector. However, it is relatively large for the wood and paper, machinery and
transport equipment, food, and metals producing sector. In fact, lending to these sectors is
of approximately the same magnitude as lending to the finance and transport sector.21
4 Empirical Model
The remainder of this paper stresses industry-specific cyclical determinants of bank credit
demand as factors which have a strong effect on bank lending to industries.22 Besides
cyclical credit demand factors, we will also stress the role of monetary policy as determinant
of industry-specific bank lending and test for credit channel effects of monetary policy via
bank lending. The corresponding evidence allows for inferences as to the importance of the
industry structure of bank credit portfolios as determinant of monetary policy effectiveness and
industry performance through the availability of industry-specific bank credit. Furthermore,
we test whether conclusions are robust to the choice of aggregate and short-term bank credit.
The remainder of this section presents the industry-specific bank lending functions and the
methodological approach that will be employed to identify the industry effects of bank credit
demand and monetary policy.
4.1 Empirical Estimation Framework
In order to identify the response of bank lending to changes in bank credit demand and
monetary policy, we apply the dynamic panel estimation framework of Ehrmann et al. (2003),
21Similar conclusions prevail for descriptive statistics that control for the 1995:1 structural break in the
industry bank lending series by dropping the corresponding observation from the analysis. The break results
from a redefinition of the industry classification scheme.
22In the ideal case, one would also like to explain cross-industry differences in the distribution of credit
with structural industry characteristics. Unfortunately, the small number of industries and the unavailability
of structural industry data of sufficient quality prevent an analysis along this line.

functions. Although we use the same structural estimation framework, the analysis adds to
the existing work by exploring the industry dimension of bank lending. Equation (1) describes
the empirical bank lending function for bank b and industry i.23

 is the first log-difference operator of variable V defined as   log Vt
- log Vt-1
. With
the exception of the money market interest rate, the first log-difference transformation is
applied to all variables. The money market interest rate enters in first differences. Ehrmann
et al. (2003) motivate the first-difference structure of the empirical model by stressing that
the monetary policy effect on bank lending is confined to new loans. They hence interpret
the first log-difference of bank credit as flow variable and introduce the level of loans as
stock variable. When suggesting this measure of new loans, Ehrmann et al. (2003) fail to
recognize that the first difference is an imperfect measure of new bank loans since it reflects
the net effect of new loan issues and loan repayments. Unfortunately, the present study can
only acknowledge this shortcoming, but cannot resolve it because of data unavailability. As
a consequence, reductions in the volume of loans outstanding may reflect a decline in new
loan issues or a net increase in loan repayments.

approximates industry-specific output at time t which serves as a measure of cyclically
determined industry-specific bank credit demand. Priceit
denotes the industry-specific price at
time t and is included to capture cyclical fluctuations in industry-specific price developments
and their effect on bank credit demand. Unfortunately, industry output and industry price
do not only determine the external financing needs of industries, but also influence the
23Also see section 6.4 and appendix C for alternative model specifications. An appealing alternative spec-
ification of model (1) stacks bank lending by industry for all industries and captures industry effects with
industry dummies. Given the large number of banks and industries, computational limitations preclude the
realization of this approach in the present framework.
13
perceptions of banks as to the riskiness of industries. The importance of industry output
and industry prices as measures of risk implies, however, that a unique identification of bank
credit demand effects with output and prices is infeasible. These variables may also affect
bank credit supply through balance sheet effects.24 For example, a decline in industry output
and a decline in industry prices reduces the willingness of banks to grant loans since both
developments worsen the balance sheet position of firms, which leaves them more risky.
Industry output may also determine the access to bank finance because it influences the
ability of sectors to offer collateral in return for external finance. Given that banks perceive
industries with little collateral to be more risky, lending to these industries is likely to be
comparatively low. This relationship suggests that output may affect bank lending beyond
the effect suggested by cross-industry differences in bank credit demand. Unfortunately,
we can only acknowledge the caveat that industry output and industry prices are imperfect
measures of bank credit demand effects but cannot distinguish the bank credit demand and
bank credit supply effects inherent to output and inflation. The empirical evidence for these
variables therefore needs to be interpreted with some caution.
Monetary policy actions are represented by the change in the three-months money market
interest rate rM
. We assume that the interest rate is strictly exogenous to bank lending.25
In order to identify the bank lending effects of monetary policy, the money market interest
rate (rM,t-j
) at time t-j is interacted with bank characteristics (Xb,t-1
) at time t-1. The vector
of bank-specific characteristics Xb
includes asset size (TA), liquidity (A), and capitalization
(K) at time t-1. Bank characteristics are introduced with one lag to avoid an endogeneity
bias (cf. Kashyap and Stein, 1995, 2000; Ehrmann et al., 2003; Worms, 2003; Gambacorta
and Mistrulli, 2004). Appendix B contains a formal definition of the bank characteristics.
Worms (2003) and Ehrmann and Worms (2004) show that the tight relationship between
the primary and head institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking sector causes
bank asset size to be an inappropriate proxy variable of the bank lending effects of monetary
policy. One explanation is that interbank operations enable small banks to shield their loan
portfolio and funding possibilities against monetary policy shocks by providing a relatively
unconstrained access to central bank money. In that sense, the interbank market helps to
redistribute liquidity within the banking sector from banks with excess liquidity to banks
in need of liquidity. This in turn moderates financing constraints for small banks. As a
consequence, the interest rate sensitivity of small bank lending does not have to be higher
than that of large banks. Bank size might also be an inappropriate measure of information
asymmetries because savings banks as well as credit cooperatives back their funds with
mutual guarantees. This serves to recapitalize banks and creates a type of insurance scheme
for creditors in case of bank insolvency. The existence of these insurance schemes implies that
24We thank Heinz Herrmann for rising this point. Also see section 2 for a corresponding note.
25See Worms (2003) for empirical evidence as to the robustness of the interest rate response of bank lending
to the assumption of exogeneity.
14
information asymmetries may not affect the lending behavior of banks. Consequently, size
appears to be an inadequate variable to identify the loan supply effects of monetary policy
and alternative better measures might be bank capitalization or bank liquidity.
The present model employs a 'broad' and 'narrow' measure of bank liquidity. The main
difference concerns the way short-term interbank claims are treated. The 'broad' measure of
liquidity includes short-term interbank claims and is defined as the ratio of cash plus securities
plus short-term interbank claims over total bank assets. For this definition, possible significant
relationships between bank liquidity and the monetary policy response of bank lending can
be driven by short-term interbank claims (cf. Worms, 2003 and Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).
In order to determine whether short-term interbank claims indeed drive liquidity effects, we
follow Worms (2003) and split the broad measure of liquidity into two components: (i) a
'narrow' part of liquidity defined as the ratio of cash plus securities over total bank assets and
(ii) the share of short-term interbank claims to total assets. Both components are separately
included in estimations of model (1).26 The corresponding models will subsequently be
referred to as narrow liquidity and interbank specifications.
We summarize the bank lending effects of changes in monetary policy and changes in bank
credit demand by computing the long-run elasticities of bank lending with respect to the
explanatory variables in model (1).27 The industry-specific long-run coefficients LR,i
are
defined as the sum of the lags of the variable in question divided by one minus the sum of
the coefficients on the lagged bank credit variable: LR,i
=
J
j=1
ij
1- J
j=1
ij
, where J=4.28 Since
the long-run coefficients are a non-linear function of the estimated parameters, we derive the
corresponding standard errors by means of the standard delta method.29
We hypothesize the long-run coefficient estimates in model (1) to enter with the following
signs. Motivated by the negative effects of higher interest rates on bank reserves, we expect
bank lending to decline in response to a monetary contraction. The distributional effects of
monetary policy are anticipated to be such that the response of bank lending to monetary
policy changes is less pronounced for larger, more liquid, and better capitalized banks. This
holds if the coefficient on the interaction term between each bank characteristic and the
interest rate is positive. Ambivalent conclusions prevail with respect to the expected effect of
industry output growth on bank lending growth. On the one hand, good economic conditions
increase the number of investment projects with positive net present value and hence the
26The subsequent analysis will thus report the results for a broad and narrow definition of liquidity and for
short-term interbank claims.
27We follow the existing literature when referring to long-run elasticities (e.g., Deutsche Bundesbank, 2002b;
Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004; Worms, 2003; Ehrmann et al., 2003). An alternative and more intuitive
interpretation views the 'long-run' coefficient as the lasting response of bank lending growth to changes in
either bank credit demand or monetary policy.
28The properties of the residuals do not change with J=5.
29To conserve on space, we only report the short-run coefficient for the one-period lag of the normalized
bank characteristics. The short-run coefficients for the remaining variables are available on request.

demand for bank finance. On the other hand, economic growth stimulates internal cash
flows, which may reduce credit demand. Because evidence in favor of a negative relationship
between output and bank lending is hardly existing, the long-run coefficient on output growth
is expected to be positive.30
Finally, industry inflation is anticipated to stimulate bank lending growth.31 This relationship
holds for demand- as well as supply-side-driven developments in prices. On the supply side,
industry inflation due to higher input prices may cause firms to demand more bank credit to
offset the effect of higher production costs on short-run profits. In order to observe this effect,
output prices need to exhibit short-run price stickiness; a phenomenon accounted for by, for
example, menu costs. On the demand side, industry inflation may reflect good economic
conditions and promising investment opportunities for firms. Similar to the argument for
industry output, good investment opportunities may increase the demand for external finance.
The present analysis does not explicitly account for merger-driven changes in the German
banking system and hence does not control for the effects of mergers on the individual
characteristics of the merging banks. The appropriateness of this approach is suggested by
Worms (2003) who finds the long-run bank lending effects of monetary policy to be the same
for samples which do not control for mergers and for samples which treat a merged bank
as single bank for the pre- and post-merger sample period. Besides, implementation lags
between the time a merger is officially announced and the time a merger is legally realized
makes it difficult to determine the date of a merger. For these reasons, we will eliminate
most merger effects with the outlier detection procedure introduced in section 5.
4.2 Methodology
The system in equation (1) represents a fixed effects dynamic (unbalanced) panel with large
T and large N. Lagged values of the dependent variable are included to control for an omitted
variable and endogeneity bias. Because the lagged dependent variable is correlated with the
error term, dynamic panel models are typically not estimated with the static panel fixed
effects estimator. Doing so would introduce a finite sample bias of order 1
T
for N  
and fixed T (see Nickell, 1981; Kiviet, 1995). In order to avoid biased and inconsistent
estimates, Arellano and Bond (1991) suggest the use of a generalized method of moments
(GMM) estimator. Recent studies have challenged this method. Blundell and Bond (1998)
and Blundell, Bond, and Windmeijer (2000) have shown that the first-differenced GMM
estimates are biased downwards in the direction of the within-group estimates and Alvarez
30See De Bondt (1998), Worms (2003), Ehrmann et al. (2003), and Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004)
for evidence in favor of a positive relationship between bank lending and output. Altunba¸
s, Fazylov, and
Molyneux (2002) report a positive output coefficient for medium-sized and undercapitalized banks and a
negative coefficient for small-sized and under- or overcapitalized banks in Germany.
31Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) report evidence of a positive price effect on
bank lending.
16
and Arellano (2003) show that the GMM estimator is close to the fixed effects estimator for
large T. Furthermore, Jung (2005) illustrates that Arrelano and Bond's (1991) test of serial
residual correlation may build on inconsistently estimated residuals. Because these are used
to decide on the optimal over-identifying restrictions, coefficient estimates are likely to be
inconsistent.
In view of these points and given a comparatively large set of data points in the time dimen-
sion, we estimate the dynamic panel model by using the fixed effects estimator. Besides, the
use of the fixed effects estimator is also motivated by the evidence from the Hansen J-statistic
according to which the over-identifying restrictions in the present set of GMM estimations
are invalid regardless of the instrumentalization. In order to ensure that the presence of au-
tocorrelation in the residuals it
does not result in inconsistent and inefficient estimators, we
compute White-period standard errors (Arellano, 1987), which are robust to arbitrary serial
correlation and time-varying variances in the residuals. We test for the existence of first-order
and second-order serial autocorrelation by regressing the within regression residuals against
their one- and two-period lag. The underlying model allows for fixed effects and White-period
standard errors.32
5 Data
Ideally, the analysis of the industry-specific bank lending effects of changes in bank credit
demand and monetary policy would build on firm-level as well as bank-level data. Bank-level
data allow for the identification of the credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank
lending and firm-level data allow for assessments regarding the operation of a credit channel
through balance sheet effects. Even though firm-level data are available from the corporate
balance sheet statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank, they are not useful for our purpose
because they are only available at an annual frequency and subject to a large firm bias.33
Given the unavailability of adequate firm-level data, we determine the bank lending effects
of changes in credit demand and monetary policy for industry aggregates. Industry data are
compiled for industries at the one- and two-digit industry level. The latter are sub-sectors of
the manufacturing industry (see Appendix A).
Bank-level data on bank-specific credit supply to individual industries and bank-specific bal-
ance sheet variables are respectively obtained from the quarterly borrower statistics and
monthly bank balance sheet statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank for the period 1992-2003.
Because data in 2003 display patterns that are irreconcilable with those in earlier years, we
confine the analysis of quarterly data to the period 1992:1-2002:4. In addition, the industry
32Note, the conclusions regarding the existence of serial autocorrelation are robust to the way in which
the first- and second-order autocorrelation coefficient is computed. A simple least-squares estimator without
fixed effects and White-period standard errors produces comparable results.
33See Deutsche Bundesbank (1998b) for details.
17
bank lending series are subject to a structural break in 1995:1. Resulting from a redefinition of
the industry classification scheme, the break is particularly pronounced for some sub-sectors
of the manufacturing industry. In order to avoid that the empirical results capture the ef-
fect of the structural break, the 1995:1 observation is, first of all, dropped from all industry
estimations. Unfortunately, the residuals of the corresponding estimations are frequently se-
rially correlated and the long-run coefficients therefore biased and inconsistent. In a second
step, the bank lending specifications are re-estimated with the 1995:1 observation. Because
the consequent error terms tend to behave better and given that the long-run coefficients
from estimations with and without the 1995:1 observation compare well in terms of sign,
the present paper reports the evidence from specifications with the 1995:1 value. However,
we confine the analysis to those industries for which the structural break is less pronounced.
This implies that four out of nine sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry are not further
considered.34
The bank-specific balance sheet and lending data display seasonal patterns. For each bank,
these are removed by means of the centered-moving average method. This is an admittedly
simple adjustment procedure which can be criticized for ignoring, for example, working day
and leap year effects. However, it is the preferred method in the present analysis because
it is applicable despite the large number of cross sections. Furthermore, a comparison of
the seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted series shows that the centered moving average
procedure captures seasonal fluctuations well.
Information on industry production and industry prices is available from the New Cronos
database at a monthly frequency for most industries. For some industries, industry output is
approximated with industry value added. The corresponding data are provided by the German
federal statistical office. The monthly data on industry output and prices are converted into
quarterly data to match the frequency of the bank lending data. While data on industry
output are directly obtained for the sample period 1992:1-2002:4, information on industry
prices is only available as of 1995:1. In order to identify the 1992:1-1994:4 values, we regress
the industry-specific price index against a constant and the contemporaneous value of the
aggregate price index and use the coefficient estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) to
extrapolate the missing values on industry-specific prices. Industry prices for the wholesale
and retail trade, finance and insurance, transport and communication, and service sector are
not available from the New Cronos database. Instead, we construct them using information
on nominal and real value added from the German statistical office for the whole sample
period 1992:1-2002:4.35
34The following sub-sectors are eliminated: (i) basic metals and fabricated metals products, (ii) machinery
and transport equipment, (iii) electrical and optical equipment, (iv) wood and products of wood and cork;
pulp, paper, and paper products.
35Note, the German statistical office reports data on nominal and real value added jointly for the (i)
wholesale and retail trade sector and (ii) transport and communication sector. Unfortunately, we cannot
disentangle the industry-specific price for each of these sectors, but have to rely on the composite price
measure.
18
The New Cronos database and the Bundesbank quarterly borrower statistics occasionally dif-
fer in terms of industry aggregation. In particular, the borrower statistics tend to refer to
composites of industries rather than to individual units. In order to adopt the same level
of industry aggregation, the New Cronos data on industry production and industry charac-
teristics are also combined across some industries. The composite indices are constructed
by controlling for the relative importance of the single industries in the composite. Limited
by data availability, the weights are approximated as the 1992-2002 ratio of annual value
added of industry i to aggregate value added of the industries included in the composite.
Since the weights are time-invariant, the use of the 1992-2002 average as weight seems to
be innocuous.
In order to ensure the reliability of the empirical results, the quarterly data are screened
along different lines. Firstly, the data are checked for outliers. Outlier detection concerns
the relationship between variables as well as the distribution of variables. One relationship
concerns the need of banks to meet their balance sheet constraint. For the requirement that
total assets equal total liabilities, the study keeps all but 5 data points.36 Another relationship
is defined as the need to have positive entries for credit supply and total assets. In the present
sample, at most 18 data points for industry-specific loans and 47 data points for total assets
do not meet the non-negativity constraint. These observations are excluded from the sample.
As regards the distribution of variables, the outlier detection procedure is predominantly
implemented for variables in levels. The exception concerns the volume of bank credit and
total bank assets. In order to avoid the exclusion of very large and very small banks on
the ground of sheer size, the outlier detection procedure for total assets and the volume of
bank credit is implemented for their first log-differences.37 Regardless of the variable, outliers
are detected by using the sequential outlier rejection (SOR) algorithm described in Corney
(2002). In contrast to standard methods like the z-score or box plot method, this outlier
detection procedure adopts a sequential approach which accounts for the effect of outliers
on the standard error in the sample. Furthermore, the SOR approach does not assume the
normal distribution of banks at any point in time. This property is particularly valuable since
the hypothesis of normally distributed banks can be rejected for all sampled variables (see
Table 1 and Table 3).
The SOR algorithm requires the data to be repeatedly clustered using any clustering algo-
rithm. The present analysis uses k-means clustering for each of the main banking groups,
with k = 2.38 For each repetition, the sum-squared error for k-means is computed, which
describes the sum-squared deviation of each data point in the sample to the nearest clus-
36A data point is a single time observation associated with an individual bank (e.g., the observation
associated with bank i in 1992:1).

clusters.

ter center. The data point that contributes most to the sum-squared error for k-means is
excluded from the sample. For each point in time and each banking group, the clustering
algorithm is iteratively applied to the dataset. The number of iterations is roughly equal to
5 percent of the number of banks at each point in time.39 That is, the first step of the
procedure treats 5 percent of all banks at each point in time as potential outlier. The second
step builds on the iteratively excluded observations from step one and determines the actual
number of outliers by using the second difference of the sum-squared error term. Under
the assumption that the sum-squared error rate is driven by outliers, the second derivative
is close to zero and the cumulative sum thereof is constant for the sequence of data which
excludes atypical observations. In the present study, we exclude any data point as outlier if
it explains more than one percent of the cumulative sum of the second derivative. Similar to
other outlier detection methods (e.g., the box plot method and the z-approach), the choice
of threshold is arbitrary.
The analysis is confined to institutions which have the status of a monetary finance institute
(MFI) throughout the whole sample period. The restricted focus is necessitated by a change
in data definition. Until 1998:4, non-MFIs were treated as financial institutions and the
Deutsche Bundesbank borrower statistics reported lending by these institutions to enterprises
and households. As of 1999:1, non-MFIs are treated as enterprises and the borrower statistics
do no longer report lending by, but credit supply to these institutions. In order to avoid that
the definitional change of non-MFIs from being creditors to being debtors biases the results,
we exclude banks with a non-MFI status in any quarter during the sample period. This leads
to a loss of 1400 data points from the commercial banking group and 208 data points from
the cooperative banking group.
6 Empirical Results
This section reports the empirical results of the fixed effects dynamic panel estimation. In
section 6.1, we first describe the different samples for which the benchmark model (1) is
estimated. Section 6.2 then reports ANOVA test statistics that help to structure the analysis
of the empirical results from the dynamic panel in section 6.3. We conclude the present
section with robustness tests of the benchmark model (1).
6.1 Sample Overview
The empirical model is estimated for different combinations of banking groups. Table 4
summarizes the composition of the samples. One sample jointly includes the primary (local)
institutions of the commercial, savings, and credit cooperative sector. This group is subse-
39The number of iterations depends on the availability of data for a given banking group at a particular
point in time. The results are not sensitive to a larger number of iterations.
20
quently referred to as the aggregate banking group. Group-specific effects are captured with
banking group dummies for the savings and commercial banking group. Because the dum-
mies turn out to be statistically insignificant in almost all specifications, weak or no banking
group effects appear to exist for savings and commercial banks relative to credit cooperatives.
In view of this finding, the subsequent evidence for the aggregate banking group refers to
the results from estimations without banking group dummies. We also estimate the model
for the credit cooperative banking sector, with banking dummies for the commercial credit
cooperative banking group and Raiffeisen banks. In contrast to the aggregate banking group,
the dummies turn out to be statistically significant for most industry bank lending functions.
In order to allow for the possibility of parameter heterogeneity across banking groups, another
sample is separately defined for the three main sub-groups of the credit cooperative banking
group (i.e., rural, commercial, and Raiffeisen banks) and for savings banks. The importance
of possible panel heterogeneity is suggested by the ANOVA evidence in section 3.1 that points
to structural differences between (i) the savings and cooperative banking group and (ii) the
sub-groups of the cooperative banking sector. When estimating individual models for the
savings and credit cooperative banking group, we assume cross-bank homogeneity in the
interest rate elasticity of loan demand and hence cross-bank similarities in the distribution
of bank-dependent and bank-independent customers within each individual banking group.
We do not estimate an individual model for the commercial banking group or for the head
institutions of the savings and credit cooperative banking sector because they operate product
portfolios which differ from those of the local savings and credit cooperative banks. Besides,
estimates for an individual sample of commercial banks are not reported since the number
of cross sections is low. The fixed number of observations causes the fixed effects estimator
and the robust covariance matrix estimates to be inconsistent although T is relatively large.
6.2 Analysis of Variance Tests
The representation of the results is complicated by the cross-sectional dimension of the
study. To condense the analysis, this section first reports test statistics of one- and two-
way analyses of variance which illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of bank
characteristic, the choice of aggregate and short-term lending, and the choice of industry and
banking group. The test statistics are computed for the long-run coefficients of model (1)
irrespective of the significance properties of the coefficient estimates. If we would confine
the analysis to industries for which significant estimates are reported, ANOVA would not
be feasible. Despite the inclusion of insignificant estimates, the results are still deemed to
be illustrative. On the one hand, we only compute test statistics for variables for which
most industry-specific long-run estimates are statistically significant, i.e., for industry output
growth, industry inflation, and the interest rate change. Test statistics are not reported for the
interaction terms because of pronounced differences in their statistical significance across the
different bank lending specifications. On the other hand, the insignificant industry-specific
21
coefficient estimates on either industry output growth, inflation, or the interest rate change
compare well with the significant estimates in terms of sign and magnitude regardless of the
choice of bank characteristic.
We first investigate whether the long-run coefficient estimates for industry output growth,
inflation, and the interest rate change are influenced by the choice of bank characteristic,
i.e., bank asset size, capitalization, broad/narrow liquidity, or short-term interbank claims.
Because the results from the one-way analysis of variance are robust to the choice of banking
group and do not differ for aggregate and short-term lending, we only report the results for
the aggregate banking group and for short-term lending.40 The results in Table 5 (columns
3 to 6) show that the null hypothesis of equal coefficients across bank characteristics cannot
be rejected. The choice of bank characteristic hence does not significantly affect the long-run
sensitivity of bank lending with respect to either industry-specific bank credit demand or the
money market interest rate.
We next ask whether the long-run coefficients of the sampled variables depend on the choice
of aggregate and short-term bank lending. Because the coefficient estimates are insensitive
to the choice of bank characteristic, we only report the one-way ANOVA test statistics for
bank asset size. The evidence in Table 5 (columns 7 to 10) points to the equality of the
long-run coefficients of industry output growth and interest rate changes for aggregate and
short-term lending. Considering inflation, conclusions regarding the determinants of bank
lending growth differ for aggregate and short-term credit. The discrepancy in the long-run
coefficients is attributable to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing sector.41
We conclude the discussion by formally testing whether differences in the bank lending ef-
fects are accounted for by banking groups or by industries. To this end, we compute the test
statistics of a two-way analysis of variance. Given the one-way ANOVA test statistics, we
only report the results for short-term lending and bank asset size, noting that the evidence
for aggregate lending and the remaining bank characteristics does not differ.42 Table 6 sum-
marizes the results. The analysis of variance shows that differences in the responsiveness of
short-term bank lending growth to industry output growth and industry inflation are attribu-
table to industries, but not to banking groups.43 That is, the evidence stresses discernible
industry dissimilarities in the bank lending effects of industry output growth and inflation.
40The results for the remaining banking groups are available on request.
41Despite differences in the long-run response of short-term and aggregate lending to industry inflation, we
only discuss the evidence for short-term lending to conserve on space. The results for aggregate lending are
available on request. Note, ANOVA tests for the main industries only do not find significant differences in
the long-run coefficients of industry inflation for aggregate and short-term lending.
42The ANOVA test statistics for estimations with bank capitalization, liquidity, and interbank assets and
for aggregate lending are available on request.
43We replicate the analysis of variance for a sample that excludes the construction sector. The restricted
focus is motivated by the unexpected positive interest rate response of bank lending to this industry. We find
the ANOVA results to be robust to this sample adjustment.
22
In contrast to output growth and inflation, differences in the long-run bank lending effects
of interest rate changes are explained by banking groups and industries. However, industry
effects appear to be the more important source of variation in the bank lending effects of
monetary policy. This conclusion builds on the observation that the F-value for the industry
effect exceeds the corresponding value for the banking group effect.
The ANOVA evidence illustrates that industries are the more important source of differences
in the bank lending effects of industry credit demand and monetary policy. In addition, we find
the results regarding the bank lending effects of industry output growth, industry inflation,
and monetary policy to be insensitive to the choice of aggregate and short-term lending.
Motivated by these findings and to condense on space, the following section presents and
discusses the empirical panel evidence on the determinants of industry-specific short-term
bank lending growth for the aggregate banking group.
6.3 Evidence from Industry-Specific Bank Lending Functions
The empirical evidence from the benchmark model (1) is discussed in two parts. In a first
step, we report the response of bank lending growth to changes in bank credit demand (i.e.,
industry output growth, industry inflation) and to changes in the money market interest rate.
We then discuss the interaction terms between bank characteristics and monetary policy to
draw conclusion as to the existence of credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank
lending. Table 7 summarizes the coefficient estimates for the industry-specific bank lending
functions.
(i) The Bank Lending Effects of Loan Demand and Monetary Policy
We report evidence for individual industries and for the grand total of industries. The evidence
for the grand total of industries is our benchmark in the discussion of the industry-specific bank
lending functions. Besides, when emphasizing the results for the grand total of industries,
we can compare the present empirical findings with the evidence of earlier studies which do
not adopt an industry-specific focus. In order to facilitate the readability of the results, we
label industries by using abbreviations. For example, the finance and insurance industry is
subsequently introduced as finance sector and the transport and communication sector is
referred to as transport sector. Appendix A provides details. Because the evidence in section
6.2 shows that the choice of bank characteristic does not affect the long-run sensitivity of
bank lending with respect to industry output growth, industry inflation, or the money market
interest rate, we provide a general discussion of the results regarding the industry-specific
bank lending effects of bank credit demand and monetary policy.
Considering the response of bank lending growth to industry output growth, the entries in
Table 7 illustrate that bank lending to the grand total of industries increases in response to
23
higher output growth. The positive output response of lending to the grand total reflects
the statistically significant and positive response of lending to growth in agriculture, con-
struction, trade, services, and the food manufacturing sector. At least for the construction
sector, the positive reaction of bank lending is influenced by the 1992-1995 re-unification
construction boom period that induced heavy investment. Opposite relationships exist for
total manufacturing and for the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry. This suggests
that manufacturing firms demand less bank credit in response to output growth.44 Possible
reasons are (i) higher internal flows of finance, which reduce external financing needs and/or
(ii) the absence of promising future economic prospects, which yield disincentives for invest-
ment. The relevance of the second point is suggested by the continuous decline in the share
of manufacturing value added in aggregate value added during the last decade.45 Next to the
manufacturing industry, we also find an inverse relationship between bank lending growth and
output growth for the finance sector. In contrast to the manufacturing industry, the finance
sector accounts for an increasingly larger share of aggregate value added. The decline in bank
lending may therefore reflect the effect of higher internal cash flow and the consequent lower
need for bank finance.
As regards the response of bank lending growth to inflation, it is significant and positive
for the grand total of industries. The positive reaction of bank lending to the grand total
of industries reflects the positive response of bank lending to almost all industries. The
exceptions are the transport and machinery and transport equipment manufacturing sector.
In contrast to expectations, bank lending to these sectors significantly contracts in response
to higher industry inflation.
Turning to the interest rate response of bank lending, the evidence confirms the view that
higher interest rates cause lending to the grand total of industries to contract. The decline in
bank lending reflects the negative effect of higher interest rates on bank reserves and credit
rationing on the part of banks in response to an increase in the risk of loan default. The
evidence in Table 7 also illustrates that this response is a weighed average of the interest rate
reaction of all industries. We find unanimous cross-industry differences in the nature of the
interest rate response of bank lending. On the one hand, the negative interest rate response
of lending to the grand total of industries reflects lower bank credit supply to the energy,
manufacturing, and transport industry, with the interest rate effect being most pronounced for
the first two sectors. We attribute the strength of the effect for the energy and manufacturing
industry to the comparatively high capital intensity of production, which is associated with
a higher probability of loan losses (cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, 1996). For the manufacturing
sector, the decline in lending reveals the negative interest rate effects of bank credit supply to
the chemicals and coke, rubber and plastic, and textiles producing sector. At least the textiles
producing sector is again more capital-intensive in comparison to the remaining industries.
44Also see Deutsche Bundesbank (1996) for a similar conclusion.
45The ratio of value added for manufacturing to value added for the grand total of industries declined from
0.26 in 1992 to 0.22 in 2002.
24
On the other hand, a monetary policy contraction induces higher lending to the construction,
trade, and finance industry and to producers of non-metallic mineral goods. The positive
interest rate response of lending to construction is not consistent with expectations. However,
it can be explained with the structural and cyclical characteristics of the construction sector.
As regards the structural properties, the construction industry is characterized by a large share
of small firms, which predominantly obtain bank credit from local credit cooperatives and
regional savings banks.46 Knowledge of local market conditions and local debtors reduces
information asymmetries and fosters housebank relationships. Housebank relationships, in
turn, facilitate the access to bank finance in general and in periods of high interest rates and
low demand in particular. Considering cyclical factors, the positive interest rate response of
bank lending reflects the demand-driven re-unification boom in construction. Even during
the 1991-1992 period of high interest rates, demand for residential buildings and production
plants was high and even continued to increase.
The positive interest rate response of bank lending to the finance industry can be explained
in terms of risk considerations. To explain, a contraction in monetary policy increases the
probability of loan default of firms in all industries. While the riskiness of firms in all industries
increases, banks may perceive firms in the finance sector to be less risky because they are
exposed to more stringent financial regulation and supervision than firms in the non-financial
sector. In view of this relationship, the positive interest rate response of lending to the finance
and insurance sector may describe the effort of banks to channel a larger share of their bank
credit portfolio towards relatively less risky firms in the finance sector.
The entries in Table 7 point to pronounced cross-industry differences in the magnitude of
the bank lending effects of output growth, inflation, and interest rate changes. The largest
response of bank lending to changes in monetary policy, industry inflation, and output growth
is observed for the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry. Indeed, bank lending to these
sectors tends to be more responsive than bank lending to the manufacturing aggregate or to
the grand total of industries. Next to the sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry, bank
lending also responds comparatively strongly to output growth in the finance industry and
to inflation in the construction and energy sector. The finance, construction, and energy
industry and the sub-sectors of manufacturing have in common that the share of credit to
these sectors is comparatively small (cf. Table 3). Bank lending thus seems to be more
responsive to output growth and inflation in industries that only account for a small share of
a bank's loan portfolio. This in turn suggests that banks primarily re-distribute credit between
industries to which bank lending is relatively small and that the overall industry composition
of a bank's loan portfolio is accordingly comparatively stable.
Overall, the evidence illustrates that the use of bank-level data on lending to the grand total
of industries (i.e., aggregate lending) only provides an imperfect view on the bank lending
effects of credit demand and monetary policy. Our results indicate that the direction and
46Also see section 3.2.
25
strength of aggregate bank lending effects depends on the industry structure of bank credit
portfolios. This finding is particularly interesting for the definition of monetary policy as it
shows that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on industry structure.
(ii) Are there Bank Lending Effects of Monetary Policy?
So far, the discussion has focused on the direct effects of monetary policy. This section
analyzes the empirical results for the interaction between bank characteristics and monetary
policy in order to identify the distributional effects of monetary policy on industry-specific
bank lending. As will become evident, conclusions as to the existence of cross-bank differences
in the interest rate response of bank lending are sensitive to the choice of bank asset size,
capitalization, liquidity, and short-term interbank claims.
The analysis of the interaction terms is subject to a shortcoming. As stated, the significance
properties of the interaction terms preclude tests regarding the relative contribution of indus-
tries and banking groups as source of variation. Visual inspection of significant interaction
terms points, however, to considerable differences in the sign and magnitude of the under-
lying credit channel effects across industries as well as banking groups. The differences are
such that a separate discussion of the coefficient estimates of all interaction terms is valuable
in its own right. However, this is beyond scope given the large number of industry-specific
bank lending models by bank characteristic, banking group, and loan maturity. We can only
acknowledge that conclusions regarding the credit channel effects of monetary policy depend
on the choice of model specification and stress the interaction terms for short-term bank
lending growth for the aggregate banking group.
Existing studies question the usefulness of capitalization and liquidity as proxy variables of
the bank lending effects of monetary policy. Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) argue that
the capital-to-asset ratio is an inappropriate measure of bank capitalization. The reason is
that bank capital does not illustrate the riskiness of a bank's portfolio. It therefore does not
correctly describe the severity of information asymmetries which, however, determines the
ability of banks to obtain non-reservable funding. Kashyap and Stein (2000) contemplate
that liquidity may provide a distorted view on the importance of bank balance sheet effects.
This is because liquidity is also determined by cash that banks cannot freely use since it is
subject to reserve requirements. Furthermore, Worms (2003) notes that bank lending reflects
the liquidity preferences of banks, with more liquid banks lending less. If this holds, cross-
bank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of bank lending are not uniquely attributable to
cross-bank differences in liquidity. We only mention these weaknesses associated with some
bank characteristics, but do not control for them for two reasons. Firstly, the share of cash
in total assets relative to other liquidity components is low. Secondly, quarterly data on the
riskiness of capital are not available in the present dataset. Even though capitalization and
liquidity might be imperfect identifiers of bank credit supply effects of monetary policy, we
report the results for these bank characteristics because we still assume that these variables
26
influence the response of bank lending to interest rate changes.
Table 7 contains the industry-specific bank lending effects of monetary policy associated with
cross-bank differences in asset size, capitalization, liquidity, or short-term interbank claims.
Conclusions regarding the bank lending effects of monetary policy transmission are sensitive
to the choice of bank characteristic and vary with the choice of industry. The evidence lends
strong support to the existence of bank size effects in monetary policy transmission. For the
grand total of industries and for almost all sampled industries, a monetary policy contraction
causes bank lending of large banks to adjust less than bank credit of small banks. That is,
large banks are better able to insulate their lending activities against monetary-policy-induced
changes in the availability of reservable and non-reservable funds of finance. Inconsistent with
the credit channel theory, the interest rate response of bank lending to the finance industry is
more pronounced for large than for small banks. This finding possibly reflects the importance
of commercial banks as source of lending to the finance industry (cf. Table 3) and the fact
that commercial banks are on average larger in terms of asset size than savings banks and
credit cooperatives (cf. Table 1). Insignificant effects are recorded in estimations for the
construction and transport sector and for the non-metallic goods producing sector.
In contrast to bank asset size, cross-bank heterogeneities in capitalization do not explain
cross-bank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of bank credit to the grand total of
industries and to most individual industries. The exception is lending to agriculture, finance,
services, and manufacturing. Except for the agricultural sector, better capitalized banks
adjust lending less than poorly capitalized banks. The insignificance of bank capitalization
lends support to the view that a risk-unadjusted measure of capitalization may imperfectly
approximate the degree of information asymmetries.
Cross-bank asymmetries in the monetary policy response of bank lending to some industries
are also attributable to cross-bank heterogeneities in the share of liquid assets. As discussed,
the liquidity effects of monetary policy are separately identified for a broad and narrow measure
of liquidity and for short-term interbank claims in order to determine whether short-term
interbank claims affect the bank lending effects associated with liquidity. The evidence shows
that broad and/or narrow liquidity significantly attenuates the interest rate response of lending
to the grand total of industries and to the agricultural, construction, trade, transport, textiles,
and food industry. The evidence lends comparatively weak support to the role of short-term
interbank claims as determinant of the liquidity effects of monetary policy. Indeed, significant
short-term interbank effects are confined to very few industries: construction, trade, and
transport. This suggests that short-term interbank claims are a weak driving source of liquidity
effects. In addition, because interbank claims are insignificant in explaining the interest rate
response of credit supply to industries for which bank asset size possesses explanatory power,
bank asset size appears to capture the bank lending effects of information asymmetries. That
is, the evidence in the present study does not lend support to the finding of Worms (2003)
according to which interbank claims dwarf the effects associated with bank asset size.
27
Comparing the magnitude of the distributional effects of monetary policy, differences prevail
across bank characteristics. Indeed, cross-bank asymmetries in the interest rate response of
bank lending are least pronounced for bank asset size and most pronounced for estimations
with bank capitalization and short-term interbank claims. The evidence hence reveals that
bank size is not the main determinant of cross-bank differences in the response to monetary
policy changes. However, the relative importance of the capitalization effect should not be
overemphasized because we define capitalization without correcting for bank risk. Besides
these results, the entries in Table 7 suggest that the strength of bank lending effects of
monetary policy differs between industries. In contrast to direct monetary policy effects,
the cross-industry differences appear to be unrelated to the relative weight of industries in a
bank's credit portfolio.
Table 7 also reports the one-period lags of the bank characteristics. Even though the co-
efficients do not have an intrinsic meaning, they illustrate in combination with the direct
interest rate effect whether bank characteristics or monetary policy changes drive the sig-
nificance of the interaction terms. The evidence tends to be mixed. For the grand total of
industries, the significance of the coefficient on the interest rate change and the short-run
bank characteristic illustrates that the significance of the interaction term is attributable to
the direct bank lending effect of monetary policy and to cross-bank differences in any of
the bank characteristics. For the industry-specific bank lending functions, the distributional
effects of monetary policy are determined by either monetary policy or bank characteristics,
by both variables, or by none. For example, the significance of the interaction term on asset
size and capitalization in the estimation for total manufacturing is driven by the direct effect
of monetary policy but not by bank characteristics. For the transport sector, the absence of
credit channel effects in estimations with asset size seem to be driven by asset size given the
evidence in favor of significant interest rate effects.
Overall, the evidence lends comparatively weak support to the transmission of monetary policy
changes through bank lending. The conclusions as to the bank lending effects of monetary
policy are sensitive to the choice of industry. This in turn points to the existence of industry
effects of monetary policy through bank lending. In view of this finding, studies for the grand
total of industries are likely to provide an incomplete view on the bank lending effects of
monetary policy.
28
(iii) Cross-Study Comparison of the Results
For the grand total of industries, our evidence can be compared with that of existing studies.
The present results for the grand total of industries match those in Ehrmann et al. (2003) and
Worms (2003) only partly. One possible source of divergence are differences in the definition
of bank credit. While the earlier studies define bank credit for lending to households and
the grand total of industries, we do not include household lending.47 Another source of
heterogeneity concerns the outlier adjustment procedure. Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms
(2003) identify outliers by assuming the normal distribution of banks, while we allow for
skews in the distribution. The studies thus define outliers along different lines, which leads
to the exclusion of different observations. The most striking difference, however, concerns
the estimation methodology. Earlier studies estimate the dynamic panel model with GMM.
We find this estimator to be inapplicable. Neither for the long sample period 1992-2002
nor for the short sample period 1992-1998 as used by Worms (2003) do we find valid over-
identifying restrictions for our set of GMM estimations. We do not estimate the model for
the short sample period with the fixed effects estimator because the finite sample bias would
be stronger.
Our results are in line with those of Ehrmann et al. (2003) according to which bank lending
grows in response to output growth and inflation and declines in the wake of monetary
contraction. Furthermore, the present results are consistent with those in Ehrmann et al.
(2003) according to which cross-bank differences in the interest rate sensitivity of aggregate
bank credit cannot be attributed to differences in capitalization, but to differences in liquidity.
However, the present study reports evidence that lends support to the existence of bank size
effects in monetary policy transmission. In contrast to Worms (2003), the size effects are
not driven by interbank claims since they also prevail in estimations which do not control for
interbank claims.
(iv) Synthesis
Summarizing the results of the industry-specific bank lending functions, the evidence shows
that bank lending growth is industry specific, being driven by cyclical changes in industry
output growth and industry inflation and hence by factors of industry-specific bank credit
demand. We find significant differences in the bank lending effects of industry output growth,
industry inflation, and monetary policy changes between industries. Furthermore, regardless
of the industry, the evidence lends weak support that banks differ in their lending response to
monetary policy changes. If at all, cross-bank differences in the monetary policy response of
bank lending are primarily attributable to bank asset size effects. Overall, it appears that bank
47Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003) do not report evidence for short-term lending but for aggregate
bank credit. Because our results for aggregate and short-term lending do not differ, we generalize our results
when comparing them with earlier studies and do not make a distinction between short-term and aggregate
lending.
29
lending growth predominantly depends on bank credit demand and on the relative importance
of industries in a bank's loan portfolio.
6.4 Robustness Tests
In order to determine the robustness of the empirical findings, we modify the structure of
the benchmark specification (1) along several lines. Table C.1 in appendix C summarizes
the different models. To conserve on space, we only provide a verbal description of the
corresponding evidence.48 One set of estimations eliminates output growth and inflation from
the benchmark model to test whether industry demand factors dwarf the bank lending effects
of monetary policy changes. The test is motivated by the evidence from the benchmark
model according to which bank lending growth is predominantly determined by industry
output growth and industry inflation rather than by monetary policy. The results for the
modified model confirm those for the benchmark specification. We find the magnitude of
the direct monetary policy effects on bank lending to be in the range suggested by the
benchmark specification. The evidence in favor of credit channel effects of monetary policy
through bank lending is still comparatively strong for asset size, but relatively weak for the
remaining bank characteristics. Furthermore, the coefficient estimates from the augmented
specification closely resemble those from the benchmark model.
Another set of estimations re-estimates the benchmark model with more than one bank char-
acteristic. One specification interacts each bank characteristic individually with monetary
policy (Table C.1, model B), while a second model interacts two bank characteristics with
each other as well as with monetary policy (Table C.1, model C).49 We include more than
one bank characteristic simultaneously to control for the possibility that models with only
one bank characteristic report evidence that also captures the effects associated with other
characteristics. More precisely, we take into account the likely interdependence between bank
asset size and liquidity and bank capitalization and liquidity: large or better capitalized banks
might be more liquid than small or poorly capitalized banks. For Germany, the interdepen-
dence may also extend to asset size and interbank claims. Worms (2003) and Ehrmann et
al. (2003) have shown that interbank claims attenuate the effects of asset size and domi-
nate the liquidity or capitalization effects of monetary policy. Although the present evidence
illustrates that asset size explains the average interest rate response of banks in estimations
which do not control for interbank claims, interbank claims may still capture part of the size
effects. However, when including more than one bank characteristic, the models with single
48The coefficient estimates for all robustness tests are available on request. Note, existing studies on the
bank lending effects of monetary policy also test for the differential response of bank lending by eliminating
the effect of time-variant variables on bank lending with either time dummies or macroeconomic variables (cf.
Gambacorta, 2003; Ehrmann et al., 2003; Worms, 2003). We abstain from capturing time effects with time
dummies since they capture the level effect of those variables we are particularly interested in, i.e., monetary
policy and the proxy variables of bank credit demand.
49See Ehrmann et al. (2003) and Worms (2003) for a description of the model.
30
and double interactions yield evidence which largely confirms the findings of the benchmark
specification. Bank lending growth is predominantly determined by bank credit demand and
not by monetary policy or the distributional effects of monetary policy. The strength of the
underlying effects significantly differs between industries.
The evidence from the model with more than one single interaction term (Table C.1, model
B) suggests the independence of the effects associated with each single bank characteris-
tic. For example, when significant, the effects associated with bank capitalization are still
comparatively strong, while bank size effects are relatively small. In fact, the strength of sig-
nificant bank size, capitalization, liquidity, and interbank effects does not vary much between
the benchmark and augmented model. We therefore conclude that distributional effects of
monetary policy reveal size and capitalization effects which are not driven by interbank claims
or bank liquidity. Similarly, interbank assets do not influence the evidence on bank liquidity
effects. For most bank lending functions, interbank assets are statistically insignificant and
broad liquidity effects reflect the effects associated with narrow liquidity.
The model with double interaction terms (Table C.1, model C) tests whether cross-bank
differences in the interest rate response of bank lending depend on the interdependence of
effects associated with (i) interbank claims and either bank asset size, capitalization, or
liquidity and (ii) liquidity and either bank asset size or capitalization. The hypothesis is that
the effect of interbank claims or liquidity on the interest rate response of bank lending is
smaller for large and better capitalized banks. Summarizing the results, we find the double
interaction terms to be statistically insignificant in almost all industry bank lending functions.
The only significant responses are recorded for estimations with interbank claims and either
asset size, capitalization, or narrow liquidity. When significant, the evidence tends to be
inconsistent with expectations: interbank effects on bank lending are smaller for (i) small
banks (machinery and transport equipment sector), (ii) poorly capitalized banks (electrical
and optical equipment sector), and (iii) less liquid banks (construction, services, wood and
paper producing sector). Anticipated relationships prevail for the grand total of industries.
We find the interbank effects of monetary policy on bank lending to be smaller for large
banks. In addition, interbank effects are smaller for liquid banks in estimations for the rubber
and plastic and machinery and transport equipment sector.
As an alternative test we ask whether the results are sensitive to the way we define the
explanatory variables of the benchmark specification. The model in equation (1) includes
industry-specific bank lending, output, and inflation without weighing each of these compo-
nents by the corresponding bank-specific aggregate. In expressing loans in absolute terms, we
follow Kishan and Opiela (2000), Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004), Ehrmann et al. (2003),
Worms (2003), H¨
ulsewig, Mayer, and Wollmersh¨
auser (2005), among others. In reality, banks
operate portfolios, with lending to industry i being part of a diversification strategy. The rel-
ative importance of industries in a bank's portfolio hence differs. In order to control for
differences in the importance of industries, we redefine the industry-specific variables relative
31
to the aggregate (Table C.1, model D). Doing so, we do not only control for differences in the
relative importance of industries, but also for structural breaks which result from redefinitions
in the composition of industries. Furthermore, we can also control for the effect of those
mergers which do not appear as outliers. When using ratios, merger-driven jumps in lending
are ameliorated or even eliminated. The results do not differ qualitatively from those of the
benchmark specification: bank lending growth is determined by bank credit demand rather
than by monetary policy. Conclusions regarding the distributional effects of monetary policy
on bank lending do not differ much between the base and augmented specification.
So far, the robustness checks involve structural changes of the base specification, using
data for the sample period 1992:1-2002:4. This sample period captures years of exceptional
circumstances as caused by German re-unification. Particular to this process is above average
credit demand by all industries (cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, 1996). In order to assess the
sensitivity of the results to re-unification effects, we also estimate the benchmark specification
for the period 1995:1-2002:4 (Table C.1, model E). For almost all industries, the results for the
shorter time period do not differ qualitatively from those obtained for the longer time period.
The only exception is the manufacturing industry. In contrast to the long sample period, bank
lending to this sector is predicted to expand in response to industry inflation and to contract in
reaction to higher interest rates. Conclusions regarding the existence of bank lending effects
of monetary policy also change for bank asset size. In contrast to the long sample, the interest
rate response of bank lending does no longer decrease with asset size, but increases. The
relationships for output growth and the remaining bank characteristics do not change. The
evidence for manufacturing is hence influenced by German re-unification. Visual inspection of
the data shows that the results are driven by differences in the time-series pattern of inflation
during 1992-1993 and 1994-2002. Manufacturing prices were constant during 1992-1993,
while the share of short-term credit to manufacturing declined. Manufacturing prices only
increased as of 1994.
Overall, conclusions as to the response of bank lending to changes in monetary policy and
bank credit demand are robust to alternative model specifications. Regardless of the model,
we find strong evidence that credit supply effects of monetary policy are small. Significant
cross-industry differences still prevail, which demonstrates that the sensitivity of a bank's
credit portfolio to monetary policy changes or economic conditions clearly depends on the
industry composition of a credit portfolio.
7 Conclusion
This paper has used a unique dataset with bank-level data on bank balance sheet items and
bank industry lending to investigate the bank lending effects of bank credit demand and
monetary policy for Germany over the period 1992:1-2002:4. In contrast to existing work on
the credit channel effects of monetary policy, we explicitly focused on the industry effects
32
of bank lending and estimated bank lending functions for eight industries at the one-digit
industry level and for five sub-sectors of the manufacturing industry at the two-digit industry
level. The bank lending functions were defined for aggregate and short-term lending and
for five individual banking groups. In line with existing studies, we used bank asset size,
capitalization, liquidity, and short-term interbank claims as proxy variables of cross-bank
differences in the severity of information asymmetries.
Our empirical findings lend strong support to the existence of industry effects of bank lending:
industries are the more important source of variation in the bank lending effects of bank credit
demand and monetary policy, with strong effects arising from industry output growth and
industry inflation. Banking group effects are comparatively weak. This in turn suggests that
the institutional setting of the German banking system might be a relatively unimportant
determinant of bank lending growth. The evidence lends mixed support to the credit channel
theory according to which cross-bank differences in the interest rate response of bank lending
can be explained with cross-bank heterogeneities in bank asset size, capitalization, liquidity,
and short-term interbank claims. Again, the conclusions are very sensitive to the choice
of industry and also depend on the choice of bank characteristic and banking group. We
conclude that the credit channel effects of monetary policy through bank lending are weak
and that the industry composition of bank credit portfolios determines bank lending growth
and - more important from an economic policy perspective - the effectiveness of monetary
policy.
We expect that the evidence in favor of industry effects of bank lending would also prevail
in estimations which solve one major limitation of the present analysis. We estimated a
reduced-form model which imposes the simplifying assumption that monetary policy does
not immediately affect bank credit demand, but only bank credit supply. That is, we do not
control for the sensitivity of loan demand to monetary policy changes. Of course, bank credit
demand is likely to respond to monetary policy changes because of, for example, balance
sheet effects. Unfortunately, we can only acknowledge, but not address this shortcoming.

The empirical analysis does not include all industries individually, but also combinations of
sectors. An aggregation of sectors is necessitated by the definition of industry sectors in the
Bundesbank borrower statistics. The following industries are treated as a single unit: (i)
wood and paper; (ii) coke and chemicals; (iii) machinery and transport equipment.
With few exceptions, monthly data on the industry production index and industry price
index are compiled from the New Cronos database of Eurostat (NC). The monthly data
are converted into quarterly data. Industry data on agriculture, services, wholesale and retail
trade, finance and insurance, and transport and communication are obtained from the German
statistical office (GSO).
Data on bank characteristics are compiled from the Bundesbank's monthly bank balance
sheet statistics. The following variables are used:
· Total assets (TA)
· Bank capital (K)
· Liquidity (A)
34
Bank capital includes subscribed capital, reserves, capital represented by participation rights
and the fund for general banking risk. Liquidity is defined as the sum of cash; balances with
the central banks; treasury bills, treasury certificates, and similar debt instruments issued
by public authorities (eligible for refinancing); debt securities; shares and other variable-yield
securities; claims on credit institutions with an agreed maturity or redeemable at notice of
one year or less (short-term interbank claims).50
Data on bank-specific lending to eight main industries and nine sub-sectors of the manufactur-
ing industry are compiled from the quarterly borrower statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
50The determinants of liquidity are ranked according to liquidity. From the top to the bottom, liquidity
declines. See B¨
uschgen (1998, chapter 4.B) for details.

Annex B Variable Description
The vector of bank characteristics Xb
in equation (1) includes variables related to bank
efficiency and profitability: total assets (TA), liquidity (A), and bank capital (K). In line
with existing studies (cf. Ehrmann et al., 2003; Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004; Worms,
2003), the level of bank-specific capital Capb
, broad liquidity Bliqb
, narrow liquidity Nliqb

and short-term interbank claims Ibkb

respectively. The bank characteristics are expressed in terms of total assets to de-trend these
series. To this end, we assume that bank capitalization, liquidity, and interbank claims follow
similar trends as asset size. Total assets (TA) are also normalized with respect to the mean
across all banks, but de-trending requires the normalization for each single data point. This
yields the following measure of bank asset size

Normalization with respect to the average across all banks means that the indicator variables
Size, Cap, Bliq, Nliq, and Ibk sum to zero over all observations. Because of this property, the
interaction terms in equation (1) in the main text are on average equal to zero. In addition,
the coefficient estimate 1j
directly reflects the average effect of monetary policy on bank
credit growth.

Notes: Assets (panel 1) are expressed in logarithm. The balance sheet positions
capitalization (panel 2), liquidity (panel 3), interbank claims (panel 4), and total
lending to non-banks (panel 5) are expressed as share of total assets. Lending to non-
banks includes lending to domestic businesses, private households, government, and
foreign non-banks. Lending to industries combines bank credit supply to businesses
and self-employed. Aggregate lending to industries (panel 6) is expressed as share
of total non-bank lending. Short-term lending to industries (panel 7) is expressed as
share of aggregate lending to industries. The descriptive statistics for savings banks
are for public rather than for private savings banks. The aggregate banking group
only consists of the primary institutions of the commercial, savings, and cooperative

Notes: Agr = agriculture, Enr = energy and mining, Con = construction, Trd = wholesale and retail trade, Trt = transport and
communication, Fin = finance and insurance, Ser = services, Mfg = manufacturing, C&C = chemicals and coke, R&P = rubber

equipment, W&P = wood and paper, Txt = textiles, Fd = food. Aggregate (short-term) lending to industry i is expressed relative to
aggregate (short-term) lending to the grand total of industries. The data are from the quarterly borrower statistics of the Deutsche
Bundesbank. For each banking group, the sum of the means deviates from one due to rounding and due to the use of unbalanced sets
of bank-quarter observations. Besides missing observations, the cross-industry differences in the number of bank-quarter observations
also result from the removal of outliers (see section 5).

Notes: Columns 3 to 6 report the results for the hypothesis that the long-run elasticities do not differ between bank asset size,
bank capitalization, narrow liquidity, broad liquidity, and short-term interbank claims. The ANOVA test statistics are reported for
short-term lending by the aggregate banking group. Columns 7 to 10 report the results for the hypothesis that the mean values
do not differ in estimations for aggregate and short-term bank credit. The corresponding evidence is reported for estimations with
bank asset size as bank characteristic. In this table, the within groups variation refers to the variation between industries.

Notes: IP, Price, and IR denote real industry-specific output growth, industry inflation, and the change in the money market interest rate,
respectively. 'Char' stands for the bank characteristic, which is either bank asset size (Size), capitalization (Cap), broad liquidity (Bliq), narrow liquidity
(Nliq), or short-term interbank claims (Ibk). The dynamic panel model is estimated with the fixed effects estimator. The parentheses contain White-
period standard errors (Arellano, 1987). , ,  denote the statistical significance at the one, five, and ten percent level, respectively. AR(1) and
AR(2) are the p-values associated with tests of first- and second-order serial correlation of the residuals (cf. section 4.2).
