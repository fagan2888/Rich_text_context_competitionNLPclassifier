Introduction
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has become
known as a prerequisite for tumors, including cervical can-
cer.1 There are convincing data that angiotensin II (Ang II)
stimulates cell proliferation in human cancer cell lines2,3
and induces angiogenesis via the upregulation of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is one of the
most potent angiogenic factors,4,5 via angiotensin type 1
(AT1) receptor stimulation. Thus, much attention has been
paid to the blockade of the tumoral AT1 receptor as a novel
molecular-targeted therapy. Olmesartan is a novel, strong
and long-acting AT1 receptor antagonist. It is speculated
that olmesartan might have capacity for the inhibition of
cell growth and cell proliferation.6 These studies create the
potential mechanism that olmesartan can suppress the
angiogenesis and cell proliferation in cervical cancer.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that play a prominent role in tumor genesis, differentiation
and proliferation. miRNAs regulate gene expression by
binding to 3' untranslated region (UTR). These genes are
involved in a variety of biological cell processes. Current
studies showed that miRNA acts as an oncogene or tumor
suppressor gene in all kinds of cancer. miR-21 is one of the
well-understood onco-miRNAs that promotes cancer pro-
liferation, invasion and inhibition of tumor apoptosis by
targeting programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2
(BCL2), tropomyosin 1 (alpha) (TPM1), tumor protein P53
(P53), and the transforming growth factor beta (TGF )
miR-205 mediates the inhibition
of cervical cancer cell proliferation
using olmesartan

Abstract
Objective: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has become known as a prerequisite for tumor angiogenesis that
is now recognized as a crucial step in the development of tumors, including cervical cancer. The Ang II-AT1R pathway is
known to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, regulating RNAs that
participate in tumor genesis, differentiation and proliferation. The current study focused on the anti-tumor mechanism
of olmesartan, a novel angiotensin II antagonist, on cervical cancer cells.
Materials and methods: qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to demonstrate the effect of olmesartan on miR-205
and VEGF-A expression. miR-205 mimics and VEGF-A shRNA plasmid were separately transfected into HeLa and Siha
cells to further validate the function of miR-205 and VEGF-A in cervical cancer cell proliferation.
Results: It was found that olmesartan could upregulate miR-205 and inhibit VEGF-A expression in HeLa and Siha cells.
In addition, VEGF-A was proven to be a target gene of miR-205.
Conclusion: This result provides a new idea on the anti-tumor mechanism of olmesartan, which may be used as a novel
therapeutic target of cervical cancer.

family.7­9 miR-10b can also promote tumor invasion of
breast cancer.10 Previous studies have shown that miR-205
is a tumor-suppressing onco-miRNA. In human prostate
cancer, miR-205 shows anti-tumor function by targeting
protein kinase C.11 Further, miR-205 inhibits breast cancer
proliferation and promotes renal cancer cell apoptosis.12
VEGF is a member of the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF)/VEGF group. VEGF-A is a glycosylated
mitogen that specifically acts on endothelial cells and has
various effects, including angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.
Previous studies indicate that VEGF is a positive regulator
of tumor growth that promotes tumor migration and inva-
sion, and inhibits tumor apoptosis.13­15 It can be secreted
by tumor cells acting on the endothelial cells of existing
blood vessels to promote new blood vessel formation.
Overexpression of VEGF has been detected in almost all
human cancers investigated, such as glioma, prostate, lung,
breast, renal, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.16­21 Therefore,
VEGF is considered a potential therapy for cancer.
In the current study, olmesartan exhibited a high anti-
proliferation activity against cervical cancer. It was also
found that olmesartan could promote miR-205 expression
and inhibit VEGF-A expression. In addition, knocking
down miR-205 and overexpression of VEGF-A can modu-
late the olmesartan sensitivity of cervical cancer. This result
provides a new mechanism of olmesartan anti-tumor effect.
Material and methods
Cell culture and olmesartan treatment
HeLa and Siha cells were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and grown
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). All cultures were main-
tained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
carbon dioxide. Olmesartan (2.0 mM, Daiichi Sankyo
Pharmaceutical) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide just
before use. The cells were cultured with and without Ang
II (0.1 M) or olmesartan at the time of seeding to examine
olmesartan influence on cervical cancer cells.
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Quantification of miR-205 expression levels was assessed
via qRT-PCR using specific TaqMan® assays according to
the instructions of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems).
U6 RNA was used as normalizer.
Proliferation assay
The transfected cells were seeded in 96- or six-well plates
and cultured for 48 hours. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was
performed to test cell proliferation. For clonogenic assay,
cells were plated at a final concentration of 200 cells/ml.
Colonies were counted after staining the cells with 0.1%
crystal violet within 10 days after plating. Each experi-
ment was conducted in triplicate.
Invasion assay
Cell invasion assay was performed using Transwell cell
culture inserts (Corning). Cells (1 × 105) were cultured
onto a Matrigel-coated membrane matrix present in the
insert of a 24-well culture plate for 24 hours at 37°C. At
the end of incubation, the noninvasive cells were removed.
Invasive cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and
photographed under microscope.
DNA construction
miR-205 mimics, control mimics, miR-205 locked nucleic
acids (LNA), and control LNAwere synthesized by Shanghai
Genepharma Co. Ltd. (China). VEGF-A-specific short hair-
pin RNAs (shRNAs) were generated using oligonucleotide
annealing and inserted into pSilencer 2.0 upon BamHI/
HindIII restriction. The shRNA sequence was as follows:

3';Reverse,5'-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACACAGACTCGC
GTTGCAAGTCTCTTGAACTTGCAACGCGAGTCTG
TGCG-3'. VEGF-A CDS and full-length VEGF-A with tar-
get 3' UTR fragment were obtained from HEK293 cell
cDNA library and constructed into pcDNA3.1 plasmid
using BamHI/EcoRI restriction. The primers of VEGF-A
CDS were as follows:
Forward,5'-CGCGGATCCACCATGAACTTTCTGCT

The primers of full-length VEGF-A with target 3' UTR were
as follows:

Reverse,5'-CCGGAATTCAGTGCTCTGCGCAGAG
TCTC-3'. The oligonucleotide (1 to 180) of VEGF-A 3' UTR
was synthesized and inserted into pmirGLO luciferase
plasmid using PmeI and XbaI restrictions.
Western blot
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche). Whole-cell
lysates were analyzed using Western blot with anti-VEGF-A
Yue et al. 3
polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a ratio of 1:1000 after being
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phos-
phate dehydrogenase (GADPH) was used as a loading con-
trol and was detected using an anti-GADPH polyclonal
antibody (Abcam). Enhanced chemiluminescence method
was used to determine protein expression.
Statistical analysis
All data in the current study were evaluated using SPSS
16.0 (SPSS Inc, USA). Data were presented as mean ±
SEM and were compared by Student t test or analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-Student­Newman­
Keuls (SNK) q test as appropriate. Differences were con-
sidered significant at p < 0.05.
Results
Effect of olmesartan on VEGF-A and miR-205
expression exposed to Ang II in cervical cancer
cells
HeLa and Siha exposed toAng II for 24 hours significantly
increased cell VEGF-A expression and decreased miR-205
expression compared with control cells (p < 0.05). After
olmesartan treatment, HeLa and Siha VEGF-A expression
was significantly downregulated (p < 0.05) and miR-205
was significantly upregulated (p < 0.05). See Figure 1.
Olmesartan inhibits cervical cancer cell
proliferation and regulates miR-205 and
VEGF-A expression
MTT screening analysis of olmesartan demonstrated a
strong inhibitory effect on HeLa and Siha cells (Figure 2).
HeLa and Siha cells were treated with increasing concen-
trations of olmesartan. A concentration-dependent inhibi-
tion of proliferation was evident at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5
mM, as demonstrated using an MTT proliferation assay.
MiR-205 and VEGF-A expression levels were identified
using miRNA-specific RT-PCR and Western blot analysis
to determine the mechanism of olmesartan inhibition of
cervical cancer cells. miR-205 was significantly upregu-
lated and VEGF was significantly downregulated after
treatment with 0.5­3.0 mM olmesartan.

further the function of miR-205 and VEGF-A in cervical
cancer cell proliferation. Colony formation assay and inva-
sion assay were performed to assess the effect on cervical
cancer cells. As shown in Figure 3, invasive and colony
formation capability was strongly inhibited after miR-205
overexpression or VEGF-A downregulation compared
with the control.
miR-205 targets VEGF-A
Bioinformatics database (Targetscan) and luciferase
reporter assay were used to examine the relationship
between miR-205 and VEGF-A. As shown in Figure 4,
VEGF-A expression level and luciferase activity were
downregulated, whereas transfected HeLa cells with miR-
205 mimics were compared with the control mimics.
Further, transfecting VEGF-A CDS plasmid in miR-
205-overexpressed HeLa cells has a greater promotion of
proliferation than the expression plasmid of VEGF-A with
miR-205 targeting the 3' UTR region.
miR-205 LNA and VEGF-A contribute to
olmesartan drug resistance
Upregulation of miR-205 was found in olmesartan-treated
cervical cancer cells, and inhibition of cell proliferation
was mediated by VEGF-A. MiR-205 LNA or VEGF-A
expression plasmids were transfected into olmesartan-
treated HeLa and Siha cells to assess the effects of miR-
205andVEGFAonolmesartan-dependentcellproliferation
inhibition on cervical cancer cells. Upregulation of
VEGF-A expression and knock-down of miR-205 expres-
sion level can significantly promote the proliferation of
olmesartan-treated cervical cancer cells compared with
controls (Figure 5).
Discussion
miR-205 is a well-known tumor suppressor in almost all
cancers. However, despite the role of miR-205 in cancer22,23
and the dedication of researchers to the validation of the

molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development,
the role of miR-205 in cancer drug therapy remains largely
unexplored. In the current study, results indicate the dys-
regulation of miR-205 in cervical cancer cells treated by
olmesartan. Genes involved in cancer anti-drug progress
include oncogene and anti-tumor genes.Although miRNAs
are small non-coding RNAs, they can control tumor gene-
sis, proliferation and differentiation by regulating cancer-
related genes. Previous studies have shown that miR-20a
contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in colorectal
adenocarcinoma by targeting BCL2 interacting protein 2
(BNIP2).24 High expression levels of miR-21 contribute to
breast cancer drug resistance of Trastuzumab.25 In the pre-
sent study, upregulation of miR-205 in cervical cancer cells
treated with olmesartan was compared with untreated cells.
In addition, VEGF-A as a target gene of miR-205 was vali-
dated using luciferase reporter assay. Overexpressions of
miR-205 and knockdown of VEGF-A contributed to olme-
sartan-induced anti-tumor effect on cervical cancer cells.
Although early studies by Xie and Ma26,27 showed that the
expression of miR-205 was higher in cervical cancer tissue
and cell lines ME-180, C4I and CaSki, while low expres-
sion/barely detectable levels were found in HeLa, SW756,
SiHa and C33A. This was similar to our results.
Several in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors had anti-
tumor properties.28,29 Antiangiogenic drugs (ADs) are
one of the key components of frontline therapy in cur-
rent combination regimens for the treatment of various
human cancers. Clinical experiences gained from han-
dling different types of cancers demonstrate that ADs,
such as sorafenib, bevacizumab, and sunitinib, in combi-
nation with chemotherapy, often produce significant but
modest survival benefits.30,31 These clinical findings
have raised several important issues regarding the bene-
ficial mechanisms of antiangiogenic therapy in cancer
patients.32­34 In the current study, olmesartan inhibits
tumor cell invasion, and it also has the capability to

suppress VEGF-A secretion. Further studies have shown
that through miR-205, olmesartan can regulate VEGF-A
expression. They also suggest that VEGF-A may be a
regulation target of miR-205, which reveals more about
the molecular mechanism of olmesartan as an AD. See
Figure 6.
The current study suggests that olmesartan inhibits cer-
vical cancer cell proliferation and may serve as a therapeu-
tic option against cervical cancer that might be mediated
by upregulating miR-205 and regulate the expression level
of VEGF-A. A new mechanism of Ang II receptor blocker
(ARB), olmesartan, on anti-tumor therapy was illustrated,
which may be useful for further application for human cer-
vical cancer treatment.
