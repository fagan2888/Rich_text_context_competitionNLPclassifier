Introduction
Religious authorities are influential international actors.
They possess political accountability, they exert political
influence, and in some countries they even control political
offices. Public consideration for religious leaders can easily
surpass public attention to politicians, especially if the
issues tackled by their statements have broad audiences that
go beyond traditional political constituencies. Yet, little is
known on when these actors speak politically and how their
political pronouncements relate to the statements of secular
authorities.Atypical argument is that certain religious lead-
ers have more political personalities or clearer political
interests. For example, Pope Francis is often considered a
more political pontiff than others before him.1 However, to
date there is no systematic evidence that either confirms or
rejects this common wisdom.
Specifically, studies of the political announcements of
spiritual leaders are virtually nonexistent. This research gap
is puzzling, given the agreement that the positions of reli-
gious institutions have powerful effects on voters' ideology
(Harris, 1994; Inglehart and Norris, 2004). Even in the
study of international relations, where morality and norms
are deemed as important determinants of political prefer-
ences, analyses of the statements of spiritual leaders are de
facto missing. Considering the global popularity of the
church and the politically dividing topics that relate to the
sphere of religion, it seems natural to ask under which con-
ditions religious leaders are more likely to release political
statements.
Tackling these questions, in this article I argue that reli-
gious authorities are more likely to issue political messages
when secular institutions are unwilling or incapable to take
clear political positions. In order to test my argument, I con-
centrate on the high-level statements of the Roman Catholic
church presented by the Vatican.2 I focus on the Vatican for
the following reasons. Theoretically, the clear spiritual role
of the Roman church permits to assume that its leaders are
independently motivated from other political institutions. In
other words, the preferences of the Roman church should be
exogenous from secular political interests, because the
Vatican commands that religious leaders do not enter pro-
fessional politics and vice versa.3 Empirically, studying the

Abstract
Political scientists are increasingly interested in the impact of religious authority on modern politics. However, little
attention has been paid to the conditions under which religious leaders are more likely to speak politically. Tackling this
question, this article argues that religious authorities should issue political statements at the outbreak of international
crises, when secular institutions are unwilling or incapable of taking clear political positions. I test this argument focusing
on the Roman Vatican through a quantitative text analysis of the papal encyclicals from 1958 until today. Latent topic
models indicate that political themes systematically emerge in the papal documents and that the timing of the more
political encyclicals correlate with years in which international crises break out. The findings have implications for the
understanding of the modern relations between state and church and the political mobilization of religion today.

2 Research and Politics 
Vatican allows relying on a body of written documents that
to date have never been studied from a rigorous political
science perspective. Leveraging state-of-the-art text analy-
sis methods, and specifically topic modelling, I present an
analysis of all of the papal encyclicals since the end of World
War II. My analysis identifies the political terminology that
emerges in these ecclesiastic documents and indicates with
precision which documents are more concentrated on politi-
cal themes. Moreover, the new data allow me to trace at
which points in time the church has released more politi-
cally relevant statements, thus providing evidence for the
extent to which the Vatican is sensitive to the void of global
action on pressing political issues.
The results indicate the scope of "politics ex cathedra":
the Vatican has dedicated roughly one third of its post-war
encyclicals to the political themes of social justice, civil rights
and economic development. In addition, the findings suggest
that the timing of the more political encyclicals follows regu-
lar patterns, as the more political documents correlate with
years in which clear international crises break out. The evi-
dence indicates that strong political statements by this high-
profile religious authority are anti-cyclical to states'positions
on political problems. Put differently, the church has histori-
cally filled a void of secular leadership incapable or unwilling
to address political change. These results speak to the role of
religious authorities in a politically polarized world and indi-
cate that the Vatican's contemporary political signals are con-
sistent with a long tradition of engagement at the occurrence
of political crises. This is contrary to the claims that some
popes are more political than others and that their writings are
systematically different from each other.4
Religious authority and global
governance
Since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, sovereign nation
states have been the central international decision-makers.
Even today, in an interdependent world where political
problems systematically jump borders and increase scale,
states are the polities in charge of enacting global policies.
However, states are not the only actors maneuvering the
international system. As a large body of research indicates,
the nation-centric understanding of international politics
does not exclude the political relevance of non-state actors
(Drezner, 2007). Religious authorities, together with corpo-
rations, non-governmental organizations and social move-
ments, lack the international legal status of states, but they
possess the power to tilt international politics towards their
preferences. This power takes different forms. On the one
hand, power is leveraging material influence and mobilizing
masses (Dahl, 1957; Keohane and Nye, 1977). On the other
hand, power is possessing legitimacy, which induces con-
formity and obedience (Barnett and Duvall, 2005; Büthe,
2004). Using both types of influence, non-governmental
actors behave as lobbies to states, which are the only
sovereign territorial institutions that can enact their favoured
policies. However, the relationship between the political
preferences of these actors and traditional governments is
still a point of discussion. It is open to question whether
these authorities echo states' positions or have genuine,
independent political stands. Relatedly, it is unclear when
they would decide to take vocal positions on some specific
political issues.
The political positioning of religious authorities is partic-
ularly puzzling due to the historical role of religion in inter-
national relations. Despite the nominal separation of state
and church in the Middle Ages, the two camps have inter-
acted substantively in modern times (Bueno De Mesquita,
2000). For example, Christian communities were involved in
diplomatic affairs at the end of the 19th century with the
emergence of numerous new European nation states.
Furthermore, after World War II, many religious denomina-
tions embraced modern political attitudes in their practices
due to several important reforms.5 These reforms coincided
with religious leaders starting to make explicit statements on
government morality and political action (Stark, 2015).
However, in spite of anecdotal evidence on these political
stands, little light has been shed on how these positions have
manifested themselves and, more importantly, how they are
related to states' positions on global politics. The answer to
this question depends on how one perceives the relation
between state and church. To the extent that states' govern-
ment and religious leadership are two complementary
sources of political mobilization, their political force should
emerge uniformly, and perhaps at the same time. To the
extent that these sets of actors substitute each other, when-
ever one is in charge of a political issue, the other is not, and
vice versa. Hence, it is up to debate whether political state-
ments of religious authorities are either cyclical or anti-cycli-
cal to the statements of formal political institutions.
I argue that spiritual leaders are more likely to take vocal
political stands on international issues when states have dif-
ficulties or constraints in addressing them. This is due to a
set of reasons that can be linked to rational choice theory
and the logic of credible commitments. Firstly, spiritual
leaders should be more inclined to substitute secular lead-
ers because they are actors that want to maximize their suc-
cess while minimizing their costs of action. Success
corresponds to maintaining, and possibly increasing, the
number of church members. Thus, maximizing success
implies giving voice and anticipating the worries of the
average congregant. By contrast, minimizing costs means
eluding reputation loss and avoiding competition with other
institutions. So, it is plausible that religious leaders want to
increase the resources spent addressing a political issue that
a significant number of followers deem as relevant if doing
so strengthens the reputation of the church. By contrast,
religious leaders should ignore political issues that are not
at the heart of their audiences and that compete with other
authorities in charge. If stressing an issue with clear and
Genovese 3
determinate language means marking political influence
(Edelman, 1985), then religious leaders should release
political statements only if this action can solidify their
moral power. If public audiences are disinterested or if they
are more responsive to the guide of other institutions, reli-
gious leaders are better off focusing on spiritual problems.
Secondly, spiritual leaders should be more likely to take
political stands on issues that states fail to address because,
like secular leaders, religious authorities are bound to cred-
ible commitments, which constrain them about which
issues to pick and how to perpetrate them. Differently from
secular leaders, however, religious authorities become
more credible when morality becomes stronger vis-à-vis
other motivations of political action (Tavits, 2007). When
formal political institutions are ambiguous about a political
problem, morality may matter more for the public, so the
church should respond to an increased demand for moral
authority with a more political position. Consequently, if
secular leaders are incapable or unwilling to act on a par-
ticular issue, then the religious leader's commitment to that
issue should be even more credible.
To place this argument in a more specific context, con-
sider the politics of international public good provision,
such as security agreements or environmental cooperation.
When states have the domestic political capability to push
the international agenda forward, then international collec-
tive action is feasible and the state's intention to address the
public goods is credible. However, when domestic political
interests are not aligned with international agreement,
cooperation is unfeasible. In that instance, religious author-
ities are relatively more free to work on the international
agenda and address the externalities of public good failure.
After all, the church seeks to influence secular politics and
maneuver social policies to maintain, and possible extend,
public credibility and followers' attention. Hence, it is in
the church's interest to tackle issues that affect their trans-
national audience, such as global injustice, international
conflict and world poverty. This leads me to expect that
when national governments do not take a position on press-
ing political issues, religious authorities substitute them in
order to fill their political void. Surely political statements
are also a function of the personal idiosyncrasies of the
leaders in charge. For example, the leader's place of origin
and his intrinsic issue salience may matter a great deal for
the framing of some topics. Nonetheless, political failures
should be relevant for triggering political discussions
within spiritual organizations, ceteris paribus. Thus, I
expect that international crises that weaken the political
power of secular institutions should drive the political
statements of international spiritual authorities.
Note that my argument implies that in times of crises the
church may produce political statements to influence both
secular authorities and the public. The link between crises
and the church's political statements should hold whether
or not people are already sensitive to political messages, as
long as there is a political problem that will affect them.
Also, my argument de facto predicts a negative correlation
between crises and more spiritual topics. If religious
authorities are a `thermometer' of public opinion and if
they have incentives to anticipate public concerns, they
should be less interested in engaging politics when govern-
ments and people are not affected by the consequences of
any crisis. This means that, while more political themes
should emerge in religious communications at crucial his-
torical moments, more spiritual themes should feature the
church's messages when the world is sufficiently governed
by secular authorities, in the absence of a crisis.
Data selection, research design and
method
To test my argument, I concentrate on the body of commu-
nications of the modern Roman Catholic church of the
Holy See. The Catholic church represents a special interna-
tional icon of religious authority. In 1870 the Papal territo-
ries were incorporated in the new Kingdom of Italy, which
ended the church's millennial temporal power. That same
year corresponded to the First Vatican Council that resulted
in a first breakaway with the Old Catholic Church. In 1958
the Second Vatican Council started a series of reforms that
turned the Holy See into what it is today. But despite the
Vatican's specific historical developments, its relations
with secular politics should be comparable with other mod-
ern religious authorities. For example, His Holiness the
Dalai Lama and the Gran Imam of Egypt are considered the
highest authority in Buddhist and Sunni Islam communi-
ties, respectively.6 In this light, the Vatican's structures and
audiences resemble other religious denominations and, in
principle, guarantee the external validity of investigating its
messages vis-à-vis modern politics.
In order to perform a rigorous analysis of the nature and
recurrence of political themes in Vatican communications,
I choose a homogenous group of papal writings known as
encyclicals. I focus on these texts for two reasons. First,
differently from other papal documents such the apostolic
letters and homilies, encyclicals are written to instruct
bishops in all countries about a number of different mat-
ters. Therefore, they are quite comprehensive and their
readership is universal. Moreover, while papal notes and
speeches are published weekly, the pontiff defines when,
and under which circumstances, encyclicals should be
issued. These characteristics are useful for testing my
hypothesis that global politics should be systematically
addressed in papal documents at the outbreak of interna-
tional crises. At the same time, because all encyclicals
inevitably concern the Catholic doctrine, they should also
address issues directly related to faith and preaching. This
means that using the encyclicals allows me to avoid select-
ing on the dependent variables, i.e. contents and timing of
political papal messages.
4 Research and Politics 
For my analyses I collect all of the encyclicals from
1958 until 2015. Starting in 1958 is determined by the fact
that the Second Vatican Council radically changed the
goal of these papal communications. While beforehand
the papal writings were still mostly concerned with terri-
torial relations and spiritual dogmas, after 1958 the
Church revamped the purpose of encyclicals in order to
discuss "the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of
the teachings" of the church, in the words of Paul VI.7 The
34 documents are all available online in multiple lan-
guages. After the Second Vatican Council, Italian became
the vernacular of the Catholic Church, which means that
encyclicals since then have been written in Italian and
then translated in other languages. Hence, I selected the
original Italian versions.8
The analysis of the encyclicals could involve different
methods, from supervised human coding to less supervised
approaches. I choose to proceed with an automated content
analysis. There are two reasons why automated content
analysis is preferable, although not a perfect substitute, to
human coding in the case of the papal texts. The first reason
is one of practicality. While my text corpus is rather small,
the content is lengthy: a scarce few of the 34 encyclicals are
below 10 pages, while more than two thirds are more than
40 pages (the mean word count of the pre-processed docu-
ments is 32,169). A reliable human coding exercise would
have required at-the-time infeasible resources, and would
certainly cost months. By contrast, the automated content
analysis is highly efficient, reliable and economical.
Secondly, the choice of automated text analysis is sup-
ported by a small-scale validation experiment where I com-
pared the word associations generated by the automated
method with associations elicited through human input.
The results, which are reported in the Appendix and are fur-
ther discussed below, indicate that the automated analysis
can efficiently and substantively categorize the papal com-
munications, and human coding is neither more advanta-
geous nor necessary.
From the range of automated content analysis models, I
need a method that identifies the frequency and density of
political contents. If my argument is valid, encyclicals with
more politically dense topics should be issued after highly
contentious moments where states fail to coordinate political
action. Topic models can help distinguish political themes in
the encyclicals, because they can indicate which of them are
more or less "political" based on the latent topic structures. If
a topic that lacks politically meaningful words dominates an
encyclical, the topic model would estimate with a certain
likelihood that this is not a political text. By contrast, if a
topic characterized by politically meaningful words is more
dominant, the topic model would indicate that this encyclical
should be considered a more political text.
To conduct the core analysis of this study I rely on a
simple type of unsupervised topic model that finds sets of
words that characterize the documents' latent dimensions.
Following the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach
(Blei et al., 2003), I assume that each topic is characterized
by a distribution over words w. So, I first create the list of
words w used in the set of encyclicals. I then count w
ij
, the
number of times each word j appears in each encyclical i.
This creates a matrix summarizing the distribution of words,
where each word in each document has a certain weight.
Then, through the LDA estimation, I assess the systematic
correlations of words, which means that I inductively gener-
ate topics based on a probability distribution over terms.9 In
addition, I test the data with alternative topic models that
build off of the LDA tradition. In particular, the structural
topic model (STM) (Lucas et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2014),
allows me to explicitly estimate the relationship between the
encyclicals and information on crises.
Before moving to estimate the LDA topic model, the
number of topics needs to be specified. Following my theo-
retical argument, I expect the encyclicals to be mainly
divided between two dominant topics: a spiritual topic and
political topic. This binary choice is not a classical setup for
topic models, where usually multiple themes are analysed.
Commonly, the number of topics is better justified through
inductive topic discovery. To inductively explore the topic
density in my documents, I estimate two LDA-derived
measures: the "perplexity" score, where a lower value indi-
cates better generalization performance, and the marginal
likelihood, which is an auxiliary measure of model fit
(Chang et al., 2009). These metrics were calculated with 20
LDA models with a number of topics ( k ) set from 2
through 6 that are calculated using different initialization
values to ensure that my conclusions are not driven by the
starting parameters. The resultant perplexity and log-likeli-
hood values are plotted in Figure 1 for every initial set of
the starting parameters (grey) and each measure's respec-
tive mean values across all initializations (red). The plots
suggest that a number of topics above 2 does not drastically
improve the perplexity and log-likelihood measures,
because the estimated values of neither metric critically
changes moving from 2 to 6 topics. In other words, limiting
the analysis to two topics should not compromise the opti-
mality of the analysis, while it allows a more straight for-
ward test of the theory.
This conclusion can be also drawn from the estimation
of coherence and exclusivity scores (Roberts et al., 2014)
of a three-topic model. Although these scores are usually
employed to assess topic quality, comparing across topics
may indicate whether two topics capture enough of the
word variation. In fact, these dimensions provide informa-
tion on the consistency and differentiation of the topics.
Figure 2 shows that these scores mainly distinguish a more
"political" topic (Topic 1) from the other two topics (Topic
2 and 3), which combine more spiritual words. I interpret
this distance between the two clusters of topics as further
evidence that a two-topic model may capture an important
semantic distinction across the encyclicals.

Filling a political void: the case of the
papal encyclicals from 1958 until today
This article seeks to investigate whether the content of papal
encyclicals is correlated with international political crises. A
descriptive overview of the documents indicates that termi-
nology tilted towards international political issues is indeed
present in these texts: although the most frequent words, not
surprisingly, are god (dio) and church (chiesa), which are
repeated respectively 3,340 and 2,799 times, less-doctrinal
words such as work (lavoro) and politics (politic-) are
repeated, respectively, 833 and 440 times, making it to the
top 60 words of the corpus of encyclicals. Topic models help
shedding more rigorous light on this pattern.
I run the two-topic models 50 times using different ran-
dom initialization values to ensure that my conclusions are
not driven by the starting parameters. The LDA decomposes
the words of the 34 encyclicals into two clusters and provide
a list of words loading on each dimension. The two topics
are not exclusive in that some words are included on both
simultaneously. Nonetheless, there is a set of words that
consistently load on the first topic, such as church (chiesa),
Christ (cristo), faith (fede) and truth (verità). By contrast, a
second separate set of words load on a topic that refers to the
concepts of work (lavoro), development (sviluppo), social
(social-) and men (uomini). Evidently, the first topic seems
to capture the more "spiritual" papal messages, while the
second topic reflects the more "political" ones.
The LDA analysis also indicates which encyclicals load
most on which of the two topics in relative terms.As Figure 3
Figure 1. Model selection: model fit metrics by different
topic numbers. This figure illustrates the perplexity and
marginal likelihood scores calculated for the entire corpus of
encyclicals with an estimation repeated 20 times using different
initializations.
Figure 2. Model selection: semantic cohesiveness and exclusivity in three-topic model. This figure plots the semantic coherence
and exclusivity scores of the topics in an LDA model with three topics. On the exclusivity dimension the differences are small,
which indicates that the top words for the topics can appear within top words of other topics. On the semantic coherence
dimension the differences are larger, to indicate that the words that are most associated with the corresponding themes do not
occur equally within the documents. This is evidence that spiritual topics are more coherent, but also that the top words of the
political topic are differently consistent.
6 Research and Politics 
shows, roughly two thirds of the encyclicals group on the first
more spiritual topic. By contrast, one third are principally
marked by the words of the second more political topic. The
spiritual encyclicals are concentrated on the holy spirit (spir-
ito), the world (mondo), saints (sant-) and love (amor-),
among other themes. Contrastingly, the political encyclicals
place less emphasis on divinity and more on people (person-),
justice (giustizia), as well as economy (economi-) and society
(social-).At minimum, this is evidence that a stratum of polit-
ical language distinctly appears in a significant subset of
papal encyclicals across the years, and that the Vatican has
systematically focused on pressing international political
issues across time.
Note that this division of the post-1958 encyclicals is
generally in line with an extensive body of historical
Vatican studies. Accordingly, most political encyclicals
identified through my topic analysis belong to the unoffi-
cial group of documents commonly referred to as Catholic
Social Teaching. Nonetheless, the LDA is possibly more
nuanced than this categorization, as I evinced with a post-
estimation validation test. Following Grimmer and King
(2011), I assessed the quality of the clustering of encycli-
cals on the two topics revealed by the LDA analysis by
comparing it to a qualitative human categorization and the
Catholic Social Teaching classification.10 The differences
between the LDA-based clustering and the other approaches
is presented in the Appendix and shows that the LDA clus-
tering has higher quality than these alternative clusterings
of documents. Other validation tests that encompass a
Wordfish scaling evaluation (Slapin and Proksch, 2008)
indicate that the clustering patterns of the main LDA esti-
mations are robust.

with 50 random initialization values and indicates the relative loadings of encyclicals on spiritual (yellow) and political (green) topics.
Genovese 7
But is the timing of the more political encyclicals random
or is it in any way related to secular politics? To provide an
answer to this question, Figure 4 illustrates the schedule of a
set of political encyclicals in comparison to a number of rel-
evant international political events between 1958 and 2015.
Below the plotted time line I highlight the years of the his-
torical events, while above the line I report the encyclicals
published along those years. Through this figure, it becomes
clear that the political encyclicals systematically follow the
historical events. More precisely, more political encyclicals
are issued in the span of one to two years after the outbreak
of an international episode. For example, the 1963 Pacem in
Terris by John XXIII promptly followed the conflict between
the White House and the Kremlin during the Cuban Missile
Crisis. Not surprisingly, the encyclical indicates that con-
flicts "should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather
by negotiation" (126). Similarly, the Centesimus Annus con-
tains a message for states at the dawn of the post-Cold War
era. In the 1991 encyclical, John Paul II writes that "the free
market is the most efficient instrument for utilizing resources
and effectively responding to needs" and the state has the
duty of "directing the exercise of human rights in the eco-
nomic sectors" (34, 48). Comparably, more recent encycli-
cals make explicit reference to the costs of mishandling the
2008 global financial crisis. In the 2009 Caritas in Veritate,
Benedict XVI argues against an unregulated market econ-
omy and concludes that "in commercial relationships the
principles of gratuitousness and the logic of gift as an expres-
sion of gratuitousness can and must find their place within
normal economic activity" (36). Importantly for my argu-
ment, Benedict XVI also indicates regrets with the way
"some states, power groups and companies hoard resources"
and expresses concerns with "the development in poor coun-
tries" (49). Together with the topic models' quantitative
inference, these qualitative excerpts support the argument
that the Vatican's release of political statements follow deep-
ening political crises and the incapabilities of states to deal
with them.11
The theory is further validated through a more explicit
STM analysis, which permits to calculate statistical corre-
lations between topics (the outcome variable) and external
covariates at the document level of analysis. To run STM, I
generated the binary variable "crisis", which takes the
value of 1 if the year in which an encyclical is published is
one of crisis ( t = crisis) or if the year was recently pre-
ceded by a crisis (i.e. t -1 and t - 2 ).12 The STM algo-
rithm (Lucas et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2014) can proceed
only with a model of minimum 3 topics, so I specify k = 3
. This is basically the model specified to construct Figure 2
with the additional crisis covariate. Following Figure 2,
Topic 1 should represent the more political themes, while
Topics 2 and 3 are more concentrated on classical doctrine.
So, according to the theory, Topic 1 should be positively
correlated with the crisis covariate, because the occurrence
of an international crisis should lead to more political inter-
ventions by the Vatican.
I estimate the mean difference in topic proportions for
the two different values of the covariate (0 for no crisis and
1 for crisis). Figure 5 presents these results with 80% con-
fidence intervals. The point estimates with respect to Topic
1 are indeed positive and border the said level of statistical
significance. This is evidence that the words captured by
the topic are triggered by historical events, and particularly
by the crisis of international secular power. Topic 2 also
presents a positive coefficient, although the confidence
interval is less reliable. More interestingly, the point esti-
mate of Topic 3 is negative and statistically significant
(even at higher levels of statistical confidence). This indi-
cates that crises decreases the proportions of words cen-
tered on highly spiritual concepts. Thus, the effects shown
Figure 4. International crises cause more political encyclicals: selected events.
8 Research and Politics 
with this analysis indicate that the relative portions of top-
ics in the encyclicals are, to some extent, substitutes to each
other. This is in line with the theoretical expectation.
It is especially important to underline that the mecha-
nism outlined here seems to work regardless of the papacy
in charge at the time of the encyclical. Of course, religious
leaders give different importance to different issues and
take different positions on different social policies.
Nonetheless, the sensitivity of the Catholic church to inter-
national problems appears to translate into a consistent and
significant political message independently on personal-
ity-based explanations. In order to illustrate this point, I
explore the most recent 2015 encyclical called Laudato Si.
Many have depicted this document as a political break-
through, if not even a political manifesto.13 In addition to
its unprecedented focus on ecology and climate change, it
is also the first encyclical fully written by Pope Francis,
who is considered an exceptionally modern pope for rea-
sons related to his modest practices and his attachment to
the South of the world. Is his message really as different as
some have pointed out? Decomposing the document in
word frequencies helps answering this question.As already
highlighted in the historical topic models, the 2015
encyclical is focused on political issues, as human (uman-),
social (social), development (sviluppo) and politics (polit-)
appear in the list of the top 15 words. However, god (dio),
world (mondo) and creation (creato) appear as well and in
comparable amounts.
Along these lines, Figure 6 shows the loadings of the key
words that belong to the two estimated topic models. The
first topic clearly captures the same spiritual theme found in
the aggregated historical calculations. Consequently, the
encyclical is still dominated by a thorough discussion of
"universal destination" and connectivity between god and
men. At the same time, the second topic is explicitly con-
nected to my argument that the Vatican responds to the inac-
tion of political institutions, because the encyclical
recurrently points to the issues that have stalled international
debates such as the United Nations negotiations on climate
change. For example, highlighting the fact that international
leaders have failed at properly incorporating basic adapta-
tion strategies in the international climate regime, the encyc-
lical says, "there is an urgent need to develop policies so
that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide
and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced,
for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing
sources of renewable energy" (26). Similarly, the Laudato Si
takes a position on the failures of carbon credit allocation by
suggesting that "in no way does [emission trading] allow for
the radical change which present circumstances require"
(171). In sum, the encyclical clearly reacts to a series of
international coordination failures, such as the infamous
Copenhagen fiasco in 2009 and the saturated post-Kyoto
Protocol negotiations after 2012. At the same time, it is built
on increasingly frequent demands for political change such
as the 2014 Climate People's March, which has given
momentum to this global public issue. These observations
are consistent with the theoretical argument: following pop-
ular demands and reacting to the political void of incapable
states, the church has systematically filled a rhetorical space
for political action.

Conclusions
Political scientists are increasingly interested in the role of
religion in international politics, and the study of religious
attitudes and religious organizations is currently expand-
ing. However, little is known of how spiritual leaders use
political statements with respect to world politics. In this
article I argued that religious authorities have an interest in
making themselves heard on pressing global issues. I
hypothesized that religious authorities should be more
inclined to substitute rather than complement states' posi-
tions on global issues, especially when such secular posi-
tions are unclear, non-credible or non-effective.
I tested my claim by studying the post-world wars encyc-
licals of the Roman Catholic church. The results from latent
topic models indicate that the encyclicals differ between those
that are more prominently spiritual and those that are more
dominantly political. I find that the more political encyclicals
are principally issued following moments of political instabil-
ity and coordination failures. Thus, the evidence suggests that
the church decides to explicitly address politics when states
fail to do so. This holds across papacies and is also valid for
texts that may have generally been considered exceptional,
such as the 2015 climate change encyclical.
While the main lesson of this article is that the Vatican
consistently exposes the problematic aspects of worldly
disorders and inefficient governance through official docu-
ments, the author does not seek to argue that all Popes take
the same uniform political sides. In fact, the qualitative
investigation revealed some variation in the formulation of
positions. For example, Jean XXIII's Pacem in Terris and
Francis's Laudato Si seem to take more explicit stands
against certain directions of action on specific topics, i.e.
stopping nuclear deterrence or halting climate change with
market instruments, than encyclicals such as Paul VI's
Humanae Vitae, which is still critical but more generic.
These positions may vary across Popes, but my data is too
limited to test any claims on ideology. Future studies may
want to collect alternative data to evaluate the different
sides of right- and left-leaning Popes. Additional work may
also build on this contribution to test whether my argument
travels other spiritual denominations beyond the Catholic
church. Moreover, future research may expand on my anal-
ysis in order to explore how religious statements are con-
nected to the observed behaviour of spiritual leaders in the
international arena.

 9. Technically speaking, the LDA model is a three-level hierar-
chical Bayesian model that treats each document as contain-
ing a finite mixture of underlying topics (Blei et al., 2003).
10. For the LDA­human comparison, I drew a number of pairs
of encyclicals from the same cluster and from the opposite
clusters and asked a trained Italian speaker who had no spe-
cific knowledge of the encyclicals to read the introduction of
each document (roughly 30 pages of text). Then, I asked him
to rate the similarity of the documents within each pair with
0 (unrelated), 1 (loosely related), or 2 (closely related).
11. I also find that the content of the political encyclicals closely
matches the nature of the international crises they follow.
Additional excerpts in Table A.1 in the Appendix highlight
the passages in which the encyclicals show distress with the
specificities of each crisis.

Pacem In Terris
(1963)
109. We are deeply distressed to see the enormous stocks of armaments that
have been, and continue to be, manufactured in the economically more developed
countries. This policy is involving a vast outlay of intellectual and material
resources, with the result that the people of these countries are saddled with a
great burden, while other countries lack the help they need for their economic
and social development.
Cuban Missile
Crisis (1962)
 110. There is a common belief that under modern conditions peace cannot be
assured except on the basis of an equal balance of armaments and that this factor
is the probable cause of this stockpiling of armaments. Thus, if one country
increases its military strength, others are immediately roused by a competitive
spirit to augment their own supply of armaments. And if one country is equipped
with atomic weapons, others consider themselves justified in producing such
weapons themselves, equal in destructive force.

 112. Hence justice, right reason, and the recognition of man's dignity cry out
insistently for a cessation to the arms race. The stock-piles of armaments
which have been built up in various countries must be reduced all round and
simultaneously by the parties concerned. Nuclear weapons must be banned. A
general agreement must be reached on a suitable disarmament program,
with an effective system of mutual control.

Humanae Vitae (1968) Appeal to Public Authorities: And now We wish to speak to rulers of nations.
To you most of all is committed the responsibility of safeguarding the common
good. You can contribute so much to the preservation of morals. We beg of you,
never allow the morals of your peoples to be undermined. The family is the
primary unit in the state; do not tolerate any legislation which would introduce
into the family those practices which are opposed to the natural law of God.
For there are other ways by which a government can and should solve the
population problem ­that is to say by enacting laws which will assist families
and by educating the people wisely so that the moral law and the freedom of the
citizens are both safeguarded.
Sexual Revolution
(1968)
 Seeking True Solutions: We are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the
public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In
fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We
published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now We join Our
voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make
Our own his words [...]

 No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible
for what clearly seems to be the result of misguided governmental policies,
of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material
goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and
responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and
their children. (27) If only all governments which were able would do what
some are already doing so nobly, and bestir themselves to renew their efforts and
their undertakings! [...] Here We believe an almost limitless field lies open for the
activities of the great international institutions.

Laborem Exercens
(1981)
1. Man's life is built up every day from work, from work it derives its specific
dignity, but at the same time work contains the unceasing measure of human
toil and suffering, and also of the harm and injustice which penetrate deeply into
social life within individual nations and on the international level. While it is true
that man eats the bread produced by the work of his hands - and this means not
only the daily bread by which his body keeps alive but also the bread of science
and progress, civilization and culture - it is also a perennial truth that he eats this
bread by `the sweat of his face', that is to say, not only by personal effort and
toil but also in the midst of many tensions, conflicts and crises, which,
in relationship with the reality of work, disturb the life of individual
societies and also of all humanity.

Encyclical Excerpts Crisis
 We are celebrating the ninetieth anniversary of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum on
the eve of new developments in technological, economic and political conditions
which, according to many experts, will influence the world of work and
production no less than the industrial revolution of the last century.
There are many factors of a general nature: the widespread introduction of
automation into many spheres of production, the increase in the cost of
energy and raw materials, the growing realization that the heritage of nature
is limited and that it is being intolerably polluted, and the emergence on the
political scene of peoples who, after centuries of subjection, are demanding their
rightful place among the nations and in international decision-making. These new
conditions and demands will require a reordering and adjustment of
the structures of the modern economy.

Centesimus Annus
(1991)
23. Among the many factors involved in the fall of oppressive regimes,
some deserve special mention. Certainly, the decisive factor which gave rise
to the changes was the violation of the rights of workers. It cannot be forgotten
that the fundamental crisis of systems claiming to express the rule and indeed the
dictatorship of the working class began with the great upheavals which took
place in Poland in the name of solidarity. It was the throngs of working people
which foreswore the ideology which presumed to speak in their name. [...]
End of Cold War
and Collapse of
USSR (1989)
 24. The second factor in the crisis was certainly the inefficiency of the
economic system, which is not to be considered simply as a technical problem,
but rather a consequence of the violation of the human rights to private
initiative, to ownership of property and to freedom in the economic
sector. To this must be added the cultural and national dimension: it is not
possible to understand man on the basis of economics alone, nor to define him
simply on the basis of class membership. [...]

 47. Following the collapse of Communist totalitarianism and of many
other totalitarian and `national security' regimes, today we are witnessing
a predominance, not without signs of opposition, of the democratic ideal,
together with lively attention to and concern for human rights. But for this very
reason it is necessary for peoples in the process of reforming their systems
to give democracy an authentic and solid foundation through the explicit
recognition of those rights.

 Even in countries with democratic forms of government, these rights are not
always fully respected. Here we are referring not only to the scandal of abortion,
but also to different aspects of a crisis within democracies themselves, which
seem at times to have lost the ability to make decisions aimed at the common
good. Certain demands which arise within society are sometimes not examined
in accordance with criteria of justice and morality, but rather on the basis of
the electoral or financial power of the groups promoting them. With time, such
distortions of political conduct create distrust and apathy, with a subsequent
decline in the political participation and civic spirit of the general
population, which feels abused and disillusioned. As a result, there is a growing
inability to situate particular interests within the framework of a coherent vision
of the common good.

Evangelium Vitae
(1995)
4. The fact that legislation in many countries, perhaps even departing from basic
principles of their Constitutions, has determined not to punish these practices
against life, and even to make them altogether legal, is both a disturbing
symptom and a significant cause of grave moral decline. Choices once unanimously
considered criminal and rejected by the common moral sense are gradually
becoming socially acceptable. [...] In such a cultural and legislative situation,
the serious demographic, social and family problems which weigh upon many of
the world's peoples and which require responsible and effective attention from
national and international bodies, are left open to false and deceptive solutions,
opposed to the truth and the good of persons and nations.

 27. Among the signs of hope we should also count the spread, at many levels
of public opinion, of a new sensitivity ever more opposed to war as
an instrument for the resolution of conflicts between peoples, and
increasingly oriented to finding effective but "non-violent" means to
counter the armed aggressor. In the same perspective there is evidence of a
growing public opposition to the death penalty, even when such a penalty is seen
as a kind of "legitimate defence" on the part of society. Modern society in fact
has the means of effectively suppressing crime by rendering criminals harmless
without definitively denying them the chance to reform.

Caritas in Veritate
(2009)
24. In our own day, the State finds itself having to address the limitations to
its sovereignty imposed by the new context of international trade and
finance, which is characterized by increasing mobility both of financial capital and
means of production, material and immaterial. This new context has altered the
political power of States.
Financial Crisis
(2008)
 Today, as we take to heart the lessons of the current economic crisis, which sees
the State's public authorities directly involved in correcting errors and
malfunctions, it seems more realistic to re-evaluate their role and their powers,
which need to be prudently reviewed and remodelled so as to enable them,
perhaps through new forms of engagement, to address the challenges of today's
world. Once the role of public authorities has been more clearly defined, one
could foresee an increase in the new forms of political participation, nationally
and internationally, that have come about through the activity of organizations
operating in civil society; in this way it is to be hoped that the citizens' interest
and participation in the res publica will become more deeply rooted.
