Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and kidney disease are strong
independent risk factor for death and renal failure.1,2
Moreover, DM and kidney disease hasten vascular compli-
cations.3­6 The combination of diabetes and kidney disease
relates to a two- to four-fold increase in the risk of cardio-
vascular disease and death.7­11 The renin-angiotensin sys-
tem (RAS) plays a major role in cardiovascular and renal
dysfunction.12­15 Thus, RAS blockade by angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin-recep-
tor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to reduce all-cause
mortality in DM and kidney disease.16­18

Abstract
Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely
used to block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Yet it remains uncertain whether these drugs are equally effective
and safe.
Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of ACEis/ARBs in diabetes and kidney disease published in PubMed,
Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases were searched for clinical outcomes
including all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hyperkalemia and cough.
Results: Eight meta-analyses included 2177­61,264 patients with follow-up of 6­108 months. RAS blockers reduced
mortality (relative risk ratio (RR), 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86­0.95) without heterogeneity. The death
protection was significant specifically with ACEis (RR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79­0.91), but not with ARBs. Protection against
ESRD was homogenously evident by ARBs (RR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.73­0.87), ACEis (RR, 0.79, 95% , 0.64­0.94), and both
(RR, 0.79, 95% CI, 0.73­0.87). Significant side effects were hyperkalemia by ARBs (RR, 2.44, 95% CI, 1.13­5.26), and
cough by ACEis (RR, 2.38, 95% CI, 1.75­3.22)
Conclusions: In patients with diabetes and kidney disease, ACEis and ARBs are consistently protective for the
development of ESRD. Use of ACEis alone additionally reduces deaths and increases the risk for cough. Use of ARBs
alone increases the risk for hyperkalemia without additional benefit of death protection.

Original Article
2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
Recently, a meta-analysis has shown that ACEis and
ARBs may exert different effects on all-cause mortality in
DM patients.19 Yet, it remains uncertain whether ACEis
and ARBs have differential effects on all-cause mortality,
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and adverse reactions.
The objective of this updated study is to perform a meta-
analysis of meta-analyses to assess the comparative effects
of ACEis and ARBs on all-cause mortality, ESRD, and
adverse reactions in patients with DM and kidney disease.
Methods
Eligibility criteria
All studies that met the following criteria were included:
(a) systematic reviews and meta-analyses; (b) patients
with DM and kidney disease; (c) randomized controlled
clinical trials of ACEis and ARBs (any dose or type); and
(d) clinical outcomes including all-cause mortality, ESRD,
and adverse events such as hyperkalemia (defined as
plasma potassium in excess of 5.5 mmol /l), cough, and
headache; (e) relative risk ratios (RRs) were calculated
with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Exclusion criteria
Exclusion criteria included: (a) studies of patients with a
diagnosis of acute kidney injury, as defined by an abrupt
(within 48 h) reduction in renal function, manifested by an
increase in serum creatinine level (0.3 mg/dl or 26.5
µmol/l) with or without reduced urine output (<400 ml/day
); (b) duplicated articles; and (c) meta-analysis not meeting
the inclusion criteria. Eligibility assessment was per-
formed independently by two investigators (JS, YMH),
using pre-designed eligibility forms, with all questions
resolved by consensus with other authors.
Search strategy and databases
This updated systematic review and meta-analysis is
reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement. We selected relevant studies published between
1 January 1980­15 June 2015, by searching PubMed,
Medline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical
Database, and Wanfang databases. All potentially relevant
articles including reference lists of retrieved papers were
investigated as full text in English. For ambiguous or
missing information, we contacted the authors where pos-
sible. We used the following combined text and MeSH
terms: "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,"
"Angiotensin II receptor blockers," "Renin-angiotensin
system," "Meta analysis," "Diabetes mellitus," and
"Kidney disease". We also did a manual search, using the
reference lists of published articles. In the next step, the
title and then the abstract of papers were examined.
Duplicated articles were excluded, and then potentially
eligible studies were retrieved for perusal in full text. The
extracted data included first author name or study title,
year of publication date, country of origin, number char-
acteristics of participants, details of intervention, outcome
measures, intervention durations, adverse events, and rel-
ative risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding 95% confi-
dence interval (CI). All articles were read by two
independent reviewers (XNS, XZH), who archived data
from the articles according to a standardized data extrac-
tion form. Disagreements were resolved in all cases by
discussion among our team members.
Quality assessment
The methodological quality of systematic reviews and
meta-analyses was assessed by the Assessment of Multiple
Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) guidelines.20,21 This form
of assessment has good inter-rater reliability, validity, and
responsibility, and has been widely applied for measuring
the methodological quality of systematic reviews.22 Based
on the recommendations of the Canadian Agency for
Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), those with
score <4 were considered as low quality, 5­8 were consid-
ered as moderate, and 9­11 as high quality.23 Two inde-
pendent reviewers (JS, YMH) appraised the quality of the
included reviews using AMSTAR scores. Each article was
given an AMSTAR total score, based on the number of
AMSTAR criteria that were fulfilled.24,25 A third reviewer
(HLZ) served to resolve disputes.
Outcome measures
Outcomes were risks of all-cause mortality, ESRD, hyper-
kalemia (defined as plasma potassium in excess of 5.5
mmol/l), cough and headache.
Synthesis of data
Dichotomous outcome data from individual trials were
analyzed by using RR measure and corresponding 95% CI.
Data were pooled using the random-effects model when
the heterogeneity was significant and the fixed effect
model when the included studies showed homogeneity.
We assessed the p value of the Chi-square test to determine
heterogeneity and I2 to measure for inconsistency.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-square test, with
values greater than 50% regarded as being indicative of
moderate-to-high heterogeneity and were calculated by
using a random-effects meta-analysis model;26 otherwise,
we used the fixed-effects meta-analysis model.27 The pos-
sibility of publication bias was quantified using the Begg's
and Egger's test.28,29 A two-tailed p>0.05 was considered
Shen et al. 3
to show no bias. This was followed by confirmation with
performing a visual inspection of Begg funnel plots in
which RRs were plotted against their standard errors (SEs).
Results
Description of the included studies
The study selection process that resulted from our meta-anal-
ysis is shown in Supplementary Material, Figure 1.Atotal of
295 articles were initially identified. Eventually, eight meta-
analyses met our inclusion criteria, enrolling 2177­61,264
(median, 21,871) patients.30­37 All the eight meta-analyses
were published between 2005­2015 (Table 1). Two studies
were conducted in China, three in Australia, one in England,
one in New Zealand, and one in Thailand. Diabetes includ-
ing diabetic kidney disease was found in seven studies and
five studies concerned kidney disease including diabetic kid-
ney disease. Four studies compared ARBs with placebo, and
seven studies comparedACEis with control using other anti-
hypertensive agents. The age of the participants ranged from
18­80 years. The duration of studies ranged from six months
to nine years. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the meta-
analyses included in the analysis.
Risk of bias within studies
As shown in Supplementary Material, Table 1, the range in
the total AMSTAR score for the eight meta-analyses was
7­10 (theoretical range 0­11) and the mean (standard devia-
tion (SD)) was 8.5 (0.77). Study quality in general was
good: five of eight of studies had an AMSTAR score of 9,
and the other three had an AMSTAR score of 7­8. Based on
the recommendations of the CADTH, five studies were con-
sidered high quality, and three considered moderate quality.
Publication bias was quantified using the Begg's and
Egger's test, p>0.05 was considered to be no bias. The
p-values were 0.13 and 0.12 for all-cause mortality, 1 and
0.65 for ESRD, 1 and 0.79 for hyperkalemia, 0.73 and 0.45
for cough, and 0.30 and 0.28 for headache, indicating no
evidence for publication bias.
Primary outcomes
All-cause mortality.Seven studies reported all-cause mor-
tality (Supplementary Material, Table 2). Treatment with
ACEis/ARBs significantly reduced all-cause mortality
(RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86­0.95), with homogeneity and
consistency of the study results (I²=0.0%, p=0.618). There-
fore, the fixed-effects model was used for statistical analy-
sis (Supplementary Material, Figure 2(a)), the symmetric
funnel plot suggested no significant publication bias (Sup-
plementary Material, Figure 2(b)). Specifically, the level
of death protection was significant by ACEis (RR: 0.85,
95% CI: 0.79­0.91, p<0.0001), but not ARBs (RR: 0.98,
95% CI: 0.89­1.07, p=0.579) (Figure 1(a)). No significant
publication bias was found in the symmetric funnel plot
(Figure 1(b)).

End-stage renal disease.ESRD was the outcome in four
studies (Supplementary Material, Table 3). Use of ACEis/
ARBs reduced the risk of ESRD (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73­
0.87, p<0.0001) (Supplementary Material, Figure 3(a)) in
fixed-effects model analysis (I2=0.0%, p=0.814). The
symmetry of the funnel plot revealed little publication bias
(Supplementary Material, Figure 3(b)). As shown in Fig-
ure 2(a), the protection against ESRD was similar for
ACEis (RR: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.64­0.94) and ARBs (RR,
0.79, 95% CI, 0.73­0.87). The funnel plot demonstrated
publication bias unlikely (Figure 2(b)).
Hyperkalemia.The pooled data of four meta-analyses
(Supplementary Material, Table 4) showed an increased
risk of hyperkalemia with the use of ACEis/ARBs (RR,
1.76, 95% CI, 1.04­2.97) (Supplementary Material, Figure
4(a)). The symmetric funnel plot suggested no publication
bias (Supplementary Material, Figure 4(b)). In fixed-
effects model analysis shown in Figure 3(a), the increased
risk of hyperkalemia was attributed to ARBs (RR, 2.44,
95% CI, 1.13­5.26), but not ACEis (RR, 1.33, 95% CI,
0.65­2.71). Consistently, little publication bias was evi-
dent by the symmetric funnel plot (Figure 3(b)).
Cough. The synthesized data of four studies (Supplemen-
tary Material, Table 5) suggested an increased risk of
cough by the treatment with ACEis/ARBs (RR, 2.27, 95%
CI, 1.64-3.15) (Supplementary Material, Figure 5(a)).
Concerning the significant heterogeneity between the four
studies (I²=68.5%, p=0.023), we used the random-effects
model for statistical analysis. Publication bias was not sig-
nificant in the funnel plot (Supplementary Material, Figure
5(b)). In the random-effects model analysis shown in Fig-
ure 4(a), the increased risk of cough was attributed to the
use of ACEis (RR, 2.38, 95% CI, 1.75­3.22) rather than
ARBs (RR, 1.47, 95% CI, 0.72­3.03). The symmetric fun-
nel plot suggested no significant publication bias (Figure
4(b)).
Headache. The pooled data of three studies (Supplemen-
tary Material, Table 6) revealed that the risk of headache
was not increased by the treatment withACEis/ARBs (RR,
0.81, 95% CI, 0.61­1.08) (Figure 5(a)) in the fixed-effects
model analysis (I2=0.0%). Consistently, the symmetric
funnel plot suggested no significant publication bias (Fig-
ure 5(b)).
Discussion
In this updated meta-analysis of meta-analyses with mod-
erate to high methodological quality, ACEis and ARBs are
consistently protective for the development of ESRD in
patients with diabetes and kidney disease, Use of ACEis
alone additionally reduces the risk of death and increases

the risk for cough. In contrast, use ofARBs alone increases
the risk for hyperkalemia without additional benefit of
death protection.
Patients with diabetes38,39 or kidney disease40­42 are at
increased risk of death and renal failure. Prevalent in
patients with diabetes or kidney disease is comorbidity
with hypertension. ACEis and ARBs have been recom-
mended for clinical treatment.43,44 Previous studies have
demonstrated that ACEis and ARBs protect against the
progression to renal failure in patients with kidney dis-
ease.44­46 In this updated meta-analysis, both ACEis and
ARBs are protective for the development of ESRD in peo-
ple with diabetes and kidney disease. Furthermore, ACEis
are generally superior to ARBs in minimizing the risks of
all-cause mortality and hyperkalemia. A major concern for
the use of ACEis relate to the occurrence of cough. A pos-
sible rationale for the additional benefit of ACEis in con-
trast to ARBs on death protection may relate to
angiotensin-(1-7).47,48 Moreover, ACEis also increase
bradykinin levels to stimulate glucose metabolism49 and
trigger cough. In cases where the cough is intolerable,
ARBs fit patients at risk of renal failure.
There are several potential limitations of this study.
First, our results are subject to limitations inherent to any
meta-analysis based on pooling data from different meta-
analyses. Meta-analyses of ACEis and ARBs were not
equivalent. Second, there is the possibility of overlap trials
between the included meta-analyses. Third, substantial
differences exist in the doses of the used drugs, duration of
intervention, period of follow-up, and study population. It

is hard to ensure quality control. Fourth, patients included
in the reported meta-analyses have uneven baseline data,
other concomitant conditions, and background therapies.
These potential factors might have impacts on the interpre-
tation of our findings.
