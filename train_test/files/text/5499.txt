Introduction
Weight loss is commonly recommended to over-
weight and obese adults, especially those with type
2 diabetes, in order to reduce cardiovascular risk;
however, the effect of weight loss on cardiovascular
disease (CVD) outcomes has never been tested
definitively [1]. The results of epidemiologic studies
have been inconsistent, and randomized controlled

The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study is a long-term clinical trial
that aims to determine the cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of an intensive life-
style intervention (ILI) in obese adults with type 2 diabetes. The study was designed
to have 90% statistical power to detect an 18% reduction in the CVD event rate in
the ILI Group compared to the Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) Group over
10.5 years of follow-up.
The original power calculations were based on an expected CVD rate of 3.125% per
year in the DSE group; however, a much lower-than-expected rate in the first 2 years
of follow-up prompted the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to recommend
that the Steering Committee undertake a formal blinded evaluation of these design
considerations. The Steering Committee created an Endpoint Working Group (EPWG)
that consisted of individuals masked to study data to examine relevant issues.
The EPWG considered two primary options: (1) expanding the definition of the
primary endpoint and (2) extending follow-up of participants. Ultimately, the EPWG
recommended that the Look AHEAD Steering Committee approve both strategies.
The DSMB accepted these modifications, rather than recommending that the trial
continue with inadequate statistical power.
Trialists sometimes need to modify endpoints after launch. This decision should be
well justified and should be made by individuals who are fully masked to interim
results that could introduce bias. This article describes this process in the Look
AHEAD study and places it in the context of recent articles on endpoint modifica-
tion and recent trials that reported endpoint modification. Clinical Trials 2012; 9:

DESIGN

trials of weight loss have generally focused on
short-term changes in intermediate endpoints like
blood pressure and serum lipids [2,3]. The Look
AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study [4]
(Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00017953) was
designed to be the definitive test of the long-term
health benefits of a lifestyle intervention aimed at
weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.
The primary hypothesis was that the lifestyle inter-
vention would reduce the incidence of a composite
endpoint of incident CVD defined as cardiovascular
death (including fatal myocardial infarction and
stroke), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal
stroke. The secondary hypothesis was that the lifestyle
intervention would reduce the incidence of a com-
posite endpoint of all-cause death or incident CVD-
related secondary outcomes defined in aggregate as
myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary (PC)
intervention, hospitalization for congestive heart
failure (CHF), carotid endarterectomy, or surgical
bypass or percutaneous intervention for peripheral
arterial disease.
The sample size was based on the aim of detecting
an 18% difference in the primary endpoint in the
intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared to the
Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) control group.
(During the design of the trial, targets of 15%­20%
for interventions were identified as conveying sig-
nificant public health benefit. The Steering
Committee selected an 18% intervention effect on
which to base power projections because this
appeared feasible and required a cohort sufficiently
large to meet other objectives of the trial.) We made
the following assumptions: (1) The rate of incident
CVD in the DSE group would be 3.125% per year
(corresponding to the projected rate of incident CVD
in a population of overweight and obese adults with
type 2 diabetes eligible for participation in Look
AHEAD); (2) the cohort would be recruited uniformly
over 2.5 years of follow-up; (3) in all, 2% of partici-
pants would be lost to endpoint ascertainment annu-
ally; and (4) participants lost to follow-up would be
similar to their counterparts in regard to both treat-
ment and endpoint risk. Based on these assumptions,
we determined that 5000 participants followed up
for a maximum of 11.5 years would yield 92% power
(with two-sided  = 0.05) to detect an 18% relative
difference in the composite primary endpoint (i.e.,
an absolute event rate of 3.125 per 100 person-years
in the DSE group versus an absolute event rate of
2.562 per 100 person-years in the ILI group).
The 3.125% event rate was a best estimate based
on reported CVD event rates among individuals
similar to those who were to be recruited for the
study. Specifically, we used longitudinal data
from diabetic participants in the Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [5] and the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [6]. We assumed
that 75% of Look AHEAD participants would have
no history of CVD and that their age distribution
would represent an equal mixture of the ARIC (45­
64 at baseline) and CHS (65­75 at baseline) samples.
The overall event rate for the combined ARIC + CHS
diabetic population was estimated to be 3.72%. This
event rate was adjusted 5% upward to account for
silent myocardial infarctions (which were not part
of the ARIC/CHS event estimates) and then 20%
downward to account for both a healthy volunteer
effect and the overall decline in CVD event rates in
the United States since the 1980s. This produced the
anticipated 3.125% event rate used for power calcu-
lations (3.72% × 1.05 × 0.80 = 3.125%).
Lower-than-expected event rates
As Look AHEAD reached the 2-year mark, the Data
and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), charged with
monitoring study progress, noted that the actual
event rate in the DSE group was much lower than
expected and informed the Steering Committee
through the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive
and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Project Office. The
Steering Committee therefore reconsidered the
power projections in light of this lower-than-
expected event rate. For example, at a hypothetical
2% event rate in the DSE group over 11.5 years of
follow-up (considerably lower than the anticipated
3.125% rate), the trial would have 80% power to
detect an 18% effect on the primary endpoint ­ less
than the originally planned 90% power but still
acceptable. However, as Look AHEAD reached the
3-year mark, the DSMB observed that the event rate
in the DSE group was only 0.7% per year. In response
to continuing DSMB concern, the Steering
Committee created an Endpoint Working Group
(EPWG) to carefully consider the ramifications of
the lower-than-expected event rate and to recom-
mend alternative approaches to preserve the study's
integrity and maximize its scientific value.
EPWG
The EPWG included five Look AHEAD clinical
investigators well versed in clinical trials, three
National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists, and
two clinical trials experts not affiliated with Look
AHEAD (Table 1). Two members also served on the
study's Adjudication Committee, responsible for
ascertaining endpoints. All EPWG members were
masked to study results, including the three NIH sci-
entific officers (Evans, Kaufman, and Geller). The
EPWG was charged with evaluating all relevant aspects
of the study bearing on the lower-than-expected
Midcourse correction when the event rate is underestimated 115
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 113­124
event rate, including the duration of follow-up and
definition of the primary endpoint. To avoid bias
and to maximize masking of the study investiga-
tors, the EPWG only examined outcome data from
the DSE control group and shared only summary
data when making its recommendations to the
Steering Committee. Neither the EPWG nor the
Steering Committee was ever privy to the overall
event rate (DSE and ILI combined), so data on the
event rate in the DSE group did not effectively
unblind them. The EPWG convened regularly to
deliberate and to review updated event rates. A
timeline of events and key study dates are provided
in Figure 1.
Why Look AHEAD event rates
were lower than expected
The EPWG identified three possible reasons for the
unexpectedly low CVD event rates:
1. Secular trends have resulted in lower CVD inci-
dence and CVD mortality in the United States:
The downward trend in CVD appears to result
from (a) improved control of dyslipidemia and
high blood pressure, which have reduced the
risk of clinically significant atherosclerosis and
(b) improved care of chronic and acute coro-
nary syndromes that have reduced CVD mortal-
ity [7,8].
2. Study participants were even healthier than
expected: During trial design, the Coordinating
Center and Steering Committee relied heavily
on data from cohort studies like ARIC [5] and
CHS [6]. The pattern of enrollment in cohort
studies, however, is markedly different from tri-
als: cohort studies like these enroll 50% or more
of eligible individuals in the community,
whereas trials forego representativeness in favor
of motivation to participate fully in study
interventions.
3. The Graded Exercise Test (GXT) excluded par-
ticipants most likely to develop CVD events: The
study included a GXT as an inclusion criterion
based on concerns about safety and liability
related to initiating an exercise program in
adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for CVD.
The GXT effectively excluded some higher-risk
participants (e.g., those with prevalent sympto-
matic CVD) who demonstrated electrocardio-
graphic or blood pressure abnormalities during
the test. The prospect of a GXT may have also
discouraged some individuals with exercise-
induced symptoms from attempting to enroll in
the trial.
The Steering Committee weighed all three of these
hypothetical concerns during the design phase and
deflated the projected event rate by 20%. In retro-
spect, however, the original event rate projections
were simply not conservative enough.
Options considered by the EPWG
1. Watchful waiting: Because of the healthy vol-
unteer effect, incident CVD events may be
delayed, yielding low event rates early in the
study. To determine whether the lower-than-
expected event rates were accurate and firm,
the EPWG recommended watchful waiting
beginning April 2004. After 3 years of watchful
waiting, the event rate remained low. To be
certain that the persistently low event rate was
not related to delays in endpoint ascertain-
ment and reporting, the EPWG recommended
a `Data Sweep' in late 2007. The Data Sweep
confirmed that the cumulative event rate in
the DSE group had remained nearly linear
since 2003.
2. Extend study duration: Absent a substantial
increase in event rates, extending the duration of

the study would result in increased events and
potentially boost power. However, with a stable
event rate that was about one-third of the pro-
jected rate and trending linear, a two- to three-
fold extension of the study's duration would be
required to obtain the required number of events.
A more feasible and acceptable extension (e.g.,
1­2 years) would provide too few events to
achieve the required power.
3. Broaden definition of the primary endpoint:
The third option considered by the EPWG was
to broaden the definition of the primary end-
point. Such consideration was not taken lightly,
since adherence to primary endpoints as speci-
fied in the original protocol is generally consid-
ered to be a cornerstone of clinical trial
methodology. However, the EPWG considered
the following:
a. During the design phase, the Steering Commit-
tee had debated the use of a broader endpoint
definition, since obesity was thought to have

adverse health effects well beyond CVD (e.g.,
certain cancers) but settled on traditional CVD
endpoints primarily for comparability with
other studies. After Look AHEAD was initiated,
the evidence for other adverse health effects of
obesity had grown [9,10].
b. After Look AHEAD was initiated, there was a
shift in the consensus among CVD trialists re-
garding standard study endpoints, prompted by
advances in diagnostic testing and downward
secular trends in myocardial infarction and
CVD death [11].
c. An influential paper provided a roadmap for
modifying endpoints midstream in a long-term
clinical trial when made by trialists blinded to
treatment effect [12]. The framework addressed
the possibility of extending duration and/or re-
defining study endpoints.
d. All things considered, the DSMB deemed it
scientifically more informative to evaluate the
effect of the Look AHEAD intervention on a
broader endpoint rather than to terminate the
trial for futility, especially since the interven-
tion had produced and sustained a substantial
contrast between study groups in body weight
and physical activity.
Additional endpoints considered
by EPWG to expand the original
composite endpoint
As the EPWG considered expanding the primary
composite endpoint to include additional end-
points, it posed the following five questions: (1)
Does obesity consistently predict the occurrence of
the endpoint in longitudinal epidemiologic studies?
(2) Is the endpoint of sufficient clinical importance
to serve in a composite endpoint alongside myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, and CVD death? (3) Is the
endpoint related to atherosclerotic CVD? As origi-
nally written, the protocol enshrined atheroscle-
rotic CVD as the study's main focus. Insofar as `new'
primary endpoints fall under this general category,
they fit more naturally with the original conceptual
framework. (4) How susceptible is the endpoint to
ascertainment bias? It is crucial to avoid including
in the primary endpoint any event that might be
susceptible to ascertainment bias; for example,
chronic stable angina might be differentially
detected in the Lifestyle Intervention Group,
because of more frequent exercise (which might
induce symptoms) and more frequent contact with
study staff (which might trigger safety measures
leading to medical evaluation and treatment). (5)
How acceptable is the endpoint to the study's
stakeholders and scientific and clinical audience?
Midstream changes in primary endpoints are apt to
be viewed with some suspicion by Look AHEAD's
stakeholders and audience: the less traditional or
familiar the endpoint, the more suspicious they
might be.
Criteria for an `ideal' additional
endpoint
The ideal additional endpoint(s) would therefore fit
the following five criteria: (a) related to obesity, (b)
high clinical importance, (c) related to atheroscle-
rotic CVD, (d) low risk of ascertainment bias, and
(e) acceptable to stakeholders and audience. With
these criteria in mind, the EPWG reviewed the fol-
lowing nine endpoints:
1. All-Cause Mortality ­ Already a secondary end-
point. Since cardiovascular mortality was
already a primary endpoint, moving `all-cause'
up from secondary to primary would amount to
adding non-CVD deaths (e.g., cancer death and
accidental death).
2. Hospitalized Angina ­ Angina of sufficient con-
cern to warrant hospitalization (see Figure 2).
3. Urgent Revascularization ­ Angina of sufficient
concern to warrant revascularization during the
hospitalization (i.e., surgery and angioplasty).
4. Hospitalized CHF.
5. Incident Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) ­
Based on serum creatinine at annual follow-
up visits.
6. Incident Obesity-Related Cancer ­ Defined as
cancer of the prostate, corpus uteri or endo-
metrium, cervix, ovary, colon/rectum, biliary
tract, esophagus, liver, pancreas, kidney, and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, all of which
appear to occur more frequently in obese
adults.
7. Incident Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) ­
Based on study electrocardiograms (ECGs).
8. Deep Venous Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism ­
As abstracted from hospital records.
9. Fractures ­ Hip, upper leg, pelvis, knee, lower
leg, ankle, foot (but not toe), coccyx, spine,
lower arm, wrist, hand (not finger), elbow,
upper arm, or shoulder.
The EPWG members selected these nine endpoints
based on their experience in other trials of diabetes
treatment and CVD prevention and on their knowl-
edge of the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and
obesity.

Deliberations regarding possible
additional endpoints
The EPWG evaluated each of these possible addi-
tional primary endpoints in detail. These delibera-
tions are summarized in Table 2, with particular
attention to how each endpoint might meet the five
criteria listed above.
This deliberation led the EPWG to narrow the
range of potentially acceptable endpoints to four:
all-cause mortality, hospitalized angina, urgent
revascularization, and hospitalized CHF. The ration-
ale for excluding other endpoints was as follows: (1)
Incident CKD, as defined by using serum creatinine
to estimate glomerular filtration rate, was consid-
ered to have insufficient clinical importance; (2)
cancer was too incongruent with our original end-
points and the evidence to determine which cancers
are `obesity related' was still unsettled; (3) LVH is
primarily asymptomatic and suffers from disagree-
ment about definition; (4) deep venous thrombosis/
pulmonary embolism has a wide range of gravitas,
is less related to atherosclerosis than are other
vascular endpoints, and has not been widely used in
trials or epidemiologic studies as part of a composite
vascular endpoint; and (5) fractures have a wide
range of severity and are inversely associated with
body mass index.
Thus, the EPWG carefully considered the four
remaining endpoints: all-cause mortality, hospital-
ized angina, urgent revascularization, and hospital-
ized CHF. These were reduced to three when the
EPWG determined that virtually all of the urgent
revascularizations in Look AHEAD occurred in par-
ticipants who otherwise met criteria for hospitalized
angina. The deliberations regarding all-cause mor-
tality, hospitalized angina, and hospitalized CHF
are summarized below.
All-Cause Mortality ­ The argument in favor was that
all-cause mortality is the bottom line for patients
and physicians and would provide a way to capture
effects on important non-CVD events, like cancer
or liver disease. The argument against was that (1)
these non-CVD events are best treated as secondary
endpoints, since the primary hypothesis focuses on
Figure 2. Look AHEAD adjudication criteria for hospitalized angina.
AHEAD: Action for Health in Diabetes.
Midcourse correction when the event rate is underestimated 119
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2012; 9: 113­124
CVD per se, and (2) all-cause mortality may intro-
duce `noise' in the form of accidental deaths and
nonobesity-related cancers (e.g., brain and lung).
Hospitalized Angina ­ The argument in favor was that
hospitalized angina would capture the `aborted' myo-
cardial infarctions related to secular improvements
in acute cardiac care; would be consistent in tone,
therefore, with recent thinking on CVD endpoints
(see Luepker et al. [11]); and is fully congruent with
the original hypothesis. The argument against was
that (1) it might be difficult to distinguish `urgent'
cases from `chronic' cases, the latter of which would
be susceptible to ascertainment bias in an unblinded

study, and (2) it might be difficult to agree upon
a specific definition. However, the current Look
AHEAD definition of hospitalized angina (see Figure
2) mitigated both concerns: the definition clearly
excluded chronic stable angina and the definition
had already been smoothly implemented by the
Adjudication Committee for several years without
generating significant disagreements among com-
mittee members.
Hospitalized CHF ­ The argument in favor was that
CHF is common and important, it was already a
component of the composite secondary endpoint,
and it might be improved by weight loss along a
variety of physiologic pathways (e.g., better exer-
cise tolerance, reduced reliance on thiazolidinedio-
nes, and improved lung function). The argument
against was that (1) CHF is a heterogenous syn-
drome related not only to atherosclerosis but also to
hypertension, renal disease, and other causes (e.g.,
valvular heart disease) generally not discernable
from the records available to the study adjudicators,
and (2) it is often difficult to distinguish from other
causes of acute dyspnea, especially chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease and pneumonia.
After deliberation, the EPWG unanimously favored
hospitalized angina and unanimously rejected hos-
pitalized CHF. A large majority was against all-cause
mortality, but a minority favored it. Further discus-
sion led to a consensus that the additional primary
endpoint plus all-cause mortality should be an addi-
tional major secondary analysis in the main results
of this study.
Event rates if primary endpoint
definition were expanded
Having evaluated the possible options for expand-
ing the primary endpoint on purely scientific
grounds, the EPWG then turned to the practical
matter of whether the potential additional end-
point occur frequently enough to augment the
overall event rate. The coordinating center deter-
mined that adding hospitalized angina to the pri-
mary endpoint definition would approximately
double the event rate in the DSE (control) group to
1.25%­1.35% per year.
Final EPWG recommendation for
response to lower-than-expected
event rate
After over 2 years of monitoring, research, and
deliberation, the EPWG made the following recom-
mendations to the Look AHEAD Steering Committee
as a means to address the lower-than-expected event
rate:
1. Expand the primary endpoint to include hospi-
talized angina
2. Extend the duration of the study by 24 months
3. Specify two additional secondary endpoints
a. Original primary composite endpoint
b.
Expanded primary composite endpoint
plus all-cause mortality
Net effect of these
recommendations on statistical
power
Either (a) expanding the primary endpoint to
include hospitalized angina without extending
study duration or (b) extending study duration by 2
years without expanding the primary endpoint
would increase statistical power to detect an effect
of 18% from roughly 50% to only 70%. Adopting
both recommendations would push statistical
power to roughly 75%, assuming no change in the
event rate in the second half of the study. If the
underlying event rate increased in the second half
of the study, then adoption of both recommenda-
tions would increase power to above 80% ­ that is,
into the conventional range for randomized con-
trolled trials. EPWG members recommended apply-
ing the same effect size (18% difference in risk of
the composite primary endpoint) to the expanded
endpoint, because the causal pathways to hospital-
ized angina were so similar to the pathways leading
to myocardial infarction and CVD death. The
change in the definition required an adjustment in
the formal statistical monitoring of the trial to pre-
serve the prior level of  spending while transition-
ing to rules based on the expanded endpoint.
Acceptability of recommendations
to the scientific audience outside
Look AHEAD
Even with the strongest scientific rationale, the
EPWG considered how these recommendations
might be viewed by the scientific audience outside
Look AHEAD. In the end, the EPWG consensus was
that the recommended modifications to the study
protocol would be well accepted for the following
four reasons: (1) they are responsive to generally
recognized secular trends in CVD, (2) they are
concordant with the study's original conceptual
framework and primary hypothesis, (3) they were
developed and proposed by a group that was aware
only of event rates in the comparison group and

otherwise fully blinded to treatment effects, and (4)
they were proposed 4 years the original before the
originally planned date of study close-out (December
2012).
Final decision by the Look AHEAD Steering
Committee
The EPWG presented its recommendations to the
Steering Committee on 8 April 2008. The Steering
Committee unanimously supported the recommen-
dation. Throughout the decision-making process,
the DSMB chose to remain silent on the specifics of
the protocol change, because it believed that its
unblinded status could otherwise introduce bias.
Beyond asking the Steering Committee to review the
low event rate in the DSE group, the DSMB never
indicated (a) whether it would have ended the trial
for futility had the protocol not been changed or (b)
whether the specific changes allayed its original con-
cern. Although neither the EPWG nor the Steering
Committee were privy to DSMB deliberations, both
groups recognized that the DSMB was in the awk-
ward position of having prompted an inquiry into
event rates and endpoint definition without having
the latitude to comment on the investigators find-
ings or response. From the perspective of the EPWG
and the Steering Committee, the investigators had
responded to the DSMB and saw only that the DSMB
continued to allow the trial to continue.
Review of prior literature
Modifying endpoints after launch
Rigorous adherence to study protocol is an acknowl-
edged cornerstone of trial methodology. In practice,
however, it appears that many trialists modify their
approach after the study goes into the field. In fact,
Chan [13,14] and Mathieu [15] estimate that about
one-third of properly registered trials undergo a
modification of the primary outcome(s) following
registration. That such changes often appear to
favor the intervention [15] heightens the fear that
failure to adhere to predetermined endpoints can
inflate type I error rate.
Nonetheless, trialists do recognize that there may
be appropriate reasons for modifying endpoints
after launch. For example, in 2002, Wittes [12]
argued for some `agility' in study design, especially
for long-term trials that may see secular trends in
standard of care or relevant endpoints, or that may
simply have been underpowered based on a priori
calculations. Indeed, over the past decade, several
large trials have changed endpoints after launch.
Table 3 summarizes changes made in six major trials
over the past 7 years. Most have done so apparently
without sacrificing integrity, impact, or acceptabil-
ity. The one possible exception is the PROActive
trial [16], which drew criticism for relying heavily
on a secondary endpoint that was introduced only a
few weeks before the trial was closed [17,18]. In two
of these trials (FIELD [19] and PEACE [20]), the defi-
nition of the primary endpoint was expanded to
increase the event rate in the face of unexpectedly
low power ­ similar to the situation in Look AHEAD.
In two trials, the primary endpoint was narrowed in
light of new data that came to light after launch
(NAVIGATOR [21,22] and EUROPA [23]).
Wittes [12] and Evans [24] agree that individuals
who are blinded to trial results should be the ones
who decide about changing the primary endpoint;
unblinded individuals might be tempted to modify
endpoints so as to favor positive results. Evans [24]
poses a series of questions to trialists who are con-
sidering a change: (1) What data triggered the
review? (2) Have interim results been reviewed? (3)
Who is making the decision? Ideally, endpoint
reviews would be triggered by factors other than
low event rates (e.g., secular trends in endpoint clas-
sification) and there would be no review of interim
results. In Look AHEAD, internal data (lower-than-
expected event rates) triggered the review and the
DSMB and unblinded Coordinating Center investi-
gators had reviewed interim results. However, the
decision makers were investigators in the EPWG
and Steering Committee and NIH project scientists,
all of whom were fully blinded. From Evans' per-
spective, therefore, these answers seem to put Look
AHEAD in a `gray zone' with regard to propriety ­
hence we prepared this article to make our decision-
making process fully transparent [24].
Modifying study duration after launch
In studies of CVD, extending the duration of follow-
up is a logical remedy for decreased power related to
lower-than-expected event rates. Because CVD is the
leading cause of death in the general population,
longer follow-up will inevitably lead to more events,
especially in middle-aged and older populations
with underlying CVD risk factors, like type 2 diabe-
tes and obesity. Less has been written about decision
making leading to a change in study duration.
Longer duration poses a special challenge in tri-
als designed to test a behavioral intervention for
two reasons: (1) It may be difficult to maintain the
contrast between the intervention group and the
comparison group in later years; (2) as the cohort
ages, the accumulating comorbid conditions might
interfere with adherence. The decision to increase
Look AHEAD's duration by 2 years required recon-
senting participants for extended duration, but the
intervention was otherwise unmodified.

Recent trends in cardiovascular endpoint
definitions
In the later part of the twentieth century, CVD
researchers began to observe secular trends in the
incidence, treatment, and natural history of coro-
nary heart disease that had important ramifications
for endpoint definition [25]. To create a new stand-
ard for CVD endpoints across studies, an interna-
tional panel of experts representing the American
Heart Association, the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the Centers for Disease
Control, the World Heart Federation, and the
European Society of Cardiology released a scientific
statement on `Case Definitions for Acute Coronary
Heart Disease in Epidemiology and Clinical Research
Studies' [11]. The statement identifies a standard
approach in using `unstable angina pectoris' as part
of a component definition of coronary heart disease
along with nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).
According to this scheme, `unstable angina' is
defined as new or changing cardiac symptoms with
positive ECG findings. The additional Look AHEAD
primary endpoint of `hospitalized angina' (see
Figure 2) is designed to capture episodes of unstable
angina as part of a composite definition of CVD.
Indeed, over the past decade, most major cardiovas-
cular trials have used composite endpoints, typi-
cally with three or four components [26]. This is
certainly true for trials of diabetes treatment [27].
Lessons learned
The experience regarding endpoint modification in
Look AHEAD teaches several lessons for long-term
trials.
First, in a long-term trial, it would be prudent to
prespecify plans for checking event rates during the
course of the trial. The plans should include options
that could be triggered if the observed rate is much
lower than expected. The options might include (a)
extending duration, (b) expanding the endpoint, or
(c) stopping the trial for lack of statistical power. In
Look AHEAD, the Coordinating Center conducted
regular rate checks under the supervision of the
DSMB, but there was no prespecified plan to react
when the rates were low.
Second, even absent low event rates, it might be
useful to prespecify a point at which the endpoint
definition is reexamined in light of secular trends
and prevailing practice.
Third, it might be helpful to use the number of
events to drive duration, rather than setting dura-
tion a priori based on estimated event rates. Of
course, this approach requires that the funding
source makes a somewhat open-ended commitment
in terms of duration, which may not be feasible in
some circumstances.
Finally, it is good to be as conservative as feasible
about projected event rates.
