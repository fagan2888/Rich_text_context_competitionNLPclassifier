Abstract: It is common scientific knowledge, that most of what we say within a
conversation is not only expressed by the words' meaning alone, but also through our
gestures, postures, and body movements. This non-verbal mode is possibly rooted firmly in
our human evolutionary heritage, and as such, some scientists argue that it serves as a
fundamental assessment and expression tool for our inner qualities. Studies of nonverbal
communication have established that a universal, culture-free, non-verbal sign system
exists, that is available to all individuals for negotiating social encounters. Thus, it is not
only the kind of gestures and expressions humans use in social communication, but also the
way these movements are performed, as this seems to convey key information about an
individual's quality. Dance, for example, is a special form of movement, which can be
observed in human courtship displays. Recent research suggests that people are sensitive to
the variation in dance movements, and that dance performance provides information about
an individual's mate quality in terms of health and strength. This article reviews the role of
body movement in human non-verbal communication, and highlights its significance in
human mate preferences in order to promote future work in this research area within the
evolutionary psychology framework.

Introduction
In animal and human communication, visual, tactile, acoustic and verbal signals are
transmitted from a sender to a receiver ("Lorenz-Tinbergen approach"; see Friedenberg and
Silverman, 2006). Shanker and King (2002) described communication as a dynamic rather
than a static process. This means that a signal is decoded by a receiver, who adds
information to the signal, and then decodes its meaning. One particular process in

communication is to send and receive wordless messages. This kind of information
transmission is commonly referred to as "nonverbal communication" (NVC). Nonverbal
signals include facial expressions, bodily orientation, movements, posture, vocal cues (other
than words), eye gaze, physical appearance, interpersonal spacing, and touching (Bull,
2001; DePaulo, 1992). As such, they support and moderate speech, facilitate the expression
of emotions, help communicating people's attitudes, convey information about personality,
and thus negotiate interpersonal relationships, even in the form of rituals (Bull, 2001;
Graham and Argyle, 1975).
In humans, many signals, such as facial expressions of emotion, are thought to be
cultural universals (Ekman and Friesen, 1971; Ekman et al., 1987), although a closer look
reveals that there is still variability in these signals (Grammer et al., 1988). Because
nonverbal behavior conveys emotions, these cues are sometimes referred to as "nonverbal
expressive behaviors" that can be used in self-presentation (DePaulo, 1992). NVC can also
comprise a set of so called "honest" signals since it is rather difficult for an individual to
suppress them, and make them more readily accessible to others (DePaulo, 1992). Thus,
there seems to be some kernel of truth in the proverb that "actions speak louder than words"
(Argyle, Salter, Nicholson, Williams, and Burgess, 1970; Argyle, Alkema and Gilmour,
1972; Bull, 2001). Most of the studies on human NVC research have investigated certain
types of body movements such as gestures (Bull and Connelly, 1985; Goldin-Meadow,
1999; Graham and Argyle, 1975; Krauss, 1998), facial expressions (Ekman, 1972, 1993;
Mehrabian and Ferris, 1967), gaze (Kleinke, 1986), and body posture (Bull, 1987), in order
to better understand the complexity of human social encounters.
Some support on the significance of NVC in social life comes from studies that have
investigated non-verbal cues in human courtship situations. In these studies, first encounters
of opposite-sex strangers were covertly filmed in "unstaged interaction" to investigate
flirting behavior (deWeerth and Kalma, 1995; Givens, 1978; Grammer, 1990; Grammer,
Juette, Schmitt, and Honda, 1999; Grammer, Kruck, Juette, and Fink, 2000; Moore, 1985;
Moore and Butler, 1989; Mühlenhard et al., 1986; Scheflen, 1965). When opposite sex
strangers meet for the first time, they both face the risk of being deceived. Neither opponent
is aware of the other's intention, thus both have to rely heavily on non-verbal cues.
Grammer (1990) reported that, in such a situation, there is a remarkable consistency in the
repertoire of female solicitation behaviors in the presence of a male stranger, including eye-
contact, followed by looking away, special postures, ways of walking, and so on (see also
Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1971; Grammer, 1989; Moore and Butler, 1989). Interestingly, men were
found to approach women who expressed high rates of signaling these behaviors more
frequently. In later study, Grammer et al. (1999) found that some information about female
interest is not only inherent in the number of certain non-verbal signals, but is also encoded
in the quality of body movements, such as their amplitude and speed. For example, women
moved more frequently, but also displayed smaller and slower movements when they were
interested in a man. Men in turn reacted to the quality of these movements positively and
judged the situation to be more pleasant.
Based on these findings, researchers have begun to emphasize that it is not only the
type of gesture or posture that are important in courtship situations, but rather the ways in
which such displays are carried out. More recent findings further support this by showing

that the attractiveness perception of human dance correlates with aspects of an individual's
mate quality (Brown et al., 2005; Hugill, Fink, Neave, and Seydel, 2009). However, there is
still a dearth of research that highlights the relevance of body movement in human social
perception compared to the large number of studies on static cues (i.e., studies on face and
body morphology) that have been put forward primarily through the expanding field of
evolutionary psychology. This is surprising, given that an inspection of the literature reveals
a considerable number of studies that could be used to stimulate the academic discussion
and research on the importance of body movement, also within the framework of sexual
selection.
Thus, we consider it timely to review some of the key findings on the topic of
human body movement and its relation to mate selection. Firstly, we summarize some
consolidated findings on motion perception, in order to show which kinds of information
humans can perceive out of body movement. Secondly, we outline knowledge about the
biological relevance of such sources of information for human social life. Bearing in mind
such information, we emphasize the importance of body movements in human mate choice
and discuss recent attempts to define its signaling value. Finally, we present some
conclusions and issues for further research.
Perception of human body movement
From the biological perspective it is of paramount importance for the survival of an
organism to decode information based upon the perception of other organisms' movements
(Johansson, von Hofsten and Jansson, 1980; Pavlova, Krägeloh-Mann, Birbaumer, and
Sokolov, 2002; Pollick, Paterson, Bruderlin, and Sanford, 2001; Troje, 2003). In this regard,
humans as highly social creatures are no exception, as they almost constantly gather
information about peoples' gestures and expressions in order to derive information about
their intentions (Blake and Shiffrar, 2007; Troje, 2003). Darwin (1872) already noted in his
book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animal that one can use dynamic rather than
static cues when it comes to an understanding of what others are doing. Consider the variety
of natural situations in which form cues are corrupted through dim lighting conditions or
occlusions. In these situations, the ability to perceive useful visual information is based
predominantly on the motion patterns of an organism (Grossmann and Blake, 1999; Pavlova
et al., 2002). Similar scenarios apply to everyday situations. For example, the gait of a
person has the advantage of primacy in impression formation, since it is often the first cue
that is perceived when a stranger approaches, especially when from a distance (Montepare
and Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988). Humans focus on movement characteristics to collect
socially relevant information about others, and it is a scientific challenge to understand the
form and function of these cues (see also Blake and Shiffrar, 2007).
Point-light-displays and early work
One of the most prominent attempts to understand the signaling qualities of body
movement is the work of Johansson (1973, 1976). He illustrated through the use of simple
point light (PL) displays, that an observer receives a vivid impression of a person`s
movements from the placement of 10-12 lights placed on the major joints of the body
(knees, ankles, elbows etc.). Such strong impressions are reported despite the lack of
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection

important morphological features, such as facial features, skin, or hair (e.g., Barclay,
Cutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Bertenthal and Pinto, 1994), and within extremely short
presentation times of fewer than 200 milliseconds (Johansson, 1976). When observers view
the dot presentations in a static format then the set of elements is never interpreted as a
human body and Johansson (1973, 1976) concluded that humans use motion cues for
recognition. These early studies indicated that humans are sensitive to biological motion,
even when confronted with limited information such as the PL's (Stevenage, Nixon and
Vince, 1999).
Johansson's method appeared to be powerful in the assessment of human body
movement and has stimulated other researchers (and still does). For example, Mather and
West (1993) used the PL technique to demonstrate that humans could also identify animals,
such as goats, baboons, camels, horses and other vertebrates on the basis of motion cues.
Similar perception tasks have been conducted with cats, pigeons, chicks, and non-human
primates as "perceivers", all of which could discriminate biological motion (Blake, 1993;
Chang and Troje, 2008; Dittrich, Lea, Barrett, and Gurr, 1998; Omori and Watanabe, 1996;
Regolin, Tommasi, and Vallortigara, 2000; Vallortigara, Regolin and Marconato, 2005;
Oram and Perrett, 1994). Other studies showed that human infants are predisposed to
selectively attend to biological motion (Fox and McDaniel, 1982; Moore, Goodwin,
George, Axelsson, and Braddick, 2007; Norman, Payton, Long, and Hawkes, 2004;
Pavlova, Krägeloh-Mann, Birbaumer, and Sokolov, 2001; Piotrowski, Jakobson and Troje,
2007). For example, Simion, Regolin and Bulf (2008) revealed that two-day old infants
could discriminate between point-light animations depicting biological motion from those
showing random motion patterns. The same infants selectively preferred to view displays
containing biological motion, especially when depicted in a true (upright) form. Similarly,
Kuhlmeier, Troje and Lee (in press) report that six-month old infants can even discriminate
between leftward and rightward motion from point-light walkers.
Such findings demonstrate that the detection of biological motion is an innate
capacity of the visual system, and is thus according to Simion et al. (2008) "...part of an
evolutionarily ancient and non-species-specific system predisposing animals to
preferentially attend to other animals".
Social perception of motion
Humans can quickly gather visual information from the gait of a counterpart. Such
perceptions are adaptive in the sense that they allow people to successfully interact within
their social environment (Zebrowitz-McArthur and Baron, 1983). Studies on the perception
of PL displays revealed that humans derive a wide range of socially relevant characteristics
from human gait patterns (e.g., Barclay, Cutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Cutting and
Kozlowski, 1977; Kozlowski and Cutting, 1977). For example, observers were able to
determine the action a person performs just on the basis of such highly degraded depictions
such as PL displays (e.g., Dittrich, 1993; Norman et al., 2004; Johansson, 1976). Observers
are also able to decode information about an individual's age (e.g., Montepare and
Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988), identity (e.g., Cutting and Kozlowski, 1977; Hill and Pollick,
2000; Loula, Prasad, Harber, and Shiffrar, 2005; Stevenage, Nixon and Vince, 1999; Troje,
Westhoff, and Lavrov, 2005; Westhoff and Troje, 2007), sex (e.g., Kozlowski and Cutting,
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection

1977, 1978; Mather and Murdoch, 1994; Sumi, 2000; Troje, 2002; Barclay et al., 1978), and
sexual orientation (Ambady, Hallahan, and Conner, 1999) from PL displays alone.
Moreover, observers could identify certain psychological properties from these gait stimuli,
such as an individual's emotional condition (Atkinson, Dittrich, Gemmell, and Young,
2004; Brownlow, Dixon, Egbert, and Radcliff, 1997; Clarke, Bradshaw, Field, Hampson,
and Rose, 2005; Dittrich et al., 1996; Pollick et al., 2001; Walk and Homan, 1984), the aim
of an action (Barrett, Todd, Miller, and Blythe, 2005), the intent to deceive (Runeson and
Frykholm, 1983), and existing alterations of gross motor activity, locomotion, and gait
performance which indicate depression (Lemke, Wendorff, Mieth, Buhl, and Linnemann,
2000; Sloman, Berridge, Homatidis, Hunter, and Duck, 1982). In addition, it is possible to
determine the body size of a walker (Jokisch and Troje, 2003; Troje, 2003), the weight of a
box carried by a person (Runeson and Frykholm, 1983), and even the quality of an
individual's dancing ability (Brown et al., 2005) based on motion cues alone. Individuals
can also identify their own body movements with a fair degree of accuracy, and even detect
their friends from PL displays (Loula et al., 2005).
While the previous paragraphs provide an impressive list of human perceptual
processing from limited information, there is still much to discover about how the
perceptual system actually extracts all of this information from motion cues alone (Todd,
1983). Some attempts to understand the nature of this task come from studies of gender
recognition from gait. For example, Kozlowski and Cutting (1977) introduced a number of
manipulations in computer animations of artificial women such as the amount of arm swing,
walking speed, and occlusion of body parts. However, these authors found a significant
effect only for speed of movement manipulations, such that faster walkers were categorized
as females. In follow-up work, Cutting, Proffitt, and Kozlowski (1978) and Cutting (1981)
showed that signals derived from the shoulder and hip region of a walker are of primary
importance for gender discrimination. Results from lateral comparisons of male and female
body movements conducted by Murray and colleagues (Murray, 1967; Murray, Drought,
and Kory, 1964; Murray, Kory, and Sepic, 1970) revealed that lateral hip and shoulder
rotations are comparable for both sexes and that the amount of upper body sway was greater
in male subjects.
Cutting and colleagues suggested that gender identification might be achieved
indirectly through the determination of a biomechanical invariant referred to as the "center
of moment" (Cm
) of a walker (Barclay, Cutting and Kozlowski, 1978; Cutting, Profitt and
Kozlowski, 1978; Cutting, 1981). The Cm
can be estimated from the widths of the shoulders
and the hips. Thus, the Cm
is higher in females than in males, since the shoulders of males
are wider than the hips and vice versa in females (Cutting and Proffitt, 1981; Cutting,
Proffitt and Kozlowski, 1978). While these studies emphasize the importance of movements
of a walker's upper body (hips and shoulders) for gender recognition, other studies suggest
that the motion of one's lower body (i.e., the legs) provides essential gender information
(Todd, 1983; Yamasaki, Saki and Torii, 1991). According to Runeson and Frykholm (1983)
geometrical and inertial differences are responsible for gender-specific kinematic patterns
and may thus also facilitate gender recognition. In support, Mather and Murdoch (1994)
found that naive observers could identify the gender of an actor very reliably when the
display contained gender-specific lateral body sway. In their experiments, this motion cue
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection

dominates the structural cue based on torso shape (Cm
).
More recently, Troje (2002) made a promising attempt to resolve the problem of
gender recognition from motion displays. He decomposed motion capture data of men and
women, and projected them into a mathematical space. In this space he applied established
methods from linear statistics and pattern recognition to search for axes that best represent
the differences between male and female walkers. As Troje (2003) argued, the results
supported the well-known prototypes: an extreme male walker showed the gait of a hero in
a classical western movie with a straddle-legged posture, the elbows are held away from the
body, and the wide shoulders are performing a lateral body sway. In contrast, a feminine
walker appears rather slim, the elbows are held close to the body and the upper body shows
only little lateral motion, but there is a significant rotation of the hips. Moreover, it seems
that these gender typical movement patterns are present already in infants and becomes
more pronounced during adolescence (König, Schölmerich and Troje, 2008).
In summary, human movement patterns visually communicate social cues to which
other humans are exquisitely sensitive and gender identification seems to be one of the most
obvious signals that can be derived from movement. However, it is likely that there is more
information encoded about an individual than just whether an individual is male or female.
With reference to the quality of movement, it is likely that although there is variation on
male and female body movement the differences between the sexes are probably greater
than within sex, but opposite sex people might also be sensitive to the variation within
individuals of one sex. It is this within-sex variation that interests evolutionary
psychologists in terms of what they have recently been trying to link to an individual's mate
quality.
Body movement in human attractiveness research
Evolutionary psychologists argue that in humans, like in other animals, sexually
selected physical characteristics all pertain to health, thereby suggesting that humans have
evolved to view certain features as attractive and preferable. In this view, human mate
selection criteria have evolved through human evolutionary history and shape our
perception of attractiveness and beauty (Buss, 1989; Gangestad and Scheyd 2005; Rhodes,
Simmons and Peters, 2005). Human socio-sexual encounters are undoubtedly complex, but
there is now a wealth of evidence to suggest that human mate preferences can be
conceptualized within the sexual selection framework and that the principal mechanisms of
mate selection are remarkably universal across cultures (Buss, 1985; Buss and Barnes,
1986; Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Feingold, 1992; Grammer, Fink, Møller, and Thornhill,
2003).
A key problem for assessing possible relationships between physical features and
human mate preferences has been the ecological validity of the stimuli used. Typically,
studies utilize static two-dimensional (2D) stimuli, i.e., facial and/or bodily photographs
(see for review Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzmüller, and Fink, 2003). In real-life mating
situations it is likely that individuals are moving and base their mate preference assessment
(at least initially) on multiple motion and behavioral cues (Rubenstein, 2005).

Viewpoint dependency and presentation mode
Perceiving physical attractiveness from static images of female or male forms seems
to differ from those of moving bodies by changing viewpoint-dependant perceptions of
shape. In a meta-analysis, Langlois et al. (2000) reported that studies in attractiveness
research used different kinds of stimulus presentation modes (photographic images, video
movies and in situ encounters), and these different modes might convey different types of
information, which may subsequently lead to different attractiveness ratings. In support of
this, some researchers also showed that moving stimuli were judged differently on
attractiveness compared to static stimuli (Knappmeyer et al., 2002; Lander, Christie and
Bruce, 1999; Riggio, Widaman, Tucker, and Salinas, 1991).
For example, men's preference for a woman's slim waistline (as indexed via the
waist-to-hip ratio, WHR; Singh, 2002, 2006) was demonstrated only with still images.
However, bodies in motion are dynamic sources of information, and this may have an effect
also on the perception of cues such as the WHR. Doyle (2009) reported a peak shift effect
in the attractiveness perception of WHR when women were moving. He argues that while
walking, motion of the waist and hips results in continuously alternate left and right side
WHR that are perceived as highly attractive. Modeling this in a female model with a WHR
of 0.70 results in left and right side WHRs that are even smaller than 0.70, which are then
perceived as "supernormal" (Doyle, 2009). Likewise, O´Toole, Edelman, and Bülthoff
(1998) demonstrated the existence of a stimulus-specific effect in face recognition over
viewpoint changes. Therefore, it could be that in human social encounters the dynamics of
the face and body provide additional three-dimensional (3D) "representations" (Bloj,
Kersten and Hurlbert, 1999; Knappmeyer et al., 2002), which affect their perception. In real
life situations the face and the body of a person are almost constantly in motion, thus the
perceptions of moving faces and/or bodies could differ from those of static representations
(Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzmüller, and Fink, 2003).
Comparative psychology of body movement
The late American modernist poet Charles Olson once stated that "Men, everywhere,
dance", and "There are no human societies in which they do not", which leads evolutionary
psychologists and anthropologists to the question about the origin of dance in humans, and
the cultural universality of signals derived from biological motion. Darwin (1871) himself
suggested that dance is a sexually selected courtship signal that is related to the quality of
the dancer. This assertion can be regarded as one of Darwin's seminal insights into the
evolutionary mechanisms of behavior in man and animals, given the evidence that dance is
an important signal in mate choice in a variety of animals, including humans. Based on
Darwin's observations of birds, Ellis (1976) provided an evolutionary explanation for
primitive human dance and the "love dances" in many animals. He claimed that the origins
of human dance date back even longer than the origins of modern man, and are thus firmly
rooted in human evolutionary history. Hence, in search of an evolutionary origin of body
movement as a courtship signal it seems worthwhile to consider comparative aspects with
examples also from the animal kingdom.
Courtship dances are observed in many bird species, such as zebra finches
(Taeniopygia guttata) (Williams, 2001), satin bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus)
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(1). 2010. -73-
(Coleman, Patricelli and Borgia, 2004; Patricelli, Uy and Borgia, 2003), duetting thrushes
(Cichladusa guttata) (Todt and Fiebelkorn, 1980), and manikins (Chiroxiphia linearis)
(Trainer and McDonald, 1993). These behavioral displays include movements of the body,
the head, and the beak, but also find their expression in singing, specific postures, plumage
erection and flight performances (Williams, 2001). They are part of a complex courtship
display, which were ultimately designed to attract potential mates. Even female fruit flies
(Drosophila subobscura) choose males on the basis of their ability to dance, which is
interpreted as a signal of their neuromuscular condition (Maynard-Smith, 1956). Likewise,
Rowland (1995) reported that female sticklebacks prefer males with high swimming speed.
Many male spiders, especially the funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis aperta), and several
jumping spiders (Salticidae), have developed elaborate courtship dances, e.g., lateral
swaying of the abdomen and flexing the web, to entice females to mate (Clark and Morjan,
2001; Owens, 2003; Singer et al., 2000). Successful males in the funnel-web spider tend to
sway their abdomens with a higher frequency, than unsuccessful males during courtship
dance (Singer et al., 2000).
The evolutionary origin of dance in human courtship may be perhaps less well
understood through the comparative account of similar patterns in birds or spiders.
However, it is possible that it stems from the courtship displays of non-human primates, as
our closest relatives in evolutionary genealogy (Sheets-Johnstone, 2005). Among primates,
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) move their bodies or heads in courtship displays, aggressive
and frustration behavior (Goodall, 1968). The "bipedal swagger" is a typical behavioral
display in male chimpanzees, which occurs only rarely in females, and is an important part
of courtship display (Goodall, 1968). During this display the male chimpanzee approaches
the female, sits or stands, and extends his hands, lightly touching and then releasing his
head, shoulder, back or knee. His body slowly moves forward and backward and from side
to side (Kano, 1992). Kuroda (1984) observed that during courtship females often do not
receive any visual sign other than the rocking gestures. These examples of motion as a
courtship signal in our closest relatives can possibly give some information about the origin
of dance in human male courtship rather than the examples about the "love-dances" of male
spiders and birds. Sheets-Johnstone (2005) therefore assumes that dance in men has some
evolutionary roots.
Human dance is unique in its style, and is likely related to bipedalism. Bipedalism
facilitates a greater range of movement possibilities than is observed in quadrupeds. Thus, it
seems to be essential for the creative dynamics that constitute the art of dance in humans, as
the torso can twist and bend, the head can swivel, and the arms can swing in many
directions (Sheets-Johnstone, 2005). To this day, few studies have been concerned with how
humans use body movements such as dancing, for attracting mates. Early accounts were
mainly based on ethnographic studies (Kurath, 1960). Later, Kaeppler (1978) provided an
anthropological account of dance by emphasizing that dance is an activity dating back to
prehistoric times that is displayed in rituals as a form of social communication, but also in
courtship activity. Hanna (1987a) discussed the importance of dance in courtship rituals
amongst humans in several societies, including the Acholi in Uganda (p´Bitek, 1966), a
tribe on Mangaia, a southern Cook Island in central Polynesia, and the Medlpa in New
Guinea (Hanna, 1995; Pitcairn and Schleidt, 1976). From the Acholi in Uganda, p´Bitek
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection

(1966) reported that women discriminate between men on the basis of the vigor and
endurance of their dance performance. In India and Morocco, Nevinson (1931) observed
solitary dances that are performed to give pleasure to the opposite sex encounter.
Furthermore, there are some European courtship dances such as the Basque "arresku", the
Norwegian "halling" and the Ukrainian "hopak", in which men show off their physical
prowess. In most societies, not only men dance to attract women, but also women express
themselves through dance in order to receive attention from men.
With reference to evolutionary psychology, Hanna (1987b) points out that dance
may be an adaptive behavioral pattern in sexual selection, as it is a medium, which displays
beauty, health, strength, and thus sexual attractiveness. It is possible, that the disposition to
dance facilitates human mate selection, though the variation in dance patterns and styles is
certainly mediated by culture (Boas, 1944; Hanna, 1987a). However, this view is not
uncontroversial, and some researchers have argued against the hypothesis that dance is
sexually selected. For example, Hagen and Bryant (2003) suggest that dance has evolved as
a coalition signaling system, which communicates coalition quality and thus signals
cooperative behavior. However, these authors also admit that some mate qualities such as
health, nutrition, proper development, endurance, and creativity are signaled via dance
performances ­ and could facilitate the formation of coalitions with members of the
opposite sex.
The quality of body movement
Most of the findings in studies on non-verbal behavior in human courtship were
obtained with the "repertoire analysis method" (Grammer 1990; Grammer, Kruck, Juette,
and Fink, 2000; Moore, 1985; Moore and Butler, 1989; Scheflen, 1965). However, this
approach via pure observation on the basis of operationally defined behavior categories has
several limitations. Categories are sometimes difficult to identify and the definition of some
of them depend on the investigators (subjective) perception. Moreover, behavior categories
can only give an approximation to how a receiver processes the information. Grammer,
Fieder and Filova (1997) and Grammer et al. (1999) found that some information about a
women's courtship behavior is not only inherent in the frequencies of certain postures or
gestures, but also encoded in the quality of body movements. They showed that women
moved more frequently and displayed smaller and slower movements when they were
interested in a man. Men in turn reacted to the quality of these movements positively, and
judged the situation to be more pleasant. Consequently, the quality of body movement
displays could be meaningful in courtship (Grammer, Fink and Renninger, 2002).
Aside from these studies, which give rise to the assertion that the quality of body
movement is an important aspect of courtship behavior in humans, there have been only few
attempts to actually quantify its signaling value. Some studies demonstrated that certain
movements were perceived as being more attractive than others (Grammer, Kiel, Striebel,
Atzmüller, and Fink, 2003; Fink, Seydel, Manning, and Kappeler, 2007; Knappmeyer et al.,
2002; Morrison, Gralewski, Campbell, and Penton-Voak, 2007; Provost, Troje and
Quinsey, 2008b; Sadr, Troje and Nakayana, 2006; Troje, 2003). Grammer, Kiel, Striebel,
Atzmüller, and Fink (2003) found an association between motion quality and the
attractiveness ratings of dance movements. Men and women demonstrating a bigger sweep

in movements were judged as more attractive. In addition, men judged women as more
attractive, the slower and less complex their body movements were. However, Grammer,
Kiel, Striebel, Atzmüller, and Fink (2003) noted some limitation of their study in that they
used movement descriptors which were based on motion history detection, and thus might
not exactly capture the features people use when making judgments about the attractiveness
of body movements.
Troje (2003) again used a PL stimuli approach to investigate the sex-typicality of an
attractive gait. He found that women rated as being highly attractive by men, placed their
feet almost on a straight line whilst walking, thus displaying the typical "cat walk". Johnson
and Tassinary (2005) displayed human walkers varying in terms of shoulder and hip sway.
Observers focused their attention on the waist and hip regions of the body in order to
identify the gender of the walker (i.e., masculine or feminine) and then the sex of the
walker. Johnson, Gill, Reichman, and Tassinary, (2007) extended this research to
demonstrate that observers identified the sexual orientation of computer-generated
animations using assessments of body shape (primarily for women) and body shape and
movement (for both males and females). Gender-atypical body movement had a strong
effect on perceived sexual orientation and also influenced the accuracy of the judgments.
Using motion-capture-technology, Provost, Troje and Quinsey (2008) showed a
contextually dependent shift in the female preference for sex-specific gait patterns in men.
In these experiments, women rated "masculine" walking men as more attractive, especially
when they were in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle and more open to short-term
mating opportunities. Further characteristics, which are inherently signaled via gait, are the
age and height of a walker. Both measures are known to serve as initial criteria in human
mate selection (e.g., Buss, 1989; Kenrick and Keefe, 1992) that could also be conveyed
through body movement. While evolutionary psychologists argue that men have evolved
preferences for youth in females, as this is linked to fertility and health, women place more
emphasis on signs of male status. In this context, Schmitt and Atzwanger (1995) suggest a
sex-specific association between pace and status in men. These authors found that men with
higher status walked faster, whereas the pace of women was independent of their status.
Furthermore these findings were not affected by proximate factors such as age, body height,
next destination, and number of dates.
One central question in human attractiveness research is whether body movement
signals information about an individual's mate quality, and how strong such cues are in
relation to those of the face and body. If dance, for example, is a sexually selected trait, it
should reflect the genetic or phenotypic quality of the dancer.
Body movement and correlates of physical condition
Symmetry
The term "developmental stability" is used to refer to the capacity of the individual
to develop a symmetrical phenotype, thus resisting developmental perturbations caused by
"stress", such as from disease, parasitism, or sex steroids (Livshits and Kobyliansky, 1991;
Thornhill and Møller, 1997). These developmental challenges lead to small deviations in
bilateral symmetry in morphological features and are usually referred to as fluctuating
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(1). 2010. -76-
asymmetry (FA). There is some evidence for the assertion that movement reflects
developmental stability (as measured via FA), from studies of both humans (Manning and
Pickup, 1998) and animals (Garland and Freeman, 2005; Manning and Ockenden, 1994;
Martin and López, 2001; Møller, Sanotra and Vestergaard, 1999; Swaddle, 1997). For
example, Manning and Ockenden (1994) showed that FA in racehorses was a predictor of
their performance. Manning and Pickup (1998) reported that male middle-distance runners
with less body FA were ranked higher within their sport. More recently, Brown et al. (2005)
found positive correlations between FA and the perception of dancing ability in a rural
Jamaican sample of men and women. Similarly, Sadr, Troje, and Nakayama (2006)
collected attractiveness ratings for motion-captured women, displayed as point-light
walkers, and found that an increase of body symmetry was positively associated with
perceived attractiveness of the walkers.
However, as Brown et al. (2005) noted, body symmetry is probably not the only
correlate of variation in movement quality and may be moderated by a number of additional
factors such as neuromuscular coordination, or health, including freedom from parasites.
Moreover, they argued that attractive dances may be particularly difficult to perform, more
rhythmic, more energetic, and more energy efficient (see also Grammer et al., 2003b;
Mattes, Martin and Royer, 2000; Waters and Mulroy, 1999).
Sex steroids
One moderator between body symmetry and quality of movement could be gonadal
sex steroids, such as testosterone (T) and estrogen (E). While asymmetries in movement
may be readily observed as they are determined by skeletal and muscular structures, body
movement may also indicate transient conditions of an individual, such as physiological
states (Grammer, Kiel, Striebel, Atzmüller, and Fink, 2003). Since the 1950's, many top-
class athletes in various sporting disciplines routinely used exogenous T to improve their
performance (Fitch, 2008; Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004). Supra-physiological doses of T
synthesize body protein, which results in an increase of muscle mass and physical strength,
even without exercise (Bhasin et al., 1996; Hartgens and Kuipers, 2004). In some sports,
athletes reported that their intake of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS's) was also
associated with a better recovery, a higher training load capacity and therefore an increase
in physical and mental performances (Baume et al., 2006). Cardinale and Stone (2006)
found a positive correlation between circulating T levels and vertical jump performance in
men and women. However, Siegel et al. (2008), found no relationship between T levels and
sequential movement performance in older and younger males.
Normal movements are partly dependent upon the inter-connected subcortical nuclei
referred to as the "basal ganglia". The key structure is the striatum, and normal functioning
within the basal ganglia is determined by the neurotransmitter dopamine (Albin, Young,
and Penney, 1989). In animals and humans it has been demonstrated that the striatal
dopaminergic system is modulated by estrogen. For example, fluctuations of estrogen
during the estrous cycle in rats are associated with motor performance, with better
performance being associated with estrogen peaks (Becker, Snyder, Miller, Westgate, and
Jenuwine, 1987). Studies on women have showed systematic variations in motor
performance throughout the menstrual cycle (Binkley, 1992; Chrisler and McCool, 1991;
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(1). 2010. -77-
Grammer, Fieder and Filova, 1997; Hampson and Kimura, 1988; Jennings, Janowsky, and
Orwoll, 1998; Lebrun, 1993; Morris and Udry, 1970; Pierson and Lockhart, 1963; Saucier
and Kimura, 1998; Stenn and Klinge, 1972), though the results from these studies are partly
inconclusive.
Morris and Udry (1970) found that women were more active in walking or running
activities at the times of peak fertility compared to other stages of their menstrual cycle.
However, an earlier study by Pierson and Lockhart (1963) found no significant changes in
reaction time and speed of arm movement across the menstrual cycle. More recently,
Provost, Quinsey, and Troje (2008) recorded the kinematics of the walking patterns of
young women at different cycle stages and found that men judged the walking
performances of women in the luteal phase slightly higher on attractiveness than those of
women in the follicular phase. These findings are puzzling in that they contrast previous
reports on men's preferences for women's faces, which found that men rated women as
more attractive at times of peak fertility (Roberts et al., 2004). Here is need for further
investigation before drawing a conclusion on whether static and active cues of women
across the menstrual cycle are perceived differently, or comprise a single ornament of mate
quality that men are sensitive to.
Digit ratio
In addition to the effects of circulating T, studies have shown that in men and
women a low digit ratio (i.e., the relative length of index to ring finger; 2D:4D) - a proxy of
prenatal T - is correlated with physical fitness and high ability in sports, such as skiing
(Manning, 2002), football (Manning and Taylor, 2001), sprinting speed in boys (Manning
and Hill, 2009), athletics (Hönekopp, Manning and Müller, 2006; Pokrywda, Rachon,
Suchecka-Rachon, and Bitel, 2005), and physical strength (Fink, Seydel, Manning, and
Kappeler, 2006). Fink, Seydel, Manning, and Kappeler (2007) presented video clips of male
dancers with low and high 2D:4D ratios to a sample of female judges, who rated them on
perceived attractiveness, dominance, and masculinity. It was found that dances of men with
low (masculine) 2D:4D ratios were rated higher on all three attributes than the dances of
men with high (feminine) 2D:4D ratios. The authors concluded that even prenatal T has an
influence on men's dancing abilities and women's perception of them.
Physical strength
Evolutionary psychologists argue that women have developed certain cognitive
adaptations to visually assess physical fitness, athletic abilities and thus competitiveness in
men, all of which are correlated with T, as mating with high quality males could increase
their reproductive success. Studies on women's preferences for masculine male faces (Fink,
Neave, and Seydel, 2007; Neave, Laing, Fink, and Manning, 2003; Swaddle and Reierson,
2002) and bodies (Sell et al., 2009) support this assertion by suggesting that women possess
cognitive abilities to assess "formidability" (i.e., fighting ability and resource-holding
potential) and physical strength from male face and body morphology. Recent research by
Hugill et al. (2009) suggests that male physical strength is not only signaled via static
representations of the face and body, but also via active displays such as dance. In their
study women perceived dances of men, who were physically stronger (i.e., those with
Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(1). 2010. -78-
higher hand-grip strength), as more attractive and assertive. Thus, it was concluded that the
association of physical strength with dancing ability could be moderated by an effect of T,
whose production and metabolism mobilizes resources for the efforts of males to attract and
compete for mates (Ellison, 2001). These findings are in line with studies, which have
shown that as in most sports, dance fitness depends on the ability to develop high levels of
muscle tension, i.e., muscle strength (Fitt, 1982; Koutedakis and Sharp, 1999), and that this
together with agility, balance, and flexibility are positively associated with dance
performance (Bushey, 1966).
Conclusion
Mate choice is arguably one of the most important decision-making task an
individual has to master during its reproductive life, as via appropriate choice, an individual
can ensure that its genes are passed on to offspring. By selecting a high-quality mate, the
individual can also ensure that shared genes will end up in healthy and fertile offspring
(Gangestad and Thornhill, 1997). Evolutionary psychology theories of mate choice thus
focus on observable features (sexual cues) that are emitted by an individual, and which
indicate valuable information about that individual's reproductive potential and quality.
Although there is some consensus among evolutionary psychologists that evolutionary
selection pressures have led to the development of certain physical characteristics and
preferences for them, a number of open questions in attractiveness research remain. Most
important, almost all studies on physical attraction have used static stimuli (images of faces
and/or bodies). Little is known about the attractiveness of body movements, such as dance
or gait, though both are presumably key signals in everyday life and social encounters. The
apparent sex difference in human body movement leads to the question whether movement
also signals aspects that are relevant for mate choice. Moreover, aside from the potential
physical qualities that are signaled through human motion, could there be also personality
characteristics encoded in the way we walk and/or dance that finally affect attractiveness
assessments and mate preferences?
Studies indicate that humans use dynamic displays in courtship and make
attractiveness decisions on the basis of cues they derive from body movement. Thus, it is
possible, that evolution has shaped our brain in order to process body movement cues of
other individuals in the context of mate selection, similar to evolved preferences for static
morphological features of the face and body. Although the studies we have reviewed in this
article lend some support to the notion that body movement signals information that is
crucial for mate choice, as people are sensitive to the variation in movement styles and
make attractiveness judgments based on them, the results should be regarded as
preliminary. In order to support the hypothesis of an influence of human movement on mate
preferences and actual mating decisions, further research is needed. Such research should
make use of modern technology such as motion capturing, as this provides representations
of real body movement (e.g., Brown et al., 2005; Knappmeyer et al. 2002; Provost, Quinsey
and Troje, 2008; Provost, Troje and Quinsey, 2008; Troje 2002, 2003). The power of such
methods is that they capture the whole range of people's body movement and,
simultaneously, allow subsequent digital alterations and statistical analysis, based on
objective motion descriptors. Here, reflecting trajectories can be used to robustly

reconstruct joint angles of the 3D skeletal animation, and this information can be
transformed onto a virtual human character. Thus, subsequent perception studies will be
able to investigate possible associations of body movement, which is free from physical
form, with numerous biological, physiological and personality characteristics. Such data
will be useful to evolutionary psychologists, studying the signaling qualities of human body
movements in relation to sexual selection, but also to other topics such as human computer
interaction, smart surveillance, athletic performance enhancement and clinical studies.
