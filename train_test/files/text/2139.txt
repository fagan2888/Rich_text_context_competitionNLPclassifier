Research
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical produced in
very high volume, with > 2 million metric tons
produced worldwide in 2003 (Vandenberg
et al. 2009) and used extensively in the
manufacture of epoxy resins, polycarbonate
plastics, and food and beverage containers
(Vandenberg et al. 2009). Consequently, it
is one of the most common environmental
chemical exposures in humans (Calafat et al.
2005). Data from the nationally representative
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) suggest that detectable
levels of BPA are present in the urine of a
majority of U.S. adults (Calafat et al.
2005, 2008).
BPA is considered to be an endocrine-
disrupting chemical, and it has been shown
to have estrogenic and thyroid hormone­
disrupting effects in experimental studies
(Moriyama et al. 2002; Vandenberg et al.
2009). Recent evidence, especially from animal
studies, suggests that BPA exposure may be
related to insulin resistance and have a role in
weight gain and obesity and the subsequent
development of diabetes mellitus (Newbold
et al. 2009; Rubin and Soto 2009). Two recent
human studies reported that higher urinary
BPA levels were associated with self-reported
cardio
vascular disease (CVD) (Lang et al.
2008; Melzer et al. 2010). However, studies
examining the relation between BPA exposure
and more objective measures of CVD are
needed to support this putative association.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a
subclinical measure of atherosclerotic vascular
disease (Newman et al. 1993) that is an
independent predictor of subsequent incident
CVD (Murabito et al. 2003; Newman
et al. 1993). Criqui et al. (1992) reported
that among persons initially free of CVD,
an ankle­brachial index (ABI) of < 0.9 was
associated with a hazard ratio of 6.6 for future
risk of death from coronary heart disease
even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk
factors including age, sex, body mass index
(BMI), smoking, and high cholesterol levels.
Published guidelines (American Diabetes
Association 2003; Hirsch et al. 2006) exist
for defining PAD based on the ABI, which
can be measured even in large population-
based studies (Selvin and Erlinger 2004). In
this context, we examined the independent
association between urinary BPA levels and
PAD among participants in the 2003­2004
NHANES, a representative, multi
ethnic
sample of U.S. adults.
Methods
The present study is based on data from
NHANES 2003­2004. Detailed descriptions
of the NHANES study design and methods
are available elsewhere [National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) 2010b]. Briefly,
the NHANES survey included a stratified
multi
stage probability sample representa-
tive of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S.
population. Selection was based on counties,
blocks, households, and individuals within
households and included the over
sampling of
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
in order to provide stable estimates of
these groups. Participants provided written
informed consent before their participation,
and approval was obtained from the Human
Subjects Committee in the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services. Measurements
of ABI, a subclinical measure of athero
sclerosis
(Criqui et al. 1992; Newman et al. 1993),
were obtained for the subsample of subjects
 40 years of age.
The present study sample consisted
of participants > 40 years of age among
whom urinary BPA was available (n = 971).
We further excluded participants with an
ABI  1.5 (n = 3), which is usually related
to non
compressible blood vessels in the legs
(Newman et al. 1993), as well as those with
missing data on covariates included in the
multi
variable model including level of educa-
tion, smoking status, serum or fasting glu-
cose levels, systolic or diastolic blood pressure
(SBP and DBP, respectively), and cholesterol
levels (n = 215). This resulted in 753 partici
pants (47.9% women), 63 of whom had
PAD. Subjects who were excluded because
of missing covariates were in general similar
to the general NHANES cohort in terms of
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education (data
not shown).
Exposure measurements. Age, sex,
race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake
(grams per day), level of education, history
of diabetes and oral hypoglycemic intake or
insulin administration were assessed using a
questionnaire (NCHS 2010b). Participants
who had not smoked > 100 cigarettes in their
lifetimes were considered never smokers;

Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a common chemical used in the manufacture of 
polycarbonate
plastics and epoxy resins, and > 93% of U.S. adults have detectable levels of urinary BPA. Recent
animal studies have suggested that BPA exposure may have a role in several mechanisms involved in
the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including weight gain, insulin resistance, thyroid
dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. However, few human studies have exam-
ined the association between markers of BPA exposure and CVD. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
is a subclinical measure of atherosclerotic vascular disease and a strong independent risk factor for
CVD and mortality.
Objective: We examined the association between urinary BPA levels and PAD in a nationally rep-
resentative sample of U.S. adults.
Methods: We analyzed data from 745 participants in the National Health and Nutritional
Examination Survey 2003­2004. We estimated associations between urinary BPA levels (in tertiles)
and PAD (ankle­brachial index < 0.9, n = 63) using logistic regression models adjusted for poten-
tial confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, urinary creati
nine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and serum cholesterol levels).
Results: We observed a significant, positive association between increasing levels of urinary BPA
and PAD before and after adjusting for confounders. The multi
variable-adjusted odds ratio for PAD
associated with the highest versus lowest tertile of urinary BPA was 2.69 (95% confidence interval:
1.02, 7.09; p-trend = 0.01).
Conclusions: Urinary BPA levels were significantly associated with PAD, independent of tradi-
tional CVD risk factors.
Key words: ankle­brachial index, bisphenol A, CVD, NHANES, peripheral arterial disease.

those who had smoked > 100 cigarettes in
their lifetimes were considered former smok-
ers if they answered negatively to the question
"Do you smoke now?" and current smokers if
they answered affirmatively.
Rigorous procedures with quality control
checks were used in blood collection, and
details about these procedures are provided
in the NHANES laboratory/medical tech-
nologists procedures manual (NCHS 2010d).
We used the modified hexokinase method to
measure serum glucose levels at the University
of Missouri Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory
(Columbia, MO, USA). Diabetes mellitus was
defined, based on the recent guidelines of the
American Diabetes Association (2011), as a
serum glucose level of > 126 mg/dL after fast-
ing  8 hr or of > 200 mg/dL for those who
fasted < 8 hr before their NHANES visit, a
glycosylated hemoglobin value of > 6.5%, or a
self-reported current use of oral hypo
glycemic
medication or insulin. Seated SBP and DBP
were measured using a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer according to the American Heart
Association and Seventh Joint National
Committee recommendations (Chobanian
2003), and up to three measurements were
averaged. Patients were considered hyper
tensive if they reported current use of blood
pressure­reducing medication or had SBPs
of > 140 mmHg or DBPs of > 90 mmHg
(NCHS 2010b).
In NHANES 2003­2004, serum creati
nine measurements were conducted at the
Collaborative Laboratory Services (Ottumwa,
IA, USA) using the Beckman Coulter
Synchron LX20 chemistry analyzer (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) using the
Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate).
Coefficients of variation ranged from 1.5% to
4.3% (NCHS 2010c). In a calibration sub-
study, serum creati
nine assays were performed
on 190 stored specimens from NHANES
2003­2004 at the Cleveland Clinic labora-
tory (Cleveland, OH, USA) using the Roche
coupled enzymatic assay that was traceable to
gold-standard refer
ence methods, including an
isotope dilution mass spectrometric method
for serum creati
nine using standard references
methods [NIST standard reference material
(SRM) 967; National Institute of Standards
and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA]
and confirmed by analysis of CAP LN-24
(College of American Pathologists Creatinine
Accuracy Calibration Verification/Linearity
Survey) linearity set based on NIST-assigned
values (Selvin et al. 2007). There were no sig-
nificant differences in results between these
two measurements, and therefore it was con-
cluded that there was no correction neces-
sary for serum creati
nine values in NHANES
2003­2004 (Selvin et al. 2007). The glom-
erular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR)
from serum creati
nine using the 
four-variable
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
equation (Levey et al. 2006) as follows:
eGFR =
175 × (serum creati
nine in mg/dL)­1.154
× (age in years)­0.203 × (0.742 if female)
× (1.21 if black).
Chronic kidney disease was defined as an eGFR
of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, consistent with
defini
tions of the National Kidney Foundation
Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative
(KDOQI; National Kidney Foundation
2002) working group and the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (Levey
et al. 2006).
Previous measures of BPA in biologi-
cal matrixes involved techniques such as gas
chromatography or high performance liquid
chromatography (Ye et al. 2005). To achieve
enhanced sensitivity and selectivity over pre-
vious methods, in the current NHANES,
measures of environmental phenols were
derivatized to alkyl or acyl derivatives before
gas chromatography­mass spectrometry analy-
sis (NCHS 2010a). The lower limit of detec-
tion for BPA concentrations was 0.36 ng/mL.
Main outcome of interest: PAD. For study
subjects with at least one arm and weigh-
ing  400 lb, supine SBP was measured
with blood pressure cuffs on the right arm,
compressing the brachial artery and the two
posterior tibial arteries (NCHS 2010a). For
subjects 40­59 years of age, two measure-
ments were taken at each site and averaged,
and for patients  60 years of age, one measure
was taken at each site. For subjects with condi-
tions precluding the measurement of the right
arm, left brachial artery SBP was taken. Left
and right ABI values were calculated as the
ratio of left and right ankle SBP, respectively,
to arm SBP. The smallest of the left and right
ABI measurements was used. Patients with
ABIs  1.5 (n = 3) are expected to have severe
arterial rigidity and were excluded from the
present analyses (Newman et al. 1993). For
these analyses, PAD was defined as ABI < 0.9
(American Diabetes Association 2011; Selvin
and Erlinger 2004). Because of the selection
criteria for ABI measurements in NHANES
(subjects  40 years of age), subjects who had
ABI measurements taken were significantly
older than the general NHANES cohort but
were otherwise similar with respect to demo-
graphic factors (data not shown).
Statistical analysis. Urinary BPA was
categorized into tertiles (< 1.4 ng/mL,
1.4­3.5 ng/mL, > 3.5 ng/mL). We hypothe
sized that high BPA levels are associated with
PAD. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for PAD in association with
BPA were calculated by taking the lowest
tertile (tertile 1) as the referent, using multi
variable logistic regression models. We used
two models: one adjusted only for age and sex,
and a multi
variable model that also adjusted
for race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),
education (< high school, high school, > high
school), household income (< $25,000,
$25,000­54,999,  $55,000), smoking status
(never, former, current), pack-years of smok-
ing, alcohol intake (non
drinker, moderate
drinker, heavy drinker), BMI (normal, over-
weight, obese), hypertension (present, absent),
diabetes (present, absent), urinary creati
nine
(milligrams per deciliter), eGFR (milliliters
per minute per 1.73 m2), and total cholesterol
(milligrams per deciliter). Trends in the OR of
PAD across increasing urinary BPA categories
were determined by modeling BPA as an ordi-
nal variable. We examined effect modification
by performing stratified analysis by categories
of sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, diabetes mellitus,
and hypertension. We also conducted formal
statistical tests for inter
action by including
multiplicative cross-product interaction terms
in the multi
variable logistic regression models;
p < 0.1 was interpreted as a statistically signifi-
cant interaction. Sample weights that account
for the unequal probabilities of selection, over-
sampling, and non-response were applied for all
analyses using SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN soft-
ware (version 10; RTI International, Research
Triangle Park, NC, USA); SEs were estimated
using the Taylor series linearization method.
Results
The median (interquartile range) of uri-
nary BPA levels was 2.30 (3.60) ng/mL; the
25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values were
1.00, 2.30, and 4.60 ng/mL, respectively.
Participants with higher levels of BPA were
more likely to be men, non-Hispanic blacks,
and former or current smokers and had higher
levels of urinary creati
nine. Table 1 shows
these characteristics for the study popula-
tion by teriles of urinary BPA levels. Overall,
we observed a positive association between
increasing BPA levels and PAD on the basis
of the age- and sex-adjusted model and the
multi
variable-adjusted model, with significant
(p < 0.05) trend tests (Table 2). This positive
association persisted when BPA was analyzed
as a continuous variable (1-SD increase in log-
transformed BPA).
In a supplementary analysis, we examined
the association between BPA levels and PAD
after excluding n = 10 subjects with very high
BPA values (levels > 30 ng/mL). The results
were found to be essentially simi
lar. The multi
variable OR of PAD associated with 1 SD of
log-transformed BPA was 1.60 (1.16­2.21).
We also examined the association between
increasing tertiles of BPA and self-reported
CVD, and the magnitude of association
was found to be weaker than that for PAD.

Environmental Health Perspectives · volume 120 | number 9 | September 2012 1299
Compared to tertile 1 of BPA (referent),
the multi
variable-adjusted OR (95% CI) of
self-reported CVD was 1.09 (0.18­6.60) for
tertile 2, and 1.83 (1.01­3.31) for tertile 3
(p-trend = 0.02).
Discussion
In a large multiethnic, nationally representa-
tive sample, we found that increasing serum
BPA levels were strongly associated with
PAD. The observed association was indepen-
dent of the confounding factors of smoking,
BMI, alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, hyper-
tension, and serum cholesterol level. Our
study adds to the emerging evidence suggest-
ing a role for environmental exposure to BPA
in cardiovascular disease in humans (Lang
et al. 2008; Melzer et al. 2010). Furthermore,
because PAD and low ABI are markers of
athero
sclerosis, our findings suggest that
potential effects of BPA on athero
sclerosis
may be a mechanism underlying the previ-
ously reported association between BPA expo-
sure and self-reported CVD (Lang et al. 2008;
Melzer et al. 2010).
BPA is an environmental chemical used
as a constituent monomer in polycarbonate
plastics, which are used extensively in drink
containers and food packaging and in the
production of oxidants used in the lining
of canned goods (Vandenberg et al. 2009).
Exposure to BPA is believed to be mainly
through dietary intake with additional expo-
sure through water, dental sealants, inhalation
of household dusts, and exposure through
skin (Vandenberg et al. 2009). Recent studies
from NHANES data have documented that
> 93­95% of the general U.S. population has
measurable concentrations of BPA metabo-
lites in their urine (Calafat et al. 2005, 2008).
Several lines of recent evidence suggest
that an association between urinary BPA lev-
els and PAD may be biologically plausible.
Animal studies have suggested that BPA
exposure may have a role in CVD develop-
ment through several mechanisms, including
the role of BPA in weight gain and obesity
development potentially through its action
on pre
adipocytes (Masuno et al. 2005;
Phrakonkham et al. 2008), role as an estro-
gen (Rubin and Soto 2009), potential inter
actions with estrogen-related receptor gamma
(Matsushima et al. 2008), actions as a thyroid
hormone antagonist (Moriyama et al. 2002),
role as a peroxisome proliferator­activated
receptor gamma antagonist (Wright et al.
2000) and its role in influencing pancreatic
endocrine function (Ropero et al. 2008).
Alonso-Magdalena et al. (2006) showed that
mice with long-term exposure to environ-
mentally relevant levels of BPA developed
hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and
glucose intolerance. Furthermore, in ani-
mal models BPA has been shown to induce
endothelial cell injury mediated through oxi-
dative stress (Hennig et al. 2002; Ooe et al.
2005; Stegeman et al. 1995) and elevations in
lipids (Marmugi et al. 2012). However, there
are few studies in humans for comparison.
Two of the few human studies (Lang et al.
2008; Melzer et al. 2010) reported positive
associations between urinary BPA levels and
self-reported CVD. Also, BPA levels were
found to be associated with abnormal liver
function enzymes and higher levels of fasting
glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR (homeo
stasis
model of assessment--insulin resistance) (Lang
et al. 2008; Melzer et al. 2010), all points sug-
gesting that BPA may have a role in CVD. It
is in this context that our results on objectively
measured ABI to define PAD are important.
In the present study, we have demonstrated
a significant, positive association between
higher BPA 
levels and PAD that persisted after
adjustment for multiple confounders.
The main strengths of our study include
its nationally representative sample and use
of rigorous study methods to collect the
data and the availability of extensive data on
confounders (NCHS 2010a, 2010b). The
main study limitation is that the present
study is cross-
sectional in nature, therefore
making it impossible to confirm that exposure
preceded the outcome. Another limitation is
the possibility of residual confounding. For
example, despite adjusting for education and

income, the observed association between BPA
levels and PAD may be at least partly explained
by residual confounding by low socioeconomic
status. Future prospective studies are required
to confirm or disprove our findings. A third
limitation is that because ABI measures were
available only in NHANES 2003­2004,
we are not able to examine data from the
recent NHANES cycles such as NHANES
2005­2006, where BPA levels may be lower.
Fourth, the use of urinary BPA levels measured
from a single spot sample is likely to result
in some misclassifi
cation because of the large
variability of BPA. Therefore, to provide the
best approach for BPA exposure assessment,
expert panels have recommended collection
of multiple (rather than single) spot urine
samples and study designs that consider
important exposure contributors such as the
time of the day of sampling (e.g., in relation
to food consumption) and the time of last
urination (World Health Organization/Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations Expert Panel 2011). Finally, urinary
BPA levels may not be reflective of the free,
unconjugated, circulating BPA in blood, which
is considered to be the biologically active form.
Future studies examining the health effects
of BPA should preferably measure this free,
unconjugated part of BPA in serum.
Conclusions
In a nationally representative sample of U.S.
adults, higher BPA levels were positively
associated with PAD after adjusting for con-
founding factors such as age, sex, smoking,
BMI, alcohol intake, diabetes, hypertension,
and cholesterol levels. Although our findings
must be confirmed in other studies, they pro-
vide preliminary evidence that environmental
exposure to BPA may contribute to PAD.
