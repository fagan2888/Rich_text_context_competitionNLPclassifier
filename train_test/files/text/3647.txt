Homophily ­ the tendency to associate with others who are
similar to oneself ­ is ubiquitous in social relations
(McPherson et al., 2001). Recently, the log-linear distance
model has been used innovatively to model homophily on
ordinal and dichotomous variables in small groups of crimi-
nal accomplices (Carrington, 2015a, 2015b); however, the
methods are equally applicable to any small groups.Although
the methods are introduced in the cited sources, their expla-
nation of the methods is very brief. This article explains the
methods in detail. It discusses the conceptualisation and
operationalisation of homophily, traces the development of
the application of the log-linear distance model to homophily
and its advantages over the well-known Coleman index,
shows how it can be applied to small groups and reviews the
recent applications (Carrington, 2015a, 2015b). No new
results are reported: the purpose of this article is to put the
recent applications in conceptual and historical context and
to make the model accessible to potential users.
Conceptualising homophily
Homophily has been defined as `the principle that a contact
between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among
dissimilar people' (McPherson et al., 2001: 416). Mayhew et
al. (1995) characterise homophily as `the social distance
interaction hypothesis': `The frequency with which people
enter into face-to-face association (contact, interaction) is
inversely related to the social distance between them' (p. 20).
Thus, according to the principle, or hypothesis, of homophily,
the highest rate of interaction is expected between people
who are in the same category of a discrete variable (e.g. both
male) or who have the same value on a continuous variable
(e.g. same age), that is, whose social distance is zero.
As the definition of McPherson et al. (2001) implies, the
phenomenon of observed homophily, or homogeneity in
social relationships, does not in itself imply any particular
explanation. In particular, it is not necessarily due to personal
choice (Mayhew et al., 1995: 20). Explanations of observed
homophily generally fall into three categories:
1. Population composition: This might be characterised
as the `null' hypothesis. The selection of interaction
partners is influenced simply by the availability of
potential partners. If partners are selected at random,
then their characteristics will reflect the distribution of
those characteristics in the population or pool of poten-
tial partners. If the population is distributed unevenly
over categories or values of some attribute, then
Log-linear distance models of homophily in
small groups
Peter J Carrington
Abstract
This article demonstrates the innovative use of the log-linear distance model in the assessment of homophily in a set of small
groups, such as the co-participants in a set of events. It traces the development of the application of the log-linear distance
model to the study of homophily and reviews its recent use to assess the extent and structure of gender and age homophily
in groups of criminal accomplices (`co-offenders'). The transformations of the group membership data that are a prerequisite
of the log-linear analysis, and the interpretation of the log-linear parameters, are explained in detail in order to make the
approach accessible to potential users. Although the described applications are to gender and age homophily in groups of
criminal accomplices, the method can be used to assess homophily on one or more variables in any small groups.

­ assuming random selection of partners ­members of
the numerical majority group(s) will be more likely to
select similar partners, and homophily will be observed
(Blau, 1977).1 McPherson et al. (2001: 419) refer to
this as baseline homophily. For example, because the
great majority of criminals are male, random (i.e. gen-
der-blind) selection of accomplices would, ceteris
paribus, produce a high proportion of homophilous
male co-offending groups (and a smaller number of
mixed-gender and all-female groups), and that is pre-
cisely what has been observed in numerous studies of
co-offending (van Mastrigt and Carrington, 2014).
2. Preference: For various reasons, people prefer to
associate and collaborate with those who are similar
to them. According to McPherson et al. (2001), `the
psychology literature has demonstrated experimen-
tally that attraction is affected by perceived similarity
...'(p. 435). Similarly, in the area of professional col-
laboration, Steffensmeier and Terry (1986) concluded
on the basis of interviews with male thieves that they
preferred same-gender accomplices because they
were perceived as more reliable and trustworthy.
3. Social structure: Features of the social structure
apart from overall population composition may con-
stitute `opportunity structures' that favour homo-
philous contact and collaboration. For example,
McPherson et al. (2001) point out that `organiza-
tional foci', such as neighbourhood play groups,
schools, workplaces and voluntary organisations,
bring together people who are similar in age, ethnic-
ity, socioeconomic status and sometimes gender
(pp. 431­434). Felson (2003) describes `conver-
gence settings', where local youth `hang out' and
have the opportunity to meet and screen potential
criminal accomplices. Such `opportunity [to meet
and screen] structures' are often partly or entirely
segregated by age, gender, ethnicity and so on, thus
restricting the pools of potential partners to similar
people. Waring (2002), Schwartz et al. (2015) and
others (reviewed in van Mastrigt and Carrington,
2014) have noted that it is the `local' availability
and accessibility of potential criminal partners,
rather than their distribution in the larger popula-
tion, that affect partner selection and that local
availability and accessibility are structured by social
networks based on family, friendship, neighbour-
hood and so on. Pettersson (2003) shows that resi-
dential ethnic segregation leads to ethnic segregation
(homophily) in co-offending, although individual
preferences may tend towards ethnic heterogeneity.
As the `baseline' homophily that can be accounted for by
random selection and population composition is often of lit-
tle theoretical or substantive interest,2 some researchers
restrict the definition and study of homophily to that which
exceeds expectations under random selection ­ sometimes
termed inbreeding bias or inbreeding homophily (Coleman
1958; Currarini et al., 2009; Currarini and Redondo, 2011;
Fararo and Sunshine, 1964; Laumann and Pappi, 1976: 55;
McPherson et al., 2001: 419; Marsden, 1988; van Mastrigt
and Carrington, 2014). For example, Coleman (1958:
Appendix B) conceptualises homophily in sociometric
choices as the extent to which the number of actual choices
of persons in the same category as the chooser exceeds the
number expected under random selection. Coleman's (1958:
36) index of homophily is category-specific
h

m e

where hi
is the (inbreeding) homophily of persons in cate-
gory i, aii
is the number of same-category choices made by
members of category i, mi
is the total number of choices
made by persons in category i and eii
is the expected number
of same-category choices by persons in category i, under
random selection, which is equal to mi
multiplied by the pro-
portion of persons of category i in the population.
Limitations of the Coleman index
Although the Coleman index of inbreeding homophily has
been used extensively (for recent applications, see, for exam-
ple, Currarini et al., 2009; Currarini and Redondo, 2011; van
Mastrigt and Carrington, 2014), it has several limitations:
·
· It is based on a binary conceptualisation of similarity:
persons chosen are either of the same category or not.
This can be seen in formula (1). Therefore, its applica-
tion is limited to dichotomous variables or to polyto-
mous variables that can be analysed as dichotomies.
The notion of social distance ­ other than `same/dif-
ferent' ­ is unknown.
·
· The estimate of homophily that it produces is cate-
gory-specific. No overall estimate of homophily in the
population is available.
·
· Its sampling distribution is unknown, so there is no
known standard error and therefore no inferential sta-
tistics such as confidence intervals or significance
tests.
·
· It is not readily incorporated into a multivariate model,
in which, for example, homophily can be assessed
while controlling other relevant variables.
The log-linear distance model
The limitations of the Coleman index of homophily do not
apply to the log-linear distance model. It applies to ordinal
(and dichotomous) variables, it has a well-understood sam-
pling distribution and therefore a standard error, from which
confidence intervals and significance tests can be derived,
Carrington 3
and it is part of the statistically well-developed and well-
understood log-linear model and, more generally, of the gen-
eralised linear model (Agresti, 2013: Chapters 9­11).
The simplest log-linear distance model is applied to a
square cross-tabulation H(i, j) of pair-wise interactions, or
dyads, in which the rows and columns represent the catego-
ries of the same ordinal (or dichotomous) attribute, and the
cells (i, j) contain counts of the number of dyads comprising
an actor in category i and an actor in category j. The model
can be written as
log µ
ij ij
d
= + + +
   
i
X
j
X (2)
where µij
is the count (i.e. frequency of dyads) in cell (i, j), X
is the row and column variable, indexed by i (rows) and j
(columns) and d i j
= | |.
-
Like all conventional log-linear models for two-way
tables, the distance model includes an intercept parameter ,
parameterising the overall frequency,3 and row and column
parameters 
i
X and 
j
X  parameterising the overall (marginal)
frequency of each row and column, thus capturing the effects
of population composition on interaction frequencies (Agresti,
2013: 340).4 In addition, the distance model includes the
parameter , which captures the effect of social distance: in
this case, the distance ­ that is, difference ­ between catego-
ries of the variable.Thus, the  parameter captures the strength
and direction of the association between attribute-based social
distance and the frequency of interactions while controlling
for population composition. Inbreeding homophily is indi-
cated by cell counts that decrease for cells at increasing dis-
tances from the main diagonal of the cross-tabulation. As the
dij
term measures the distance between categories i and j, a
positive estimate of  indicates that cell frequencies increase
with increasing differences between i and j ­ that is, heteroph-
ily ­ and a negative estimate indicates homophily.
Development
The log-linear distance model was introduced by Goodman
(1972, 1979: model 7, p. 810; see also Breiger, 1981;
Haberman, 1974)5 for square ordinal social mobility tables,
in which cell counts (i, j) indicate the number of father­son
dyads for which father is in the ith occupational class and son
is in the jth occupational class. Cells on the main diagonal ­
where i=j and father and son are in the same occupational
class ­ indicate social immobility (`status inheritance'; i.e.
inheritance by a son of his father's occupational class); cells
at increasing distances from the main diagonal indicate
increasing amounts of upward or downward social mobility.
The  parameter (in model 2 above) captures the strength of
the association between the number of occupational classes
(|i-j|) separating father and son and the number of father­
son dyads in cell (i, j), that is, the extent to which social
mobility exceeds expectations based on random placement
of sons in occupational classes.
Marsden (1988) applied the log-linear distance model to
analyse homophily in personal networks. The 1985American
General Social Survey captured data on the characteristics of
up to five persons with whom respondent `discussed impor-
tant matters'. Marsden (1988) transformed the data into (up
to) five respondent­alter dyads for each respondent and then
constructed cross-tabulations ­ on age, education, race/eth-
nicity, religion and gender ­ with rows representing respond-
ents, columns representing alters and counts of dyads in the
cells. Various forms of the log-linear distance model were
applied to these cross-tabulations in order to assess the
amount and structure of homophily on each attribute of
respondents' choices of discussion partners.
Extension to small groups
The log-linear distance model applies to a cross-tabulation of
dyadic interactions: the categories of the variable to which the
two members of the dyad belong are indexed in the rows and
columns of the cross-tabulation. Therefore, it is inapplicable to
interactions involving more than two actors and therefore to
groups of more than two members.6 However, any `small' or
`face-to-face' group incorporates a set of dyadic, or pair-wise,
interactions or relationships: a group of size n generates
n(n-1)/2dyads (Mayhew et al., 1995: 25­27). This phenom-
enon is limited to `small' groups because in larger groups it is
unrealistic to assume that all members interact with all other
members (Mayhew et al., 1995: 25). As Schaefer (2012)
writes, in justifying the omission of larger groups from a study
of social versus spatial distance in criminal collaborations,
The assumption is made that individuals who were part of the
same offense [i.e. co-offending group] had a social relationship.
Two offenses were dropped from the data because they had such
a high number of participants (23 and 54) that they likely
violated this assumption. (p. 143)
Stegbauer and Rausch (2012) showed how lists of the
members of a set of small groups of varying sizes can be
used to generate a cross-tabulation of co-participating
dyads, without knowledge of the identities of the members.
Specifically, they transformed a list of the nationalities of
the co-participants in a set of events (namely, sessions at an
academic conference) into a set of co-participating dyads,
labelled by the nationalities of the members, which in turn
were used to generate a cross-tabulation of the frequencies
with which people of different (and the same) nationalities
co-participated in conference sessions. As nationality is a
polytomous nominal variable, the concept of social distance
was inapplicable, as was the log-linear distance model.
Carrington (2015b) extended the method of Stegbauer and
Rausch (2012) to analyse age homophily among co-offenders
(accomplices in crimes) apprehended by police in connection
with all recorded co-offences in Canadian police during 2006­
2009. Like Stegbauer and Rausch (2012), Carrington (2015b)
4 Methodological Innovations
began with information on one characteristic of each of the
co-participants in a set of events: specifically, the age in years
of each of the offenders. The distance model was particularly
appropriate because age (unlike nationality in the research of
Stegbauer and Rausch, 2012) is an ordered attribute and was
coded in the data as an ordinal variable, with values from 3 to
88years. The co-offences in the data ranged in size (i.e. number
of recorded participants) from 2 to 44 co-offenders, but the
great majority had only 2 or 3 co-offenders.
Following the method of Stegbauer and Rausch (2012),
Carrington (2015b) created a square symmetric cross-tabula-
tion with 86 rows and columns, representing ages from 3 to 88
inclusive. Cell counts (i, j) indicated the number of co-offend-
ing dyads in which a person aged i+2 co-offended with a per-
son aged j+2. Formally, the age-by-age co-offending matrix is

For example, Figure 1(a) shows three hypothetical co-
offences labelled A, B and C, involving nine co-offenders
aged 3­7years. The first co-offence has five co-offenders, of
whom two are 3years old, and one each is 5, 6 and 7years
old. This co-offence comprises 10 co-offending dyads: Jack­
Joe, Jack­Harry, Jack­Walter, Jack­Mac, Joe­Harry and so
on The second and third co-offences have only two co-
offenders each and therefore comprise only one co-offending
dyad each; in the second, they are both 4years old, and in the
third, they are 5 and 6years old. Figure 1(b) shows the result-
ing rows of the incidence matrix M.

When M is pre-multiplied by its transpose, the result is a

2; for example, in the example in Figure 1, two
3-year-olds co-offended with one 5-year-old in co-offence A
and none in co-offence B or C, so the value for MTM1,3
(and
for MTM3,1
) is 2. This adjacency matrix is symmetric, so the
upper (or lower) triangle is redundant. However, the diago-
nal cells of MTM (shaded in Figure 1(c)) have incorrect val-
ues of 4, 4, 2, 2, 1 for numbers of co-offences between
offenders of the same age. Stegbauer and Rausch (2012: 4)
correct the diagonal entries with the formula

where s is the number of rows in M, which in the example
gives the correct diagonal entries of 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 (Figure 1(d)),
indicating the single co-offence between 3-year-olds (in co-
offence A; see Figure 1(a)) and between 4-year-olds (in co-
offence B) and no same-age co-offences between 5-, 6- and
7-year-olds. A further correction was required in the
Carrington (2015b) research, as the log-linear models were
applied to the entire symmetric matrix, unlike the analysis in
Stegbauer and Rausch (2012), where only the lower triangle
was analysed. In MTM, each off-diagonal dyad is double-
counted: once in the lower triangle and once in the upper
triangle. In order to eliminate the double-counting, the modi-
fied formula used by Carrington (2015b) also divides the off-
diagonal cell counts by 2

where s is the number of rows in M, giving the cell counts

The age-by-age matrix H in Carrington (2015b) contains
970,084 co-offending dyads: 176,503 dyads where both
offenders are of the same age in years (i.e. on the main diago-
nal) and 793,581 dyads involving offenders of different ages.
The distribution of ages of co-offending dyads is strongly
affected by the row and column marginals ­ that is, the num-
bers of co-offenders of each year of age ­ which range from
31 dyads that include an 88-year-old to 106,696 dyads that
include a 19-year-old. The effect of population composition
- that is, the row and column marginal effects - can be
removed by taking the normalized residuals from the log-
linear independence model (Agresti, 2013: 339)7:
log µ
ij

i
X
j
X (3)
where µij
is the count (i.e. frequency of interactions) in cell (i,
j) and X is the row and column variable, indexed by i and j.
The marginals can be plotted in an age-by-age matrix
(Figure 2). In Figure 2, the density of the shading of cells is
proportional to the normalised residual. As predicted by the
homophily hypothesis, co-offending is greater than expected
(from population composition) on and near the main diagonal
(red cells) and less than expected off the diagonal (green cells).
This is confirmed by the distance parameter estimate  from
the log-linear distance model (formula (2)), which was
-0.1398 (standard error (SE)
=
0.0002, p<0.0001): that is,
negative and statistically significant (Carrington, 2015b:
345­346).
Further hypotheses based on age-by-age cross-tabulation
were tested in Carrington (2015b), primarily concerning var-
iations in homophily with co-offenders' ages ­ which can be
seen in Figure 2, where homophily appears to be stronger
among teenagers and children and practically non-existent
among older co-offenders. This phenomenon was modelled
by the `variable distance' model, which allows the effect of
social distance to vary

where d=|i-j| and s=i+j (Carrington, 2015b: formula 2,

The 2
parameter represents an interaction between het-
erophily and age; a positive estimate for 2
indicates that age
heterophily increases ­ that is, age homophily decreases ­
with an increase in the sum of the ages of the members of the
dyad. Carrington (2015b) also tested hypotheses and models
that added social distance based on age groups to distance
based on year of age. The concept of `age group' and models
for it are discussed in the following section.
Extension to two variables
Carrington (2015a) extended the approach of Carrington
(2015b) to model homophily on two variables (gender and
age) simultaneously. Homophily on each variable was esti-
mated while controlling for homophily on the other variable
(as well as for population composition), and the interaction
between homophily on the two variables was estimated: that
is, whether or not co-offending between occupants of certain
pairs of categories of the two variables occurred more or less
frequently than expected on the basis of homophily on each
of the variables individually.
Carrington (2015a) used the same data as Carrington
(2015b), but the age range was trimmed to 5­75years in order
to have at least 10 female co-offenders for each year of age.
The result was a reduction to 968,712 co-offending dyads. As
with Stegbauer and Rausch (2012) and Carrington (2015b),
the dyads were transformed into a cross-tabulation, but in this
case it was a four-dimensional 71 × 71 × 2 × 2 cross-tabulation
by age and gender simultaneously: H=(hijkl
), in which each
cell hijkl
is a count of the number of dyads in which the age of
the first member is indexed by i and his or her gender by k, and
the age of the other member is indexed by j and his or her
gender by l. Formally, the cross-tabulation is denoted by
6 Methodological Innovations
H = h

l={1, 2}, labelled by {`Male', `Female'}; and hijkl
=hjilk
the
number of co-offending dyads whose members have the
ages indexed by i and j and genders indexed by k and l.
To transform the individual co-offending groups into
dyads, they were first transformed into two weighted inci-
dence matrices M and F, for male and female co-offenders
M = m
ij
( )
where i={1, 2, ... , 442,534}, indexing co-offences; j={1, 2,

5, 6, ..., 75; and mij

the number of participations in co-
offence i of male offenders of age j.
F = f

where i={1, 2, ... , 442,534}, indexing co-offences, j={1, 2,
... , 71}, indexing participations of female offenders with
ages 5, 6, ... ,75, and fij
= the number of participations in co-
offence i of female offenders of age j.
For example, Figure 3(a) shows three co-offences labelled
A, B and C, involving nine co-offenders aged 5­9years. The
first co-offence has five co-offenders, all male, of whom two
are 5years old and one each is 7, 8 and 9years old. This co-
offence generates 10 co-offending dyads. The second and
third co-offences have only two co-offenders each and gen-
erate one dyad each; in the second co-offence, they are both
6
years old and of different genders, and in the third co-
offence, they are 7 and 8years old and of different genders.
Figure 3(b) shows the resulting incidence matrices M and F.
When M is pre-multiplied by its transpose, the result is a
square adjacency matrix MTM (Figure 3(c)), showing the
number of times that male offenders of age i co-offended
with male offenders of age j; for example, in the example in
Figure 3, two 5-year-old males co-offended with one 7-year-
old male in co-offence A and none in co-offence B or C, so
the value for MTM1,3
(and for MTM3,1
) is 2. However, the
diagonal cells of MTM (shaded in Figure 3(c)) have incorrect
values of 4, 1, 1, 2, 1 for numbers of co-offences between
male offenders of the same age. The Stegbauer and Rausch

Negative residuals are shaded in green and positive residuals in red. Darkness of shading is proportional to the size of the residual.

mula below) gives the correct diagonal entries of 1, 0, 0, 0, 0

5-year-olds (in co-offence A; see Figure 3(a)) and no same-
age co-offences between male 6- to 9-year-olds:

As in Carrington (2015b; see preceding section), a further

each off-diagonal dyad is double-counted: once in the lower
triangle and once in the upper triangle. In order to eliminate
the double-counting and preserve the correct total number of
co-offending dyads, the modified formula also divides the

male*male slice of H, or H11
=(hij11
), where the last two sub-
scripts, 1 and 1, index male gender (Figure 3(d)).
The same procedure was followed to produce the
female*female co-offending adjacency matrix H22
=(hij22
)
and the male*female co-offending matrix H12
=(hij12
) and its
transpose, the female*male co-offending matrix H21
=(hij21
)
(Figure 3(c) and (d)).
The 71×71×2×2 cross-tabulation of co-offending dyads
was then reduced to a 3×3×2×2 cross-tabulation by aggre-
gating years of age into age statuses, which Carrington
(2015a) argues are more sociologically and criminologically
relevant than merely chronological years of age or the ad hoc
groupings of ages into `age groups' in Carrington (2015b).
Following Burt (1991), dyadic co-offending frequencies
were row- and column-normalised using iterative propor-
tional fitting (IPF),8 in order to remove the effects of varying
volumes of co-offending by members of different year-of-age
groups. Distances (dissimilarities) between the co-offending
patterns of each pair of years-of-age were calculated as
the Euclidean distance between the corresponding pair
of rows (or, equivalently, columns) in the two-dimensional

8 Methodological Innovations
normalised co-offending frequencies (Burt, 1991). Two
methods were used to cluster the years of age in the resulting
71×71 distance matrix: visual examination of a multidimen-
sional scaling (MDS) plot and Ward's hierarchical agglom-
erative clustering method.9 For Ward's clustering, the choice
of the number of clusters was assisted by plots of the pseudo-
F statistic and pseudo-t2 statistic against the number of clus-
ters (Cooper and Milligan, 1988). Ward's clustering solution
suggested either three clusters ­ 5­11, 12­17 and 18­75years
­ or four clusters, with 18­75years split into 18­45 and 46­
75years. The MDS plot (Figure 4) suggests (the same) three
age clusters: 5­11, 12­17 and 18­75years. Although derived
from a clustering based on (dis-)similarities in co-offending
patterns, these age clusters correspond exactly to the three
age categories defined in Canadian criminal law: children
(5­11years), who cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences;
youth (12­17
years), who are under the jurisdiction of the
youth justice system; and adults, who are under the jurisdiction
of the ordinary criminal justice system (Carrington, 2015a).10
The estimates for the gender and age status heterophily
parameters were both negative and statistically significant
(-0.757 and -1.897, respectively), indicating gender homo-
phily and even stronger age status homophily among the co-
offenders. The estimate for the interaction between gender
and age status was 0.323 (SE=0.008, p<0.0001), indicating
that dyads comprising a young female and an adult male are
more frequent than expected from the main effects of gender
and age, that is, gender and age status homophily are mutu-
ally attenuating, not reinforcing (Carrington, 2015a).
Limitations
The log-linear model of homophily in groups is a `dyad-inde-
pendent' model that assumes there are no connections
between groups (Handcock et al., 2008). Where data are
available on connections between groups ­ that is, if informa-
tion is available on the presence of the same persons in two or
more groups ­ then a model such as the exponential random
graph model (ERGM) is, in principle, more appropriate
because it can estimate homophily (using the same underly-
ing distance model) while controlling for network effects
(Robins and Daraganova, 2013: 93). However, there are limi-
tations to the size of population that can be modelled with an
ERGM (Robins and Lusher, 2013), whereas the approach
described here is insensitive to population size, as the nodes
are aggregated into categories of the classificatory variable.
The log-linear distance model also has the limitation that
the transformation of groups into dyads, preparatory to con-
struction of the cross-tabulation required by the log-linear
model, loses information about group size. As homophily
has been found to be related to group size (McPherson et al.,
2001; Mayhew et al., 1995; van Mastrigt and Carrington,
2014), this may be an issue in some applications.
Conclusion
The log-linear distance model is a powerful and flexible
way of modelling inbreeding homophily in small discon-
nected groups on attributes measured with ordinal or dichot-
omous variables. It brings the modelling of homophily into
the overall family of log-linear models, whose statistical
properties are well-known and whose parameterizations are
extremely flexible and therefore readily adaptable to the
testing of specific hypotheses. In order to apply the log-
linear model to data on group memberships, the list of the
members of each group must first be converted to a cross-
tabulation of dyadic relationships, following the method of
Stegbauer and Rausch (2012). Examples of the use of the
log-linear distance model to assess age and gender homoph-
ily in co-offending groups are provided in recent work by
Carrington (2015a, 2015b).

Notes
 1. Members of minority groups will also be more likely to select
members of majority groups, creating observed heterophily,

years-of-age, based on co-offending patterns.

but this will be less than the homophilous selections of the
majority.
2. Although it can be consequential. For example, baseline
homophily and the numerical predominance of `Anglos' in
the American population account for the more `racially homo-
geneous' social networks of American Anglos (McPherson et
al., 2001: 420). Also, a `highly skewed' proportion of one
type of person ­ such as males in the legitimate or criminal
workplace ­ can lead to a (psychological) preference among
that type for homophily and can create local social structures
that promote homophily among members of that type (Kanter,
1977; McPherson et al., 2001; Steffensmeier, 1983).
 3. Or the intercept may be omitted, in which case the overall fre-
quency is incorporated into the row and column parameters.
 4. In the general log-linear model of a two-way table, the row and
column variables may be distinct (i.e. the table may be rectan-
gular), so the parameter for the column variable is designated

j
Y (Agresti, 2013: 340), but the distance model is applied to
a square table in which the rows and columns refer to the same
variable.
5. Haberman (1974) terms this the `fixed distance' model, to
distinguish it from the `variable distance' model, in which
the effect of the difference between categories is allowed to
vary (formula (4) below). For an example of that model, see
Carrington (2015b).
6. In principle, a higher dimensional cross-tabulation could be
used to capture interactions among more than two actors and
a corresponding log-linear model to model homophily; how-
ever, the author is unaware of any such work.
 7. This is the same as the distance model (formula (2)), except
the distance (heterophily) parameter is omitted so that any
homophily will appear in the residuals.

10. As Carrington (2015a) points out, these are practically the
same groupings of ages that were arrived at by Carrington
(2015b), using a different conceptualisation of `age group' and
correspondingly different methods.
