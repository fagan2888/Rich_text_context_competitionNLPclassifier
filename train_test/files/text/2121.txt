How Much Time Do Adults Spend on
Health-related Self-care? Results from the American
Time Use Survey
Daniel E. Jonas, MD, MPH, Yoko Ibuka, PhD, and Louise B. Russell, PhD
Background: The amount of time individuals spend on health-related self-care is not known.
Objective: The aim of this study was to describe how much time American adults reported spending
on health-related self-care (eg, taking insulin, dressing a wound).
Methods: We analyzed data from the first 5 years, 2003 to 2007, of the population-based American
Time Use Survey. Of 64,310 respondents 25 years of age and older, 4267 reported 7022 episodes of
health-related self-care on their survey day. We used descriptive statistics, weighted to represent US
adults, to describe self-reported time and logit regressions to analyze the odds of engaging in self-care
as a function of age, sex, race, and other characteristics. Because health status was collected only in
2006 to 2007, analyses were conducted separately for 2003 to 2007 and 2006 to 2007.
Results: Of Americans 25 years of age and older, 6.6% engaged in health-related self-care each day.
Among those reporting self-care, mean time reported was 90 minutes (median, 15 minutes); 20.6% re-
ported 2 hours or more. Regressions for 2006 to 2007 show that people aged 75 or older were 3.9
times as likely (95% CI, 2.7­5.8) to report self-care as persons aged 25 to 44. Compared with persons
in excellent health, those in fair health were 2.0 times as likely (95% CI, 1.4­2.8) and those in poor
health were 3.7 times as likely (95% CI, 2.5­5.6) to report engaging in self-care. Nonworking disabled
persons reported self-care 4 times (95% CI, 3.1­5.3) as often as employed persons. Sex, race/ethnicity,
presence of children, and body mass index were also significant.
Conclusions: Time spent on health-related self-care is disproportionately distributed across the
population, with a larger amount of time reported by those in poor health (3.6 hours/week) and the
nonworking disabled (3.2 hours/week). To provide patient-centered care and to promote optimal deci-
sions about health-related time management when making recommendations for additional self-care
tasks, clinicians need to talk to patients about how much time they are already spending on
self-care.(J Am Board Fam Med 2011;24:380­390.)

Self-care, or self-management, is an integral part of
the management of chronic diseases such as asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure,
and diabetes. For some conditions, the majority of care
is implemented day to day by patients, with physicians
offering intermittent instruction.1,2 Appropriate self-
care can require considerable time and likely varies by
condition and severity. For example, adult patients with
cystic fibrosis devote almost 2 hours daily to self-care,3
and estimates suggest that recommended diabetes self-
care requires more than 2 hours daily.4
Self-care has been defined as "the personal and
medical care performed by the patient, usually in
collaboration with and after instruction by a health
care professional."5 The time required for self-care
(eg, taking insulin, dressing a wound) for most
health conditions is not known, nor is the total time
that individuals spend on self-care. Understanding

the amount of time patients spend on self-care is
important for several reasons. First, self-care is es-
sential for optimal health. Second, the amount of
time required for self-care tasks could be a very
important factor in patient-centered decision mak-
ing. Knowing what people currently choose to do
seems an essential first step toward achieving opti-
mal "health time" management. When patients
have competing demands and only a set amount of
time to devote to self-care, but there are hours of
options, what should they prioritize? If time re-
quirements are burdensome, clinicians may need to
help patients set priorities to maximize health. Third,
the time required may for some patients be a substan-
tial barrier to compliance with self-care regimens.
Several authors have explained that time require-
ments are barriers to self-care or health care more
generally.3,6­9 One study found that more than 20%
of patients identified "not enough time" as the biggest
obstacle to effectively managing their diabetes.8
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), from
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the first
large-scale ongoing survey of time use in the
United States. The ATUS interviews a nationally
representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults
about their activities during a 24-hour period. De-
tailed activity codes make it possible to identify
time spent on personal health-related self-care for
existing conditions, which is coded separately from
time spent on primary prevention activities like
physical activity. The purpose of this article is to
describe the time American adults 25 years of age
and older spend on health-related self-care using
data from the survey's first 5 years (2003­2007).
Methods
American Time Use Survey
Conducted for the BLS by the Census Bureau, the
ATUS began in January 2003.10 Households are
selected from those that have completed their last
interview for the Current Population Survey
(CPS), the nation's monthly labor force survey.11
Thus, the ATUS, like the CPS, is based on a
nationally representative sample of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized US population. The process of
selecting the ATUS sample begins by subsampling
the CPS to reduce the oversample of less-populous
states because accurate estimates by state, which are
required for the CPS, are not necessary for the
ATUS. Households are then stratified on race and
Hispanic origin, presence and age of children, and,
for childless households, the number of adults; mi-
nority households and households with children are
sampled at higher rates than other households. Fi-
nally, one respondent at least 15 years old is ran-
domly selected from the members of each sample
household. Approximately 40,000 households were
selected in 2003 and approximately 26,000 per year
from 2004 through 2007, with equal numbers se-
lected each month throughout the year. Response
rates ranged from 52.5% (2007) to 57.8% (2003).
At our institutions, institutional review board ap-
proval was not necessary for this study because the
de-identified data are publicly available.
Each monthly sample is divided into 4 parts, one
for each week of the month. Within a week, 10% of
the sample is assigned to each weekday and 25% to
each weekend day. BLS weights adjust for the over-
sampling of weekend days as well as for stratifica-
tion and nonresponse.11
The survey is conducted using computer-assisted
telephone interviewing (see Appendix 1, available online
at http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/research_programs/
evidencebased_practice/publications/index.htm). Re-
spondents are randomly assigned a day of the week
and called the following day. During the interview,
they are asked how they spent the 24 hours, begin-
ning at 4 am the day before the call and ending 4 am
the day of the call. For activities other than per-
sonal care, they are asked where they were and who
was in the room or accompanied them. When re-
spondents report 2 or more activities for the same
time, they are asked to specify which was primary;
except for childcare, interviewers do not ask about
secondary activities. For respondents who are not
reached on the first try, interviewers attempt sub-
sequent contacts on the same day of the week for up
to 8 consecutive weeks. Respondents in households
that do not provide telephone numbers (5% of the
sample) are requested, by mail, to call the telephone
center to complete the interview. Interviews with
these respondents take place by telephone and
cover the previous 24 hours, just as with other
respondents. Respondents are interviewed only
once; there is no longitudinal component.
ATUS's telephone interview is conducted as a
conversation (see Appendix 1). Except for 12 com-
mon activities listed on the form, such as sleeping
and eating/drinking, activities are not coded during
the interview but are entered in the respondent's
own words. The interviewer "walks" the respon-
doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2011.04.100260 Time Spent for Health-related Self-care 381
dent through his or her day, essentially asking,
"...and what did you do next?" The coding of
activities takes place only after the interview is
finished. The interview asks about the day before
the interview and has no longitudinal component,
with one exception: a summary question about time
spent away from home for 2 or more nights during
the previous month.
After the interview is complete, 2 other inter-
viewers/coders, working separately, assign codes to
the activities reported. Each activity is assigned a
6-digit code. The first 2 digits indicate one of 17
major activity categories, the second 2 digits indi-
cate an intermediate category, and the final 2 digits
indicate the specific activity.12 We report data for
health-related self care (code 010301), which is
under "personal care,"01 subcategory health-related
self-care.03 Health-related self-care also includes a
separate code for "self-care, not elsewhere classi-
fied" (010399), a specific activity that only includes
"feeling sick." We omitted this category because we
were interested only in active self-care. Examples of
personal health-related self-care are provided in
Table 1.
The definition of health-related self care in the
ATUS seems to be conservative (see Appendix 1).
As noted, what is categorized as health-related self-
care is determined after the interview by 2 coders
who did not conduct the interview. Routine self-
care, like toothbrushing or food preparation, is
explicitly described by other codes. Exercise is in-
cluded under health-related self-care only if done
for medical reasons; otherwise it is coded under
major category 13 ("sports, exercise, and recre-
ation"), which includes exercise for leisure or for
primary prevention. Health-related self-care sec-
ondary to another activity is noted if mentioned by
the respondent but is not coded.
Demographic and other characteristics of respon-
dents came from the ATUS survey and from the
CPS. Neither the 2003 to 2005 ATUS nor the CPS
asked about health conditions, but, in 2006 and 2007,
the ATUS asked respondents their self-rated health,
height, and weight as part of an Eating and Health
module added by the Department of Agriculture.
Data Analysis
To focus on adults, and to avoid problems with
predictors like education, which do not represent
socioeconomic status well for adolescents and
young adults, we omitted respondents younger
than age 25. We used the weights BLS provides for
combining survey years to adjust for oversampling
in some subpopulations, days of the week, and
nonresponse to make national estimates.13 Unless
stated, numbers are weighted.
Our initial analysis focused on descriptive statis-
tics. We compared the full ATUS sample 25 years
of age or older with respondents who reported
health-related self-care for 2003 to 2007; the 2006
to 2007 sample was compared separately because
these were the years when self-rated health and
body mass index (BMI) were available. To explore
the factors related to whether patients reported
time on health-related self-care, we ran multivari-
able logistic regressions using a binary dependent
variable (any time vs no time spent). We included
the following predictors: age; sex; race/ethnicity
(white non-Hispanic, black, Hispanic, other); edu-
cation; employment status; household income;
marital status; and presence of children. We re-
peated the analysis for 2006 to 2007 with the same
predictors, plus BMI and self-rated health, which
were only available for those years. We conducted ad-

age group (ages 25­44, 45­64, 65­74, and 75; see
Appendix 2, available online at http://www.shepscenter.
unc.edu/research_programs/evidencebased_practice/
publications/index.htm).
Reported time for health-related self-care, in min-
utes per day, was described by means, medians, and
ranges. The ATUS sample weights adjusted for strat-
ification and nonresponse so that time estimates rep-
resent the national population of adults. The ATUS's
successive difference replicate weights were used to
obtain standard errors that adjust for the complex
survey design.
We calculated yearly time for the average adult,
and the average member of subgroups, eg, those
with poor self-rated health, by multiplying mean
daily time for the group (proportion who reported
self-care time multiplied by mean time spent by
those who reported time) by 365 days. We calcu-
lated weekly time by multiplying daily time by 7.
Although any one individual's self-care time varies
from day to day, these extrapolations of daily time
are valid because respondents who report self care
on their interview day but do not engage in it on
other days are balanced by respondents who do not
report self-care on their interview day but do en-
gage in it on other days. The proportions of par-
ticipants who do and do not report self care on their
interview days, and the times they report, are rep-
resentative of the adult population. The ATUS
thus provides an accurate snapshot of time spent by
the average adult each day and can legitimately be
extrapolated to a week or a year.
Analyses were conducted using SAS software ver-
sion 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) or Stata
software, version 11 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX). Stata 11's survey procedures were used to
adjust for complex sample design using successive
difference replicate weights provided by BLS.
Results
Over the survey years 2003 to 2007 there were
64,310 ATUS respondents aged 25 years or older
(Table 2). Of these, 4267 reported time for 7022
episodes of health-related self-care. Compared
with all respondents, those reporting self-care were
more likely to be older than 75 years (23.2% vs
8.9%; P  .001); women (67.1% vs 57.2%; P 
.001); childless (79.2% vs 55.2%; P  .001); retired
(41.6% vs 19.0%; P  .001); not in the labor
force/disabled (21.6% vs 5.0%; P  0.001); or have
annual household incomes less than $15,000
(27.4% vs 11.8%; P  .001). Respondents report-
ing self-care in 2006 to 2007 were similar to those
reporting self-care for 2003 to 2007.
Table 3 shows numbers weighted to represent
the population of US adults. Overall, 6.6% of
American adults 25 years of age or older reported
spending time on health-related self-care each day
during the years 2003 to 2007; 6.4% reported time
spent on health-related self-care during the 2 years
for which health data were available (2006 to 2007).
More than 17% of persons aged 75 and older re-
ported self-care time compared with 12% of those
aged 65 to 74 years, 7% of those 45 to 64 years, and
3% of those 25 to 44 years. More than 27% of
those in poor health reported self-care time com-
pared with 3% to 6% for those in good to excellent
health. When respondents reported 2 or more ac-
tivities for the same time (ie, multitasking), only
self-care activities designated as primary by the
respondent are coded by the ATUS.
In multivariable logistic regression for the full
2003 to 2007 sample, age, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, children, employment status, and income all
influenced the odds of spending any time on self-
care (Table 4). Age was particularly important, with
participants in the older age groups being much
more likely to report time on self-care. Nonwork-
ing disabled persons were more than 7 times as
likely to report time spent on self-care.
When the sample was limited to 2006 to 2007
and self-rated health and BMI were included in the
regression, those with fair self-rated health were
twice as likely, and those with poor self-rated
health were 3.7 times as likely, to spend time on
self-care as those with excellent self-rated health
(Table 4). Those with BMI 35 were 1.7 times as
likely to spend time on self-care as those with a
BMI of 20 to 29.9. Income and education were no
longer significant.
In multivariable logistic regressions stratified by
age group (Appendix 2), BMI was statistically sig-
nificant for people aged 45 to 64 years and 65 to 74
years, but not for the youngest and oldest groups.
There were other minor differences across age
groups; for example, the sex difference seemed to
be greater among persons 25 to 44 years of age than
those in the older groups. The finding that fair or
poor health increases the probability that a person
will report health-related self-care is consistent

across age groups: the odds ratios are all approxi-
mately 2.0 for fair health; for poor health the odds
ratios range from 3.5 to 4.2.
Among those reporting self-care, the mean time
reported was 90 minutes. Half spent 15 minutes or
less (the median), although 20.6% spent 120 minutes
or more (Figure 1). Most people (65.8%) reported
one episode of self-care, but approximately a third
reported 2 or more episodes. More episodes occurred
in the morning between 6 am and 11:59 am than in
any other 6-hour period (39.7% of episodes).
Average weekly time for the entire adult popu-
lation, those who reported self care and those who
did not, was 42 minutes per person, equivalent to
36.2 hours per year (95% CI, 32.8­39.6). Multi-
plying hours per person by the 2005 population
aged 25 years or older, adults spent an estimated
132 million hours on self-care per week, or 6.9
billion hours each year (more than 172 million
40-hour workweeks).
People with poor health who reported time for
self-care spent a mean 113 minutes daily, and those
who were disabled/not in the labor force reported
99 minutes daily. Averaging over those who re-
ported time and those who did not, people with
poor self-rated health spent a mean 3.6 hours per
person per week (189 hours annually) on health-
related self-care. People who were disabled/not in
the labor force averaged 3.2 hours/week (169 hours
annually), and those 75 years of age and older
averaged 1.3 hours/week (69 hours/year).
Discussion
US adults spend a significant amount of time on
health-related self-care activities: 42 minutes per
week for the average adult and more than 3 hours
per week for the average person with poor self-

rated health. Time spent on health-related self-care
is disproportionately distributed across the popula-
tion, with a small segment of the population ac-
counting for a large proportion of the time. Not
surprisingly, our results support the expectation
that people who have health problems are more
likely to spend time engaging in self-care. A much
larger percentage of those 65 years of age and older
spent time on health-related self-care on any given
day, although the median time spent by those who
spent time was lower than for younger age groups.
That may seem surprising, but it is consistent with
the idea that many are spending time on things as
simple as taking pills, which is less common among
younger people.
To implement patient-centered decision making,
clinicians should consider the time required for self-
care and talk to patients about time demands. Our
data provide a rough estimate of how much time, on
average, various patients spend (eg, 3.6 hours/week
for those with poor health, 3.2 hours/week for people
who are disabled/not in the labor force). Knowing the
starting point for what people currently do seems an
essential first step toward achieving optimal "health
time" management. When weighing various options
for self-care, it may be important to negotiate which
tasks are most important to develop plans that are
tailored to individual patients and set realistic goals
for self-care activities in the time available for each
patient. Some self-care regimens may be too time
consuming or complex for many patients to under-
take without multidisciplinary support.14 Consider-
ation of patient knowledge, health belief models, and
health literacy are also important for understanding

patients' capacity to maintain appropriate self-
care.15,16
Although health outcomes may be improved
with appropriate self-management,3,14,16­42 self-
care requirements may represent a substantial time
investment for some conditions, leading patients to
omit important tasks, depending on their time
trade-off decisions. For example, a survey of diabe-
tes patients found that 38% did not engage in
recommended foot care or physical activity.8 Ap-
proximately one fourth of adult cystic fibrosis pa-
tients report not completing recommended airway
clearance, primarily because they are too busy, they
forget, and because of the complexity of the regi-
men.3 Similar reasons for neglecting self-care have
been reported among children with cystic fibrosis
and asthma,43 as well as adults with diabetes,44 and
suggest that time requirements may have an impor-
tant impact on self-care. People's willingness to
spend time likely depends on the perceived benefits
of that self-care.
Since the emergence of the self-care movement
in the 1970s, the health care system has shifted
toward expecting chronically ill patients to play a
more active role in their care, and time spent on
self-care has likely increased.39 The self-care move-
ment aims to increase patients' involvement in their
own care, especially for chronic conditions, thereby
fostering greater adherence to complex self-care
regimens and improving outcomes.1,39,45
The ATUS data do not allow us to determine
time spent on specific self-care activities or for
specific health conditions. It is unclear how much
of the time is dedicated to chronic disease self-
management (eg, taking insulin or foot care for
diabetes), acute illness self-care (eg, gargling for a
sore throat or icing an injury), or other purposes
such as stress management. In addition, we cannot
determine whether individuals with chronic dis-
eases spend an optimal amount of time (ie, an
amount that is appropriate, adequate, or effective)
on self-care and whether the time should be re-
duced or increased. Nor can we assess time
tradeoffs between alternative self-care activities.
Nonetheless, the ATUS provides a useful starting
point that helps clinicians understand how much
time the average patient spends on health-related
self-care, especially if that patient is in poor health.
Some would argue that self-care should be much
more broadly defined to include general physical ac-
tivity and cooking healthy foods, but our purpose
here is to describe time spent on health-related self-
care without including activities for primary preven-
tion, which we consider a separate issue from time
that patients spend caring for existing health condi-
tions. The time reported for physical activity has been
described previously for the ATUS sample,46 with
sports, exercise, and recreation reported by 17.6% of
respondents (mean for those reporting any time
spent, 114 minutes/day; mean for the average adult,
including those who did and those who did not report
time, 20 minutes/day).
Our study has several limitations. First, the
ATUS relies on self-reported time rather than on
direct observation of activities or completing a di-
ary of activities as they occur, making the time
estimates subject to recall bias. Second, ATUS re-
sponse rates range from 52.5% (2007) to 57.8%
(2003). Participants with the greatest self-care time
requirements may be more likely to respond (eg,
unemployed or retired individuals may be more
likely to be at home to answer the phone) or less
likely to respond (eg, disability or illness may make
it difficult for individuals to answer the phone). In
addition, the ATUS response is limited by (1) non-
response from the CPS and (2) survey fatigue from
the CPS; survey fatigue is a key reason why people
refuse to participate in the ATUS.47 However, the
CPS offers advantages in selecting the ATUS sam-
ple and adjusting for nonresponse because more is
known about the base population. Third, time
spent on health-related self-care as a secondary
behavior (eg, while watching television) is not asked
about, nor is it coded when volunteered (Appendix
1), making our estimates conservative. Fourth, we
cannot determine time spent on specific self-care
activities because the ATUS does not provide that
level of detail; all health-related self-care activities
are grouped under a single code. Finally, because
the ATUS does not collect data on health condi-
tions, we are unable to determine time spent on
self-care by condition, such as diabetes or asthma,
and therefore we cannot determine whether the
amount of time spent is optimal.
Conclusion
Time spent on health-related self-care is dispro-
portionately distributed across the population, with
more time spent reported by those in poor health
(mean, 3.6 hours/week) and the nonworking dis-
abled (mean, 3.2 hours/week). To provide patient-

centered care and to promote optimal decisions
about health-related time management when mak-
ing recommendations for additional self-care tasks,
clinicians need to be aware of the time their pa-
tients are already spending on self-care. The ATUS
provides benchmark data that can help clinicians
identify those patients for whom the burden of
self-care time is likely more substantial. Further
research, including longitudinal studies of self-care
time, is needed to understand the time required for
self-care activities for specific health conditions.
