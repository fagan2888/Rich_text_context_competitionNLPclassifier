Abstract: In this paper we create indices of resilience to identify adolescents at risk of
smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal drugs. Using data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, three manifestations of resilience were
identified: overall-resilience, self/family-resilience, and self-resilience. Our analysis
reveals that the overall-resilient were less likely to engage in risky behaviors. The
self/family resilient were more likely to engage in risky behaviors, but consumed less. The
self-resilient had reduced risk for smoking and drinking alcohol but elevated risk for using
illegal drugs and being in an addictive stage of smoking and drinking, if participating.

1. Introduction
In its report, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance--United States 2005, the CDC asserts that "health-
risk behaviors, which contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and
adults, often are established during childhood and adolescence, extend into adulthood, are interrelated,
and are preventable [1]. Results from the CDC's national Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2005 indicated
that, during the prior 30 days, 23.0% had smoked cigarettes, 43.3% had consumed alcohol, 20.2% had
used marijuana, and 2.1% reported past injection of an illegal drug [1]. Risky behavior among
adolescents has decreased since 1991, but many still engage in behaviors which contravene achieving
the goals of Healthy People 2010 [2]. Those who continue to engage despite policy interventions may
be most at risk for negative outcomes.
The CDC calls for "more effective school health programs and other policy and programmatic
interventions which are needed to reduce risk and improve health outcomes among youth" [1]. While
school health programs may have some impact, it is critical for such programs to target those
adolescents most at-risk. This research seeks to increase the effectiveness and target efficiency of
health policies and programs whose aim is to reduce health-risk behaviors among adolescents, by
exploring the role of resilience in adolescents' risk for participation in these behaviors.
Efforts have been made to identify processes of both vulnerability and protection to reduce health
compromising behaviors in adolescents [3]. Resilience refers to an individual's capacity to engage in
health-promoting behaviors in the face of adversity [4-9] and is an important element in human
adaptation. It is a distinguishing quality necessary for adapting to changing demands of daily living.
Work in psychology [5,7,8,10-12] introduces the notion of resilience to understand coping and
adaptation, which can influence activity preferences, and supports the premise that resilient
adolescents are more able to endure stress and avoid addiction [5,7,8]. Two individuals facing the
same family and social pressures may respond differently based on unobserved attributes like
resilience. Previous literature [5,7,13] has suggested that factors associated with resilience and
vulnerability occur on three levels: personal, family, and community and that each contributes to an
individual's overall resilience. Social supports outside the family contribute to community-level
resilience, family-level resilience is associated with parental function and relationships, and
personal-resilience is associated with the individual's psychological, cognitive, and emotional
processes [5,7,8,13,14]. The indices we construct in this paper capture resilience in these areas. While
an individual's stock of resilience at any given point in time is also a function of these outside
influences (community and family), it is the perception of one's own situation that will ultimately
drive behaviors such as smoking, drinking and drug use. There are three models of resilience in the
literature. In this paper we build on the compensatory model of resilience that posits that the collective
appraisals of risk and compensatory factors predict competence. For example, negative personal self
image (risk factor) combined with a positive perception of peer support, respect and admiration
(compensatory factor) may have a neutralizing effect on an individual's propensity to engage in
unhealthy activities [15-18]. Whether the factor is risky or compensatory is determined by the
individual's own self perception. We construct our index in line with this theoretical framework. The
other two models provide alternative rationale for resilience in adolescents. The protective factor
model identifies social and environmental assets and resources as factors that reduce the degree of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2163
risk [19]. The challenge model [18] focus on risk factors as facilitators of adaptation. Individuals
build on their resilience capacities when confronted with stress that does not exceed their ability
to cope.
Indications of not enjoying life, feeling sad, feeling hopelessness etc., imply lower personal
competence and resilience. Alternatively, feeling one has good qualities and having a sense of
accomplishment and pride are indicators of a healthy sense of personal competence and mastery and,
consequently, of resilience [4,6,20-23]. In this research, we use indicators of these emotional attributes
to construct measures of resilience in adolescents.
An adolescent functions in some dominant culture with customs, practices, ideologies, values,
norms, and beliefs. The social environment, in addition to personal competence, is fundamental to
fostering and exercising resilience, which, in adolescents, may be influenced by adverse
experiences [13,24,25]. The social context might afford opportunities for feeling socially accepted,
loved, and wanted (helping develop an adolescent's resilience), or, conversely, might foster a sense of
vulnerability, hindering development of resilience and resulting in initiation of activities that
compromise health [6].
Adolescents engage in activities that satisfy their physiological and psychological needs and
provide physical and mental comfort and security. The activities chosen (health-promoting or health-
compromising) depend on the contexts in which the individual exists. Regardless of the activities'
benefits or detriments, engagement in these activities is contextually purposeful and meaningful to the
individual [26]. Therefore, an adolescent's overall resilience is not just a function of individual make-
up, but also strongly impacted by social constructs. We also use indicators of an adolescent's
contextual/social attributes in our construction of resilience measures.
Factors such as peer and family influences, school, and policy environment have all proven to be
predictors of early initiation of risky products like cigarettes [27-29], and policies have been enacted to
reduce initiation, but with mixed results. At the margin, most of these policies have had some impact.
The economics literature consistently finds that increased price reduces initiation [30]. However, it
may be that "sin taxes" and advocacy programs have disproportionately provided incentives and
information to deter such behavior among adolescents for whom addiction was an unlikely
outcome [31,32]. To effectively reduce initiation and addiction, current policies may not be optimal
since their focus is on adolescents in general, rather than those with the highest propensity for adverse
outcomes. For example, the D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program, once offered by
75% of American school districts to all adolescents and/or pre-adolescents in certain grades, may be
eliminated by some districts because studies have not demonstrated the program's
effectiveness [33-35]. Some districts are considering replacing D.A.R.E. with alternative programs
which assess "the levels of risk factors related to problem behaviors such as alcohol, tobacco and other
drug use--and to identify the levels of protective factors that help guard against those behaviors" [36].
We suggest that one difficulty in achieving success with existing anti-addiction policy is the lack of
research that identifies at-risk groups. Jessor (1991) believes the aim of research regarding risky
adolescent behavior should be identifying its psychosocial antecedents and determinants, that is,
"What are the risk factors for the risk factors?" [37], and that effective policy in reducing this behavior
must address an adolescent's capacity for coping with life as a factor influencing initiation of risky
behaviors [4,9,20]. Our premise is that the protective factors which contribute to resilience help
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2164
adolescents endure stress and avoid addiction-associated psychosocial impairments [5,7,8]. By
developing resilience indices, we identify an important source of heterogeneity among adolescents in
their propensities to cope, in order to identify those that may be more or less at risk for participating in
health-compromising behavior.
Policy makers need to know who is at risk, the magnitude of that risk, and the factors that drive
risky behavior, to develop target efficient policies aimed at improving outcomes among adolescents.
Considering personal, psychosocial, and environmental factors when developing policy to reduce risky
behavior should enable interventions to reduce participation and improve health more efficiently.
Further, if resilience is a key factor in predicting outcomes, effective policies may attempt to improve
resilience among adolescents, strengthening coping skills and the contextual factors that contribute to
resilience [38]. The three models of resilience in the literature can be used to inform policy. Therefore,
the ability to assess resilience in adolescents might help predict who is at risk for addiction, enabling
addiction prevention policies to be targeted at those adolescents most likely to benefit. Using factor
analysis on data from the nationally representative sample of middle/high school students in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [39] (Add Health), we identified three, mutually-
exclusive manifestations of resilience. Consistent with assumptions and prior literature, these are
related to social, family, and individual resilience [6]. To identify the effect of adolescent resilience on
the risk of engaging in health-compromising behaviors (smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal
drugs) and subsequent addiction, we tested the following hypothesis: Adolescents who are less
resilient will be more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, and use illegal drugs and will consume greater
quantities of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
This study used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [39] (Add Health),
which consists of data on adolescents from 132 schools nationwide, between grades 7 through 12 in
1994. A description of the sample may be found in Table 1. The in-school portion of the first wave of
the survey (1994) contains a cross-section of data on about 90,000 adolescents. A subset of the initial
sample (20,745 respondents) was also interviewed in their homes with follow-up surveys in 1996 and
in 2002. The primary data for our analysis comes from the first wave (1994) of the in-home survey
portion of Add Health. The study benefits from the richness of the Add Health data, both in terms of
sample size as well as the quality of the measures of typically unobserved school, peer, family, and
individual attributes [13]. We capitalize on this strength to identify adolescents at risk. The use of the
restricted secondary Add Health data has been approved by the Carolina Population Center.
The sample for our analysis included the 20,700 in-home sample adolescents who responded to all
relevant questions for this study. Parents of the in-home sample were also interviewed regarding the
parent-child relationship as well as parents' smoking and alcohol consumption. Additionally, school
administrators provided attributes of the school, including anti-smoking, -alcohol, and -drug
policies/prevention programs.

2.2. Construction of Resilience Indices
There were 31 Add Health questions identified as being related to resilience (Table 2). Putting all 31
questions into the model would be noisy and difficult to interpret, particularly because of how collinear
they are. Using exploratory factor analysis, a simple, yet efficient data reduction technique, these 31
questions were reduced to three, mutually-exclusive, underlying, latent indices (factors) [6] which
significantly captured the heterogeneity in the way that resilience is manifested in adolescents. The
methodology combines like underlying components of the 31 questions, and groups them into the three
mutually exclusive indices. This minimizes the potential for attenuation bias that might result from
indicators that may have offsetting effects (the attribute is associated with a good outcome, but may
also have the potential to be associated with a negative outcome). Table 2 contains the factor loadings
and scoring coefficients from the factor analysis that depicts how each indicator can have more than
one non-random significant component that is tied to different underlying attributes of
adolescent resilience.
Factors are typically selected based on the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Some use a cutoff of
eigenvalue = 1 to retain a factor, while others argue that this is arbitrary, and that factors should be
retained until there is a dramatic drop in the eigenvalue [40]. This latter approach is more consistent
with the intent of factor analysis: an exploratory quest for key, underlying commonalities in multiple
indicators. Based on analyzing the factor loadings, we retained a factor as long as it loaded onto at least
one of the 31 questions stronger than the factors that preceded it. Had we used a cutoff of 1, we would
have retained only the first two factors, throwing information
away. The third factor (eigenvalue close to 0.9) had information that appeared to be significant and
which was not contained in the other factors. We felt it preferable to retain a less important factor than
risk throwing away a significant one, especially in light of the fact that the literature suggests that
resilience has three separate aspects related to personal, family, and community [5-7].
Scoring high on Factor 1 (eigenvalue = 3.85, M = 0.248, SD = 0.887) indicated overall-resilience,
with self, family, and peer/community components. Individuals scoring high on this factor averaged
positive responses to most of the 31 questions. Scoring high on Factor 2 (eigenvalue = 1.46,
M = 0.009, SD = 0.782) indicated self/family-resilience without peer/community components. We
interpret strong sense of self from favorable responses to components such as being happy, hopeful,
and optimistic and having good qualities. For this index we also interpret strong sense of family
support because they felt loved, wanted and that their parents care. However, while this group reported
feeling socially accepted and happy, they also were more likely to feel lonely, sad, and that people
were unfriendly. This suggests some strong family ties, and perhaps some good friends, but that they
struggle socially; perhaps these are the type who are part of a smaller group of friends that are not
popular. Scoring high on Factor 3 (eigenvalue = 0.86, M = -0.007, SD = 0.705) indicated self-
resilience without family and peer/community components. We retained this factor because it had the
highest load onto being non-argumentative so it contained information not captured elsewhere.
Respondents scoring high in this factor are a type that are worthy of study. While they report lack of
support from parents and teachers, some of the areas they score high in suggest strength within
themselves. For example these types score high on factors like not being sad, liking oneself, and
confidence going with gut feelings, suggesting strong self in the absence of feeling that adults care
about them. They were also less likely to face their problems--which could be a protective coping
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2167
mechanism that keeps the adolescent optimistic, despite difficult circumstances. This type of
adolescent has chosen to trust and rely on self given lack of alternatives.
If resilience in adolescents occurred such that the manifestation of any type of resilience
(self, family, and/or community) was independent of the manifestation of any other type of resilience,
then we would expect the factor analysis to reveal three distinct components of resilience: self alone,
family alone, and community alone. However, the factor analysis revealed that, in adolescents, the
manifestation of types of resilience is NOT independent, but rather highly correlated. One of the
assumptions of factor analysis is that there is enough independence in the manifestation of distinct
components so that the factor analysis can tease the components apart. Our results suggest that this
assumption that self, family and community resilience are independent is violated. That is why the
factor analysis results indicated three factors that are empirically (that is, based on the data) mutually-
exclusive but not conceptually mutually exclusive, because, for example, clearly overall-resilience
contains elements of family-resilience and self-resilience. The factor analysis did not find three
mutually-exclusive types of resilience, but rather revealed, among adolescents, three mutually-
exclusive manifestations of resilience: overall-resilient, self/family-resilient, or self-resilient. In other
words, the factor analysis reveals three distinct types of adolescents that have some overlapping self-
reported attributes. We can now identify these distinct types of adolescents in our model of behavior to
better identify which types are at risk. A table showing the means and standard deviations for each
sample characteristic (see Table 1 for a list of characteristics) for each of the three resilience factors
(overall, self/family, and self) is available from the authors on request.

2.3. Constructing Participation and Consumption Indicators
Variables: Dependent variables included participation and consumption (smoking, drinking, or
using illegal drugs). Independent variables included resilience, other personal factors, family relations,
peer behavior [41,42], and school policies. Confounding variables included parental education, and
whether or not the adolescent lived with both biological parents, in an urban setting, at least one parent
smoked, the parents consumed alcohol, and the adolescent indicated easy access to cigarettes at home.
Smoking was classified into four levels: non- (never, ever tried cigarettes), experimental- (tried
cigarettes, denied smoking within the past 30 days, never smoked regularly), intermittent- (smoked
between 1 and 29 of the past 30 days), or regular-smoker (smoked on a daily basis the past
30 days) [43,44], with the latter three groups classified as participating. Consumption was the number
of cigarettes smoked each day that the person smoked. Drinking was classified into three levels: non-
(never drank alcohol), light/moderate- (having one to four drinks each time), or heavy-drinker (having
five or more drinks each time), with the latter two groups classified as participating. Drinking
consumption was the number of drinks the adolescent had each time they drank alcohol. Illegal drug
use was classified into two levels with those who reported to have tried any illegal drugs in the
previous 30 days categorized as participating and consumption was measured by number of times
drugs were used in the last 30 days.
A variable was constructed, using exploratory factor analysis, to capture both the child's and
parent's perception of the parent-child relationship, to reflect roles that parents play in influencing
adolescents' risky behavior [45]. Adolescents contributed perceptions of whether he/she thought that
his/her parents care, understand, pay attention, etc. and parents contributed perceptions of whether
he/she got along well with the child, could trust the child, etc. The factor analysis results indicated that
a single factor (eigenvalue = 2.25837) was sufficient to summarize all variables in the parent-child
relationship.
The average number of students in the respondent's grade and school who smoked, consumed
alcohol, or used illegal drugs was used to identify peer influence. To account for various school
policies, models used school program indictors (whether the school offered alcohol, drug, and/or
smoking prevention/awareness programs) and school restriction indictors (whether smoking was
prohibited for students and faculty on the school premises and/or whether possession of drugs and/or
alcohol resulted in suspension from school).
Data Analysis: Since the participation variables were binary (adolescents either participated or they
did not participate), probit analysis was used to build three participation models for smoking, drinking,
and using illegal drugs. Ordinary least-squares multiple regression was used to build three
consumption models: quantity of cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs. Besides controlling for
observed environmental factors, we also controlled for unobserved differences within neighborhoods
by introducing school-level variables (fixed effects) in all of our estimations. This allowed us to
account for environmental differences at the school level that might have influenced resiliency at the
individual level.

3. Results
The results of our analyses of the influence of resilience on risky behavior are reported in Table 3.
The effect of resilience persisted even after controlling for family, peer, and other environmental and
personal factors. For each behavior (smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illegal drugs) we report the
difference in the probability of participating (columns 1, 9 and 17) from the average probability (for a
marginal increase in the resilience index or other variable) and then, for those who do participate, the
incremental amount consumed (columns 5, 13 and 21). We modeled consumption thus to understand
severity of the behavior among those who chose to participate. (Overall consumption results, which are
similar to these, are also available, upon request.)
A one unit increase in the overall-resilience index reduces the probability of smoking by almost 5%,
by 6% for drinking, and by 4% for illegal drug use. Those who were self/family-resilient but perhaps
are weaker in social resilience were at a higher risk for participation. Individuals who score marginally
higher in this index are 6­7% more likely to smoke or drink and 2% more likely to use illegal drugs
than the average. Those who were self-resilient were marginally less likely to smoke or drink, but 1%
more likely to use illegal drugs.
For consumption (conditional on participation), those who were overall-resilient consumed less
alcohol and cigarettes with no difference in illegal drug consumption. Those who were self-resilient
consumed more cigarettes, while those who were self/family-resilient smoked fewer cigarettes.
Drinkers who were self-resilient consumed above average quantities of alcohol. Among drug users
(smallest sample), there was no difference in consumption by resilience.
The confounding factors were also significant in predictable ways for both participation and
consumption. The role of parents was especially important with parental education and participation in
risky behaviors, as well as the relationship with the child, all being significant factors. After
controlling for resilience, older adolescents, males, whites, and Hispanics were more likely to engage
in risky behavior. Religious adolescents were less likely to do so.
4. Discussion
The literature suggests three components of resilience (personal, family, and community) [8-11].
The data confirm three significant underlying components, with the bulk of what determines resilience
captured by the first factor. However, two other factors, with sufficiently high eigenvalues and factor
loadings, indicated residual commonalities worth including beyond the first resilience index. It was
predicted that adolescents with high scores on these three factors had greater resilience and, in turn,
would exhibit better outcomes than those with low scores, after controlling for other risk factors.
The results (see Table 3) indicate that self/family-resilience, in the absence of peer/community
resilience, was inadequate to prevent participation in risky behaviors (Risk factors - smoking, drinking,
and using drugs). Perhaps those who experience an absence of peer acceptance (compensatory factors)
may be unable to resist risky behaviors due to peer pressure to "fit in." However, strong self/family-
resilience can lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. These may be the experimenters
or intermittent participants who smoke when out socially but with strong enough family support and
self resilience to know when to stop. Alternatively, those who were overall-resilient may be better
equipped to resist peer pressure to smoke, drink, or use drugs. Interestingly, those who were
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 2171
self-resilient, with little family or social support, were less likely to smoke or drink but those who
did consumed larger quantities. In a model where we control for other risk factors like family
characteristics, strong self resilience (coping skills) predictably reduces propensities to engage in such
behaviors. There does appear to be a split among adolescents who fall into this resilience type since
those who do participate are the target group at highest risk for addiction since among those who do
participate, they are consuming closer to addictive levels. In addition, within this type are those who
are more likely to turn to illegal drug use rather than face problems.
In sum, perhaps smokers who were overall-resilient were primarily experimental, smokers who
were self/family-resilient were primarily experimental or intermittent (mainly to fit in socially), while
smokers who were self-resilient were primarily regular smokers who may smoke as an escape, rather
than for social acceptance. While those who were self-resilient consumed an average amount of drugs,
they were more likely to use drugs, and any use of illegal drugs could be seeking an escape. These
associations between resilience and consumption are particularly noteworthy because the consumption
models contained only participants, who were more homogeneous in resilience and other risk factors,
since these factors already significantly explained the propensity to participate.
Programs like the DARE program may have had little impact because they are not target
efficient [27-29]. This work has implications for policies aimed at improving outcomes for adolescents
at risk of engaging in the health compromising activities. School wide programs that are "one size fits
all" may not yield desirable results without attempting to tailor the program to include incentives that
will work for adolescents at risk. An alternative approach might be to identify at risk children in
schools based on resilience scores and develop programs to increase self efficacy and compensate for
lack of environmental assets and resources. Occupational therapists provide interventions in mental
health and school-based settings that assist clients in developing compensatory strategies for building
resilience and facilitating healthy adaptation. In school-based practice, occupational therapy can
provide target specific interventions that meet the specific needs of at risk children and promote
resilience [46].
One limitation of this study is that the Add Health data was not designed with the intent to construct
indicators of resilience. So while the data are rich with indicators that overlap those used in the
literature to construct resilience, the questions were not asked in a sequence consistent with how it
might be done in a resilience study, and we had to pool together indicators throughout the
survey piecemeal.

These results motivate further analysis of the relationships between adolescent resilience and
risky behavior. We can further examine consumption findings, to test for level of addiction, such as
whether those who were self-resilient were more likely to be regular smokers while those who were
self/family-resilient were more likely to smoke intermittently. We also plan to further explore the
psychometric properties of these resilience indices, comparing them to another measure of resilience
and measures of related constructs (in another sample of adolescents) to assess concurrent and
discriminant validity. Future research will also examine how resilience evolves over time and how this
change affects addictive behavior. Data from future waves of Add Health (1996 and 2002) will be
analyzed to further assess how adolescent resilience affects behavior throughout adult life. Also,
interventions should be tested which are targeted toward vulnerable adolescents, engaging them in
experiential learning and problem-solving to increase resilience and health-promoting behaviors when
available personal, family, and peer/community resources are insufficient [47,48].
In conclusion, we hypothesized that adolescents vary in resilience and using a nationally
representative sample of middle/high school students, we examined the role of individual resilience in
predicting addictive behaviors: smoking, alcohol consumption, and illegal drug use. Examining
addictive behavior in adolescents, controlling for confounding environmental and personal factors, the
role of resilience was robust to various model specifications and significantly explains heterogeneous
risks. We suggest that an adolescent's propensity for detrimental risky behavior, and subsequent
negative outcomes, relates to environmental and personal factors, including resilience. The value of
knowing that resilience among adolescents tends to occur in one of three types: overall-resilient,
self/family-resilient, or self-resilient, is that programs to reduce health-compromising behaviors can be
more effective and efficient if they are targeted to adolescents with specific needs, which can be
identified by their type of resilience.
