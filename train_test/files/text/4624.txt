Introduction
Traditionally, understandings of chronic illnesses such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been dominated by a singular
focus on physical symptomology and treatment options
(Harrison, 2003; Reinseth & Espnes, 2007). In the early
1970s and 1980s, medical sociologists such as Friedson
(1970) and Bury (1982) challenged this biomedical focus,
asserting the need to understand chronic illness as both an
embodied and lived experience. Theories of embodiment and
lived experience conceptualize the individual with RA as an
active agent who routinely makes sense of themselves and
their condition within the context of their everyday lives
(Burr, 2003). This engagement with the subjective disrupts
the "objective medical gaze" and repositions the individual
as a key "player" in the meaningful renegotiation of "who
they are" and "what they do"(Christiansen, 1999; G.
Williams, 1984). Within this framing, the individual with RA
is no longer subsumed by the physical impairment (Goodley,
2012).
Drawing on disability studies and its intersections with
postmodernism, allied health professionals and social
researchers influenced by this philosophical shift have reori-
ented their practice from an understanding of the body as
impaired, to that of the body as "irreducible to impairment"
(Hall, 2011, p. 1). This critical understanding challenges the
focus on the "disabled body" and instead (re)presents dis-
ability as "the space from which to think through a host of
political, theoretical and practical issues that are relevant to
all" (Goodley, 2012, p. 632). In practice, it means adopting a
person-centered approach in which the client's voice and
experience is privileged (Alsaker & Josephsson, 2003;
MacDonald, 2008). The emphasis on the "client's" voice
resonates with postmodernism's valuing of both "situated"
(Haraway, 1988) and subjective knowing (Trevithick, 2008)
vital to personal empowerment. This situated knowing is
also, as MacDonald (2008) suggests, integral to the collec-
tive empowerment of people living with chronic illnesses
such as RA and the understandings of the broader commu-
nity; the "experiences/stories of people with (dis)Abilities
and sufferers of chronic pain need to be welcomed into the
discourse on chronic pain, a discourse that has been predom-
inately occupied by biomedicine" (p. 138).
Within this broader framing, allied health professionals
relinquish traditional concepts of adaptation and adjustment
which draw on normative assumptions of disability and ability.
Within a multifaceted understanding of RA, the professional­
client relationship is informed by and "adapted to the everyday
realities of individual's lives" (Plach, Stevens, & Moss, 2004,
p. 138). The health professional's role is primarily one of

Abstract
This article presents the findings from a qualitative research project exploring eight women's experiences of living with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Through semistructured interviews, the women provided insights into the physical, emotional, and
social impacts of RA and the "work" involved in negotiating its influence in the everyday life. In narrating their experiences
of adapting to RA, the women express a common desire for "normalcy," to return to a time and space before the disruption
of RA. The women's accounts also emphasized the interrelatedness between bodily experience and constructions of self,
highlighting the corporeal nature of RA and the constant shaping and reshaping of personal meanings and values.

actively supporting the individual's process of rethinking taken
for granted assumptions and behaviors and reattributing mean-
ing to everyday activities and roles (Hyden, 1997; Nyman &
Lund, 2007). In this process, professional skills are used to
"reframe the sufferer's [sic] situation, to reduce self-blame,
validate the sufferer, provide a critical lens to their . . . experi-
ences" (MacDonald, 2008, p. 138). Integral to the rethinking
and reframing of lived experience is a corresponding need to
engage with the socio-emotional experiences of living with
RA. However, as consumer research consistently reports, spe-
cialist wait times in combination with the short duration of
appointments mean that "there was never the time to talk about
anything other than the physical symptoms" (Brand, Claydon-
Platt, McColl, & Bucknall, 2010, p. 79). As Brand etal. (2010)
report, "Important topics that caused anxiety, such as the long-
term impact of RA and prognosis, were reported to be inade-
quately discussed" (p. 79).
Engaging with the theory and practice of these under-
standings within the context of this study allows for a new
exploration of the everyday negotiations and adaptations of
eight women living with early-diagnosed RA. The women's
accounts provide a nuanced understanding of RA and its dis-
ruptive effects within their physical, emotional, and social
lives. The emphasis on "normalcy," the impact of uncer-
tainty, the focus on the body, and the contentions relating to
adaption and adaptation provide examples of the multifac-
eted approach taken by the women to remake themselves. In
describing these processes, the women narrate their social
and emotional experiences of "adapting" to RA, their nego-
tiations of the negative thoughts threatening to overwhelm,
and the energy required to "keep positive." The women's
accounts are also a reminder of the deeply felt impacts of RA
making it a "less `liveable' condition" than other chronic ill-
nesses (Wiener, 1975, p. 98).
Literature Review
Clinical Description
RA is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 0.5% to 1.0%
of adults in developed countries and is three times more fre-
quent in women than men (Scott, Wolfe, & Huizinga, 2010).
Prevalence rises with age and is highest in women older than
65 years, suggesting hormonal factors could play a role
(Scott et
al., 2010). The prevalence for Sweden is 0.8%
(Neovius, Simard, Askling, & ARTIS Study Group, 2011).
Patients are diagnosed across all ages and the mean inci-
dence ages vary between 56 and 58 years (Thyberg,
Dahlström, Björk, Arvidsson, & Thyberg, 2012; Verstappen
& Symmons, 2011). The introduction and use of pharmaco-
logical treatments in the early stages of the condition in com-
bination with new biological drugs have led to reduced
disease activity and less disability (Scott etal., 2010; Sverker
etal., 2015). However, RA is still associated with disabilities
and reduced quality of life (Söderlin, Lindroth, & Jacobsson,
2010; Sokka etal., 2009; Thyberg etal., 2012; Ziegler etal.,
2010). Women in particular are identified as experiencing
higher disease activity and pain and more difficulties in per-
forming daily activities than their male counterparts
(Ahistrand, Bjork, Thyberg, Borsbo, & Falkmer, 2012;
Sokka etal., 2009).
Chronic Illness as Disruption
In his research exploring people's experiences of RA, Bury
(1982) makes the following statement: "My contention is
that illness, and especially chronic illness, is precisely that
kind of experience where the structures of everyday life and
the forms of knowledge which underpin them are disrupted"
(p. 169). This notion of disruption is emphasized in Scambler
and Scambler (2010) who interpreted chronic illnesses as
"assaults on the lifeworld." As an assault, chronic illness is a
jarring intrusion within the context of people's private and
public lives, it is uninvited and unwelcome (Nyman & Lund,
2007). The presumed assumptions that assist in directing
everyday life to ensure that it is predictable and certain are no
longer appropriate, relevant, or useful (S. Williams, 2000).
The tacit knowledge that allowed mastery within the every-
day life is suddenly irrelevant and meaningless (Bury, 1982;
S. Williams, 2000). Activities, roles, and functions that struc-
tured everyday life and shaped people's perceptions of them-
selves and their relationships with others were in disarray
(Iaquinta & Larrabee, 2004). The disruption to the perfor-
mance of activities done routinely could engender feelings of
anger, fear, frustration, self-consciousness, and depression
(Alsaker & Josephsson, 2003). While such emotions can be
"healthy" within processes of renegotiation, longer term
experiences are generally detrimental to the person's self-
concept and relationships with others (Iaquinta & Larrabee,
2004, p. 283).
Uncertainty
Uncertainty and unpredictability are common features in the
experience of chronic conditions such as RA. While uncer-
tainty is often referred to in the context of the physiological
manifestations of RA, its definition and implications are far
wider. As is documented across the research literature on
RA, uncertainty plays a key role in shaping a person's every-
day understandings and experiences (Bury, 1982; Flurey
et
al., 2014; Lööf, Johansson, Henriksson, Lindblad, &
Bullington, 2014; Strauss etal., 1984; Wiener, 1975).
Published in the mid-1970s, research by Wiener (1975)
provides an introduction to the uncertain realities of people
living with RA. Wiener's research linked uncertainty to
social and psychological well-being and described the psy-
cho-social strategies people adopted "when uncertainty is
exaggerated beyond the usual level of toleration" (p. 97).
Wiener locates uncertainty as inherent within the physiologi-
cal impacts brought on by RA, including flares, and the
Barns et al. 3
general interruption/disruption to everyday life. Coventry,
Dickens, and Todd (2014) also highlight the pervasiveness of
uncertainty in the RA experience describing their research
participants as living "in a perpetual state of uncertainty"
(p. 113). Strauss etal. (1984) identify uncertainty as a power-
ful mediator of people's constructions of an embodied self.
Uncertainty could engender a range of emotional and psy-
chological responses including feelings of fear, dread, and
frustration (Coventry etal., 2014); anger and helplessness
(Lööf etal., 2014); and outcomes of depression and anxiety
(Flurey etal., 2014). For Wiener's participants (and as is rec-
ognized in more recent research), a return to "normal" life
and functioning underpins the strategies they developed and
adopted; "success" is achieved when a person feels they can
"tolerate" the uncertainty and unpredictability of RA on any
particular day or hour.
Bodily Experience
Within disability studies, "the body" has been and continues
to be constructed and reconstructed according to shifts in dis-
course and power. Goodley's (2012) overview of disability
studies draws attention to the "role" of the body within con-
ceptualizations of impairment and disability. Traditional
framings of the body as a site of impairment were challenged
by sociological analyses in which "having an impaired body
did not equate with disability" (Goodley, 2012, p. 634). This
separation between the biological (physical) and the social
was problematized by people whose lived experience of
impairment--the physical and/or biological constraints--
shaped and informed the meanings they made of themselves
and their lives (Crow, 1996; Wendell, 1996). While advo-
cates of feminist disability studies supported the notion that
the "impaired body had been neglected" (Crow, 1996;
Meekosha & Shuttleworth, 2009, p. 59), their interpretation
of impairment moved from "specific forms, functions and
behaviours" to an engagement with corporeality and the
"intricate relation between bodies and selves" (Garland-
Thomson, 2005, p. 1557). In this vein, contemporary femi-
nist disability activists including Inckle (2014) engage with
the notion of "disabled embodiment": "a dynamic, lived
position that intersects mind, body, emotion, social, self and
other, and operationalises new and challenging forms of rep-
resentation and articulation" (p. 389). Both corporeality and
embodiment speak to the complex realities of many women
living with chronic illness such as RA, whose social and
emotional well-being alongside their personal and public
selves are routinely shaped by the physicality of their condi-
tion (Ahistrand etal., 2012; Dubouloz, Laporte, Hall, Ashe,
& Smith, 2004; Plach etal., 2004).
The notions of embodiment and corporeality also
acknowledge the body as gendered. For feminist disability
advocates, this facilitates the "interrogation" of patriarchal
scripts of femininity and in particular, constructions of the
"ideal female body" (Inckle, 2014). As is clearly identified
within feminist disability studies, women with a disability
are not immune to these dominant constructions and the
broader discourse relating to what Garland-Thomson (2005)
describes as the "politics of appearance" (p. 1559). The rigid
descriptions of how and what women "should be" reinforce
the traditional binaries between the normal/abnormal, abled/
disabled, and desirable/undesirable. As Peuravaara (2013)
explains, "Conceptions of bodily normality constantly exist
as a `measuring stick' . . . as a woman . . . you are never `free
from' images of bodily normality" (p. 412). As Shildrick
(2007, p. 222) asserts, "Corporeal difference" is not part of
the idealized female body, nor is it considered as constitutive
of an active sexual subjectivity. Within these interpretations,
the disfiguring and disabling effects brought on by RA posi-
tion women as the "Other" both in terms of femininity and
sexual agency (Plach et
al., 2004; Shildrick, 2007; S.
Williams, 2000).
Opportunities for Transformation
Opportunities for renegotiating relationships with others or
learning different ways of performing activities can provide
spaces for people with RA to "assess and expand their con-
struction of themselves and their illness and . . . search for
alternate realities" (Kelley & Clifford, 1997, p. 276). This
discovery of other ways of "being in the world" can be
epiphanic leading to what G. Williams (1984) describes as a
process of "narrative reconstruction." This process of re-sto-
rying can be empowering and emancipatory, providing alter-
nate understandings of self and the roles assumed in private
and public life (Plach et
al., 2004). For Dubouloz et
al.'s
(2004) re-storying is an example of the type of transforma-
tive learning, possible for people experiencing chronic ill-
ness. Similar to Carel's (2007) theorization of RA as
transformative, it is proposed that the disruptive nature of
RA within people's everyday performance of activities and
tasks can be mediated by a "transformative" shift in the per-
son's meanings, values, and knowledge. Through a process
of critical reflection, involving the deconstruction and recon-
struction of previous life stories, a new identity can be
formed allowing the person to achieve the balance necessary
for maintaining health and well-being (Carel, 2007; Dubouloz
etal., 2004). It is important, however, to recognize that such
transformations and reconstructions occur within a broader
political and social context.
Negotiating Assumptions Within the Social
Context
The bodily experience or corporeality of RA intersects with
dominant constructions of disability (Thomas, 2007). While
contemporary understandings of disability have challenged
both the primacy and authority of medicalized discourses,
deficit-oriented subjectivities continue to be imposed upon
people living with chronic illness (Goodley, 2012; Snyder &
4 SAGE Open
Mitchell, 2006). Goodley (2012) draws attention to the nar-
ratives "manufactured by charities, science and popular cul-
ture" through which disability is defined as a "personal
tragedy, biological deficiency and psychical trauma" (p. 3).
Within these scripts, the person becomes and/or is consumed
by the physical; meaningful engagement with the broader
social, economic, political, and cultural context is discounted.
According to Goodley, such narratives "dis-locate disabled
people" (italics in original) both in materialist and cultural
terms (p. 3). Snyder and Mitchell (2006) agree, identifying
"social erasure" as a possible outcome of these public narra-
tives; "disabled citizens are forced to exchange their liberty
for necessary (and unnecessary) social supports" (p. 19).
Thomas (2007) concurs, describing the social exclusion and
restrictive citizenship produced through the dominant narra-
tive as "a form of social oppression involving the social
imposition of restrictions on people with impairments and
the socially engendered undermining of psycho-emotional
well-being" (p. 73).
Negotiating the Everyday
Traditional understandings of adaptation emphasize the per-
son's capacity to function and perform activities and roles
within their everyday lives (Reinseth & Espnes, 2007).
Negotiating the challenges of living with RA can be a physi-
cally and emotionally exhausting process whereby function-
ing and performance can become measures of personal
defeat and bodily deficit. Kelly and Field (1996) describe the
impact of such traditional interventions in their narrative
research with people experiencing fibromyalgia: "The symp-
toms have taken over the person's life creating a problem-
saturated life story in which other elements of the life are
ignored" (p. 266).According to research by Schulman-Green
et
al. (2012), narrow conceptualizations of adaptation are
problematic in their focus on the functional and physical
aspects of people's experiences, marginalizing the "impor-
tance of emotional and existential processes, such as recon-
ciling emotions and deriving meaning from the illness
experience" (p. 137). Thus, adaptation becomes a process
which facilitates people's capacities to respond meaningfully
to challenges and achieve a state of well-being through their
everyday activities.
Theoretical Framings, Methodology,
and Methods
This research sought to explore women's experiences of
living with RA, with a particular focus on their engage-
ment with everyday activities and roles. In undertaking
this exploration, the researchers adopted a qualitative
methodology and postmodern framings relating to subjec-
tivity and context. As a condition that predominantly
affects women the researchers were cognizant of the inter-
sections between gendered subjectivities and everyday
practices (Olesen, 2011). The focus on understanding the
subjective experiences of women with RA resonates with
the postmodern framing of the person as an active meaning
maker who, through their interactions with others, rou-
tinely construct and reconstruct understandings of their
self(ves) and their realities (Burr, 2003). These under-
standings are fluid and dynamic, responsive to new infor-
mation and environments. This impermanency produces
the capacity for change: a poignant factor in this study of
women whose everyday lives demanded ongoing change
(Lempp, Scott, & Kingsley, 2006). In exploring women's
lived experiences of RA, the findings of this research con-
tribute to the broader shift in research by documenting the
experiences of the "viewpoint of `insiders' who live with
RA day in and day out over decades of their lives" (Plach
et
al., 2004, p. 138). Within a qualitative approach,
researchers attempt "to make sense of, or to interpret, phe-
nomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them"
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005, p. 3).
Setting
The eight women who participated in this research were
recruited from the prospective multicenter research project
Early Interventions in RA (Swedish acronym TIRA). The
TIRA project aimed to establish clinical routines for early
RA diagnosis and early multiprofessional interventions. A
database for research was also established (Thyberg etal.,
2012; Thyberg, Hass, Nordenskiöld, & Skogh, 2004).
Selection in the broader TIRA-1 cohort was based on gen-
der (being female), age, living with RA, and, for practical
reasons, resident in Linköping, Sweden. For this research
project, a purposive sampling framework was used to iden-
tify potential participants: women who were under the age
of 40 years and living with a diagnosis of RA. From the
TIRA client records, 13 women were identified as potential
participants for the study. An introductory letter that
included participant information was mailed to each of the
potential participants. A follow-up phone call was made 1
week later by the researchers with the aim of responding to
any questions the potential participants might have and to
ascertain participation. Of the 13 women invited to partici-
pate, three women declined citing reasons of being "too
busy" and two were "not having any symptoms." Eight
women agreed to participate in the research. While aware
that eight participants was a small sample, a larger sample
would have required recruiting women from the middle-
age bracket and changing the aim of the study. The local
ethics committees of all the participating units in Linköping,
Västervik, and Norrköping approved the studies prior to
data collection and ethics approval was given (Approval
number 96035), and each of the participants gave their
written informed consent. The interviews were performed
during the women's 5- and 7-year follow-ups in the TIRA
study.

Introducing the Participants
The eight women interviewed for this research were aged
between 24 and 43 years, the median age was 36 years. Table 1
identifies each participant by pseudonym (used in the find-
ings and discussion), alongside her age, employment status,
and family context. All the women were employed full-time,
with one woman on maternity leave. Six of the women iden-
tified that they had partners. At the time of the research, one
woman was pregnant and the remaining seven women had
children aged from babies to teenagers. In the clinical
appointment prior to the interview, the women completed a
disability assessment using the Swedish version of the Health
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and a pain assessment
using the Visual Analogue Scale. The women reported low to
moderate scores for both disability and pain.
Data Collection
In keeping with the qualitative methodology framing the
research, semistructured interviews were undertaken with
eight participants. Constructed as conversations between the
interviewer and participant, the in-depth interviews focused
on exploring the meanings and knowledges made by women
with RA as they negotiated their everyday lives (Fontana,
2001). The use of a conversational approach to interviewing
enables us to " . . . know other people, get to learn about their
experiences, feelings, hopes and the world they live in"
(Kvale, 1996, p. 5). An interview guide (see Table 2) consist-
ing of open-ended questions was developed, drawing on the
literature relating to the lived experience of RA and in keep-
ing with the aims of the study. Through this process, two
groups of questions were developed as a guide for the inter-
views: (a) the meanings women make of their experiences of
living with RA and (b) the ways women negotiated the
everyday realities of living with RA. With an emphasis on
ensuring that the women felt safe and at ease, the interviews
were conducted at either the woman's home or the rheuma-
tology clinic, and at a time that was convenient to each par-
ticipant. The interviews were between 35 and 80 min duration
and were audiotaped.
Interpreting the Interviews
Informed by the postmodern emphasis on "many ways of
knowing" (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005), data analysis was
undertaken by the interviewer-as-researcher through a pro-
cess that "emphasises descriptive nuances, differences and
paradoxes" (Kvale, 1996, p. 226). The audiotaped interviews
were transcribed verbatim and each interview was subject to
several close readings before any formal interpretation com-
menced. These readings facilitated an immersion in the inter-
view data and, as Green et
al. (2007) suggest, "allows a
detailed examination of what is said and stimulates a process
where one begins to `incubate' ideas about the possibilities
of analysis" (p. 547). After these initial readings, each inter-
view was subject to a process which Ely, Vinz, Downing, and
Anzul (1997, p. 206) describe as "sorting and lifting" of
"words, sentences or paragraphs containing aspects related
to each other through their content and context" (Graneheim
& Lundman, 2004, p. 106). The meaning units were then cat-
egorized according to their descriptive content and formed
into themes, overall understandings of a particular issue,
idea, or experience. This interpretive process was repeated,
allowing for the emergence of further similarities, nuances,
divergences, and differences within and beyond these initial
categories (Green etal., 2007).
In acknowledging that qualitative data analysis is an inter-
pretive process whereby researchers construct an interpreta-
tion of what the data may mean, infer, or represent (Denzin
& Lincoln, 2005, p. 3), it is important to ensure the "quality"
or trustworthiness of the material produced through analysis
(Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). During analysis of the units,
themes and categories emerging from the material were dis-
cussed by two other members of the research team as a means
of increasing the credibility and trustworthiness of the mate-
rial (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). The analysis process

Findings
"Being Normal"
The unpredictability of chronic conditions such as RA was
described by the women in this research as one of the more
difficult and frustrating aspects of their experiences. The
continuum of physical symptoms from periods of remission
to the intense pain and incapacity of flares were a persistent
reminder of their disability and a barrier to "being normal."
The seeming randomness of symptoms and the onset of
flares could make it difficult, if not impossible, for the
women to participate in the routines of daily life. As one
women lamented, the "normal" tasks she performed in car-
ing for her family, such as doing the laundry, cleaning the
house, making dinner and taking care of the children after
work, were now both time-consuming and an inefficient use
of her time and energy; "you have to slow down all activities.
If you had been well, it would have been possible to speed it
up" (Kristina) to get things done on time. Plans made ahead
of time could be made redundant by the onset of pain or
fatigue. Similarly, for some of the women, the sudden onset
of symptoms had meant the disappearance of spontaneity
from their lives. In this context, the desire for normalcy, for
"being normal," was identified by some women as both a
"wish" and a strategy for negotiating the impacts of RA.
While the notion of "normal" is contested within the
broad landscape of disability studies, the women's descrip-
tions of "normal" can be interpreted as a metaphor for a time
and space before RA. For some of the women, "being nor-
mal" was related to having control within their daily lives,
the capacity to "do what everyone else does" (Ingrid), and to
return to "business as usual" (Monika). Normal was about
being able to engage with activities and roles previously
taken for granted, from going to the gym and exercising like
other patrons to managing the same assignments as col-
leagues in the workplace.
From listening to the women's accounts, it was clear that
"being normal" was easier to achieve during periods free
from pain and joint stiffness, when the impacts of the condi-
tion were minimized. During these times, it was possible to
engage in everyday activities, roles, and tasks both within the
home and at work, without the need for adaptations, such as,
the use of assistive aids or supports. Achieving normalcy on
a longer term basis however required a more comprehensive
strategy of adjustment. This involved engaging with acces-
sibility and assistive aids and the ongoing evaluation of the
meanings and values of particular activities and roles.
Adaptions for "Being Normal"
For many of the women, "being normal" required that they
learn to minimize the impacts of RA in their everyday lives.
Key to this was the issue of adaptation. Perhaps because of
its centrality, adaptation proved to be a contentious and com-
plex process, embedded within the women's broader under-
standings of what it means to be "normal" and how "normal"
could be achieved. While each of the women had made some
adaptations to the activities and tasks they performed in their
daily lives, the type and form of adaptation made was shaped
by the meanings the women made about RA as a physical,
emotional, and social experience. Adaptations could also be
time specific, adopted within a particular context such as a
flare and then abandoned after the flare had subsided. These
temporary adaptations were key strategies in some of the
women's negotiations of RA, facilitating a return to the "nor-
mal" as soon as was practicable.
Adaptations that could easily be incorporated into a cur-
rent routine were regarded as positive: The women provided
examples of lifting an item using two hands instead of one,
placing heavier objects on a lower shelf in the kitchen, and
performing labor-intensive tasks in stages. Seven of the
women identified using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs (DMARDS) as part of their adaptation to RA. These
medications are identified as "key therapeutic agents, reduce
synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function"
(Scott etal., 2010, p. 1100). Other adaptations identified by
the women related to prevention strategies, such as minimiz-
ing the impact of particular activities on the body. While
acknowledging prevention as an important strategy, one
woman described how difficult it was to think about preven-
tion or as she states, "sparing my body" in pain free times;
The occupational therapist I met told me to avoid carrying heavy
bags and to take the trolley when shopping for groceries, but I'm
the kind of person that takes a basket and fills it up so much that
I (can) barely manage to carry it and then, at that point, I think
it's better for me to use a trolley instead, to save my hands. I try
to remember her advice but, I want to do it myself and I'm too
stubborn in that situation, I think. I don't think that much about
sparing my body. (Monika)
Some adaptations identified by the women were less tan-
gible and involved the reshaping of household roles and
responsibilities for family members, friends, and/or work col-
leagues where these parties had been informed. This was par-
ticularly evident in the women's accounts of flare where
family and friends provided practical support in performing
everyday tasks. In some instances, the need for adaptation led
Barns et al. 7
to role changes within the family, with partners, children, and/
or a parent taking on domestic activities. One woman describes
calling on her mother in negotiating care for her baby;
When my first (child) was a baby was the worst time because
my partner worked nights so my mum had to come home to
change (nappies) at night and things like that. (Anna)
Ambivalence About Adaptation
For some women, adaptation represented a life regulated by
their disability and a threat to "being normal" and how they
conceptualized themselves. These women were ambivalent
about their engagement with assistive aids and adaptation
more broadly. A number of women described being prepared
to negotiate pain and discomfort rather than adapt. One wom-
an's desire to be a "real mum" shaped her attitude toward
adaptation. For this woman, adapting to RA challenged the
authenticity of her role as "mum"; "I want to be a real mum. I
put that before adaption to the disease" (Brigitta). Another
woman described the "informed choice" she made in continu-
ing to ski despite knowing the consequences: "I do what I
think is fun . . . I go skiing a lot . . . I know it (RA) will get
worse in the evenings. I know I will get more pain" (Mikaela).
For some of the women, assistive aids were a symbol of
their disability, an unwelcome reminder of the disabling
impacts of RA and their decreasing physical capacity. While
using assistive aids in the workplace, one woman described
her reluctance to use domestic aids, such as a cheese slicer,
which she identified as reinforcing her "impairment" and
threatening her efforts to be "normal":
In my job I have pencils with a rough grip, but other things feel, no
cheese slicers and things make you feel so handicapped, whereas
in fact you want to try to live as normally as possible. (Kristina)
Some of the women also identified the risks involved
with adaptation. Changes to activities including the way in
which they were performed could change the meaning of the
activity and its significance. One woman describes her pre-
vious participation in taekwondo and aerobics, intensely
physical sports which she can no longer undertake. While
emphasizing the importance of exercise as a way of mediat-
ing her RA, the new activities she had adopted were less
meaningful;
It is good to exercise when you've got rheumatism. You should
exercise every day. You can do activities like walking, cycling,
swimming, but in fact I really find them boring. (Brigitta)
Who Am I?
In their discussions of RA as a lived experience, the women
reflected on how the physical experiences had shaped their
understandings of "self" and of "self in relation to others."
For some of the women, their experience of RA had pro-
foundly altered their sense of self, as one woman comments,
"I'm no longer the kind of person I once was and want to be"
(Brigitta). This powerful statement suggests a clear line being
made between a pre- and post-RA self, possibly extending to
a future self. Other women used specific adjectives to identify
the personal impact of RA, describing themselves as "more
negative" (Eva), "boring" (Brigitta), "more sulky" (Maria),
and "more bad tempered" (Kristina). The use of "more" in the
above phrases again reflects the notion of a pre- and post-RA
self, with the experience of RA exacerbating their pre-RA
responses. Some women described themselves as having
become "introverted and retiring" (Brigitta). One woman
described herself as more negative and sulky, a way of being
which influenced the experiences of other family members:
You become more, get a more negative attitude [toward activity]
you think it's kind of boring and that also influences everyday
life, and other family members also think it's hard, boring.
Maybe you become more sulky, so to speak, you think it`s a pain
and then the others also get affected. (Maria)
The Body as Self
The physicality of RA, the pain, stiffness, and the swelling of
joints was described by some of the women as shifting the
body from the margins of self-concept to the fore. This was
expressed in a number of different ways, with some women
identifying an emotional distance between themselves and
their bodies particularly during flares. One woman described
this separation in terms of "not belonging with the disease"
(Brigitta) and expressed feeling "like another person in flare
ups." Other women spoke of feeling consumed by their bod-
ies. One woman described "thinking about (her body) all the
time," especially during physical activities such as walking
or vacuum cleaning:
Yes I think a lot about my body, for example when I vacuum
clean. That is almost one of the worst things or when I go for a
walk or something, all the time I'm thinking about my arms. I feel
that I always worry about it. I think about it all the time. (Maria)
Creating a Positive Self
Besides these difficulties, some of the women described pos-
itive shifts in not only how they understood themselves but
also how they engaged with and made sense of others in the
world. One woman felt she had become a "stronger person,"
who "knew how to handle difficult situations and no longer
complained about minor things" (Eva). Another woman
identified having developed greater empathy for people. For
this woman, the experience of RA had broadened her aware-
ness and understanding of other people's experiences:
Actually you become hardy in another way, and then it's easier
to understand other people too. Maybe they don't understand
8 SAGE Open
me, but it becomes easier to feel empathy for others when you
are feeling bad yourself sometimes. (Anna)
For one woman, the use of supports such as assistive aids had
allowed her to gain control in her everyday life. Instead of per-
manently adapting to an activity, this woman would use physi-
cal aids and ask others for help when she decided she wanted
support. For this woman, RA was not all-defining, rather as
she asserts, "the disease has had to adapt to me a bit" (Mikaela).
Emotional Fallout
The emotional journeys recounted by the women in this
research highlight the subjective and inherently personal
impacts of RA. Feelings of anger, sadness, and frustration
were recounted by the women as they negotiated the emo-
tional fallout from their experiences of living with RA. As
one woman explained, "Sometimes it was easy to think neg-
ative thoughts," to question "why me? This is unfair"
(Maria). The women also spoke of their capacity to renegoti-
ate the position of RA in their understandings of self. One
woman referred to this capacity as "putting the problem
behind me" a way of sidelining the impacts. While acknowl-
edging the difficulties of this process, one woman was ada-
mant about the need to "think positive thoughts and try to
find possibilities instead of dwelling on the problems"
(Anna). Drawing on a similar strategy, another woman spoke
of her need to keep both her emotional and physical life in
balance so that the "condition did not take over."
Some of the women spoke of coming to terms with their
experiences, accepting the circumstances and increasing
their awareness of the possibilities of a life with RA. Some
women also spoke of the importance of learning to be honest
with themselves within this process of acceptance: honest
about their capacities, about "lowering demands and setting
up realistic goals." One woman describes as follows:
You have to admit to yourself that you can't manage all this, that
you can't put too many demands on yourself because then you
just feel worse. No, my mental adjustment has been to set up
realistic goals that I know can be reached, and not say I want to
do this and that and then never do it. (Ingrid)
This notion of "learning to live with RA" referred to the
constant evaluation of everyday life, not only in terms of the
tangible but also about what was meaningful and valuable
for each of the women. For many of the women, sharing their
diagnosis and the experience of RA with family and/or
friends was fraught with competing emotions. Reluctance to
talk with family and/or friends about RA was explained by a
desire to maintain independence and autonomy, fear of being
cast in the "sick role," and of not being believed or under-
stood. For one woman, this reluctance was heightened by her
experience of being "treated with suspicion" by her work
colleagues when she was not able to perform an activity:
"That is what is most sad, that people . . . that this is a disease
that no one can see and so they don't believe you" (Anna).
Discussion
Re-Storying the Self and Others
Contemporary explorations of the lived experience of
chronic conditions such as RA highlight the ways in which
people re-author their lives in the context of disability, creat-
ing new ways of understanding themselves and their rela-
tionships with others (Reeve, Loyd-Williams, Payne,
& Dowrick, 2010; Rice, Chandler, Harrison, Liddiard, &
Ferrari, 2015; Sanderson, Calnan, Morris, Richards, &
Hewlett, 2011; S. Williams, 2003). Within the context of this
research, each of the women identified moments which
reflect aspects of Bury's (1982) concept of "biographical dis-
ruption." The lived experience of RA, the fluctuations in
physical and emotional capacities, had undermined the
authority of the taken for granted assumptions and explana-
tory frameworks they relied on for a sense of "self in the
world" (Bury, 1982; S. Williams, 2000; S. Williams, 2003).
The disruption was personal, affecting their understandings
of self, the meanings they made of the roles, and activities
and tasks they performed in their immediate and broader
contexts. Dubouloz etal.'s (2004) research focusing on the
meaning constructions of people with RA reported similar
findings, with participants describing experiences of being
"redefined by illness" and an overwhelming sense "they
could not control the illness but were controlled by it"
(p. 401). Alsaker and Josephsson (2003) provide similar evi-
dence suggesting that the unpredictability of RA can create a
space of suspense in which people experience an ever-present
fear of "getting stuck" (p. 174). Personal identity and self-
concept which had once been stable were now in flux, frag-
mented, and disjointed; meanings of self in the world were
subject to the uncertainty of the condition. There was an
expressed desire to return to the known self, "the person they
used to be." Such sentiments echo with Plach etal.'s (2004)
research with women living with RA, who described them-
selves as "out of synch with who they had been . . . [and] . . .
with who they had thought they would become in the future"
(p. 145).
The concept of biographical disruption although impor-
tant is not without critique and a closer reading of the wom-
en's accounts highlights the need for more complex and
nuanced understandings of living with RA and its "disrup-
tive" effects within everyday life (Reeve et
al., 2010).
Contemporary conceptualizations of the self as an embodied
and active agent challenge the notion of disruption as all-
consuming and permanent (S. Williams, 2003), reflecting
Sanderson etal.'s (2011) proposition that "biographical dis-
ruption may form only one part of a person's multilayered
illness narrative" (p. 630).
The postmodern understanding of self were fluid and
dynamic, embedded in context, offers an alternate account to
the coherent and stable self, evident within biographical dis-
ruption (Carel, 2007). The women in this research actively
negotiated and re-negotiated domestic and work routines
Barns et al. 9
alongside their interactions and relationships with family and
friends (S. Williams, 2000). These negotiations were not
only practical in their focus but also often entailed a funda-
mental rethinking of meanings made and values held.
Sanderson etal. (2011) describe this re-framing of self as a
form of narrative reconstruction, a process of creating "points
of reference between the (changed) body, self and society,
reconstructing the past so that it has meaning or purpose for
the present" (p. 619). The process is dynamic and open,
allowing for "the weaving of "new symptoms, new knowl-
edge of the condition, and new reactions from others into the
story" (Sanderson etal., 2011, p. 619).
Similarly, contemporary conceptualizations of chronic ill-
ness as an embodied or corporeal experience challenge the
"over-emphasis on a cognitive view of the self" within bio-
graphical disruption (Reeve etal., 2010; S. Williams, 2003).
The relegation of the body to the margins is at odds with the
lived experience of RA (Reeve etal., 2010; S. Williams &
Bendelow, 1998). The physicality of RA, the fluctuating
periods of flare and remission alongside the everyday experi-
ence of joint stiffness and pain means that the body cannot be
ignored or made to "dis-appear" (Flurey et
al., 2014; S.
Williams, 2003). Carel (2007) describes grieving for the
changing and unpredictable body "appropriated" by RA;
"the biological body behaves oddly; it exhibits strange symp-
toms and becomes unpredictable. The transparent silent
function of the biological body is gone" (p. 99). Many of the
women within this research shared their struggles of negoti-
ating their "different" bodies, and recalled their efforts, to
develop new and alternate methods for performing the "nor-
mal" routines of everyday life. Adaptations informed by both
physical and emotional considerations were developed by
the women in an effort to recreate meaningful interactions
and engagements with everyday life (S. Williams, 2000).
These practices reflect Coventry etal.'s (2014) concept of a
"bodily consciousness," a way of knowing and being that is
able to respond to and priorities "the embodied and emo-
tional work invested in living with illness" (p. 109).
Negotiating Normal
In recent years, the language of "normal" and "normalcy"
within disability discourses has been rejected, replaced by
the language of ability and capacity (Goodley, 2012). Yet,
within the women's stories of living with RA, one of the key
themes arising was their desire to "be" or "remain normal."
Discussions of the "normal" have a long history in the litera-
ture on chronic conditions. In general terms, "normal"
describes a life with some certainty and predictability, where
pain and disability do not override participation in the activi-
ties of everyday life (Wiener, 1975, p. 98). For the women in
this research, the desire to be "normal" was related to a time
and space before diagnosis, before RA. Wiener's (1975)
interactionist research from the mid-1970s identifies the
"normal" as part of people's experiences of RA. In this early
research, Wiener described everyday life for people living
with RA as "a nightmare race . . . a constant competition"
between two competing domains: the physiological impacts
of RA and the activities needing to be performed as part of
"normal" everyday life. Uncertainty was generated from not
knowing which domain would dominate and in what ways
(Wiener, 1975). Two decades later, Whitley, Beck, and
Rutkowski (1999, p. 81) draw attention to the link between
the "normal" and the "certain." The "normal" was a space
that could be controlled, that was certain, stable, and predict-
able while allowing for positive spontaneity (Whitley etal.,
1999). For many of the women in this research, the "normal"
was a space in which the everyday routines, tasks, activities,
and interactions with others could occur with minimal inter-
ruption from the impacts of RA. Minimal interruption
encompassed the absence of or reduction in pain and disabil-
ity or the capacity to "cover-up" or "keep out" the impacts of
RA (Wiener, 1975, p. 98), a description that resonates with
Schulman-Green etal.'s (2012, p. 140) concept of the "new
normal."
Adapting to Adaptations?
RA as a disruption "forced" the women to consider adjust-
ment, including what type of adaptation might be made and
the implications, personal and social, of any such changes.
Since the early 1990s, research focusing on the lived experi-
ence of chronic conditions, such as RA, have produced stage
models of adaptation (Neill, 2002; Walker, Jackson, &
Littlejohn, 2004). These frameworks share a common focus
on sequential stages of acceptance, adjustment, and nor-
malcy (Neill, 2002). While such frameworks can be useful in
providing a trajectory "mud map" Schulman-Green et
al.
(2012) point to the focus on the physical and practical to the
neglect of the subjective in these models of adaptation. Other
approaches can "overemphasise the cheerful, existentially
transformative" elements of adaptation, minimizing the
"mundane and ordinary features such as pain, mobility
impairment, anxiety or dependency" (Thorne & Paterson,
1998, p. 176). The women's accounts provide differing views
and experiences of adaptation, accounts which speak to the
"messiness" of living with and "adapting to" RA (Schulman-
Green etal., 2012). Physical, social, and emotional adaptions
were made within the many spaces the women occupied and
involved the embodied negotiation of the structural and rela-
tional dimensions of everyday life (Moss, 1997).
It is clear from the women's accounts that there was no
one view of adaptation or one adaptive solution that could be
used across all contexts. For some women, assistive aids and
other adaptations facilitated their participation in the every-
day activities integral to the performance of "being normal."
For these women, achieving "normal" included a readjusted
understanding of particular roles and activities, and a recon-
structed self which embraced adaptations (Sanderson etal.,
2011). Adaptation was not a presumed practice. As some of
10 SAGE Open
the women reported, not all adaptations were considered to
be either feasible or desirable. Adaptations could be costly;
potential loss of independence increased feelings of being
handicapped [sic] and further alienation from self were iden-
tified as potential barriers and/or deterrents. Adaptations
could also be experienced as detrimental to self-concept, a
reminder of the "dysfunctioning" or "deviant" body
(Dubouloz etal., 2004; Lempp etal., 2006). The ability to
choose and to control is paramount in any decision relating
to adaptation (Lindsay, MacGregor, & Fry, 2014). For some
women, bearing the physical pain associated with a particu-
lar activity was preferable to RA imposing constraints and
forcing adaptations. For these women, choosing to minimize
or ignore the impact of RA can be described as a form of pas-
sive coping (Whitley etal., 1999). Rather than a negative
response, Whitley etal. (1999) identify the utility of passive
coping: a means by which people can continue to engage
with an activity despite the associated disabilities. According
to Whitley et
al., passive coping is actually an adaptive
mechanism, providing another means for people with chronic
conditions to "maintain a degree of normalcy" (p. 91)
Without ignoring the physical difficulties and emotional
struggles which can accompany processes of adaptation,
Carel (2007) highlights the potential for empowerment and a
renewed sense of autonomy: "Being able to improvise and
create new ways of compensating for a lost capacity demon-
strates the plasticity of behaviour and the human capacity to
adjust to change" (p. 104). For one woman, being "realistic"
about her physical capacity allowed her to "lower expecta-
tions" and as a result, decrease the emotional fallout associ-
ated with not being able to achieve set goals. Adaptation in
this sense can facilitate what Lindsay etal. (2014) describe
as "a sense of existential power, a power to care for the self"
(p. 238).
The Body
Whether feeling removed or separate from her body or con-
sumed by it, each of the women in this research described the
centrality of the body within their everyday lives (Ahistrand
etal., 2012; Dubouloz etal., 2004; Plach etal., 2004). In RA,
the body is the site of pain and disability--it is both object
and subject, a biological body and a lived body (Peuravaara,
2013), and it can be experienced as both distant and immedi-
ate (Carel, 2007). Everyday activities from house work to
shopping were now disrupted by the inconvenience of "the
noncompliant body" (Plach etal., 2004, p. 148). Flares also
drew attention to the body with the pain experienced as "a
form of `bodily alienation' or `betrayal'" (S. Williams, 2000,
p. 43). For some of the women, the need for adaptations in
their everyday lives had led to a new focus on the body, as
though recognizing its presence for the first time (Plach etal.,
2004). Kelly and Field (1996) identify this awakening of the
embodied self as occurring within the context of the noncom-
pliant body, when "the individual becomes acutely aware of
the discrepancy between body and self" (p. 249). Even in
times relatively free from pain, the prevention strategies and
"body awareness" regimes required a continued focus on the
body (Ahistrand etal., 2012). It is clear that within the con-
text of RA the taken for granted status of the body, its previ-
ous role as a silently functioning entity (Carel, 2007, p. 99)
had shifted to a new focus on the "bodily states not usually
brought into consciousness" (S. Williams, 2000, p. 43).
The female body with RA is an important feature of femi-
nist contributions to disability studies (Crow, 1996; Moss,
1997; Wendell, 1996). Research has suggested that the domi-
nant presence of body in women's understandings and expe-
riences of chronic conditions such as RA is related to their
domestic roles, and the positioning of household tasks and
activities in their everyday lives (Moss, 1997). In terms of
narrative reconstruction, the lived experience of RA had not
only interrupted the individual woman but also the woman as
mother, wife/partner. The capacity to perform these ascribed
roles was important to how the women understood them-
selves and their position in society more broadly (Moss,
1997). Harrison (2003) highlights the issue of gender in her
study with young women who have RA: "As a disease that
disproportionately affects women, RA bears on a number of
sex-related issues, including reproductive physiology, child-
bearing and childrearing, social behaviour, and quality of
life" (p. 846). However, as some of the women describe,
such roles are flexible and can be redefined and reshaped.
Drawing on family for support and reorganizing household
responsibilities and resources can facilitate the achievement
of activities while confirming meaningful constructions of
self (Prodinger, Shaw, Stamm, & Laliberte Rudman, 2014).
These negotiations resonate with Moss' (1997) research
which focused on the complex negotiations undertaken by
older women with RA as they engaged with the household
environment, the domestic structures, and the broader social
relations within their everyday lives. Moss identifies the
active role assumed by these women, demonstrating how
they negotiate "space in their home environments, both
physically and socially, via continually (re)assessing, (re)
shaping, and (re)structuring those negotiated spaces"
(pp. 23-24).
Strengths and Limitations
As with all research, there are areas for development as well as
directions for future inquiry. Similar to other studies which
draw participants from a "clinically captive" population, it is
likely that women not accessing health services may have dif-
ferent understandings and experiences of RA. It is also recog-
nized that participant numbers were low and from a
geographically limited area. While qualitative research is not
number driven, a larger number of participants would have
provided further a more in-depth account of the topic. Many of
the findings in this research resonate with and confirm the
results of other qualitative studies of women's experiences of
Barns et al. 11
RA. The strength of this research, while providing confirma-
tion for previous studies, is the commentary provided by the
women on the "emotional fallout" of RA. This issue is not
well covered in the research literature with the focus tending
to be on the adaptations people make and the processes under-
taken.As is identified in the literature (Carel, 2007; Schulman-
Green etal., 2012), there remains a lack of research engaging
with the emotional and subjective experiences of people with
chronic conditions such as RA. Further research utilizing vari-
ous qualitative methods (in-depth interviews, narrative jour-
nals, focus groups) could document the experience of women
with RA, across a period of time and contexts (work, study,
"stay-at-home mothers"). The information gathered would
contribute to the descriptive data on RA as a lived experience.
The focus on identifying the ways in which women engage
with and negotiate RA as an emotional-social-physical experi-
ence across time and within a diversity of places is particularly
important given the current reorienting of Western health and
welfare systems. As governments seek to reduce income sup-
port costs (disability pensions/allowances) and look to the
public and private sectors for employment opportunities for
people with disabilities, it is critical that any such policy and
practice is based on grounded evidence.
Conclusion
Bury's (1982) depiction of RA as a biographical disruption
provides a useful framing for understanding the lived experi-
ences of eight women whose accounts of living with RA have
been presented in this research. The disruption to their roles as
mothers and wives/partners, the new focus on the body and the
tensions relating to adaptation facilitated a re-authoring of the
self. A significant feature of the disruptions engendered
through RA was the emphasis the women gave to achieving
"normalcy" within their everyday lives. At times, when the
pain was minimal, living as "normal" was easier it was possi-
ble, even momentarily, to forget that RAwas part of their lives.
During flares, "being normal" was difficult and at times
impossible. The challenges associated with flare ups were par-
ticularly difficult to negotiate, bringing to the fore questions of
personal identity and expectations. Engagement with adap-
tions, such as the use of assistive aids, was contentious and
could be understood as empowering or disabling. Whatever
the decision made, what was important for each of the women
was "maintaining a sense of value and meaning in life, in spite
of symptoms and their effects" (Bury, 1991, p. 461).
