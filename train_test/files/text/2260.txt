N THE Tecumseh Community Health
I Study in 1959-1960, approximately 90
per cent of the residents of Tecumseh,
Michigan, underwent a comprehensive
health examination (TCHS I) in the course
of which information was collected regard-
ing certain symptoms, physical findings,
and laboratory manifestations of rheumatic
diseases. Similar information was collected
during a second series of examinations in
1962-1965 (TCHS 11). This report repre-
sents a follow-up of the 563 respondents
who in 1959-1960 had clinical findings sus-
picious for rheumatoid arthritis or a posi-
tive latex fixation test for rheumatoid fac-
tor.
METHODS
The methods employed in the first series of
examinations have been reported.1 During the
second round of examinations, conducted during
1962-1965,the examination procedures were very
similar except that several additional methods were
included. To the latex fixation tube dilution testa
which was employed in TCHS I, a commercial

slide latex fixation test3 and a human erythrocyte
agglutination test (HEAT)4 were added as sero-
logic tests for rheumatoid factor. In addition, in
TCHS I1 it was possible to obtain roentgenograms
of the hands and wrists (anteroposterior view)
and of the cervical spine (lateral view in flexion),
of the majority of participants 20 years of age or
over.
The tube dilution latex fixation test was consid-
ered positive if flocculation occurred in a dilution
of 1:20 or greater. The slide modification was
considered positive if the result was "reactive" as
defined by the manufacturer; weakly reactive
results were not considered significant. In the
case of the human erythrocyte agglutination test,
agglutination in a dilution of 1:16 or greater was
regarded as positive.
The radiographs of the hands and wrists and
cervical spine were interpreted by the authors
using the Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Ar-
thritis as a reference guide.5
Inso far as possible the American Rheumatism
Association (ARA) diagnostic criteria for rheuma-
toid arthritis6 were used as the basis of diagnostic
classificationin TCHS I. Only 7 of the 11 criteria
could be applied since radiologic examination of
the joints was not made, nor was it feasible to
examine synovial fluid or the histologic features of
the synovialis or subcutaneous nodules. The fol-

lowing four degrees of diagnostic certainty were
employed:
1. Questionable: These individuals had only
joint pain or tenderness or morning stiffness, or a
history of joint swelling; thus they failed to meet
the criteria for any of the defined diagnostic cate-
gories.
2
. Possible: The ARA criteria were employed,
except that sedimentation rates and C-reactive
protein tests were not performed.
3. Probable: These subjects fulfilled three or
four of the ARA diagnostic criteria.
4.Likely: These subjects fulfilled five or more
of the A.R.A.diagnostic criteria; this group there-
fore also includes those few individuals with
"classical" rheumatoid arthritis.
The comparability of the diagnostic classifica-
tions in TCHS I1 was complicated by the addition
of radiologic examinations, so that information was
obtained regarding 8 of the 1
1 criteria. The clas-
sification scheme was somewhat modified and sim-
plified from TCHS I, as follows:
1. Possible cases: One or two of the ARA
ticipated only in TCHS I with those who
participated both in TCHS I and I1 indi-
cated that the two groups did not differ to a
statistically significant degree with respect
to most of the characteristics in which they
could be compared. They were alike as to
distribution by age, sex, type of arthritis,
degree of certainty of diagnosis of rheuma-
toid arthritis, distribution of latex fixation
test titers, and distribution within the sam-
ples and strata of the total population.
Thus, for all practical purposes, the loss of
28.6 per cent of individuals of interest over
an average period of 4 years did not change
in any major way the group characteristics
of those who could be followed through a
second examination.
The diagnostic status of these 402respon-
dents is indicated in Table 1. It will be

comparable to the questionable and possible cate-
gories of TCHS I.

this group therefore includes "definite" and "clas-
sical" cases as defined by the ARA criteria.

RESULTS
Following completion of the second se-
ries of examinations, it was found that 402,
or 71.4 per cent, of the 563 individuals with
clinical suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis
TCHS I had been reexamined. This repre-
sents a rate of loss of 28.6 per cent between
the two examination periods. The interval
between examinations was highly variable
inasmuch as bemethod of calling in par-
erage interval was approximately 4 years,
and approximately 98 per cent of subjects
were examined within 3 to 6 years.

back into the possible category, 6 (12.8per
cent) had only a positive rheumatoid fac-
tor test, and 22 (46.8 per cent) had no
evidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Subjects
who were originally in the likely group
showed the least change, but even here
only 4 (21 per cent) were unchanged in
TCHS 11; 6 (31.6 per cent) were reclassi-
fied as probable, 2 (10.5 per cent) as pos-
sible, 3 (15.8 per cent) had only a positive
rheumatoid factor test, and 4 (21 per cent)
had no evidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Of
the 105 respondents who had a positive
latex fixation test as the only evidence of
rheumatoid arthritis in TCHS I, none was
found to have likely disease on reexamina-
tion and only 2 (1.9 per cent) probable
and 8 (7.6 per cent) possible rheumatoid
arthritis; 49 (46.7 per cent) continued to
have a positive serologic test for rheuma-
toid factor as their only abnormality, and
46 (43.8 per cent) had no evidence of
rheumatoid arthritis. Those subjects whose
tests became negative were observed for the
same average length of time, 4.1 years, as
were those whose tests remained positive.
Of those subjects with initially high titers
(1:640 or greater), 43 per cent remained
positive after an average of 4.4 years while
those with initially low titers (1:20-1:320
inclusive) had corresponding values of 45
per cent and 3.7 years. Of these 105 sub-
jects, only 25 (23.8 per cent) were positive
by the same latex fixation tube dilution
technic in both studies.
DISCUSSION
These results illustrate the difficulties
and uncertainties of prospective studies of
rheumatoid arthritis and serologic tests for
rheumatoid factor. In part, the difficulty
arises fmm the fact that rheumatoid ar-
thritis pursues a fluctuating course with at
least partial remissions and exacerbations.
In some cases transient episodes of disease
may occur which do not leave permanent
evidences of deformity and which may be
easily forgotten by the patient in a 4 year
period. While most population studies sug-
gest a much broader spectrum of severity
of rheumatoid arthritis than do hospital- or
clinic-based studies, there is still uncer-
tainty about the minimal requirements for
a diagnosis. It seems probable that a num-
ber of nonrheumatoid musculoskeletal con-
ditions, such as posttraumatic joint disease
and postviral arthritis, confuse the results

of population studies by fulfilling the diag-
nostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis to
varying degrees. It may be impossible to
separate these nonrheumatoid conditions
from rheumatoid arthritis in a single ex-
amination or to differentiate them from re-
mittent and/or intermittent rheumatoid ar-
thritis on repeated examination. It seems
unlikely that this dilemma will be resolved
until an etiologic definition of rheumatoid
arthritis is at hand.
The nonspecificity of rheumatoid factor
tests is well recognized, as is the fact that
they may be present transiently during or
following various infectious diseases, in-
cluding subacute bacterial endocarditis,
syphilis, yaws, leprosy, tuberculosis, infec-
tious hepatitis, kala azar, and schistosomia-
sis.' The situation has been compared to
that previously observed with the serologic
tests for syphilis, where acute or chronic
false positive results may occur. Consider-
able interest has centered on the possibil-
ity that positive tests for rheumatoid factor
may select individuals with an increased
risk of subsequent development of clinical
rheumatoid arthritis. The very limited data
available at present regarding this possibil-
ity are conflicting and do not provide a
clear answer. Ball and Lawrence,s on re-
examining after 5 years 19 seropositive sub-
jects who originally had no accompanying
clinical or radiological evidence of rheuma-
toid arthritis, found that 7 had developed
evidence of the disease, as compared to
only 5 of 57 seronegative subjects similarly
followed. In a similar study, Finnish inves-
tigator$' found that after an interval of 9
years none of a small group of 7 subjects
with apparently false-positive sheep cell
agglutination tests on original examination
had developed rheumatoid arthritis and
that 4 had become seronegative. More re-
cently, 3 apparently normal individuals
with high titers of rheumatoid factor were
reported not to have developed rheuma-
toid arthritis after an interval of 6 to 9
years, although the first had experienced
arthralgias and a nonspecific conjunctivitis,
the second intermittent eye symptoms, and
the third an episode of polyarthralgia fol-
lowed later by a "tennis elbow."1° In a brief
communication," this third patient is sub-
sequently reported to have developed clin-
ical and laboratory evidence of probable
systemic lupus erythematosus. In the Te-
cumseh community, it was found that only
about 24 per cent of otherwise healthy sero-
positive respondents remained seropositive
by the same technic after an average inter-
val of 4 years. Of this group of originally
seropositive subjects, none was found to
have developed definite or classic rheu-
matoid arthritis in this average 4 year
follow-up period, and only 1.9 per cent
were found to have evidence for probable
and 7.6 per cent evidence for possible dis-
ease.
Similarly, there seemed to be little evi-
dence that the varying diagnostic catego-
ries of rheumatoid arthritis constituted a
gradient along which respondents pro-
gressed toward a more certain diagnosis,
although the correlation coefficient ( r ) of
Table 1 is 0.401. In fact, of those respon-
dents originally in the possible and proba-
ble categories, the great majority moved
downward in the diagnostic scale and
about half were found to have no evidence
of rheumatoid arthritis. Even in the group
originally classified as having definite rheu-
matoid arthritis this trend was apparent,
with 21 per cent showing no evidence of
disease on reexamination. Again, these
findings are compatible either with the
view that rheumatoid arthritis, as it occurs
in the general population, pursues a much
more variable course than observed in hos-
FOUR YEAR FOLLOW-UP OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 91
pita1 or clinic settings, or with the view
that the picture is obscured by a number
of nonrheumatoid arthropathies which are
more frequently transient or self-limited.
It seems likely that both factors contribute
to the observed results.
