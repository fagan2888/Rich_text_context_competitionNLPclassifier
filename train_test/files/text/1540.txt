Introduction
Current increases in obesity levels in the United States have
been nothing short of epidemic. As recently as the year 1995,
the adult obesity rate in every state in the United States was well
below the 20% level, and in some cases under the 15% level. In
2007, however, all but one US state witnessed its adult obesity
rate exceed the 20% level. In the same year, the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimated that 36.7% of the US pop-
ulation was "overweight" and 26.3% could be categorized as
"obese" (1,2).
These increased levels of obesity constitute a major health
and economic problem for the United States. Physical health
risks faced by obese individuals include but are not limited
to osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some
forms of cancer, and an overall increased probability of mor-
tality. In addition to physical heath problems related to obesity,
there are also major psychological and social implications of
this disease. Obese individuals may suffer from having fewer
friendships, they may be considered less attractive, or they may
otherwise be subject to societal prejudice or social stigma (3).
The economic costs commonly associated with obesity include
the health-care costs of prevention and the treatment of 
obesity
and comorbid conditions.
Research in this area has focused on determining what char-
acteristics of individuals, families, and communities are related
to increased levels of obesity with the ultimate goal being to
employ these characteristics to decrease average levels of obes-
ity (4­11). The current analysis focuses on an individual char-
acteristic related to nutritional content. Specifically, this work
analyzes the relationship between iron deficiency and average
levels of obesity in the adult population of females.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers iron defi-
ciency to be one of the most prevalent nutritional disorders in
the world. They estimate that >30% of the world population is
iron deficient. In North America, a total of 7.1 million women
(pregnant and nonpregnant) and preschool aged children are
iron deficient (WHO figures, 2004) (12). Deficiency of iron
most commonly develops when an individual does not ingest a
sufficient amount of iron to meet average dietary needs. It may
also occur, however, in the case of iron-absorption problems or
heavy loss of blood, where an individual is ingesting the appro-
priate amount of iron but will still develop iron deficiency. For
example, an individual could lose blood due to frequent blood
donations, heavy menstruation, or certain stomach and intes-
tinal conditions such as food sensitivity. In fact, a joint report
by the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
statesthat"deficienciesofothernutrientssuchasvitaminAmay
also cause a functional iron deficiency even when iron stores
are adequate" (see WHO site for micronutrients http://www.
who.int/nutrition/topics/ida/en/). Females are considered at
higher risk of iron deficiency than males. This increased prob-
ability of iron deficiency holds when comparing comparable
aged men and women in each age category. Women lose blood
in relation to menstruation and other life stages; resulting in a
depletion of the iron content in their bodies. It is partially for
this reason that we chose to focus specifically on women in the
current analysis.
We hypothesize that iron deficiency is related to an individ-
ual's BMI and proceed to examine this possibility empirically.
Iron and Obesity in Females in the United States
Florence Neymotin1 and Urmimala Sen2
Since the late 1980s, the United States has witnessed a dramatic increase in average BMI levels and the proportion
of individuals categorized as obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for a variety of illnesses, and an increase in obesity
is, therefore, implicated in increased health-care costs in the United States. These ultimately translate to a major
health and economic problem for the United States. The present analysis examines a pathway to increased levels
of obesity as of yet almost entirely unexplored. Specifically, we examine the relationship between obesity and iron
deficiency via analyses of blood samples. The current analysis employs public-use data files from the continuous
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999­2006) survey to determine the relationship between
obesity and an individual's iron blood content. Results suggest a negative relationship between levels of iron blood
content and individual BMI after controlling for other individual characteristics. These results hold for nearly all eight
panels tested in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions.

Epidemiology
The concentration is on the adult female population as men-
tioned above. We employ Continuous National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) public-use panel
data from 1999 to 2006 for the empirical portion of the analy-
sis. This paper is unique in demonstrating that there is indeed
a relationship between blood iron and obesity for the adult
female population in the United States.
The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Methods
and Procedures section describes the data and empirical meth-
ods and procedures employed in the analysis. Results section
presents summary statistics and results. Discussion section
presents conclusions and a discussion of directions for future
research.
Methods and Procedures
The NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics to assess the health and nutritional status
of adults and children in the United States. We employ the public-use
continuous NHANES surveys for the years 1999­2006, run in 2-year
groupings. Specifically, the survey groups we employ are for 1999­2000,
2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006. NHANES employs a stratified
sampling procedure: The Primary Sampling Units are first selected. The
Primary Sampling Units are generally single counties although small
counties are sometimes combined to meet minimum population size
requirements. The Primary Sampling Units are next segmented and
households within each segment are chosen by a process of random
selection. Finally, individuals within each household are sampled ran-
domly from within the households. Oversampling within geographic
areas is employed for the following groups: low income, racial minori-
ties, children, and the elderly. The survey combines both interviews and
physical examinations. BMI is assessed through the use of a physical
examination rather than (possibly flawed) individual reports of height
and weight. Information on iron content is elicited through blood sam-
ples for various subsections of the population. Cohorts 1999­2000 and
2001­2002 perform the tests for iron deficiency on all eligible individ-
uals aged 1 year and older. However, the sampling method has been
changed in the case of NHANES 2003­2004 and 2005­2006, where the
tests are performed on 3- to 5-year-old adolescents and females aged
12­59 years. These individuals in particular are sampled due to their
increased risk of iron deficiency. Demographic information is elic-
ited through interview responses of individuals. As mentioned previ-
ously, only female responses are employed in the current analysis. Data
restrictiveness was a factor in deciding to focus on women in this study.
During several of the relevant years of the NHANES only samples of
females were maintained.
We run three ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with BMI as the
dependent variable and Iron as the explanatory variable of interest. The
initial specification is augmented in the second and third specifications,
which allow for interactions between age and iron and between race and
iron, respectively, to determine whether the relationship between iron
and BMI is differentially impacted by either individual race or age. We
chose to focus on race and age in particular due to the current interest in
racially driven patterns of obesity as well as patterns differentially impact-
ing children vs. adults (13). We also employ standard additional con-
trol characteristics to capture the notions of socioeconomic status--via
income and education, the biggest factors in constructing socioeconomic
status measures--and nativity: both considered key factors in affecting
obesity rates.
In particular, we believe that if our analysis ignored either education
or income (our socioeconomic status markers), then our estimate of the
relationship between iron and BMI would be biased as both are affected
by education, and similarly for income. Higher BMI individuals tend to
have lower income (particularly for women) although this gap in income
has recently been shrinking, and iron deficiency is often cited as a causal
factor in lowering individual (and eventually national) levels of income
and productivity (14­16). Therefore, an estimated bias would occur by
leaving out the income variable from our analysis. Similarly, we know that
obesity is related to lower levels of educational attainment, and anemia is
related to lower enrollment rates in schooling (17­19). Taken together,
leaving out a control variable for education would bias our estimate of the
relationship between BMI and iron deficiency, as it would be picking up
these variable's additional relationships with educational attainment.
The baseline OLS regression employed for our analysis is given by
Equation (1).

Iron is measured in micrograms per deciliter (g/dl) of blood. Age is
measuredinyears.Educationismeasuredinyearsattained.Incomerep-
resents the annual Current Population Survey family income (20). The
variables Race, Marital Status, and Country are eponymous dummies;
Race includes dummies for Mexican, Other Hispanic, Black, and Other
Races (implying races other than the four mentioned, which includes
multiracial individuals). The Marital Status dummies include variables
for individuals who are Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, and
Never Married. We also control for whether the individual was born
in United States/Mexico/other country via the Country dummy. The
variable u is the error term.
We next focus on the relationship between age, iron content, and BMI.
We would like to determine whether iron has a differential impact on
BMI by age. Our regression for analysis is given by Equation (2).

We add an interaction term between age and iron (Age-Iron) as well
as a square of the age variable (Age2) to allow for a nonlinear rela-
tionship between age and BMI. All other variables are defined as in
Equation (1).
To examine whether there is a differential impact on BMI of iron con-
tent by race, we introduce interactions between race and the level of iron
and we have Equation (3).

We have replaced the age­iron interaction term with race­iron inter-
action terms (respectively Mexican­Iron, Other Hispanic­Iron,
Black­Iron, and Other Races­Iron). All other variables are defined as
in specification 2.
As we conclude our description of methods, we would like to point
out the NHANES data, which permit us to measure iron currently con-
tained in the blood but not iron intake. For this reason, our analysis
will not allow us to distinguish between iron deficiencies that are due to
a problem with absorption and those that arise due to a problem with
intake--such as a nutritional deficiency. Ideally, we would have a measure
of iron intake as well as iron deficiency that would allow us to distinguish
between these two different routes; however, this is not feasible in the
data in question.
Results

ables in the analysis while stratifying on year of interest.
Statistics are further distinguished by whether the full sample
or the controlled sample is employed, where the controlled

sample is the group of individuals actually used in the regres-
sion analysis from each panel and the full sample includes
all women surveyed in the panel. Each of the variables: Age
(in years), Education and Annual Current Population Survey
Family Income display similar means in both the full and the
controlled sample. BMI's mean value differs between the full
and the controlled sample due to the varying gender compo-
sition between the full and controlled samples. In NHANES
1999­2000 and 2001­2002, since the iron tests were car-
ried out on all eligible individuals aged 1 year and above, the
count for the BMI and Iron variables include both the male
and female population. The count for the other variables (Age
(in years), Education and Annual Current Population Survey
Family Income) includes only the female population aged 12
years and above. In NHANES 2003­2004 and 2005­2006, the
iron tests were carried out only on all adolescents females aged
either 3­5 years or 12­59 years, as these groups were consid-
ered to be at maximum risk of iron deficiency. In these years,
the count for the BMI variable includes both the male and
female population, whereas the count for the other variables

(Age (in years), Education and Annual Current Population
Survey Family Income) includes only the female population
aged 12­59 years. It should be noted that although these years
include a "count" for the full population, the statistical analysis
of effects of the relationship of BMI to iron levels is restricted
to only the female population for all years in question. Average
BMI always exceeds a value of 27 in each cohort, which cor-
responds to the range "overweight" as per Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention definitions. The mean of the Iron vari-
able differs in the initial two cohorts as the full sample includes
both the male and female population. The standard deviations
measures for included variables are similar in the full and
controlled samples. These results imply some degree of selec-
tion into our controlled sample, but we think they should be
generally representative of the larger underlying population.
The regression results for empirical Equations (1)­(3) are
displayed in Tables 2­4, respectively. Panels A, B, C and D rep-
resent the four NHANES cohorts for 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
2003­2004 and 2005­2006. It did not make sense to pool the
regression results because of differences in coding several of
the variables in the analysis. The data sets were large enough
not to consider sample size in choosing to have separate regres-
sions. Race, marital status, and country of birth dummies are
included in all regressions with coefficients not displayed.

The regression results from Table 2 show that iron levels
are highly statistically significant in relation to BMI for all
four cohorts under analysis--robust t-statistics for Iron range
from 8.49 to 11.13--lending support to the initial idea that
iron deficiency and BMI have a significant relationship in the
data. Interestingly, the variable Age (in years) is significant in
all cohorts. This result stands in contrast with the Israeli study
among children aged 3­19 years, where age and gender did not
have an effect on BMI (21).
Table 3 shows the level of iron is statistically significant in
relation to BMI after adding age interactions in all four cohorts
of the data. The robust t-statistics for the Iron variable range
from 2.59 to 11.02 across three panels for the age­iron regres-
sions. These are for the initial three cohorts only (1999­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004). In Panel D, iron is not significant
when we add the age­iron interaction term. After adding addi-
tional terms, however, iron once again becomes significant. The
interaction between age and iron is not itself significant until
the 2005­2006 cohort (Panel D). The relationship between
BMI and iron levels is not different based on age group for the
earlier years of the data but it does differ by age for later years.
The regression results from Table 4 show that Iron and Age
(in years) are significant in all cohorts and regressions. It is sur-
prising that, barring some isolated cases, none of the race­iron
interaction terms are significant, implying that there is no dif-
ferential relationship between iron and BMI by race.
We measure BMI elasticities for the iron­BMI relationship
across the panel of 8 years. The elasticities in Supplementary
Table S1 online are calculated using sample means and the
coefficients from all three rounds of the regression analysis. An
elasticity is a type of sensitivity analysis commonly employed in
some of the social sciences. Specifically, we examine how a 1%
increase in iron deficiency affects BMI rates percentage-wise.
The figures from Supplementary Table S1 online indicate that
over the panel of 8 years, as iron deficiency increases by 1%,
average BMI will correspondingly increase by ~0.10% on aver-
age. This value dips in some cases, but remains fairly constant
between 0.11 and 0.14%. However, it would be prudent to point
out that perhaps iron is just one of the causal factors; several
more such as changes in the environment, an increase in con-
sumption of fast food, sedentary lifestyles with several hours of
television viewing, and less hours of exercise, etc. have already
been documented. One widely cited reason for this increase in
obesity in the United States is unhealthy food habits of all indi-
viduals. It is logical to conclude that if an individual is eating
less of iron-rich foods such as beans, dried fruits, eggs, cereals,
bread, or pasta that are fortified with iron, vegetables such as
spinach, and more of high-calorie fast foods, that would natu-
rally lead to low level of iron as well as a high level of obesity. It
is also probable that there have been certain genetic changes in
the population, and one of these changes that adversely affect
the BMI of an individual is the drop in iron levels. It is also
worth noting that deficiency of iron affects individual working
capacity (22). Individuals with low levels of iron would, there-
fore, tend to become more sedentary and exercise less. This
would lead to an increase in the tendency to gain weight.
We compare our results with comparable elasticity measures
reported by Rashad et al. (23)--standards in this literature--
when examining the effect of a 1% increase of per capita res-
taurants on BMI rates (unfortunately, nothing comparable to
the iron relationship is yet available because the literature is so
new on this topic). They find that average adult BMI increases
by 0.09% with an increase in per capita number of restaurants
of 1% (23). We find a similar relationship. However, in the

present analysis, we are considering a slightly different factor
of interest, namely iron content. We are unsurprised that the
percentage change in BMI is slightly higher as a result of an
iron deficiency because there presumably exists a multifaceted
relationship between iron deficiency and BMI, as compared to
an external impact of the increase in the number of restaurants
in one's neighborhood.
Because we do not have a definitive measure of whether the
iron-deficient individuals studied were suffering from a lack
of iron intake or a defect of absorption, or some combination
thereof, it is useful to discuss possible routes for the relation-
ship we have found for these scenarios. Straightforward intui-
tion posits that low iron levels due to insufficient intake can be
a signal of a generally nutrient-poor (and thus calorie dense)
diet, which in turn will be correlated with higher rates of obes-
ity. This is the more likely cause, as our data set represents the
result of a random sampling scheme, and is fairly consistent
across ages and racial backgrounds. We believe that if the cor-
relation was due to reduced iron absorption, this heretofore
unrecognized defect would need to be widespread enough to
be present for all racial groups and ages to be the main effect
we are seeing in the data. For this reason, we doubt that this is
the primary cause, although we cannot definitively rule it out.
We should also note another potential route of inter-
est between anemia and BMI could be that iron deficiency
(regardless of whether it is an issue of intake or of absorption)
is likely to make individuals feel sluggish, and the resultant
lack of exercise may lead to increased BMI.
One other route documented in the literature, which we
believe to be a minor issue in our analysis, is the relationship
between post-gastric-bypass and initial morbid obesity--as we
believe few individuals in our data will have encountered this
type of surgery, and the obesity and anemia do not generally
occur concurrently (24).
A final route, also minor but meriting mention, is the rela-
tionship between low pregestational iron stores in the form
of ferritin and anemia at some point during pregnancy (25).
These pregnant women would show up as obese in the data
later in their term. Although this relationship between obesity
via pregnancy and anemia via reduced pregestational ferritin
levels has been documented, once again because our results are
prevalent at all ages, we do not believe that this is the main fac-
tor driving our results.
Discussion
Rising rates of obesity are widely recognized as a major pub-
lic health concern. To combat this rise in obesity, we require
thorough knowledge of the actual cause of the disease and
how it works, as well as how it becomes such an epidemic.
The Surgeon General's call to action to prevent and decrease
overweight and obesity is the correct step in this direction.
However, much more work is required before it may be truly
claimed that obesity has been successfully tackled.
We have established that the level of obesity among the
female population (12 years and above) in the United States
is correlated with iron levels after accounting for a variety
of other demographic characteristics. The results of the OLS
regressions indicate that iron is highly significant in relation to
individual BMI. This is true in the baseline specification as well
as in the alternative specifications. Specifically, there appears to
be a negative relationship between iron levels and the level of
individual BMI. There is no evidence of a differential impact of
iron by race and little evidence of a differential impact of iron
by age (especially for the earlier years of the dataset).
One point worth noting, however, is that the exact process by
which iron levels affect an individual's BMI is still medically in
question. Most medical studies have used cross-sectional data
and have concluded that there is indeed a negative relationship
between BMI and iron levels. Our study uses a much larger sam-
ple in terms of number of observations and time span, controls
for a larger number of demographic characteristics and still finds
the same negative relationship, lending support to these medical
studies with a more reliable data set and analysis.
The current analysis has clearly established a correlational,
although not a definitively causal, relationship between iron
deficiency and BMI. A causal relationship would indicate the
unambiguous benefit of iron supplementation in the popula-
tion of individuals likely to develop anemia. Nevertheless, it is
possible given the results of the current analysis that identifica-
tion of individuals with low iron levels will serve as method of
targeting those at risk of developing obesity.
