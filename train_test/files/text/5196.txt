Introduction
Herman Melville's short story, "Bartleby the Scrivener," is
one of the most critically discussed works of fiction in
American literature. The main character has been diagnosed
as everything from a schizophrenic, to an autistic, from a
person with borderline personality disorder to one with
Asperger's syndrome. He has been described as a melan-
cholic, a schizoid, a Job/Christ figure, a passive aggressive,
an alienated worker, and an innocent victim, as well as an
individual manifesting "pure potentiality . . . someone whose
actions we ourselves should strive for" (Giles, 2007, p. 88).
He has likewise been viewed as a symbol for Melville who,
like his famous character, alienated himself from society by
preferring not to copy the formula for the kinds of popular
works that dominated the literary market of his day. All of
these critics admit, however, that Bartleby, inspiring or not,
is "the most provoking test of brotherhood one is ever likely
to encounter either in fiction or in life," an individual whose
"power to exasperate is the kind that inspires legends"
(Anderson, 1981, p. 386). The lawyer who narrates the tale
has likewise been the subject of a similar number of varied
critical perspectives. Thus, he has been described as self-
serving in some articles, but well-meaning in others. He has
been characterized as everything from psychotic to comical,
from being nihilistic and devoid of social conscience to being
Christlike. It is no wonder that Lewis Leary (1979) observed
years ago that "no one key opens [the story] to a simple, or
single, precise meaning" (p. 15). Indeed, like few other
works of fiction, Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener" seems
to draw critics--of all persuasions--like a magnet. Perhaps
this is because, as Milton Stern (1979) has observed, "The
story offers numerous `ideological possibilities' and thus the
seer of psychiatric, political, literary, metaphysical or reli-
gious positions is sure to find in the tale a paradigm for his
own advocacy" (p. 19).
A view of the story that heretofore has not received any
critical attention is one that applies the methodology of social
science to literary analysis by focusing on the narrative's
office setting as a site of social organization. As members
inhabiting a specific cultural space, the narrator and his
employees operate, as the sociologist Dorothy Smith (1990)
has described it, within a framework of shared understand-
ings and an organized sequence of actions that are "constitu-
tive of the formality of a formal organization" (p. 219).
Within this organization, they adopt protocols and patterns in
their social relationships, which facilitate the functioning
that is integral to the organization's day-to-day operation.
Framing the narrative within this perspective opens up new

Office Setting as Organizational Structure
in "Bartleby the Scrivener"
Lori Duin Kelly1
Abstract
This article uses a methodology from the social sciences known as institutional ethnography to analyze the office setting
in Herman Melville's short story "Bartleby the Scrivener" as a site of social organization. This approach contributes to an
understanding of how that office came to adopt specific structures as crucial to its functioning and how, as a consequence
of those structures, individuals' roles within the organization's hierarchies became constituted. As fieldwork occurs inside of
organizations, institutional ethnography also provides a tool for identifying and evaluating linguistic markers for an individual's
placement within a larger organizational structure. This approach to the story seems particularly useful for understanding
the interpersonal dynamics at the heart of "Bartleby." At the same time, it provides a method for identifying the larger
institutional process at work in Melville's story, one that contributes to the reproduction of a system of social relations in
the workplace that requires subordination and compliance to insure its success.

understandings of the ensuing interpersonal dynamics within
the lawyer's operation that occur following the hiring of
Bartleby. It also helps explain why the manager is unable to
act decisively with an employee who behaves in a manner
that can best be described as "orthogonal" and why the threat
posed by the presence of a Bartleby inside of an organization
must be contained.
Method
This article draws extensively on a method of analysis used
in institutional ethnography which, as its name suggests,
involves fieldwork conducted inside of organizations. By
relying on peoples' actual experiences inside these organiza-
tions, institutional ethnographers are able to demonstrate not
only how these institutions come to adopt specific organiza-
tional patterns as essential to their functioning, but also how,
as a consequence of that functioning, interpersonal and hier-
archical relationships within these organizations are deter-
mined and constituted. Because a reliance on individuals'
actual experiences is central to its methodology, institutional
ethnography also provides a method for identifying and eval-
uating linguistic markers that are helpful for understanding
an individual's positioning within these structures. This
method of analysis seems especially relevant to understand-
ing the interpersonal office dynamics at work in Melville's
short story, as it provides a workable methodology with
which to explore issues like organizational communication,
as well as the nature of work roles and relations among a
specific group of individuals. It also provides a way to track
changing patterns of behavior inside of an organization and
the way these changing behavioral patterns come to be
reflected in hierarchies and language patterns inside of an
organizational space.
Overview of the Organization of the
Master of Chancery Office
The Office of the Master of Chancery in Melville's story has
one manager, a lawyer, who also functions as the omniscient
narrator of the story, and two employees with very distinct
work pathologies: an older worker, Turkey, who is most pro-
ductive in the early morning hours and less so as the noon
hour approaches and his younger counterpart, the ambitious
but frustrated Nippers, who pushes the work forward when
Turkey begins to falter. A third employee, Ginger Nut, func-
tions mainly as an errand boy for the operation. The prevail-
ing personality trait of the lawyer who heads up the operation
is caution. His preferred strategy for dealing with his employ-
ees appears to be an extraordinary willingness to order the
way work is performed within the organization in a way that
accommodates their eccentricities. It is obvious from what
the narrator reveals that this style of management has worked
well for him. His is, by the standards of 19th-century business
practice, a successful operation. This is apparent when he dis-
closes that his work "among rich men's bonds, and mort-
gages, and title deeds" (Melville, 1853a, pp. 546-547) has
drawn the attention of no less a personage than John Jacob
Astor who had "no hesitation in pronouncing my first great
point to be prudence, my next, method" (Melville, 1853a, p.
547). It is worth noting here that the values Astor endorses, at
least as reported by the narrator, are ones associated with cau-
tion and practicality in problem solving. As the narrator notes
that Astor himself is not prone to "poetic enthusiasm"
(Melville, 1853a, p. 547), it is tempting to speculate on the
extent to which Astor endorses individuals who display simi-
lar personality traits to his own. At any rate, what is evident is
that Astor's endorsement of him has contributed in no small
way to the success of the narrator's reputation. Appointment
to the Master of Chancery office suggests that how the lawyer
operates has won him the attention of those in a position to
appoint him to a rather lucrative post. It also suggests that the
lawyer has demonstrated an ability for organizing the work of
that office in a way that has been recognized and validated by
prominent individuals within the larger work community.
Bartleby's hire is a result of the subsequent increase in work
that follows on that appointment. As neither of his current
employees puts in a full day's work, the narrator is drawn to
Bartleby because he anticipates that he will have a positive
impact on the personalities of the other employees in the
organization. Describing Bartleby as "a man of so singularly
sedate an aspect" (Melville, 1853a, p. 549), the narrator antic-
ipates that his will be a calming presence that has the potential
to "operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey
and the fiery one of Nippers" (Melville, 1853a, p. 549). In the
long term, this amelioration of Turkey and Nipper's behav-
iors is a practical move that will contribute to their greater
efficiency and as a consequence, to even greater productivity
within the organization.
How Bartleby Functions Within This
Organization's Structures
Impact on Workplace Product and Process
At first, the narrator's decision to hire Bartleby appears to be
a sound one. Consistent with the organization's role of pro-
viding a steady delivery of product in a timely manner, the
lawyer's hire seems to fit well into the organization's exist-
ing structure. As a copyist, Bartleby generates an extraordi-
nary quantity of writing in a neat clear hand. He is the first
one in the office every morning and the last one to leave it
every night. The problem comes when Bartleby declines or
more accurately prefers not to discharge what the narrator
calls "an indispensable part of a scrivener's business"
(Melville, 1853a, p. 550)--verification of the accuracy of
copies. The practice of reading copies to check for errors is
constitutive. It directs social relations in the workplace, orga-
nizes and facilitates their functioning because it is integral to
Kelly 3
the successful discharge of the work performed there. As a
step in the organizational process, reading copies for accu-
racy is an example of what Smith (1990) calls the "appara-
tus" (p. 212) essential to the functioning of this specific
operation as it coordinates the work process in ways that
contribute to productivity and insure quality control. Indeed,
so essential is checking documents to the nature of the opera-
tion that from time to time, the lawyer, in a symbolic show of
camaraderie with this shared task, decenters himself from the
role of manager to participate in it. By stating that he would
prefer not to check copy, Bartleby derails this essential pro-
cess. The narrator's characterization of his request as "com-
mon usage" (Melville, 1853a, p. 551) with a "natural
expectancy of instant compliance" (Melville, 1853a, p. 550)
suggests a normative stance of acquiescence within the orga-
nization to this request. Thus, Bartleby's preference not to
read copy identifies him as requesting an accommodation for
which there is no precedent. Moreover, Bartleby's request to
be treated in a singularly unique way generates a profound
concern because with the increased workload, refusal to
comply with this normative practice has the potential to
derail the smooth functioning of the lawyer's operation.
Impact on the Other Employees
In addition to presenting a major challenge to the process
and, ultimately, generation of product that is central to the
livelihood of the Chancery operation, another impact
Bartleby has in this workplace is on the other employees,
Nippers, Turkey, and Ginger Nut. It is apparent that the
senior clerks already manifest forms of hysteria "in line with
the hypothesis of a pathogenic environment" (Mander, 2005,
p. 220), long before Bartleby arrives on the scene: Turkey is
an alcoholic and Nippers manifests recurrent stomach prob-
lems in response to what appear to be extraordinary stress
levels. Bartleby's incomprehensible actions are of a magni-
tude that has the potential to dissolve the smooth functioning
of an operation that supplies them with a living while it has a
proven history of successfully accommodating their idiosyn-
crasies. Even though accommodating the eccentricities of his
employees is central to how the manager has structured work
assignments inside his operation, efforts to accommodate a
growing list of preferences from Bartleby contribute to unan-
ticipated problems in the workplace. For one thing, accom-
modating Bartleby forces the lawyer to reassign Bartleby's
workload to his other employees, and in so doing, implement
a dramatic change in the routine of office duties. However, at
no point along the way does the lawyer draw his other
employees into the decision by providing them with a con-
text and timeline for his action. He could, for example, sug-
gest that the recusal of Bartleby from copying is temporary,
a move to accommodate the eyestrain suffered by overwork
sustained in his early days on the job. Moreover, by dispens-
ing with the requirement that Bartleby share in the process of
reading copy, the lawyer restructures the nature of how work
is performed--and assigned--inside his operation.
Predictably, the reactions of the other employees are over-
whelmingly negative. They range from expressions of frus-
tration to threats of violence. In spite of the fact that Turkey
and Nippers have received generous accommodations in the
workplace, neither employee supports the assignment of any
workplace accommodation to Bartleby. More importantly,
their discontent with the lawyer's willingness to do so threat-
ens the smooth functioning that the lawyer strives to main-
tain in his operation. Fueling their concerns is what scholars
in business identify as a perception of inherent unfairness:
Bartleby, the newest hire, is given different treatment at work
from other employees who have longer standing with the
company. As a result of their perception of such treatment of
Bartleby as being exceptional, these employees begin to
manifest what Adrienne Colella (2001) has described as spe-
cific attitudinal and behavioral reactions stemming from
their sense of inherent unfairness. Nippers, for example, is
candid in voicing his displeasure about being forced to "do
another man's business without pay" (Melville, 1853a, p.
551). For him, the solution to Bartleby's dysfunction is sim-
ple, "Kick him out of the office" (Melville, 1853a, p. 551).
This is a solution that not only removes the impediment to
the office's heretofore smooth functioning, but is also reflec-
tive of a sanctioned response to unproductive employees in
the larger work culture that exists outside this office. Indeed,
as the manager hangs fire and continues to debate how he
should proceed, the hostility of Nippers and Turkey to
Bartleby escalates and on a couple of occasions, rises to the
level of violence, with Nippers "grind[ing] out between his
set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stub-
born oaf behind the screen" (Melville, 1853a, p. 551) and
Turkey threatening to "step behind [Bartleby's] screen and
black his eyes for him" (Melville, 1853a, p. 552). The grow-
ing hostility of his employees to Bartleby contributes to a
greater urgency of a response from the lawyer who manages
the Chancery operation. In effect, the negative behaviors his
employees manifest have the potential to disrupt employee
commitment to the organization which, in turn, would have a
negative impact on overall performance and productivity.
Impact on the Manager
As the situation in the office escalates, the lawyer who runs it
becomes increasingly dysfunctional when it comes to incor-
porating Bartleby into his organization. Temperamentally, the
lawyer is conflict avoidant. This is perhaps why he has cho-
sen to focus exclusively on reproducing accurate copies of
legal documents, thereby avoiding the "turbulence" (Mitchell,
1990, p. 333) that is associated with work in a courtroom as a
trial lawyer. Before the arrival of Bartleby on the scene, the
lawyer, whom some critics view as being a man of limited
comprehension, has been able to rationalize his solutions to
tolerating both the disorder of his office and the eccentricities
of his employees by making rather extraordinary concessions
4 SAGE Open
to his two primary workers. The most notable of these con-
cessions is his willingness to let them put in half days of work
for a full day's pay. He also has set a precedent with them of
excusing careless errors that have the potential to imperil the
professional reputation of his office. One example of this is
his willingness to back down from a decision to fire Turkey
for mistakenly putting a ginger wafer in place of a seal onto a
legal document. However, these concessions have taken place
in secret, hidden from the eyes of colleagues and clients.
Moreover, they are obscured by the fact that his office does,
in spite of its inherent pathologies, get the work done both
well and expeditiously. However, as Bartleby, and in particu-
lar, his growing list of "preferences" for what he will and will
not do expands, the manager is confronted with a new prob-
lem: how to contain the growing resentment of his long-term
employees who see their employer's efforts to accommodate
Bartleby as extreme and unreasonable. While it is clear that
he has gone to extreme lengths in accommodating Turkey and
Nippers, it is also clear that his concessions to Bartleby have
actually engendered new problems within his organization. In
addition, his employees' responses to how he has proceeded
with Bartleby have complicated his own understanding of
what constitutes reasonable limits for one of his favorite man-
agement strategies. This is apparent in the lawyer's admission
that with Bartleby, he is offering "privileges and unheard of
exemptions," (Melville, 1853a, p. 554), a function, as he
acknowledges, of "that wondrous ascendancy which the
inscrutable scrivener had over me" (Melville, 1853b, p. 609).
Ultimately, however, even the process of creative accommo-
dation that has worked for him so well in the past is inade-
quate for dealing with Bartleby. Under no pretense can he
keep an employee who, as things escalate, prefers not to do
work of any kind and who will not take another job anywhere
else. Bartleby's presence in his office, where, ultimately, he
extends his preferences of not complying to requests made by
other residents in the building, imperils the lawyer's opera-
tion because it renders visible an employment conundrum
that the lawyer as the manager of this specific operation has
been unable to resolve. His inability to act decisively with
Bartleby highlights his failure as a manager and throws into
question the viability of the entire operation.
Impact on Workplace Discourse
The assigned roles and responsibilities characteristic of an
organization are manifest in the discourse that is employed
there, and it is in insisting on consistently functioning out-
side those discursive parameters that Bartleby presents the
greatest challenge to the organization. Workplace discourse
replicates organizational work practices and hierarchies.
From an ethnographic perspective, ready compliance with
the language practices in a workplace reveals the extent to
which employees are both trained in and accustomed to
speak within the discourse of their ruling institution.
Evaluating how an employee mediates these discursive
structures lends insight into how effectively they fit into the
organization's existing structures and hierarchies.
The other employees and workplace discourse.Turkey, Nip-
pers, and to a lesser extent, the office errand boy, Ginger Nut,
consistently function within the discursive parameters that
organize operations within the Office of the Chancery. When
asked to, these employees participate unquestioningly in
what their employer has described as the "common usages"
of the office, the most important of which is checking legal
copies for accuracy. The reiteration of the phrase "common
usages"--it appears three times in the story--underscores its
importance as a linguistic marker in the discourse of the law-
yer's operation. In addition, the use of the word "common"
suggests the extent to which this feature of the workplace is
seen as natural and normative,
as the way things are done and in some odd way as the only
way they could be done, rather than as planned procedures and
rules developed by individuals ensuring certain ideological
ways of interpreting and acting on a case. (DeVault & McCoy,
2006, p. 331)
The lawyer's deployment of this term "common usages"
serves an additional purpose when he is talking directly to
Bartleby. It not only reinscribes his identity as a member of
the legal system, but also suggests he is operating with care
and deliberation when it comes to his newest employee, lay-
ing out the terms of understanding of the requirements of the
job of scrivener, perhaps, as John Stark (1979) has suggested,
"as though he were protecting himself from legal liability" (p.
169). At the same time, the repetition of these terms in con-
versations with Bartleby functions as a means of introducing
him to the narrative terms of the official discourse that guides
operations within the office that now employs him.
So embedded are the other employees in the Chancery
office's work structures that when the lawyer turns to them
for validation that his request to Bartleby to check copies for
accuracy is a reasonable one, they form what Foucault (1978)
has described as a "moving substrate of force relations" (p.
93). Activated in response to a specific situation and repro-
duced within the discursive structures that inform their
understanding of how the organization functions, employer
and employees converge to form a line of force that at that
specific moment unites them in their opposition to what they
perceive as imperiling their shared operation. Employee
characterizations of Bartleby's actions as "quite out of the
common" (Melville, 1853a, p. 552) and "quite unusual"
(Melville, 1853a, p. 551) incorporate discursive elements
identical to those of the lawyer, evidence of the extent to
which their understanding of what is occurring inside the
office is actually mediated through his. This critical view of
Bartleby along with their unquestioning accession to what-
ever the lawyer asks them to do manifest what Liza McCoy
(2006) has characterized as a form of "intellectual vassalage"
Kelly 5
(p. 122). Accustomed to speaking and thinking within its rul-
ing discourse, the employees in the Office of the Chancery
not only share the lawyer's frustration with Bartleby's pref-
erence for what he will and will not do; their statements
about Bartleby's actions align them with his view of the way
work inside this office traditionally has been organized and is
to be performed. In advocating for Bartleby's termination
and dismissal from the firm, these employees likewise reveal
their endorsement and acceptance of standard employment
practice within the larger work community.
Workplace discourse and the manager. Gilles Deleuze (1998)
has noted that by stating that he would prefer not to acqui-
esce to the lawyer's varied requests, Bartleby presents a chal-
lenge to how work is done because his response contributes
a "new logic, a logic of preference" (p. 73) to the discourse
of the workplace. As Deleuze (1998) describes it, the for-
mula "I would prefer not to" creates a new exclusionary, one
that distances itself from everyone and everything in the
office. The lawyer's hope of bringing Bartleby back into
compliance with how his organization has and must operate
rests
on a logic of presuppositions according to which [he] . . .
"expects" to be obeyed or . . . listened to, whereas Bartleby has
invented a new logic, a logic of preference which is enough to
undermine the presuppositions as a whole. (Deleuze, 1998, p. 73)
Indeed, his consistent response to the various requests posed
to him by the lawyer that he would "prefer not to" constitutes
a language that is both new to the workplace and unprece-
dented, one for which there are no clear rules or directives on
how to operate or respond.As the narrator observes, Bartleby,
when delivering his response, is neither aggressive, nor
impertinent, nor confrontational, any one of which would
initiate a solution to his dilemma because they would consti-
tute clear grounds for dismissal. Instead, Bartleby's response
is fully transgressive because it is activated in response to
requests made in one realm while representing another. That
is, in using the phrase "I would prefer not to," Bartleby
responds to the request originated by the lawyer in a way that
simultaneously asserts his own visibility and avoids the pre-
ferred modality of how his employer desires to operate. His
statement stands in strict contraindication to the lawyer's
logical presupposition that within this organization, the
requests made by a manager regarding how the work process
is organized will be obeyed. Bartleby's response of consis-
tently refusing to engage in the way work is organized within
the office signals, linguistically, his outsider status because it
constitutes his attempt to maintain circulation in a discourse
that originates and ends with him. If, as Foucault has
observed, discursive production is productive of power and
the propagation of knowledge inside of organizational struc-
tures, then Bartleby's repetition of his statement regarding
his preferences in response to all the requests of the lawyer
also underscores his desire to maintain power within the lin-
guistic construction he himself engenders. Bartleby's utter-
ance of his preferences constitutes a narrative of resistance, a
form of "oppositional talk . . . that takes a stance that high-
lights the differences between the institutional discourse and
forms of knowing and being the speaker feels to be prefera-
ble . . ." (McCoy, 2006, p. 120). Such talk has the potential to
generate a critical perspective on the official narrative of
how the organization can and should function. The consistent
iteration of his preferring not to threatens the viability of the
lawyer's operation because of its potential to dismantle exist-
ing hierarchies within the Office of the Chancery, thereby
derailing the way the work of the organization is understood
to be performed.
The Search for Other Discursive
Realms to Address the Problem
Bartleby's insistence on maintaining an exclusionary status
by operating outside the formal parameters of the Office of
the Chancery destabilizes not only the work of that office but
also the confidence of the manager who runs it. Unable to
develop a strategy to contain this threat to his status within
the power relations of his organization, the lawyer manifests
behaviors that indicate he is becoming increasingly more
desperate and uncertain about how to act. Whitehead, Liese,
and O'Dell (1990) have noted that the narrator begins to
show signs of psychopathology when he assumes on a walk
to the office that everyone in the street is talking about him
and his odd relationship with Bartleby. This culminates in his
"panic flight" (Whitehead et al., 1990, p. 20) when he real-
izes the futility of all his efforts to get Bartleby to leave the
building. But perhaps the strongest evidence of the narrator's
desperation is revealed by the number of knowledge fields he
deploys in an attempt to understand, presumably to contain
and govern, his orthogonal employee. As Foucault (1978)
has noted, knowledge fields, like the law and medicine, per-
form discursive functions that both contain and construct
understandings. In the case of the narrator, these knowledge
fields range from the frivolous--the speculation that
Bartleby's behavior is due to a diet limited to ginger nuts--to
the medical--inability to discharge copy work because of
eyestrain brought on by overwork. He likewise invokes a
wide range of authorities, looking for direction in such var-
ied sources as the New Testament to philosophers, such as
Joseph Priestly, on predestination. The lawyer maneuvers at
rapid speed through this constantly evolving field of experts,
evidence of his dissatisfaction with the ability of any one of
them to resolve his dilemma on how to integrate Bartleby
more effectively into his organization. After reading Priestly,
for example, the lawyer becomes convinced that he was des-
tined to connect with Bartleby whom he views as sent by
God to make him a better human being. However, as pres-
sure from his colleagues in the legal profession mounts, the
6 SAGE Open
lawyer just as quickly abjures that position because it
becomes apparent that any display of loyalty to Bartleby has
the potential to imperil his livelihood and reputation.
Bartleby's continuing insistence on excluding himself from
the performance of work activities by preferring not to par-
ticipate in them destabilizes the coherence of the official nar-
rative that the lawyer has relied on to guide the relationships
and work assignments in his office. Destabilizing the official
narrative imperils the continuance of the organization.
Moreover, none of the knowledge systems he deploys,
whether medical, theological, or philosophical, provides the
lawyer with guidance on how to construct an organization
that reconciles his desire to secure a comfortable life and the
esteem of his employees with Bartleby as part of the opera-
tion. The lawyer's maneuvering at rapid speed through a
wide and varied realm of discursive fields not only illustrates
the destabilizing effect Bartleby has had on the organiza-
tion's operation, it is also evidence of the lawyer's despera-
tion to find a way to find an organizational structure that will
allow him to continue to accommodate all of his employees
while yet maintaining the steady output of product necessary
for the organization to continue.
Why Legal Discourse Is an Effective Solution
The solution to the Bartleby "problem" comes from the land-
lord of the building that houses the lawyer's operation. The
landlord's organization is comprised of a number of lucrative
rental spaces in this building. His ability to attract and retain
renters is compromised by the dysfunction within one of his
rental units. To save his operation, which is his primary and
only concern, the landlord gets the court to arrest Bartleby on
charges of vagrancy, an action that results in his removal
from the premises and consignment to prison at the Tombs.
Although the lawyer debates whether the legal term "vagrant"
was even appropriate for someone who essentially inhabited
a single building, and who, in fact, had managed to support
himself, he complies with the legal decision, unwilling, as
per usual, to make waves. The conviction and consignment
of Bartleby to prison provides closure to a problem that the
narrator and the larger society within which he operates
faced: They now have a term whereby they can contain--and
delimit--a Bartleby as well as a mechanism for initiating a
line of action that will ensure his erasure as an impediment to
work operations in the building. The law represents a sanc-
tioned form of discourse, one which directs a specific course
of action. The use of the term "vagrant" to describe Bartleby
effectually displaces him from the context of one cultural
space and repositions him inside another, one with its own
constitutive structures.
Bartleby's arrest proves a boon for the lawyer on many
levels. For one thing, it insures that the organizational struc-
ture that had proven so successful to work activity in the
office can resume, in large part because of the removal of the
one impediment to its implementation. Bartleby's removal
from the Office of the Chancery likewise contributes to the
reauthorization of the discourse of that workplace, an action
that is not only essential to directing how that work is to be
performed but also to clarifying and structuring the power
relations essential to facilitating its operation. Indeed, per-
haps the greatest threat Bartleby posed to the lawyer's opera-
tion was in this area. The growing frequency with which the
other employees in the Office of Chancery begin to use the
term "prefer" in their conversations manifests not only the
facility with which that term has become incorporated into
the discourse of the workplace but also its potential to upend
and transform the organizational structures within which the
scriveners have traditionally operated. The term "prefer" is,
as Friedman (1966) suggests, constitutive of an alternative of
how business operations generally occur, as linguistically, it
represents a
strange reversal of situation that allows the employee rather than
the employer to stipulate the terms of work, especially when this
stipulation is not based on any contractual agreement or mutual
bargaining but upon an entirely unexplained and undefended "I
prefer not to." (p. 67)
Bartleby's removal from the office, facilitated by the deploy-
ment of the legal charge that he is a vagrant, insures that his
favored response will likewise disappear with him, thereby
neutralizing its potency in narrative terms of an official dis-
course for guiding work activities within the lawyer's
operation.
The Lawyer' Fate: Fallout From a
Failure to Act Decisively
Ultimately, even the removal of Bartleby from his office is
not enough to prevent the lawyer's professional downfall. At
the end of Melville's story, he reveals that he has lost his posi-
tion in the Office of the Chancery, a position that he had
counted on as a lifetime appointment. Ironically, his fate mir-
rors that of his orthogonal employee. Like Bartleby who came
to the lawyer's operation after losing his clerkship in the Dead
Letter Office in Washington because of "a change in the
administration" (Melville, 1853b, p. 614), the narrator has
likewise lost his position as Master of Chancery because of a
change in the state of New York's Constitution. Like Bartleby,
then, the lawyer experiences firsthand what it is to be a subor-
dinate within the moving substrate that characterizes all
exchanges of power. In falling from favor, the lawyer has
direct experience of the conditionality and the fragility that
characterize all subordinative relationships. Indeed, given the
lawyer's turn from personal growth in caring for Bartleby to
concern for his own survival, perhaps the message of the
story is one which concerns the fragile presumption on which
all relationships, both inside and outside the office, ultimately
rest. At the same time, "Bartleby the Scrivener" is powerful
testimony to the threat inherent in simple declarations and to
Kelly 7
the potential they have to upend and destabilize the coherence
of official narratives that guide and organize sequences of
action inside of ruling institutions.
Conclusion
The use of methodology from the social sciences, in particu-
lar, the application of methods used by institutional ethnog-
raphers to the analysis of the office setting in Herman
Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener," provides a useful tool
for identifying and analyzing the nature of power relations
within the organization that is the setting of the story. It also
provides a mechanism with which to identify how employ-
ees working within that environment mediate and negotiate
its structure. At the same time, by making central to its meth-
odology the voice of participants within the organization, an
ethnographic approach contributes to an understanding of
the role played by the discursive constructions that structure
and organize work activities within such institutions as well
as the roles and relationships that result as individuals func-
tion within those organizational structures and discursive
constructions. As the narrative of Bartleby suggests, success
in the Office of Chancery is manifested by a consistent and
unreflective response to a specific sanctioned form of dis-
course, in this case, an uncontested agreement to read docu-
ments for errors. Bartleby's continuing insistence on
preferring not to do this as well as other work activities
deemed essential to the success of this organization, under-
scores his outsider status as reflected in this dominant discur-
sive paradigm, just as, over time, its unconscious insertion
into the casual conversations of the other employees in the
Chancery office signals its potential to dismantle the terms of
understanding on which the business must operate to be suc-
cessful. Indeed, as the concerted effort to remove him from
the Chancery office suggests, his behaviors, in particular, his
utterance of a preference that is so at odds with the expecta-
tion for how employees are to perform their work functions
within the office's existing organizational hierarchies is pow-
erful testimony to the threat inherent in simple declarations
and to the potential they have to upend and destabilize the
coherence of official narratives that guide and organize
sequences of action inside of ruling institutions.
An ethnographic approach to Herman Melville's short
story, "Bartleby the Scrivener," also opens up new under-
standings of the office setting that is at the heart of the story.
It helps readers understand why the office, a site of social
organization, adopts specific structures as crucial to its func-
tioning. It also deepens an awareness of how roles and hier-
archies within the organization are consequences of those
choices. Ethnography also provides tools for identifying and
evaluating linguistic markers of an individual's positioning
within organizational structures. In doing so, it provides a
theoretical context within which to understand the signifi-
cance to the organization that Bartleby's linguistic mantra of
consistently preferring not to represents.At the same time, an
ethnographic reading of Melville's story provides a mecha-
nism for identifying the larger institutional process at work
in Melville's story, one that contributes to the reproduction of
a system of social relations in the workplace that requires
subordination and compliance to insure its success.
As this discussion of "Bartleby the Scrivener" suggests,
the application of social science methods can be a useful tool
for literary analysis. Characters in fiction occupy many orga-
nizational spaces, from law courts and tribal structures to
medical and military institutions. The tools provided by eth-
nographic institutional methodologies can be useful in open-
ing up an understanding not only of how these organizations
are structured but also of how those structures determine
how the characters in those literary landscapes inhabit orga-
nizational spaces and come to operate there.
