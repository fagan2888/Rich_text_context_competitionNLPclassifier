Sturm und Drang in Money Market Funds:
When Money Market Funds Cease to Be Narrow 
Stephan Jank and Michael Wedow 
Abstract
This paper investigates the returns and flows of German money mar-
ket funds before and during the liquidity crisis of 2007/2008. The main
findings of this paper are: In liquid times money market funds enhanced
their returns by investing in less liquid papers. By doing so they outper-
formed other funds as long as liquidity in the market was high. Investing
in less liquid assets, however, widens the narrow structure of money mar-
ket funds and makes them vulnerable to runs. During the shortening of
liquidity caused by the subprime crisis illiquid funds experienced runs,
while more liquid funds functioned as a safe haven.

Non-technical summary
Money market funds (MMFs) are normally seen as an extremely safe invest-
ment, because they only invest in short-term, high-grade debt. Nevertheless,
during the subprime crisis of 2007/2008 German money market funds faced
severe outflows and falling returns. In this paper we investigate the reasons be-
hind these developments and contribute to our understanding of the stability
of financial intermediaries. The sample we are using includes all German retail
MMFs starting in 1996 until the first half of 2008. Our results suggest that in
a competitive environment, where investors react to good or bad performance,
MMFs' managers have an incentive to invest in riskier assets in order to en-
hance their performance. The narrow structure of MMFs is thereby diluted
and the probability of a run on the fund increases.
First, we look at persistence of money market funds' returns i.e. if the per-
formance ranking of money market funds is repeated over subsequent years.
Positive evidence for persistence permits a first inference on the reasons be-
hind money market returns. Our main finding is that even though returns are
overall persistent there are some periods that do not show persistence. Most
importantly, the winning funds of 2006 (before the liquidity crisis) are the los-
ing funds of 2007 (in the liquidity crisis) and vice versa. This provides a first
indication of the impact of market liquidity for the returns of money market
funds.
Second, we examine the causes for persistence in returns. We find that two
factors drive persistence: expenses and portfolio liquidity. Thus, money mar-
ket funds can enhance their returns by investing in less liquid assets. By doing
so money market funds with less liquid portfolios can outperform more liquid
funds. Sufficient market liquidity ensures that funds with less liquid portfolios
can sell assets at any time. The long period of high market liquidity from 2002
to 2006 enabled illiquid funds to outperform persistently. The liquidity crisis
of 2007, however, led to a reversal of performance. Funds with a less liquid
portfolio were at a disadvantage due to the decline in market liquidity
Third, this article investigates flows into and out of MMFs. We find a sig-
nificant flow-performance relationship, meaning that investors withdraw their
money from funds that underperform and invest in funds that outperform. In
times of low market liquidity people withdraw their money from less liquid
funds and we observe run-like phenomenons. Liquid funds, on the other hand,
show no significant outflows and continue to function as a safe haven.
Our results are subject to caveats. Credit as well as interest rate risk may
also be behind our evidence. However, data limitations do not allow us any
analysis of these aspects. Interest rate should play a limited role given the
assets typically have a very short maturity. The developments during the sub-
prime crisis have shown that previously save securities exhibited substantially
larger credit risk and may thus also be present in MMFs. Also credit and
liquidity risk are difficult to disentangle during times of market turmoil.

In einem ersten Schritt untersuchen wir, ob die Renditen der Geldmarkt-

uber mehrere Jahre erkennbar ist. Wir
zeigen, dass Renditen zwar persistent sind, dass die Persistenz in einigen Zeit-

1 Introduction
Money market funds (MMFs) are normally seen as an extremely safe invest-
ment, because they only invest in short-term, high-grade debt. For this reason,
MMFs should only have a minimum exposure to interest rate, credit or liquid-
ity risk. Nevertheless, during the subprime crisis of 2007/2008 German money
market funds faced severe outflows and falling returns. The aim of this paper
is to investigate the reasons for the crisis of German money market funds.
Open-end mutual funds in general, similarly to banks, offer demand de-
posit contracts, meaning that investors can withdraw their money at any
time. Withdrawals, however, impose a negative externality on the remain-
ing investors in the fund (e.g. Edelen 1999, Nanda, Narayanan & Warther
2000). This is because facing outflows fund managers have to sell their assets
at an unfavorable time. The expectation that other investors will withdraw
their money can lead the remaining investors to follow, and can result in a
panic-based run (Diamond & Dybvig 1983, Goldstein & Pauzner 2005, Chen,
Goldstein & Jiang 2007). The likelihood of such a run increases if the negative
externality increases. Therefore, runs are more likely in illiquid funds than in
liquid funds.
Given that money market funds only invest in short-term, high grade debt,
runs used to be considered as unlikely. Money market funds close the matu-
rity gap that makes banks vulnerable to runs. By doing so MMFs can provide
liquidity services without needing a socially costly deposit insurance. MMFs
are therefore often considered to be "narrow banks".
This alternative form of liquidity provision is growing not only in the United
States, but also in other countries. Since the first MMF was established in the
US in the 70s, assets have grown to a total of USD 4,957 billion in 2007 world-
wide. Overall, money market funds account for over 19% of all mutual fund
assets in the world, which makes them the second largest group after equity
funds.1 The growing relevance of MMFs as financial intermediaries makes it
important to investigate whether MMFs are indeed immune to runs in times
of financial turmoil.

In this article we use a panel of German retail MMFs and analyze their
returns and flows before and during the shortening of liquidity which started
with the US subprime crisis. First, we look at persistence of money market
funds' returns. The performance of MMFs is usually highly persistent and
mostly driven by the expense ratio. Our main finding is that even though
returns are overall persistent there are some periods that do not show persis-
tence. Most importantly, the winning funds of 2006 (before the liquidity crisis)
are the losing funds of 2007 (in the liquidity crisis) and vice versa. Second, we
examine the causes for persistence in returns. We find that not only expenses
but also the portfolio structure drive performance persistence. While money
market funds that invest in illiquid assets outperform during liquid times they
underperform in illiquid times. Third, we investigate the flows into and out of
MMFs. There exists a significant performance-flow relationship, meaning that
investors withdraw their money from funds that underperform and invest in
funds that outperform. In times of extreme illiquidity people withdraw their
money from less liquid funds and we observe run-like phenomenons. Liquid
funds, on the other hand, show no significant outflows and continue to function
as a safe haven.
The results of this paper contribute to our understanding of the stability
of financial intermediaries. Our results suggest that in a competitive environ-
ment, where investors react to good or bad performance, MMFs' managers
have an incentive ("Drang": drive, impulse, urge) to invest in riskier assets in
order to enhance their performance. The narrow structure of MMFs is thereby
widened and the probability of a run (ger.: "Sturm") on the fund increases.
2 Related Literature
This article refers to several strands of literature: Persistence of MMFs' re-
turns is a well known fact in the literature and documented by several studies
(e.g. Domian & Reichenstein 1998, Christoffersen & Musto 2002, Dahlquist,
Engstr¨
om & S¨
oderlind 2000). Performance persistence of MMFs is generally
attributed to the strong persistence of expense ratios. Domian & Reichen-
stein (1998) find that expense ratio plus a dummy variable indicating whether
a fund exclusively invests in government securities explain 87% of the cross
sectional difference in net returns. They conclude that MMFs are a financial
2
commodity and best selected by the lowest expense ratio.
A logical question that follows is, how can in an competitive environment
funds with high and low expense ratios coexist? Christoffersen & Musto (2002)
argue that fund managers can charge different prices to their investors, because
they face different demand curves. In particular, investors differ in their sensi-
tivity to management fees. Therefore, fund managers are able to charge higher
expense ratios without losing all existing investors. This allows some MMFs'
managers to persistently have higher expense ratios and to underperform other
funds.
Using a non-parametric method proposed by Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbot-
son & Ross (1992) we are able to have a disaggregate view on performance
persistence of MMFs. Even though persistence in our sample is very strong
and present in the majority of years we also find that several years show no
persistence and a reversal in performance from one year to another. The per-
sistence of expense ratios is not able to explain years without persistence or
a reversal in performance. This result suggests that an additional factor is
driving MMFs' return persistence.
Other studies argue that MMFs are not a mere commodity meaning that
fund expenses are not the only determinant of returns. Koppenhaver (1999)
shows in a cross-sectional regression that in addition to expenses also other
portfolio characteristics affect returns. The share of agency securities and
commercial papers is assumed to be a proxy for credit risk and has a positive
effect on returns. Further, a higher weighted average maturity results in a
higher return. In this sense, fund managers can offset the annual expenses and
enhance returns by increasing credit or interest rate risk.
We follow this line of argument and investigate how money market fund
managers can enhance their returns by investing in less liquid assets. This
paper contributes to the literature above in showing that the impact of liq-
uid assets is not constant over time but varies as a function of market-wide
liquidity: money market funds with illiquid assets outperform in liquid times
but underperform in illiquid times (See Acharya & Pedersen 2005, Massa &
Phalippou 2005).2
2We primarily relate the performance of MMFs to liquidity risk and not to credit and
3
There exists a large literature on the negative effect of outflows on the
remaining investors in the fund (e.g. Chordia 1996, Nanda, Narayanan &
Warther 2000, Edelen 1999). Redemptions create costs, which include for
example liquidity-based trading, price impact and commissions. In addition,
the fund might be forced to deviate from its desired portfolio also resulting
into costs. Therefore, fund managers set front- and back-end fees to dissuade
redemptions and investors self-select themselves into a fund according to their
liquidity needs (e.g. Chordia 1996). Since it usually takes some days for the
fund manager to restore her cash balance, the costs of redemptions affect
mainly the remaining investors in the fund. For this reason, withdrawals im-
pose a negative externality on the remaining investors.
Chen, Goldstein & Jiang (2007) consider this negative externality in the
context of strategic complementarities in mutual funds. In the framework of
global games they are able to develop testable predictions about runs (Carlsson
& van Damme 1993, Goldstein & Pauzner 2005). The expectation that other
investors will withdraw their money can cause further investors to withdraw
their money, resulting in a "self-fulfilling run". Since the negative external-
ity increases with the illiquidity of the fund, illiquid funds are more likely to
experience runs than liquid funds. Chen et al. (2007) argue further that the ex-
ternality caused by withdrawals can be internalized if the number of investors
is small enough. This article shows that strategic complementarities can even
exist in relatively liquid sector of money market funds.
Finally, this article contributes to the literature concerned with the financial
stability of narrow banking. Banks finance short-term deposits with long-term
credits. This maturity intermediation makes banks vulnerable to runs (Dia-
mond & Dybvig 1983). One remedy to avoid bank runs is to insure deposits
and thereby establish trust in the bank. Deposit insurance, however, comes at
a cost: it can lead to moral hazard because managers, insured against a bank
run, may invest in riskier assets. A possible solution to this dilemma is the
so called narrow banking approach (Gorton & Pennacchi 1992, Miller 1998).
Since the key problem of bank runs is the maturity gap narrow banking sug-
other risks. MMFs typically invest in high grade assets which exhibit limited credit risk.
However, the sudden and rapid downgrade of various asset classes during the subprime crisis
uncovered previously unexpected credit risks. However, disentangling credit from liquidity
risk is difficult given that particularly in times of market wide distress they go hand in hand.
4
gests to reduce or eliminate this gap. The narrow banking approach proposes
that the two main functions of a bank, the deposit taking and lending function,
should be separated into two firms. Instead of financing demand deposits with
long term obligations narrow banks should be financed with short-term, high-
quality securities. In theory, the reduction of the maturity gap would make
narrow banks immune to bank runs and a (socially) costly deposit insurance
would not be needed. In practice, money market funds are often considered
to be a form of narrow banking. MMFs provide liquidity services to their
investors by investing exclusively in high-grade debt with short maturity and
the deposits are, in contrast to banks, not insured.
There are a number of papers that investigate whether MMFs are indeed
immune against liquidity or credit shocks. Gorton & Pennacchi (1992) analyze
in an event study, how a default in the commercial paper market affects the
commercial paper spread and if this leads to withdrawals from money market
funds. Their main result is that an individual commercial paper default has no
significant impact on the commercial paper spread and does not result in a run
on MMFs. In a similar study Miles (2001) compares the response of MMFs
and commercial banks to monetary shocks. He finds that money market funds
have no difficulties withstanding a monetary shock.
More recently, a debate evolved around the question if commercial banks
have an advantage in hedging liquidity risk in comparison to other financial
intermediaries such as MMFs. Gatev & Strahan (2006) argue that the ad-
vantage of commercial banks to hedge against liquidity risk originates from
the fact that flows into banks co-vary with market illiquidity. In other words,
following an illiquidity shock commercial banks experience inflows instead of
outflows. Pennacchi (2006), however, finds a similar result for MMFs. Using
vector autoregression (VAR) he finds that after a liquidity shock MMFs ex-
perience inflows and the dimension of these inflows is similar to those of large
commercial banks.
This article contributes to the studies investigating financial stability of
MMFs in two important ways: First, we use individual money market funds
instead of aggregate data. Second, we investigate the stability of MMFs against
liquidity shocks for a non-US sample. This permits us to gain insight, how the
concept of MMFs works under a different regulatory setting.
5
3 Institutional Background
There are several differences between US and German money market funds. In
this section we discuss the most important differences and their implications
for the stability of MMFs.
While money market funds have existed for quite some time in the United
States, they are fairly new in Germany and were only introduced in the mid
nineties. As a consequence money market funds play only a minor role in the
financial system of Germany. In the United States money market funds ac-
count for 25.8 % of all mutual fund assets. In comparison, in Germany money
market funds represent only for 7.6 % of all mutual fund assets.3
The majority of US money market funds have a constant net asset value
(CNAV) meaning that the value of one share, usually one dollar, remains
unchanged. Income is reflected in an increase of the number of shares. In
Germany MMFs have an accumulating net asset value (ANAV), meaning that
they are priced market-to-market. Income of the fund is directly reflected by
an increase of the share value. Gorton & Pennacchi (1992) argue that the
popularity of constant net asset value in the US is mostly due to a simplified
tax treatment.
To maintain a fixed asset value American MMFs use the so called amor-
tized cost valuation. This method can lead to arbitrage possibilities, when
the valuation method deviates from the market-to-market value. For further
details on the method and the magnitude of arbitrage see Lyon (1984). If the
market price decreases and the amortized cost valuation overprices the share
value substantially there is an incentive for investors to withdraw their money.
In this sense, a fixed net asset value makes MMFs more vulnerable to runs. On
the other hand, market discipline forces MMFs with constant net asset value
to reduce the risk of their portfolio.
In both the US and Germany MMFs have to invest in securities with a

maximum maturity of one year. In the US the weighted average maturity of
a money market fund is not allowed to exceed 90 days. This regulation was
introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1991 in an
effort to increase stability of MMFs (Gorton & Pennacchi 1992). Unlike the
US there is no regulation concerning the average maturity of German MMFs.
Probably the most important difference between US and German money
market funds is that US MMFs are subject to an implicit insurance. Issuers
of money fund promise to never "break the buck". This means that the fund
issuer guarantees that the value will never fall below one dollar. Hence, an in-
vestor can be sure to get at least the money back she invested. This is no legal
obligation, but historically the sponsoring organizations have bailed out their
money market funds in trouble (Gup 1998). Bailouts of US money market
funds have also taken place during the subprime mortgage crisis. In the course
of the subprime crisis at least 17 financial companies have bought low-valued
securities from their MMFs to avoid a negative return.4 German issuers of
money market funds do not provide an insurance for their funds or at least do
not announce it a-priori. The lack of an implicit insurance increases investor
uncertainty which may ultimately contribute to runs.
4 Empirical Analysis
4.1 Data and Descriptive Statistics
Our sample contains a survivorship bias free sample of all German retail money
market funds.5 In order to make funds comparable we only consider MMFs
which invest in Euro denominated securities. Our main data source is the
monthly capital market statistic (Kapitalmarktstatistik) of the Deutsche Bun-
desbank. Further, data on the monthly returns was obtained from Thomson
Financial Datastream and data on the annual expense ratios originates from
the German Federal Association of Investment Companies (Bundesverband
Deutscher Investmentgesellschaften, BVI).
Returns are calculated assuming that dividends are reinvested immediately.
4See The New York Times, July 11, 2008, p.8
5There are a number of MMFs registered in Luxembourg and marketed in Germany.
Unfortunately, we do not have any data on these funds.

Bubill Return
The figure shows the monthly (annualized) return of an equally
weighted portfolio of German retail money market funds (MMFs)
in comparison to a German government bill (Bubill) maturing in
3 months.
Figure 1 displays the annualized returns of German MMFs in comparison to
the return of a 3-month German treasury bill (Bubill) in the period 1996/01
- 2008/06. The returns of MMFs follow usually closely the returns of short-
term government securities. During the subprime crisis, however, we observe
a sharp drop in the mean MMFs' return.
Figure 1 highlights that the 3-month Bubill rate can serve as a natural
benchmark to compare the performance of MMFs. Therefore, we calculate
excess returns by subtracting the 3-month Bubill rate from the funds' net re-
turns. Other studies (e.g. Dahlquist et al. 2000, Christoffersen & Musto 2002)
use a relative benchmark (i.e. an index of all money market funds) to compare
the performance of MMFs. Since the average performance of MMFs dropped
sharply during the second half of 2007 using a relative benchmark is not ade-
quate for our purposes.

Table 1: Summary Statistics
This table shows summary statistics to the fund specific variables. Excess return is the
annualized net return minus the 3-month Bubill rate in percentage points. Relative net
flows are inflows minus outflows in relation to total assets (in percent). Commercial papers
are defined as short term securities issued at a discount from financial and non-financial
issuers. Treasury bills include all European government securities. Debt securities are
all securities that are neither commercial papers nor treasury securities. Debt securities
include floating and fixed rate securities and also asset-backed securities. All asset classes
are measured as share of total assets. Age is measured in years since inception. Size is
the log of total net assets. Expense ratio is the operating expenses divided by the average
assets under management. Data sources are Thomson Financial Datastream, the capital
market statistic of the Deutsche Bundesbank (BBK) and the German Federal Association

The mean excess return is -46.3 basis points (See Table 1). A negative
average excess return is at first sight surprising, but MMFs generally earn
less than short term treasury securities and more than insured bank deposits
(Koppenhaver & Sapp 2005). This is due to management fees which are nec-
essary to run the fund. The investor values these intermediary services such
as diversification, active maturity management and liquidity services, that she
is willing to pay the fees instead of directly investing in treasury securities.6
Figure 2 displays the median, 25th and 75th percentile of MMFs' excess
returns in the period 1996/01 - 2008/06. The figure shows that the median
money market fund generally underperforms a 3-month Bubill. However, there
are funds that outperform other funds and achieve a return equal or higher

than the treasury security return. Starting in the second half of 2007 we ob-
serve a drop in median excess return. But funds are not equally affected by the
crisis. While some funds' performance drops considerably other funds manage
to achieve a return at or above the benchmark. It also can be seen that some
funds dropped below zero percent return, meaning that investors actually faced
negative returns.

rate securities and also asset-backed securities. Further, bank deposits play an
important but declining role for MMFs.
As can be seen in Table 2 MMFs increased their share of debt securities
continuously until 2006 up to 81%. Supposably, they did so because these
assets earned a higher return than alternative assets (i.e. bank deposits or
commercial papers). With the start of the liquidity crisis in 2007 total net
assets decreased by an amount of around 10 billion Euro, which accounts for a
third of all MMFs assets under management (See also Figure 3). In the crisis
MMFs reduced their share of debt securities and increased the share of more
secure assets such as commercial papers or bank deposits.
The capital market statistic enables us to directly observe inflows and out-
flows. We therefore calculate the relative net flows the following way:

Figure 4: Flows of Money Market Funds
The figure shows in, out and net flows (in Mio. Euro) of German
retail MMFs over time.
Aggregate in, out and net flows are displayed in Figure 4. During the 2007/2008
liquidity crisis we observe increased outflows and a reduction in net flows. Note,
that MMFs also experienced outflows in earlier periods, for example during the
year 2004. These outflows, however, did not have a negative impact on the
returns, supposably because the money market was relatively liquid at that
time. Such outflows could have been motivated by the low absolute return of
MMFs at that time or by other more attractive investment opportunities.
We approximate aggregate money market liquidity by the spread between
the 6-month Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and the 6-month Bubill
rate. The spread between interbank loans and government bonds can gener-
ally be assigned to both credit or liquidity risk. We follow Grinblatt (2001),
who argues that an interbank loan is essentially risk free and the spread be-
tween the two assets has to be attributed to their differences in liquidity. An
interbank loan is rather illiquid, because it cannot easily be converted back.
A government bond, on the other hand, can more easily be sold before it ma-
tures. The difference in return between interbank rate and government bonds

is therefore referred to as convenience yield. Recent empirical studies (e.g.
Fontaine & Garcia 2007, Feldh¨
utter & Lando 2007) find that the majority of
this money market spread can be attributed to a liquidity premium.
Figure 5 shows the spread between the 6-month Euribor and the 6-month
Bubill rate for the period 1999/01 - 2008/06.7 In the period of 2001 until
the first half of 2007 the money market experienced a time of relatively high
liquidity. With the beginning of the second half of 2007 we observe an increase
in money market spread of more than 60 basis points.
7Since the Euribor was only established in 1999 we will only use the reduced sample in
our further investigation.

4.2 Persistence of Returns
Money market funds' returns generally show a strong persistence, which has
been documented in several studies (Domian & Reichenstein 1998, Christof-
fersen & Musto 2002, Dahlquist et al. 2000). We estimate the first-order auto-
correlation of annual returns using the Fama-MacBeth method. The autocor-
relation coefficient is 0.54 and significantly different from zero (See Table 3).8
We therefore reject the the null hypothesis that past performance is unrelated
to future performance. Persistence also holds for several sub-samples, however,
in the sub-sample including the crisis year 2007 significance weakens.
In addition, we employ a non-parametric method, suggested by Brown et al.
(1992) and Brown & Goetzmann (1995), to measure performance persistence.
This method allows us to obtain a disaggregate view on persistence. In a
first step, we separate for each year the sample into winning and losing funds.
Winners are defined as funds which are above the median return and losers
are smaller or equal the median return. In a second step, we consider repeated
winners and losers. Winner-Winner (WW) denotes funds that were winners
in the last year and are also winners in the current year. In the same way
further groups are established: Loser-Loser (LL), Winner-Loser (WL) and
Loser-Winner (LW). Table 4 shows the contingency tables for each year. It
further reports the number of new funds in the sample and the funds that drop
out of the sample.9 We also distinguish whether the fund was a winning fund
the period before dropping out (Winner-Gone) or a losing fund (Loser-Gone).
For each year we calculate the odds-ratio (OR):
OR = (WW · LL)/(WL · LW) (2)
Under the null hypothesis that performance in the previous year is unrelated to
the performance of the current year the odds-ratio equals one. The logarithm
8For details on the estimation method see Grinblatt & Titman (1992) or Horst & Verbeek
(2000)
9The difference in the number of funds in comparison to Table 2 originates from the fact
that a fund has to exist for two whole calender years.

regression of lagged return on return and average the coefficients

two sub-samples. Fama-MacBeth standard errors are given in
parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%

Table 4 summarizes the results. In the majority of years, seven out of eleven
times, we reject the null hypothesis of independence on a 10% significance
level. This means that in the majority of years the winners of last year are
also the winners of the current year.
To assess the overall significance we employ Pearson's p
-Test (e.g. Rao
1952, p.44). Under the null hypothesis the p-values pi

ual tests are equally distributed on the [0,1] interval. It follows that  =

of independence on conventional significance levels. This is in line with the
results found in the Fama-MacBeth regression (See Table 3).
Both the parametric an non-parametric method give us strong evidence for
overall performance persistence. The advantage of contingency tables is that
we are able to disaggregate the test and investigate persistence period by period
(Brown et al. 1992). In the years of extremely high market liquidity (2002-
2006) performance persistence is high. In the year 2005 there are 18 winning
funds. 16 out of these 18 winning funds are also winners in the year 2006.
In contrast to this we find a reversal in outperformance during the subprime
crisis: Most winners of 2006, a year of extremely high market liquidity, are
losers in 2007, a year of extremely low market liquidity.
This result suggests that outperformance of money market funds is a group
phenomenon depending on market-wide liquidity as a state variable. In the
next section we will investigate more closely the determinants of performance
persistence in money market funds.

to present winners by calculating the odds-ratio: (Winner-Winner · Loser-Loser)/(Winner-Loser · Loser-Winner). An odds-ratio of
1 corresponds to independence. To evaluate the overall rejection/acceptance of the null hypothesis we report Pearson's p-Test

4.3 Outperformance and Liquidity Risk
The persistence of fund returns is generally attributed to the strong persis-
tence of expense ratios (See e.g. Domian & Reichenstein 1998, Christoffersen
& Musto 2002). Since investors face costs when switching from one fund to
another fund managers are able to charge higher fees without loosing existing
investors. For this reason, some funds can persistently underperform others
without loosing their investors.
The year by year inspection of performance persistence showed clearly that
persistence is not common in all years. There are years without persistence and
most notably a reversal in performance from the year 2006 to 2007. This hap-
pened without a change in expense ratios. Therefore the expense ratio alone
cannot be the sole explanation for performance and persistence of MMFs.
Koppenhaver (1999) finds that in addition to expenses the portfolio compo-
sition also determines MMFs' returns. Fund managers can therefore enhance
their returns by increasing the riskiness of the portfolio. In this line of argu-
ment we want to analyze the cross-sectional differences of money market fund
returns with respect to the liquidity of their portfolio. We therefore run the
following cross-sectional regression for each month:
Exc. Returnit
= 0
+ 1
Liq. Assetsi,t-1
+ (4)
2
Sizei,t-1
+ 3
Expense Ratioi
+ i,t
,
where Liq. Assetsi,t-1
is the share of treasury securities, bank deposits and
commercial papers. These traditional money market instruments are arguably
the most liquid assets in the portfolio of a money market fund. Most impor-
tantly, this share does not include asset-backed securities which bear a higher
liquidity risk because the market has only recently been established in Europe.
To account for possible economics of scale we include Sizei,t-1
, the logarithm
of total assets of the fund (Domian & Reichenstein 1998). Further we include
the Expense Ratioi
of the fund as a control, which is the average expense ratio
of the fund.11
11Taking the average for each fund is justified by the fact that expense ratios do almost
not vary over time in our sample. The main part of the overall variation (standard deviation:
0.194) can be attributed to cross sectional variation (standard deviation: 0.183).
19
This regression is similar to the one of Koppenhaver (1999), but we extend
this regression by taking into account that the relationship between portfolio
and return may vary over time as a function of market-wide liquidity. Acharya
& Pedersen (2005) report that liquid assets have superior performance in illiq-
uid times and inferior performance in liquid times. We follow Massa & Phalip-
pou (2005) who argue that the relationship of portfolio liquidity and perfor-
mance varies over time as a function of market-wide liquidity. This leads to
our first testable hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Funds that hold illiquid assets outperform in liquid
times and underperform in illiquid times.
To test this hypothesis we run the cross-sectional regression displayed in
equation 4 for each month. Afterward, we sort the months by market-wide
liquidity into four quartiles and average the coefficients for each of the four
groups. The results of this Fama-MacBeth regression are displayed in Table 5.
The impact of liquid assets varies across the four quartiles. In the most liq-
uid months (1st quartile) the share of liquid assets has a negative impact on
performance. The negative impact of liquid assets on performance decreases
for the less liquid assets (2nd and 3rd quartile). In times of extreme illiquidity
(4th quartile) liquid assets even have a positive impact on excess return. We
find no evidence for economics of scale.
For robustness and to better measure how market illiquidity and portfo-
lio liquidity interact we run the following fixed effects regression displayed in
equation 5. We now ask the question how a specific money fund manager can
enhance her return by changing the portfolio. Using fixed effects we account
for possible endogeneity that might result from a correlation of unobserved
fund specific attributes with the regressors. The empirical model is specified
as follows:

is, as mentioned before, the share of traditional money
market instruments (i.e. bank deposits, treasury securities and commercial
papers). The share of liquid assets enters directly and in interaction with our
measure for market illiquidity Spreadt
into the regression equation. Hypoth-
esis 1 suggests a negative 1
: in very liquid times liquid assets should have a
negative impact on performance. It also follows from hypothesis 1, that the
coefficient of the interaction term 3
is positive: in illiquid times liquid assets
should have a positive effect on performance.

considering market illiquidity for two different samples: the sample before the
liquidity crisis on the money market (1999-2006) and the full sample (1999-
2008). Results can be found in columns (1) and (3). It becomes obvious, that
omitting market illiquidity, is problematic. In the first sample period liquid
assets have a negative impact on returns. This first period was characterized
by relative high market liquidity as can be seen in Figure 5. In the full sample
liquid assets do have a positive impact. This is at first sight counterintuitive,
however, driven by the extreme market illiquidity since the middle of 2007.
Controlling for market liquidity is apparently important.
The results of the fully specified model can be found in column (2) and
(4). The coefficient of Liq. Assetsi,t-1
1
is, as hypothesized, negative: funds
with liquid assets underperform in liquid times. Liquid funds, however, out-
22
perform in illiquid times. The interaction coefficient with market illiquidity 3
is significantly different from zero and positive. Including market-wide liquid-
ity directly and as an interaction term also increases the model's explanatory
power measured by the within R2 considerably. The pre-crisis sample (1999-
2006) shows that this result is not driven by the crisis only.
Since money market liquidity was persistently high from 2001 until the
first half of 2007 illiquid MMFs persistently outperformed liquid MMFs. Per-
sistence of MMFs' returns is therefore not only driven by persistence of expense
ratios but also by the portfolio structure and the persistence of market-wide
liquidity.
Enhancing returns by investing in illiquid assets, however, comes at a cost.
If market-wide liquidity drops managers face problems, when investors want
to redeem their shares. They have to sell relatively illiquid assets at fire sale
prices, which results in a reduction of returns. This in turn might lead to
further outflows. An illiquidity shock can therefore trigger a self-fulfilling run.
For this reason, we now move to analyze the flows in and out of MMFs result-
ing from a market-wide illiquidity shock.
4.4 Market Illiquidity and Fund Flows
A market-wide liquidity shock can a-priory have two effects on investors (See
Gorton & Pennacchi 1992, Pennacchi 2006, Miles 2001): On the one hand,
investors can see money market funds as a safe haven, which would lead to
inflows into money market funds. On the other hand, a sudden drop in liquid-
ity can cause investors to withdraw their money because they are concerned
about a value reduction. If other investors fear a reduction in value caused by
the initial redemptions, the liquidity shock can lead to a self-fulfilling run.
The likelihood of a run depends crucially on the liquidity of the portfolio.
A withdrawal in illiquid times results in costs, because the fund manager has
to sell her assets at a bad time and can only achieve a smaller price. Since it
usually takes some days for the fund manager to restore her cash balance, these
costs affect mainly the remaining investors in the fund. Therefore, redemption
impose a negative externality on the remaining investors. If this externality
23
becomes sizable, the expectation of other investors withdrawing their money
can cause the remaining investors to also withdraw their money, resulting in a
self-fulfilling run. The negative externality and consequently the likelihood of
a run increases with market illiquidity and the illiquidity of the portfolio. Our
second testable hypothesis therefore is:
Hypothesis 2: In illiquid times funds that hold illiquid assets are
more likely to experience a run than funds that
hold liquid assets.
As a first test of this hypothesis we examine the cumulative net flows of
German MMFs during the subprime crisis (2007/07 - 2008/06) in Figure 6.
Money market funds are sorted in 2007/06 into four groups according to their
share of liquid assets.12 Overall, money market funds lost 10.8 billion Euro in
the crisis period (Compare also Figure 3). The most illiquid quartile of funds
lost around 7.2 billion Euro, which accounts for the majority of all outflows.
In relation to their total assets before the crisis (2007/06) the quartile of the
most illiquid funds lost around 60% of their assets. It can clearly be seen, that
the intensity of outflows decreases with portfolio liquidity. The most liquid
funds only experienced outflows of around 5%.
To evaluate the impact of market liquidity shocks on MMFs' flows more closely
we specify the following empirical model:
Netflowit

where Netflowit
is the relative net flow of fund i in period t. The flow is
measured relative to total assets of the previous month. Liq. Assetsi,t-1
is our
previously used proxy for portfolio liquidity. We include past excess return

ties, bank deposits and commercial papers as proxy for liquidity.

bad performance of the fund (e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998). More recently a per-
formance flow relationship has also been documented for MMFs (Koppenhaver
& Sapp 2005). Market illiquidity Spreadt
is again measured by the spread be-
tween the Euribor and the Bubill rate, both maturing in 6 months.
This money market spread enters directly and as interaction term with
portfolio liquidity into the regression equation. Hypothesis 2 suggest that
investors react differently to a market-wide liquidity shock depending on the
liquidity of the portfolio. An increase in the money market spread alone should
lead to outflows, which should result in a negative 3
. Liquid funds, on the
other hand, should experience less outflows when facing market illiquidity. We
expect therefore the coefficient of the interaction term 4
to be positive. The
regression equation also includes an interaction term of market illiquidity with
past excess return to test whether the performance flow relationship changes
in liquid and illiquid times.
Again, the log of of total net assets is added as a control. It is generally
found that small funds grow faster than large funds. Similarly, we include the
age in years as a control variable into the regression. Older funds are also as-
sociated with less inflows (Sirri & Tufano 1998). We only include funds which
existed for at least two years. Recently founded funds usually experience very
large inflows in relative terms. This can lead to an outlier problem and skew
the results (Berk & Tonks 2007).
The results are displayed in Table 7. We estimate equation 6 first using
the fund fixed effects (Panel A) and second using fund and time fixed effects
(Panel B). The control variables Sizei,t-1
and Agei,t-1
have the expected neg-
ative sign. We find a positive performance flow relationship. A increase in
excess return leads to an inflow and a decrease in performance leads to an out-
flows of funds. The performance sensitivity of investors might be the reason
why fund managers increased the risk of their portfolio and enhanced their
funds in the first place. Similarly, we find some evidence that liquid assets
lead to outflows in liquid times. This is in line with the positive performance
flow relationship. Liquid assets earn less return in good times and investors
respond by withdrawing their money.
A sudden increase in market illiquidity has a negative effect on flows, which
26
confirms the hypothesis of a run on illiquid funds. An increase in liquid assets
limits outflows and counteracts this first effect. Funds with a large amount of
liquid assets will therefore not experience significant outflows after an illiquid-
ity shock. Figure 7 plots the marginal effect of market illiquidity on net flows
as a function of portfolio liquidity.13 Money market funds with less than 30%
of liquid assets experience significant outflows after an illiquidity shock (at the
5% significance level). In contrast, there are no significant outflows after an
illiquidity shock for funds with a share of above 30%.
This result shows the crucial importance of portfolio liquidity in preventing
runs. MMFs that are truly narrow are immune against runs and thus there is
no need for deposit insurance. By contrast, MMFs that enhance their returns
by deviating from the narrow to a wider portfolio structure expose themselves
to the risk of a run.
13The marginal effect and its variance is calculated as follows (For details see e.g. Greene
2003, 123-124):

Table 7: The Influence of Market Illiquidity on Fund Flows
Note: The table shows a fixed effects regression of fund net flows (mea-
sured in relation to total assets). Liquid Assets is the portfolio share of
treasury securities, bank deposits and commercial papers. Excess return
denotes the annualized return in excess of the 3-month Bubill rate, spread
is the spread between the 6-month Euribor and the 6-month Bubill rate
and serves as a proxy for money market illiquidity. Size measured as the
log of total assets and and age in years are added as control variables. In
Panel A we control for fund fixed effects and in Panel B we additionally
control for time fixed effects. The sample contains money market funds
from 1999/01 - 2008/06. We only include funds with an age above two
year so that the large growth rates of young funds do not skew the results.

Figure 7: Marginal Effect of Market Illiquidity on Net
Flows
This figure displays the marginal effect of market illiquidity on
net flows as a function of portfolio liquidity (solid line). 95 %
confidence intervals are also provided (dotted lines). Estimates
are taken from Table 7, Panel A, Column (3). Market illiquidity
is measured by the Euribor-Bubill spread and portfolio liquidity
is approximated by the share of traditional money market instru-
ments.
5 Conclusion
This paper showed that in liquid times some MMFs' managers enhanced their
returns by investing in less liquid assets. We give evidence that this drive (ger.:
"Drang") to higher returns is motivated by investors reacting to bad perfor-
mance and withdrawing their money. By investing in illiquid assets funds can
outperform other funds as long as liquidity in the market is high. Investing in
less liquid assets, however, widens the narrow structure of money market funds
and makes them vulnerable to runs. During the liquidity crisis of 2007/2008
we observe runs (ger.: "Sturm") on money market funds with enhanced and
illiquid portfolios. Money market funds with more liquid portfolios, in con-
trast, had no significant outflows and functioned as a safe haven.
The study shows the risk involved in investing in illiquid assets when a
30
open-ended structure is involved. Most importantly, this paper gives evidence
that runs are even possible in the, usually highly liquid, money market seg-
ment.
The results raise the question of how to ensure the stability of money mar-
ket funds. Additional regulations with regard to permitted assets and maturity
are not necessarily the right solution. Increasing transparency would already
help private investors to gain better insight in the risks they are taking when
investing in money market funds. Up to now asset composition of German
MMFs is only scarcely available to the public and not standardized. Higher
transparency should allow investors to select funds given their liquidity and
risk preferences.
Further, an insurance provided by the fund issuer might play an important
role in the stability of MMFs. During the course of the subprime crisis MMFs'
assets have increased in the US, where an implicit insurance is provided. Gor-
ton & Pennacchi (1992) argue that an implicit insurance can reduce the risk
of a run on MMFs in two ways: From the investor's perspective, an insurance
can establish trust in the money market fund and thus avoid a self-fulfilling
run. From the manager's perspective, the insurance payed by the fund issuer
gives an incentive to reduce the riskiness of the portfolio
