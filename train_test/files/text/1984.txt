Abstract
Background: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a rampantly growing
epidemic in the United States, affecting nearly 10% of the adult
population. Studies have shown that higher levels of Total Biliru-
bin (TBili) convey a protective effect with regard to cardiovascular
risk. In this study, we will examine the relationship between TBili
level and prevalence of DM to discern whether a similar relation-
ship exists.
Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) is a comprehensive survey performed regularly to
evaluate the overall health and nutrition status of the United States
population. For the purpose of this study, we combined NHANES
data collected between 1999 and 2006. Totally 15,876 eligible par-
ticipants were selected after excluding all patients younger than
twenty years, those with a history of abnormal liver function tests,
or those who disclosed a history of liver disease. The data collected
on these individuals was adjusted for demographic characteristics,
as well as risk factors for DM, and was analyzed via multivariate
logistic regression, using SAS proc survey methodology.
Results: After age adjustment, increased TBili was associated with
26% reduction in diabetes risk (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.88). Mul-
tivariate analysis, adjusting for all diabetes risk factors assessed,
confirmed this association (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 - 0.95).
Conclusions: Our results show that a higher level of serum TBili
is associated with odds of having a lower incidence of DM. This
finding supports the hypothesis that the antioxidant nature of TBili,
demonstrating a protective effect with regard to the risk of stroke,
atherosclerosis, and vasculitis in prior research, also extends to DM
risk. Furthermore, research has shown that higher levels of TBili in-
crease glucose mobilization into the cells, leading to more efficient,
biologic glucose utilization. There is no doubt that the beneficial
effect of TBili is multifactorial; thus further investigation is war-
ranted.

Introduction
Diabetes Mellitus has become an epidemic throughout the
world. Prevalence data, collected in 2007, indicate that 7.8%
of the population have been diagnosed with this disease [1].
From a fiscal standpoint, the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus
is associated with a two-fold rise in medical cost, equaling
approximately $116 billion dollars in direct expenditures
and $58 million in indirect expenditures, in the United States
(US) [1]. Given this disease's dramatic impact on the physi-
cal and financial health of the US population, disease pre-
vention has taken on paramount importance. With this focus
in mind, research activity has focused on finding physiologic
factors that decrease a person's risk of developing Diabetes
Mellitus.
Bilirubin has been conjectured to be one such factor.
There is a growing body of literature which shows that high-
er Total Bilirubin levels (TBili) are protective against car-
diovascular disease, Stroke and Peripheral Arterial Disease
[2-7]. Studies suggest that an increased expression of Heme
Oxygenase, an enzyme used to break down the hemoglobin
into bilirubin, is associated with enhanced insulin sensitiv-
ity and glucose metabolism, thus resulting in greater rates
of rat model euglycemia [8, 9]. Furthermore, the antioxidant
properties of TBili have been postulated to reverse oxidative
damage associated with a hyperglycemic state [10]. Con-
sequently, we have undertaken this population-based study
to assess whether higher levels of TBili, within the physi-
ologically normal range, convey a decreased risk of Diabetes
Mellitus in the US population.

Materials and Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a nation-wide survey performed jointly by
the National Center for Health Statistics and the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on a representative
sample of the United States (US) population. This sample
is chosen using a stratified, multistage probability cluster
sampling design of the non-institutionalized, non-military
US population [11]. Components of this survey include
questionnaires about demographics and health status, gen-
eral medical examinations, as well as laboratory tests of var-
ied bodily fluids. The physical examination component of
NHANES consists of medical, dental, AND anthropometri-
cal measurements collected by trained personnel [12].
For the purpose of our study, we examined NHANES
data collected between 1999 and 2006. Exclusion criteria in
our protocol removed all data for NHANES participants who
were younger than twenty years-of-age, who reported a his-
tory of liver disease, who had abnormal liver function studies,
or who had missing data values. Of 41,474 participants who
had data collected during our seven-year period-of-interest,
15,876 did not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Based on
previous studies we stratified TBili into two groups. One had
the TBili level of less than 10 micromol/L and the other had a
level of greater than or equal to 10 micromol/L [2, 23].
Laboratory methods
To measure total Bilirubin, NHANES used the LX20 process
which utilizes a timed endpoint Diazo method. The basis of
this method is formation of Azobilrubin from a reaction with
a Diazo reagent. The change in the absorbance level of the
reagent is measured, as this value is directly proportional to
the concentration of Bilirubin. Fasting blood sugar was mea-
sured using Roche/Hitachi 911 instrument (Roche Diagnos-
tics, Indianapolis) on early morning serum sample, for which
subjects were asked to fast for nine hours. [11].
Case definition
Case definition of Diabetes Mellitus was based on fasting
blood sugar value of not less than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L)
and the participant's response to the following questions: (1)
`Other than during pregnancy, have you ever been told by a
doctor or other health professional that you have diabetes or
sugar diabetes?'; (2) `Are you taking insulin now?'; (3) `Are
you taking any pills to decrease your blood sugar?'.
Definition of covariables
The NHANES questionnaire section was used for the char-
acterization of age, sex, race, tobacco use pattern, alcohol
use, highest level of education achieved, and marital status.
Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure
of 140 mm Hg, a mean diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm
Hg, or reporting a physician diagnosis of high blood pres-
sure. Total cholesterol was defined as reporting that a phy-
sician had diagnosed that person with high cholesterol or
reporting that a physician had advised that person to take
cholesterol lowering medications. Prevalent cardiovascular
disease was defined as a self-reported history of coronary
heart disease, previous heart attack, or history of stroke. BMI
was categorized into the three categories of normal, over-
weight and obese based on CDC guidelines [13].
Statistical analysis
In order to account for the complex, stratified, multi-
stage probability cluster sampling design employed in the
NHANES survey, we analyzed this data using SAS version
9.1's (Cary, North Carolina) Proc Survey methodology. Vari-
ance was estimated using the jackknife replacement method.
We calculated the age-adjusted prevalence estimates, strati-
fied by demographics and pre-determined risk factors. We
used proc survey logistic regression to create a risk-factor
based model, and calculated odds ratios with 95% confi-
dence Intervals. These models were specifically adjusted
for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol, education and marital
status.
Results
The bilirubin levels in the sample population were normally
distributed, with a small right sided tail (Fig. 1). The mean
TBili level was 11.89 micromol/L, with a standard deviation

of 5.31.
The demographic variables of the two groups were com-
pared by age adjusted prevalence (Table 1).Agreater propor-
tion of men were found to have a serum TBili level above
10 micromol/L. For individuals who had Diabetes Mellitus,
70.45% (SE = 0.86) had a TBili level of 10 micromol/L. Fur-
thermore, a statistically-significant, unadjusted association
between higher TBili level and Diabetes did exist (OR: 0.74,
95% CI: 0.64 - 0.88). The relationship remained significant,
after adjusting for age, sex, race, married status, education,
BMI and smoking (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67 - 0.95) (Fig. 2
and 3).
Discussion
Our study supports the notion that people with high TBili
have lesser odds of prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DMI
and DMII). This is in keeping with previously reported stud-
ies which have shown higher TBili levels to be protective
against Coronary Artery Disease, Stroke and Peripheral Vas-
cular Disease [2-7].
Bilirubin has been regarded as a powerful endogenous
anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory agent [14-18]. Thus, it
stands to reason that higher TBili levels may be protective
against the autoimmune, inflammation-related pathology of
type 1 diabetes and oxidative physiologic stress associated
with development of type 2 diabetes [19]. Current research
also suggests that physiological levels of TBili block the pro-
duction of various free radicals that might hinder the inhibi-
tory responses of the cell to take up the high glucose [20].
Furthermore, it is shown to prevent the vascular endothelial
activation from the oxidative stress in the vessels [21, 22].
In addition, rat model studies of DM II have shown that

increased expression of Heme Oxygenase-1, the enzyme
responsible for conversion of Hemoglobin to Bilirubin, is
associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose me-
tabolism resulting in greater rates of rat model euglycemia.
Moreover, Hemin, an activator of the Heme Oxygenase sys-
tem, has been found to increase the expression of GLUT-4
receptors and Adiponectin, a hormone which increases insu-
lin sensitivity [20]. Similar to TBili, and in light of its anti-
inflammatory properties, higher Adiponectin levels have
been associated with lower DM prevalence. However, unlike
Adiponectin since TBili is a commonly measured laboratory
value, measuring TBili levels would offer a cost-effective
method of DM risk stratification..
This study follows a complex sampling with the provi-
sion of the weights, which makes it more realistic to project
on to the United States population. The amalgamation of
four large cross sectional surveys done on the representative
population of the United States from 1999 to 2006 translated
this study high volume population based study. So we got a
fair amount of population who have diabetes and who didn't.
The stratification of total bilirubin into 2 groups, one having
a TBili level of less than 10 micromol/L and the other having
the TBili level of greater than or equal to 10 millimol/L is
based on previous study which showed that a level of TBili
equal to or above 10 millimol/L is cardio protective [23].
Another interesting observation is that there is a greater

distribution of population in the higher TBili group which
had the bilirubin greater or equal to 10 micromol/L, which
was nearly consistent in all demographic groups. Needless
to say also there is most of the population distribution in the
latter group ( 10 micromol/L) with respect to prevalence of
diabetes and prevalence of `no diabetes' (66.1% vs 33.8% of
diabetes group and 70.5% vs 29.5% of `no diabetes' group.
Our use of population-adjusted data from a national sur-
vey, using predetermined definition is not without its limita-
tions. One major limitation to this study is that the definition
of Diabetes Mellitus is predicated on subject recollection
and self reported diagnosis, thus introducing a component of
recall bias. In order to compensate for this, we have added
fasting blood sugar measurements into our study's definition
of Diabetes Mellitus.
For similar reasons, our study is limited in its ability to
determine whether the protective effects of TBili are limited
to only one form of Diabetes Mellitus, or whether the protec-
tive effect influences the incidence and prevalence of both
DM type1 and type 2. Also, the cross sectional nature of the
data derived from NHAHES's methodology hinders deter-
mination of a temporal association or the cause-and-effect
between TBili and development of DM type 1 or type 2. The
lack of fractionation of TBili also limits our ability to deter-
mine whether it is the indirect fraction, the direct fraction,
or a combined effect of the varied fractions of TBili, which
convey the protective effect we described in this study [24].
In conclusion, there appears to be a beneficial effect of
TBili on Diabetes. Further investigation is warranted in or-
der to delineate whether this protective phenomenon extends
to all forms of Diabetes Mellitus, whether it is conveyed by
both Indirect and Direct Bilirubin, and what avenues are
available to therapeutically raise an at-risk patient's bilirubin
levels for optimal protection from this dreaded disease.
