Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different reference ranges in bone mineral
density on the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 357 men and 870 women aged between 18 and 89 years, who were
randomly sampled from various districts within Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine
and whole body was measured by DXA (Hologic QDR4500). Polynomial regression models and bootstraps method
were used to determine peak BMD and standard deviation (SD). Based on the two parameters, we computed T-
scores (denoted by TVN
) for each individual in the study. A similar diagnosis was also done based on T-scores
provided by the densitometer (TDXA
), which is based on the US White population (NHANES III). We then compared
the concordance between TVN
and TDXA
in the classification of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined according
to the World Health Organization criteria.
Results: In post-menopausal women, the prevalence of osteoporosis based on femoral neck TVN
was 29%, but
when the diagnosis was based on TDXA
, the prevalence was 44%. In men aged 50+ years, the TVN
-based
prevalence of osteoporosis was 10%, which was lower than TDXA
-based prevalence (30%). Among 177 women who
were diagnosed with osteoporosis by TDXA
, 35% were actually osteopenia by TVN
. The kappa-statistic was 0.54 for
women and 0.41 for men.
Conclusion: These data suggest that the T-scores provided by the Hologic QDR4500 over-diagnosed osteoporosis
in Vietnamese men and women. This over-diagnosis could lead to over-treatment and influence the decision of
recruitment of participants in clinical trials.

Background
Osteoporosis and its consequence of fragility fracture
represent a major public health problem not only in
developed countries, but in developing countries as well
[1]. The number of fractures in Asia is higher than that
in European countries combined. Of all the fractures in
the world, approximately 17% was found to occur in
Southeast Asia, 29% in West Pacific, as compared to
35% occurring in Europe [2]. However, the prevalence
of and risk factors for osteoporosis in Asian populations
have not been well documented. Part of the problem is
due to the lack of well-defined criteria for the diagnosis
of osteoporosis in Asian men and women.
Currently, the operational definition of osteoporosis is
based on a measurement of bone mineral density
(BMD), which is the most robust predictor of fracture
risk [3,4]. BMD of an individual is often expressed in
terms of its peak level and standard deviation to yield a
T-score. The two parameters (i.e., peak BMD level and
standard deviation) are commonly derived from a well
characterized population of young individuals [5]. An
individual's T-score is actually the number of standard
deviations from the peak BMD achieved during the age
of 20 and 30 years [6,7]. However, previous studies have

suggested that peak BMD is different among ethnicities
and between men and women [8,9]. Therefore, the diag-
nosis of osteoporosis should ideally be based on sex-
and ethnicity-specific reference range [10,11].
Dual-energy × ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered
the gold standard method for measuring BMD [6]. In
recent years, DXA has been introduced to many Asian
countries, including Vietnam, and is commonly used for
the diagnosis of osteoporosis and treatment decision. In
the absence of sex-specific reference data for local popu-
lation, most doctors used the T-scores provided by the
densitometer as a referent value to make diagnosis for
an individual. However, it is not clear whether the refer-
ence data base used in the derivation of T-scores in
these densitometers is appropriate for a local popula-
tion. We hypothesize that there is considerable discre-
pancy in the diagnosis of osteoporosis between
reference data. The present study was designed to test
the hypothesis, by determining reference range of peak
bone density for an Asian population, and then compar-
ing the concordance between a population-specific T-
score and the DXA-based T-score in the diagnosis of
osteoporosis.
Methods
Study design and participants
The study was designed as a cross-sectional investiga-
tion, with the setting being Ho Chi Minh City, a major
city in Vietnam. The research protocol and procedures
were approved by the Scientific Committee of the Peo-
ple's Hospital 115 and Pham Ngoc Thach University of
Medicine. All volunteer participants were provided with
full information about the study's purpose and gave
informed consent to participate in the study, according
to the principles of medical ethics of the World Health
Organization.
We used simple random sampling technique for iden-
tifying potential participants. We approached commu-
nity organizations, including church and temples, and
obtained the list of members, and then randomly
selected individuals aged 18 or above. We sent a letter
of invitation to the selected individuals. The participants
received a free health check-up, and lipid analyses, but
did not receive any financial incentive. No invited parti-
cipants refused to participate in the study.
Participants were excluded from the study if they had
diseases deemed to affect to bone metabolism such as
hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, renal failure,
malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, chronic colitis,
multi- myeloma, leukemia, and chronic arthritis.
Measurements and data collection
Data collection was done by trained research doctors
and nurses using a validated questionnaire. The
questionnaire solicited information, including anthropo-
metry, lifestyle factors, dietary intakes, physical activity,
and clinical history. Anthropometric parameters includ-
ing age, weight, standing height were obtained. Body
weight was measured on an electronic scale with indoor
clothing without shoes. Height was determined without
shoes on a portable stadiometer with mandible plane
parallel to the floor. Each participant was asked to pro-
vide information on current and past smoking habits.
Smoking was quantified in terms of the number of
pack-years consumed in each ten-year interval age
group. Alcohol intake in average numbers of standard
drinks per day, at present as well as within the last 5
years, was obtained. Clinical data including blood pres-
sure, pulse, and reproductive history (i.e. parity, age of
menarche, and age of menopause), medical history (i.e.
previous fracture, previous and current use of pharma-
cological therapies) were also obtained.
Bone mineral density
Areal BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L2-L4),
femoral neck, and whole body using a Hologic QDR
4500 (Hologic Corp, Madison, WI, USA). The short-
term in vivo precision expressed as the coefficient of
variation was 1.8% for the lumbar spine and 1.5% for
the hip. The machine was standardized by standard
phantom before each measurement.
The densitometer provided a T-score for each mea-
sured site. In this paper, the T-score is referred to as
TDXA
. We used the WHO criteria to categorize TDXA
into
three groups: osteoporosis if the T-score is equal to or
lower than -2.5; osteopenia if T-score is between -1 and
-2.5; and normal if T-score is equal or greater than -1.
Determination of reference range
In this analysis, we made use of the functional relation-
ship between BMD and age to construct a reference
range. A series of polynomial regression models (up to
the third degree) were fitted to femoral neck, total hip
and lumbar spine BMD as a function of age as follows:
BMD = a + b1
(age) + b2
(age)2 + b3
(age)3, where a is
the intercept, b1
, b1
, and b3
are regression parameters,
which were estimated from the observed data. Reduced
models (i.e., quadratic and linear models) were consid-
ered, and the "final" model was chosen based on the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Peak BMD (pBMD)
and ages at which it was reached were then estimated
from the final model. Ninety-five percent confidence
intervals (95% CI) for pBMD and ages of pBMD were
determined by the bootstrap (resampling) method. The
analysis was performed with R statistical software [12].
Based on the parameters in the polynomial regression
models, we determined the means of peak BMD and
standard deviation (SD) for spine and femoral neck

BMD. Using the two parameters, we calculated the
T-score for each individual (denoted by TVN
), and used
the WHO criteria to classify the T-score into three
groups, namely, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal.
The concordance between TDXA
and TVN
was then
assessed by the kappa statistic.
Results
In total, 1227 individuals (357 men and 870 women)
aged 18 years or older participated in the study. In this
sample, 58.5% of men and 51% of women were at age
50+ years, respectively. As expected, BMD in men was
higher than in women by ~12% at femoral neck and by
~7% at lumbar spine (Table 1).
Peak bone mineral density
The relationship between BMD and age was best
described by the third-degree polynomial regression
model (Figures 1 and 2). The relationship was character-
ized by three phases, namely, BMD increased between
the ages of 18 and 25, followed by a steady period (aged
between 25 and 45), and then gradually declined after
the age of 45. The age-related decrease in BMD in
women was greater than that in men. For example,
compared with lumbar spine BMD among women aged
between 20-30 years, lumbar spine BMD among women
aged 70+ years was decreased by 27%; however, in men,
the corresponding rate of decrease was ~15%. A similar
sex-differential decline was also observed in femoral
neck BMD.
Based on the parameters of the polynomial regression
model (Table 2), we estimated pBMD and the age of
pBMD for men and women (Table 3). Consistently,
pBMD was higher in men compared with women, but
the difference was dependent on skeletal site. For exam-
ple, for lumbar spine, pBMD in men (1.05 ± 0.12 g/cm2;
mean ± SD) was about 9% higher than in women
(0.96 ± 0.11 g/cm2). Similarly, pBMD at the femoral
neck in men (0.85 ± 0.13 g/cm2) was 6% higher than in
women (0.80 ± 0.11 g/cm2). The age achieving pBMD
was reached in women was younger than in men. For
example, at the femoral neck, age of pBMD in women
was 22.4 years (95% CI: 19 - 24) which was earlier than
in men (26; 95% CI: 24 - 29). This trend was also
observed at the lumbar spine (25 in women and
27 years in men).
Prevalence of osteoporosis
Based on pBMD and SD, T-scores were calculated for
men aged 50+ years or post-menopausal women, and
these were referred to as TVN
, to differentiate with TDXA
which was automatically provided by the densitometer
(Table 4). In women aged over 50 years, TVN
was higher
than TDXA
at femoral neck (-1.84 ± 0.96 vs -2.27 ± 0.96;
P < 0.0001) and at the lumbar spine (-1.61 ± 1.28 vs
-2.39 ± 1.31; P < 0.0001). In men aged over 50 years,
the same trend also was also found at the femoral neck
(-1.50 ± 0.90 vs -2.01 ± 0.86; P < 0.0001), and at the
lumbar spine (-1.33 ± 1.33 vs -1.81 ± 1.43; P < 0.0001).
As expected, although absolute values of TVN
and
TDXA
were different, the correlation between them was
high (r > 0.98). The linear equation (without intercept)
linking the two scores is as follows: at the femoral neck,
TVN
= 1.177 × TDXA
for women, and TVN
= 1.246 ×
TDXA
for men; at the lumbar spine, TVN
= 1.298 × TDXA
for women, and TVN = 1.207 × TDXA
for men. The
equations suggest that, for example, at the femoral neck,
TVN
was higher than TDXA
by 0.18 SD (in men) to 0.25
SD (in women).
The concordance between two diagnoses of osteo-
porosis (i.e., TVN
and TDXA
) is shown in Table 5. TDXA
tended to over-diagnose osteoporosis more than did
TVN
. In women aged 50+ years, using femoral neck
TVN
, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 28.6%, but
when the diagnosis was based on TDXA
, the prevalence
was 43.7%. In men aged 50+ years, the TVN
-based pre-
valence of osteoporosis was 10.4%, which was only a-
third of the TDXA
-based prevalence (29.6%). The discre-
pancy mainly occurred in the osteopenic group. For
example, among 40 men diagnosed by TDXA
to have
osteoporosis, there was 65% of them (n = 26) were actu-
ally identified as having osteopenia by TVN
. Similarly,
among 177 women where were diagnosed with osteo-
porosis by TDXA
, 35% (n = 61) were actually osteopenic
by TVN
. The kappa statistic was 0.54 for women and
0.41 for men.
Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) reference data for US Whites (aged
between 20 and 29) [13], we computed T-score for each
individual aged 50+ years, and classified into either nor-
mal, osteopenia or osteoporosis group. We found that

the prevalence of osteoporosis was 30% (n = 40/135) in
men and 43% (n = 160/368) in women. These preva-
lence rates are almost identical to the prevalence derived
from the TDXA
. In fact, the concordance in osteoporosis
classification between TDXA
and NHANES data was
100% for men and 96% for women.
Discussion
To assess the magnitude of the problem, it is essential
to establish an appropriate measure for the diagnosis of
osteoporosis. Currently, osteoporosis is operationally
defined in terms of BMD, which is compared to a nor-
mative database [5]. However, it is well known that

measured values of BMD differ across ethnicities
[9,11,14], and the referent database should therefore be
ethnicity-specific. In this study, we have shown that
there was a considerable discrepancy in the diagnosis of
osteoporosis between referent data derived from the
local population and referent data that are provided by
the densitometer.
It is clear from this analysis that the densitometer
reference data over-diagnosed osteoporosis in the Viet-
namese population. Using the local normative data, we
found that the prevalence of osteoporosis in Vietnamese
women and men aged 50+ years was 29% and 10%,
respectively. However, using the DXA-provided norma-
tive data, the prevalence in women and men was 44%
and 30%, respectively. The discrepancy raises a question
of which T-score is more appropriate. In a recent study
in 328 Vietnamese postmenopausal women using DXA
Lunar Prodigy, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 26%
[15]. Another smaller study in Vietnamese postmeno-
pausal women living in United State showed that this
prevalence was 37% [16]. The prevalence of osteoporosis
in postmenopausal Thai women was around 29% [17].
In Caucasians, the prevalence of osteoporosis in postme-
nopausal women ranged between 20% and 25% [18,19].
In summary, most of these studies in Asian and Cauca-
sian women found that the prevalence of osteoporosis
ranged between 20 and 30% [18-20], which is highly
consistent with the present study's estimate. These data
also suggest that the densitometer-provided T-score is
not appropriate for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in
Vietnamese women.
Why there were differences between TVN
and TDXA
?
The most "proximate" explanation is that there were dif-
ferences in peak BMD and standard deviation between

the Hologic normative data and the present normative
data. However, the standard deviation in BMD is very
stable across populations; therefore, the main reason
could be that peak BMD value provided by the Hologic
densitometer was higher than peak BMD in Vietnamese.
Assuming that SD of femoral neck BMD was 0.12 g/
cm2, with TDXA
, one could infer that peak BMD was
0.92 and 0.86 g/cm2 in men and women, respectively.
These values are identical to the femoral neck BMD
reference values for US White men and women of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)[13]. In reality, the observed peak BMD in
our study was 0.85 g/cm2 (men) and 0.80 g/cm2
(women). It is obvious that the peak BMD provided by
the densitometer was derived from a non-Vietnamese
population, which may not be applicable to the Vietna-
mese population.
In this study, the relationship between BMD and age
followed a third degree polynomial function, which is
consistent with a recent study [15]. According to this
functional relationship, Vietnamese women achieved
their peak BMD at the age of 27-29, which was later
than that in Caucasian (20-25 years). Although it is not
possible to determine the underlying factors for this
apparent difference, it is well-known that Asian girls
tend to have a later menarche than Caucasian girls (13
vs 12 years).
Osteoporosis in men, particularly Asian men, has not
been well documented. The present study was among
the first research about osteoporosis in Asian men. In
this study, about one tenth of men aged over 50 had
osteoporosis. This prevalence is highly comparable with
previous estimate from Caucasian men [19]. Individuals
with osteoporosis are at high risk of fragility fracture
[21,22]. In this study, we found that almost 30% of
women (and 10% of men) aged 50+ years had osteo-
porosis, implying that the magnitude of osteoporosis in
Vietnam is as high as in developed countries.
The present results have to be interpreted within the
context of strengths and potential limitations. First, the
study represents one of the largest studies of osteo-
porosis in Asian populations, and as such, it increased
the reliability of estimates of peak bone mass and pre-
valence of osteoporosis. Second, the study population
is highly homogeneous, which reduces the effects of
potential confounders that could compromise the esti-
mates. The participants were randomly selected
according to a rigorous sampling scheme, which
ensures the representativeness of the general popula-
tion. Third, the technique of measurement of BMD is
considered "gold standard" for the assessment of bone
strength. Nevertheless, the study also has a number of
potential weaknesses. The participants in this study
were sampled from an urban population; as a result,
the study's finding may not be generalizable to the
rural population. Because we excluded individuals with
diseases deemed to interfere with bone metabolism,
the prevalence of osteoporosis reported here could be
an underestimate of the prevalence in the general
population. Ideally, peak bone density should be esti-
mated from a longitudinal study in which a large num-
ber of men and women is followed from the age of 5
till the age of 30, but such a study is not practically
feasible. On the other hand, estimate of peak BMD in
cross-sectional study such as the present study can be
biased by unmeasured confounders.
Nevertheless, the present findings have important
public health and clinical implications. Because indivi-
duals with T-scores being or less than -2.5 are often
treated, the over-diagnosis by TDXA
could have led to
over-treatment in the general population. Moreover,
individuals with T-scores being or less than -2.5 are also
candidates for anti-fracture clinical trials or clinical stu-
dies, the use of TDXA
could have included some women
in such studies and exposed them to unnecessary risk.
Thus, it seems prudent to use local normative data for
the diagnosis of osteoporosis in order to avoid over-
diagnosis or over-treatment.
Conclusion
In summary, these data suggest that the prevalence of
osteoporosis in Vietnamese men (10%) and women
(30%) aged 50+ years is comparable with those in
Caucasian populations. The data also indicated that the
T-score provided by the Hologic QDR4500 over-diag-
nosed osteoporosis in Vietnamese men and women. We
propose to use the data developed in this study for the
diagnosis of osteoporosis in the Vietnamese population.
