Abstract
Environmental sustainability may be seen as a collective challenge that can only be met if a sufficient number
of individuals cooperate. Whether or not individual tourists are willing to contribute their share may thus
depend not only on the degree to which they think that environmental sustainability is important (attitudes),
but also on the degree to which they think that other tourists hold similar attitudes (social comparison). Other
possible influences are beliefs that one's own behaviour can make a difference (self-efficacy beliefs) and that
tourists as a group together can make a difference (collective efficacy beliefs). This paper reports on findings
from a study (N ¼ 358) that investigated the role of these factors in explaining people's willingness to pay for
environmental protection when travelling. Attitudes, self-efficacy and collective efficacy accounted for 30% of
the variance in willingness to pay for environmental protection; social comparison did not explain additional
variance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Introduction
The question of how to encourage people to behave in
environmentally sustainable ways has caught the atten-
tion of researchers within various disciplines. A broad
distinction can be made between research focusing
either on structural or on informational strategies (cf.
Steg and Vlek, 2009). Structural strategies aim at
implementing behavioural change through changing
the situational circumstances in which decisions are
made. One common approach within this stream of
research is to identify and eliminate external factors
that may hinder people from engaging in pro-
environmental behaviour (e.g. costs and benefits of
different behavioural alternatives; Van Raaij, 2002).
Informational strategies seek to achieve behavioural
change through targeting internal factors such as atti-
tudes and beliefs without intervening with the situ-
ational circumstances. Research in this vein often
draws upon psychological theories that view human
behaviour as planned and deliberate (e.g. theory of
planned behaviour; Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010). The
present paper follows up on the latter line of research

and examines individual characteristics of people who
are willing to pay for environmental protection when
travelling.
In order better to understand what influences deci-
sions to pay for environmental protection, it may be
helpful to conceive of environmental sustainability as a
large-scale social dilemma ­ a situation in which the
attainment of a desired collective outcome depends on
the cooperation of many individuals (cf. Van Lange
et al., 1998). The crux of social dilemmas is that
each individual (or group member) is to decide
between behavioural alternatives that maximize per-
sonal interests and behavioural alternatives that maxi-
mize collective interests. While the rational choice for
each individual is to pursue personal interests, the
group as a whole will only achieve the best possible
outcome if everybody subordinates own interests to
those concerned with collective benefits (Dawes and
Messick, 2000). With regard to travelling, the choice
of environmentally sustainable travel options (e.g.
transportation with low carbon dioxide emissions)
can be regarded as an alternative that maximizes col-
lective interests (e.g. mitigating global climate change,
pursuing environmental sustainability), and the choice
of conventional travel options can be regarded as an
alternative that maximizes personal interests, because
it is usually associated with lower individual costs (e.g.
cheaper, less time consuming).
In large-scale social dilemmas, such as in the case of
environmental sustainability, individuals may feel that
their own efforts to foster collective interests make
little difference. People's beliefs in their ability to
make a difference are often referred to as self-efficacy
beliefs, and research has shown that individuals with
stronger self-efficacy beliefs are more likely to contrib-
ute to collective benefits in social dilemmas (Kerr,
1992) and to help foster sustainable development
(Gupta and Ogden, 2009; Hanss and Bo
¨hm, 2010).
In addition, strong collective efficacy beliefs, that is, the
belief that the members of a group (e.g. tourists) can
together achieve desired outcomes might be decisive
for individual contributions in social dilemmas (De
Cremer, 1999; Seijts and Latham, 2000). Both self-
efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs are concerned
with questions about uncertainties that people may
think about when they are involved in a social
dilemma: Can I personally make a difference? Will
we together be able to make a difference? Another
uncertainty that characterizes social dilemmas has to
do with perceptions about the individual characteris-
tics of other group members (Van Lange et al., 1992).
For example, people may ask themselves whether
others are similarly concerned about environmental
problems associated with tourism. We assume that if
people believe that they hold stronger views regarding
the importance of mitigating these problems than the
typical tourist, they are less likely to choose environ-
mentally sustainable travel options because they may
doubt that others will contribute their share. In the
present study, we refer to comparisons between own
and others' attitudes towards environmentally sustain-
able tourism as social comparison.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether social
comparison contributes to explaining choices of environ-
mentally sustainable travel options, conceptualized as
willingness to pay for environmental protection when
travelling, along with absolute judgments of own atti-
tudes, self-efficacy beliefs and collective efficacy beliefs.
Literature review
Attitudes
Attitudes are evaluative judgments towards an object
with respect to some degree of favour or disfavour
(Eagly and Chaiken, 1993). Supporting the view that
these judgments play a major role in determining
human social behaviour (e.g. Ajzen and Gilbert Cote,
2008; Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010), there is a plethora of
empirical evidence linking attitudes to pro-environ-
mental behaviour (for two recent meta-analyses, see
Bamberg and Mo
¨ser, 2007; Klo
¨ckner, 2013). The typ-
ical finding in this research is that favourable attitudes
towards environmental preservation are associated with
pro-environmental behaviour. For example, Han et al.
(2010) demonstrated that environmental attitudes are
positively associated with intentions to stay at a green
hotel. Other contexts in which attitudes have been asso-
ciated with pro-environmental behaviour include, for
instance, travel mode choice (e.g. Thøgersen, 2006),
sustainable consumption (e.g. Tanner and Wo
¨lfing
Kast, 2003) or energy conservation (e.g. Hansla
et al., 2008). In line with this research, we assume
that people with strong positive attitudes towards envir-
onmentally sustainable tourism are more willing to pay
for environmental protection than people with less posi-
tive attitudes towards environmentally sustainable
tourism. By referring to positive attitudes towards
environmentally sustainable tourism, we mean evalu-
ative judgments in favour of actions that aim at limiting
the negative impacts of tourism on the natural environ-
ment (cf. Doran and Larsen, 2014).
Hypothesis 1 (attitudes): Positive attitudes towards
environmentally sustainable tourism will be positively
related to willingness to pay for environmental
protection.
As mentioned earlier, own attitudes towards envir-
onmentally sustainable tourism may not be the only
282 Tourism and Hospitality Research 15(4)
factor that influences people's willingness to pay for
environmental protection; social comparison may
also play a role. The rationale behind this assumption
is that people have an inherent need for self-evaluation
that motivates them (if there are no objective criteria
available) to compare own opinions and abilities to
those of others (Festinger, 1954). Previous research
on social comparison has demonstrated that the out-
comes of these evaluations are often biased in the sense
that there are systematic differences in the perception
of oneself and others (for a review, see, e.g., Chambers
and Windschitl, 2004). One such bias is the tendency
to view own characteristics more favourable than those
of similar others (Alicke and Govorun, 2005). An illus-
tration of this is provided by White and Plous (1995)
who found that people perceive themselves as being
more concerned about the environment and as show-
ing more environmental activism than most others.
Additionally, more than half of the participants in
that study expressed that they would be willing to do
more about protecting the environment if others would
be more concerned about the issue. These findings are
similar to those of Pieters et al. (1998) who demon-
strated that people tend to attribute more pro-environ-
mental behaviour and motivation to their own
households than to other relevant societal actors such
as other households, the government, agriculture and
industry.
Although an increasing body of literature indicates
that people wish to dissociate themselves from other
tourists (e.g. Doran et al., 2014; Prebensen et al.,
2003), there are yet few studies investigating social
comparison within the domain of environmentally sus-
tainable tourism. One notable exception is a recent
study that investigated whether tourists perceived
their own attitudes to be different from those of
other tourists (Doran and Larsen, 2014, Study 1).
While one group of participants was asked to judge
their own attitudes towards environmentally sustain-
able tourism, two other groups of participants were
asked to indicate what they thought to be the attitudes
of either a typical or an average tourist. It turned out
that judgments of own attitudes were more favourable
(i.e. more positive views about preserving the environ-
ment) than those concerning the other two groups,
and that there was no difference between judgments
of a typical or an average tourist (for similar findings,
see Doran and Larsen, 2014, Study 2). Another study
explored how people who frequently engage in eco-
friendly activities at home view themselves and their
behaviours in a vacation context (Juvan and Dolnicar,
2014). While participants interviewed in this study
were generally aware about negative environmental
consequences linked to tourism activities, they also
acknowledged that their vacation behaviours were
mostly inconsistent with their attitudes towards envir-
onmental preservation. One of the strategies to justify
such inconsistencies in retrospect was downward
social comparison (i.e. comparison with others who
are perceived as doing worse than oneself).
It has been suggested that viewing oneself more
favourable than others may hinder people from enga-
ging in pro-environmental behaviour (Leary et al.,
2011; Van Raaij, 2002). Applied to the context of tour-
ism, we propose that people who believe that they hold
more positive attitudes towards environmentally sus-
tainable tourism than the typical tourist should be less
optimistic that others will contribute their share and,
hence, be less likely to contribute themselves. More
specifically, we assume that social comparison (in
this study conceptualized as comparing own attitudes
to those of typical tourists) contributes to explaining
variance in people's willingness to pay for environmen-
tal protection when travelling, in addition to absolute
judgments of own attitudes.
Hypothesis 2 (social comparison): Favourable social
comparison will be negatively related to willingness
to pay for environmental protection.
Efficacy beliefs
If people think that environmental preservation is
important but believe that their personal behaviour
has little impact on the environment, it is unlikely
that they will act in accordance with such attitudes.
Bandura (2006) stated that ``[u]nless people believe
that they can produce desired effects by their actions,
they have little incentive to act, or to persevere in the
face of difficulties'' (p. 170). A person's beliefs about
how efficacious his or her behaviour is for achieving
desired outcomes are commonly referred to as self-
efficacy beliefs (Kerr, 1992; Van Lange et al., 1992).
Self-efficacy is assumed to be another important deter-
minant of behavioural intentions, and indirectly, of
actual behaviour (Fishbein and Cappella, 2006).
Self-efficacy beliefs may be particularly important
when people decide whether or not they should
pursue collective interests in large-scale social dilem-
mas. In line with this assumption, Kerr (1989,
Experiments 1­3) found that self-efficacy declined
with increasing numbers of people being involved in
social dilemmas and that self-efficacy was positively
related to pursuing collective interests. In an early
review of psychological determinants of global envir-
onmental change, Stern (1992) concluded that vari-
ables dealing with perceived personal control were
the only personality variables that showed systematic
relationships with environmentally relevant
Doran et al. 283
behaviours. Empirical support for the relationship
between self-efficacy and pro-environmental behav-
iour also comes from recent cross-sectional studies
(Gupta and Ogden, 2009; Hanss and Bo
¨hm, 2010).
A common finding in these studies is that a stronger
sense of self-efficacy is associated with a greater ten-
dency to engage in behaviours that foster sustainable
development (e.g. purchasing eco-friendly consump-
tion products). A novelty in Hanss and Bo
¨hm's study
(2010) was that the authors investigated self-efficacy
concerning people's perceived direct impact on sus-
tainable development (i.e. through their own actions)
and people's perceived indirect impact on sustainable
development (i.e. through encouraging others to con-
tribute to sustainable development). They found that
both aspects of sustainable development self-efficacy
predicted sustainable consumption behaviours.
Considering that self-efficacy beliefs were found to
be associated with various types of pro-environmental
behaviour, it is somewhat surprising that self-efficacy
(as conceptualized in the present study) has so far
received little attention in research on environmentally
sustainable tourism. A notable exception is a study by
Gustin and Weaver (1996) that showed that self-effi-
cacy, together with knowledge about environmental
issues and attitudes towards environmental strategies,
was positively related to people's intentions to stay in a
hotel that applies environmental strategies. Findings
from other studies further indicate that perceived
lack of ability can be used to justify personal inaction
(e.g. Hares et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2010). In the
study by Juvan and Dolnicar (2014), for example,
downward social comparison was not the only strategy
used to justify discrepancies between home and vac-
ation behaviours. Another strategy was denial of
responsibility, which is, denying personal responsibility
to take action and/or denying personal ability to
make a difference. Based upon these findings, we
assume that self-efficacy concerning environmental
preservation is positively associated with people's will-
ingness to pay for environmental protection when
travelling.
Hypothesis 3 (self-efficacy): Self-efficacy beliefs will be
positively related to willingness to pay for environmen-
tal protection.
Building upon the view that mitigating environmen-
tal problems is a collective effort, individual tourists
may derive efficacy expectations not only from judg-
ments of their own ability to make a difference but also
from the degree to which they think that tourists
together can affect the state of the environment. The
beliefs of an individual member of a group about the
group's ability to achieve desired outcomes are
referred to as collective efficacy beliefs (Bandura,
1997). Just like self-efficacy may affect behaviour on
the individual level, this type of efficacy beliefs may
determine how much effort group members put into
the pursuit of collective interests (cf. Bandura, 2000).
Homburg and Stolberg (2006) found some support for
this assumption by showing that people's engagement
in activities to cope with environmental stressors can
be predicted by collective efficacy (Studies 3 and 4)
but not by self-efficacy (Studies 1 and 2). Likewise,
Thaker (2012) found that collective efficacy predicted
the degree to which local residents engaged in behav-
iours to secure the supply of safe drinking water in
their community (e.g. participate in demonstrations,
encourage other community members to save water).
People with higher levels of collective efficacy did more
to help secure drinking water than people with low and
moderate levels of collective efficacy. Another study
that is important in this context comes from
Bonniface and Henley (2008) who used focus groups
to explore efficacy beliefs among environmental activ-
ists and non-activists. One of their findings was that
people participating in household waste management
were more likely to believe that the waste problem
could be reduced if everybody contributed their
share than people who did not participate in house-
hold waste management.
According to Bandura (2000), one way of measur-
ing collective efficacy beliefs is by asking members of a
group to judge the group's ability to jointly achieve
desired outcomes. This method of assessment takes
account of group dynamics that may influence the
functioning and efficacy of the group. With regard to
group membership, different levels of aggregation may
be distinguished (cf. Homburg and Stolberg, 2006).
For example, tourists can be grouped at very general
levels, such as tourists from a specific continent or
country, or more specific levels, such as tourists from
a specific city. In this study, we measured collective
efficacy at the highest possible level of aggregation,
that is, people's beliefs about the ability of tourists in
general to jointly help preserve the environment. We
chose this level of aggregation because many of the
environmental problems linked with tourism activities
are global (UNEP-UNWTO, 2012) and thus their
mitigation requires the cooperation by individuals
from all over the world. Based on the findings from
other domains (see above), we assume that collective
efficacy is positively associated with people's willing-
ness to pay for environmental protection when
travelling.
Hypothesis 4 (collective efficacy): Collective efficacy
beliefs will be positively related to willingness to pay
for environmental protection.

Method
Participants
A cross-sectional survey using a convenience sample
(N ¼ 358) was used to investigate the hypotheses. Data
were collected by the authors and research assistants
among domestic and international tourists visiting
Bergen, Norway. Potential participants were contacted
at waiting areas (e.g. tourist information, hotel lobby)
and recreational areas (e.g. scenic nature spots,
famous sights). After information about the study
was provided (i.e. topic, purpose and duration, confi-
dentiality, language of the questionnaire, contact infor-
mation of the project leaders), people were asked
whether they were willing to take part in the study.
Those who agreed to participate were provided with
a self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire
(English language). Completed questionnaires were
collected and the participants were asked whether
they had any questions regarding the study.
Questions were answered immediately on-site.
The sample consisted of n ¼ 183 women (51%) and
n ¼ 175 men (49%) between 18 and 83 years of age
(M ¼ 31.49, SD ¼ 13.67). Participants were from dif-
ferent continents: The majority was from Europe
(68%); thereof most participants were from
Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Sweden
and France. The second largest group was from Asia
(16%), thereof most participants were from China.
The remaining participants were from North
America (9%), Oceania (4%), South America (2%)
and Africa (1%). Although the questionnaire did not
ask specifically whether participants were domestic or
international tourists, some 11% (n ¼ 38) indicated
that they were Norwegian by nationality. This might
serve as an estimate concerning the number of domes-
tic tourists participating in this study.
Materials and procedure
In addition to questions about participants' age,
gender and nationality (see above), the questionnaire
consisted of items to measure various aspects of travel-
ling. At this point, we will only report self-report meas-
ures for willingness to pay for environmental
protection, attitudes, social comparison, self-efficacy
beliefs and collective efficacy beliefs.
Willingness to pay for environmental protection.
From a theoretical perspective (e.g. Fishbein and
Ajzen, 2010; Stern et al., 1995), stated willingness
to pay for environmental protection reflects a person's
intention to engage in a specific type of pro-environ-
mental behaviour. Three questionnaire items measur-
ing this construct were constructed for the purpose of
this study (see Table 1). Formulations resembled pre-
viously used measures of stated willingness to accept
economic sacrifices in order to protect the environ-
ment (Hedlund, 2011; Thøgersen, 2000). All three
items (i.e. WTP1-WTP3) entered a principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA; direct oblimin, listwise deletion),
Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling
adequacy ¼.68; Barlett's test of sphericity: approxi-
mate 2(3) ¼ 308.32, p <.001. One component with
an eigenvalue greater than one was retained, which
explained 69.81% of the variance in stated willingness
to pay for environmental protection. An index variable
was computed by averaging participants' answers to all
three items (see Table 2).
Attitudes. Attitudes were measured by three question-
naire items (see Table 1), adopted from Doran and
Larsen (2014). Because one aspect addressed in this
study was social comparison, these attitude items were
provided in two different variants: one to measure par-
ticipants' own attitudes and one to measure what par-
ticipants thought to be the attitudes of typical tourists.
All six items (self and typical) entered a PCA (direct
oblimin, listwise deletion), KMO ¼.75; approximate
2(15) ¼ 1039.38, p <.001. Two components with an
eigenvalue greater than one were retained, which
explained 79.12% of the variance in attitudes: one
comprising judgments of own attitudes (i.e. EAs1-
EAs3) and one comprising judgments of typical tour-
ists' attitudes (i.e. EAt1-EAt3). Index variables were
computed by averaging participants' answers to each
set of items (see Table 2).
Favourable social comparison can be measured
using direct or indirect methods of assessment (see
Alicke and Govorun, 2005; Chambers and
Windschitl, 2004). The present study used an indirect
method of assessment where participants are asked to
make separate judgments about themselves and others
(here: typical tourists). Favourable social comparison
can then be measured by subtracting judgments of
typical tourists' attitudes from judgments of own atti-
tudes (cf. Alicke and Govorun, 2005). Higher positive
scores were interpreted as stronger contrasts, that is,
people view their own attitudes more favourably than
those of typical tourists. We further used two question-
naire versions that differed with respect to the order in
which the item measures were presented. One part of
the participants was first asked to judge their own atti-
tudes and then the attitudes of typical tourists (i.e. self
! typical, n ¼ 163). Another part of the participants
first judged the attitudes of typical tourists and then
their own attitudes (i.e. typical ! self, n ¼ 195).
Efficacy beliefs. Self-efficacy beliefs were measured by
means of three questionnaire items (see Table 1).

Each item consisted of a statement about the personal
ability to make a difference.1 One item (i.e. SE3_i) was
inspired by a questionnaire item of sustainable devel-
opment self-efficacy used by Hanss and Bo
¨hm (2010)
and measured the perceived indirect impact on envir-
onmental preservation through encouraging other
tourists to travel environmentally friendly. Two items
(i.e. SE1_d, SE2_d) were newly formulated for the
purpose of this study and dealt with the perceived
direct impact on environmental outcomes, such as
protecting wildlife or reducing carbon emissions. The
three items entered a PCA (direct oblimin, listwise
deletion), KMO ¼.67; approximate 2(3) ¼ 160.39,
p <.001. One component with an eigenvalue greater
than one was retained, explaining 60.86% of the vari-
ance in self-efficacy beliefs. An index variable was
computed by averaging participants' answers to these
items (see Table 2).
Collective efficacy beliefs were measured by four
questionnaire items (see Table 1). While some items
(i.e. CE3_d, CE4_i) were newly formulated for the
purpose of this study, other items (i.e. CE1_d,
CE2_d) were adapted from Homburg and Stolberg
(2006) but adjusted to measure collective efficacy in
the context of tourism. Three of these items consisted
of a statement that tourists can together help solving
environmental problems, such as pollution or global
climate change (i.e. CE1_d-CE3_d). The fourth item
dealt with the ability of tourists to indirectly mitigate
environmental problems through encouraging an
increasing number of people to travel in an environ-
mentally friendly manner (i.e. CE4_i). One compo-
nent with an eigenvalue greater than one was
retained when the four items entered a PCA (direct
oblimin, listwise deletion), KMO ¼.83; approximate
2(6) ¼ 756.54, p <.001. This component explained
74.73% of the variance in collective efficacy beliefs.
An index variable was computed by averaging partici-
pants' answers to the four items (see Table 2).
Data handling and analysis
Some participants did not respond to all items (n ¼ 24,
7%) and therefore had missing values on some of the
variables. Missing values were deleted listwise in the
analyses. Data were analysed with the statistical pack-
age IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 21.
The correlational structure of each construct was
explored by means of principal component analyses
and index variables were computed for each of the
constructs (see Materials and procedure). Index
scores were also computed for those participants who
had missing values on some of the variables and thus
were excluded from the principal component analyses.
Two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA)
examined social comparison outcomes. Correlation
and regression analyses tested the hypothesized asso-
ciations. Preconditions for performing multiple regres-
sion analysis (cf. Field, 2013) were satisfied (i.e. no
significant outliers, imperfect multicollinearity of pre-
dictors, unbounded criterion variable, independent
and normally distributed residuals, homoscedasticity
and linearity, non-zero variances).2
Results
Analyses of social comparison outcomes
We conducted a 2 (social comparison) Â 2 (item order)
mixed ANOVA with social comparison (self vs. typical)
as a within-subjects and item order (self ! typical vs.
tourists ! self) as a between-subjects factor. There was
a significant main effect for social comparison, F(1,
350) ¼ 577.14, p <.001, partial 2 ¼ .62, indicating
favourable social comparison in the sense that partici-
pants perceived themselves as holding more positive
attitudes towards environmentally sustainable tourism
than typical tourists. There was also a significant inter-
action effect between social comparison and item
order, F(1, 350) ¼ 50.03, p <.001, partial 2 ¼ .13,
indicating that the magnitude of favourable social com-
parison varied depending on the order by which the
item measures were presented. Participants who first
answered items about themselves (Mself

SDself
¼ 0.64; Mtypical
¼ 4.09, SDtypical
¼ 1.46) showed
stronger favourable social comparison (i.e. greater dif-
ference scores) than participants who first answered
items about typical tourists (Mtypical
¼ 4.82,
SDtypical
¼ 1.33; Mself
¼ 6.10, SDself
¼ 0.98). For the
correlation and regression analyses (see below), we
pooled the data and analysed responses of all partici-
pants together, independent of which questionnaire
version the participants had filled out.3
Associations between willingness to pay for
environmental protection, attitudes, social
comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and
collective efficacy beliefs
In order to investigate how well attitudes, social com-
parison, self-efficacy beliefs and collective efficacy
beliefs explain willingness to pay for environmental
protection, we first examined bivariate correlations
between the index variables (see Table 3). Attitudes
(self), social comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and col-
lective efficacy beliefs were all positively and signifi-
cantly associated with willingness to pay for
environmental protection. Attitudes (typical) were
not significantly associated with willingness to pay for
Doran et al. 287
environmental protection. In order to check the
robustness of these findings, we also calculated partial
correlations with item order being controlled for. Since
none of the hypothesized associations were affected
substantially by this procedure, these results are not
discussed further.
Explaining willingness to pay for
environmental protection with attitudes,
social comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and
collective efficacy beliefs
Following up on results from the correlation analyses,
we also computed a hierarchical regression analysis
(see Table 4). In the first step, attitudes (self) and
social comparison were entered as independent vari-
ables. The model explained about 13% of the variance
in willingness to pay for environmental protection,
with only attitudes (self) being significantly associated
with willingness to pay for environmental protection
(positive association). In the second step, both types
of efficacy beliefs were added as independent variables.
This improved the model significantly, R2
change
¼ .17,
F(2, 343) ¼ 41.88, p <.001. The extended model now
explained about 30% of the variance in willingness to
pay for environmental protection. With the exception
of social comparison, all other independent variables
were significantly associated with willingness to pay for
environmental protection (positive associations). A
closer inspection of standardized regression coeffi-
cients further indicated that stated willingness to pay
for environmental protection appears particularly sen-
sitive to changes in collective efficacy beliefs.
In sum, these findings provide support for
Hypothesis 1 (attitudes), Hypothesis 3 (self-efficacy)
and Hypothesis 4 (collective efficacy). The data did
not support Hypothesis 2 (social comparison).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the
degree to which tourists are willing to pay for environ-
mental protection can be explained by a combination
of attitudes, social comparison, self-efficacy beliefs and
collective efficacy beliefs. The decision to include
social comparison as an independent variable was
based on the assumption that people who believe
that they hold more positive attitudes towards envir-
onmentally sustainable tourism than the typical tourist
may doubt that others will contribute their share, and
therefore be hesitant about contributing themselves.
While social comparison did not explain extra variance
in stated willingness to pay for environmental protec-
tion, absolute judgments of own attitudes as well as
self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs were all posi-
tively and significantly associated with stated willing-
ness to pay for environmental protection.
Our findings corroborate recent studies indicating
favourable self-views when people compare themselves
with others on dimensions related to issues of environ-
mentally sustainable tourism (Doran and Larsen,
2014; Juvan and Dolnicar, 2014). However, and con-
trary to our hypothesis, this type of social comparison
did not explain variance in willingness to pay for envir-
onmental protection additionally to own attitudes.
One possible explanation is that social comparison of
attitudes is a matter of retrospectively justifying coun-
ter-attitudinal behaviour rather than being decisive in
situations where people choose between different
travel alternatives. The underlying assumption here is
that perceived discrepancies between own attitudes
towards environmental preservation and actual travel
behaviours may lead to cognitive dissonance (i.e. feel-
ings of discomfort caused by inconsistencies between a
person's behaviours, attitudes or beliefs; Festinger,
1957). Based on semi-structured interviews with
environmental activists, Juvan and Dolnicar (2014)
concluded that tourists may rely on different types of
beliefs (or strategies) to re-establish cognitive conson-
ance, one of which they identified as comparisons with
people who are thought of as behaving less environ-
mentally friendly. It can be speculated that similar pro-
cesses take place in situations where people decide not
to pay an additional cost for environmental protection
even though environmental preservation is important
to them (see also Doran and Larsen, 2014).
As mentioned earlier, decisions to pay for environ-
mental protection can be regarded as a large-scale
social dilemma. In these situations, people may have
stronger doubts regarding their personal ability to
make a difference (cf. Kerr, 1989) and perhaps also
regarding the ability of the collective to achieve desired
outcomes. One reason could be that in larger groups
people are less familiar with the other group members
involved, and predictions of group dynamics that may
affect the performance of the group are thus difficult.
Following this line of reasoning, we assumed that
uncertainties concerning the ability and effectiveness
of oneself and others in producing a desired outcome
(e.g. environmental preservation) may be particularly
decisive. Consistent with this view, our findings
showed that self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs
were both positively associated with willingness to pay
for environmental protection. Targeting efficacy beliefs
could therefore be one promising approach of
encouraging people to travel in an environmentally
sustainable manner. One way of strengthening percep-
tions of efficacy could be to reduce the perceived size
of the social dilemma through informational cam-
paigns that implement strategies of scope reduction
(cf. Hanss, 2012). Scope reduction (Wiener and
Doescher, 1991) refers to breaking down large-scale,
global challenges (e.g. environmental sustainability,
mitigating global climate change) into small-scale,
local problems (e.g. extinction of local species, air pol-
lution at a specific tourist destination). Applied to the
context of tourism, scope reduction allows communi-
cating environmental problems as small-scale social
dilemmas and may thereby help increase perceptions
of self-efficacy and collective efficacy in the tourism
domain.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that exam-
ined different types of efficacy beliefs in the context of
environmentally sustainable tourism. While both effi-
cacy constructs explained separate amounts of vari-
ance in willingness to pay for environmental
protection, stated willingness was particularly sensitive
to changes in collective efficacy. This finding supports
the view that the degree to which people perceive tour-
ists as a group to be capable of helping to protect the
environment may motivate reparative actions, and
potentially more so, than self-efficacy (see also
Homburg and Stolberg, 2006). One way of
strengthening perceptions of collective efficacy could
be to provide people with information about the
accomplishments of similar others (i.e. vicarious
experiences; Bandura, 1997). For instance, providing
examples of tourist destinations in which the coopera-
tive behaviour of many individuals (e.g. using public
transportation instead of renting a car) contributed to
mitigating environmental problems (e.g. air pollution)
may enhance perceptions of collective efficacy in the
tourism domain. Another option for strengthening
perceptions of collective efficacy is to provide evalu-
ative feedback that endorses the group's ability for
achieving the desired outcome (i.e. verbal persuasion;
Bandura, 1997). For instance, people who decide on
whether to pay extra in order to protect the
Doran et al. 289
environment (e.g. via participation in carbon offsetting
schemes) could be confronted with information illus-
trating how the joint contributions of many individuals
would potentially benefit the state of the environment
(e.g. global reduction in carbon dioxide emissions).
The potential impact of using verbal persuasion as a
means of strengthening perceptions of efficacy
depends on whether the persuading actor is perceived
as knowledgeable and credible (Bandura, 1997).
Willingness to pay for environmental protection
may not only depend on beliefs that people (or tourists
as a group) can make a difference through their own
actions but also that these actions can serve as an
inspiration to others (cf. Hanss and Bo
¨hm, 2010).
The present study therefore included measures for
direct and indirect components of efficacy beliefs. In
both cases (self- and collective efficacy), items measur-
ing each of the two components loaded on the same
factor. This indicates that the belief that people can
encourage others to contribute their share (e.g. by set-
ting a good example) also seems to be an important
aspect of efficacy beliefs in connection with environ-
mentally sustainable tourism. One way to increase
people's perceived impact on the behaviour of other
tourists may be to increase the social visibility of
cooperative behaviours, thereby creating social norms
to join in (cf. Hanss and Bo
¨hm, 2013). For example,
tourists who make economic sacrifices in order to help
preserve the environment could be provided with an
eye-catching sticker or a tag to be attached to their
luggage whilst travelling. Empirical support for this
view comes from Goldstein et al. (2008) who demon-
strated in two field experiments that making pro-envir-
onmental behaviours public can have powerful effects
on people's behaviours. For example, when hotel
guests received an appeal to reuse their towels in
order to help protecting the environment, and, in add-
ition, were told that other hotel guests also had reused
their towels (i.e. social norm), towel reuse was greater
than when hotel guests only received the appeal to
reuse. Illustrations of this type of empirical research
may also be used in informational campaigns to fur-
ther convince tourists that their own actions may have
an actual impact on the behaviour of others.
Limitations and future directions
There are some limitations to this study that could be
addressed in future research. First, cross-sectional data
were used to investigate associations between atti-
tudes, efficacy beliefs, and willingness to pay for envir-
onmental protection. Although there is empirical
evidence to suggest that these variables influence
behaviour in the proposed direction, cross-sectional
data are nonetheless insufficient to test for causal
relationships. It follows that, based on the findings of
this study, interpretations regarding how to encourage
people to travel in an environmentally sustainable
manner must be taken with caution.
Second, behavioural intentions are often regarded
as the main determinant of actual behaviour (e.g.
Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010). Previous studies (e.g.
Hanss and Bo
¨hm, 2013) have shown, however, that
intentions are not perfectly related to sustainable con-
sumption behaviour. Future studies should thus ide-
ally include measures of actual behaviour as well. One
option could be to include self-reports of behaviour,
for example, by asking people to fill out travel diaries.
This type of approach would also produce longitudinal
data that allow for detecting changes in the focal vari-
ables over time.
Third, collective efficacy beliefs were measured at
the highest possible level of aggregation, that is, beliefs
about the ability of tourists in general to jointly help
preserve the environment. It could be that people may
not consider themselves as being part of such a het-
erogeneous and large group and, as a consequence,
report lower levels of collective efficacy. Future studies
may benefit from choosing more specific levels of
aggregation in order to clarify the relationship between
group size and collective efficacy (cf. Homburg and
Stolberg, 2006). This could be done, for instance, by
referring to tourists at a certain destination or tourists
with similar socio-demographic profiles.
Fourth, the indirect component of efficacy beliefs
was measured with only one item for each construct,
which is, encouraging others to travel environmentally
friendly themselves. Future studies that employ a more
comprehensive measurement (e.g. multiple items)
would further facilitate the understanding of how per-
ceptions of efficacy may influence decisions to travel in
an environmentally sustainable manner.
Despite these limitations, this study provides
important insights into individual characteristics of
people who are willing to contribute their share in
helping to protect the environment. From a research
perspective, we hope that our findings will stimulate
further research (in particular experimental studies)
into the roles of self-efficacy and collective efficacy as
antecedents of pro-environmental behaviour and, in
particular, with regard to choices of environmentally
sustainable travel options. An important area for
future investigations is to examine whether targeting
perceptions of efficacy offers a fruitful approach for
encouraging people to consider environmental issues
when making travel choices, and whether efficacy
beliefs on a collective level are more decisive than
those on an individual level. From a managerial per-
spective, the findings of such studies may inform those
involved in the planning and implementation of
290 Tourism and Hospitality Research 15(4)
informational strategies that seek to promote behav-
ioural change among tourists. For example, previous
research suggests that people often fail to ascribe per-
sonal responsibility for solving environmental prob-
lems associated with tourism activities (Hares et al.,
2010; Juvan and Dolnicar, 2014). Consequently, and
in line with our present findings, communications
about the necessity to take reparative actions may
benefit from shifting the focus away from emphasizing
personal responsibility towards positioning each indi-
vidual tourist as being part of a larger group that shares
a collective responsibility (see also Moisander, 2007).

Notes
1. This conceptualization of self-efficacy is similar to the
concept of perceived consumer effectiveness which
refers to ``a domain-specific belief that the efforts of an
individual can make a difference in the solution to a prob-
lem'' (Ellen et al., 1991: 103).
2. Variance inflation factors ranged from 1.18 to 1.64 and
tolerance statistics ranged from .61 to .85.
3. Supplementary analyses using independent t-tests
showed that only responses for the two attitude measures
were affected by item order; for judgments of own atti-
tudes: t(322.87) ¼ 3.93, p <.001; for judgments of typical
tourists' attitudes: t(346) ¼ À4.78, p <.001. Responses
for the other construct measures (i.e. willingness to pay,
self-efficacy, collective efficacy) were similar in both
groups: ts < 1, ps > 0.35.
