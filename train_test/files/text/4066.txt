Introduction
U.S. higher education institutions provide instruction for
nearly 19 million students in a large variety of academic
disciplines and degree levels.1 Institutions with a for-profit
tax status educate 2 million of these students.2 Since the
election of President Barack Obama in November 2008,
media portrayals of for-profits have seen violent swings
among neutral, positive, and even intensely negative views.
Kingdon (2003) explores how mass media influences
agenda setting and public policy formation. He concludes
that the primary role of the media is to facilitate information
exchange among policy promoters, policy makers, and the
public. He argues that this indirect approach is necessary
because there is too much information and not enough mech-
anisms to prioritize it for policy analysis. Similarly, Bennett's
study of media and public policy found that stories become
news as media outlets personalize individual subjects outside
their social contexts and fragment details from general pat-
terns (Macaulay, Friedman, & Mertz, 2007). Although media
coverage of U.S. higher education institutions has shown
great variation, it predictably demonstrates a combination of
Kingdon's information exchange with Bennett's personaliza-
tion and fragmentation.
Although this media coverage has occurred in public
view, two sets of forces have been at work behind the scenes.
First is the U.S. government, including the U.S. Senate, the
U.S. Department of Education (USDE), and the U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO). Second is the
for-profit institutions themselves. This case study explores
one fundamental question: How did these forces drive dra-
matic media coverage shifts in the first 2 years of the Obama
administration?
Method
The methodology for this case study was a two-phase, tex-
tual analysis of media coverage concerning for-profit higher
education companies. The first phase built on a relevant
query of the Lexus Nexus academic database, which returned
78 new stories from November 2008 through December
2010.3 The author coded each of these stories as positive,
neutral, and negative. Figure 1 provides typical examples.
The second phase was a software text analysis using Tropes
version 7.2.4 The Tropes program provides an objective mech-
anism to code content of news stories. Using electronic ver-
sions of news articles, which were grouped by category,
Tropes determined the frequency of terms and the concentra-
tion of connections among the terms.5 The output was a series
of graphs depicting the action orientation of terms on one axis
and the concentration of connections among terms on the
other.6 The author used this output to generate a summary of
the key themes from each category of news articles.7
Because of data limitations within Tropes, the author
eliminated some news articles from the text analysis. If the
full set of articles in a category was too large, the author
removed the shortest article and continued until the collec-
tion met Tropes limitations. Across all categories, the Tropes
analysis covered 78.8% of the articles (weighted by
word count), with a minimum of 71.0% and a maximum of
91.7%. This method sacrificed full article coverage to gain

All-Out War:A Case Study in Media
Coverage of For-Profit Higher Education
Tim Gramling1
Abstract
About 19 million students attend U.S. higher education institutions. Institutions with a for-profit tax status educate 2 million
of these students.Since the election of President Barack Obama in November 2008,media portrayals of for-profits have seen
violent swings among neutral, positive, and even intensely negative views.Two sets of forces have been at work behind the
scenes. First is the U.S. government, including the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Department of Education, and the U.S. Government
Accountability Office. Second are the for-profit institutions themselves. This case study explores how these forces drove
dramatic media coverage shifts in the first two years of the Obama administration.

Background
The election of Barack Obama in November 2008 promised
to bring sweeping changes in American politics. In July
2009, President Obama placed a spotlight on higher educa-
tion when he announced a national goal for America to have
the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by
2020 (American Council on Education, 2009). But higher
education was not a popular topic in news coverage, hence,
for-profits were not in the news very much. Figure 2 shows
a very light frequency of stories about for-profits from
early November 2008 through April 2010. But something
happened in May 2010 to capture the attention of news out-
lets across the United States. The frequency of stories
increased to virtually constant coverage each week. The
intensity of stories increased as well, with many weeks gar-
nering mentions of for-profits on an almost daily basis.
These developments raise the question of what happened.
How did the topic of for-profits rise from virtually no cover-
age in November 2008 to nearly nonstop coverage by
November 2010?

throughout this period. There is one exception, which occurred
just after Thanksgiving 2009. News writers in the compact
city of Durham, NC, and the tiny town of Brattleboro, VT,
agreed that a significant number of low-income students were
using Pell Grant dollars to attend for-profits. However, a
writer in Grand Rapids, MI, noted simply that for-profits were
growing in their area. Perhaps it was the somewhat neutral
tone in this article that stamped out widespread consensus. At
any rate, negative messages about for-profits did not reverber-
ate nationwide.
The Tropes text analysis provided similar findings. Profit
was the most commonly used term in both negative and
neutral-to-positive stories. Similarly, both featured education
as a concentrated theme. Although negative stories placed
concentrated emphasis on student loans, neutral-to-positive
stories focused on the money for-profits spend to deliver
education. Finally, negative stories often mentioned the per-
centage of low-income students who did not complete
school. This theme was absent from neutral-to-positive sto-
ries, which instead positioned for-profits as providing a ser-
vice to students.
All-Out War
All of this changed in May 2010. Figure 4 outlines three
distinct phases of news coverage, which the author describes
as recriminations, resistance, and recalcitrance. These
phases suggest an all-out war in the press. On one side were
the for-profits. On the other hand were the U.S. Senate, the
USDE, and the GAO.
Recriminations
On May 6, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer published a
lengthy, 2,100-word article titled "For-Profit Colleges Leave
Many Students in Debt." This article featured the story of a
21-year-old student at a Philadelphia for-profit who left
school about halfway through her bachelor's program. For
her efforts, this student faced US$100,000 in debt with a job
at a delivery service that paid only US$8 per hour--and no
degree. The school had explained that she could expect to
incur about US$75,000 in debt during her studies. Still, she
secured private loans that helped contribute to her debt. This
article even provided the school's point of view: It serves a
challenging population of students who have struggled with
college before, it walks through loans and debt as part of
student orientations, and it has a number of support systems
to help struggling students. Still, this article succinctly
articulated the battle lines of what would become an all-out
war as follows: "Advocates say the schools help low-
income, less-prepared students fulfill their dreams. Critics
contend they prey on low-performing students and load
them with untenable debt" (Synder, 2010).
Although this article characterized advocates as helping
low-income students, no news outlet would pick up on this
theme for several months. The immediate aftermath of the
Inquirer story was that news outlets in Dayton, Atlanta, and
Kansas City repeated the critics' perspective that for-profits
were predators taking advantage of low-performing students.
Kingdon's (2003) information exchange appeared to be at
work, raising awareness of this critical viewpoint.

As if on cue, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing on
June 24, 2010, titled "Emerging Risk? An Overview of the
Federal Investment in For-Profit Education" (U.S. Senate,
2010a). This hearing sounded the usual critical theme of for-
profits as predators, and it featured unflattering testimony
from a representative from the USDE. This hearing triggered
three negative news stories that same day. It also triggered
the solitary neutral story during this entire period of recrimi-
nations. The same New York Times writer who wrote a
sharply critical story on June 24, 2010, titled "Battle Lines
Drawn Over For-Profit Colleges" wrote a shorter, neutral
article that same day, explaining that "For-Profit Colleges
Find New Market Niche." The niche in this article is a mem-
orandum of understanding with the California community
college system. This agreement allowed students who could
find an available course at the community college to take
that same course online at a for-profit university. Though the
article was neutral, the author noted that "[a]t the academic
senate's spring meeting, faculty members voted to urge the
chancellor to withdraw from the memorandum of under-
standing" (Lewin, 2010). The battle lines in this war had
become very clear.
Similar recriminations continued from late June through
early August 2010, with negative stories in Dayton and Tulsa.
There was also a damaging article in the Los Angeles Times
on July 25, 2010, titled "For-Profit Colleges May Be a Bust
for Taxpayers." As if building on this sentiment, the U.S.
Senate HELP Committee arranged a follow-up hearing on
August 4, 2010 (U.S. Senate, 2010b). The key note of this
hearing was the publication of a GAO report titled "For-Profit
Colleges: Undercover Testing Finds Colleges Encouraged
Fraud and Engaged in Deceptive and Questionable Marketing
Practices." This report revealed videotapes from undercover
investigators who visited 15 for-profits across the United
States. In its written report, the GAO "found that 4 colleges
encouraged fraudulent practices and that all 15 made decep-
tive or otherwise questionable statements to GAO's under-
cover applicants." (U.S. Senate, 2010b) But the videotapes
were very damaging, leading the New York Times to declare

"For-Profit Colleges Mislead, Report Finds" and the Christian
Science Monitor to exclaim "For-profit colleges hit with
claims of fraud, aggressive recruiting"--both on the day of
the hearing.
A Tropes analysis confirms the dynamic at work in this
phase. For neutral-to-positive stories, college was the pri-
mary actor, and the most common expression was the memo-
randum of understanding with the California community
college system. Conversely, negative stories featured com-
pany as the primary actor and mentioned the term profit most
often. In addition, students choosing to attend for-profits
appeared prominently in neutral-to-positive stories. But
these stories ignored a theme that negative stories spot-
lighted--the impact of student loans.
Resistance
The August 4, 2010, U.S. Senate HELP Committee hearing
appears to have been a last straw for the for-profit higher
education industry. To this point, for-profits appeared
stunned by the constant assaults and the one-sided portrayals
of their schools and students in the press. As illustrated in
Figure 4, the period of recriminations featured 15 negative
stories about for-profits--the equivalent of one per week. In
addition, even the one neutral story during this period said
nothing about the advocate position in this war--that for-
profits help low-income and less-prepared students. The tide
was clearly about to change, as this war entered a period of
resistance.
The first salvo came predictably from the Washington
Post. This company owns Kaplan University, one of the
nation's largest for-profits. The Washington Post issued a
news-oriented article on August 17, 2010, titled "For-Profit
Higher-Education Providers Resist Regulatory Action."As
the Post entered the fray, for-profits generally understood the
importance of sounding a note of opposition to the
Philadelphia Inquirer's May story. Though they did not find
a sympathetic audience with the Inquirer, they were success-
ful in placing a story in the cross-state rival Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette titled "For-Profit Schools Say Loan Data Doesn't
Tell Whole Story" in the Business section on August 17,
2010. The USDE gave some ground in the war by allowing
an interview for this article:
"What we know is that there are many for-profit schools
that are doing a great job of educating students, and we
know there are some bad actors who have been perpe-
trating fraud and deceit," said Justin Hamilton, an edu-
cation department spokesman, in a telephone interview.
(Staley & Hechinger, 2010)
It would seem that the Philadelphia Inquirer was exposed.
In preparing its story, this news outlet stressed an individu-
al's sad story about student loan debt while omitting the full
context. This is what Bennett described as the media practice
of personalization.
For-profits finally found their voice as an advocate for
low-income, less-prepared students. They successfully
earned neutral coverage from the New York Times national
desk and even placed two positive editorials in this outlet.
Perhaps more important, they saw positive news-desk cover-
age during this period from the Denver Post, the Miami
Herald, the Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville, and the
USA Today. In all, there were nine positive and eight neutral
stories about for-profits in the period of resistance.
Furthermore, although negative news remained constant at
about one story per week, neutral-to-positive stories outnum-
bered negative ones for the first time. This trend continued
until Thanksgiving 2010.
Tropes analysis confirms a dramatic shift in the content of
neutral-to-positive and negative stories during this phase.
Both mentioned profit most often. But neutral-to-positive sto-
ries sounded broad themes across for-profit locations nation-
wide, whereas negative stories centered on a single location.
Specifically, neutral-to-positive stories mentioned political
contributions to Democrats as the most prominent actor. The
most highly concentrated topic in these stories was the USDE
and its release of trial, 3-year cohort default rates. However,
negative stories mentioned recruiting activities by a single
Utah for-profit as the most prominent actor and also as the
most highly concentrated topic. In addition, while negative
stories emphasized money as the broadest unifying theme,
neutral-to-positive stories stressed employment outcomes.
Recalcitrance
For-profits may have felt justified in taking a break from this
war. President Obama characterized the November 2010
elections, in which Republicans took control of the House of
Representatives and seriously eroded the Democratic major-
ity in the Senate, as a "shellacking (MacNeil/Lehrer
Productions, 2010)." The momentum of news coverage
across the country had achieved a near equilibrium. But
rather than conceding defeat, critics of for-profits appeared
as determined as ever. The first signal of recalcitrance was
a November 24, 2010, article in the Pittsburgh Tribune
Review titled "For-Profit Schools Called Subprime
Opportunity." This was the most incendiary language used
to date by either side of this war.
This language is also typical of what Bennett described as
fragmentation. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review provided iso-
lated facts about student lending outside their social context.
By late 2010, the United States was in the throes of a chal-
lenging recession. It is widely understood that demand for
higher education, especially among for-profits, tends to
increase in a recession and decrease in a recovery.8 Yet the
coverage in this article did not account for the industry's
countercyclical nature in its analysis.
6 SAGE Open
This period just as easily could be called "the battle of
Pittsburgh." It is interesting that the Philadelphia Inquirer
had been largely silent since the May 2010 story that started
the war. This was no coincidence; by Thanksgiving 2010, the
Inquirer was knee-deep in covering two city commission
scandals. One was a Philadelphia Deputy City Commissioner
who resigned after 27 years because of city charter violations
(Brennan, 2010). The other was a Montgomery County so-
called "breakfastgate" scandal, where commissioners appar-
ently met illegally outside commission meetings (Roebuck,
2010). With Philadelphia outlets distracted, 5 of the 13 sto-
ries during this period came from Pittsburgh in either the
Tribune Review or the Post-Gazette.
But if this was a battle, it was not hotly contested. Nearly
two thirds of the stories during this period was negative, and
four of the five Pittsburgh press stories were negative as
well. To be sure, the New York Times and the USA Today
posted no stories about for-profits. In addition, perhaps most
telling, there were no hearings, investigations, or public
statements by the U.S. Senate, the USDE, or the GAO.
By this phase, the Tropes analysis reflects a clear dichot-
omy between neutral-to-positive and negative stories. Profit
was the only commonality, as it was the most frequently used
term across all stories. College was the primary actor in
neutral-to-positive articles, whereas companies and profits
held this position for negative stories. In addition, for the
first time, the two categories had directly opposed portrayals
of students and schools. Students received concentrated
focus in neutral-to-positive articles, with schools connecting
to a number of underlying concepts. The reverse was true in
negative stories, where schools took center stage with stu-
dents as the broadly connected notion.

Retractions and Retreats
January 2011 saw renewed interest in for-profits. But this
time, the war had taken a different turn with the publication
of two pivotal articles. First was the Village Voice retraction
of a negative article it published on January 5, 2011, titled
"For-Profit Blues: The Explosion of For-Profit `Proprietary'
Colleges, Some NYC Teachers Charge, Is Leaving Too
Many Low-Income Students Without Degrees--and With a
Pile of Debt." The Voice confirmed that the writer fabricated
his sources (Stoeffel, 2011). In one instance, he fabricated a
student who supposedly left a for-profit college with a great
deal of debt but without a degree. In a more troubling
instance, he fabricated a GAO spokesperson who suppos-
edly confirmed some of the details. This retraction under-
mined the GAO's position in this war and gave for-profits
significant ammunition to raise questions about the motives
of critical news coverage.
A second pivotal article was the Chicago Tribune's
January 10, 2011, article titled "For-Profit Colleges Fight
Negative Federal Report: Coalition Sues Education
Department Over Claims Industry Uses Deceptive Practices."
The federal lawsuit alleges that the GAO has not responded
to a Freedom of Information Act request concerning its
August 2010 report. That report featured prominently in the
recriminations stage mentioned above. This article is pivotal
because it made national news of GAO revisions to its
August 2010 report. This revision actually took place on
November 30, 2010, but it went largely unnoticed by the
press. The revisions suggest that the undercover investiga-
tion videos did not tell the whole story (Yerak, 2010). In a
sense, the GAO had to retreat from its prior position. This
marked the second story in less than 1 week that undermined
the GAO and its damaging report on for-profits.
The first 2 weeks of 2011 saw for-profit critics forced into
a retraction and a retreat. This dynamic has persisted through
8 SAGE Open
April 2011, with for-profit critics defending their prior posi-
tions and proponents placing a large spotlight on every
reversal. Still, no voices have emerged to suggest common
ground between empowering lower-income and less-pre-
pared students to pursue their dreams while also protecting
low-performing students from predatory practices.
Conclusion
The Philadelphia Inquirer touched off an all-out war
between for-profit institutions of higher education and U.S.
government forces determined to control them. In a sense,
this war is symptomatic of the great divide in the U.S. soci-
ety between conservative and progressive thought.
Conservatives are willing to give people a chance to suc-
ceed, though they seem less sympathetic to the plight of
those who fail. In the language of this war, they support for-
profits and their mission of providing a chance of success for
lower-income, less-prepared students. However, they lack
suggestions for how to address the debt load borne by those
who do not succeed.
However, progressives trust government nonprofit entities
much more than private for-profits of any kind--including
and especially higher education institutions. In the language of
this war, they desire to protect low-performing students from
for-profit predators at any and all costs. But they lack perspec-
tives on enabling students to make their own choices about
where and whether to pursue college education.
Neither side of this war has maintained the upper hand
since it began in May 2010. It would seem that the war will
continue as long as conservatives and progressives fail to
find common ground that places decision making in the
hands of students while establishing effective quality control
of for-profits. This will give the news media plenty to cover,
as it facilitates information exchange, on one hand, while it
employs personalization and fragmentation, on the other.

example, the fiscal 2003 annual report of DeVry, Inc. mentions how
declines in the technology sector of the economy drove double-digit
declines in new technology student enrollments (DeVry, 2003). This
was typical of the for-profit higher-education industry.
