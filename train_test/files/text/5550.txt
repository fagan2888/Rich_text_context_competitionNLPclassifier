Abstract
Objective: To identify the unique clinical features and biological markers of lung cancer-associated
stroke.
Methods: We recruited 102 patients with lung cancer plus stroke, 102 with lung cancer, and
102 with stroke. Detailed information was analysed and compared among groups.
Results: The groups were age-matched. Patients with lung cancer plus stroke showed multiple
lesions involving multiple cerebral artery territories on magnetic resonance imaging, compared
with stroke-alone patients. These patients also had a poorer modified Rankin Scale score at
30 days, and high mortality (18.6%). Patients with lung cancer plus stroke had a higher incidence of
metastasis, and higher blood levels of D-dimer, CA125 and CA199 compared with patients with
lung cancer alone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of D-dimer, CA125
and CA199 were independently related to lung cancer-associated stroke.
Conclusion: Elevated plasma D-dimer, CA125 and CA199 may be independent risk factors for
and biomarkers of lung cancer-associated stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of
death and the leading cause of disability
worldwide.1­3 Ischemic stroke is the most
common type of stroke, and its management
and treatment differ from those of haemor-
rhagic stroke.4,5 Risk factors associated with
ischaemic stroke include high blood pressure,

obesity and diabetes mellitus, which require
different management strategies.6,7
Cancer is a leading cause of death in both
more and less economically developed coun-
tries.8,9 Although ischemic stroke is not a
major cause of cancer-related death, it is
frequently observed in cancer patients,10­12
and optimal stroke prevention and manage-
ment measures in cancer patients may have
significant bearing on their long-term sur-
vival.13 The incidence of ischemic stroke in
cancer patients is significantly higher than in
the general population,14­16 suggesting that
cancer may contribute to stroke develop-
ment. This specific stroke subset is referred
to as ``cancer-associated stroke''.13 Several
studies have reported correlations between
cancer-associated stroke and high blood
levels of D-dimer, the occurrence of multiple
lesions, and the absence of traditional stroke
risk factors.13,14,17 Although cancers com-
prise a heterogeneous group of disorders
with diverse pathologies and varied clinical
characteristics, research into a specific type
of cancer and its associated stroke might
help us to understand the clinical features
and pathogenesis of cancer-associated
strokes in general.
Lung cancer is the most common type of
cancer among men and is also associated
with the highest mortality, while it has the
third highest incidence and second highest
mortality among women.18 Although the
incidence of stroke is significantly higher in
patients with lung cancer,19 the correlation
is not universally accepted because of the
small sample sizes of the relevant studies.
Furthermore, studies investigating lung
cancer-associated stroke (LCAS) have been
limited. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to
speculate that strokes occurring in some
patients with lung cancer may be associated
with the lung cancer itself, though it is
unclear if such LCAS has unique clinical
features and unique biomarkers.
To overcome this knowledge gap, the
present study retrospectively investigated a
relatively large dataset of patients with LCAS
and analysed the clinical characteristics of
this disease entity with respect to its clinical
features and biological markers.
Patients and methods
Patient selection
All patients were recruited from the First
Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical
University between January 2003 and
December 2014. The diagnostic criteria for
active lung cancer were adopted according
to Navi et al.20. Active lung cancer was
diagnosed on the basis of histopathology of
lung biopsy specimens. The criteria for
active disease included failure to achieve
clinical cure standards, confirmation of
cancer recurrence, or occurrence of meta-
static lesions. The diagnosis of acute cere-
bral infarction was based on the American
Heart Association diagnostic criteria for
cerebral infarction,21 i.e., patients presenting
with sudden-onset of slurring speech, par-
alysis and numbness of limbs, or other focal
neurological deficits. Computed tomog-
raphy (CT) images also showed no cerebral
haemorrhage and magnetic resonance
(MRI) images showed hyperintense lesions
on T2 and diffusion-weighted images. The
aetiology of cerebral infarction was deter-
mined according to TOAST criteria.22
The diagnosis of LCAS was slightly
revised, based on several reports.14,17,23
The coexistence of both lung cancer and
stroke in the same patient may be coinci-
dental, and the stroke may be not associated
with the lung cancer. To rule out this
possibility as far as possible, lung cancer
patients with stroke who also had high risk
factors for stroke, such as elevated blood
pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes or
hypercholesterolemia were not considered
to have LCAS, given that the observed
stroke in such patients was more likely to
have been caused by these factors than by
their lung cancer. LCAS in the present study
1484 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
was therefore defined as the occurrence of
stroke in patients with active lung cancer
and an apparent absence of common
risk factors. All patients were assessed by
three independent experts from oncology,
neurology and neuro-imaging, who were not
otherwise associated with the planning and
conduct of the study. The study protocol
was approved by the Ethics Committee at
the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi
Medical University (No 2013 KY 108).
Written informed consent was obtained
from all the participants.
The inclusion criteria for patients in the
LCAS group were as follows: (I) active lung
cancer; (II) age > 18 years; (III) hospitalized
between January 2003 and December 2014;
and (IV) stroke occurred during treatment of
lung cancer, or diagnosed with lung cancer
during the treatment of stroke. The exclusion
criteria were: (I) presence of conventional risk
factors for stroke (such as hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, diabetes or hypercholesterol-
aemia; or (II) lung cancer diagnosed > 5
years ago, with no evidence of recurrence or
metastasis; (III) metastatic lesions in brain;
(IV) presence of other neurological diseases;
and (V) presence of any other malignant
condition, in addition to lung cancer.
The inclusion criteria for patients with
ischaemic stroke alone were: (I) presence of
risk factors for stroke; (II) hospitalized
between January 2003 and December 2014;
and (III) age-and sex-matched to patients
with LCAS. The exclusion criteria were: (I)
cerebral haemorrhage, (II) other neurological
diseases; (III) diagnosed with a malignant
disorder, and (IV) presence of organ failure.
The inclusion criteria for patients with
lung cancer alone were: (I) patients with
active lung cancer; (II) hospitalized between
January 2013 and December 2014; and (III)
age- and sex-matched to patients with
LCAS. The exclusion criteria were: (I) pres-
ence of brain metastasis; (II) absence of
active lung cancer; (III) presence of other
cancers; and (IV) organ failure.
Data collection and analysis
The medical records of the patients were
scanned for relevant information, including
demographic data, routine laboratory inves-
tigations, D-dimer levels, presence of cancer
markers such as CA125, CA153 and CA199,
presence of conventional risk factors for
stroke, relevant clinical data, imaging
reports (CT scan, MRI, transcranial
Doppler, magnetic resonance angiography,
computed tomography angiography, and
digital subtraction angiography). A modi-
fied Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to reduce
the potential impact of lung cancer on the
prognosis of stroke, while the Barthel Index
(BI) was used to assess the prognosis at 30
days post-stroke. Details of histological
type, metastasis and treatment were also
obtained in patients with lung cancer.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 16.0. Quantitative data were analysed
by analysis of variance or two independent
t-tests. Frequencies of normally distributed
variables were compared using 2 or Fisher's
exact tests. For variables exhibiting a non-
normal distribution (e.g., D-dimer, CA125,
CA155 and CA199 levels), inter-group
differences were evaluated using Mann ­
Whitney U tests. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was performed to iden-
tify independent risk factors. P < 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.
Results
Subject characteristics
A total of 102 patients with LCAS (mean
age 52.74 Æ 10.4 years), 102 patients with
lung cancer alone (mean age 52.0 Æ 11.0
years), and 102 patients with stroke alone
(mean age 51.2 Æ 9.7 years) were included in
the study. Each group included 84 men
(82.35%). The sex and age distributions
were comparable among the three groups.
Xie et al. 1485
Twenty-three patients (22.55%) in the
LCAS group were hospitalized as a result of
acute cerebral infarction. These patients
showed no other symptoms and the diagno-
sis of lung cancer was made incidentally
during the management of stroke in the
hospital. Fifty-eight patients (56.86%)
developed cerebral infarction within
4 months of the diagnosis of lung cancer,
11 (10.78%) between 5 and 12 months of
diagnosis, five (4.90%) from 1 ­ 2 years after
diagnosis, and five patients (4.90%) 24­30
months after their diagnosis of lung cancer
(Figure 1).
Clinical characterization of stroke
in patients with lung cancer
None of the patients with LCAS had any
obvious stroke risk factors, such as smoking,
hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidaemia.
There was no evidence of atrial fibrillation
on electrocardiography, and echocardiog-
raphy showed no signs of congenital heart
disease or valvular disease. Carotid ultra-
sound, magnetic resonance angiography and
whole-brain digital subtraction angiography
showed no stenotic lesion in the carotid or
vertebral basilar arteries. The clinical pres-
entation in these patients was similar to that
in patients with stroke alone, including
hemiplegia or single-limb paralysis, partial-
body sensory disturbances, slurring of
speech and other focal neurologic deficits.
However, some unique characteristics were
noted in these patients, including crypto-
genic cerebral infarction, multiple lesions
involving multiple cerebral artery territories
on MRI imaging, low mRS score, and high
mortality within 30 days of the occurrence of
cerebral infarction (Table 1 and Figure 2).
Clinical characterization of lung
cancer in patients with LCAS
The clinical presentation of patients with
LCAS included cough, haemoptysis, chest
pain, dyspnoea and laboured breathing,

similar to that of patients with lung cancer
alone. There were no differences in the
histological characteristics of the lung
cancer between the two groups. However,
LCAS patients had a higher frequency of
metastasis, and higher levels of D-dimer,
CA125 and CA199, suggesting a more
aggressive disease course (Table 2).
Risk factors for stroke in patients
with lung cancer
To identify the potential risk factors for
stroke in patients with lung cancer, we
analysed seven significant variables, includ-
ing platelets, D-dimer, CA125, CA155,
CA199, metastasis, and surgical therapy, by
multivariate logistic regression analysis. High
blood levels of D-dimer, CA155 and CA199
were independently associated with stroke
risk. We also examined the level-dependent
risks. The risk of cerebral infarction in
patients with lung cancer increased by 0.2%
(odds ratio [OR] 1.002; 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.000, 1.004; P ¼ 0.017) with an
increase in D-dimer level of 1 ng/ml. The risk
of cerebral infarction increased by 0.6% (OR
1.006; 95% CI 1.001, 1.010; P ¼ 0.017) with
an increase in CA125 of 1 U/mL, and by
2.1% (OR 1.021; 95% CI 1.011, 1.024;
P ¼ 0.000) with an increase in CA199 of 1
U/mL (Table 3). Spearman correlation ana-
lysis revealed positive associations between
D-dimer levels and CA125 (Rs ¼ 0.413,
P < 0.05) and CA199 levels (Rs¼ 0.527,
P < 0.05).

Discussion
Cerebral infarction is a potentially fatal
condition with a very short therapeutic
window,24,25 and identification of its aeti-
ology is critical to the successful manage-
ment of this disease.26 The short therapeutic
window means that the early detection of
cerebral infarction is of critical import-
ance,27 especially when it occurs in a patient
with a malignancy.28 This situation is not
rare, and several studies have clearly demon-
strated a higher incidence of stroke in cancer
patients compared with individuals without
cancer.29 The optimal management of these
patients is critical to their survival. Cancer-
associated stroke is thought to differ from
stroke occurring in the general population,
though the differences have not been well-
characterized. The current retrospective
study aimed to fill this knowledge gap,
based on data from a relatively large
sample of patients with LCAS.
Most patients in the present study suf-
fered from acute stroke within 4 months of
the diagnosis of lung cancer, consistent with
the findings of other studies. Bengt et al.
found that 1.6% of cancer patients devel-
oped stroke within 6 months of the diagnosis
of cancer,16 and the incidences of stroke in
cancer patients within 6­12 months and
within 1­5 years of cancer diagnosis were
1.1% and 1.2%, respectively.16 Chen et al.19
also reported a higher incidence of stroke in
cancer patients in the first 6 months after the
diagnosis of cancer. Collectively, these
results suggest that a diagnosis of cancer
should prompt consideration of stroke-pre-
vention therapy in addition to chemother-
apy, especially within 6 months of cancer
diagnosis.
Previous studies revealed that most
patients with cancer-associated stroke had
no other risk factors,20,30­35 and patients with
LCAS in the current study were defined as
having active lung cancer and acute stroke,
but without any other stroke risks factors.
In the present study, patients with LCAS
had elevated levels of plasma D-dimer and

multiple lesions involving multiple arterial
territories in the brain. Similar clinical fea-
tures have been found in patients with
cancer-associated stroke in several previous
studies.13­14,17 However, the present study
also found elevated plasma CA125 and
CA199 levels in LCAS patients, suggesting
that patients with cryptogenic stroke and
elevated plasma CA125 and CA199 levels
should undergo appropriate investigations
to rule out lung cancer. Further analysis
showed that elevated levels of plasma
D-dimer, plasma CA125 and CA199 were
all independent risk factors for stroke in
patients with active lung cancer.
The pathogenesis of stroke in cancer
patients has been a focus of attention.
Elevated D-dimer levels and multiple lesions
in multiple artery territories in patients with
cancer-associated stroke suggest that the
hypercoagulable state in cancer patients
may be an underlying reason for this
association. However, the mechanisms
responsible for the development of a hyper-
coagulable state in cancer patients remain
unclear. Previous studies investigating
this topic usually included patients with
multiple anatomic types of cancer, along
with stroke.
The present study showed that elevated
plasma levels of D-dimer, CD125 and
CA199 were independent risk factors for
stroke in patients with active lung cancer,
and that D-dimer levels were positively
associated with CA125 and CA199 levels.
We therefore concluded that elevated
plasma levels of CA125 and CA199 not
only act as biomarkers of lung cancer, but
may also play a role in increasing the
hypercoagulable state in lung cancer
patients. Significantly increased CA125
levels have also been reported to be related
to recurrent stroke.36 However, the mech-
anisms whereby elevated plasma levels of
CA125 and CA199 enhance the coagulation
state in lung cancer patients, leading to
stroke, need further investigation.
