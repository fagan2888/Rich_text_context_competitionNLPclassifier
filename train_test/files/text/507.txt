Abstract
Introduction: Multiunit housing (MUH) residents are susceptible to secondhand smoke (SHS), which can infiltrate smoke-free
living units from nearby units and shared areas where smoking is permitted. This study assessed the prevalence and characteris-
tics of MUH residency in the United States, and the extent of SHS infiltration in this environment at both the national and state
levels.
Methods: National and state estimates of MUH residency were obtained from the 2009American Community Survey.Assessed
MUH residency characteristics included sex, age, race/ethnicity, and poverty status. Estimates of smoke-free home rule preva-
lence were obtained from the 2006­2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The number of MUH
residents who have experienced SHS infiltration was determined by multiplying the estimated number of MUH residents with
smoke-free homes by the range of self-reported SHS infiltration (44%­46.2%) from peer-reviewed studies of MUH residents.
Results: One-quarter of U.S. residents (25.8%, 79.2 million) live in MUH (state range: 10.1% in West Virginia to 51.7% in New
York). Nationally, 47.6% of MUH residents are male, 53.3% are aged 25­64 years, 48.0% are non-Hispanic White, and 24.4%
live below the poverty level. Among MUH residents with smoke-free home rules (62.7 million), an estimated 27.6­28.9 million
have experienced SHS infiltration (state range: 26,000­27,000 in Wyoming to 4.6­4.9 million in California).
Conclusions: A considerable number of Americans reside in MUH and many of these individuals experience SHS infiltration
in their homes. Prohibiting smoking in MUH would help protect MUH residents from involuntary SHS exposure.
Introduction
Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) from burning tobacco
products causes disease and premature death among non-
smokers (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,
2006). Including the District of Columbia (DC), the number
of U.S. states with comprehensive smoke-free laws prohib-
iting tobacco smoking inside all worksites, restaurants, and
bars increased from 0 in 2000 to 26 in 2010 (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). However, as public
settings are increasingly made smoke-free, private settings
such as homes are becoming relatively larger contributors to
total SHS burden.
Multiunit housing (MUH) residents are particularly
susceptible to involuntary SHS exposure in the home.
Environmental studies conducted in MUH buildings indicate
that SHS constituents can infiltrate smoke-free units and
shared areas from units where smoking is permitted (Bohac,
Hewett, Hammond, & Grimsrud, 2011; King, Travers,
Cummings, Mahoney, & Hyland, 2010), and findings from
self-reported surveys suggest that 44%­53% of MUH
residents with smoke-free home rules have experienced
an SHS infiltration in their living unit that originated from
elsewhere in or around their building (Hennrikus, Pentel, &
Sandell, 2003; Hewett, Sandell, Anderson, & Niebuhr, 2007;
King, Cummings, Mahoney, & Hyland, 2010; Licht, King,
Travers, Rivard, & Hyland, 2012).
Although some studies have assessed the prevalence of SHS
infiltration among MUH residents (Hennrikus et al., 2003;
Hewett et al., 2007; King, Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht et al.,
2012), the characteristics of MUH residents and the number
who are potentially susceptible to SHS infiltration is uncertain.
This study calculated national and state estimates of the num-
ber of U.S. MUH residents, their sociodemographic character-
istics, and how many of these individuals have experienced an
SHS infiltration in their home.

Methods
Design and Sample
Estimates of MUH residency were determined by using
national and state representative data from the 2009 American
Community Survey (ACS), an annual household survey con-
ducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The sampling frame
includes all valid residential addresses in the 50 states and
DC. The ACS is primarily a mail-based survey; however, if
no response is received, follow-up is attempted via computer-
assisted telephone and in-person interviews. In 2009, 1,917,748
respondents were interviewed (one per household). The overall
response rate was 98.0%; state-specific response rates ranged
from 94.9% to 99.4% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012).
Estimates of smoke-free home rule prevalence were obtained
from the 2006­2007 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current
Population Survey (TUS-CPS), a cross-sectional household
survey of adults conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data
were collected from approximately 240,000 respondents
in May 2006, August 2006, and January 2007, with overall
response rates ranging from 80.0% to 85.0% across the three
data collection periods (National Cancer Institute, 2012).
Measures
For this analysis, a MUH resident was defined as any respond-
ent who reported living in a "one-family house attached to one
or more houses," or a building with between "2" and "50 or
more" apartments. Respondents were not considered MUH res-
idents if they reported living in a "one-family house detached
from any other house," "a mobile home," or "boat, RV, van,
etc." Sociodemographic characteristics included sex, age, race/
ethnicity, and poverty status. Poverty status was defined by
using 2009U.S. Census Bureau thresholds. Respondents were
classified as having a smoke-free home rule if they reported
that smoking was prohibited inside their home.
Analysis
For each state and the United States overall, the number of
MUH residents with smoke-free home rules was determined by
multiplying the prevalence of adults with self-reported smoke-
free home rules (TUS-CPS) by the respective number of MUH
residents (ACS).
The number of MUH residents who have experienced an
SHS infiltration in the home was determined by multiplying
the national and state-specific number of MUH residents with
smoke-free home rules by a range of 44%­46.2%. This range
was derived from all published peer-reviewed studies that have
assessed self-reported, past year SHS infiltration among MUH
residents with a smoke-free home rule, either during or after
the period (2006­2009) when the TUS-CPS and ACS data
were collected (King, Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht et al.,
2012). To ensure comparability with ACS estimates, studies of
specific MUH subpopulations (e.g., public housing) were not
considered in the infiltration range.
In both of the studies that were used to determine the pre-
scribed range, the extent of SHS infiltration was calculated among
MUH residents with a smoke-free home rule. However, differ-
ent questions were used to define SHS infiltration. In Licht et al.
(2012), which was fielded in 2010, respondents were considered
to have experienced SHS infiltration if they responded "most of
the time," "often," "sometimes," or "rarely" to the question, "In
the past 12 months, how often has tobacco smoke entered your
unit from somewhere else in or around your building?" In King,
Travers, et al. (2010), which was fielded between 2007 and 2009,
SHS infiltration was defined as a response of "daily," "a few times
a week," "once a week," "once every couple of weeks," or "once a
month or less" to the question, "During the last 12 months of liv-
ing in your unit, how often has SHS entered into your living space
from somewhere else in or around the building?"
Results
In 2009, 25.8% of U.S. residents (79.2 million) lived in MUH.
By state, the proportion of MUH residents ranged from 10.1%
in West Virginia (184,000) to 51.7% in New York (10.1 mil-
lion) (Table 1). The proportion of MUH residents in DC was
83.5% (501,000). Among all U.S. MUH residents, 22.1% lived
in one-family attached homes, 13.6% lived in apartment build-
ings with 2 units, 52.3% lived in apartment buildings with 3­49
units, and 12.0% lived in apartment buildings with 50 or more
units (data not shown).
By sex, 47.6% of U.S. MUH residents were male and
52.4% were female (Table 2). Most MUH residents were aged
25­64 years (53.3%), followed by those aged 18­24 (12.8%),
65 (11.2%), 4 (8.4%), 5­11 (8.3%), and 12­17 (6.1%) years.
By race/ethnicity, the greatest proportion of MUH residents
were non-Hispanic White (48.0%), followed by Hispanic
(23.0%), non-Hispanic Black (19.2%), non-Hispanic Asian
(6.8%), and other non-Hispanic races (3.0%). A total of 24.4%
of MUH residents lived below the federal poverty level.
An estimated 62.7 million U.S. MUH residents had smoke-
free home rules. Assuming a prevalence of SHS infiltration
between 44% and 46.2%, approximately 27.6­28.9 million
MUH residents with smoke-free home rules experienced
an SHS infiltration in their home within the past year. By
state, estimates of SHS infiltration ranged 26,000­27,000 in
Wyoming to 4.6­4.9 million in California (Table 1).
Discussion
Summary and Significance
The findings from this study reveal that over one-quarter of the
U.S. population (79.2 million individuals) resides in MUH and
that disparities in MUH residency exist across subpopulations.
The findings also show that an estimated 27.6­28.9 million
MUH residents with smoke-free home rules have potentially
experienced an SHS infiltration in their living unit that origi-
nated from elsewhere in or around their building. Separating
smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating
buildings cannot eliminate exposure of nonsmokers to SHS.
Therefore, policies prohibiting smoking in MUH, including
living units and indoor shared areas, represent the most effec-
tive way to fully protect MUH residents from involuntary
exposure to SHS in this environment.
Smoke-free MUH policies are favored by most MUH
residents (Hennrikus et al., 2003; Hewett et al., 2007; King,
Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht et al., 2012), are legally per-
missible in both government-subsidized and market-rate
housing (Schoenmarklin, 2009), and can result in cost savings

for MUH operators (Ong, Diamant, Zhou, Park, & Kaplan,
2012). Moreover, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) has encouraged public housing authori-
ties, as well as owners and management agents of multifamily
housing rental assistance programs, such as Section 8, to
adopt and implement smoke-free policies for some or all of
their properties (HUD, 2009, 2010). Nonetheless, few MUH
operators have implemented smoke-free policies, and many
have misconceptions about implementation barriers (Hewett
et al., 2007; King, Cummings, Mahoney, & Hyland, 2011).
Therefore, initiatives to reduce SHS in MUH should include
efforts to educate MUH operators about the benefits of smoke-
free policies.
Limitations
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report national
and state estimates of MUH residency and SHS infiltration
among U.S. MUH residents. Nonetheless, the findings are
subject to at least four limitations. First, MUH residency
and smoke-free home rule prevalence were determined from
data collected at different times. However, it is unlikely that
any significant changes in these estimates occurred during
the 2-year period between which the data were collected.
Second, smoke-free home rule estimates were obtained from
the general population and may not be generalizable to MUH
residents. However, estimates of smoke-free home rule preva-
lence among MUH residents are comparable to those of the
general population (King, Cummings, et al., 2010; Licht
et al., 2012; National Cancer Institute, 2012). Third, the SHS
infiltration range used in this study was based upon data col-
lected across multiple years (2007­2010). Since research sug-
gests that the prevalence of smoke-free MUH buildings has
increased with time (King et al., 2011), the inclusion of older
data could lead to overestimation of SHS infiltration. In order
to account for potential declines in SHS infiltration over time,
the present analysis included only national and state repre-
sentative studies conducted during or after the time period
in which the MUH residency (2009) and smoke-free home
(2006­2007) data were collected. Finally, the SHS infiltration
range was based upon two studies conducted nationally and
in one state (New York), which may limit generalizability to
other states and subpopulations. Accordingly, future research
could include state-level studies to verify and expand upon
the measures and findings presented in this study.
