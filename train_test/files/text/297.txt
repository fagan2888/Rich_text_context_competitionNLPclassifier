OBJECTIVE -- Low levels of androgens in men may play a role in the development of
diabetes; however, few studies have examined the association between androgen concentration
and diabetes in men in the general population. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis
that low normal levels of total, free, and bioavailable testosterone are associated with prevalent
diabetes in men.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study sample included 1,413 adult men
aged 20 years who participated in the morning session of the first phase of the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population of the U.S. Bioavailable and free testosterone levels were calculated from
serum total testosterone, sex hormone­binding globulin, and albumin concentrations.
RESULTS -- In multivariable models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and adiposity, men in
the first tertile (lowest) of free testosterone level were four times more likely to have prevalent
diabetes compared with men in the third tertile (odds ratio 4.12 [95% CI 1.25­13.55]). Simi-
larly, men in the first tertile of bioavailable testosterone also were approximately four times as
likely to have prevalent diabetes compared wth men in the third tertile (3.93 [1.39­11.13]).
These associations persisted even after excluding men with clinically abnormal testosterone
concentrations defined as total testosterone 3.25 ng/ml or free testosterone 0.07 ng/ml. No
clear association was observed for total testosterone after multivariable adjustment (P for trend
across tertiles  0.27).
CONCLUSIONS -- Low free and bioavailable testosterone concentrations in the normal
range were associated with diabetes, independent of adiposity. These data suggest that low
androgen levels may be a risk factor for diabetes in men.

It has been suggested that sex steroid
hormones may play a causal role in the
development of insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes (1,2). There is a growing
amount of literature examining the role
sex steroid hormones may play in the de-
velopment of diabetes and cardiovascular
disease in women, but there has been rel-
atively less attention paid to this associa-
tion in men. Men with endocrine
disorders that are associated with low tes-
tosterone levels (hypogonadism), such as
Klinefelter's and Wolfram's syndromes,
have an elevated risk of developing insu-
lin resistance and diabetes (3,4). How-
ever, the association between sex steroid
concentrations within the normal range
and diabetes risk in men in the general pop-
ulation has not been well characterized.
Obesity, one of the most important
underlying causes of insulin resistance, is
associated with low testosterone levels in
men (5­7) and may partially or wholly
mediate the process by which endoge-
nous sex hormones influence diabetes
risk. Many previous studies have been
conducted in small, highly selected pop-
ulations or convenience samples and/or
did not rigorously measure or control for
the possible effects of adiposity. The
present study was undertaken to investi-
gate the association between sex steroid
hormones and diabetes in the general
adult male population in the U.S. Specif-
ically, we hypothesized that low levels of
total, free, and bioavailable testosterone
would be associated with prevalent diabe-
tes. We also hypothesized that this asso-
ciation would persist after controlling for
the potentially confounding effects of ad-
iposity. Estimates from this study are na-
tionally representative of the U.S. adult
male population in 1988­1991.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Between 1988 and
1994, the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics conducted the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). NHANES III was designed
as a cross-sectional study using a multi-
stage-stratified, clustered probability
sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitution-
alized population. To ensure adequate

sample sizes of specific subgroups of the
U.S. population, Mexican Americans,
non-Hispanic blacks, and the elderly
were oversampled. Subjects participated
in an interview that was conducted at
home, as well as an extensive physical ex-
amination. This examination was per-
formed at a mobile examination center
and included collection of a blood
sample.
NHANES III was conducted in two
phases (1988­1991 and 1991­1994).
Unbiased national estimates of health and
nutrition characteristics can be indepen-
dently produced for each phase. Within
each phase, subjects were randomly as-
signed to participate in either the morning
or afternoon/evening examination ses-
sion. In total, 33,944 subjects were inter-
viewed in NHANES III, of which 30,818
had had a physical examination at the
medical examination center. Of 14,781
male subjects with an examination, 9,282
were at least 12 years old, of whom 2,205
participated in the morning session of
phase I. Morning sample participants
were chosen for this hormone study to
reduce extraneous variation due to diur-
nal production of sex hormones. Serum
was still available in the main NHANES III
repository for 1,637 of these men: 716
non-Hispanic white, 411 non-Hispanic
black, 448 Mexican-American, and 62
other race/ethnicity subjects. The men of
other racial/ethnic groups were excluded
from the statistical analysis because of
small sample size. The present study pop-
ulation was limited to men aged 20
years (n  1,413).
Height, weight, and waist and hip cir-
cumferences were measured as part of the
NHANES examination. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters. Partici-
pants were defined as having diabetes if
they answered "yes" to the question,
"Have you ever been told by a doctor or
other health professional you had diabe-
tes or sugar diabetes?" Information on age
and race/ethnicity were self-reported. De-
tailed information regarding the collec-
tion of data in NHANES III is available
elsewhere (8).
Sex steroid hormones
The main hormones of interest in this
study were measured total testosterone
(serum), estimated bioavailable testoster-
one, and estimated free testosterone. Tes-
tosterone is the major male androgen, and
its free circulating levels are primarily de-
termined by sex hormone­ binding
globulin (SHBG). Free (unbound) testos-
terone accounts for a relatively small
circulating concentration of total testos-
terone (2­3%). Bioavailable testosterone
is the concentration of non­SHBG-bound
testosterone and is comprised of both free
and albumin-bound (20­40%) testoster-
one levels. Total testosterone is the com-
bination of circulating bioavailable levels
and SHBG-bound levels (considered bio-
logically inactive). Measurements of free
and bioavailable testosterone levels more
accurately represent concentrations
readily available to tissues and metabolic
processes.
Serum testosterone, estradiol, andro-
stanediol glucuronide (AAG), and SHBG
concentrations were measured as part of
the larger Hormone Demonstration
Project, and all are included in the present
study for comprehensiveness. Estradiol is
the major estrogen in men; AAG is an in-
dicator of the conversion of testosterone
to dihydrotestosterone, the major intra-
prostatic androgen; and, as mentioned
above, SHBG is the major carrier of tes-
tosterone and estradiol in circulation.
Blood was drawn after an overnight
fast for participants in the morning sam-
ple during either an examination at the
medical examination center or during an
abbreviated examination at home. After
centrifugation, the serum was aliquotted
and stored at 70°C until spring 2005.
Levels of sex steroid hormones and SHBG
are stable after multiple freeze-thaw cy-
cles (9,10). Serum concentrations of tes-
tosterone, estradiol, AAG, and SHBG
were measured in the laboratory of N.R. at
Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachu-
setts. We used competitive electrochemi-
luminescence immunoassays on the 2010
Elecsys autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN) to quantify serum tes-
tosterone, estradiol, and SHBG concen-
trations. AAG was measured by an
enzyme immunoassay (Diagnostic Sys-
tems Laboratories, Webster, TX). The
participant samples were randomly or-
dered for testing, and the laboratory tech-
nicians were blinded to participant
characteristics. The lowest detection lim-
its of the assays were 0.02 ng/ml testoster-
one, 5 pg/ml estradiol, 0.33 ng/ml AAG,
and 3 nmol/l SHBG. For quality control
specimens included during the analyses
of NHANES III specimens, the coefficient
of variation percentages were as follows:
testosterone 5.9 and 5.8% at 2.5 and 5.5
ng/ml, estradiol 6.5 and 6.7% at 102.7
and 474.1 pg/ml, AAG 9.5 and 5.0% at
2.9 and 10.1 ng/ml, and SHBG 5.3 and
5.9% at 5.3 and 16.6 nmol/l. Bioavailable
and free testosterone levels were calcu-
lated from serum total testosterone,
SHBG, and albumin concentrations (11).
The protocols for conduct of
NHANES III were approved by the insti-
tutional review board of the National
Center for Health Statistics, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. In-
formed consent was obtained from all
participants. The assay of stored serum
specimens for the Hormone Demonstra-
tion Project was approved by institutional
review boards at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health and the
National Center for Health Statistics, Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed us-
ing SUDAAN, as implemented in SAS v.
8.1 (Cary, NC) software. In each analysis,
we applied sampling weights to take into
account the specific probabilities of selec-
tion for the individual domains that were
oversampled, nonresponse, and differ-
ences between the sample and the total
U.S. population. Because the serum con-
centrations were not normally distrib-
uted, we compared geometric means by

diabetes status. Molar ratios of tes-
tosterone to SHBG, estradiol to
SHBG, and estradiol to testosterone
were calculated and analyzed in the
same way.
In logistic regression models of
prevalent diabetes, the highest
(third) tertile of each hormone was
used as the reference group and we
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI,
and waist-to-hip ratio, as these fac-
tors may both influence hormone
concentrations and the distributions
of which vary by diabetes status. In
additional logistic regression mod-
els, we also examined the association
of total testosterone, estradiol, and
SHBG with diabetes after simulta-
neously adjusting for the other two
hormones and the risk factors listed
above. Simultaneous adjustment for
testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG al-
lowed us to observe whether an as-
sociation was present with one
hormone while holding constant the
concentrations of the other two.
RESULTS --Table 1 shows se-
lected (crude) characteristics of this
study population of men aged 20
years by diabetes status. Men with
diabetes were substantially older,
more likely to be non-Hispanic black
or Mexican American, and had higher
BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, highlight-
ing the importance of adjustment for
these factors in subsequent analyses.
Table 2 displays the crude and
age- and race/ethnicity-adjusted geo-
metric means of each hormone and
molar ratios by diabetes status. Total
testosterone and estimated bioavail-
able testosterone concentrations
were lower in men with diabetes
compared with men without diabe-
tes. Estradiol levels were similar in
men with and without diabetes.
SHBG levels appeared higher in men
with diabetes but not after age and
race/ethnicity adjustment. Crude esti-
mated free testosterone was lower in
men with diabetes, but this did not
persist following adjustment.
The results from our adjusted lo-
gistic regression models are dis-
played in Tables 2 and 3. Total
testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, and
AAG were not significantly associ-
ated with diabetes status after multi-
variable adjustment (Table 3).
However, as shown in Table 4, there
was some evidence of an association
between total testosterone and diabetes
after further adjustment for estradiol and
SHBG (odds ratio [OR] 1.99 [95% CI
0.76­5.19]; P value for trend  0.014).
Estimated free testosterone and bioavail-
able testosterone were highly inversely as-
sociated with diabetes status, even after
multivariable adjustment (Table 3). Men
in the lowest tertile of free testosterone
level were four times more likely to have
prevalent diabetes compared with men in
the third tertile (4.12 [1.25­13.55]; P
value for trend  0.04). Similarly, men in
the first tertile of bioavailable testosterone
were also approximately four times as
likely to have prevalent diabetes com-
pared with men in the third tertile (3.93
[1.39­11.13]; P value for trend  0.01).
These associations persisted even after
further adjustment for total cholesterol,
triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure
(analyses not shown).
We also conducted sensitivity analy-
ses including cases of undiagnosed diabe-
tes (diabetes defined on the basis of a
fasting glucose alone; n  58) and exclud-
ing men with low total testosterone
(3.25 ng/ml; n  211) or low free tes-
tosterone (0.07 ng/ml; n  339). The
results for estimated free testosterone and
total testosterone were essentially un-
changed after excluding men with clini-
cally low levels: OR 3.23 (95% CI 1.18­
8.86) for free testosterone and 1.03
(0.41­2.58) for total testosterone com-
paring men in the first tertile with the
third. The results for all models also were
not altered appreciably by the inclusion of
undiagnosed diabetes in our case defini-
tion (analyses not shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- The indepen-
dent association of low free and bioavail-
able testosterone levels in our adjusted
models suggest that testosterone insuffi-
ciency may be a risk factor for diabetes.
Associations of low free and bioavailable
testosterone levels with diabetes re-
mained even after adjustment for age and
known confounding factors including
race/ethnicity and adiposity, as measured
by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. The asso-
ciation with low free testosterone per-
sisted even after the exclusion of men
with clinically low total and/or free testos-
terone levels, suggesting that this associa-
tion was not entirely driven by
hypogonadal men.
While the directionality of the associ-
ations between low androgen levels and
adiposity remain unclear, our data are
consistent with the hypothesis that an-

Androgens and diabetes in men
236 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 30, NUMBER 2, FEBRUARY 2007
drogens may directly influence glucose
metabolism and the development of insu-
lin resistance independently of the effects
of adiposity. Nonetheless, our results are
not as strong in magnitude as those re-
ported in some previous studies (12),
likely because we examined these associ-
ations in the general male population with
"normal" range androgens. We did not
observe a clear association of total testos-
terone concentration with diabetes. Con-
trary to previous studies (13­15), we did
not observe significantly lower levels of
SHBG in diabetic compared with nondia-
betic men before or after adjustment.
The cross-sectional design is an im-
portant limitation of this study. We can-
not determine the temporality of the
associations observed here between an-
drogen levels and diabetes. However, sev-
eral previous prospective analyses
(13,14,16,17) suggest that decreases in
testosterone level may precede the devel-
opment of diabetes, lending support to a
temporal if not causal relation. Addition-
ally, including individuals with undiag-
nosed diabetes, a population at an earlier
point in the progression of diabetes, did
not change our results. This is one of the
largest epidemiologic studies of andro-
gens and diabetes in men in the published
literature (12); nonetheless, we were un-
able to explore possible effect modifica-
tion and subgroup analyses due to power
limitations resulting from the relatively
small number of diabetic cases (n  101)
in this general population.
To our knowledge, this is the first
study to examine the association between
sex steroid hormones and diabetes in a
large, nationally representative male pop-
ulation. Strengths of the present study
were the large sample and corresponding
power to detect small differences, even
after adjustment for relevant covariates
including measures of adiposity. Further-
more, we have shown here relationships
of each major sex steroid hormone with
diabetes including differences by molar
ratios and multivariable models, which
included simultaneous adjustment for to-
tal testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG.
This study also benefited from the rigor-
ous and standardized measurement of de-
mographic characteristics, laboratory
analyses, and anthropometric measures
in the NHANES III Study.
In men, serum levels of testosterone
and bioavailable testosterone decline with
age (18); however, the clinical conse-
quences of this decline are largely unchar-
acterized. The literature investigating the
association between androgen levels in
men and the development of cardiovascu-
lar disease has been equivocal (19), with
some evidence of a possible protective ef-
fect of higher testosterone levels (13,20­
23). Diabetes is a known risk factor for the
development of atherosclerosis and car-
diovascular disease. Further studies are
need to understand if the elevated risk of
cardiovascular disease in hypogonadal
men and in men with "low normal" an-
drogen levels seen in some studies might
be wholly or partially mediated by the de-
velopment of diabetes. Additional epide-
miologic and etiologic studies are needed
to clarify the mechanisms by which sex
steroid hormones may directly contribute
to diabetes and other chronic diseases.
