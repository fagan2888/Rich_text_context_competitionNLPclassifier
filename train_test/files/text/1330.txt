Abstract
ZHANG, QI AND YOUFA WANG. Trends in the
association between obesity and socioeconomic status in
U.S. adults: 1971 to 2000. Obes Res. 2004;12:1622­1632.
Objective: To study the secular trends in the disparity of
obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups among
U.S. adults.
Research Methods and Procedures: We used national rep-
resentative data collected in the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Surveys conducted in 1971 to 1974, 1976
to 1980, 1988 to 1994, and 1999 to 2000 from 28,543 adults
20 to 60 years old. Obesity was defined based on BMI
calculated using measured weight and height. Trends in the
relationship between obesity and education levels were an-
alyzed controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity.
Results: The disparity in obesity across SES (less than high
school, high school, and college or above to indicate low,
medium, and high SES, respectively) has decreased over the
past 3 decades. In National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Surveys I (1971 to 1974), there was as much as a 50%
relative difference in the obesity prevalence across the three
groups, but by 1999 to 2000, it decreased to 14%. This trend
was more pronounced in women. The trends of diminishing
disparities in obesity were also revealed by our logistic and
linear regression analyses. The odds ratio converged to 1
from the 1970s to 2000. In most sociodemographic groups,
the relationship between BMI and SES (coefficients) has
been weakened over time.
Discussion: The association between SES and obesity has
been weakened over the past 3 decades, when the preva-
lence of obesity increased dramatically. There are consid-
erable variations in the changes in the associations across
gender and ethnic groups. Our findings suggest that indi-
vidual characteristics are not likely the main cause of the
current obesity epidemic in the U.S., whereas social-envi-
ronmental factors play an important role. Strategies for
obesity prevention and management should target all SES
groups from a societal perspective.

Introduction
National survey data show that the prevalence of obesity
has doubled over the past 3 decades, and it continues to
increase in the United States (1­3). Currently, approxi-
mately two-thirds of American adults are overweight or
obese (3). Obesity increases the risks of a number of dis-
eases and health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer
(4,5). A recent study suggests that an estimated 300,000
deaths in the U.S. are related to the condition (6). The total
direct and indirect costs associated with obesity have been
estimated at $117 billion in 2000 (7).
Socioeconomic status (SES)1 has, in the past, been an
important factor associated with obesity, particularly in
women, because SES influences individuals' energy intake
and energy expenditure and, as a result, affects their body
fat storage (8). Previous studies have shown that the asso-
ciation between SES and obesity may vary by populations,
by gender, and by age (8­10). In general, in industrialized
countries, low-SES groups are more likely to be obese than
their high-SES counterparts, whereas in developing coun-

tries, high-SES groups are more likely to be obese (11­13).
Numerous studies conducted in the U.S. have shown that
low-SES and minority groups have a higher prevalence of
obesity (14­16). However, to our knowledge, few studies
have systematically examined whether the relationship be-
tween obesity and SES has changed over time; in other
words, whether the disparity in obesity across SES groups
has changed. If the relationship has changed, are there
differences across sociodemographic (e.g., gender and eth-
nic) groups? The present study attempts to answer these
questions.
Research on the secular trend in the disparity of obesity
across different SES groups is of special importance for
several reasons. First, it can help increase our understanding
of the underlying causes of the rising obesity epidemic in
the U.S. Second, it can help predict future trends in obesity
prevalence across SES groups. Finally, such research find-
ings can guide the development of effective programs and
policies for the prevention and management of obesity in
different SES groups. It can help set priorities for future
research and interventions, and for government policy to
reduce obesity. In the present study, using successive na-
tional representative survey data that were collected over
the past 4 decades in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined the secular
changes in the relationship between obesity and SES in the
U.S. We also examined whether the changes in the associ-
ations varied across gender and ethnic groups.
Research Methods and Procedures
Data
The NHANES include a series of cross-sectional surveys
that have provided nationally representative information on
the nutrition and health status of the U.S. civilian popula-
tion. The National Center for Health Statistics conducted
the first and second NHANES (I and II) in 1971 to 1975 and
1976 to 1980, respectively; NHANES III was conducted
during 1988 to 1994. Since 1999, NHANES has been a
continuous survey, and the data are now available for the
first 2 years of that period (1999 to 2000). All of the four
rounds of NHANES used a stratified, multistage probability
cluster sampling design. Detailed descriptions of the sample
design, interviewing procedures, and physical examinations
conducted have been published elsewhere (17­20).
In each survey, standardized protocols were used for all
interviews and examinations. Data on weight and height
were collected for each individual through direct physical
examination in a mobile examination center. In NHANES I
and II, race-ethnic group was classified as white, black, and
"other" based on observation. In NHANES III, subjects
were classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, and other ethnic groups, based on self-
reported race and ethnicity. In NHANES 1999 to 2000,
subjects were classified into non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, Mexican American, other race (including mul-
tiracial), and other Hispanic.
Measures
Definitions of Overweight and Obesity. BMI [weight
(kilograms)/height (meters squared)] was calculated for
each individual based on measured weight and height. Ac-
cording to the World Health Organization's recommenda-
tion, individuals with a BMI 30 were considered obese
(5). Pregnant women were excluded from our analysis.
SES. Most commonly used variables to measure SES
were education, income, and occupational status. Each SES
measure had its own strengths and limitations when the
relationship between SES and health outcomes was studied.
Many researchers suggested that education is the most sta-
ble and robust indicator of SES (21­23).
We selected education level of the subjects as the primary
measure of SES because: education is the only available
SES variable in NHANES 1999 to 2000; education is less
likely to be affected by a subject's body weight status,
whereas people's income might be affected; and education
is more comparable across time than income or occupation.
In addition, education had little missing data, compared
with income. We coded the education level as follows: low
education (less than high school, meaning ninth grade or
less), medium education (high school, meaning 10th to 12th
grades), and high education (college or higher) to indicate
low, medium, and high SES. Note that our findings regard-
ing the trends in the association between SES and obesity
were similar if income was used as the indicator of SES in
analysis using the NHANES I to III data (data not shown).
Confounding Variables. Previous studies suggest that
obesity is associated with demographic characteristics such
as gender, age, and race/ethnicity (24,25). Meanwhile, SES
may also be correlated with gender, age, and ethnicity.
Thus, these variables are potential confounders, and it is
necessary to control for them when studying the relationship
between SES and obesity. When studying the difference
across ethnic groups, because of small sample sizes and
limited information about subjects with Hispanic origin
available in NHANES I and II, we recoded race/ethnicity
into three groups (white, black, and other) to make the
analysis comparable across surveys. In this report, we fo-
cused on the comparison between white and black.
Because there were two gender groups, three ethnic
groups, and three SES levels, 18 gender-race-education
groups were created in our analysis. If we would have
stratified the subjects further into four age groups, the
sample size for each gender-race-age-SES group would
have been too small. Therefore, we reported prevalence

only in gender-ethnic-SES groups. However, we did control
for age in our regression analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Our analysis of the NHANES I, II, and III data was
conducted using Stata (version 7; Stata Press, College Sta-
tion, TX). Analysis of the 1999 to 2000 data was conducted
using SUDAAN. All analyses took into account the com-
plex survey design and unequal probabilities of sample
selection in NHANES. First, we examined the absolute and
relative differences in the prevalence of overweight and
obesity among the low-, medium-, and high-SES groups in
different gender-ethnic groups over time. Next, we con-
ducted logistic regression to examine the association be-
tween obesity and SES (two dummy variables to code low
and high SES were used; the medium-SES group was used
as the reference) and overweight and SES. Odds ratios
(ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-
mated. The results for overweight were similar to those for
obesity; thus, they were not presented. Finally, using mul-
tiple linear regression analysis, we examined the relation-
ship between BMI and SES. All regression analyses were
conducted separately for men and women, and age was
controlled. Race/ethnicity was also controlled when analy-
sis was conducted for combined ethnic groups in men and
women. Statistical tests were conducted at the p  0.05
significance level.
Results
Social Demographic Characteristics and Anthropometric
Measures
The social-demographic characteristics and anthropomet-
ric measures of adults across NHANES are presented in
Table 1. During the period of 1971 to 2000, the population
became slightly older; mean age increased 3.4 years. There
was also a remarkable change in the population composi-
tion: The proportion of white people continued to decrease,
and the proportion of "other race" adults, including His-
panic, increased significantly after NHANES II. Proportions
of individuals in different education categories also changed
across surveys. More people had a high educational level
(college or higher), and fewer people had a medium educa-
tional level (high school). In NHANES I and II, 50% of
the individuals were in the medium educational level, but by
the time of the NHANES III and again in 1999 to 2000,
50% were in the higher education level. With more mi-
nority individuals moving into the high-education group,
the association between SES and obesity in the whole
population was likely to be weakened because minority
groups tended to have a higher prevalence of obesity than
whites. Neither men's nor women's height changed over the
period, but their weight increased considerably: Men's
mean weight increased by 7.5 kg (or, in relative terms,
9.5%), whereas women's mean weight increased by 10.6 kg

Secular Trends in the Disparity of Obesity across SES
Groups: The Absolute and Relative Differences in the
Prevalence across SES Groups
To examine the secular trends in the disparity of obesity
across SES groups, we calculated the absolute and relative
difference in prevalence among the three SES groups in
each survey period for each sex-ethnic group (Tables 2 and
3). Similar to what other researchers have reported previ-
ously, our analysis showed that the prevalence of obesity
increased significantly over the last 4 decades in all gender-
ethnic-SES groups. Among the three SES groups, the high-
education group had the highest rate of increase in the
prevalence of obesity. For example, the prevalence of obe-
sity in black men with high education increased by a strik-
ing 6 times between NHANES I and NHANES 1999 to
2000, whereas the prevalence of obesity in black men with
medium education increased only 40% during the same
period. In white women, the prevalence of obesity in the
high-education group quadrupled, whereas the rate in the
low-education group had only a 66% increase. The same
pattern can be found also in white men and black women.
Prevalence of obesity in low-educated black women was
quite stable across time, but the rate among the more highly
educated almost tripled.
Clearly, the difference in the prevalence between the low-
and high-SES groups became smaller over time, more dra-
matically so among women than men. For example, among
women, the absolute difference in obesity prevalence be-
tween the low- and high-SES groups dropped from 18 to 8
percentage points, or, in relative terms, 71% to 21%.
Among men, it dropped from 5 to 3 percentage points, or,
in relative terms, from 38% to 12%.
We also observed remarkable ethnic differences in the
trends. In white women, the absolute difference in preva-
lence of obesity between those with low education and those
with medium education was reduced 44%, whereas the
relative difference was reduced 62%, between NHANES I
and NHANES 1999 to 2000. In NHANES 1999 to 2000, no
significant difference existed among SES groups, except for
the difference between the low- and high-SES groups in
white women. In black women, the magnitude of the rela-
tive and absolute differences in the prevalence declined
compared with the three previous waves of NHANES, but
the direction of the association was changed. In NHANES I
to III, African-American women with lower SES had a
higher prevalence of obesity, but in 1999 to 2000, the
medium-SES group had the highest prevalence.
The trends in disparity among men were mixed. In white
men, the absolute difference between the prevalence of
obesity in two SES groups was stable across surveys,
whereas the relative difference decreased. In black men, the
disparity in obesity between the medium- and the high-SES
groups tended to decline across time, whereas the disparity
between the low-to-medium and the low-to-high SES
groups had no clear pattern.
Secular Trends in the Association between Obesity and
SES
Our logistic regression analysis indicated that the associ-
ation between SES and obesity was attenuated over time,
especially among women. ORs tended to converge to 1
across surveys in most gender-race groups (see Figure 1 and
Table 4, in which medium SES was the reference group). In
white women, ORs for obesity in those with low education
decreased from 1.40 to 1.15 between NHANES I and 1999
to 2000, whereas ORs for obesity in those with high edu-
cation increased from 0.45 to 0.78 during the same period.
It is worth noting the reducing statistical significance of
ORs across time, especially in women. For example, in
white women, ORs for obesity in high- or low-education
groups were all statistically significantly different from 1 in
NHANES I and II but became insignificant in NHANES III
and 1999 to 2000.
There were remarkable differences between men and
women and across ethnic groups. In black women, the OR
for the low-SES group was reducing to 1 across surveys.
However, no clear reducing trend was observed for the
high-SES group. In men, the reference group had a higher
risk of obesity than the other two SES groups. There was a
rising trend for ORs in low- and high-education groups
across surveys. In white men, the OR in those with low
education increased from 0.66 to 0.91, whereas the OR in
those with high education rose from 0.53 to 0.78. In
NHANES I and II, the ORs in white men with high educa-
tion were significantly less than 1. But in NHANES III and
1999 to 2000, the ORs in the same group became not
significantly different from 1. A similar pattern was ob-
served in black men, but with less statistical power.
Secular Trends in the Relationship between BMI and
SES
In general, the findings of our multiple linear regressions
(Table 5) were consistent with those of the logistic regres-
sion analysis. We observed mixed patterns in the association
for men but a clearly weakened one for women. For women,
the overall association between SES and BMI changed from
significant in the 1970s (a reverse association) to insignif-
icant in 1999 to 2000. In NHANES I, compared with
medium-SES women, low-SES women's BMI was 1.5
points higher (p  0.05), whereas that of the high-SES
group was 1.2 points lower (p  0.05). The figures were

OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 12 No. 10 October 2004 1625
similar in NHANES II, whereas by 1999 to 2000, none of
the differences was significant. In fact, the change had
already started in NHANES III for the low-SES group when
the difference between the low- and medium-SES groups
became insignificant (p  0.05). The patterns were similar
for white and black women.

slightly increased protective effect in the high-SES group
compared with the medium-SES group over time. High-
SES had a protective effect in white men but not in black
men. In white men, the  coefficient changed from 0.34 in

icantly higher BMI (  2.53, p  0.05) than the medium-
SES group.
In addition, we examined the trends regarding how
much of the variation in BMI could be explained by SES
by calculating partial R2 due to SES (change in R2) when
including and excluding low- and high-SES in the models
(Figure 2). In women, a clear declining trend was ob-
served, which indicates that SES had become a less
powerful predictor of BMI. In men, the partial R2 de-
creased in the first three waves of NHANES, but picked
up in 1999 to 2000, in particular, due to the increase in
black men's partial R2.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has system-
atically examined the trends in the association between SES
and obesity among U.S. adults between the 1970s and 2000
using national representative data with measured anthropo-
metric measures. Overall, our findings show a dispropor-
tionate increase in the prevalence of obesity in the high-SES
group and a weakened association between SES and obesity
in most gender and ethnic groups. There are considerable
variations in the changes in the associations across gender
and ethnic groups. The trend is clearer for women than for
men. These findings provide a new perspective to under-
stand the causes of the dramatic increase in obesity in the
U.S. Although a positive energy balance (i.e., energy in-
take  energy expenditure) over a prolonged period must be
the fundamental biological basis for the development of
obesity, it is crucial to understand how individual factors
and social-environmental factors may lead to an energy
imbalance. SES is an important individual characteristic
that influences an individual's access to resources, knowl-
edge of nutrition and health, food choices, and physical
activity at work and in leisure time (26). Extensive literature
has documented the higher rates of obesity and overweight
among low-SES groups (3,4,9), but we have noticed a
significant "catch-up" in the prevalence of obesity in the
high-SES group.
The timing of the changes in the relationship between
SES and obesity coincided with the increase in the preva-
lence of obesity. Before NHANES III, the relationship
between SES and obesity was relatively stable, which was
consistent with findings from previous studies (27,28).
However, distinct changes in the relationship between SES
and obesity were observed between NHANES II and III.
During this period, the prevalence of obesity increased
dramatically.
The declining disparity of obesity across SES groups and
a weakened relationship between SES and BMI indicate that
individual characteristics may not be the dominant factor
that has contributed to the dramatic increase in obesity over
the past 2 decades. The trends we observed suggest that
some social-environmental factors might have a more pro-
found effect in influencing an individual's body weight
status than an individual's characteristics such as SES. We
suspect that some societal environmental changes affecting
all SES groups have contributed to a gradual positive energy
balance and weight gain among American adults; thus, the
association between obesity and an individual's SES is
weakened. However, different gender and ethnic groups
may have different susceptibilities and may have adopted

different behaviors to face these changes, which helps ex-
plain the differences in the trends we observed among
different population groups.
Environmental changes/factors could increase people's
energy intake and decrease people's energy expenditure.
First, with regard to energy intake, the revolution in the
mass preparation of food could be a key factor that leads to
significant increase in food consumption in the United
States (29). The average time of food consumption has been
lowered so that people have more food options and can eat
more frequently. Because "people who have had the most
ability to take advantage of the technical changes should
have had the biggest gains in weight," women could be most
significantly affected by the revolution in food preparation.
This may help explain why the disparity of obesity across
SES was more weakened in women than in men because the
revolution reduces the differences between rich and poor
women in food preparation and consumption.
Second, it is argued that the U.S. government's agricul-
ture policy, which subsidizes farmers to produce grains and
meats and provide them to the domestic market at low
prices, has contributed to people's excessive intake of food
and to the current obesity epidemic (30). Another factor that
recently has drawn much attention because it affects almost
everyone is the increase in portion sizes of food served in
restaurants and of processed food packages. For example,
the portion sizes of fast foods such as French fries and
burgers and sugar-sweetened soft drinks all have increased
dramatically. Take soda as an example: Coca-Cola moved
from the svelte 8-ounce bottle of soda in the 1970s to the
20-ounce bottle of today. Because the prices of raw mate-
rials are so low, many food industry companies are able to
provide larger portion sizes without increasing the price per
unit of food; in fact, this helps them increase their profit
(30). However, the increase in portion sizes has promoted
overconsumption of energy (31,32). Moreover, ubiquitous
advertisements for energy-dense foods, low prices of un-
healthy foods, large portion sizes, and food preparation
practices at home can affect all SES groups and, thus,
promote weight gain (33).
The other side of the energy equation is energy expendi-
ture. Over the past 2 to 3 decades, many social, economic,

and environmental changes probably have contributed to the
decline of people's physical activity and energy expenditure
(34). Technological development and the expansion of
global trade have facilitated more sedentary lifestyles in all
SES groups in the U.S. (35). One good example that dem-
onstrates the many impacts of new technologies on people's
daily lives is the development of personal computers and the
booming of the information technology industry. The infor-
mation technology advances influence people's occupations
and their daily activities by fostering more sedentary activ-
ities and reducing job- and leisure-related energy expendi-
ture. Meanwhile, the transfer of labor-intensive industries to
developing countries no doubt has reduced the number of
workers who are employed in these high-energy-expending

sectors of employment in the U.S. In addition, compared
with the past, Americans more often drive to work than
walk or take public transportation, and there are more ele-
vators in working sites, residential apartments, shopping
malls, and other public buildings. Finally, people are less
likely to engage in outdoor activities due to concerns about
crime or due to the lack of sidewalks and recreation facil-
ities in the communities, and they spend more time on
sedentary activities such as watching TV and playing video
games.
All of these changes may be playing a more dominant
role in influencing people's weight status than individual-
level characteristics such as SES (although broad social-
environmental factors related to obesity still need to work
through an individual's behaviors). Thus, the association
between SES and obesity has been diminishing in an "obe-
sogenic" environment.
Our findings suggest that population-based and environ-
mental approaches should be developed for the prevention
and management of obesity, whereas individually based
approaches, as suggested by many previous studies, proba-
bly will not be very effective. Not only low-SES groups but
also higher SES groups should be targeted in these efforts
(36). Despite previous calls for action and large amounts of
resources spent by individuals to reduce weight (37), the
prevalence of obesity and overweight has increased in all
SES groups. The disproportionate increase in the prevalence
of obesity and overweight in high-SES groups indicates that
even if people are aware of the importance of maintaining a
healthy body weight, having a healthy diet, and engaging in
regular physical activity, they are still gaining weight. It is
societal changes that have contributed to the increase in
obesity. Without developing effective strategies to modify
the current obesogenic environment in the U.S., it is likely
that the obesity epidemic will continue, which implies that
there will be a greater burden of obesity-associated chronic
disease such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes to
contend with in the future.
