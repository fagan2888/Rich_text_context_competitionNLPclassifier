Background
The success of medical treatment is influenced by the quality
of health services and patient adherence to their treatment
plan (Hsu et
al., 2014). Therapeutic treatments will not
achieve optimum effects without patient awareness, because
without it, therapy can fail or complications may eventually
lead to fatal events (Hussar, 1995).
A number of studies have shown that patient adherence
during chronic treatment such as diabetes mellitus (DM),
asthma, cardiovascular diseases, high cholesterol, breast
cancer, and glaucoma is commonly low. The discontinuation
rates of the medication on the 30 days of treatment reached
42% and non oral treatment of DM had the high risk of dis-
continuation (Vanelli et
al., 2009; Zullig et
al., 2015).
Research involving outpatients shows that more than 70% of
patients do not adhere to correct administration and appro-
priate medicine dosage (Basuki, 2009). According to the
World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2003, average
of patient adherence in long-term therapy for chronic dis-
eases in developed countries is only 50%, while in develop-
ing countries, it is even lower (Asti, 2006). The prevalence of
nonadherence in diabetic patients is high, due to the duration
of treatment, and may lead to an increase in mortality, mor-
bidity, and other adverse effects (Blackburn, Swidrovich, &
Lemstra, 2013; Delamater, 2006). The other previous study
showed that nonadherence in oral antidiabetic treatment was
associated with the incidence of end-stage renal disease, and
the effect was more significant in the polytherapy of oral
antidiabetic treatment and under the metformin polytherapy,
besides other risk factors (Chang, Chien, Lin, Chiou, & Chiu,
2015).
Adherence to treatment involves patient psychology, such
as knowledge and motivation. Adherence is also influenced
by the quality of interaction between patient and health pro-
vider (Delamater, 2006; Sarafino, 1998; Taylor, 2006). There
are some annoying patient behaviors, such as expression of
criticism and anger, ignoring doctor's advice, asking for

Treatment Adherence and Quality of Life
in Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Indonesia
D. A. Perwitasari1 and S. Urbayatun2
Abstract
Adherence to treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) can support successful therapy due to drug consumption over longtime
periods. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the treatment adherence in DM as related to the quality of life and to
evaluate factors associated with adherence and quality of life. This study used the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) to
measure patients' adherence. The Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire (DQLCTQ) was used to measure
patients' quality of life. Subjects of this cross-sectional study were DM patients attending two private hospitals in Yogyakarta
and who had been taking DM medications for more than 6 months. Statistical analyses used in this study were student's
t test and regression linear test. We recruited 65 DM patients who met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant
differences of BMQ screens and DQLCTQ functions between monotherapy and combination therapy groups (p> .05). The
BMQ screens' score of combination therapy were higher than monotherapy groups. The physical function, health distress,
and mental health of combination therapy groups were higher than monotherapy group. The male patients had significantly
higher score of regimen domain of BMQ than female patients (0.35 and 0.17, respectively). The older age has the lower score
of treatment effect of DQLCTQ (p< .05). The belief, recall, and belief about adverse drug reaction of BMQ have positive
correlation with physical function (r = .542, .424, and .640, respectively). Our study concluded that the quality of care, sex,
and age may predict patients' adherence and quality of life. There were positive correlation between patients' adherence and
quality of life.

laboratory tests, asking for medications that according to the
doctor are not needed, and other things that reflect nonadher-
ence. Under such conditions, the quality of medical services
will negatively affect, so it is necessary to encourage condi-
tions that improve individual motivation toward the adoption
of long-term treatment, including their quality of life
(Sarafino, 1998). A previous study about health-related qual-
ity of life (HRQoL) of type 2 DM patients in Bangladesh
showed that some patients' characteristics like age, gender,
income, education, family history, duration of DM, and treat-
ment prescribed could affect patients' quality of life (Saleh,
Mumu, Ara, Hafez, & Ali, 2014). Other previous study in
Malaysia reported that the use of insulin could give negative
impact to the patients' quality of life. Patients treated with
insulin, who also supported by strict lifestyle management,
got desired glycemic control. However, that management
could cause the deterioration in quality of life (Daher etal.,
2015).
One method for understanding patient adherence is the
use of the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). The ques-
tionnaire illustrates the patient's assumptions toward medi-
cation, including necessity, awareness, illustration of painful
effects, and excessive drug use (Menckeberg etal., 2008). A
previous study conducted on type 2 DM patients in Iran con-
cluded that low BMQ scores were related to low patient
adherence, which resulted in experiences of adverse drug
reaction by patients (Delamater, 2006).
The Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire
(DQLCTQ) is one of the DM quality of life questionnaires
developed by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes
Study (UKPDS) group. This instrument has been piloted in
San Francisco, California, and Lyon, for type 1 and type 2
DM patients. The items measured in the DQLCTQ include 8
domains: physical function, energy/fatigue, health distress,
mental health, satisfaction, treatment satisfaction, treatment
flexibility, and frequency of symptoms. Total scores vary
between 0 (poor quality of life) and 100 (highest quality of
life). The higher scores indicate a better health status (Shen
etal., 1999). To date, there have been no studies in Indonesia
with the objective of exploring patient adherence and quality
of life in DM patients or to analyze predictors using the
BMQ and DQLCTQ questionnaires. The objectives of this
research are to evaluate the treatment adherence in DM as
related to the quality of life and to evaluate factors associated
with adherence and quality of life.
Method
Participants
This study used a cross-sectional design and the data were col-
lected prospectively. We conducted this study at two private
hospitals in Yogyakarta. The subjects of this research were all
type 2 DM outpatients who had used a minimum of 6 months
monotherapy or combination therapy since diagnosis. Inclusion
criteria were type 2 DM patients, at least 6 months after initial
diagnosis, who voluntarily became involved in the research,
and were literate. Exclusion criteria were type 2 DM patients
who were suffering chronic disease complications, patients
with psychiatric diseases and who did not volunteer to enroll in
this research. We excluded these patients by finding the diagno-
ses in their medical records. By excluding the complications of
the patients, we also excluded the patients with comedications.
Patients who used monotherapy DM treatment had only one
kind of DM medication, whether oral or injection. Patient who
used combination DM therapy used a combination of more
than two types of DM medication as well as oral­oral, oral­
injection, or injection­injection (combination of short acting
insulin and medium acting insulin).
We conducted and compared our study in two private hos-
pitals which are under the similar organization in Yogyakarta.
The differences between the hospitals are the location, the
capacity, and the status of hospital. The Hospital A is located
in the city, higher capacity and having status as education
hospital. However, the Hospital B is located in urban area,
lower capacity and the education hospital status is still sub-
mitted to the government. Thus, the differences between the
hospitals could be according to the typical of the patients
which came around the city and the urban area. Both of the
hospitals are the referral hospitals from the primary health
care, and the government health insurance has been applied
in the two hospitals. There are no differences between the
treatment guideline, due to the universal health coverage
applied in the hospitals.
Patients at both hospitals were asked to join the research
voluntarily and to give their informed consent. To aid quality
control during data collection, the researcher accompanied
the patients while they completed the questionnaires. This
research was approved by the Research Ethic Committee of
University of Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.
Questionnaires
We used the Indonesian version of the BMQ and an already
validated Indonesian version of the DQLCTQ. The two
questionnaires were used in this study due to the availability
of DQLCTQ in Bahasa Indonesia and the short version of
BMQ. Adherence to treatment was measured by the BMQ
with the screen of dose regimen, recall, access, and belief.
The regimen screen has 0 to 5 scale; however, the recall,
access, and beliefs screens have 0 to 2 scale. There are also
three questions about fear or worry about drug side effect
which has 0 to 3 scale. The higher scale of screens is the bet-
ter compliance and positive concern about recall, access, and
beliefs, and less fear about side effect. This questionnaire has
0 to 1 scale which shows the higher score is the better adher-
ence (Svarstad etal., 1999). This study was preceded by a
forward­backward translation from the original version of
BMQ to obtain an Indonesian BMQ version and was fol-
lowed by pilot testing and a validity and reliability test for
Perwitasari and Urbayatun 3
DM patients. Validation and reliability tests using the
Indonesian version of the BMQ were conducted on 20 DM
patients. Forward and backward translation of the BMQ was
carried out before this study. Two Indonesian translators who
were experts in the English language performed the forward
translation process. Discussions were carried out to compare
the questionnaires and agree on one version in Bahasa
Indonesia. The Indonesia version was backward translated
by a native speaker who was fluent and understood Bahasa
Indonesia.To corroborate the translation result, an Indonesian
who was an expert in the English language performed a
backward translation. The comparison of the two results
from the backward translation and the original version of the
questionnaire were performed, and one version in Bahasa
Indonesia was obtained with the same content as the original
version.
The results of a pilot test on the first draft of the Indonesian
BMQ version were related to the layout of the questionnaire.
The respondent suggested a clearer layout for the question-
naire to make it easier to answer. Pilot testing also showed
that there were no significant differences in the domains of
beliefs and adherence among healthy respondents and sick
respondents (p> .05). However, a significant difference was
seen in the dosage regimen domain among healthy and sick
respondents (data not shown). This result can be explained
because healthy respondents did not take drugs, so there
could be no problem with their dosage regimen.
We used the Cronbach's alpha coefficient which was
more than .7 to meet the criteria of validity. Furthermore, the
construct validity to measure the convergent and discrimi-
nant validity of Indonesian version of BMQ was performed
(Pérez-Escamilla, Franco-Trigo, Moullin, Martínez-
Martínez, & García-Corpas, 2015).
Patient quality of life was measured with the DQLCTQ
with the domains of physical function, energy, health dis-
tress, mental health, satisfaction, treatment satisfaction,
treatment effect, and frequency of symptoms. This question-
naire has 0 to 100 scale which shows the higher score is the
better quality of life. The Indonesian version of DQLCTQ
has been validated in the previously study (Hartati & Asdie,
2003).
Statistical Analysis
Cronbach's alpha coefficient was defined to understand the
reliability of Indonesian version of BMQ. Pearson-correlation
test was performed to understand the construct validity of
Indonesian version of BMQ. The item of questionnaires met
the convergent validity if significantly related to its domain
and met the discriminant validity if the relation between item
and its domains was higher than its relation with other
domains (Perwitasari etal., 2011).
The differences between the BMQ and DQLCTQ scores,
between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups,
and between the two hospitals were tested using the student's
t test (for parametric tests) or the Mann­Whitney test (non-
parametric tests). Regression linear tests were used to under-
stand the predictors of adherence and quality of life.
Results
An earlier step in our study was the translation and validation
of the Indonesian version of the BMQ. The Indonesian
DQLCTQ was available as a validated version.
Table 1 presents the Cronbach's alpha value (>.70), which
shows that all BMQ domains met the criteria for reliability.
The results of the validation test can be seen in Table 2. All
questions and domains of the Indonesian BMQ version met
discriminant and convergent validity with significant results
(p< .01), except for Question Number 7c on the regimen
domain and the Question Number 2 of recall domain. That
was because there was only one answer from the respondent,
so it was not possible to have variation.
Table 3 presents patient characteristics; most of the
patients were female (52.3%), mean average was 57.69 ±
11.41, and they were prescribed combination therapy for DM
treatment (66.2%). The score of BMQ screen was good,
which mean that the patients adhere to the regimen of the
treatment (4.45 ± 0.95), the patients had a good recall of their
medication (1.92 ± 0.97), the refill of medication was afford-
able (1.93 ± 0.30), the belief about the effectiveness of their
medication was good (1.71 ± 0.55), and there was less fear or
worry about the side effect (2.55 ± 1.53).
The results of the BMQ and quality of life analysis regard-
ing the type of patient treatment (monotherapy and combina-
tion therapy) are shown in Tables 4 and 5. There were no
significant differences of BMQ screens between the types of
treatment. Moreover, there were no quality of life differences
between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups.
We analyzed the scores differences of BMQ domains and
quality of life domains between two hospitals. The dosage
regimen shows significant differences between the two hos-
pitals, which is patients of Hospital B had a higher mean
score for dosage regimen than those of Hospital A (4.18 ±
1.20 and 4.74 ± 0.51, respectively; p< .01). Furthermore,
there was significant difference between the two hospitals in
the treatment effect domain (p< .01). Patients of Hospital B
had a higher mean treatment effect than those of patients at
Hospital A. Generally, the quality of life domains score was
more than 70, which showed that the quality of life at both

hospitals was quite high, except for the treatment effect
domain at Hospital A (59.24 ± 12.9 and 75.00 ± 20.7, respec-
tively) and the patients' satisfaction domain in both hospitals
(data were not shown).
Regarding the demographic factors in this study, we found
that only the BMQ regimen domain was significantly differ-
ent between sexes. The mean score of the regimen domain of
male patients was higher than for female patients (0.35 and
0.17, respectively; p = .03). However, only the treatment
effect domain of the DQLCTQ showed a significant differ-
ence between sexes with the score of male patients being
higher than for female patients (71.96 and 62.47, respec-
tively; p< .01). However, patient age significantly affected
the DQLCTQ treatment effect domain (r = .28, p< .02, data
were nor shown).
According to the correlation between BMQ domain and
quality of life domain, we find that beliefs, recall, and beliefs
about adverse event screens of BMQ had positive correlation
with physical function (r = .542, .424, .640, respectively; p<
.05, data were not shown).
Discussion
In general, we found positive correlation between adherence
to medication and quality of life. Patient demographic fac-
tors like age and sex affect patient's adherence and quality of
life. There are no significant differences of BMQ screens and
DQLCTQ functions scores between monotherapy and com-
bination therapy. On the contrary, there are some significant
differences of BMQ screens and DQLCTQ functions scores
between the two hospitals. Our findings were supported by
previous study which stated patient's access to drugs which
was definitely determined by the distance between the
patient's house and the hospital, the duration of disease,
complexity of treatment, polytherapy, psychological factors,
safety, and tolerability became potential reasons for patients'
nonadherence. It means that adherence will decline with an
increase in drug numbers (García-Pérez, Álvarez, Dilla, Gil-
Guillén, & Orozco-Beltrán, 2013).
According to high scores of BMQ screens and moderate
scores of DQLCTQ, it can be a challenge for health care pro-
viders, especially pharmacists, nurses, doctors, and psychol-
ogists, to motivate patients to carry out their therapy properly.
Of course, this is not an easy thing, because collaboration
from various health personnel is needed to help patients to
adapt to their disease and treatment. Previous studies have
stated that DM health care teams should collaborate to sup-
port patients to cope with the disease and treatment, and thus
to improve their adherence (Delamater, 2006). Another pre-
vious French study shows that most diabetic patients have
medium adherence which is affected by demographic fac-
tors, health provider-related factors, and disease treatment-
related factors (Miv et
al., 2012). Some factors may be
modifiable, meaning that the health care provider can give
individualized patient recommendations. However, some
demographic factors like older age and complexity of disease
and treatment could not be modified.
According to the DM treatment type, the score of all
screen in BMQ for combination therapy is higher than for the
monotherapy group. A previous study also shows that
decreased adherence was related to polytherapy (Claxton,
Cramer, & Pierce, 2001). This factor can be modified by
changing the medication into a simple regimen which can be
managed by patients. There was also no difference in quality
of life between the monotherapy group and combination
therapy. The previous study used the EuroQol five dimen-
sionsquestionnaire (EQ-5D), which only consisted of five
questions; this certainly helped the patients to fill in the ques-
tionnaire with ease. This study shows that patients with low
adherence have a low quality of life (Saleh etal., 2014). In
contrast, the current research showed that, on average, a
patient's quality of life was quite good (score >75) except on
some domains such as satisfaction and treatment effect. This
difference could be caused by sample number, variation due

to the instrument that was used, and differences in hospital
service quality. Other previous studies regarding factors
related to the quality of life of diabetic patients stated that
DM had a negative impact on patients'quality of life and that
comorbidity may further decrease patients' quality of life
(Wändell, 2005).
Patients' quality of life at both hospitals was only signifi-
cantly different with regard to the domain of treatment effect.
This treatment effect can be categorized into therapeutic
effects and adverse effects. Adverse effects of treatment may
appear when the drug is taken for a long time period or may
be due to the interaction with other drugs taken for other
pathologic conditions. Previous studies showed that nonad-
herence of DM patients was significantly related to medica-
tion-adverse effect (Chao, Nau, & Aikens, 2012; Rwegerera,
2014; Wabe, Angamo & Hussein, 2011). DM patients who
experience complications may be given more than three
types of drug, which could result in drug interaction and
adverse effects (Curkendall, Thomas, Bell, Juneau, & Weiss,
2011; Nau, 2012). From the interview with patients, we
understand that such issues will of course affect patient
quality of life as patients may avoid taking DM medication,
and therefore, therapeutic effects will decrease. However, if
a patient decided to continue on taking DM medication
despite the unpleasant side effects, the patient may suffer
during treatment. In general, the quality of life for DM
patients at both hospitals was quite high, with scores >75,
except for some domains such as satisfaction and treatment
effect. Most of the type 2 DM patients experienced hypogly-
cemia (around 57%; Nau, 2012), which could have affected
adherence (Chao etal., 2012; Nam, Chesla, Stotts, Kroon &
Janson, 2011). Because of the long duration of treatment,
other adverse effects such as constipation, headaches, and
water retention may also result in nonadherence in diabetic
patients (García-Pérez etal., 2013). Poor adherence can have
clinical impacts such as a decrease in glycemic control, com-
plication of the disease, mortality, and hospitalization
(American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2013; Blackburn
etal., 2013; Ho etal., 2006). In this study, we did not take the
data of adverse effect experienced by the patients. However,
we can see patients' perceptions about adverse effect in the
beliefs domain of BMQ. We can see the hypoglycemia effect
from the domain of treatment effect and frequency of symp-
toms of DQLCTQ, because DQLCTQ adopted the hypogly-
cemic fear survey in its domain (Shen et
al., 1999). The

beliefs domain in Hospital B was higher than the beliefs
domain in Hospital A, meaning that patients in Hospital A
did not understand about the treatment and the treatment's
effect. However, there were three questions about the fear of
patients toward adverse effect. The patients in both of the
hospitals had less fear or worry about drug adverse event.
This finding was also supported by higher score of treatment
effect of DQLCTQ, whereas the higher score of Hospital B
reflected that patients in Hospital B had better treatment
effect than Hospital A. According to the patients' adherence,
we can see that patients in Hospital A had lower score of
adherence than Hospital B, and it could be due to the higher
adverse effect fear experienced by patients of Hospital A.
According to the hospital's service, even though Hospital
A is located in the city and has higher status level, the
Hospital B could provide better health service and could be
acceptable to the patients. Thus, Hospital B supported
patients' attempts to adhere to their medical treatment and
cope with the disease in their life. The integrated health ser-
vice in the Hospital B from the physician, nurse, pharmacist,
and dietician could support patients' adherence. A previous
study showed that demographic, psychological, social sup-
port; health care providers; medical systems; disease; and
treatment-related factors can promote diabetic patients'
adherence. Social support given by nurses in DM health care
teams may improve glycemic control, lipid levels, and blood
pressure levels (Delamater, 2006). The multidisciplinary
approach to the diabetes management and the nature of clini-
cal setting can influence patients' adherence and quality of
life (Nau, 2012). The results of the previous study are in line
with our study, which showed that the sex and age of patients
may influence patients' adherence and quality of life.
Our study also found that the physical domain of
DQLCTQ was affected by BMQ domain such as belief,
recall, and beliefs about Adverse Drug Event (ADE). It
means that patients'belief about the effectivity of their medi-
cation, and about the ADE and patients' adherence in taking
the medication, can predict patients' quality of life. These
results are in line with previous study in which medication
adherence had positive correlation with DM patients quality
of life (Chew, 2015). However, previous studies about the
correlation of DM patients' adherence and HRQoL in
Pakistan showed that the patient' HRQoL decreased associ-
ated with the poor adherence (Nazir, Hassali, Saleem, Bashir,
& Aljadhey, 2015).
To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to
address adherence to treatment in DM patients using the
Indonesian version of the BMQ. This questionnaire is suit-
able for DM patients as it meets minimum requirements for
test reliability and validity. Systematic review about valida-
tion of questionnaires to measure patients' adherence in
hypertensive patients showed the results of internal validity
of BMQ which were on the range 0.60 to 0.73. However,
there were no construct validity reported of BMQ in the sys-
tematic review (Pérez-Escamilla et
al., 2015). Our study
presents the good value of Cronbach's  and acceptable val-
ues of convergent and discriminant validities.
The limitation of our study was the small sample size and
we only recruited outpatients of DM. We also cannot gener-
alize our findings to all DM patients due to the exclusion
criteria in our study which could not find in the medical
records. We have conducted the interview training to all
researchers involved in this study; however, we cannot stan-
dardize the information which should be deeper explored to
the patients. For further research, we propose intervention
from pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, and physicians as a
health care team to work together to improve patients'adher-
ence to treatment in outpatient and inpatients situation.
Conclusion
Our study concluded that the quality of care, sex, and age
may predict patients' adherence and quality of life.
Furthermore, there are positive correlation between patients'
adherence and quality of life.
