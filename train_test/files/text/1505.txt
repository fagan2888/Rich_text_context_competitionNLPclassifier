Socioeconomic Differentials in Immune Response
Jennifer Beam Dowd,a,b and Allison E. Aielloc,d
Background: Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly linked to
health outcomes, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Little
is known about the role of the immune system in creating and sustaining
health disparities. Here we test whether SES is related to cell-mediated
immunity, as measured by the host's ability to keep persistent cyto-
megalovirus (CMV) antibody levels in a quiescent state.
Methods: Censored regression models were used to test the cross-
sectional relationship of education, income, and race/ethnicity with
antibody response to CMV, using a nationally representative sample of
9721 respondents aged 25 years and older in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994).
Results: Among CMV-seropositive respondents, those with less
education, lower income, and nonwhite race/ethnicity had higher
levels of CMV antibodies at all ages. On average, each additional
year of age was associated with CMV antibody levels that were 0.03
units higher (95% confidence interval  0.03 to 0.04), whereas each
additional year of education was associated with antibody levels that
were 0.05 units lower (0.02 to 0.09). A doubling of family income
was associated with antibody levels that were 0.25 units lower (0.11
to 0.39), the equivalent of 8 fewer years of age-related CMV
antibody response. These relationships remained strong after con-
trolling for baseline health conditions, smoking status, and BMI.
Conclusions: SES is associated with an indirect marker of cell-
mediated immunity in a nationally representative sample. SES
differences in immune control over CMV may have fundamental
implications for health disparities over the life course.

Health disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) in the US
are well established for a wide range of health outcomes.1
The US Department of Health and Human Services declared as
1 of the 2 major goals of the Healthy People 2010 initiative "to
eliminate health disparities among different segments of the
population." The pathophysiologic mechanisms linking lower
SES to the earlier onset of disease are not well understood. In
particular, very little is known about the role of the immune
system in creating and sustaining health disparities.
Recent studies have shown that cytomegalovirus
(CMV) may be a factor in immunosenescence.2­4 Indeed,
CMV has been considered a more important predictor of
mortality than many of the well-known traditional immune
function markers such as CD4:CD8 ratio, T-cell proliferation,
and B cell counts in older age populations.5 CMV has also
been implicated in cardiovascular disease and more recently
linked to cognitive and physical decline.6­10 Primary infec-
tion with CMV can occur at a very young age, and is often
asymptomatic. The virus remains persistent in the infected
host's cells for life. Containment of the virus becomes an
immune system priority.11,12 Studies have identified positive
age-related gradients in antibody response to CMV that are
accompanied by higher shedding of CMV DNA.12 Because
impaired cellular immune response can result in increased
CMV viral replication, these studies suggest that an increase
in CMV antibody titer is a good marker of compromised cell
mediated immunity observed in aging.12,13
Previously, data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III have described
large disparities in CMV prevalence in the US by education,
income, and race and ethnicity over a range of ages.14,15
These SES disparities in seroprevalence emerge as early as
age 6 years, converging over age 65 years when more than
90% of the population is exposed. Socioeconomic disparities
in CMV seroprevalence provide important information about
the link between socioeconomic determinants and exposure
to CMV, but do not provide any indication of the variability
in immune response to CMV among those who are seropos-
itive. The social patterning of immune response among sero-
positive individuals has not been fully explored. Recent work
identified an association between lower education and in-
creased immune response to CMV and Herpes Simplex Virus
Type 1 (HSV-1) in a community-based sample of Latinos
ages 65 years and over.16 It is unclear whether similar
gradients are found across a broader range of categories of
age, race, and ethnicity. If socioeconomic gradients in CMV
antibody levels are sustained across the life course, it may
well represent an important immunologic pathway linking
socioeconomic status to adult immune function and overall

health. Therefore, we analyzed NHANES III data for subjects
aged 25 years and older to assess social patterning in immune
response to CMV.
METHODS
Study Population
Participants were part of the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES) III conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics from 1988 to 1994. The
sample was a complex, stratified, multistage probability clus-
ter of the US population including interview, clinical exam-
ination, and laboratory tests. Persons less than 5 or over 60
years of age, non-Hispanic black persons, and Mexican
Americans were sampled at a higher frequency than other
groups to obtain adequate sample sizes for subgroup analysis.
The complete methodology and response rates of NHANES
III have been published previously.17 To focus on adult
socioeconomic status and antibody response to existing in-
fection, our analysis includes individuals 25 years and older
who are seropositive to CMV (n  10,882). Those classified
as CMV-seropositive represent 81% of respondents aged 25
years and older. As reported elsewhere, correlates of CMV
seropositivity in the US include lower education and income,
older age, and non-Hispanic black and Mexican American
ethnicity.14,15 Of the 10,882 subjects, 1161 CMV seropositive
individuals (12%) were lacking data on one or more covari-
ates, primarily income, leaving a final sample of 9721 sub-
jects. Individuals with missing income were slightly more
likely to be women with less education, but did not differ in
CMV antibody levels.
Measures
Cytomegalovirus antibody levels were tested using fro-
zen stored sera specimens from NHANES III to estimate the
seroprevalence of CMV infection (CMV IgG) in participants
aged 6 years and above and released in 2006. CMV-specific
IgG was measured by an Enzyme Linked Immunoassay
(ELISA) (Quest International, Inc., Miami, FL). IgG optical
density and ELISA index values were subsequently released
in 2007 to the investigators by special request to the National
Center for Health Statistics. As the original aim of the CMV
testing was to identify seropositivity rather than continuous
antibody levels, 32% of the IgG values for the full sample
(and 48% of the values for the sample 25 years and over)
were given a top-coded value of the maximum detectable
threshold, which was set for each test batch. ELISA Index
values between 0.90 and 1.05 (1% of the sample) were
considered indeterminate with regard to seropositivity by the
laboratory (Quest International, Inc.). We conservatively
classified these individuals as seronegative to ensure that our
analysis focused on antibody response among seropositive
individuals and did not reflect underlying differences in
seropositivity.
Education was measured as the respondent's years of
completed education. A linear specification of years of education
provided the best model fit. Family income was self-reported
pretax family income for the 12-months prior to the survey
including wages, salaries, income from self-employment, veter-
an's benefits, interest dividends, rental income, and public as-
sistance. Income data were recorded in 28 income categories
(none; less than $1000; $1000­$20,000 in $1000 increments;
$20,000­$50,000 in $5000 increments; and greater than
$50,000). We coded family income as the midpoint of each of
the reported categories (using $65,000 for the incomes above
$50,000) and adjusted for inflation between the 2 NHANES III
phases, using the Consumer Price Index. Income was log-
transformed due to the skewness of the distribution. Race/
ethnicity was grouped in 4 categories (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other).
A modified Charlson index was used to control for the
potential impact of current chronic health conditions on
immune response. The Charlson index employs a weighting
system for each condition category based on the adjusted risk
of 1-year mortality.18 A higher score reflects a more severe
burden of comorbidity. Weights were assigned for having myo-
cardial infarction, cerebrovascular/peripheral vascular disease,
chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue/autoimmune dis-
ease, ulcer, liver disease, diabetes, moderate to severe renal
disease, and any tumor. Points for each condition were summed
to create the final score, as previously described.18
To assess the potential effects of any immune-related
conditions or current infections not captured in our Charlson
index, we created 2 medication variables to represent whether
an individual was taking, near the time of the blood sample,
any of the major classes of drugs that are: (i) treatments for
concurrent infection (ie, antibiotics, cold medicines, antivi-
rals, antiretrovirals, etc.) or (ii) treatments for autoimmune
disorders (ie, corticosteroids, immunologic agents, immuno-
modulators, antiarthritics). Other control variables included:
sex; age in years; marital status (1  married or cohabitating;
2  widowed, separated, or divorced; 3  never married);
census region of residence; urban or rural residence; house-
hold size (persons in the dwelling); an indicator for current,
former, or never smoking status; and body mass index (BMI).
Statistical Analysis
The association of education and income, with CMV
antibodies was tested using censored normal regressions to
account for the right-censoring of CMV values. This model is a
generalization of the Tobit model that allows censored values to
vary from observation to observation, rather than a constant
upper or lower censoring point.19 In our case, because different
CMV testing batches were arbitrarily top-coded at different
values, this model was the most appropriate. All observations
were assigned the CMV value reported, and an additional
indicator variable was created: 0, if the observation was not
right-censored and 1, if the observation was right-censored. All

analyses were conducted using STATA 10.0 (STATA, College
Station, TX) survey commands to account for the complex
survey design, and the sample completing the laboratory com-
ponents was weighted to reflect the noninstitutionalized popu-
lation of the United States. The command "cnreg" was used in
STATA for the right-censored models.
Statistically significant interactions between income
and sex and between education and sex were identified,
leading to subsequent stratification by sex. Other covariates
included in preliminary models included age, race-ethnicity,
Charlson index, census region of residence, urban or rural
residence, marital status, prescription medication use, smok-
ing status, or obesity. Of these, only age, race/ethnicity, and
the Charlson index were associated with CMV antibody
levels in fully adjusted models. The final model thus re-
gresses CMV antibody levels on education, income, age,
race/ethnicity, and the Charlson index, stratified by sex.
RESULTS
Sample descriptives for the 9797 participants are shown
in Table 1. There was a higher mean CMV antibody level
among women compared with men, and lower levels of
former and current smoking among women than among men.
There were only slight differences in other variables by sex.
CMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:
Full Sample
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the adjusted relationship of
categorical education and income with CMV values across
age, based on predicted values. CMV antibody levels in-
creased substantially with age. Within a given age group,
levels were higher for those with less education and less
income. Increasing age was associated with higher CMV
antibody levels at the rate of 0.03 ELISA units per year after
age 25, consistent with a decreased ability of the immune
system to maintain control over the virus with age (Table 2).
Both education and family income were inversely as-
sociated with CMV antibody levels. Each additional year of
education was associated with a 0.05 reduction in the CMV
ELISA index value. Thus, holding all else constant, an
additional 5 years of education was associated with roughly
the same reduction in CMV values as would be seen in a
respondent 8 years younger. Non-Hispanic blacks, on aver-

age, had higher CMV levels compared with non-Hispanic
whites, and women had higher levels on average than men,
holding all else constant. In fully adjusted models, having
more chronic conditions as measured by the Charlson Index
was also associated with higher CMV levels.
CMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:
by Sex
The associations of education and income with CMV
varied by sex (Table 2). For women, years of education were
more strongly associated with CMV levels than for men, for
whom the association with income was stronger. For women,
each additional year of education was associated with a 0.08
reduction in the CMV index, so that an additional 5 years of
education was associated with a reduction in CMV values
similar to that seen in women approximately 13 years
younger, holding all else constant. For men, the association
with income appeared to dominate that of education, such
that a doubling of family income was associated with a 0.44
lower index value of CMV, all else held constant. For men,
this 0.44 reduction in the index value is equivalent to the
reduction associated with being 11 years younger.
The effects of race/ethnicity appeared stronger for
women than for men. In fully adjusted models, non-Hispanic
black women had a CMV index value that was 0.78 points
higher than non-Hispanic white women, and Mexican-Amer-
ican women had an index 0.91 points higher than non-
Hispanic white women, though the standard error was much
larger for Mexican-Americans. The magnitude of these dif-
ferences is large compared with the 0.03 unit increase with 1
year of age. For men, non-Hispanic blacks had CMV values
0.31 units higher than to non-Hispanic whites, holding all else
constant. In fully adjusted models, the Charlson Index was
associated with higher levels of CMV for the full sample,
slightly less so for women than for men. Adjusting for current
conditions and comorbidities did not account for the relation-
ship of SES and race/ethnicity, with CMV antibody response.
CMV Antibody Levels, Education, and Income:
by Age
It is possible that SES differences in antibody response
would emerge only in older age groups at greater risk of
immune decline. To test this hypothesis we interacted both
education and income with continuous age, and also with
dichotomous age (above and below age 65 years). None of
these interactions was statistically significant, providing no
support for the possibility that the associations of education
and income with CMV antibody response depend on age.
DISCUSSION
We find a substantial association between socioeconomic
status and an indirect marker of cell-mediated immunity in a
nationally representative sample of the US population. Our study
confirms recent findings of an association between level of
education and CMV antibody response in a community-based
study of elderly Latinos.16 The findings suggest that impaired
cell-mediated immunity may be one way that SES is related to
health outcomes in the US population.
CMV has been called the "driving force" behind age-
associated alterations to the T-cell immune system. The cost
of constant CMV immunologic vigilance throughout life may
be high.11 This theory is based on evidence that aging
populations experience increased CMV-specific CD8 T-cell
proliferation, reducing the availability of CD8 T-cell carry-
ing receptors that are specific for other pathogens or foreign
antigens that the immune system may encounter. This large
clonal expansion of CMV-specific CD8 T cells found in
aging populations limits the capacity of the immune system to
mount an efficient immune response.20 The reduction in the
number of naive cells able to combat new antigens21 resulting
from CMV-specific clonal expansion can directly hinder
immune response in medically important ways, as observed
in poorer immune responses to influenza vaccination among
those with higher CMV IgG antibody levels.22 These effects
may be particularly relevant for older adults, for whom poor

vaccine response is related to higher rates of clinical illness
such as influenza infection and pneumonia.23
Recent work has shown that persistent CMV infection
in the elderly is an important component of a set of immu-
nologic parameters designated the "immunologic risk pheno-
type."21 This set of immunologic markers, including persis-
tent CMV, high CD8 cells, low CD4 cell percentages, and
poor T-cell proliferation, are predictive of mortality among
healthy elderly individuals.2,11 In addition to these associa-
tions, high levels of CMV IgG antibody are strongly corre-
lated in older people with increases in serum cytokines such
as tumor necrosis factor (TNF­) and interleukin (IL)-6.22
This inflammatory pathway may explain the observed links
between CMV and cardiovascular disease, frailty, cognitive
outcomes, and Alzheimer disease.6­10 Unfortunately, cyto-
kines were not assayed in NHANES III, and so we are unable
to test their potential relationship to CMV antibody levels in
our sample. Testing of C-reactive protein (CRP) data in
NHANES III preceded high-sensitivity assay techniques, re-
sulting in 60% of the CRP values in our sample falling below
the detectable threshold, limiting its usefulness in our analy-
ses. It is possible that immune response to latent infection
may explain some of the socioeconomic gradients in cardio-
vascular disease and other inflammatory-associated condi-
tions that have thus far remained unexplained.
Given the evidence for the role of CMV in diseases of
aging, the strong patterning of CMV antibody levels by
income, education, and race/ethnicity in NHANES III may be
a substantively important pathophysiologic mechanism link-
ing SES to health outcomes. Differences in CMV antibody
levels were not accounted for by existing chronic conditions,
or by health behaviors such as smoking and obesity that
might influence immune function. The observed differences
were also not explained by factors associated with CMV
seropositivity, such as the number of persons in the house-
hold or region of residence.14
Although it is clear that CMV antibody levels are
higher in lower SES respondents, firm conclusions about the
causes of these differences cannot be drawn from the current
data. Several studies have used herpesviruses, including
CMV, as a marker of subclinical immune response to psy-
chosocial stressors.24 Increases in herpesvirus antibody titers
have been linked to a wide array of stressors, including
caregiving for a family member with Alzheimer disease,25
involvement in a difficult marriage,26 anticipation of space
flight by astronauts,27 traumatic life events,13 academic stress
in medical students and military cadets,28 as well as psycho-
logical traits of loneliness and anxiety.29 Thus, it is possible
that our results reflect the impact of SES-related psycholog-
ical stress on down-regulation of the cellular immune re-
sponse. Further studies should examine whether stress is an
important factor in the relationship between SES and immune
response to CMV in the US population.
Alternative factors associated with CMV reactivation
include major clinical conditions or treatments such as organ
transplant and immunodeficiency.30,31 These factors are not
likely to explain the differences found in this study because
these conditions are usually correlated with a high level of
reactivation to the point of clinical disease, such as CMV
retinitis and other disorders.32 In addition, we controlled for
the use of medications that indicate altered immune function
such as antivirals, antiretrovirals, and corticosteroids. Anti-
body levels to CMV were assessed by ELISA and therefore
may not necessarily reflect all aspects of cellular immune
response to this virus. Further studies are needed to examine
other markers of subclinical reactivation, such as CMV DNA
shedding, that were not available in this study.
It is possible that increased levels of IgG-specific anti-
bodies may indicate recent primary infection. This is unlikely
to be common in our study population because initial infec-
tion with CMV (as well as reinfection) generally occurs at
young ages.32 There is also no association between household
size and CMV antibody levels in our sample ("household"
being an important surrogate marker of exposure to infection
and increased likelihood of transmission).14,33 CMV IgM anti-
body, which would indicate recent infection or reinfection, was
in NHANES III measured only in women aged 12­49 years. For
those women 25 years and older, only 1.74% tested positive for
CMV IgM, suggesting that primary infection and reinfection are
not important factors in our results.
Higher antibody response may indicate that the dura-
tion of the infection has been longer or that an individual has
been repeatedly exposed throughout life. If this is the case,
then high antibody levels may be a marker for early life or
cumulative socioeconomic variation in level of exposure to
these infections. This hypothesis is consistent with cross-
sectional evidence that at current age-specific rates of sero-
prevalence, persons with less education, lower income, and
nonwhite race are likely to spend a larger number of years
infected with CMV by the time they reach older ages.15
Past history of exposure to pathogens, such as CMV,
may be an important determinant of later life chronic condi-
tions through encouragement of a pro- or anti-inflammatory
status or through gene-environment interactions.2 Socioeco-
nomic status is related to total pathogen burden, including CMV,
HSV-1, and Helicobacter pylori, in the US and UK.34,35 The
causes of increased pathogen burden and earlier acquisition of
persistent pathogens in lower SES individuals are not well
understood. Further studies examining the extent to which these
factors modify immune response and impact chronic conditions
such as cardiovascular disease are warranted.
Given that our measure of comorbidities could be
considered a consequence of both our exposure and outcome
of interest, we examined the possibility that inclusion of the
Charlson index was producing a spurious correlation between
SES and CMV antibody levels. In models excluding the
Dowd and Aiello Epidemiology · Volume 20, Number 6, November 2009
906 | www.epidem.com © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins
Charlson index, coefficient estimates for both income and
education were larger rather than smaller, suggesting that
comorbidities are likely a mediating factor between SES and
antibody levels but unlikely to have introduced an upward
bias in our estimates.
There were some differences in our findings by sex. In
models including both education and income, education was
more strongly linked to CMV levels for women, whereas
income was associated more strongly for men. This could
reflect substantive differences in the pathways linking SES
and health, whereby job-related characteristics reflected in
income are more important for immune response in men. It
has also been suggested that all household members may not
have equal access to household income, and that household
income may be a less accurate measure of the resources
available to women.36
Limitations to these data included the right-censoring
of a substantial fraction of our CMV observations, which did
not allow a complete picture of the distribution of this
outcome variable. Fortunately, censored regression tech-
niques were able to incorporate the information provided in
these top-coded values. As in many large population surveys,
there was nontrivial item nonresponse, especially for income.
Although those missing income data were slightly more
likely to be women with less education, this group did not
differ by CMV antibody levels.
A limitation to the use of CMV IgG antibody in general
is the use of qualitative ELISA assays for CMV detection,
making comparisons across studies difficult. Nonetheless,
within studies, elevated CMV antibodies have been linked to
important health risks. In a community-sample of elderly
Latinos in the US, CMV antibody levels in the highest
quartile were associated with greater all-cause mortality risk,
decreased physical functioning, and increased cognitive de-
cline.9,37,38 There are few data to indicate standard and
recognized risk categories for antibody levels among gener-
ally healthy individuals, making it difficult to specify cate-
gories of risk. For now, qualitative sample based differences,
such as being in the top quartile category of antibody levels,
may be the most salient indicator for health risk. This is akin
to how cytokines, such as IL-6, are considered as risk factors
for cardiovascular health in large-scale studies such as the
Framingham Heart Study39 and the Women's Health Study.40
While beyond the scope of this study, further research is
needed to assess whether high antibody levels to CMV in the
NHANES population are a risk factor for chronic health
conditions such as cardiovascular disease.
Whether through subclinical reactivation due to stress,
or through a longer period of immune system engagement
due to earlier infection, SES differences in immune control
over CMV may have fundamental implications for health.
Future work should test the extent to which cell-mediated
immunity, as measured by CMV antibody levels, can explain
socioeconomic gradients in specific health outcomes such as
cardiovascular disease and mortality. The role of CMV in
immune system and inflammatory changes suggests the pos-
sibility of large public health benefits associated with a CMV
vaccine. In the absence of a vaccine, future work should
identify the causes of socioeconomic disparities in both CMV
seroprevalence and immunity in the US population, to lessen
the disproportionate health burden associated with this per-
sistent viral infection.
