Introduction
The dual ambition in this article is to trace how three differ-
ent but interlinked discourses--development, gender, and
environment--came together historically in ideology, theory,
and practice to promote poverty reduction, and to identify
emerging and contemporary synergies between them in that
effort. There are several reasons why one should study it, the
main being that--despite real accomplishments--poverty
reduction efforts in the past have been "too few, too slow,
and inept" (Agola & Awange, 2013). Furthermore, people
who are poor often depend on environmental resources for
their survival and, while many users are women, few control
the resources on which they depend, as partly, but not solely,
explained by existing gender regimes (D. Rocheleau,
Thomas-Slayter, & Wangari, 2013; World Bank, 2012).
As a major historical project, development is criticized for
not having delivered what it promised in terms of economic
growth, political freedom, poverty reduction, and social
change (Isbister, 2006). Repeatedly, feminists have criticized
development for its insufficient analysis of women, gender,
and intersectionality (Elson, 2009) and for dichotomizing
women into either marginalized and vulnerable victims or
agents of change (Razavi, 2012), representing an "untapped
resource" for development (Moser, 2012). Although efforts to
engender theory and policy gave rise to "gender and devel-
opment" as an institutionalized field, it has been, and still is,
a contested subdiscipline (Benería, 1995; Cornwall, Harrison,
& Whitehead, 2007). At present, in times of global environ-
mental change, development is criticized for its incapacity to
redefine development beyond conventional economic growth
and for not taking environmental degradation and ecological
limits seriously enough (Olsson et al., 2014; Stiglitz, Sen, &
Fitoussi, 2009). Hopes are, therefore, high that climate change
responses informed by sustainability will embody institu-
tional, structural, or transformational opportunities to reduce
poverty and turn vulnerability into well-being--no longer
should poverty be addressed only as a core element of devel-
opment but also, or more so, as a persistent social problem
intertwined with global inequality and environmental change.
The current analysis draws on scholarly work that is pur-
posively sampled with the dual ambition in mind. It is
focused on the three discourses of development, gender, and

Understanding Poverty: Seeking Synergies
Between the Three Discourses of
Development, Gender, and Environment
Anne Jerneck1
Abstract
Policies and strategies to fight global environmental degradation, gender inequality, and poverty are often inadequate,
ineffective, or insufficient. In response, this article seeks potential synergies and leverage points between three significant
interrelated discourses that are often treated separately--development, gender, and environment. Proceeding from a brief
history of development thinking and poverty definitions, I describe indicators, strategies, and approaches to poverty reduction
and gender equality. Second, I analyze how targeting, mainstreaming, and market-based initiatives all fail both to distinguish
empirical from analytical gender and to incorporate environment and gender into development policy and action--despite
their key role in meeting the normative goal of poverty reduction. Third, through a political-ecology lens, I suggest an
integrated approach to poverty, inequality, and socioenvironmental challenges that arise at the intersections of development,
gender, and environment, and for that, I draw examples from research on social and environmental change and action in
sub-Saharan Africa.

the environment. All three are particularly relevant to pov-
erty and inequality but are rarely brought together under joint
scrutiny, although that is called for and becoming more fre-
quent in critical geography (Sultana, 2014), feminist political
ecology (Elmhirst, 2011; Nightingale, 2011; D. Rocheleau
et al., 2013), and gender and sustainability debates (Cruz-
Torres & McElwee, 2012; Meinzen-Dick, Kovarik, &
Quisumbing, 2014). In search of synergies, I situate the anal-
ysis within the scope of political ecology serving as an over-
all lens to examine how the three selected discourses have
already, and may further, converge on poverty reduction
strategies while taking global-to-local inequality and sustain-
ability seriously. As a critical problem-solving approach with
policy implications for integrated social and biophysical
phenomena, political ecology is shaped by several distinct
features such as multiple audiences, methods, objectives, and
scales focusing on chains of explanations in local to global
agency and structures (D. E. Rocheleau, 2008).
The text is outlined as follows. First, I offer a succinct
introduction to the main ideas of development as a major
historical and international project. I include a short review
of how poverty as a key issue is defined, understood, and
tackled in development theory and practice. Second, and as
another key issue, I review how initiatives on "women" and
"gender" were mainstreamed into development, and how
women, gender, and the environment were first ignored or
neglected but later became core categories in policies and
interventions on poverty reduction. Third, I turn to how envi-
ronmental concerns gained attention in the global debate,
how development and environment come together in theory
and practice in ecological modernization, and how poverty
reduction policies were later formulated in line with that,
often with market-based instruments as a solution despite
their limitations. Finally, I seek leverage between the dis-
courses and discuss how research can draw on integrated
approaches as a way forward to invigorate strategies and
action. For that, I offer a chart of empirical examples draw-
ing on sustainability science research in sub-Saharan Africa.
As a cautionary remark to the informed reader, I should
point out that by tracing debates over time and by placing the
current state of the subject matter into an historical frame, it
becomes clear that some aspects and arguments have not
changed considerably over the last decade or more. In particu-
lar, it is worth mentioning that neither the grounding narrative
on gendered perceptions and experiences of poverty in the
global South nor the methods for observing, documenting, or
analyzing such data from a gendered perspective have changed
much. In the current analysis, that is a finding in itself.
Development and Poverty in Theory
and Practice
In theory and practice, development is a problem-based, nor-
mative, and solutions-oriented discourse (Pieterse, 2010).
Rooted in political ideology, it entails policies, strategies, and
interventions of every shade from Marxism to liberalism,
from neo-Marxism to neoliberalism, from ecologism to fem-
inism, to postdevelopment. It was long understood as devel-
opmentalism--a process of social change that can be thought
of, planned, and implemented as a top-down strategy of poli-
cies and interventions. In the 1970s, this was paralleled or
replaced by participatory and people-oriented approaches
emphasizing ownership and partnership (Brohman, 1996).
As a postwar project for poverty reduction and political
independence, development turned into an endeavor of
nation-building and economic growth (Sumner & Tribe,
2008). It gave rise to a huge institutional and organizational
apparatus of global initiatives, international agencies,
national authorities, and local organizations--all aiming for
a better future in the global South. In the quest for freedom
and well-being, the development project attracted massive
flows of capital and technology not only from the global
North to the South but also between countries in the global
South (Jönsson, Jerneck, & Arvidson, 2012). Furthermore,
industrialized countries in the North promoted nation-build-
ing in the South around the institutions of an open market
economy and multiparty democracy but with greater weight
attached to the former on the basis that democracy would
follow from market-based economic growth. The newly
independent countries were, however, disadvantaged in their
economic transformation by having to compete in open mar-
kets with the North and often having to take on significant
public debts for infrastructure-building and other projects;
this had the effect of perpetuating the adverse terms of trade
and high levels of economic dependence on primary exports
that had been features also of the colonial period (Singer,
1950). Ambitions to alleviate entrenched poverty were,
therefore, hard to fulfill (Isbister, 2006).
Poverty Reduction in Development Discourses
As a widespread, persistent, and deeply rooted social and
historical problem, poverty has been addressed, defined, and
debated for centuries (Ravallion, 2011). It has been bound up
with the development discourse since the very start, and its
alleviation is often seen as an outcome of economic growth
(Rist, 2002). However, in the literature, there is broad agree-
ment that poverty reduction also requires an effective state
(Leftwich, 2005). Currently, poverty is generally understood
in terms of multicausal origins, multidimensional features,
and multiscalar effects (United Nations Development
Programme, 2010). This means that poverty is not only about
destitution or maldistribution of material and immaterial
assets and resources but also about social exclusion, cultural
marginalization, and the process of being deprived of pros-
pects and opportunities.
Definitions of poverty are abundant and varied. Poverty
can be absolute or relative, individual or systemic, material
or symbolic, objective or subjective, descriptive or explana-
tory. It is not fixed in time or space and not easily captured in
Jerneck 3
a single dimension or definition. It shifts between seasons
and settings; is temporary or transient over the life cycle of a
person, family, or community; and varies across gendered
and generational boundaries within the same household
(Jönsson et al., 2012). Although often presented as a mone-
tary or social proxy measured in access to education, health
facilities, and other services (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, 2014), it is also a multifaceted lived experi-
ence involving individual, cognitive, and emotional experi-
ences (Olsson & Jerneck, 2010). Beyond that, poverty is
relational and systemic, ranging from agency to structure and
from changes in individual practices to altered institutional
arrangements. Successful poverty reduction efforts thus
involve complex politics necessitating economic, political,
and social initiatives and interventions, as we will see below.
The understanding of poverty reduction and of how it
depends on economic growth and (fair) distribution has var-
ied historically and theoretically across the boundaries of
competing development schools and ideologies (Hulme,
2013). In the early decades of development (1950-1980),
modernization theory advocated international economic
integration and predicted broad-based economic conver-
gence. According to projections, economic growth would
deliver poverty reduction and rising living standards to close
the gaps between North and South, rich and poor, urban and
rural, men and women. Proponents of modernization theory
believed that economic growth would "trickle down" from
North to South--via trade, technology transfer, and other
transactions--and spread widely in societies in the South.
After the economic crisis in 2009, the effectiveness of the
mechanism was finally refuted (Quiggin, 2009) but before
that, it was already highly contested by critics (some of
whom are feminist) who observed how inequality is rooted
in class, race, gender, and space (Agarwal, 1986) and in
remaining colonial structures (Brohman, 1995).
In parallel, and in contrast to modernization theory, struc-
turalist researchers calculated how international trade
resulted in divergence and thus advocated protectionism and
the promotion of massive private and public investments in
state-directed industrialization to "catch up" with technolog-
ical change, economic growth, and rising living standards in
the West (Singer, 1950). Scholars of dependency theory went
even further, proposing a radical reorientation and "delink-
ing" from the prosperous Center (North) to reduce further
exploitation of the "underdeveloped" Periphery (South),
which had already for centuries been deeply penetrated and
transformed. While liberal thinkers considered trade to be a
superior means to integrate the South further into the world
market and thus reduce poverty through convergence,
Keynesian scholars stressed that aid and assistance are cru-
cial to bring about growth and social change. In opposition,
postcolonial thinkers shifted the focus not only from aid ver-
sus trade but away from poverty altogether to critically scru-
tinize the power of the dominant Western discourse for its
"colonization of the mind." And while human rights­based
approaches called for the recognition of rights and concrete
outcomes to overcome local to global injustice and inequal-
ity, postdevelopment scholars went even further to think
beyond the development project altogether.
Economic divergence continued to increase despite new
policy frames, forceful development strategies, and mas-
sive investments in extractive industries. The international
community and many national governments, therefore, had
to intensify their fight against poverty. This was done by
focusing directly on "the poor" in initiatives that still
assumed convergence but were designed to promote par-
ticipatory pro-poor growth processes. As examples of the
major top-down or bottom-up international efforts, the
United Nations launched a program in 1974 for establish-
ing a New International Economic Order (United Nations,
1974; White, 1975), the International Labor Organization
(ILO) designed a Basic Needs Approach in 1976 (ILO,
1977; Singh, 1979), and in 1980, the esteemed develop-
ment thinker Robert Chambers suggested a participatory
method for rapid rural appraisals to be used both in research
and in policy initiatives for rural poverty alleviation and
agricultural development (Chambers, 1981). His method
gave prominence to what people have and do, thus shifting
the focus from human incapacity to human assets and activ-
ities. Later on, it developed into the agency-based sustain-
able livelihoods framework (Chambers & Conway, 1991).
Also neoliberalism as the emerging world order advocated
special policies for "pro-poor growth" but as often con-
firmed in development practice, the "poorest of the poor"
are difficult to attract, reach, and involve in targeted efforts
due to their marginalized position in the economy and in
society at large (Jerneck & Olsson, 2010; Olsson et al.,
2014).
Indicators and Imagery of Poverty
The many above-mentioned efforts and initiatives to speed
up poverty reduction are associated with different attempts to
assess and measure poverty and inequality. In the 1990s,
Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum suggested a Human
Development Index (HDI) and a Gender Development Index
(GDI) as composite indicators for the Human Development
Reports published by the United Nations (Nussbaum, Sen, &
Sugden, 1993). In 2000, the World Bank launched a three-
pronged bottom-up approach to promote socioeconomic
opportunities and facilitate empowerment while enhancing
security for the sake of poverty reduction (World Bank, 2000).
In parallel, the World Bank initiated the project, Voices of the
Poor, to map and explain drivers of poverty as experienced
by and heard from 60,000 people in the global South (Narayan,
Chambers, Shah, & Petesch, 2000). This was also the time of
the global partnership of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) established for 2000 to 2015. Given that the MDGs
missed the opportunity to fully integrate human rights and
environmental concerns into poverty reduction strategies,
4 SAGE Open
efforts are strengthened in the succeeding Sustainable
Development Goals (Biermann et al., 2014).
As particular indicators, quantitative aspects are seen as
useful to compare the magnitude of poverty over time and
between countries, whereas qualitative aspects are needed to
identify causal mechanisms and how poverty is experienced
in various settings (Jönsson et al., 2012). To compare poverty
lines and purchasing power parity across borders, some
scholars and practitioners prefer universal indicators
expressed in what they see as objective figures and fre-
quency. To explain recurring periods of hardship and recov-
ery in the everyday life of those who are under pressure from
multiple stressors, others engage with stakeholders and use
qualitative methods to map, depict, and discuss daily, sea-
sonal, or annual predicaments (Gabrielsson, Brogaard, &
Jerneck, 2013; Jerneck & Olsson, 2013; Olsson et al., 2014)
that often arise from a combined food, health, and gender
imperative (Gabrielsson et al., 2013; Jerneck & Olsson,
2013). Hence, aggregation in numbers is necessary to com-
pare the incidence of poverty over time and across borders
whereas disaggregation is needed to locate poverty dynamics
at individual, household, or community levels and for under-
standing causes and consequences (Hulme & Shepherd,
2003).
As reflected in the many varied approaches that policy
makers and practitioners draw on in their design of poverty
reduction strategies, the imagery of "poverty and the poor"
as expressed in definitions, in metaphors, and in myriad
social relations to richer worlds has changed over time and
arguably varies at any one time (Dogra & Cohen, 2012) but
there are constants, too. To sum up thus far, while some look
for a monetary proxy or a single index of welfare, others seek
pathways to expand capabilities, entitlements, and freedom
(Sen, 2013), and others, again, call for antidiscrimination
policies to fight exclusionary dynamics in society (Laderchi,
Saith, & Stewart, 2003) such as racism and sexism.
Strategies and Policy Approaches to Reduce
Poverty
Strategies for poverty alleviation can, for instance, be classi-
fied into the four types of state-directed, market-based,
social-movement-based, or status-quo-based approaches
(Satterthwaite & Mitlin, 2014). To exemplify, state-directed
policies may include participatory governance, rights-based
initiatives, urban management, and welfare assistance.
Status-quo-based interventions may draw on existing infor-
mal institutions such as "aided self-help" or clientelism that
build on protection and exploitation, thus offering only lim-
ited and rather conditional benefits (Satterthwaite & Mitlin,
2014).
Approaches to measure and compare poverty over time
can be classified into four types: monetary, capability, par-
ticipatory, and social exclusion, each of which draws on a
particular construction of reality with its own particular limi-
tations (Laderchi et al., 2003). The monetary approach is eas-
ily turned into numbers but is one-dimensional and may
conceal other aspects. The capability approach is agency-
based and captures multiple dimensions but is difficult to
aggregate because it builds on individual and personal rather
than collective experiences (Rist, 2002). Participatory
approaches are place-based and grounded but use context
specific indicators that may prevent comparisons between
settings (Laderchi et al., 2003).The social exclusion approach
captures multiple dimensions of social inequality but refers
mainly to excluded groups and segments in society such as
the aged, the disabled, ethnic minorities, and so on, thus tak-
ing a too narrow view. As yet another aspect of poverty, there
is call for critical urban research and action as policy tends to
underestimate the growing magnitude and impact of urban
poverty (Banks, Roy, & Hulme, 2011).
Aradical shift away from existing approaches would be to
focus less on poverty and people who are poor and more on
wealth and riches (Lister, 2004).The latest Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) assessment report has wid-
ened the social science scope and seeks to investigate and
illustrate inequality in more depth (Olsson et al., 2014).
Policies emerging from such research would require struc-
tural and institutional changes toward a fairer distribution of
public goods and services and a more equal provisioning of
education, health care, water, and environmentally sound
and safe energy and sanitation (Laderchi et al., 2003). But
this is at odds with neoliberalism as the dominant paradigm
of our time and would demand a repoliticization of poverty
(Béné, Wood, Newsham, & Davies, 2012) rather than the
current trend to simplify and depoliticize it (Barrett &
Constas, 2014).
Women (Not Gender) at the Core of
Poverty Reduction Policy
In response to persistent poverty and inequalities, gender-
sensitive and people-centered approaches moved to the core
of development from the 1970s (Jackson, 1996). Inspired by
research on equality and in an effort to promote women's
opportunities and well-being, a network of Washington-
based development professionals and practitioners coined
the term WID--"women in development" (Tinker, 1990, p.
30). Embedded in modernization theory and rooted in liberal
feminism and neoclassical economics, it suggested a focal
shift from reproductive to productive work (Wilson, 2011).
In line with development policies on economic efficiency
and equity in opportunities, the WID norm supported "small-
scale income-generating women-only projects" more than it
criticized existing inequalities between women and men
(Krook & True, 2012). Due to the prime focus on "women"
as an empirical category and based on a simplified under-
standing of gender, the structural inequality between women/
Jerneck 5
men and the discursive meaning of femininity/masculinity
were made invisible and lost in the WID initiative. In retro-
spect, it has been pointed out that WID, intentionally or unin-
tentionally, stimulated the efficiency norm and approach to
"invest in women" and in women's production, reproduc-
tion, and motherhood for the benefit of general social gains
such as improved child health, higher levels of food security,
and increasing well-being. In consequence, women ended up
serving development more than development served women.
Later, the efficiency approach to women's agency and wom-
en's capacity to work gained prominence as "smart econom-
ics," which has since then been propagated by several
international organizations (Chant & Sweetman, 2012).
Women as Agents of Change
In the 1980s and 1990s, in the wake of the world economic
crisis and the widespread structural adjustment programs
promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in tandem, cuts in government spending in many
developing countries resulted in tight household budgets
especially in the urban context (Rapley, 1997). To alleviate
economic difficulties, the strategy of conditional cash trans-
fer (CCT) was launched as a public policy to fight poverty
and social exclusion (Rawlings & Rubio, 2005). It offers
opportunities for women as a targeted group but builds on
maternalist gender stereotypes of women working in the ser-
vice of others, mainly their children and families, in a form
of "female altruism" (Molyneux, 2006). Hence, women were
cast as agents of change responsible not only for the better-
ment of themselves and the survival of their families but also
for the recovery of the economy (Chant & Sweetman, 2012).
Similarly, the widespread but controversial system of micro-
finance (Hulme, 2000) targets women on the assumption that
they use money wisely and ultimately pay back loans. But
antipoverty strategies offering land rights and labor market
opportunities to women are both fairer and more effective
than micro-credit loans that are often controlled by men
while signed in the name of women, who thus become
responsible for paying back the loans (Balasubramanian,
2013). Some critics even suggest that micro-credits should
be called micro-debts (Bamford, 2000).
Productive and Reproductive Work
Access to income-generating resources and livelihood
opportunities is governed by social relations manifested
through institutions, organizations, and decision-making
power, and is often found to be at the core of poverty allevia-
tion (De Haan & Zoomers, 2005). But as often noted in the
development literature, women have multiple reproductive
responsibilities besides their productive tasks and "every
dawn brings with it a long march in search of fuel, fodder and
water" (Dankelman, 2002, p. 23). To fulfill such gendered
productive and reproductive responsibilities and obligations,
women often depend on and have the capacity to manage
energy needs and natural resources while having neither the
right to nor control over these same resources (Ryan, 2014).
In many fishing, farming, or forestry communities, this is
illustrated by how women participate in, contribute to, and
arrange production activities while having less (secure)
access not only to natural resources, in terms of land, but also
to social resources such as capital, education, and informa-
tion (Cruz-Torres & McElwee, 2012). However, the dual
responsibility of having to tend to both reproductive and pro-
ductive activities may, in fact, enhance women's bargaining
power as well as their capacity to meet not only basic needs
in the family but also their own strategic needs (Kabeer,
2012).
Targeting Women or Mainstreaming Gender
Feminists and other critical thinkers have examined how
development and poverty reduction are associated with par-
ticular notions or chains of notions tying one term to another,
such as "women and work" (Jackson, 1996); agency, effi-
ciency, and entrepreneurship (Wilson, 2011); and participa-
tion and empowerment (Cornwall & Brock, 2005; O'Meally,
2014). Many have noted that while some programs "target"
the poor specifically (as a group) others "mainstream" pov-
erty and gender (as social relations) into development poli-
cies. Both perspectives are problematic. Targeting means
portraying and addressing people who are poor (often
women) as victims and/or beneficiaries whereas gender
mainstreaming often means seeing women (but rarely men)
as agents not only contributing to but also being responsible
for the survival and well-being of their families, communi-
ties, and whole economy. For a long time, investments in
generations of women as mothers, community builders, and
"agents of well-being" have run as a common thread through
development initiatives. By linking the domestic to the pub-
lic sphere, while separating the domains in intricate ways,
women are made liable for the well-being of others (Tabbush,
2010), and work burdens are reinforced (Blackden & Wodon,
2006).
Instrumental or Intrinsic Value
Critiques have also argued that "positive" representations of
women as entrepreneurs and educators of their children are
associated with a notion of agency that is both consistent
with and necessary for neoliberal capitalism (Wilson, 2011,
p. 328). But if poverty is a classed and gendered experience,
then policies to reduce poverty "are not necessarily appropri-
ate to tackling gender issues"--especially if poverty reduc-
tion is prioritized while gender discrimination, oppression,
and violence are neglected (Jackson, 1996, p. 501). Notably,
the first World Development Report ever to focus on gender
recognized that besides its instrumental value for economic
growth and poverty reduction, as discussed above in terms of
6 SAGE Open
women as agents of development, gender equality has intrin-
sic value as "a core goal in and of itself" (World Bank, 2011,
p. 3). Critical perspectives would prioritize the intrinsic
value of strengthening women (and men) in their own right,
but warn against initiatives based on the instrumental value
of making women into a means to control fertility (to stabi-
lize population growth) while reducing poverty and achiev-
ing sustainability (Elson, 2009; Razavi, 2012).
To sum up thus far, the focus in poverty reduction policies
and strategies has shifted over time from specific develop-
ment aspects--basic needs, gender equality, rural develop-
ment--to more diffuse (neo)liberal notions such as "equity
in opportunities" (World Bank, 2005) only to drift back again
to specific aspects such as education, human security, public
health, and reproductive rights. Policies have varied from
including and targeting "women" to "mainstreaming gender"
while becoming increasingly diffuse in goal and means, and
from prioritizing the efficiency gained from the instrumental
value of women's contributions to underlining the intrinsic
value of gender equality.
From Counting to Critical Reflexivity--From
Empirical to Analytical Gender
In relation to policy, it is a long-standing feminist argument
that gender is not adequately conceptualized or represented
in decision-making arenas (Kettel, 1996). This is unfortunate
given the fact that the feminist lens on development has
shifted from "women in" or "gender and" to the "gendering
of" social relations. This methodological turn from individ-
ual to relational helped identify how economic, political, and
social institutions contribute to reproduce and reinforce gen-
der regimes and practices. In development policy and prac-
tice, there are, in principle, four broad approaches for how to
address gender, each of which has its own particular focus,
issues, and methods. Accordingly, gender studies have
changed from measuring variables to seeing gender as a fun-
damental analytical category and as part of higher order pro-
cesses in society. With that, gender has shifted from studies
of patriarchy and subordination toward studies of complex
social institutions, practices, and structures that span the
public­private divide. In addition, gender is often found to
be dynamic and continuously negotiated in processes that are
embedded in norms and values influenced by diffuse and
widely dispersed power (Kenny, 2007). Four typical
approaches can be distinguished here: counting women and
men, analyzing gender as social relations, explaining identity
and diversity beyond gender and into intersectionality, and
reflexive questioning of knowledge production (Reed &
Mitchell, 2003).
First, and to illustrate this further, the counting approach
includes individuals (women and men), gendered activities,
and gendered contributions from that. Although it challenges
gender-neutral categories, it may overstate women's uniform
conditions and only suggest corrections to existing practices
rather than promoting profound (and necessary) structural
change in social norms (Marchand & Parpart, 2003). The
second approach, which analyzes gender as a relational con-
struct, includes the study of social norms and the dynamics
of gendered regimes while focusing on how institutions are
numerically and culturally dominated by men and male
norms. This approach seeks to explain gendered differences
and inequalities in power but not necessarily how gender and
other social dimensions intersect to create asymmetric and
ever more complex power relations.
The third approach recognizes that gender intersects with
other social categories, thus being diversely experienced and
going beyond essentialism. This approach is, however, less
able to seek unity across diverse interests or to offer general
statements that may serve policy making. The fourth
approach stresses partiality, subjectivity, and reflexivity and
is concerned with feminist critique of epistemologies. It
deals with questions such as what counts as knowledge and
how is knowledge legitimized, produced, and represented?
The challenge here is to recognize fluidity in identity and
subject formation while seeking to make claims that are pre-
cise enough to be policy relevant. Importantly, and to sum
up, the meaning of gender, also in the context of develop-
ment, must be understood along at least two different lines--
the empirical meaning referring to the categories of women
and men and how they are differently affected by or affect
social change, and the analytical meaning referring to the
dimensions of femininity and masculinity in how power is
produced in social relations and in language (Peterson,
2005). To consider both is an attempt to avoid simplification
and deepen the understanding--but also the complexity--of
gender.
Recoding Gender in the Quest for Development
As regards flexibility in how to interpret and reinterpret gen-
der, culturally contingent norms are often contested, chal-
lenged, or changed in times of major technological
transformation or social upheaval such as agrarian reform or
revolution, economic boom or crisis, war or postconflict
recovery, natural disaster or climate change events. Asia and
Africa exhibit interesting and well-known historical exam-
ples of such events and processes characterized by fluidity in
gender. In socialist China, women would "do everything that
men could do" in productive labor during the intensive polit-
ical mass mobilization of peasants in the 1950s and 1960s. In
rapidly industrializing and modernizing postwar Japan,
many women left the domestic sphere to enter the labor mar-
ket in the economic boom of the 1960s. In conflict ridden
Vietnam, women gained higher administrative and political
positions when men were mobilized in war in the 1960s; and
in postconflict Rwanda, women won every second parlia-
mentary seat based on the new 2003 Constitution.
Jerneck 7
These major transformative gains may be unintended and
unexpected and also fragile and short-lived.After an "event,"
things may soon revert to "normal." In Japan, many women
returned to the domestic sphere when the economic boom
slowed down into a recession in the 1990s; in Vietnam,
women lost their prominent positions at the end of the war in
1975 when men demobilized and reentered the administra-
tion; and women who were active in the social movement of
the Arab spring in 2011 lost their seats in the reform commit-
tees set up after the revolution (Hassan, 2012). The position
of women (and men) in the economy and society is thus rein-
terpreted over time often in line with the dominant discourse.
Kabeer (2011) argues that although empowerment processes
are path dependent, there is scope for people's ability, capac-
ity, and willingness in a given setting or situation to adapt to,
react against, or alter the social constraints and gendered
norms to which they are subject. Kabeer (2011) speaks of
women's ability to participate on equal terms with men in
reshaping society, women's capacity to exercise strategic
control over one's life, and women's willingness to question
one's position in society. As a gender-sensitive typology that
may serve to deepen the analysis on such power in social
relations, it covers four varieties: "power to," meaning the
ability to adapt, improve, or transform; "power with," involv-
ing a joint action with other people; "power over," in the
sense of challenging and overcoming subjugation; and
"power within," as an individual cognitive process of confi-
dence and consciousness (De Haan & Zoomers, 2005).
"Involving women while ignoring gender."Ester Boserup
(1970), an early proponent of gender equality in develop-
ment, argues that women should be (better) integrated into
the economy to reap (more) benefits from modernization.
Against this, radical feminist scholars argued that women
were already integrated in the economy as seen in their con-
tribution to production and reproduction (Benería & Sen,
1981), often to the extent that their labor was exploited in
low-paid wage work and through time-consuming gendered
obligations in reproduction--thus a heavy workload and lit-
erally a double burden. It was argued that interventions seek-
ing to involve women often ignore gender, thus seriously
overlooking the role of men and masculinity in the economy
and society. This is exemplified by how women who enter
public positions and productive work often remain in charge
of reproductive work as these are more resistant to change or
recoding (Resurreccion, 2011). In consequence, the many
concerns around women's workloads, "care loads," and time
poverty have gradually been gender mainstreamed into
development thinking and practice (Blackden & Wodon,
2006) but often with a focus on what women do rather than
on what men could do to contribute to productive and repro-
ductive work.
To sum up, we have seen how the notions of "women"
and "gender" emerged and were used interchangeably or
even ambiguously in development initiatives. We will now
turn to how the gendering of social and natural resources in
the environment debate started to be incorporated into the
development discourse, first with an emphasis on women
and then shifting the emphasis to gender (Jackson, 1998;
Leach, 2007).
Starting to Identify the Dynamics:
Development, Gender, and
Environment
In the gender literature, it is argued that vulnerability (and
adaptive capacity) in relation to natural disasters is neither a
fixed nor an intrinsic characteristic of certain people or
groups of people (Enarson, 1998) or derived from a single
social dimension like being poor, rural, woman, or part of a
particular (or marginalized) community (Blaikie et al., 1997).
If vulnerability is associated with differentiated and chang-
ing circumstances before, during, and after a disaster (Blaikie
et al., 1997) and depends on historically or culturally deter-
mined conditions (Enarson, 1998), then it is less of an indi-
vidual or personalized characteristic and more of a structural,
relational, and process-oriented condition. The capacity of
women and men to reduce their respective vulnerability may
depend significantly on gender norms and rules that define
and regulate the use of space and other resources, including
the power and control associated with that; but when estab-
lished norms clash with emerging needs in households that
are poor, vulnerable, or exposed to multiple stressors, this
may create space for negotiation of and fluidity in gender
(Jabeen, 2014).
"Being Close to Nature"--In Ecofeminism and
WED (Women, Environment, Development)
In the development and environment debate, especially
within ecofeminism and WED, it has often been argued that
"women are closer to nature, are hardest hit by environmen-
tal degradation, and have special knowledge of natural
resource systems" (Resurrección, 2013, p. 33). From this fol-
lows that women run the potential risk that development
interventions will pass the burden of conservation on to them
as main caretakers, protectors, or even saviors of natural
resources and the environment (Resurrección, 2013). But
ecofeminist notions seeing women as per definition naturally
connected to nature or having special skills and knowledge
to manage environmental resources (Shiva, 1988) have been
criticized by feminist scholars, some of which feel an "intel-
lectual unease" with the idea of a single "feminine subject"
who is "close to nature" (Resurrección, 2013, p. 33). In con-
trast, critics see identity and subjectivity as fluid, fragmented,
multidimensional, and constituted of age, class, race, place,
and other axes of power rather than as fixed, centered, and
one-dimensional (Elmhirst & Resurreccion, 2008). A better
understanding of agency could emerge from an intersectional
8 SAGE Open
analysis of natural resource management and environmental
recovery, and such studies of flexibility in gender in relation
to nature are now seen in the literature on forestry and water
management (Leach, 2007). Here, "situated knowledge" and
"social reproduction" are useful concepts to help reveal how
spatial locations shape everyday activities and practices and
how that relates to what people know about the environment
and how they respond to environmental stressors (Bee,
Madge, & Wellens, 1998). Social inequality in resource man-
agement and climate change responses may not only be rein-
forced but, thus, also contested and changed when social
meanings of identity are played out and power is performed
(Nightingale, 2009). In the following, I will examine how
development engages with debates on environment and sus-
tainability and how ecology and economy get intertwined in
initiatives on poverty reduction.
The Rise of Ecological Modernization
The coevolution of development and environmental con-
cerns can be summarized in three important waves (Mol,
1997). In the 1960s, the first wave was concerned with the
degradation and pollution of natural landscapes seeing nature
conservation as the main policy response. In the 1970s, the
second wave was manifested in the UN Conference on the
Human Environment in Stockholm (in 1972). This made it
obvious that environment and development could no longer
be treated separately but had to be addressed simultaneously.
In parallel, a more radical and socially informed wave made
a plea for an ecologically sound society but achieved very
little in terms of institutional change. In the 1980s, the third
and most influential wave coincided with the publishing of
the politically commissioned report Our Common Future
(World Commission on Environment and Development,
1987) wherein ecology and economy were integrated into a
common frame that later became known as ecological mod-
ernization (Jänicke, 2008). Its main assumption, that eco-
nomic growth can solve both poverty and environmental
degradation, was epitomized by the UN Conference on
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in
1992 and Agenda 21 as a first major initiative to combine
poverty reduction with environmental conservation, espe-
cially in the local context. This reflects how environmental
concerns were mainstreamed into modernization theory as
the dominant development theory.
Even if meanings differ among and between scholars,
four main traits are important to ecological modernization.
First, modern science and technology is important for ecolo-
gizing the economy. Second, it is argued that since there is no
inherent conflict between the economy and the environment,
we should harness market instruments for sustainable devel-
opment by internalizing externalities in a commodity
approach--economizing ecology. Third, the state should enter
public­private partnerships and become proactive in mobiliz-
ing private actors to take initiatives toward sustainability such
as in strategies on corporate social responsibility. Fourth,
social movements will have to change from primarily being
watchdogs to become active participants in and agents of
sustainable development (Mol, 1997).
Ecological modernization as theory and practice emerged
in tandem with the neoliberal ideology and the match
between them paved the way for liberal environmentalism or
"green neoliberalism" (Bakker, 2010). In the context of
development, this is illustrated by the outcome of the Rio+20
conference reiterating the need to promote initiatives on sus-
tainable development that "contribute to eradicating poverty
as well as sustained economic growth . . . while maintaining
the healthy functioning of the Earth's ecosystems" (United
Nations, 2012, Section III, para. 56). Concretely, this think-
ing is evident in how the World Bank shifted from imposing
structural adjustment programs and austerity in the 1980s to
promote a green economy in the 1990s--defined as a clean,
resource-efficient, and resilient economy (Hallegatte, Heal,
Fay, & Treguer, 2012). The change in World Bank policy was
seen as necessary, efficient, and affordable (Fay, 2012) and
as of late, it is taken further toward equity goals by becoming
"inclusive green growth" (Fay, 2012). Dominant interna-
tional players thus have the power to set the agenda by main-
streaming ideas on development, fairness, and the
environment and pair it with a matching vocabulary with
political implications such as "green growth," "equity in
opportunities," "inclusive green growth," or "resilience"
(Olsson, Jerneck, Thoren, Persson, & O'Byrne, 2015).
Ecology and Economics Coming Together
The evolution of the concept of ecosystem services may
exemplify how scientific thinking about the environment and
development is affected by neoliberalism. In the late 1970s,
the concept was launched to increase the public awareness of
biodiversity conservation. In the 1980s, it was mainstreamed
into the environmental policy literature and operationalized
by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Reid et al., 2005)
to subsequently be implemented as Payment for Ecosystem
Services (PES) in the 2000s (Gómez-Baggethun, De Groot,
Lomas, & Montes, 2010). Many ecologists uncritically
embraced the integration of ecosystem services into a neolib-
eral agenda that promoted market-based instruments (Daily
et al., 2009; Jones-Walters & Mulder, 2009; Kumar, 2010).
And, to be noted here, environmental protection and poverty
strategies now shifted from state to market, implying a major
change in authority and institutional arrangements from state
regulation to market-oriented solutions justified by the long-
term need to tackle poverty and foster development (Ten
Brink, 2011). Similarly, the concept of social-ecological sys-
tems (SESs) emerged in response to the need to improve
management and governance of degrading ecosystems
(Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2003). Here, the stress on self-
organization and resilience provided a smooth link to the
neoliberal idea of free markets (Walker & Cooper, 2011).
Jerneck 9
Speaking of resilience, the concept generally refers to how
systems manage, persist, or even thrive in a world of unfore-
seeable socioecological events or disruptions, and as such, it
has gained prominence while also being subject to severe
critique for not being an effective analytical tool to capture or
address the dynamics of poverty (Béné et al., 2012).
Combining Development and Environment in
Market-Based Instruments
PES is a paradigmatic image of how environmental manage-
ment and poverty reduction can be promoted in the global
neoliberal economy. It is a voluntary transaction wherein a
well-defined environmental service or a land-use activity
likely to secure that service is bought by one or several ser-
vice buyers from one or several service providers, if, and
only if, the service providers secure service provision
(Wunder, Engel, & Pagiola, 2008). Inspired by a large-scale
scheme in Costa Rica, Pago por Servicios Ambientales, PES
received much attention as a market-based instrument for
efficiency and effectiveness in environmental management
in developing countries (Pagiola, 2008). Besides, it is often
assumed that PES can contribute to reduce poverty even if it
was not primarily designed for that (Pagiola, Arcenas, &
Platais, 2004) and even if empirical evidence is lacking
(Ingram, 2012).
While environmental sciences seem enthusiastic about
the prospects of combining social and environmental bene-
fits (Wunder, 2005), development scholars are cautious
(Daw, Brown, Rosendo, & Pomeroy, 2011) or outright nega-
tive in that they see PES as neocolonial resource appropria-
tion or "green grabbing" (Fairhead, Leach, & Scoones,
2012). PES builds on globally dominant conceptions of envi-
ronmental justice that are not necessarily aligned with those
of local stakeholders (Martin, Gross-Camp, Kebede,
McGuire, & Munyarukaza, 2014), and although PES primar-
ily has an environmental rather than a social focus (Wunder,
2008), its socioeconomic effectiveness is influenced not only
by ecological conditions but also by social relations (Adhikari
& Boag, 2013).
The potential of PES to reduce poverty is heterogeneous
and always context-dependent (Adhikari & Boag, 2013).
The chances to achieve the dual policy goal of poverty alle-
viation and environmental protection, by using PES in inte-
grated approaches, depend on the coincidence of at least
three interrelated spatial and social conditions: people who
are poor must have access to ecosystems with a potential to
deliver high-value ecosystem services, opportunity costs in
delivering these services must be low, and the scope to intro-
duce perverse incentives in the PES scheme must be lim-
ited--for example, in shifting environmental stress from the
areas covered by the PES scheme to areas that are not cov-
ered, in the sense of saving one forest while cutting down
another, that is, the notion of leakage (Allwood, Bosetti,
Dubash, Gómez-Echeverri, & von Stechow, 2014). It is pos-
sible that these eligibility criteria will limit the potential
effectiveness of PES schemes. In addition, empirical evi-
dence from Brazil indicates that law enforcement is more
effective to reduce deforestation than market-based initia-
tives (Arima, Barreto, Araújo, & Soares-Filho, 2014; Gibbs
et al., 2015; Lapola et al., 2014; Nepstad et al., 2014) but as
of yet, there seems to be little gender differentiated evidence.
In addition, power asymmetries in access to natural resources
and services may contribute to reproduce existing inequali-
ties (Kosoy & Corbera, 2010; Krause & Loft, 2013), and as
regards gender and PES, there is need for more research on
how gender regimes matter in the context of access to,
dependence on, and use of land and labor as socioecological
resources.
From a gender perspective, and as pointed out by Baruah
(2015), green growth policies will have to consider that
women generally have weaker access to new technologies
and more often are poorly represented in construction, infra-
structure, and renewable energy. For a green economy to be
equitable and vibrant, it will have to avoid curtailing the
access to public commons and instead involve people who
are poor and engaged in the informal economy or otherwise
disenfranchised in society (Tandon, 2012). Doing so, it will
have to consider their perils and priorities in how they depend
on and use resources (Tandon, 2012). For this to happen, and
to be sustained, it is not enough to facilitate entry into a green
economy, it is also necessary to back the entry up by wider
and socially progressive policies including access to public
services in general.
Contrasting Arguments
In times of both economic and ecological crises (Jessop,
2012), polarization is increasing between two competing dis-
courses that both claim sustainability with poverty reduction.
The dominant discourse of ecological modernization, led by
the United Nations and the World Bank, reiterates the need
for sustainable development by "promoting sustained, inclu-
sive and equitable economic growth" (United Nations, 2012,
Article 4) as echoed by the World Bank promoting "green
growth" (Dercon, 2012). In reaction, a growing critical
scholarly debate, inspired by ideas from Marx and Polanyi,
argues for counterbalancing forces that operate against the
increasing reliance on markets in environmental governance
(Arsel & Büscher, 2012). Likewise, the critical concepts of
postdevelopment and degrowth are gaining traction both in
academia (Kallis, 2011) and as a source of social movements
(Demaria, Schneider, Sekulova, & Martinez-Alier, 2013).
The highly divisive debate on food regimes may serve to
illustrate this polarization between mainstream depoliticized
pleas for technology driven food security (Godfray et al.,
2010) versus politically transformative peasant movements
to achieve sovereignty (Holt-Giménez & Altieri, 2013).

Conclusion
The aim of the article was to identify and compare approaches
and policies to poverty eradication in three different but inter-
linked debates--development, gender, and environment--and
to investigate the continuity and change in arguments over
time while also looking for synergies across debates. The anal-
ysis makes it clear that although foci and visions may shift
over time, certain aspects and institutions remain constant. To
exemplify, framings of women and gender in the poverty alle-
viation and development debate are reproduced throughout
the environmental debate despite repeated critique from femi-
nist, political ecology, and other critical perspectives.
Summing Up the Argument
Three major processes have influenced development theory
and practice over time, the radicalization in the late 1960s,
the gendering of development in the 1970s, and the greening
of development in the 1980s. At the time of the economic
crisis in the 1980s, there was a conservative pendulum swing,
and neoclassical economics resurged to fit into the emerging
neoliberal ideology that has dominated ever since. Owing to
competing perspectives on the core development issues of
economic growth, poverty reduction, and social change,
many concepts have been contested, revisited, and reconsid-
ered while some remain over time. From the discussion, I
sum up three main points on poverty, gender, and environ-
ment, and how they come together in poverty reduction in
the development field.
First, on poverty, knowledge expanded over time from
growth-oriented and monetary-based approaches to multidi-
mensional perspectives emphasizing how human develop-
ment is gained in processes of capacitation, participation,
empowerment, and distribution of rights. The necessity to
expand definitions on poverty beyond economic aspects is
widely recognized in the debates on development and gen-
der. The importance of (and controversies around) the many
varied processes involved in poverty reduction strategies
such as capacitation, empowerment, and participation--and
how they involve gender--is also recognized. Despite this
broader view, poverty reduction policies are still often
expressed in narrow monetary and measurable terms empha-
sizing economic growth, quantitative indicators, and specific
targeting of marginalized groups.
Second, on women and gender, knowledge has changed
from counting women, observing women's practices, and mea-
suring women's work to theorizing how social relations, insti-
tutions, and practices are gendered at all scales from everyday
life to higher order processes in society. Despite a broader view,
poverty reduction policies are (again) often directed or targeted
at women as vulnerable victims of poverty, ill-health, conflict,
and disaster or as resourceful agents providing for their fami-
lies, communities, and beyond. What is lost in that analysis is
not only the scrutiny of men and masculinity in development
but also how processes of power, dispossession, and depriva-
tion intersect with other major processes in society of great
importance for social change.
As regards women, gender, and environment, the focus on
women's work and the weight of dual or triple workloads is
now also expressed in relation to populations exposed to
global environmental change and disasters. This reflects (and
repeats) how development policy has interchangeably spo-
ken of women as a targeted group of either victims and ben-
eficiaries or agents of social change (or both) rather than of
gender as fundamental to social relations of diversity and
inequality and thus in need of further critical scrutiny
(Sultana, 2014). This is partly explained by the fact that
mainstreaming ends up diluting or distorting the radical edge
of new initiatives as seen when the emphasis on gendered
responsibilities (rather than rights) is continuously repro-
duced and reinforced not only in the development discourse
but lately also in response to climate change.
Third, on environment, knowledge has evolved from doc-
umented observations of pollution, environmental degrada-
tion, and overuse of natural resources to a deeper
understanding of the need to reverse these processes through
conservation, preservation, restrictions, and regulations while
also considering mitigation of and adaptation to climate
change. Environment has become subject to processes of mar-
ketization and the use of market-based instruments (such as
PES), which are problematic for several reasons. Not only is
the pricing and the setting of discount rates on nature includ-
ing the atmosphere and the oceans a complex process, it is also
a way to exclude social groups who have poor access to mar-
kets or who are deprived of rights to resources. In response to
climate change as well as to environmental degradation and
pollution, there is scope for synergies between poverty reduc-
tion and environmental concerns but not necessarily via com-
modification of nature because it may imply an excessive
focus on market forces in poverty reduction policies. Many
people who are poor depend for their living on natural
resources and the environment while often being disfavored
by markets (Jerneck & Olsson, 2014; Olsson & Jerneck,
2010). Even if markets can liberate some, they neglect others
such as the chronic poor who need access to social support and
social change (Hulme & Shepherd, 2003), implying a wide
range of public services constituting both the basis of and the
frame within which market incentives may play a role--but
not the only role. Given these conditions, market-based instru-
ments in the context of climate change and environment--
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Reducing emissions
from deforestation and forest degradation(REDD+), schemes
for voluntary carbon markets, and so on--are clearly problem-
atic tools in poverty reduction (Olsson et al., 2014).
Illustrating Potential Social Change
Collective action or community-based initiatives are not always
sufficient or necessary measures, and, in some instances, they
Jerneck 11
are even contested, but under certain conditions they can be
an alternative to conventional development interventions.
Collective action informed by gender has often shown to be
effective--especially when people who have lower capacity
to accumulate resources and/or limited physical mobility due
to gendered reproductive tasks are motivated to develop and
enhance their social capital by building and nurturing local-
ized networks (Agarwal, 2000). If gender-sensitive initia-
tives and environmental innovation are included, then
synergies with development may emerge.
In the context of small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan
Africa--characterized by the food imperative, the health
imperative, and the gender imperative--recent research in
sustainability science has identified and analyzed such
shared initiatives and action, be it in collective efforts to
jointly pool and use human urine as a valuable resource to
improve soil infertility (Andersson, 2015), in local organiza-
tion in communities of practice where mainly women farm-
ers get together to start saving funds and income-generating
activities in agriculture and agroforestry (Andersson &
Gabrielsson, 2012; Jerneck & Olsson, 2014), and in entre-
preneurial initiatives aiming at water harvesting (Gabrielsson
& Ramasar, 2013). Facilitation skills are important in such
research but "having the right attitude and the enthusiasm to
mobilise the local community" (Kar & Pasteur, 2005, p. 2) is
found to be the most crucial aspect.
In summary, such research gives prominence to two con-
ditions that are necessary to enable successful social change
with environmental benefits in the context of poverty and
multiple stressors: the existence of local and tangible bene-
fits from development initiatives and interventions (Jerneck
& Olsson, 2013) and the presence of entrepreneurially ori-
ented individuals who can act as catalysts for collective
action and social change (Jerneck & Olsson, 2014). Table 1
builds on research in sustainability science and represents a
typology of mobilization mechanisms for social change
where the two above-mentioned conditions helped pave the
way for transformation. The first column provides five
examples of social change initiated through a certain kind of
mobilization mechanism, indicated in the second column,
which in turn generated both direct local benefits and further
cobenefits, as seen in the third and fourth columns.
Pointing at Ways Forward
What are the ways forward when unequal power relations are
embedded and inscribed in land, water, and other natural
resources (Bryant, 1998) and gender regimes influence
access to and use of natural resources (Agarwal, 2003;
Sultana, 2014)? One option is to use a political-ecology lens
allowing a feminist epistemology and a global-to-local per-
spective (D. Rocheleau et al., 2013). That may provide an
integrated focus on how socioecological challenges, in
small-scale farming, create multiple interacting stressors for
people who are poor and depend on the environment for their
survival (Andersson, 2014; Jerneck & Olsson, 2013, 2014).
Political ecology directs attention not only to the persistent
social problems of poverty, dispossession, and unequal
resource distribution but also to the politics of environmental
degradation, social justice, and the neoliberalization of
nature (Elmhirst, 2011). In addition, feminist political ecol-
ogy goes beyond targeting and mainstreaming to consider
the gendering of decision-making processes in relation to
resource use, land titling, and tenure arrangements, and do so
with social, spatial, temporal, and (thus) intersectional
inequality in mind (Nightingale, 2011).
Development theories and practices are not only gendered
but also intertwined with other social and socioecological

processes and relations calling for intersectional perspectives
that address multiple aspects of identity. As a dynamic theory
emerging from feminist research, intersectionality may spark
further inquiry into poverty and riches in relation to the gov-
ernance of global environmental change and poverty reduc-
tion (Kaijser & Kronsell, 2014). It uses deconstructive moves
to uncover and analyze multiple intersections of power and
inequality in social relations while challenging the notion of
sameness (as in "the poor" and "women") and the notion of
difference as often used in "developed" versus "developing
countries" or in "women versus men" (Cho, Crenshaw, &
McCall, 2013). As a heuristic, its methods can be used to
increase knowledge and understandings of how power works
through time and space--via norms, scales, and structures--
to create overlaps and intersections between identity catego-
ries such as age, class, ethnicity, gender, place, race, and sex.
It may reveal not only how legal, political, spatial, or other
types of inequality or discrimination are shaped and repro-
duced but also how social and environmental justice can be
promoted in fair and gender-sensitive global environmental
governance. Given that policy intervention often goes
beyond geographical and sectorial borders to spread quickly
throughout a globalized world (Weaver, 2014), intersection-
ality could serve as an important critical lens.
Concluding Remark
The world and its problems extend across disciplinary bound-
aries and have to be understood beyond disciplinary perspec-
tives. The development field including all its varied aspects,
concepts, tools, and visions is explicitly interdisciplinary and a
clear example of how competing ideologies, theories, and prac-
tices coexist within the same and inescapably political dis-
course (Leftwich, 2005). Theory and action on development,
gender, and environment share not only the same aspiration of
profound social change but also the many continuously con-
tested political means and objectives of transformation
(Cornwall et al., 2007).Acritical scrutiny of how development,
gender, and environment are intertwined in poverty reduction
efforts, and how inequality is a matter of politics rather than of
economics and culture only, may thus contribute a better under-
standing of the dynamics of policy making and allow fairer
governance and outcomes of human­nature interactions.
