New endoscopic
classification system for
biliary stricture after liver
transplantation
Zhichu Qin* and En-Qiang Linghu*
Abstract
Aim: A new classification system for biliary stricture (BS) after liver transplantation (LT) is
proposed, aiming to standardize endoscopic treatment for this condition.
Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from patients who had undergone endoscopic
retrograde cholangiography after LT, and who provided endoscopy images clear enough to reveal
the biliary system. Images were classified separately by two endoscopists, who discussed and
resolved any disputed findings. From these images, a new classification system is proposed (Ling
classification): type A, normal biliary structure; type B, anastomotic stricture and normal
intrahepatic biliary structure; type C, narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary structure or beaded
intrahepatic biliary structure or intrahepatic biliary cast without anastomotic stricture; type D,
narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary structure or beaded intrahepatic biliary structure or
intrahepatic biliary cast with anastomotic stricture.
Results: Analysis involved 93 patients: 76 men and 17 women, median age 54 years (range, 12­69
years). Type B was the most commonly observed BS after LT, accounting for 44 cases (47.3%). Type
A, the least commonly observed type, accounted for nine (9.7%), type C for 22 (23.7%) and type D
for 18 (19.3%) cases.
Conclusion: A new endoscopic classification system for BS after LT is proposed, to help
determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with each type of stricture.

Introduction
Surgical techniques, methods of graft pres-
ervation and immunosuppressive drugs for
liver transplantation (LT) have improved
steadily over the years, but the rate of biliary
stricture (BS) remains at 16.2­35.6% for
living donor liver transplants,1­5 due to the
nature of the surgery and possible postsur-
gical complications. Treatment for BS has
evolved, with the development of less inva-
sive techniques including endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography and
transhepatic percutaneous drainage.6­8 Use
of the transhepatic percutaneous approach
is inconvenient for patients, requiring them
to maintain percutaneous drainage tubes for
several months.9 Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiography (ERC) is considered diag-
nostic for BS after LT, with therapeutic
endoscopy and radiological techniques
replacing surgery in the majority of cases
as first line therapy, with high success
rates.10­13 Until now there has been no
standard endoscopic classification for BS
after LT.
The purpose of the present study was to
develop a classification system for BS on the
basis of endoscopic pictures after LT, and to
use this system to establish an appropriate
management strategy for patients. The pro-
posed classification system is named the
Ling classification because Ling is short for
Linghu, the family name of the correspond-
ing author.
Patients and methods
This retrospective study analysed the endo-
scopic examinations of patients with jaun-
dice who had undergone cadaveric or living
donor liver transplantation at the
Department of Gastroenterology, People's
Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing,
China between May 2006 and September
2011. Two endoscopists (E-Q.L. and Z.Q.)
independently recorded the characteristics
of intrahepatic biliary and anastomotic
stricture, and classified patients into four
groups according to their findings: type A,
normal biliary structure; type B, anasto-
motic stricture and normal intrahepatic bil-
iary structure; type C, narrow and stiff
intrahepatic biliary structure or beaded
intrahepatic biliary structure or intrahepatic
biliary cast without anastomotic stricture;
type D, narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary
structure or beaded intrahepatic biliary
structure or intrahepatic biliary cast with
anastomotic stricture.
Results
In total, there were 93 patients (76 men and
17 women) for whom clear pictures of ERC
were available: 15 (16.1%) had undergone
living donor liver transplantation; 78
(83.9%) had received cadaver organs. The
median age of patients was 54 years (range,
12­69 years).
The proportion of each Ling subtype in
the included cases is shown in Table 1;
typical images obtained for each subtype
are shown in Figures 1­5.
Of the nine patients classified as Ling A,
two had repeated episodes of jaundice with
normal ERC results. Their symptoms were
alleviated with endoscopic nosalbiliary
drainage. The remaining seven patients
were treated medically with ursodeoxycholic
acid capsules 250 mg, orally, twice daily for
1 month. The 44 patients classified as Ling B
were treated with balloon dilatation, stent
drainage, external drainage of the bile duct
or transhepatic percutaneous drainage. In
40 patients classified as Ling B, endoscopic
treatment was successful. One patient from
this group developed a severe infection
postoperatively and died of multiple organ
failure; a further three patients with repeated
severe jaundice were treated either surgically
to repair the stricture or with biliary­enteric
anastomosis, and these measures relieved
the symptoms. There were 22 patients clas-
sified as Ling C, all of whom were treated

with endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage
(ERBD) and cleaning with `bolt-shaped'
material. Eighteen patients were treated
successfully, two patients died of multiple
organ failure and two patients required a
second liver transplant, after which their
symptoms were alleviated. Of the 18 patients
classified as Ling D, all were treated
with ERBD and cleaning with `bolt-
shaped' material. This procedure success-
fully mitigated symptoms in 13 patients; one
patient had lung metastases and died of
respiratory failure, two patients were
treated with biliary­enteric anastomosis
and two patients required a second liver
transplant.

Discussion
Biliary complications are a frequent cause of
morbidity and mortality after LT, occurring
in between 5.8 and 39.5% of reported
cases.6­8,14­18 The most frequent biliary
complications are BS, which affect 16.2­
35.6% of patients,1­5 and are classified
as anastomotic or nonanastomotic.8,19
Strictures restricted to the anastomotic site
are likely to be related to problems encoun-
tered during surgery and the type of biliary
reconstruction; they are isolated and short,
with a reported incidence of 4­9%.20
Nonanastomotic strictures generally occur
in groups, are longer than anastomotic
strictures, are located in either the intrahe-
patic and/or donor duct proximal to the
anastomotic site and have an incidence of
5­15%.21 Nonanastomotic strictures result
primarily from hepatic artery thrombosis.22

Identified causes include chronic ductopenic
rejection, ABO incompatibility, ischaemia/
reperfusion injury or recurrence of primary
diseases such as primary sclerosing cholan-
gitis or autoimmune hepatitis.22
Biliary strictures can be treated by one or
more interventions, including endoscopic
transpapillary cholangiography, transhepa-
tic percutaneous cholangiography or trans-
hepatic percutaneous drainage, and/or
surgical approaches.23,24 Endoscopic retro-
grade cholangiography is generally the first-
line therapy for BS after LT and has a
success rate of between 36.9 and 68%.10­13
However, treatment varies, depending on
the features of the BS, hence the need for a
standard and clear classification system, for
which the Ling classification is proposed.
In our study, type B was the most com-
monly observed BS after LT, accounting for
44 cases (47.3%), and type A was the least
commonly observed, accounting for just
nine cases (9.7%) of cases. In our experi-
ence, patients with type A BS will have
symptomatic remission treated with drain-
age and medical therapy: their jaundice may
be caused by a graft rejection reaction.
Conversely, patients with type A BS were
almost all treated by endoscopic transpapil-
lary cholangiography or transhepatic percu-
taneous cholangiography, including balloon
dilatation and stent drainage. No patients in
the present study displayed a type B stricture
and retained normal liver function. For
patients with type C or D BS, endoscopy
treatment was initially most useful,l but
surgical repair and retransplantation were
necessary for those who needed further
endoscopic treatments or who failed endo-
scopic treatment. Although type C and D BS
underwent the same treatment strategies,
they were separated into two classifications
because of anatomical differences in their
appearance.
The authors acknowledge there were a
number of limitations to the present study,
such as the small sample size and the lack of
long-term follow-up. Thus, further pro-
spective studies are needed, to determine
the validity of the proposed Ling classifica-
tion system for selecting candidates for
appropriate treatment.
In conclusion, we hope that the Ling
classification might help in determining the
appropriate treatment strategy for patients
with BS after LT. Further prospective
studies are needed to determine the useful-
ness of the Ling classification system.
