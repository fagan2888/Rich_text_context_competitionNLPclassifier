Jian Jiao1, Yu Fan2 and Yan Zhang3
Abstract
Objective: To measure levels of microRNA (miR)-21 and its target gene, programmed cell death 4
(PDCD4), in samples of human cutaneous malignant melanoma and normal non-malignant control
skin.
Methods: Relative levels of miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA were measured using a quantitative real-
time reverse transcription­polymerase chain reaction. Correlations between the levels of the two
molecules and the clinicopathological characteristics of malignant melanoma were analysed.
Results: A total of 67 cases of human cutaneous malignant melanoma were analysed and
compared with 67 samples of normal nonmalignant control skin. Compared with normal skin
samples, the relative level of miR-21 was significantly higher and the relative level of PDCD4 mRNA
was significantly lower in the melanoma specimens. A significant negative correlation between
PDCD4 mRNA and miR-21 was demonstrated in malignant melanoma (r ¼ À0.602). Elevated miR-
21 and reduced PDCD4 mRNA levels were both significantly correlated with increased tumour
size, a higher Clark classification level and the presence of lymph node metastases in malignant
melanoma.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that miR-21 and PDCD4 might be potential biomarkers for
malignant melanoma and might provide treatment targets in the future.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma, a tumour derived
from naevus cells and melanocytes, has a
rapidly increasing incidence and is the
leading cause of skin cancer deaths, world-
wide.1 The main reasons for the poor prog-
nosis and high mortality rate associated with
malignant melanoma include the diagnosis
of late-stage melanoma, its early metastasis
via blood vessels and lymph nodes and
resistance to chemotherapy.2,3 There is an
urgent need to determine the detailed cellu-
lar and molecular mechanisms underlying
the development and progression of this
disease, which are complex and remain
poorly understood.
MicroRNAs (miRs) belong to a class of
small, highly conserved noncoding RNAs
(14­24 nucleotides) that are widely present
in mammalian genomes, which can regulate
gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level by the degradation of target mRNA or
the inhibition of mRNA translation.4
Studies reveal that several miRs play
important roles in the tumourigenesis,
progression and metastasis of malignant
melanoma, such as miR-137, miR-101, let-
7, miR-26a, miR-221/222, miR-155, miR-
21, miR-182, miR-30b/30d, and miR-214.5
The overexpression of miR-21 has already
been shown to be associated with progres-
sion, metastasis and poor prognosis in a
variety of cancers, such as colon cancer,
pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer.6­8
Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a
tumour suppressor gene, has been shown to
be downregulated or absent in different
human cancers and this downregulation
has been associated with a poor cancer
outcome.9,10 Through the regulation of
p21, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, ornithine
decarboxylase, carbonic anhydrase II, uro-
kinase receptor and JNK/c-Jun/AP-1,
PDCD4 performs many functions in neo-
plastic transformation, apoptotic regula-
tion, and invasion.11 Recent studies have
shown that PDCD4 is the downstream
target gene of miR-21 in colon cancer,
gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcin-
oma.6,12,13 However, a possible relationship
between miR-21 and PDCD4 remains to be
investigated in malignant melanoma.
The aim of the present study was to
measure miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA levels
in human cutaneous malignant melanoma
tissues, and to analyse the association
between their levels and clinicopathological
characteristics of malignant melanoma.
Patients and methods
Patients and tissue samples
Paraffin wax-embedded malignant melanoma
tissue specimens were sequentially collected
from patients with malignant melanoma by
the Department of Dermatology, Qilu
Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan,
China, the Department of Pathology,
Medical School, Shandong University,
Jinan, China, the Department of
Dermatology, The Traditional Chinese
Medicine Hospital of Jinan City, Jinan,
China and the Department of Dermatology,
Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, China
between January 2010 and December 2012.
Paired nonmalignant normal control skin
specimens were sequentially collected from
healthy volunteers from the Department of
Plastic Surgery, Qilu Hospital, Shandong
University, Jinan, China. Sex and age were
matched between patients and healthy con-
trol subjects between January 2010 and
December 2012. The location and size of the
tumour and the presence of lymph node
metastases were recorded for every patient
with malignant melanoma. Tissue sections
derived from the specimens were routinely
stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and
were reviewed by two pathologists to assess
the Clark classification.14 Patients diagnosed
with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma
who had not undergone chemotherapy,
radiotherapy or surgical treatment were

included into this study. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients and
healthy control subjects. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Qilu
Hospital (reference number: QL2009079).
Extraction of total RNA and miRNA
Paraffin wax surrounding the tissue samples
was removed and serial sections (10mm) were
cut from the block specimens. Four sections
were loaded into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge
(BT620-NS; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,
China) and 1 ml xylene was added to the
sample. The sample was vortexed vigorously
for 10 s and then centrifuged at 13 400 g for
2 min at room temperature. The supernatant
was discarded and 1 ml 100% ethanol was
added to the pellet, which was centrifuged
at 13 400 g for 2 min at room temperature.
The supernatant was discarded and the
pellet was air dried at room temperature.
Subsequent extraction procedures were
undertaken according to the manufacturer's
instructions for the total RNA extraction kit
and the microRNA rapid extraction kit
(BioTeke, Beijing, China). An ultraviolet
spectrophotometer (SMA4000; Merinton,
Beijing, China) was used to detect the
purity and concentration of total RNA.
Measurement of miR-21 and PDCD4
mRNA using qRT­PCR
Real-time quantitative reverse transcrip-
tion­polymerase chain reaction (qRT­
PCR) for miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA was
performed on cDNA generated from the
above total RNA according to the manu-
facturer's instructions described below,
using U6 noncoding small nuclear RNA
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) as the internal controls,
respectively. Primer sequences were
designed as follows (Sangon Biotech):
miR-21 forward 50-GAAATGCCTCAC
AGCTATCGT-30 and reverse 50-CCTC
CACAAAGAGCCACC-30; U6 forward
50-ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACA-30

reverse 50- AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGT
GAAGAC-30. The RT reaction system
(20 ml; All-in-one First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit; FulenGen, Guangzhou,
China) contained 5 ml RNA, 0.4 ml 10 mM
dNTP, 0.8 ml N6 random primer, 4 ml
5 Â Reverse buffer, 0.3 ml Moloney murine
leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase, 0.4 ml
RNasin and 9.1 ml diethylpyrocarbonate
water. The reaction conditions were as
follows: 37C for 60 min and 94C for
3 min. After the RT reaction, qRT­PCR
reaction was performed as follows using an
ABI7500 real-time PCR detection system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The qRT­PCR reaction system
(20 ml) contained 2.0 ml cDNA, 10 ml
2 Â SYBR Premix ExTaqTM II (TaKaRa
Biotechnology, Shiga, Japan), 1.6 ml of the
specific primers, 0.4 ml 50 Â ROX Reference
Dye (TaKaRa Biotechnology) with add-
itional triple-distilled water up to a final
volume of 20 ml. The PCR cycling conditions
comprised of preliminary denaturation at
95C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95C for 5 s, annealing and
elongation at 60C for 34 s, and then a
dissociation stage at 60C for 15 s. Each
sample was measured in triplicate and the
amount of miR21 and PDCD4 mRNA
relative to the internal controls were deter-
mined using the 2ÀÁÁC

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 17.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Relative levels of miR-21and
PDCD4 mRNA are presented as
mean Æ SD. The difference between the two
groups was analysed using Student's t-test.
The correlation between the relative levels of
miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA was assessed
using Spearman's rank correlation coeffi-
cient analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to
assess the correlation between the relative
levels of miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA and
the clinicopathological characteristics of
malignant melanoma. A P-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
This study used 67 malignant melanoma
tissue specimens from 43 male and 24 female
patients (median age, 50.7 years [range
40­73 years]) and 67 paired nonmalignant
normal control skin specimens. Among the
67 malignant melanoma specimens, 59 speci-
mens were from the limbs, six from the face
an two from the chest. The mean Æ SD
relative level of miR-21 was significantly
higher in malignant melanoma specimens
compared with control samples (9.853Æ
3.136 versus 1.107 Æ 0.113, respectively;
P < 0.05) (Figure 1). The meanÆ SD relative
level of PDCD4 mRNA was significantly
lower in malignant melanoma specimens
compared with control samples (1.385Æ
0.429 versus 9.341 Æ 1.252, respectively;
P < 0.05) (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 3,
there was a significant negative correlation
between the relative levels of miR-21 and
PDCD4 mRNA in malignant melanoma
tissues, as shown by Spearman's rank correl-
ation coefficient analysis (r ¼ À0.602,
P < 0.05).
As shown in Table 1, an elevated miR-21
relative level and reduced PDCD4 mRNA
relative level were both significantly corre-
lated with an increased tumour size, a higher
Clark classification level and the presence of

Discussion
Similar to most other tumour types, the
genesis, progression and invasion of malig-
nant melanoma is a complex biological
process that involves the abnormal regula-
tion of multiple genes.15 MiRNAs play
important functions in cell differentiation,
cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and
immune regulation by promoting the deg-
radation of their target mRNA or inhibiting
mRNA translation.16 Upregulated miRNA
levels, for example miR-182 and miR-149,
and downregulated levels of miRNAs, for
example miR-26a and miR-101, have been
shown to be involved in the development and
progression of malignant melanoma.5,17
Overexpression of miR-21 is associated
with the progression, metastasis and poor
prognosis of many types of tumours via its
regulation of the phosphatase and tensin
homologue (PTEN), the tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 3 and PDCD4 genes.6­8
A study of 127 primary melanoma tissues
demonstrated that levels of miR-21 were
significantly increased compared with
benign naevi.18 Increased expression of
miR-21 was also demonstrated in 86 pri-
mary cutaneous melanomas and expression
levels were correlated with Breslow thick-
ness and advanced clinical stage.19 This
present study showed that consistent with
previous studies,19,20 the upregulation of

miR-21 in malignant melanoma was corre-
lated with clinicopathological characteristics
such as an increased tumour size, a higher
Clark classification level and the presence of
lymph node metastases.
At present, searching for the downstream
target genes of miR-21 and clarifying the
regulating mechanisms have become
important areas of research in malignant
melanoma. PDCD4, a tumour suppressor
gene, plays multiple important roles in
transformation, tumourigenesis, progres-
sion and invasion.11 The downregulation
of PDCD4 was associated with tumour
stage, nodal metastasis, and with both vas-
cular and perineural invasion in oesopha-
geal cancer.10 This present study showed
that the levels of PDCD4 mRNA were
significantly lower in malignant melanoma
specimens than in normal control skin sam-
ples. The downregulation of PDCD4
mRNA in malignant melanoma was also
correlated with clinicopathological charac-
teristics such as an increased tumour size, a
higher Clark classification level and the
presence of lymph node metastases in the
present study. Research has demonstrated
that the PDCD4 gene is a direct downstream
target for miR-21.20 Overexpression of miR-
21 regulated the metastatic behaviour of B16
melanoma cells by inhibiting PDCD4,
PTEN and B-cell translocation gene 2.20
This present study also found a negative
correlation between PDCD4 mRNA and
miR-21 in malignant melanoma tissue,
which suggests that the miR-21-modulated
downregulation of the PDCD4 gene might
be a crucial oncogenic mechanism in malig-
nant melanoma. To our knowledge, this is
the first published article demonstrating a
correlation between PDCD4 mRNA and
miR-21 in malignant melanoma tissue.
This present study was limited by the fact
that it simply measured the levels of miR-21
and PDCD4 mRNA in malignant melan-
oma specimens compared with normal non-
malignant control skin. Further research is
required to provide a detailed understanding
of the molecular mechanisms responsible for
the association between PDCD4 mRNA
and miR-21in malignant melanoma tissue.
In conclusion, elevated miR-21 and
reduced PDCD4 mRNA levels, which were
negatively correlated with each other, were
associated with clinicopathological charac-
teristics in malignant melanoma. These
findings suggest that miR-21 and PDCD4
mRNA levels might be potential biomarkers
for malignant melanoma, and might provide
treatment targets in the future.
