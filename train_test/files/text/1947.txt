The physiological benefits of vigorous exercise are
well established. The existence of psychological
benefits is less clear, however, due to methodological
limitations common to investigatory studies. Two of
these limitations are the difficulty of establishing
appropriate control groups and the large variety of
highly specific measures of psychological function
available for consideration of effects. To address
these limitations, we identified 63 pairs of mono-
zygotic twins from the National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States who were discor-
dant for the amount of vigorous exercise in which they
engaged regularly. The twins who regularly engaged in
vigorous exercise experienced greater positive psycho-
logical functioning than their nonexercising co-twins as
measured by the latent factor representing the vari-
ance common to 8 measures of mood, optimism,
control over life, and interpersonal aspects of personal-
ity. The magnitude of the difference was in excess of
.4 standard deviations.
The physiological benefits of exercise for purposes of
both prevention and rehabilitation of chronic disease
are well established (Fletcher et al., 1992; Haskell,
1984). At the popular level, exercise is strongly asso-
ciated with positive psychological functioning as well.
In spite of this, most people (perhaps 70%) in devel-
oped, western populations do not engage in regular
vigorous exercise (Brawley & Rodgers, 1994;
Hamdorf et al., 2002), and attrition rates in exercise
programs are high (Raglin, 2001). For example, the
authors of one study of an effective behavioral inter-
vention in exercise program adherence were pleased
to report reduction of 6-month drop-out rates from
63% to 39% (Annesi & Unruh, 2004). This suggests
that adherence may be driven by psychological bene-
fits that are not experienced to the same degree by all
participants. For example, there is evidence that
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype may
be associated with endurance performance and adher-
ence to exercise programs even in the absence of
differences in baseline levels and changes in physio-
logical measures in response to exercise (Thompson
et al., 2006). Understanding why and the extent to
which there may be individual differences of this kind
that contribute to exercise adherence is important in
aging populations, given the substantial evidence for
the importance of regular exercise in maintaining
physical health. Moreover, there is growing evidence
that links among cognitive decline, depression symp-
tomatology, and deteriorating physical health in the
elderly may be reversed or slowed by physical exercise
(Colcombe et al., 2006; Dishman et al., 2006).
Indeed, it is challenging to summarize research
findings in this area succinctly. There are many
reasons for this, but they can be grouped along two
lines. First, psychological benefits can be measured in
various ways, and results tend to differ depending on
the specific measure of positive psychological func-
tioning used, the nature of the exercise engaged in,
and the degree to which this level of exercise is habit-
ual to the study participants. For example, findings of
increases in positive mood are clearest when regular
exercisers undertake vigorous exercise at a level with
which they are familiar (Salmon, 2001). In contrast,
strenuous exercise in sedentary people has generally
been associated with increased negative mood or
decreased positive mood (Petruzello et al., 1997).
Perhaps because of this, findings of increases in
positive mood tend to be clearer and stronger than
findings of decreases in negative mood (McIntyre et
al., 1990; Steptoe et al., 1993). In addition, clinical
samples may not yield the same results as community-
based samples. For example, assessment of effects of
exercise on psychopathological symptomatology in
community samples is subject to floor effects when
the sample has too little symptomatology to show
improvement with exercise (Salmon, 2001). And
studies of stress resistance show varying results
depending on the nature and timing of the induced

stressor and the specific measure of response to stress
used (Salmon, 2001). For example, there is evidence
that, during exercise, cardiovascular responses to
mental stress increase (Rouselle et al., 1995), though
emotional responses to mental stress decrease (Girodo
& Pellegrini, 1976).
The variation in results and its diverse sources
suggest that an approach to the measurement of posi-
tive psychological functioning that can summarize
positive psychological functioning may help to clarify
the nature and extent of its association with exercise.
We employed such a measure in this study, making use
of a latent variable tapping the variance common to
eight measures of positive psychological functioning.
Latent variables have substantial advantages in mea-
surement of psychological constructs. They represent
the systematic confluence of measured variables; as
such, they represent unidimensional constructs in their
purest form (Bollen, 1989). The observed variables
serving as indicators of a latent variable all contain
random and/or systematic measurement error, but the
latent variable is free of this.
The second group of reasons for complexity in
results of studies investigating the psychological effects
of exercise involves the possibility of self-selection.
Broadly stated, the effect of exercise on psychological
functioning may not be causal. Rather, to the extent
that exercise appears to confer psychological benefits,
it is possible that some unmeasured constitutional or
environmental variable distinguishes the people who
exercise from those who do not in that the exercisers
respond to the world in general -- and to exercise in
particular -- more positively than the nonexercisers.
More specifically, it is possible that people who
choose to exercise vigorously and regularly tend to
enjoy it, and everything else, more than those who do
not choose to exercise. Perhaps they also experience
more positive and less negative mood, less depression
and anxiety, greater control over their lives, higher
self-concept, and/or greater resistance to stress than
those who resist exercising (Salmon, 2001).
It is of course not possible to measure exhaustively
every variable that could exert such a causative influ-
ence. Studies of monozygotic (MZ) twins reared
together in childhood but discordant for level of exer-
cise in adulthood, however, can usefully minimize,
though not completely eliminate, such possible effects.
This is because such MZ twins are matched on genetic
and childhood environmental background, and thus
the nonexercising twins serve as controls for these
kinds of variables in relation to their exercising co-
twins. There is evidence that this is relevant: there
appear to be both general familial and genetic influ-
ences on both the tendency to exercise (e.g., Perusse et
al., 2003; Simonen et al., 2002) and the physiological
response to exercise (Kartodihardjo & Klissouras,
1976). MZ twins are also the same gender, which
means that whatever effects of sex may be present are
also controlled. The use of this design makes it more
likely that any differences between exercising and
nonexercising MZ co-twins in psychological measures
can be attributed to the amount of exercise they get.
We made use of such a sample of discordant MZ twin
pairs in this study. Thus, the purpose of this study was
to investigate the existence and magnitude of psycho-
logical benefits of habitual vigorous exercise,
compensating for the limitations of previous studies
by using a latent summary variable of positive psycho-
logical functioning in a sample of MZ twin pairs
discordant for level of exercise.
Participants and Measures
The MZ twin pairs discordant for level of exercise in
this study came from the MacArthur Foundation
Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS). The base sample consists of 998 twin pairs
distributed roughly according to population through-
out the continental United States and ranging in age
from 25 to 74 (M = 44.9, SD = 12.1). In total, the
sample includes 172 MZ male pairs, 195 MZ female
pairs, 138 dizygotic (DZ) male pairs, 214 DZ female
pairs, 262 opposite-sex pairs, and 17 pairs with
missing or indeterminate zygosity information. The
sample is 58% female; about 92% listed their race as
Caucasian. Additional description of the sample and
its recruitment is given in Johnson and Krueger (2004)
and Kessler et al. (2004).
The MIDUS participants completed a series of self-
report questionnaires including questions on health,
lifestyle, and psychological functioning. Level of exer-
cise was assessed in two questions (one for each
season), `During the summer/winter, how often do you
engage in vigorous physical activity (e.g., running or
lifting heavy objects) long enough to work up a
sweat?'. Response choices were `several times a week
or more', `about once a week', `several times a
month', `about once a month', `less than once a
month', and `never'. The responses to each question
were coded so that they represented estimated
numbers of exercise sessions per month: `several times
a week or more' was coded as 13.5, `about once a
week' was coded as 4.5, `several times a month' was
coded as 3, and so forth. The estimates for the two
questions were averaged. The resulting variable had a
mean of 6.2, a median of 4.5, a mode of 13.5, and a
standard deviation of 5.1. Overall, the sample
members may have exercised slightly more than
average, as only 55% said they exercised once a week
or less. Still, only 26% said they exercised three times
a week or more and 25% said they exercised about
once a month or less. Because the variable was signifi-
cantly correlated with age (­.18, p < .001) and
because MZ twins share a common age and gender
which can inflate their apparent similarity, we
regressed the effects of age and gender from the exer-
cise variable using the data from the full sample.
There were no significant main effects of gender.

The distribution of the resulting variable is shown
in Figure 1. As the figure makes clear, the distribution
was bi- or perhaps tri-modal. Most participants fell in
the lower or upper ranges of the distribution. We
made use of this in order to select MZ pairs function-
ally discordant for level of exercise by requiring that
one member of each pair score below ­.42 (in the
bottom 47% of the distribution), while the other
scored above .87 (in the top 28.5% of the distribu-
tion). This meant, roughly, that those we classed as
nonexercisers exercised at most three times per month,
while those we classed as exercisers exercised at least
three times per week. There were 63 (34 male, 29
female) MZ twin pairs who met this discordance crite-
rion (age range 25­73, M = 44.7, SD = 12.1).
To measure psychological function, we made use
of eight variables, adjusted to remove the effects of
age and gender. We purposely selected trait measures
of positive personality functioning that have shown
substantial genetic influence (Bouchard & Loehlin,
2001), as well as measures of positive attitude and
mood that are more state-like in nature, because we
were interested in constructing a latent variable that
could transcend the questions raised by the existing
literature regarding timing and continuity of effects. In
addition, we wanted to include variables that show
substantial genetic influence. Variables with substan-
tial genetic influences should show substantial
similarity in MZ twins, thus creating a base of similar-
ity between MZ co-twins that should sharpen the
effects of nonshared environmental influences relevant
to the pairs' discordance for exercise, thus making
stronger our test for such effects.
Participants quantified their experience of good
mood by rating how much of the time in the past
month they felt six forms of positive emotion (e.g.,
`cheerful' and `full of life') on a 5-point scale ranging
from `all the time' to `none of the time'. Full-sample
alpha for this scale was .91. Participants also indicated
the extent to which the adjective `optimistic' described
them on a scale of 1 to 4 and rated their expected sat-
isfaction with their lives 10 years in the future on a
scale of 1 to 10. We combined standardized scores on
these two items to form a scale we called Optimism
(alpha = .41). The MIDUS questionnaires also
included questions about the degree to which partici-
pants perceived they had control over various aspects
of their lives, assessed on a scale from 1 to 10. The
questions read, `How would you rate the amount of
control you have over your __ these days?' and life
aspects queried were health, work situation, financial
situation, contribution to the welfare and well-being
of other people, overall relationship with children,
marriage or close relationship, sexual aspect, and life
overall. Full-sample alpha for the scale formed from
the mean response to these ratings was .73.
Participants who did not have spouses, close relation-
ships, or children and thus did not respond to these
items received scores based on the mean of the items
to which they did respond.
The remaining five variables we used assessed per-
sonality based on the Big Five Model (Extraversion,

Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and
Neuroticism; Lachman & Weaver, 1997), with the
addition of a scale for Agency, a construct reflecting
self-confidence and assertiveness. Each scale consisted
of 4 to 7 adjectives chosen from existing trait lists and
inventories (e.g., Goldberg, 1992; John, 1990;
Trapnell & Wiggins, 1990). Alphas for the scales in
the pilot study used to develop them were .74, .78,
.80, .58, .77, and .79 for Neuroticism, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and
Agency respectively). For this study, because we were
focusing on positive psychological functioning, we
did not include the Neuroticism variable. There were
no mean or variance differences between MZ twin
pairs discordant for exercise and the rest of the
MIDUS twin sample on any of the eight measures of
psychological function.
Analysis and Results
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for
the eight measures of psychological functioning in
exercisers and nonexercisers. As expected, with only
one exception, exercisers showed more positive
psychological functioning. Consistent with many
results of studies of psychological benefits of exer-
cise, however, the benefits did not appear to be
consistent or clear-cut. Paired-sample t tests showed
at least marginally significant differences in five vari-
ables, but only two were significant (p < .05) after
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Stated so
that positive statistics favor exercisers, effect sizes of
differences ranged from ­.05 (ns) for Optimism to
.44 (p = .002) for Openness. The eight variables
shared substantial common variance however, as sug-
gested by the correlations among them shown in
Table 2. In the full sample, factor analysis indicated
that the first factor, with an eigenvalue of 3.33,
explained 42% of the variance. The lowest loading
on this factor was .44 from Conscientiousness. (By
way of comparison, the second factor, with an eigen-
value of 1.09, explained an additional 14% of the
variance, and there were no additional factors with
eigenvalues greater than 1.00. In a two-factor solu-
tion, the factors were correlated .61.)
We used this single dominant common factor to
construct a two-group (exercising MZ twins and
nonexercising MZ twins) latent factor model with a

mean structure. In doing so, we thought of our vari-
ables as reflecting different aspects of positive
psychological functioning. In this conceptualization, it
is the variance common to them all that captures the
construct we believe to be important in the association
between exercise and positive psychological function-
ing. That is, it is not, for example, extraversion per se
that is associated with exercise. Rather, it is the sur-
gency of positive mood and active engagement in life
that often drive the overt sociability that our extraver-
sion measure taps that is associated with exercise, and
analogous statements can be made for all the eight
variables that make up our latent variable.
A factor model of this kind allows for the calcula-
tion of model parameters in each group. We set one
factor loading in the first group to 1.00 and the factor
variances equal to identify the model. To establish that
measurement of the involved constructs is consistent
from group to group and thus that any observed dif-
ference in the latent factor means actually indicates a
group difference, it is necessary that it be possible to
constrain factor loadings, intercepts, and residual vari-
ances equal across groups without significant loss of
model fit (Meredith, 1993). It was possible to do so in
this case (2 = 8.4 on 23 df, p = .99). The model
parameter estimates are shown in Table 3. The table
shows that each measure of psychological functioning
had substantial loadings on the general factor. The
latent factor mean for the exercising group was set at
0 in establishing the model; that for the nonexercising
group was freely estimated at ­.31. This difference
was significant (p = .03, two-tailed). The factor vari-
ance for each group was .51, indicating that the latent
variable had about half as much variance as the eight
standardized variables underlying it. This factor
variance meant that the mean difference had an effect
size of .43 (.31/square root of .51).
We carried out several tests of the consistency of
the latent factor mean difference in psychological
functioning we observed between exercisers and
nonexercisers. First, we wanted to establish that the
difference we observed in the sample of discordant
twins was not the result of some odd combination of
circumstances in an unusual group of twins. The
remainder of our sample consisted of both MZ and
DZ twins who were not discordant for level of exer-
cise. A median split on the exercise variable in this
group (without regard to pair status) produced a
latent factor mean difference with an effect size of .37
(p = .01, two-tailed), indicating a very similar effect in
exercisers and nonexercisers without co-twin control.
Second, we wanted some evidence that it was the dis-
cordance for level of exercise rather than some
difference related to the assignment of twin numbers
or simply the separation of pairs that drove the latent
mean difference in psychological functioning. The
latent mean difference in MZ twins concordant for
level of exercise had an effect size of ­.09, which was
not significant (p = .49, two-tailed). Third, we wanted
to demonstrate that the effect held in the full sample
of MZ twins, whether or not they met our definition
of discordance for level of exercise. In the full sample
of MZ twins, the correlation between the pair differ-
ence in level of exercise and the pair difference in
psychological function latent variable factor scores
was .21 (p < .001), indicating that the effect did hold
throughout the sample of MZ twins.
Finally, though our data were contemporaneous,
making inference of causal attribution impossible, we
tabulated some data related to the direction of effect.
More substantive differences in psychological func-
tioning between twins discordant for exercise than
differences in exercising between twins discordant for
positive psychological functioning would suggest that
exercise drives the improvement in psychological func-
tioning rather than vice versa. To evaluate this, we
used the mean differences in positive psychological
functioning between exercisers and nonexercisers as
boundaries to identify MZ twins discordant for posi-
tive psychological functioning. This yielded 58 pairs in
which one member of the pair scored above the mean
on positive psychological functioning for exercising
twins in the group discordant for exercising, and the
other member of the paired scored below the mean for
nonexercising twins. This formed a group of twins dis-
cordant for level of psychological functioning; they
had a mean difference with an effect size of .47. The
lower functioning group reported exercising on
average five times per month and the higher function-
ing group reported exercising on average seven times
per month. Given the categories into which our data
had been separated, this meant that distinction
between the groups was only possible because we had

averaged over the summer and winter reports. Thus,
an MZ twin difference in psychological functioning
comparable to that for exercise yielded little difference
in level of exercise, hinting that the preponderant
direction of effect is from exercise to positive psycho-
logical functioning. Corroborating this, only nine
pairs, or about 15%, were members of both the group
discordant for exercise and the group discordant for
level of psychological functioning.
The association between exercise and positive psy-
chological functioning could also result from selection
effects: there may be genetic influences common to
both positive psychological functioning and involve-
ment in exercise. To test this, we made use of the
co-twin control method. In this analysis, the discor-
dant twins served as quasi-experimental controls for
each other in comparing mean levels of positive psy-
chological functioning by level of exercise. Greater
association between level of exercise and positive
psychological functioning in DZs than in MZs, as
measured by a significant interaction term involving
zygosity and level of exercise, would provide evidence
for genetic influences common to both positive psy-
chological functioning and involvement in exercise.
The interaction term, however, was not significant
(p = .51).
Discussion
This study made use of a sample of MZ twin pairs dis-
cordant for level of vigorous exercise to investigate the
psychological benefits associated with regular exercise.
Because prior investigations of such benefits have pro-
duced results that have varied from study to study
with the specific measures of psychological function-
ing used, we made use of a latent variable reflecting
the variance common to eight measures of psychologi-
cal functioning. As has been the case in prior studies,
exercise was not associated with better functioning on
all of our individual measures. The latent variable,
however, did show a significant mean difference
between the two groups, with an effect size in excess
of .4. This finding is important in developing an
understanding of the ways that regular exercise con-
tributes to maintenance of physical health. This may
be especially true in aging populations, as exercise
may reduce the rate of physical deterioration with age,
and thus vulnerability to both mental and physical
age-related diseases.
Evidence for the specific mechanisms linking brain
and body is just now emerging. For example, it is
becoming clear that the presence of depressive symp-
toms (or the absence of the kind of positive
psychological functioning we measured in this study)
contributes to the development of excessive inflamma-
tion or immune response, which in turn can contribute
to the development of cardiac and autoimmune dis-
eases (Miller & Blackwell, 2007). Moreover,
depressive symptoms precede the development of
Alzheimer's disease, although it is not known whether
such symptoms are an early manifestation of the
disease, or play some causal role in the development
of the disease. The relations between brain and body
may be particularly important in aging groups, as all
of the body's systems become less resilient with age.
To the extent that exercise helps to maintain physical
and/or psychological resilience, it may be particularly
helpful in maintaining overall quality of life at older
ages. These are questions for future research.
Addressing these questions using longitudinal studies
that allow the observation of how the importance of
exercise in maintaining physical and psychological
health and the links between them change with age
will clearly be important.
Although our study did have an important finding
that generates important questions for future research,
it is also subject to some limitations. First, although
national in scope, our sample is somewhat wealthier,
better educated, Caucasian, and female than the
United States as a whole. This makes generalization of
our results to the full population of the United States
difficult and makes inferences about the applicability
of the psychological benefits of exercise that we
observed to populations in other parts of the world
tenuous. Second, the measures we used were all
derived from self-report in a survey questionnaire
format, a rather weak way of measuring exercise in
particular. We have no way of knowing, for example,
the actual intensity of exercise engaged in by partici-
pants who reported that they exercised vigorously, or
whether these participants experienced measurable
improvements in physical fitness. In addition, it is pos-
sible that, because they believed that exercise should
make them feel better, our exercising participants
reported that it did. Because we thought this might
affect perceptions of life satisfaction most directly, we
avoided such measures in our construct of positive
psychological functioning.
Third, our data are contemporaneous rather than
predictive, making it impossible to draw inferences
about the causal nature of the associations we have
observed. That is, it remains possible that those with
higher positive psychological functioning were more
likely to engage in vigorous exercise, while those with
lower positive psychological functioning shied away
from exercise. This would be an example of the well-
known epidemiological `healthy worker effect' (Li &
Sung, 1999). We were, however, able to provide some
information suggesting that the preponderant direc-
tion of effect flows from exercise to positive
psychological functioning, and there was no explicit
evidence for genetic influences common to positive
psychological function and exercise. It would be valu-

concordant MZ twins might undertake an exercise
program. These questions, however, can only be
addressed using longitudinal data. Finally, the size of
our sample of MZ twins discordant for level of exer-
cise was rather small at 63 pairs, limiting our power
to detect effects.
In spite of these limitations, our study has some
important strengths. The control for genetic and child-
hood environmental background provided by our
sample of MZ twins is very general -- it encompasses
all physical and behavioral variables influenced by
those backgrounds, whether we can specify them or
not. In addition, our use of a latent factor model made
it possible to assess positive psychological functioning
at a very general level without measurement error.
The variance common to our measures of psycho-
logical functioning reflects a positive, expansive sense
of capacity to cope with life. Our evidence that exer-
cise contributes to this sense is consistent with
Salmon's (2001) theory of exercise training as stress
adaptation. Drawing on Lees and Dygdon's (1988)
argument that exercise can initially be unpleasant but
can over time become pleasant due to counter-
conditioning, or the suppression of an unwanted
response to a stimulus by the conditioning of a com-
peting (e.g., endorphin) response, Salmon (2001)
noted that the effects of counter-conditioning rou-
tinely extend beyond the originally aversive stimulus
in nonhuman animal experiments so that counter-con-
ditioning becomes a more general form of `toughening
up' (Gray, 1982). For example, after developing toler-
ance to exposure to cold water through
counter-conditioning, animals also display tolerance to
uncontrollable electric shock, and vice versa (Weiss et
al., 1975).
In nonhuman animals, this kind of toughening up
reflects not just reduced sensitivity or greater resilience
to stress, but also reduced anxiety and depression as
evidenced by the similarity of effects to those of anxi-
olytic and antidepressant drugs (Gray, 1982).
Investigations of the specific neurochemical pathways
involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and the endoge-
nous opioid systems are in process (Salmon, 2001).
We thus speculate that experience of the toughening-
up process involved in engagement in vigorous
exercise may generalize to other areas of life, provid-
ing the psychological resources needed to exert more
effective control of emotional, relational, and intellec-
tual as well as physical areas of life. In addition, we
speculate that the toughening-up process involved in
engagement in vigorous exercise may be one way to
develop the psychological characteristic fundamentally
underlying resilience (Ciccehetti & Garmezy, 1993;
Masten et al., 1999).
This theory about the psychological benefits of
exercise and evidence supporting it may contribute to
our understanding of the way in which exercise bene-
fits physical health as well. McEwen (1993; McEwen
& Wingfield, 2003) has suggested that organisms cope
with stress through the adaptive process of allostasis,
or the active maintenance of physiological stability
through the production of hormones, neurotransmit-
ters, and cytokines that regulate metabolic,
cardiovascular, and immune responses. Regulation of
this process of allostasis takes place in the brain
(McEwen, 2004). When allostasis is activated too
often or inefficiently managed, individuals are more
vulnerable to stress-related physical diseases. The
counter-conditioning involved in generating reduced
sensitivity or greater resilience to stress as a result of
vigorous exercise may be the very mechanism that
enables the individual to maintain better allostatic
balance and resist physical illness, thus linking brain,
body, and behavior.
The particular form of our study highlights an
important aspect of these psychological and physical
counter-conditioning processes, to the extent they
exist. Because we made use of MZ twins, we know
that the differences in psychological functioning we
observed cannot be attributed to genomic differences.
At the same time, the specific mechanisms hypothe-
sized to be involved in the counter-conditioning
processes are highly biological and thus must also
involve genetic action. It is very likely that the appar-
ent contradiction between an absence of genomic
differences and differences in manifestation of pheno-
types that depend on genetic action will be resolved
through understanding how genetic expression varies
across different social and personal contexts of physi-
cal exercise. Our results thus serve as an inspiration
for future sociogenomic research.
