Introduction
The Internet is very useful for a variety of purposes, such as
convenient electronic commerce, rapid sharing of informa-
tion, contact with other cultures, emotional support, and
entertainment (Kraut et al., 1998; Morahan-Martin, 1999;
Scherer, 1997). A smartphone combines the services of the
Internet and a mobile phone. Smartphones offer qualitatively
different services in addition to the benefits that the Internet
offers. Young people watch videos, express themselves,
communicate with friends, and search for information using
smartphones, while older people use their smartphone for
having video calls with their children living far away and for
playing games. The portability and accessibility of a smart-
phone make it possible to use it anywhere, for any duration.
Worldwide, smartphones were used by 1.85
billion
people in 2014. This number is expected to be 2.32billion
in 2017 and 2.87billion in 2020 (Statista, 2017). In 2015,
a median of 54percent across 21 emerging and develop-
ing countries such as Malaysia, Brazil, and China reported
using the Internet at least occasionally or owning a smart-
phone. In comparison, a median of 87percent reported the
same across 11 advanced economies, including the United
States and Canada, major Western European nations,
developed Pacific nations (Australia, Japan, and South
Korea), and Israel (Pew Research Center, 2016). In the
findings of a survey conducted in 40 nations, South Korea
showed the highest rate of smartphone ownership (88%)
followed by Australia (77%), and the United States (72%).
In a survey on Korean smartphone use in 2016, 83.6per-
cent of Koreans aged over 3
years were found to use a
smartphone. Among them, 86.7
percent of males and
80.6percent of females reported using a smartphone, and
95.9percent of teenagers were found to use a smartphone
(Korea Internet and Security Agency, 2017). Indeed,
smartphone users are increasing across the world.

Abstract
This study aimed to examine smartphone use patterns, smartphone addiction characteristics, and the predictive factors of
the smartphone addiction in middle school students in South Korea. According to the Smartphone Addiction Proneness
Scale scores, 563 (30.9%) were classified as a risk group for smartphone addiction and 1261 (69.1%) were identified as
a normal user group. The adolescents used mobile messengers for the longest, followed by Internet surfing, gaming, and
social networking service use. The two groups showed significant differences in smartphone use duration, awareness of
game overuse, and purposes of playing games. The predictive factors of smartphone addiction were daily smartphone
and social networking service use duration, and the awareness of game overuse.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
Smartphones offer several conveniences in our life, but
we also need to be aware of the negative effects of smart-
phone use, the most concerning aspect being smartphone
addiction. Smartphone addiction is a phenomenon that per-
tains to uncontrollability of smartphone use. People with
this problem encounter social, psychological, and health
problems (Heron and Shapira, 2004; Young, 1999).
Specifically, adolescents are a high risk group for
smartphone addiction. Adolescents are strongly attached
to their smartphone, and they regard a smartphone as
their second self. Many smartphone users have reported
that they would not be able to live without a smartphone
(Wajcman et al., 2007). Developmentally, adolescents
experience several physical and psychological changes.
While, on one hand, they are dependent on their parents
with reference to their life and identity, on the other hand,
they are trying to be independent of their parents, to
establish their identity and to create an independent space
for themselves. During these changes, a smartphone
becomes indispensable for adolescents. They are inter-
ested in new technology and get used to the operation of
such devices more easily than adults do. Adolescents, as
digital natives, express their thought in an online space,
try to keep up with fashion, use many kinds of applica-
tions (apps), and search for emotional relationships and
support. They are good in multitasking, and they pursue
instant reactions and feedback (Tapscott, 2009). When
these characteristics, including novelty seeking in ado-
lescents, are combined with their immature control com-
petence, they are placed at a high risk of smartphone
addiction (Chambers et al., 2003).
In this study, we targeted adolescents aged 13 to 15years,
to examine the characteristics of their smartphone addic-
tion. In addition, we compared a risk group for smartphone
addiction and a normal user group in terms of their smart-
phone use patterns and examined the risk factors for smart-
phone addiction.
Literature review
Smartphone addiction
Smartphone addiction is considered to be rooted in
Internet addiction due to the similarity of the symptoms
and negative effects on users. Internet addiction is defined
as an impulse control disorder, characterized by patho-
logical Internet use (Goldberg, 1996; Young, 1998).
Smartphone addiction could be categorized as a behavio-
ral addiction, such as Internet addiction. Behavioral and
chemical addictions have seven core symptoms in com-
mon, that is, salience, tolerance, mood modification, con-
flict, withdrawal, problems, and relapse (Grant et al.,
2010; Griffiths, 2005). These common points are not
integrally researched, but each symptom has been found
in smartphone addiction studies. For instance, Lin et al.
(2014) reported four features of smartphone addiction,
that is, compulsion, functional impairment, tolerance,
and withdrawal. Bianchi and Phillips (2005) suggested
that smartphone overuse associated with psychological
symptoms constitutes a form of behavioral addiction.
Smartphone addiction is also considered a technological
addiction that involves human­machine interaction
(Griffiths, 1995).
Smartphone addiction is considered as the inability to
control the smartphone use despite negative effects on
users. The use of a smartphone not only produces pleasure
and reduces feelings of pain and stress but also leads to
failure to control the extent of use despite significant
harmful consequences in financial, physical, psychologi-
cal, and social aspects of life (Shaffer, 1996; Van Deursen
et al., 2015; Young, 1999). Addiction to media has been
characterized as excessive or poorly controlled preoccu-
pations, and compulsive needs or behaviors that lead to
impairment (Demirci et al., 2014; Shaw and Black, 2008).
A study reported that media addicts could not manage
real-life activities (Greenfield, 1999; Young, 2007). The
people using the Internet longer had poor social support
and higher levels of loneliness (Nie and Erbring, 2000).
Children using the cell phone displayed more behavioral
problems such as nervousness, temperament, mental dis-
traction, and indolence, and these problems worsened if
the children began using a cell phone at an early age
(Divan et al., 2012).
Awareness regarding the severity of smartphone addic-
tion has already been reflected in clinical science and
praxis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association
(APA), 2013) introduced the diagnostic criteria for Internet
gaming disorder and encouraged further research for listing
it as a formal diagnosis. Oulasvirta et al. (2012) reported
that the awareness of problems with repeated use of smart-
phones was underestimated, and only a few reported that
they were aware of it. The few respondents reported
repeated usage of a smartphone as annoying, addicting, "a
trap," and distracting. They were aware that repeated use
could lead to addiction; however, they were not aware of
the severity of the repeated and intense use of a smartphone.
If one is aware of the risks posed by smartphone addiction,
one would do something against it. The awareness of the
severity of smartphone addiction can, therefore, play a role
in preventing it.
Life satisfaction pertains to the normal evaluation of
one's surroundings, and subjective happiness or personal
contentment (Diener et al., 1985; Scheufele and Shah,
2000). Addiction to media could increase depressive symp-
toms and substance use, and it could decrease well-being
(Ha and Hwang, 2014; Yoo et al., 2014). Samaha and Hawi
(2016) showed that smartphone addiction is not directly
linked to life satisfaction, but it is linked via perceived
stress and academic performance.

Socioeconomic status
Gender, specifically, being male, is a risk factor for patho-
logical Internet use (Frangos et al., 2011). Results from mul-
tivariate logistic regression analyses have suggested
50
percent increased odds for males to be addicted to the
Internet (odds ratio (OR)
=
1.5, 95% confidence interval
(CI)=1.1, 2.2) as compared with females (Lam et al., 2009).
Women use the Internet mostly for social purposes and males
do so for downloading programs, getting information, and
for visiting pornographic sites (Tsitsika et al., 2009; Ybarra
and Mitchell, 2005). In contrast to Internet addiction, studies
on smartphone addiction reported that females were more
dependent on smartphones than males were (Billieux et al.,
2008). Females are more likely to be involved with their
mobile than males are (Walsh et al., 2011), owing to the dif-
ferences in the purpose of use of mobile phones. Males are
more likely to use their phones for functional purposes, such
as work-related use, whereas females primarily use their
phones to keep in contact with valued people (Lemish and
Cohen, 2005; Rees and Noyes, 2007). Thus, it seems that
males and females have different smartphone use patterns.
Adolescents would be more at risk of smartphone addic-
tion as compared with adults because adolescents are yet to
develop self-control in smartphone use. Adolescents with
working parents could be at a risk of smartphone addiction,
possibly because such children could not be cared by their
parents after school and they would use smartphones with-
out any rules and guidance.
Regarding the income of smartphone users, there were
different research results. While one study reported that
students from higher income families spent more time and
money on their mobile phone, another revealed that lower
income students used their mobile phones more often
(Chakraborty, 2006; Zulkefly and Baharudin, 2009). A Pew
Research Center survey (2016) reported that people with
more education and higher income were more likely to use
the Internet or own a smartphone than were those with
lower income and less education.
Smartphone usage pattern
Smartphone addicts spend considerable time using their
smartphone. The daily use duration of a smartphone is one
of the most significant indicators of smartphone addiction.
Torrecillas (2007) reported that 40
percent of adolescents
and adults use smartphones for more than 4hours a day to
make calls and send messages. In addition, such people
showed more problems in psychosocial, health, and techno-
logical dimensions, and they exhibited more preoccupation
with smartphones and smartphone overuse as compared
with those who used a smartphone for less than 4hours per
day (Alijomaa et al., 2016).
The causes of smartphone use can be attributed to the
technological and content-related features of a smartphone.
Regarding technological features, Oulasvirta et al. (2012)
reported that the motivation of smartphone use is triggered
by accessibility, portability, easiness of operation, connect-
edness, user interface, design, music and video player, navi-
gation, and so forth. In Europe, smartphone users touched
their phones about 10 to 200 times a day, for a mean dura-
tion of 10­250seconds, and they used up 1­1000megabyte
(MB) data per day (Falaki et al., 2010). Oulasvirta et al.
(2012) suggested that smartphone addiction increased
owing to the habit of checking the phone on hearing a noti-
fication sound or message. With reference to content-related
features, Van Deursen et al. (2015) reported that social
smartphone use is one of the risk factors increasing smart-
phone addiction. Salehan and Negahban (2013) suggested
that the predictive variable for smartphone addiction is the
use of social networking services (SNSs). Park and Lee
(2012) reported that smartphone addicts prefer to use SNSs,
which could explain why females are more addicted to
smartphones than males are. Song et al. (2004) classified the
types of Internet use in relation with addictive behaviors.
One type is process-related gratifications, which are
acquired during consuming or prosuming media. Pleasurable
experiences function as rewards and increase the risk of
habitual or addictive behaviors. Another type of Internet use
is social usage. Smartphone addicts spend most of their time
on their smartphone for social purposes (Li and Chung,
2006; Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014). Furthermore, exces-
sive use of SNSs can negatively impact one's academic per-
formance (Enriquez, 2010; Junco, 2012). In relation gaming,
one study reported that the use of a smartphone for gaming
and the use of multiple apps for gaming were potential risk
factors for smartphone addiction, because, in smartphone
gaming, it is easy to interact with other players through
other social networking apps. Smartphone gaming, with or
without the use of multiple apps, increases the risk of smart-
phone addiction (Liu et al., 2016).
A study on the relative effects of content types on smart-
phone addiction showed that, among smartphone contents
such as study, entertainment, SNS, and game, except for
study-related content, the other three contents were signifi-
cant predictors of smartphone addiction. SNS had the
strongest predictive effect on smartphone addiction, fol-
lowed by entertainment, and gaming (Jeong et al., 2016;
Salehan and Negahban, 2013).
Psychological and physical health problem
Smartphone addiction affects physical and psychological
health (Abo-Jedi, 2008). Depression or anxiety can cause
technology addiction, in that individuals with depression or
anxiety use smartphone as a coping method to deal with
depressive and negative emotions (Kim et al., 2015).
Smartphone addicts engage in checking behavior and react
to notification sounds frequently. That is also a characteris-
tic of depression and anxiety (Cougle et al., 2012; Evraire
4 Health Psychology Open 
and Dozois, 2011). A longitudinal study on heavy users of a
computer, social media, and mobile phone showed greater
level of prolonged stress, depression, and sleep distur-
bances (Thomée et al., 2011). Excessive smartphone use at
night could keep one awake till late, thus impairing sleep
and influencing stress and depression (Lemola et al., 2015).
Screen time and Internet usage were found to affect sleep
(Brunborg et al., 2011; Vollmer et al., 2012), and SNS
addicts were reported to show poorer sleep quality than
non-SNS addicts did (Wolniczak et al., 2013).
The negative effects of smartphone overuse on physical
health include cancer; brain tumor; nervous disturbances;
weakening of the immune system; problems with the eardrum;
pain in the wrist, neck, and joints; fatigue; and sleep disorders
(Alasdair and Philips, 2017; Richard, 2001).
As stated above, the overuse of the smartphone causes
health problems, but the deprivation of a smartphone can also
cause health problems. For instance, smartphone addicts were
reported to feel distressed when deprived of their smartphone
for some time, and adolescents exhibited anxiety, depression,
anger, and sleep disturbances when their smartphones were
switched off (Assabawy, 2006; Torrecillas, 2007).

Material and methods
Participants
Participants were 1824 middle school students who used a
smartphone. They were sampled randomly from strata based
on city, age, and sex. The mean age of the participants was
15.6
years (standard deviation (SD)=0.78), with 51percent
males and 49percent females. Furthermore, 498 (27.3%) of
them were in the first grade, 724 (39.7%) were in the second
grade, and 602 (33.0%) were in the third grade of middle
school in 17 cities in South Korea, for example, Seoul,
Busan, Daegu, and Daejeon. Trained interviewers conducted
face-to-face interviews with the participants. Before they
were interviewed, the participants were informed about the
survey and their consent to participate in the study was
sought. Their participation was rewarded by a gift worth
5000
won (US$4). This survey was conducted by Korean
Information Society Agency, to investigate the status of
smartphone addiction in Korea and the perception of the
Korean people on the same.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire included items on demographic variables,
smartphone addictive behavior, and risk factors for smart-
phone addiction. The participants responded to questions on
smartphone use patterns, such as the duration of daily smart-
phone use; commonly used content of a smartphone, such as
game, SNS, music, or learning; and the purposes of the con-
tent used, such as fun/stress reduction, communication with
people, accessing latest information, or passing time.
Regarding smartphone content, we asked more about the
SNSandgamethatwereusedmostfrequently(e.g.Facebook,
Twitter, Kakaostory, Band, Instagram, or others), the dura-
tion and purpose of SNS and game use, the time slot of gam-
ing, the awareness of gaming overuse, the use frequency of a
PC room (PC room is a place where one can use the fastest
PC for gaming by paying some money), and the monthly
expenditure for using a PC room.
In addition, we assessed physical and psychological
health problems caused by smartphone use. Physical health
problems included dry eyes, sleep disturbances, pain in
neck/wrist/back, digital dementia, chronic tiredness, and
others. Psychological problems included anger, annoyance,
anxiety, depression, aggression, lethargy, and others.
Participants could choose multiple responses to report the
problems that they faced.
Regarding smartphone addiction, we sought responses to
questions on the degree of life and relationship satisfaction,
and future career plan. These questions were rated on a 4-point
Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), to
respond to the following statements: "I am satisfied with my
life," "I am satisfied with my relationships," "I have a career
plan after graduating from the school" (see Appendix 1).
We assessed the awareness on the severity of smart-
phone addiction in Korea, experience of prevention educa-
tion on smartphone addiction, and efficacy of the education
using the following questions: "Is the prevention education
on smartphone addiction helpful?" The question was rated
on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 1 (not helpful at all) to
4 (very helpful).
Cha and Seo 5
To measure the prevalence of smartphone addiction in
middle school students, we used a validated Smartphone
Addiction Proneness Scale (Korean Information Society
Agency, 2011). This self-rating questionnaire contains 15
items across three subscales, namely, daily difficulties,
intolerance, and withdrawal. Sample items include "My
school grades dropped due to excessive smartphone use,"
"My family or friends complain that I use my smartphone
too much," and "I panic when I cannot use my smart-
phone." The items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale
from 1 (never) to 4 (always). Some items are scored in
reverse order to avoid a response bias. The scores range
from 15 to 60, with a clinical cutoff score of 42. The inter-
nal consistency of this tool was r=0.82 (Korean
Information Society Agency, 2011).
Data analysis
A chi-square test was conducted to investigate differences
in the demographic variables and smartphone use behaviors
between the smartphone addiction and normal user groups.
A t test was used to examine differences in the use duration
of smartphone, SNS, game, and messenger services
between the two groups. Subsequently, a multiple linear
regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors
of smartphone addiction. Results were considered signifi-
cant at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 22.0.
Results
Of the 1824 participants, 563 (30.9%) were identified as a
risk group for smartphone addiction and 1261 (69.1%)
were classified as a normal user group according to their
scores on the Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale. The
risk group for smartphone addiction showed significantly
higher scores on the scale as well as on each subscale of the
tool as compared with the normal users (Table 1).
Before analyzing the difference in smartphone usage
pattern between the two groups, we conducted a chi-square
test to examine whether these groups differed in terms of
gender, age, income form of parents, monthly family
income level, and occupation of parents (Table 2). There
were no differences in the demographic variables between
the two groups. Both groups consisted of almost equal pro-
portions of women and men. The average age was 15years
in both groups, and 60
percent of them were from a dual
income family. There was no difference in monthly average
household income and parental occupation. Thus, the two
groups showed a homogeneous composition.
The risk group for smartphone addiction used a smart-
phone for an average of 313.13minutes per day, which was
33.17
minutes longer than that of the normal user group.
This difference was statistically significant (t=6.16,
p=0.000). Even regarding smartphone use duration exclud-
ing the time spent on calls and text messages, the risk group
spent longer than the normal user group (t=6.50, p=0.000).
The adolescents were using the mobile messenger for the
longest duration, followed by Internet surfing, game, and
SNS. Surprisingly, they were using SNSs for the shortest
duration. The risk group for smartphone addiction used the
mobile messenger, SNS, and Internet for significantly
longer as compared with the normal user group. However,
the normal user group played games for significantly longer
than the risk group (Table 3).
The respondents were instructed to select two contents
of a smartphone and SNS that they used most frequently,
and the two purposes of using SNSs. As evident from Table
4, 30­40
percent of the respondents used web surfing and
instant mobile messenger contents the most, and more than
20percent of the respondents used music, games, and social
networking. There was no difference between the two
groups regarding the contents used.
Regarding the commonly used SNSs and the reasons
for the same, there was no difference between the two
groups. The most frequently used SNSs were Kakaostory

(67.9%) and Facebook (47.3%). The purposes for using
SNS were as follows: 66.5
percent of the participants
answered that SNS use was fun and it relieved stress, and
48.3
percent used SNSs for communicating with others
(Table 4).
There was a significant difference between the two
groups in terms of the awareness of their excessive game

normal user group. To identify the sources of differences,
we further analyzed the positive and negative answers
regarding the awareness of game overuse. There was no
significant difference in the positive answers to game over-
use awareness. However, the percentage of respondents
who replied "I strongly disagree" was 23.2 in the risk group
and it was 16.9 in the normal users. The percentage of
respondents who replied "I disagree" was 60.7 in the risk
group and 66.8 in the normal users group. Thus, the risk
group showed a stronger denial of their game overuse than
the normal user group did.
Regarding the time slot of game use, there was no sig-
nificant difference between the two groups. Specifically,
69.1
percent of the respondents used a game between
4:00
p.m. and 8:00
p.m., after school and at night, and
18.2percent used it between 6:00a.m. and 9:00a.m., after
waking up and on the way to school. In relation with the
purposes of gaming, most of the respondents selected "fun"
(66.5%) and "stress reduction" (48.3%), as observed in the
reported reasons for SNS use. The risk group for smart-
phone addiction played games more habitually and they did
so for achieving targets on the game, as compared with the
normal user group. There was a significant difference in the
purpose of gaming between the two groups (2=19.93,
p=.001) (Table 5).
The binary logistic regression analysis showed that the
variables related to the risk of smartphone addiction were
"after school (04:00p.m. to 08:00p.m.)" of the time slot of
game use, "once in a month," "3 or 4 times in a year," and
"never" of the frequency of using PC room. The people
who used a game after school (04:00
p.m. to 08:00
p.m.)
were 2.65 times more likely to be addicted to the smart-
phone addiction that gamers in the morning. The people
who used a PC room once in a month, or 3 or 4 times in a

year, or never showed a 0.50­0.67 times lower rate of risk
of smartphone addiction than the people using PC room 3
or 4 times in a week.
The two groups showed a significant difference in the fre-
quency of use and the monthly expenditure on a PC room. A
significantly higher proportion of those in the normal user
group reported that they had never visited a PC room as com-
pared with their counterparts in the risk group (2=30.31,
p=0.000). The monthly expenditure for using the PC room
was 221won (ca. US$1.89) higher for the normal user group
as compared with that for the risk group (t=­2.96, p=0.003).
As evident from Table 6, there was no significant differ-
ence between the two groups in terms of the physical and
psychological health problems caused by using a
smartphone, but an emerging tendency was observed with
reference to psychological health problems. The most com-
mon physical problems were sleep disturbance (31.7%) and
dry eyes and decreased visual acuity (30.2%). The most
frequently reported psychological health problems were
anger (31.1%) in the risk group for smartphone addiction,
and annoyance (30.5%) in the normal user group.
Furthermore, the risk group showed more depression and
lethargy than the normal user group did. These differences
were not significant but showed a tendency for significant
differences (2=12.93, p=0.074).
In relation with life satisfaction, 82.2
percent of the
respondents answered that they were satisfied with their
life. The difference in life satisfaction between the two

groups was not significant, but the analysis showed a ten-
dency for significant differences (2=7.64, p=0.054). The
percentage of respondents who answered that they were
satisfied with life was higher in the normal user group as
compared with that in the risk group for smartphone
addiction.
There was no significant difference in satisfaction
with interpersonal relationships and career plans between
the two groups. Specifically, 80.9percent of the respond-
ents answered that they were satisfied with their interper-
sonal relationships, and 75.9percent of them had a clear
career plan.
There were no significant differences between the two
groups regarding the recognition that smartphone addiction
was severe in Korea, but the difference showed a tendency
for significance (2=7.20, p=0.07). The percentage of
respondents who considered that the smartphone addiction
was severe in Korea was higher in the risk group than it was
in the normal user group.
The percentage of people who received prevention
education on smartphone addiction was 13.4
percent in
both groups. Among the participants who received pre-
vention education, the proportion of those who answered
that the education was helpful was 78percent in the risk
group and 64.6percent in the normal user group. This dif-
ference was statistically significant (2=8.93, p=0.03;
Table 7).
Multiple linear regression
Based on the above findings, the association between predic-
tive factors and smartphone addiction was examined using a
multiple linear regression. The dependent variable was the
score on the smartphone addiction scale, while the independ-
ent variables were those which showed significant differences
in the preceding analyses, including duration of smartphone,
mobile instant messenger, SNS, and game use; awareness of
game overuse; and frequency and expenditure of PC room
use. The multicollinearity of the independent variables was
not violated because the variance inflation factors (VIFs)
were
<10, and the Durbin­Watson was 1.656. However, the
resulting regression model explained merely 3.8
percent of
the variance in smartphone addiction (R2=0.038, F(7,
1086)=6.19, p
=
0.000). The significant predictors of smart-
phone addiction were daily use duration of smartphone
(t=3.86, p
=
0.000) and SNS (t=­3.569, p=0.000), and
awareness of game overuse (t=­3.111, p=0.002). The results
of this analysis are presented in Table 8.
Discussion
This study aimed to reveal the smartphone usage pattern of
addicted and nonaddicted middle school students, and to
identify the predictors of smartphone addiction. Therefore,
we examined the prevalence of smartphone addiction,

demographic characteristics, daily use duration of a smart-
phone, commonly used content, and SNS and game usage
pattern. To explore the risks and predictive factors of smart-
phone addiction, we examined the physical and psycho-
logical health problems caused by smartphone usage, the
awareness of smartphone addiction severity, and the effect
of prevention education on smartphone addiction.
The prevalence of smartphone addiction in Korean
middle school students was 30.9percent. It is a very high
rate compared with that reported in other countries. The
percentages of smartphone addiction in adolescents were
10percent in England, 21percent in the Philippines, and
18percent in Hong Kong (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2014;
Mak et al., 2014). The Korean government has recog-
nized the severity of smartphone addiction problems in
adolescents, and the Framework Act on National
Informatization was established in 2013, to help tackle
this problem. According to Article 30 of the act, all
schools and public institutions are obliged to carry out
prevention education on smartphone addiction. Although
this rule exists since 2013, merely 13.4percent of the pre-
sent sample reported having received smartphone addic-
tion prevention education, which could be regarded as
very low without considering other circumstances such
as budget, reward, and administrative procedures. Among
those who received such education, a high proportion of
the respondents reported that the prevention education
was very helpful or helpful, and this proportion was
higher in the risk group for smartphone addiction (78.0%)
than that in the normal user group (63.6%). This result
indicated that the education was effective, and that it
needs to focus more on those at risk of developing smart-
phone addiction rather than on normal users.
Contrary to our hypothesis, smartphone addiction was
not related with gender, family income, or parents' educa-
tion. These results are consistent with those of some studies
that reported that smartphone addiction is not significantly
related with gender (Attamimi, 2011; Chung, 2011; Kwon
et al., 2013; Prezza et al., 2004). In a study on cell phone
usage of children aged 8­18
years, neither household
income nor parents' education was found to have an effect
on the use of smartphones (Groupe Speciale Mobile
(GSMA), 2011). As smartphones offer a variety of content
tailored to individual interests, every individual from dif-
ferent socioeconomic backgrounds could find content that
he or she is interested in, or which fulfills his or her need or

deficiency. Thus, demographic variables showed no rela-
tionship with smartphone addiction.
The main purposes of using SNSs and games were fun,
stress reduction, and communication with people. This
result seems to be natural, but it should be interpreted by
reflecting on the Korean society, which emphasizes greatly
on children's education. Adolescents in Korea have been
expected to exhibit good academic performance in a com-
petitive social atmosphere. They experience high levels of
stress associated with academic performance (Park et al.,
2014). They are forced to study for about 7
hours 50
min-
utes per day for exams to enter a prestigious university.
This is much longer as compared with that reported in other
countries, where the duration of studies ranges from 3 to
6hours (National Youth Policy Institute, 2009). Most of the
adolescents, thus, spend their little free time on a smart-
phone, because there are not many leisure activities to
relieve stress and have fun. In this environment, promoting
smartphone use with the inability to control their smart-
phone use despite negative consequences could lead to
addiction. The high prevalence of smartphone addiction in
Korean adolescents should, thus, be interpreted considering
the social environment.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the two groups showed no
differences in life and relationship satisfaction. Life satis-
faction is partly related with social ties (Kahneman and
Krueger, 2006), and frequent social communication has
been found to exert a positive influence on life satisfaction
(Diener et al., 1991). Internet users have fewer face-to-face
interactions like heavy television watchers do (Nie, 2001).
Smartphone addicts who spend a lot of time on their phone
are forced to reduce their face-to-face contact time.
Therefore, smartphone addiction is considered to be related
with loneliness and shyness (Bian and Leung, 2014).
Specifically, the higher one scores on shyness and loneli-
ness, the higher is the likelihood that one would be addicted
to a smartphone. In this sense, we hypothesized that the risk
group for smartphone addiction will have lower interper-
sonal and life satisfaction than the normal user group
would. However, the risk group merely showed a tendency
to exhibit lower life satisfaction as compared with the nor-
mal user group. Our result suggested that life and interper-
sonal satisfaction levels could not explain the addictive use
of smartphone alone. Samaha and Hawi (2016) reported
that smartphone addiction is not directly linked to life satis-
faction, but it is via perceived stress and academic perfor-
mance. Satisfaction with life should be explained by many
other factors such as family support, doing what they want
to do, personality, positive thinking, and so on. Future stud-
ies should investigate the relationship of smartphone addic-
tion with life satisfaction and other related variables to
identify the extent to which smartphone addiction can be
explained by life satisfaction, and to reveal the path of the
influence of life satisfaction on smartphone addiction.
However, the satisfaction of the online interpersonal
relationships in the risk group for smartphone addiction
may have offset the low satisfaction with their offline inter-
personal relationships. To further examine the relationship
between interpersonal satisfaction and smartphone addic-
tion, future studies should examine the effects of both
online and offline relationships.
Consistent with other studies (Alijomaa et al., 2016;
Torrecillas, 2007), we found that the risk group for smart-
phone addiction spent more time on the smartphone, mobile
messenger, and SNSs than the normal user group did.
Specifically, the risk group spent 5.2
hours while the nor-
mal user group 4.6hours. Oulasvirta et al. (2012) reported
that though smartphone addicts used a smartphone more
frequently and for a shorter duration as compared with non-
addicts, the sum of the duration of use in a day was longer
for addicts as compared with that for nonaddicts. Another
study that analyzed a large data set on actual smartphone
usage revealed that the users typically spent almost 1 hour
per day on the smartphone, but the duration was less than 1
minute at each instance of use (Boehmer et al., 2011). This
study reported also the differences in app usage duration.
News apps were accessed most frequently in the morning,
whereas communication apps were used throughout the
day. Using a data set on smartphone use, Lee et al. (2012)
showed that a risk group for smartphone addiction spent
more time on smartphone use per day as compared with the
nonrisk group, and their use was greater in the morning and
evening. The usage sessions initiated by the push notifica-
tions were longer for the risk group, which demonstrated
that notifications acted as external cues related to problem-
atic usage patterns. In addition, the risk group consumed
significantly more online content that can provide instant
gratification (e.g. pass time, entertainment, and information
seeking).
The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the
daily use duration of a smartphone and SNS, and the aware-
ness of game overuse predicted smartphone addiction. As
expected, longer daily use duration of a smartphone pre-
dicted higher scores on the smartphone addiction scale, but
the awareness of game overuse predicted lower scores on
the smartphone addiction scale. Surprisingly, the shorter
daily use duration of SNS negatively predicted smartphone
addiction, which was contrary to our hypothesis and that of
other studies. Roberts et al. (2014) found that, among col-
lege undergraduates, one of the predictors of mobile phone
addiction was time spent on SNSs. In a European cross-
sectional study, Lopez-Fernandez et al. (2017) reported that
daily use of a mobile phone, increased social networking,
female gender, not necessarily monthly payment as type of
contract, online shopping, viewing TV shows, download-
ing-related activities, and messaging and chatting predicted
mobile phone dependence in young adults. However, the
above studies focused on young adults, and we could not
find any studies on SNS use duration in adolescents aged
13­15
years. This study showed that the long SNS
12 Health Psychology Open 
use duration was not related to smartphone addiction in
adolescents because the Pearson's correlation coefficient of
SNS use duration with the smartphone addiction score was
not significant (r=0.012, p=0.604). However, the SNS use
duration could function as a protective factor in combina-
tion with other variables. That is, when adolescents use a
smartphone daily for a long duration, using SNS could pro-
tect them from smartphone addiction by engaging in the
use of mobile messengers or gaming apps. It seems that
using SNS has a positive function of preventing smart-
phone addition. This result must however be verified in a
future study.
Limitations
While this study provides new insights into the smartphone
usage pattern of middle school students in Korea, who are
in a specific social environment, and the different usage
patterns of the addiction and normal user groups, this study
has some limitations.
First, this survey was conducted using face-to-face
interviews. Therefore, social desirability may have influ-
enced the adolescents' responses. Intentionally or uninten-
tionally, they might not have been frank about the use
duration and content used on a smartphone. Lin et al. (2015)
revealed a significant discrepancy in self-reported and in-
application recorded smartphone use duration. Often,
smartphone users underestimate the use duration, and this
underestimation is greater in more frequent users than in
nonfrequent users. To improve the awareness of smart-
phone use, future studies should investigate the difference
between self-reported and technological records of smart-
phone use. Self-reported data and actual smartphone use
data could provide a comprehensive explanation about
smartphone usage patterns.
Second, some variables were measured subjectively,
using simple questions rather than standardized scales. For
instance, life and interpersonal relationship satisfaction,
and health and psychological problems were based on sub-
jective evaluations. Therefore, to obtain objective data on
these variables, it is necessary to use standardized assess-
ment scales and diagnostic interviews conducted by a psy-
chological or psychiatric professional.
Third, the prevalence of smartphone addiction was high
in this study as compared with that observed in other coun-
tries, but the prevalence could not be compared with other
studies because each study used different scales to assess
smartphone addiction. Cross-country studies need to be
conducted to using a common smartphone addiction scale
to enable comparisons and interchange of strategies for pre-
venting and treating smartphone addiction.
Fourth, this study provided a broad picture of smart-
phone use and addiction, but this study could not provide a
more focused and deep understanding. This study was a
part of a national survey on the state of smartphone
addiction and awareness of Koreans regarding it. Future
studies should focus on one theme, for example, type of
smartphone addiction, such as SNS, game, shopping, or
sexual content. Various addiction types would show differ-
ent usage patterns and user characteristics. Therefore, a
deeper understanding of the same would be helpful for
developing effective therapies and preventive programs
according to the needs of the individual.
