Purpose: This study investigated discrepan-
cies in expectations of aging parents and their
middle-aged offspring regarding future inherit-
ances. Methods: Data from 327 older par-
ent­adult child dyads were analyzed. Using
multilevel models, we examined factors (e.g., eco-
nomic resources, family characteristics, current sup-
port exchanges, and beliefs about family obligation)
associated with expectations of inheritance. We also
explored patterns of correspondence in expectations
over inheritance within dyads and what factors are
associated with these patterns. Results: We
found a significant generational difference in expec-
tations of inheritance, with children less likely to
expect inheritances than parents expected to give.
Parent's income, number of siblings, and support cur-
rently given to children were significantly associated
with both parents' and children's positive expecta-
tions of inheritance. The effects of child's income,
support given to parent, and parent's gender on
inheritance expectations differed between parents
and children. Compared with discordant dyads
(parents intended to leave a bequest, but their child
did not expect an inheritance), correspondent dyads
(both parents and children expected a bequest)
showed higher income of parents and children,
more support given to the child, and lower levels of
child's filial obligation. Implications: Although
bequest decisions are circumscribed by parent's
financial resources, our findings suggest that they
are also a continuation of established patterns of
exchanges. Parents and children form their intention
or expectation about inheritance based on different
factors, leaving open the possibility of misunder-
standings between the generations.

Significant attention has been given in recent
years to intergenerational support between aging
parents and their adult children,but family scholars
and gerontologists have largely overlooked the
"final" transfer between generations--inheritance.
The economic literature has long studied material
transfers among adult family generations through
inter-vivos gifts and inheritance, focusing on the
mechanism generating or maintaining social
inequality of wealth (Arrondel & Masson,
2006; Laitner, 1979; Menchik, 1980). Although
inheritance is executed after the death of the
parent, decisions regarding inheritance can impact
the lives of family members economically and

psychologically both before and after the person's
death (Angel & Mudrazija, 2011; Sousa, Silva,
Santos, & Patrão, 2010). Aging parents usually
have made plans for bequests in advance, and their
adult children also form their own expectations of
receiving an inheritance.These implicit and explicit
expectations of family members surrounding
inheritance may influence decisions about support
exchanges and relationship outcomes between
generations, especially in aging families (Caputo,
2005).
Despite the importance of multiple perspec-
tives among family members in transfer decisions
(Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2004), the investigation of
bequest behaviors has mainly considered the aging
parents' perspective (McGarry, 1999). The few
studies considering adult children have examined
separately the correlates of parents' bequest deci-
sions and children's inheritance expectations (Kao,
Hong, & Widdows, 1997; Künemund, Motel-
Klingebiel, & Kohli, 2005). Moreover, there is
little empirical work on whether children's expec-
tations of inheritance are in agreement with their
parents' plans for bequests and whether children
understand parental motives behind the bequest
intentions. Under some circumstances, discrepan-
cies in views on inheritance between parents and
children could lead to family conflict and affect
current exchanges and relationships (Stum, 2000).
This study extends the investigation of inherit-
ance by incorporating perspectives from both par-
ents and their children. In this study, we used data
obtained from 327 dyads of aging parents (aged
59­96 years) and middle-aged children (aged
40­60 years) about their expectations regard-
ing inheritance, including the parent's intention
to leave a bequest and the child's expectations of
receiving an inheritance. First, we investigated fac-
tors associated with expectations of inheritance
reported by parents and their offspring as well
as whether the effects of these factors differed
between parents and children. Second, we looked
specifically at whether expectations about inherit-
ances are in agreement within parent­child dyads
and examined the correlates of correspondence
patterns.
Theories on Bequest Motives
Most of the economic literature on inheritance
has examined motivations of older parents to leave
bequests to their children, based on two compet-
ing explanations: altruism and exchange­strategic
models (Arrondel & Masson, 2006). The altruism
model assumes parental affection, moral duty, or
obligation as a basis for providing help in situa-
tions of need (Becker, 1991). Based on altruism
theory, parents would be expected to leave the
largest bequests to the least well-off children.
Thus, studies that examine parental motivations of
bequests have focused on variables regarding chil-
dren's financial status, such as income, education,
and assets (Altonji, Hayashi, & Kotlikoff, 2002;
Wilhelm, 1996).
In contrast, exchange models emphasize self-
interest motives to maximize personal rewards and
minimize personal costs even in relationships with
significant others, including family members (Cox
& Rank, 1992). According to this model, bequests
represent payments for assistance and attention
received from children. Parents may use the pros-
pect of future bequests to induce their children to
provide care to them when they are old and to have
some control over the behavior of their offspring
(Bernheim, Shleifer, Summers, 1985; Kotlikoff &
Morris, 1989). Therefore, the exchange model
has focused on examining associations between
bequests and child-to-parent inter-vivos transfers,
usually social support, including care and housing
(Izuhara, 2008).
However, empirical work on bequests has failed
to provide evidence supporting either altruistic or
exchange models. Inter-vivos transfers (as occur-
ring while the parents are alive) are more likely to
be given to less well-off children, which is consist-
ent with the altruistic model (McGarry & Schoeni,
1997). By contrast, in contemporary western soci-
eties, bequests tend to be divided in equal shares
among children, regardless of children's income or
informal support from children (McGarry, 1999;
Norton & van Houtven, 2006; Perozek, 1999;
Wilhelm, 1996).Thus, it appears that the economic
models provide limited predictability of bequest
behaviors.
Factors Associated With Expectations on
Bequest or Inheritance
This study focuses on family member's
expectations about inheritance and factors
associated with these expectations. In examining
bequest motives, prior studies have indicated
usefulness of "subjective" measures of expected
bequests (Hurd & Smith, 2001; McGarry, 1999).
Investigations based on "actual" bequests often
confound a wide range of measurement errors in
Vol. 53, No. 6, 2013 1021
estimating the amount of bequests as well as results
by unintended (accidental) bequests, which may
mask individuals' original motives behind bequest
plans (Hurd, 2003).
Individuals' motives for bequests may reflect
both their children's needs (altruism) and their own
desire for support while alive (exchange theory).
Drawing on the two competing theories and previ-
ous work on bequest motives, we considered four
sets of factors: (a) economic resources, (b) family
characteristics, (c) current support exchanges, and
(d) beliefs about family obligation. We considered
these factors with regard to both the parent's and
the child's perspective.
Economic Resources.--The financial circum-
stances of family members may be the main factor
in shaping parents' and children's expectations of
bequests because they are directly associated with
needs and resources for bequests. Although paren-
tal economic resources (e.g., income and wealth)
appear to be the most potent and consistent deter-
minant of bequest decisions in a positive direction
(Cox & Rank, 1992; McGarry, 1999), effects of
children's economic resources on bequests are not
clear. Studies found that parents are likely to divide
inheritance equally among all children, regardless
of their income (Altonji, Hayashi, & Kotlikoff,
1992; McGarry, 1999; Wilhelm, 1996). However,
other studies also showed that children's education,
as a proxy of socioeconomic status, is positively
associated with bequest probability; children with
more education are likely to receive more in paren-
tal bequests (Kao et al., 1997; McGarry, 1999).
Family Characteristics.--We considered effects
of two family characteristics (e.g., number of sib-
lings and race) on family members' expectations
of a bequest. First, number of siblings appears to
have a negative effect on the probability of receiv-
ing inter-vivos financial support from parents
(Schoeni, 1997). In particular, given that bequests
are usually (equally or unequally) divided among
siblings, the share of bequest that each child will
receive would decrease with the number of siblings
as competitors for resources (Hurd, 2003).
In addition, given racial differences in the mode
of intergenerational support, family members'
expectations of inheritance may differ by race.
Prior studies have shown that White families are
more likely to exchange financial and emotional
support, whereas African and Latino families tend
to be involved in practical assistance and housing
support (Berry, 2006; McGarry & Schoeni, 1995).
Regarding bequests, Kao and colleagues (1997)
found that White adults are more likely to expect
an inheritance from their parents than non-Whites.
Whether these racial patterns reflect race differ-
ences in parental financial resources or cultural
differences in preferences or expectations remains
an open question (Berry, 2006).
Current Support Exchanges.--Studies have
often emphasized distinctions between inter-vivos
transfer and bequests and analyzed correlates of
these two types of family transfers separately.
However, current support exchanges may influence
expectations of an inheritance. Put another way, in
forming expectations or plans for bequests, fam-
ily members may draw on their current patterns
of support exchanges (Arrondel & Masson, 2006).
As noted earlier, exchange models suggest that
anticipated inheritance can be rewards for sup-
port or care provided to older parents by children
(i.e., upward exchanges; Bernheim et al., 1985).
However, empirical support for this is mixed.
From the perspective of offspring, sons' expecta-
tions of inheritance were positively associated with
social support provided to their parents, whereas
daughters' expectations of inheritance were nega-
tively associated with support to parents (Caputo,
2002; Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson, 1995). On
the part of parents, Caputo (2005) showed that
parents who have intentions to leave inheritances
to children are more likely to have adult daughters
providing informal care to them. However, Norton
and van Houtven (2006) reported that support
provided by children had no effect on the equality
of parent's intended bequest.
Meanwhile, the effects of downward transfers
(given to children by parents) on bequest intentions
has not received as much attention. McGarry
(1999) found that families providing support to
their children differed in the predictors of intended
bequests from families who were not making inter-
vivos transfers. This suggests that current support
given to children should be taken into account
when examining intended bequests.
Beliefs on Family Obligation.--The economic
literature often infers motives from the behaviors,
ignoring or downplaying cultural and psychologi-
cal factors as important motives for bequest behav-
iors. However, norms of responsibility and family
1022 The Gerontologist
obligation may play an important role in explain-
ing parents' intention and children's expectation
for inheritance (Ikkink, van Tilburg, & Knipscheer,
1999; Kohli & Künemund, 2003). Parental obliga-
tion toward offspring often reflects their altruistic
affection and attention persisting over time, and
filial obligation to provide support to older parents
may include child's reciprocation and gratitude for
support and affection received from parents when
they were young (Silverstein, 2006). Therefore,
filial obligations toward parents may preclude
adult children from having expectations of future
return from parents, though parental obligations
toward children may ensure their intention to
leave bequests.
Control Variables.--We also considered three
demographic characteristics of participants (e.g.,
age, gender, and self-rated health) and geographic
distance between dyadic members as controls.
Given that issues about inheritance may be more
relevant for families in later years, ages of par-
ents and children are likely to influence expecta-
tions over inheritance. Gender of parents may also
affect expectation of inheritances. It is likely that
fathers consider their surviving spouses in making
a plan for bequests, due to gender disparities in life
expectancy (Clignet, 2009). In addition, expecta-
tions of bequests can be affected by parents' health
status because family members may consider pos-
sible medical and long-term care expenses when
older parents are in poor health (Hurd & Smith,
2001). Because proximity constrains provision of
certain types of help, we also included geographic
distance between parents and children (Fingerman
et al., 2011).
In sum, this study takes into account the differ-
ent perspectives of aging parents and adult chil-
dren to explore expectations of inheritance within
family contexts. Utilizing data from 327 dyads
of older parents and their middle-aged children,
we investigated what factors are associated with
expectations of inheritance reported by parents
and children, and if parents' and children's expec-
tations of inheritance are associated with the same
or different factors. In addition, we examined how
parent's intention and child's expectation about
inheritance correspond within dyads and what
factors are associated with patterns of dyadic cor-
respondence. Factors to explain inheritance expec-
tations and dyadic concordance patterns included
economic resources of parents and children (i.e.,
education and income), family characteristics
(i.e., number of siblings and race), current sup-
port exchanges between the dyadic members (i.e.,
upward and downward directions of exchanges),
and beliefs about family obligation.
Methods
Sample
This analysis is based on data from "The family
exchanges study" (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt,
& Zarit, 2009). As a first step in the sampling
procedure, respondents aged 40­60 years who had
at least one living parent and one or more biological
children aged more than 18 years were recruited.
Potential respondents were randomly selected
from phone lists from Genesys Corporation as
well as random digit dialing from the Philadelphia
Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area. Of the
845 eligible targets, 633 (75%) were interviewed
in 2008.
From the original sample of 633 middle-aged
adults, 280 (44%) had parents who also agreed to
be interviewed. In 223 cases, one parent was inter-
viewed, and in 57 cases, both parents were inter-
viewed, which yielded a total of 337 discrete dyads.
In comparison to parents who did not participate
(n = 541), parents who participated (n = 337) were
healthier (t = 4.80, p < .001), younger (t = -3.19, p
< .01), and in a better relationship with their child
(t = 6.19, p < .001).
Because exchanges between the middle-aged
child and his or her mother and father were meas-
ured separately, we considered each parent­child
dyad as a separate unit. The aging parents were
asked a set of questions that were identical to those
for their children. Excluded were dyads who did
not have reports from both dyadic members on
our main variable (n = 10), so that the final sample
was 327 parent­child dyads (individual N = 600).
Table 1 presents background information of the
sample.
Measures
Expectation of Inheritance.--Our dependent
variable was expectation of leaving a bequest or
receiving an inheritance. Thus, we measured the
views of parents and children on the same future
event within the family. Older parents answered
yes or no to whether they intend to leave an inher-
itance for their child. Adult children also answered
Vol. 53, No. 6, 2013 1023
yes or no to whether they expect to receive an
inheritance from their parent (see Table 2).
Independent Variables
Economic Resources.--As indicators of eco-
nomic resources, we used household income and
education of each parent and child. Participants
reported household income in 2007 on a 6-point
scale ranged from 1 (<$10,000) to 6 (>$100,000;
McGarry & Schoeni, 1997), and they also pro-
vided their years of education.
Family Characteristics.--Regarding family char-
acteristics of parent­child dyads, family size was
measured by the number of siblings that adult chil-
dren have. Race was dichotomized: White families
were coded 1 and racial minority families were
coded 0. The vast majority of these families were
African American (78.4%).
Current Support Exchanges.--We assessed sup-
port that children provided to their parents (i.e.,
upward exchanges) and support that parents pro-
vided to their children (i.e., downward exchanges).
Using the Intergenerational Support Scale (ISS;
Fingerman et al., 2009), we measured how often
participants provided and received six types of
support (emotional support, practical assistance,
advice, socializing, financial support, and listening
to talk about daily events) on an 8-point scale
ranged from 1 (less than once a year or not at all)
to 8 (daily). We calculated mean scores across the
six types of support. Because we have both chil-
dren's and parents reports of support exchanged
with their dyadic partner, we used average scores
of parents' and children's reports to represent each
direction of support exchanges between them
( = 0.85 for downward support;  = 0.86 for
upward support).
Family Obligation.--For norms of family obli-
gation, parents were asked how often parents
should provide offspring with six types of support
(emotional support, practical assistance, listening
to the other's talk, socializing, advice, and finan-
cial support), and children indicated how often
they thought children should provide such support
to their parents. This assessment was based on

approaches used in prior studies (Silverstein, Gans,
& Yang, 2006). The answers ranged from 1 (never)
to 5 (always). Means of the six items were com-
puted ( = 0.67 for parents;  = 0.79 for children).
Control Variables.--Three demographic char-
acteristics of parents and children (e.g., age, gen-
der, and self-rated health) and geographic distance
between dyadic members were included as control
variables. Participants provided their chronologi-
cal age. Gender was coded 1 for male and 0 for
female. Self-rated health for the past 12 months
was measured using a 5-point scale ranging from
1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Geographic distance
between parents' and noncoresident children's res-
idences was measured in miles. To address positive
skew of distance, we used a log­linear transforma-
tion in the analyses.
Analysis Plan
Question 1.--Dyadic data represents a special
case of hierarchically clustered data, with individu-
als nested within dyads. To account for the interde-
pendence of individuals within each dyad, we used
multilevel models (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006;
Sayer & Klute, 2005). Because the dependent vari-
able of this study is a dichotomous variable (yij
= 1
or 0), we employed SAS PROC NLMIXED pro-
cedure, which transformed the binary dependent
variable into the probability of the response, using
a logit link function (Guo & Zhao, 2000):
h

p
p
=
-










log
( )
1
where pij
is the probability of observing the
response, yij
(e.g., expected or not inheritances),
and ij
is the log-odds of observing the response.
Based on the link function, multilevel models were
specified as follows:
Level 1: ij
= 0j
+ 1j
(Generationij
)
Level 2: 0j
= 00
+ 01j
Wqj
+ u0j
1j
= 10
+ 11j
Wqj
At Level 1, the multilevel model includes only
the distinguishing variable within dyads, genera-
tion (coded 0 for parents and 1 for children), as
a predictor (Model 1). The intercept 0j
represents
the expected inheritance probability for indi-
viduals in dyad j whose generation is equal to 0
(i.e., parents). The slope 1j
represents effects of
generation on the probability of inheritance. Here,
it should be noted that the Level 1 equation does
not have an error term, due to the nature of dyadic
data with binary dependent variables (McMahon,
Pouget, & Tortu, 2006).
At Level 2, we examined the effects of four
sets of predictors, Wqj
to explain the variation of
the intercept (0j
, overall inheritance probabil-
ity within dyads) and slope coefficients (1j
, gen-
erational differences in inheritance probability
within dyads) across dyads. Thus, predictors for
the intercept show factors affecting expectations
on inheritance commonly for parents and children
(Model 2), whereas predictors for the slope reveal
if the effect of each factor is the same or different
between parents and children, which is a form of
interaction with the distinguishing variable (Model
3). We presented the significant interaction terms,
trimming insignificant interaction terms for par-
simoniousness of model. Given that inclusion of
random slope variance for dyadic data with only
two observations per cluster can cause convergence
problems (McMahon et al., 2006), we included
only the random intercept for the Level 2 model.
Question 2.--To examine dyadic correspond-
ence on inheritance expectations, we looked at the
proportion of four groups based on the answers of
parent and offspring within dyads (Table 2): two
correspondent dyads ("yes­yes" or "no­no") and
two discordant dyads ("yes­no" and "no­yes").
First, a McNemar test was used to examine an
effect of generation in the percentage of parents
and children who expected an inheritance (Kenny
et al., 2006). Second, to investigate factors related
to patterns of the dyadic concordance on inherit-
ance expectations, we conducted a logistic regres-
sion analysis (e.g., concordant dyads vs. discordant
dyads), including the same sets of predictors as in
Question 1.
Results
Factors Predicting Inheritance Expectations
The first question of this study was to exam-
ine factors that predict inheritance expectations
reported by aging parents and their adult chil-
dren (Table 3). As an initial step, we included only
the distinguishing variable (i.e., parent or child),
which estimates generational differences in dyadic
reports of the inheritance expectations (Model 1).
Generation showed a significant negative effect
Vol. 53, No. 6, 2013 1025
on inheritance expectations, indicating that chil-
dren were less likely to expect receiving an inher-
itance than parents intended to leave a bequest
(OR = 0.07). The significant random effect for
intercept indicated that there is substantial unex-
plained variance in the outcome variable, and
Level 2 predictors could be added to the model.
Next, we added four sets of predictors to the
model to explain between-dyad variability in the
overall probability of expected inheritance (main
effect model; Model 2). Regarding economic
resources, only parents' income was significant in
a positive direction, suggesting that dyads in which
parents had higher levels of income are more likely
to expect inheritances. None of offspring's eco-
nomic resources were significant. Among family
characteristics, number of siblings was negatively
associated with bequest probability, indicating that
having more siblings is associated with the lower
expectations of inheritance. Race did not show a
significant effect on the inheritance expectations.
Among the estimates of current exchanges of sup-
port, downward exchanges were positively associ-
ated with expectations of inheritance. Thus, dyads
where parents are currently giving more support
to children showed higher probability of expected
inheritance. Upward exchanges (i.e., support given
to parents) had no effect. Finally, we found no
effects of parents' or offspring's beliefs about fam-
ily obligation on expectations of inheritance.
We then turned to the interactions with gen-
eration to look at whether the four sets of factors
are associated with expectations on inheritance
in the same or different ways for each generation

(interaction effect model; Model 3). We found
significant interaction effects with generation for
three factors: child's income, upward exchanges,
and parents' gender. Specifically, when children
had higher levels of income, they were less likely to
expect to receive an inheritance, whereas their par-
ents were more likely to intend to leave one. In the
dyads where children were providing more sup-
port to parents, children were less likely to expect
to receive an inheritance, whereas their parents
were more likely to expect leaving one. Finally,
when the parent is a father, children were less
likely to expect to receive an inheritance, whereas
fathers were more likely to have intentions to leave
an inheritance. After entering the interaction terms
of these factors, the effect of generation was no
longer significant.
Dyadic Correspondence in Expectations of
Inheritance
To address the second question about the
dyadic correspondence, we first looked at the pro-
portion of the four groups formed from parents'
and children's dichotomous answers (see Table 2).
As observed in the previous analysis, parents
were more likely than their offspring to expect an
inheritance (McNemar 2 (1) = 105.69, p < .001).
About a half of the dyads (53.5%) agreed regard-
ing expectations of inheritance and the other half
(46.5%) disagreed. Among correspondent dyads,
more dyads answered "yes" (78.9%) than when
both members of the dyad answered"no"(21.1%).
For discordant dyads, the most common pattern of
discordance was for parents to say that they will
leave a bequest, but for their adult children to say
they do not expect an inheritance. In contrast, it
was very rare (5.3%) that parents say they would
not leave an inheritance but for their children to
expect to receive an inheritance.
To examine predictors associated with the
dyadic concordance patterns on inheritance prob-
ability, we chose the two largest groups: "yes
(parent)­yes (child)" dyads (n = 138) as a corre-
spondent pattern and "yes (parent)­no (child)"
dyads (n = 144) as a discordant pattern. We
decided not to combine groups or compare all four
groups separately, considering the small sample
sizes of some groups and different characteristics
of each group. We coded correspondent dyads 1
and discordant dyads 0. Table 4 shows the results
of the logistic regression analysis to explain the
differences between correspondent and discordant
dyads. Correspondent dyads where both parents
and children answered "yes" showed higher levels
of parents' income and support given from parents
to children. They also showed lower levels of chil-
dren's income and lower levels of children's obli-
gation, compared with discordant dyads, in which
parents intended to leave a bequest but their chil-
dren did not expect an inheritance.
Discussion
Findings of this study showed a significant dif-
ference in the expectations of inheritance between
older parents and adult offspring. Specifically, in
many families, adult children were less likely to
expect to receive an inheritance than their parents
intended to leave one. Thus, discrepant expecta-
tions over inheritance between generations suggest
that inheritance issues are a substantially hid-
den agenda, even within older families. The fact
that parents were more likely to expect to give a
bequest than offspring expected to receive one may
also reflect their psychological investment or stake
in assuring the welfare of their children (Giarrusso,
Feng, & Bengtson, 2004). In terms of the potential
for conflict around inheritance, lower expectations
of offspring about future inheritance may be less
destructive following the parent's death than the
opposite direction of differences (e.g., expectations
of children are higher than parents' intentions).
However, given that expectations surrounding
inheritance can affect attitudes and behaviors
regarding the inter-vivos support between parents
and offspring, future studies are needed to exam-
ine how these generational differences in expecta-
tions affect support exchanges over time.
We examined four sets of predictors for the
bequest expectations: economic resources, fam-
ily characteristics, current support exchanges, and
beliefs about family obligation. Among economic
resources, only parent's income was positively
associated with expectations on inheritance. This
result is consistent with prior studies suggesting
that bequest probability was not sensitive to chil-
dren's characteristics, although parents are likely
to respond to financial needs of children through
immediate inter-vivos transfers (McGarry, 1999).
Regarding family characteristics, when there were
more children in the family, both members of the
dyad were less likely to expect bequests.Again, this
finding is consistent with prior studies suggesting
the depletion of resources when there are more
children (Fingerman et al., 2009; Schoeni, 1997).
Vol. 53, No. 6, 2013 1027
Also, interestingly, we found that current sup-
port given to a child had positive effects on inher-
itance expectations, whereas support given to a
parent was not significant. This result seems to be
contrary to the exchange hypothesis, which states
that bequests can be a compensation for the sup-
port given to parents by children. Rather, it appears
that when more parental support is given to a child,
the dyads are more likely to expect an inheritance.
This result suggests a continuity of intergenera-
tional transfers as part of the same decision-mak-
ing process leading to a bequest (McGarry, 1999).
Given the overwhelmingly asymmetric downward
direction of intergenerational transfers (from the
upper to lower generations) over the life spans
of both parents and children, adult families may
repeat their established transfer patterns based
on parents' altruism in their final transfers, rather
than based on reciprocity (Arrondel & Masson,
2006). In addition, current downward support
may reflect offspring's needs for parental sup-
port because inter-vivos transfers tend to be made
in response to child's needs. Although variables
regarding children's economic resources did not
show significant effects on inheritance expectation,
the findings about downward exchanges may be
because of other needs, such as emotional support
or practical assistance.
Besides those factors commonly affecting
bequest expectations for parents and children, we
also found that child's income, upward exchanges,
and parent's gender had significant interactions
with generation.Thus, in forming one's own expec-
tations over inheritance, parents and offspring
appear to be influenced by these factors in dif-
ferent ways. Given that generation was no longer
significant after entering the interaction terms, the
differential effects of those factors appear to con-
tribute to the generational differences observed in
the probability of expected inheritance.
Although child's income and child-to-parent sup-
port have been emphasized as the main variables
to reveal the bequest motives, these two factors
showed differential effects by generation. The fact
that prior studies did not show consistent evidence
about the effects of these variables on the bequest
behaviors may be related to the differential effects
of these variables within families. Regarding chil-
dren' income, children who had higher levels of
income were less likely to expect an inheritance

than parents intended. Thus, children appear to
consider their own financial situation in forming
expectations about inheritance, whereas parents
plan for bequest regardless of children's income. In
addition, when children are providing more help to
their parents, children were less likely to expect to
receive an inheritance than the likelihood their par-
ents intended to leave a bequest. Contrary to the
exchange hypothesis, if helping parents is caused by
parents' needs and limited resources, it is less likely
for children to expect to receive an inheritance from
parents. Caputo (2002) indicated that for adult
children, providing support to aging parents may be
driven by needs of parents and filial responsibility,
rather than expectations of future reciprocity on the
part of their parents. Thus, the differential effects
of these two variables may reflect issues about off-
spring's resources. Offspring with more resources
may be less likely to expect inheritance as well as
more likely to provide support to their parents.
In addition, we found interaction effects of par-
ent's gender with generation on the inheritance
expectations, although gender was not a main
predictor. Children were less likely to expect to
receive an inheritance from fathers. Given gen-
der disparities in life expectancy, it may be that
children consider that fathers' bequests are most
likely to go to their wives, who would be expected
to survive longer than fathers (Clignet, 2009).
There was a surprising amount of discordance
between parent's intention and child's expectation
of an inheritance, with about a half of the dyads
disagreeing. The most common pattern of discord-
ance was that children do not expect to receive an
inheritance, but their parents have the intention of
leaving a bequest, whereas the most common pat-
tern of concordance was that both parents and chil-
dren expected an inheritance. Because the majority
of parents (86%) expressed their bequest inten-
tions, the dyadic correspondence patterns tended
to be distinguished by whether children also had
expectations on inheritance. Our logistic regres-
sion analysis of the two largest groups ("yes­yes"
vs. "yes­no") found that parent's income, child's
income, downward exchanges, and child's filial
obligation explained differences between the two
patterns. Given that parents showed their inten-
tion to leave a bequest in both groups we com-
pared, our analysis, in effect, can be interpreted as
identifying predictors for children's expectations
on inheritance when their parents have bequest
intentions. First, regarding economic resources,
when parents reported higher income and children
reported lower income, children are more likely
to expect an inheritance, which results in corre-
spondence with parents' intention in their expec-
tations. Unlike parents who tend to follow the
equal division rule, children seem to consider their
own economic status as well as parent's financial
availability in their expectations over inheritances.
Second, when children are receiving more support
from parents, they are likely to expect an inher-
itance. Again, given that inheritance issues might
be an implicit agenda within families, current sup-
port received from parent may provide a basis for
children's expectations of the future inheritance.
Finally, children with strong feelings of obligation
toward parent were less likely to expect an inher-
itance. Because filial obligation reflects normative
beliefs that children are obligated to take responsi-
bility for their aging parents without expectations
for anything in return, offspring with stronger
beliefs about filial obligation may not be concerned
with future bequests.
This study also has limitations. First, though the
use of information from multiple reporters offers
a unique opportunity to look at the correspond-
ence of the bequest expectations between parents
and children, the parents who agreed to partici-
pate in this survey were different than parents who
did not participate, in terms of socioeconomic sta-
tus, health, and relationship quality. Second, we
focused on parent­child dyads, but information on
other family members (e.g., siblings) can be impor-
tant beyond the dyad. Third, we used household
income and education as indicators of each genera-
tion's economic situation. However, assets, savings,
and debt should also be taken into account. Fourth,
due to the nature of a binary dependent variable,we
could not apply three-level models to deal with the
shared variance within family for the 57 cases with
reports about both mother and father. Fifth, we
only compared the two groups where parents have
inheritance intentions in predicting dyadic corre-
spondence of inheritance expectation. However,
given cultural expectation that parents will leave
an inheritance to their offspring, it may be more
interesting to examine situations under which par-
ents will not leave an inheritance to their children.
Finally, we do not have expectations on how much
parents intend to bequest and how much children
expect to receive. It would be interesting to exam-
ine the extent of concordance around the amount
of inheritance, as well as to consider how much
parents and children have discussed inheritance
with one another.

These findings showing discrepancies between
parents and their middle-aged children in their
expectation over inheritance emphasize the impor-
tance of understanding different perspectives from
family members in intergenerational transfers. The
discrepancies appear to reflect systematic differ-
ences in the way that parents and children form
their intention or expectation about inheritance.
Although concordance in expectations is not neces-
sary for positive quality parent­offspring relation-
ships, discordance in these expectations could lead
to conflict over inheritance issues. More detailed
information, however, on factors such as amount
of expected inheritance and how the inheritance
is being divided among family members would be
needed to tease out the full implications of disa-
greement. Given the increasing diversity of families
and the weakness of cultural norms surrounding
family life, misunderstandings between the genera-
tions about these issues are likely to become more
common.
