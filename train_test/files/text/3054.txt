The US has been very successful in lowering the overall unem-
ployment rate to 5.3%,1 but the context of unemployment
has changed considerably within the last 15 years, and this
adjustment can have long-term consequences. Of the full-time
workers who lost their jobs and found new employment in the
US, about a third suffered earning losses of 20% and took up
jobs without health insurance benefits.2
The health effects of economic insecurity have been widely
analysed, and we have important evidence on the mental and
overall health effects of unemployment.3­9 An increase in
depression symptoms, substance abuse, admissions to psychiatric
hospitals, death by suicide, and violence are among the most
salient outcomes associated with unemployment.10­14 The
evidence is inconclusive regarding other health outcomes. In
addition, people in poorer health are more likely to lose their
jobs and people in better health are more likely to be re-
employed.15­17 Comprehensive reviews discussing these find-
ings are readily available.18,19
There is also an extensive literature on the impact of adverse
working conditions on health; while most of the research in this
area of inquiry started by focusing on men's work,20,21 a grow-
ing number of studies are now including women.22,23 It has
been noted that that for women combining paid work with
responsibilities related to home and family reduces the well-
being benefits of employment.24,25
There has been some work on the impact of the interactions
between unemployment levels and job conditions on the psy-
chological distress of workers,26 but very rarely are different
working situations and unemployment studied simultaneously
using individual level data. In addition, the impact of public
assistance in ameliorating the effects of unemployment on per-
ceived physical illness has rarely been addressed.27­29

Do social programmes contribute to
mental well-being? The long-term impact
of unemployment on depression in the
United States
Eunice Rodriguez,a Edward A Frongillob and Pinky Chandrac
Background Important evidence about the mental health effects of unemployment exist;
however, little is known about the possible protective effects of various social
interventions or about their long-term impact. This study examines the long-
term consequences that different types of social programmes, i.e. entitlement and
means-tested benefits, might have as regards ameliorating a negative mental
health impact of unemployment among women and men.
Methods Multiple regression models were used to analyse panel data collected in the
National Survey of Families and Households in 1987 and 1992. In all 8029
individuals interviewed in both 1987 and 1992 were included in the analysis. A
depression index was created from the responses to 15 items from the Center for
Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale-D (CES-D) which were included in the
survey.
Results The receipt of government entitlement benefits by unemployed women is
associated with a reduction of depression symptoms in the long term. Men and
women not working and receiving means-tested or welfare benefits are more
likely to report depression in both the short and long term.
Conclusions The study underscores the need for monitoring the impact of welfare reform on
mental health.

Objectives
Our objective is to assess the long-term effects of unemployment
on depression symptoms. What is unique about this study is
that we explore the possible impact that different social pro-
grammes, such as entitlement unemployment benefits or means-
tested welfare schemes could have with respect to ameliorating
a possible negative mental health impact among the unem-
ployed, as well as the fact that we are able to look at different
employment arrangements simultaneously.
Our hypothesis is that economic hardship is only one of the
effects associated with being without a job.30 Unemployment
may have additional psychological and sociological costs that
could be mitigated by different activities and programmes of
social support in addition to the provision of economic relief.
We argue that in order to have a protective effect on mental
health, social support should not only consist of adequate
economic assistance, but should simultaneously seek to
alleviate the additional sociological and psychological impact of
unemployment.
The importance of social support in protecting health has
been widely documented since the publication of a compre-
hensive review by Cassel in 1976.31 In addition, recent research
indicates that `the actual social environment is not the source of
some protective factors for mental health; instead, what may
be more important is how the environment is perceived'
(p.395),32 and that the effect of perceived support is not always
mediated by actual supportive behaviours.33 While the social
environment can be the source of adverse health outcomes, the
way social support is perceived could be a key factor in
benefiting from its health protective effects.
In a previous study it was found that the type of unem-
ployment benefits received played a role in modifying the
impact of unemployment on symptoms of depression,12 but
the nature of the cross-sectional analysis carried out precluded
the possibility of assessing whether the observed differences
were due to the impact of the different benefit programmes
or to a selection process. By using longitudinal data, we are able
to further explore the possible differences between unemployed
groups in relation to full-time employed, and to better under-
stand how men and women are affected in different ways.
Methods
We analysed panel data collected in the National Survey of
Families and Households (NSFH) 1987­1992. The 1987 NSFH
study consisted of interviews with 13 014 respondents, of
whom 10 008 were re-interviewed in 1992­1993. This repres-
ents an attrition rate of 23%. We analysed possible differences
between respondents to the 1992 survey and those who were
lost to follow-up after the 1987 interview. There were no
significant differences in attrition rates by gender, age, ethnic
group, and marital status between those who were re-
interviewed and those lost to follow-up.
We limited our analysis to those respondents who were aged
between 17 and 65 in 1987 and who were re-interviewed in
1992­1993. The total number of respondents included in the
analysis was 7536.
As the outcome measure, we used a depression index created
from the responses to 15 items from the Center for Epidemio-
logical Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D) which were included
in the survey. The 15 CES-D items are described in Appendix 1.
The index of depression ranged from 0 to 105, and we trans-
formed it to log (depression + 0.05) to better fit the assumptions
of multiple regression analyses. The mean (and standard devia-
tion) of the untransformed and transformed index were 16.89
(18.52) and 2.23 (1.29), respectively. The transformation changed
the skewness from 1.84 to ­0.69, and made the distribution
symmetric with the mean in the middle of the range of ­0.693
and 4.66. An advantage of the log transformation is that the
regression coefficients that result from the analysis can be back-
transformed to yield an interpretation of how many times
higher or lower is the depression index for one group compared
to another.
An employment situation variable was constructed from
several variables asking about the respondents' employment.
Employed respondents in 1987 were divided into full- and
part-time employed, depending on whether they worked 30,
or 29 h a week. For the 1992 interviews, we divided the
employed population into two additional categories according
to whether or not they were satisfied with their jobs. Satis-
faction with 1992 employment reflects the perception of the
individual, and could be due to a variety of both structural and
personal factors (e.g. level of benefits, schedule, friendliness of
supervisors of co-workers).
In addition, we differentiated those working people who were
simultaneously receiving welfare benefits (i.e. means-tested or
public assistance), and followed the same strategy. Males work-
ing and receiving welfare could not be included in the analysis
because of the insignificant number involved.
Non-employed individuals looking for work during the
4 weeks prior to the interview, and those not actively looking
for work were separated into two categories. These two groups
were then further divided into three categories: (1) people
receiving public assistance in the form of welfare or means-
tested benefits; (2) people receiving income from government
entitlement benefit programmes (including veterans' benefits,
unemployment compensation, and worker's compensation),
and (3) people not receiving any type of income or economic
assistance. This last group of non-working people is difficult to
interpret; it could include both people out of the labour force
by choice, and unemployed people who have given up looking
for work. Of these, we do not know how many are housewives
by choice, students, or simply discouraged unemployed not
eligible for any kind of benefits. There was no question
included in the survey that allowed us to differentiate between
these three groups of people included in the same category of
non-employed and not looking for work without receiving
any benefits.
Those who were fully retired in 1992 were grouped in a
separate category. The typology of employment situation was
operationalized as dummy variables.
Statistical analysis
We ran three different multiple regression models to explain
depression. First, we analysed the possible impact of 1987
employment status and receipt of benefits on 1992 depression,
while controlling for age, race, 1987 years of education, 1987
index of depression, and two measures of social support
(number of social contacts, and having someone to call in an
emergency in 1987).
164 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
Second, we added other 1992 factors to the model, including
years of education in 1992, marital status, family income, assets
and debts, having a physical or mental limitation that would
restrict the ability to work, number of weeks unemployed
during the year before the second interview (i.e. 1991), fre-
quency of social contacts, satisfaction with personal relations,
and environmental variables such as unemployment rate in the
State of residence and amount of unemployment benefit
available per unemployed person in the relevant State. Third,
we added employment situation in 1992 to create a full model
that allowed us to assess the impact of current employment
status on depression while controlling for 1987 employment.
We used a Box-Cox transformation of the income, assets and
debts variables to reduce skewness of these variables. The
optimal transformations were found by doing a grid search over
possible values of the Box-Cox shape parameter. The appro-
priate regression diagnostic tests were performed to assess the fit
of the model. We did not impute any missing values in the
dependent variable. For the categorical independent variables,
we added an option of `no response' where necessary. The
income, assets and debts variables were complex, comprised of
many components. If a component was missing, we imputed
the values deterministically with the predicted values estimated
for the age, sex, ethnic, marital and occupational group of the
respondent. Preliminary analyses indicated that results were not
sensitive to the inclusion of these imputed values.
To control for a possible reverse causation effect, we included
in our model previous measures of depression and employ-
ment history.
Results
Table 1 presents a description of our sample according to
employment status and reported level of depression in 1992.
Consistent with the literature, women report higher levels
of depression symptoms than men. The main similarities
between men and women are the lower levels of depression
indicators among respondents who are full- or part-time
employed and satisfied with their jobs, and those who are fully
retired. All respondents report higher indices of depression if
they were unemployed and receiving welfare (i.e. means-tested)
benefits.
Table 2 presents the results of our multiple regression analysis
to assess the impact of 1987 employment status on 1992 symp-
toms of depression. As observed in Table 2, the important
factors in explaining less symptoms of depression include age
and years of education. Index of depression previously reported
in 1987 is strongly related to depression in 1992. Differences
between men and women include frequency of social contacts
being negatively associated with depression only among men.
Race other than white or African American is associated with
the depression outcome only among women.

b These groups were not included in the regression analysis due to small number of observations in these categories.
In comparison with full-time workers, women not working,
not looking for work, and not receiving any social benefits in
1987 (i.e. mostly housewives) report a lower index of depres-
sion in 1992; their index of depression is 1.1 times (i.e. 10%)
lower. A similar association is observed among unemployed
women who were looking for work while receiving govern-
ment (entitlement) benefits in 1987, although the confidence
interval for the effect is relatively large; these women have a
depression index that is 2.2 times lower than that of the
reference group. In contrast, women who were not working
while receiving welfare (means-tested) benefits in 1987 are
significantly more likely to report depression in 1992; they have
an index of depression that is 1.3 times higher.
Men have a different pattern than women with regard to the
association of employment status and depression. Only those
who were working part-time in 1987 report less symptoms of
depression in 1992 than full-time workers. No other important
differences are observed among the other employment groups.
When the 1992 explanatory variables are added to the regres-
sion model for women (Table 3, column 2), the only 1987 em-
ployment categories that remain inversely associated with 1992
depression are those of unemployed people receiving government
benefits. In addition, an inverse association is observed among un-
employed women who were not looking for work while receiv-
ing government benefits in 1987. For men (Table 3, column 2),
we observe the same association as in our reduced model: those
who were working part-time in 1987 report less symptoms of
depression in 1992. The same effects remain when we add 1992
employment status to the model (Table 3, Columns 3 and 4).
Women who were not satisfied with their job in 1992 report
more symptoms of depression than those who were satisfied.
Among non-working women, only those who were unemployed,
not looking for work, and receiving welfare benefits are more
likely to report depression than the comparison group. Men
working full-time but not satisfied with their jobs are more
depressed than those who were satisfied, and among the
unemployed men only those looking for work while receiving
government benefits report more depression.
Factors strongly related to depression in 1992, for men
and women alike, are having a physical or mental condition
that could limit ability to work in 1992, and the respondents'
baseline 1987 index of depression (Table 3). Total family assets,

satisfaction with personal relationships (family, friends, etc.),
and age are associated with lower depression for both groups. In
contrast, greater frequency of social contacts is associated with
more symptoms of depression.
Some of the most notable differences between men and
women include the impact of debts, and marital status. While
being divorced, widowed or separated is significantly related to
depression among females, never having been married is what
is significantly related to depression among men. Once we
control for 1992 employment status in our model, the impact of
years of education is no longer significant among women. In
addition to total family assets, for women the amount of accu-
mulated debt is also significantly related to depression. In
addition, the number of weeks that respondents were unem-
ployed and looking for work during the previous year (i.e.
1991) is significantly related to depression among men only.
Discussion
Limitations
For researchers concerned with the dynamics at work between
social issues and health, going beyond the modelling of complex
relationships among risk factors and focusing on an under-
standing of their origins and implications are significant
challenges. Our study confirms the need to look at men and
women separately.
We attenuated the effects of reverse causation by using
prospective longitudinal data. We controlled both for having
any physical or mental condition that would limit the ability to
work for pay in 1992, and the previous index of depression.
However, unemployed people receiving benefits differ in many
ways from people not receiving benefits, and these differences
may not be fully controlled for by the background covariates
used in our analysis. Our exclusion criteria and the factors con-
trolled for in our models should have eliminated most of the
differences between the various groups of unemployed people,
but uncontrolled variables determining both unemployment
resources and health outcomes may still have existed.
One of the difficulties in a longitudinal study is that cases are
subject to attrition over time.34 Many variables expected to be
related to drop-out status were included in the regression
model, and the per cent of respondents lost to follow-up in
1992 was similar across employment categories, with the
exception of those unemployed actively looking for work and
receiving welfare or no benefits at all in 1987. Among those
groups, the attrition rate was close to 30%. It is plausible that
unemployed people actively looking for work had a higher
probability of changing residencies and relocating, and
consequently a higher probability of being lost to follow-up.
Main findings and implications
One of the most interesting findings is to see a direct effect of
1987 unemployment on 1992 depression for women who
were receiving government, i.e. entitlement, benefits in 1987.
Even after incorporating 1992 variables in the regression
model, unemployed women who were receiving entitlement
benefits in 1987 report less symptoms of depression than those
who were full-time employed. This finding gives support to
the hypothesis that the receipt of entitlement government
assistance may have a long-term protective effect on unem-
ployed women, and confirms previous findings using cross-
sectional data.
On the contrary, being unemployed and receiving means-
tested benefits in 1987 is strongly related to depression in 1992.
However, the effect is reduced when we include 1992 variables

in the model. Not working while receiving welfare in 1992 has
a direct effect on increasing symptoms of depression among
women. One possible explanation is that the amount of welfare
benefits provided is insufficient to positively influence mental
health. However, given that we control for family income and
wealth, other factors are more likely to be responsible for
the difference. Social stigma and/or some other factors in the
process associated with receiving welfare benefits could add
additional stress to the lives of the recipients, which could offset
some of the positive impact of welfare or other means-tested
benefits. Previous research has shown the importance of per-
ception in mediating the effect of supportive events, and how
those perceptions influence the coping processes of individuals.
In any case, the 1992 employment situation is more important
in having an impact on depression than the fact of having been
on welfare 5 years earlier.
Previous research has found an association between length of
unemployment periods and depression. In our model the num-
ber of weeks unemployed during 1991­1992 does not have a
direct effect on depression among women, but it has some effect
on decreasing symptoms of depression among men.
In our full regression model unemployed men who were
looking for work while receiving government benefits are more
likely to report symptoms of depression than the employed.
This could be due to the fact that government unemployment
benefits are usually short-term subsidies, and depression could
be higher during the initial period of the unemployment.
Men on welfare report three times more symptoms of
depression than those employed and satisfied with their jobs
(Table 1), and the lack of a direct impact on depression in our
regression model is probably due to a small sample effect.
In this study we have been able to confirm simultaneously
the significant impact that both economic and emotional
resources of the family have in explaining depression, for men
and women alike. Interestingly, total family income is not a
significant factor once family assets and debts are included in
the model, which suggests that those indicators could be better
measures of wealth.
The effects of unemployment on depression depend upon
gender and upon participation in governmental assistance
programmes in a complex way. Continuing to develop an
understanding of these effects will be increasingly important as
rapid and substantial changes are made in the structure of
employment and governmental assistance for those not
employed.

IMPACT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON DEPRESSION 169
Using baseline (1987) and follow-up (1992) data from the
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH),
Rodriguez et al. set out to examine the long-term consequences
of different types of government benefit on the negative mental
health impact of unemployment.1 The NSFH is a rich dataset
which has enabled the authors to look at the short- and long-
term effects of employment status and receipt of benefit, while
controlling for depression score at baseline and numerous other
factors that have been shown to be associated with employment
status and depression, such as debt and social support. Research
of this nature is important as few studies have explicitly
examined the effects of government benefits on health
outcomes using individual data.
The paper presents numerous findings, of which the authors
choose to highlight the beneficial long-term effect of statutory
benefits for mental health in unemployed women and the
adverse short- and long-term effects of means-tested benefits
in women who are non-employed, compared to women in full-
time employment.
As many studies have convincingly linked the health effects
of unemployment directly to financial problems2,3 the ex-
planation of these findings which springs to mind is that means-
tested benefits provide insufficient income to maintain mental
health. However, the analyses are controlled for household
income, assets and debts as well as measures of social support.

Appendix
Index of depression
The variable index of depression was created by adding the
15 Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale-D
(CES-D) items variables included in the National Survey of
Families and Households. These variables represent a list
of ways one might have felt or behaved during the past week.
The questions ask on how many days during the past week did you:
1. feel bothered by things that usually don't bother you?
2. not feeling like eating; appetite was poor?
3. feel that you could not shake off the blues even with help
from family or friends?
4. have trouble keeping your mind on what you were doing?
5. feel depressed?
6. feel that everything you did was an effort?
7. feel fearful?
8. feel restlessly?
9. talk less than usual?
10. feel lonely?
11. feel sad?
12. feel you could not get going?
13. feel irritable, or likely to fight or argue?
14. feel like telling someone off?
15. feel angry or hostile for several hours at a time?

The authors conclude that `social stigma and/or some other
factors in the process associated with receiving welfare benefits
could add additional stress to the lives of the recipients...'. Such
effects were widely documented in England in the 1930s de-
pression4,5 and again in the 1980s.6,7 However, these accounts
also provide a very vivid picture of the economic hardship result-
ing from dependency on means-tested benefits. The corrosive
effect of this hardship is experienced directly via limited access to
consumer goods and indirectly through social exclusion.8 It thus
seems likely that, in this population also, unrecorded material
disadvantage, such as poor quality, overcrowded housing,9 or
access to adequate services,10 makes a substantial contribution
to the mental health differences between women in full-time
employment and those on means-tested benefits. Findings from
other epidemiological studies indicate that financial strain, which
is particularly associated with long-term unemployment, has
adverse effects on mental health.11,12
More surprising than the generally adverse associations be-
tween receipt of means-tested benefit and mental health are the
apparently salutogenic long-term effects of statutory benefits for
women. Statutory benefits are usually paid for a limited period
and are dependent on having been in employment for a con-
siderable period prior to job loss. Thus it is likely that these
women had only been unemployed for a short time before
the 1987 data collection. It is generally accepted that recent
unemployment is associated with the steepest decline in mental
health,13 although there is evidence that some improvement in
mental health may occur immediately post-redundancy when
job loss has been preceded by a period of uncertainty.14 How-
ever, the 14 women in this category have a depression index
in 1992, 2.2 times lower than women in full-time employment.
This salutogenic effect remains after controlling for 1992 age,
education, marital status, race, limiting physical or mental
illness, household characteristics including income and wealth,
social support, job search history and environmental factors,
and employment status, as well as index of depression and social
support in 1987. However, the 37 women not working and
not looking for a job but on statutory benefits in 1987, similarly
have significantly lower depression scores at follow-up,
although in the fully-adjusted model the difference is no longer
significant. These findings lead to the conclusion that either
these were exceptional women or that full-time employment
has an adverse impact on mental health in certain women.
Domestic responsibilities and caring have been shown to be im-
portant determinants of women's self-reported morbidity.15,16
Thus, for women who have been shouldering the burden of
domestic responsibilities and caring in addition to full-time em-
ployment, a period of being at home on statutory benefits might
well have positive implications for mental health. Furthermore,
women's resilience to job loss is thought to be greater than
men's because they have these alternative roles from which
they derive a sense of self-worth.17
The other consistent conclusion to come out of the study, that
part-time work has significant long-term benefits for men, also
appears to support the argument that full-time employment
has adverse effects on the mental health of some workers. The
Second European Survey of Working Conditions found part-
time and temporary workers to have significantly lower levels
of stress than permanent full-time employees.18 One reason for
this may lie in the work intensification which has accompanied
the downsizing of workforces over the past two decades. The
expectation that surviving workers expand their skills and
responsibilities to cover for those dismissed has increased work
pressures, which in turn have been shown to have adverse
effects on mental health.19
When respondents in employment in 1992 are split by job
satisfaction a clearer picture of the mental health damaging
effects of unsatisfactory work are seen. Unsatisfactory full-time
employment is associated with significantly higher depression
scores for both sexes, as is unsatisfactory part-time employment
in women. Dissatisfaction with employment can be due to many
factors, but there is evidence that people most vulnerable to
unemployment are also those most likely to be in poor quality
insecure jobs.20
In general, both population and redundancy studies have
found job insecurity and threat of job loss to be related to
significant increases in mental ill-health.21,22 These effects are
not transitory, but are increased by chronic exposure to the
stressor.19,23 Robust evidence of the effect of insecure employ-
ment on psychological morbidity has come from a longitudinal
study of white-collar British civil servants, the Whitehall II study.
In analyses adjusted for age, socioeconomic position, marital
status and pre-existing morbidity, women and men re-employed
in insecure jobs after losing long-term secure employment in
the Civil Service had significantly higher levels of mental ill-
health than those able to find secure jobs.24 These findings com-
plement those from other studies. Unsatisfactory re-employment
following factory closure among male steel workers25 and car
workers26 has been shown significantly to increase depression
compared with satisfactory re-employment, whereas values for
the unemployed fall between. Increased depression scores among
unemployed men in the Social Change and Economic Life
Initiative were not reduced by re-employment in an insecure
job,27 and a longitudinal population study of young women
and men found psychological disorder to be higher among
dissatisfied workers than in the unemployed.28
Qualitative studies of unemployment have provided evidence
that different personal positions can lead to contrasting attitudes
to being unemployed. Studies, such as those by Little29 and
Fineman,30 conclude that, in a sizeable minority, unemployment
gives rise to positive feelings. Of the 100 middle-class un-
employed in the Fineman study, one-third saw their unemploy-
ment as an opportunity to escape from boring or stressful jobs
and find employment which could meet long-frustrated needs.
Those who obtained such re-employment talked of the liberating
experience and the renewed energy they had for their new job.
However, those who did not were left feeling inadequate and
threatened in ways they had not experienced before.30
Taken together such findings has led a number of researchers
to conclude that `no job' may be better than `any job' and
that cumulative labour market disadvantage may have more
relevance for psychological well-being than unemployment
alone.13,27,31
