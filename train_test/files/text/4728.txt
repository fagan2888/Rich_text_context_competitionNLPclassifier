Abstract
This study examines the news selection practices followed by news organizations
through investigating the news posted on social networking sites and, in particular, the
Facebook pages of four foreign Arabic language TV stations: The Iranian Al-Alam TV,
Russia Today, Deutsche Welle, and BBC. A total of 15,589 news stories are analyzed in
order to examine the prominence of references to countries and political actors. The
study reveals that social significance and proximity as well as the news organizations'
ideological agenda are the most important elements that dictate the news selection
process.

Introduction
This study deals with the news dissemination practice on social networking sites (SNSs),
which is a largely under-researched topic despite its importance and relevance in today's
world.Another important aspect of the study is that it empirically tests the news selection
process in relation to references to countries and political actors linked to newsworthi-
ness like the relevance of ideology, social significance, and proximity. In this regard, the
criteria followed in news selection are all part of the news values theory, as will be
explained below. References to countries and political actors provide an indication of the

general tendencies of ideologically diverse news organizations toward political cover-
age. Furthermore, the study provides a cross-national comparative perspective through
the investigation of the news articles posted by the IranianAl-Alam TV, the Russia Today
(RT), the German Deutsche Welle (DW), and the BBC.
All the above channels are very different in nature, yet they have one thing in com-
mon which is the use of Arabic language. Since the 9/11 events, there has been a
growing interest by many foreign governments to disseminate media messages to the
Arab masses, especially with the use of national cultural industries like television
(Straubhaar, 1991). Snow and Taylor (2006) assert that the `war on terror is essen-
tially a global struggle for hearts and minds, and the media are the principal channels
for winning the argument' (p. 400). As a result, many satellite TV channels emerged
to target the Arab world with long hours of Arabic language programs (Lahlali, 2011).
It is estimated that over 1billion dollars were spent up to mid-2013 on running a sin-
gle Arabic language channel, Al-Hurra TV, which is owned by the US government
(Seib, 2013: 11). It seems that the majority of these channels gained popularity
because they offer news insights into events taking place around the world and some-
times cover important issues and topics in the Arab region in an attempt to compete
with other Pan-Arab channels like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya (El-Nawawy, 2006).
Also, most of these channels provide platforms for Arab audiences to participate and
debate issues such as the case of BBC Arabic (Hill and Alshaer, 2010), and many of
them have gained credibility due to the timely and professional manner by which
news is produced (Al-Jaber and Gunter, 2013; Elareshi and Gunter, 2012). Indeed,
these channels are used as tools for public diplomacy by serving the various eco-
nomic, cultural, and political interests as well as the foreign policies of the non-Arab
governments that run them `as part of the ongoing political rivalry in the region' (Hill
and Alshaer, 2010; Mellor et al., 2011: 96).
Facebook that has been chosen for this news investigation, for this online platform,
has become a very important SNS tool for reading and commenting on news. Online
users consume more news on Facebook-recommended pages than on Twitter, especially
after introducing the Facebook Social Reader (Mitchell and Rosenstiel, 2012). Although
the survey deals with the US audience, it is important to mention the results of a Pew
study here because it can provide general insight into audiences' media habits in other
regions. According to this study, about 30percent of Facebook users get their news on
this platform which is higher than any other SNSs such as YouTube (10%) and Twitter
(8%) (Pew Research ­ Journalism Project, 2013). When SNS users like a Facebook page
of a news organization, they begin receiving its news feeds, which is a new form of news
subscription (Ju et al., 2013: 4).
In the following literature review, a discussion of the theoretical concept of news
values and ideologies as well as news organizations' SNS use is presented because they
are directly linked to the focus of this study. First, the literature on news values provides
the main theoretical background in which this study is situated as it deals with the news
selection process of several news organizations. The other area covered in the literature
review is ambient journalism or news organizations' SNS use. In particular, this study
investigates the news selection process on SNSs which is another under-researched area
in journalism and media studies. By examining the literature on news values, we find that
Al-Rawi 873
the majority of previous studies focus on traditional media outlets rather than their social
media platforms; hence, exploring this can help in further understanding the news selec-
tion agendas of these news organizations.
Literature review
Since this study deals with the concept of news values, it is important to begin the
discussion with one of the first studies in this field. This research relies on the pioneer-
ing study of Galtung and Ruge's (1965) taxonomy of news as well as on Harcup and
O'Neill's (2001) follow-up study which proposes a number of news values criteria,
including the power elite, celebrity, entertainment, surprise, bad news, good news,
magnitude, relevance, follow up, and newspaper agenda (see also Brighton and Foy,
2007). Here, the political and cultural dimensions are linked to the ideology that is
relevant to this study.
In their hierarchical model of news values, Shoemaker and Reese (1996) explain that
news is influenced by several factors including routine newsroom practices and ideologi-
cal values adhered by journalists and their news organization. In their more developed
theory of news values, Shoemaker and Cohen (2006) focus on the elements of deviance
intensity and social significance to explain newsworthiness. The former is classified into
three main types: statistical, social change, and normative, while the latter is defined as
`relevance for the social system' in relation to four dimensions: political, economic, cul-
tural, and public (pp. 7, 15, and 49). In the two models above, there is a clear focus on
the impact of the relevant context and ideological values on newsworthiness as they
apparently encompass political and religious attitudes and stances that can explain the
newsworthiness measures followed by some news organizations.
Furthermore, Adams (1986) examines how proximity in the news can be an important
indicator of newsworthiness especially in terms of economic, political, and cultural ties
which connect nations together. This seems to be related to people's beliefs and general
interests. Cohen et al. (1990) refer to a similar concept which is called psychological
proximity in the sense that people have `zones of relevance' which they use to determine
the relevance or importance of news to their lives. This, of course, applies to journalists'
decisions in the news selection process as these zones of relevance can be of various
kinds, like sharing certain political, religious, or cultural beliefs and values. In other
words, some counties or nations tend to be newsworthy for those with which their audi-
ences share similar ideologies and cultural values.
Indeed, news organizations must be influenced by certain ideologies. In this regard,
Thompson (1990) emphasizes that ideology is a `meaning in the service of power' (p. 7)
which can explain how news organizations can sometimes become tools used by their
owners to convey certain messages. This is in line with Herman and Chomsky's (2008)
propaganda model in which one of the main news filters is media ownership. On the
other hand, journalists themselves must be influenced by their own ideology even if they
have not noticed it. Stuart Hall (1985) affirms that journalists are `inscribed by an ideol-
ogy to which they do not consciously commit themselves, and which, instead, "writes
them"' (p. 101). What is evident here is that the influence of the ideological background
cannot be overlooked in understanding the news selection process.

News organizations and use of SNSs
Before the introduction of SNSs, news organizations realized the need to change their
traditional one-way communication strategy by giving viewers the freedom to comment
on news and sometimes allowing them to customize the online platforms into their own
preferences (Chung, 2008; Chung and Yoo, 2008); some news organizations also pub-
lished readers' comments in the print version (McElroy, 2013). This was one of the first
steps taken by media outlets to broaden their readership. Later, several news organiza-
tions created multimedia platforms in which the news experience is characterized by
three main features: portable, personalized, and participatory (Project for Excellence in
Journalism, 2010). Some of the interactive features provided by news organizations
included creating discussion groups, blogs, and forums (Boczkowski, 1999; Schultz,
2000), which is called a `demassified forms of feedback' (Lievrouw, 2001: 21). All the
above interactive tools enable journalists to interact with their readers, on one hand, and
readers can exchange their opinions among themselves, on the other hand (Constantinescu
and Tedesco, 2007: 449). Also, many newspapers and TV stations provide hyperlinks to
other topics and stories by which journalists are able to change the news frame that
`emphasizes broader social and political themes' since the `[e]xpanded framing may
prove central to re-engaging an increasingly distrusting and alienated citizenry in a 21st
Century democracy' (Pavlik, 2001: 320). This new phenonmenon can be called news
organizations 2.0.
There are several studies that examine the comments sections of news sites by, for
example, content analysis (Abdul-Mageed, 2008; McCluskey and Hmielowski, 2012),
but there are only a few empirical studies that investigated the content of news stories
posted on news organizations' SNS channels. Having realized the growing significance
of social media, news organizations are involved more than ever in them, viewing ser-
vices like Facebook and Twitter `as opportunities to market and distribute content'
(Hermida et al., 2012; see also Arceneaux and Weiss, 2010). Messner et al. (2011) found
in their study that 81percent of the US TV stations had Facebook pages in 2009 which
changed into 100percent in 2010 (pp. 14­15). What is important here is that news is read
and shared much more than before as it has become a social experience (Redden and
Witschge, 2010: 181). Hermida (2010) calls this phenomenon `ambient journalism'
which refers to social information networks that provide an `asynchronous, lightweight
and always-on communication system ... enabling citizens to maintain a mental model
of news and events around them' (p. 301). Goode (2009) stresses that news stories are
being `amplified, sustained and potentially morphed as they are re-circulated, reworked,
and reframed by online networks' (p. 1293).
In fact, many news organizations implemented social media guidelines for their
employees and hired social media specialists due to their importance in maintaining the
image and identity as well as enhancing the public relations efforts of these news organ-
izations (Ju et al., 2013: 1; Morton, 2010; Muralidharan et al., 2011: 228; Steyn et al.,
2010). Among the first TV stations that used Facebook to enhance its news dissemina-
tion was ABC News which officially partnered in 2007 with Facebook to allow its users
to `electronically follow ABC reporters, view reports and video and participate in polls
and debates, all within a new "U.S. Politics" category' (Stelter, 2007). Also, CNN, for
Al-Rawi 875
example, employed around 150 employees to tweet the news by the fall of 2008
(Garrison-Sprenger, 2008), and it created the `Facebook Connect' service to increase
online audiences and make them more connected (Emmett, 2009). Most commonly,
news organizations would share hyperlinks to stories posted online in order to direct
traffic from SNSs to their own websites wherein users can also comment using their
Facebook and Google+ accounts (Goodman, 2013: 48; Ju et al., 2013: 1). In this way,
the news contents can be disseminated `virally' (Stelter, 2007, para. 11). Furthermore,
SNSs have offered solutions to news organizations that are less problematic and costly
than the comments section which usually contains a great deal of incivility (Howell,
2007). Braun and Gillespie (2011) call SNSs `digital intermediaries' because of their
practical functions.
Finally, it is important to note that SNS newsreaders are not always engaged or inter-
ested in everything posted by the news organization despite the fact that they follow its
Twitter or Facebook pages. For example, when NPR posted a controversial story on its
Facebook page during April Fools' Day, many online readers commented on it by read-
ing the headline only rather than reading the full story which was merely a prank
(Dickson, 2014; NPR, 2014). This example sheds light on the kind of weak involvement
some online readers have with news mostly due to time constraints. Yet, this phenome-
non is not confined to news stories posted on SNS outlets as previous studies have shown
similar tendencies when it comes to print and online media (Garcia et al., 1991; Holmqvist
et al., 2003).
In order to cover some of the overlooked aspects of news values decisions followed
by news organizations, this research study attempts to answer the following research
questions:
RQ1. In relation to the news selection process, what is the dominance of news stories
in relation to references to countries posted on the Facebook pages of the four TV
channels?
RQ2. In relation to the news selection process, what is the dominance of news stories
in relation to references to political actors posted on the Facebook pages of the four
TV channels?
Method
For the purpose of the study, a webometric tool called NVivo 10 ­ NCapture was used to
mine the Facebook posts of the following Arabic language TV channels: Al-Alam TV
(Iranian), RT (Russian), DW (German), and BBC (British) in late February 2014. These
channels have been chosen because they represent a broad spectrum of foreign channels
broadcasting to the Arab world in Arabic language, so it is highly important to compare
them, especially that the journalists working at these stations presumably have diverse
ideological backgrounds due to the different political and media systems they live in. For
example, Al-Alam TV channel is run by a government that is characterized by its totali-
tarian rule which has a tight control over the media (Semati, 2007: 144); hence, Al-Alam
channel is used as a state instrument to influence the opinions of Arab masses. Similarly,
876 Journalism 18(7)
RT is regarded as a propaganda tool in the hands of Putin's government to serve foreign
policy interests (Ioffe, 2010). On the other hand, the BBC and DW, which are both
regarded as public broadcasting services, are more independent from their respective
governments and both originate from well-established Western democracies.
In order to have a better understanding of the news selection practices followed by
these four TV channels, it is important to provide some background information on each
of these media outlets. First, Al-Alam (The World) TV is a 24-hour Arabic channel that
is financed and run by the Republic of Iran Broadcasting. The channel airs 36 extended
and brief newscasts that are compiled by 50 correspondents stationed in 40 countries. It
has four main bureaus in Tehran, Baghdad, Beirut, and Damascus, and the channel
started broadcasting in February 2003 with the onset of the US-led invasion of Iraq
(Al-Alam, 2012). The timing of this launch seems to denote Iran's need to influence the
public opinion in the Arab world and to communicate the Iranian official outlook toward
the events happening in the region. Al-Alam's website is in two languages: Persian and
Arabic, and it allows readers to post comments on the website. The channel admits that
it gives special attention to some important issues in the Islamic world especially Iraq,
Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, and African states (Al-Alam, 2012). According to the goals,
which are published on its website, the channel aims at airing `fast, credible, and precise'
news, and it further claims to address `solutions to the problems that the Islamic andArab
world is suffering from after investigating their deep roots' (Al-Alam, 2012). From the
beginning, Iranian authorities installed TV transmitters near the Iraqi border to guarantee
that Al-Alam's airwaves reach a large segment of the Iraqi public (Usher, 2006). During
the US-led invasion of Iraq, the channel played an important role in emphasizing the
number of Iraqi civilian causalities as it called the conflict a `"war of domination" and
routinely referred to coalition forces as "occupiers"' (BBC Monitoring, 2003). Finally,
Al-Alam's Facebook page has over 673k likes and 354k people talking about it (face-
book.com/alalamarabic) as of 27 March 2014.
Second, BBC Arabic television started broadcasting in March 2008, though there was
an earlier broadcasting in cooperation with Orbit Network in 1994 which lasted about
2years. BBC Arabic TV is part of the BBC public broadcaster organization in the United
Kingdom, but it is not as old as the BBC Arabic radio service which began transmission
in 1938. On the website of BBC Arabic (bbcarabic.com), online readers cannot post any
comments on news reports; instead, there is only the option of `share your opinion' in a
special section on the website. Hence, the news organization seems to freely allow online
readers to post their views on Facebook because it apparently takes no time and efforts
from the staff to moderate the comments on this platform, as will be explained below.
According to the BBC Arabic website, the news organization is regarded as the `most
credible and objective outlets in the Arab world' (BBC Arabic, 2014). Also, over 21mil-
lion people visit its website including about 1.5 unique visitors.As for its Facebook page,
it has over 2.3million likes and 107k people talking about it (facebook.com/bbcarabic).
Third, RT Arabic (arabic.rt.com/) or Rusiya Al-Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May
2007. The name of the channel has officially changed into RT, and it is run by TV-Novosti
which is affiliated with the Russian government. On its website, the channel claims to be
`non-commercial and independent', and about 350million people can view the channel
in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe (RTArabic, 2014). Unlike BBC Arabic, RT
Al-Rawi 877
Arabic allows online readers to post comments on its website. Its Facebook page has
over 2.5million likes and 242k people talking about it (facebook.com/rtarabic.ru).
Finally, DW Arabic (dw.de//s-9106) is part of Germany's public interna-
tional broadcaster. DW Arabic was established in 2002 and aired programs for 2hours
only which were later extended to 6hours in 2011 (DW, 2011). The TV channel is not as
old as its Arabic radio station that began transmission in 1959. Comments posted on DW
Arabic are moderated and controlled. For example, online readers have to fill in and
submit a special form in order to be able to make a comment. After 2011, airtime hours
were extended. Currently, DW Arabic airs 10
hours of Arabic programs followed by
14hours in English that reach viewers in the Middle East and North Africa. According to
the DW website, two programs are very popular in the Arab world, Shabab talk (Youth
talk) and The New Arab Debates because they involve young Arabs debating politics and
social issues (DW, 2014). Its Facebook page has over 601k likes and 31k people talking
about it as of 27 March 2014 (facebook.com/dw.arabic).
In most cases, the Facebook page administrator posts the news headline, a hyperlink
that leads to the online article that is available on the news organization's website, and
a lead containing a brief description of the whole article. In some cases, a video link or
photo accompanies the news article. Based on a cross-examination of a random sample
of over 160 news stories posted on the four Facebook pages, it appears that all the head-
lines and leads are typical to what is found in the websites themselves since the Facebook
page administrators copy and paste the same original materials without altering them. If
any online reader feels interested in a news report, (s)he can click the hyperlink leading
to the complete version posted on the website. For the purpose of this study, all the news
articles posted on Facebook from mid-December 2013 until mid-February 2014 were
investigated in this study in order to examine the news posted in the same time frame.
The news stories that are studied include 822 by DW, 1040 by BBC, 5741 by RT, and
7986 by Al-Alam, and the total number of news stories investigated in this study is
15,589 stories which are all in Arabic. Al-Hurra TV was initially chosen, but its
Facebook page contained mostly questions for its online audience, so it was excluded
from the study.
The collected posts were analyzed using QDA Miner 4 ­ Wordstat program. This
study content analyzes the text corpus by identifying the most recurrent words used in
the posts (Al-Rawi, 2014, 2015). Stephen (2000) studies concept analysis by `identifying
key concepts and clusters of concepts'in which he examines `the analysis of the distribu-
tion and interconnection of pivotal ideas appearing in a textual database' (p. 197). In
some of his framing studies, Entman (2010) uses QDA Miner and mentions that it was
useful due to its `improved efficiency in carrying our more complex content analyses'(p.
334). This quantitative method is useful to identify the most dominant words used by
posters which `minimizes problems of research judgment' (Miller, 1997: 376).
In this study, two main news selections are made. First, the most recurrent words
based on the repetition of three times and above are examined, so all references to coun-
tries, their capitals, and any derivation of the countries' name like their different adjec-
tives are counted. This is part of the news values study in order to investigate which
countries are more prominent in the news reports in the sense that they are repeatedly
mentioned. The names of countries' capitals are incorporated because in some cases the
878 Journalism 18(7)
reference to the country's capital is used as a metonym, standing for the government or
state as a whole. In the end, the top 10 most referenced countries are identified as can be
seen in Table 1. Second, the number of references to politicians or political actors is
examined. As there are far too many politicians mentioned, the selection is limited to
those who have a total of over a 100 references (see Table 2 and Figure 2). All preposi-
tions and articles are also removed in order to focus on proper nouns.
Results and discussion
As indicated above, this study examines the Arabic language Facebook posts of four TV
channels. The results of the study show that there are stark variations in the kind of atten-
tion and emphasis given to countries and political actors, but it is important to note here
that some of these differences are due to the vast variations in the news volume or num-
ber of news reports posted on Facebook, as indicated above. For example, in the time
frame investigated in this study, Al-Alam posted 7986 stories, whereas DW Arabic had
only 822. Hence, there was a need to examine the percentage of coverage in relation to
countries and political actors. The figures cited in the two tables are taken from raw data,
while the percentages are calculated based on the total number of references to countries
and political figures made by each news organization.
In relation to the countries cited in the headlines and leads, Table 1 shows the fre-
quency of attention and average percentage by the four channels.
By examining the raw data of all the TV channels, we find that the top five countries
cited are (1) Syria (n=3608), (2) Iran (n=1772), (3) Iraq (n=1470), (4) Egypt (n=1359),
and (5) Russia (n=1143). Due to the disparity in the number of news stories posted on the
four Facebook pages, it is also important to examine the average percentage of each coun-
try mentioned along the four Facebook pages which are as follows: (1) Syria 19.1percent,
(2) Egypt 12.3percent, (3) Iraq 8.6percent, (4) Russia 6.2percent, and (5) Iran 5.9percent
(for a more complete overview of the countries frequencies, see Figure 1).
As for the references and average percentage of political actors by the four channels,
Table 2 illustrates the results.
The raw data taken from all four TV channels in relation to references to political
figures reveal that the top five actors are (1) Sergey Lavrov (n
=
288), (2) John Kerry
(n=244), (3) Bashar Assad (n=194), (4) Vladimir Putin (n=184), and (5) Abdel Fattah
el-Sisi (n=164) (see Figure 2 for another overview of the political actors highlighted by
the four channels). Using the same procedure followed above with references to coun-
tries, we find that the average percentages of each political actor mentioned along the
four Facebook pages are as follows: (1)Abdel Fattah el-Sisi 19.7percent, (2) Mohammed
Morsi 18.4
percent, (3) John Kerry 16.6
percent, (4) Bashar Assad 9.7
percent, and (5)
Nouri Maliki 8percent.
As explained above, news production is affected by different factors such as the ideo-
logical values of the journalists and their news organizations as well as media ownership.
Shoemaker and Cohen (2006) refer to social significance as one of the important elements
of newsworthiness which is related to the news `relevance for the social system' along
four dimensions: political, economic, cultural, and public (pp. 7, 15). Furthermore,Adams
(1986) and Cohen et al. (1990) emphasize the importance of psychological proximity in

the news as another indicator of newsworthiness. In general, a news organization gives
more prominence to an issue if more coverage is devoted to it (Hofstetter, 1976; Siune
et al., 1984) which is evident either by the volume of coverage or by the ongoing report
on the issue.
To answer the first research question on the dominance of news stories in relation to
references to countries, there seems to be great variations in the number of news stories
and their focus among the four channels, but it is important to note first that most of the
TV channels have special sections for language teaching (Farsi, German, Russian, and
English) and general information about the countries that run or host the news organiza-
tion. This clearly indicates that the news organizations such as RT Arabic and Al-Alam,
which are managed by their respective governments, can function as public diplomacy
tools, though other purposes might be involved like promoting tourism. For RT Arabic,
Syria is the country that attracted most of the attention 25.2
percent (n=1106) which is
clearly due to the ongoing conflict there. References to Russia came second 22.3percent
(n=980) which is also understandable because of the need to add relevance and proximity

to the news. Switzerland came third 7.7
percent (n
=
340) mostly in relation to the
UN-organized Geneva meeting in which officials from the Syrian government met with
opposition groups and parties. The United States came fourth 7.5
percent (n=333) fol-
lowed by Egypt 7percent (n=311).
In relation to Al-Alam TV, we find the same editorial tendency followed by RTArabic
since there is a clear emphasis on highlighting Iran and its role in the region. There is also
the sectarian proximity or social significance ­ cultural relevance that plays a role here;
for example, Al-Alam made 50 references to the Houthis, the Shiite opposition group in
Yemen though no other channel referred to them. Syria comes first again because of the
conflict with 2231 references (23.9%) followed by Iran 16.3
percent (n=1528), Iraq
11.7percent (n
=
1098), and Bahrain 9.1
percent (n=854). Again, religious proximity
seems to play a role here as Bahrain is not regarded as a newsworthy topic by the other
news organizations, but Al-Alam emphasizes the Shiite protests against the Sunni mon-
archy in its news reports. In fact, the channel devotes a special section for Bahraini news
in order to thoroughly cover the events taking place there. Also noteworthy is the fact
Figure 2. Frequency of references to political actors by the four channels on their Facebook
pages.
The numbers above the columns represent the unique political figures' numbers on the right side of this
figure.
Al-Rawi 883
thatAl-Alam showed a great deal of emphasis in airing the Shiite protests in SaudiArabia
as well as the fighting between the Shiite Hawthis and government troops in Yemen. At
the same time, the channel downplayed the events taking place in Syria and Iraq between
Sunni rebels and Shiite government forces. As Sebastian Usher (2006) claims, Iran uses
Al-Alam channel in order to `influence and stir up opinion in the Arab world and beyond
­ just as it tries to control the information available to its own people within the country'.
As a result, Al-Alam news coverage created anger and distrust among policy makers in
the Arab world which led to jamming its signals (Press TV, 2011) and to the decision to
stop its transmission on Nilesat and Arabsat on 3 November 2010. Arabsat did allow the
channel to resume broadcasting, yet it stopped its transmission another time within a
period of 2months (Al-Alam, 2010). It is assumed that due to the difficulty of watching
the channel in the Arab world via the two popular Arab satellites, Al-Alam enhanced its
social media activity especially on Facebook to maintain and possibly increase its audi-
ence engagements. This partly explains the high number of stories posted on its Facebook
page in comparison with the other channels examined in this study. According to
Socialbakers (2014), Al-Alam's Facebook page fan distribution is as follows: 21.6per-
cent Iraq, 17.5
percent Syria, 9.5
percent Egypt, 4.8
percent Yemen, 4.7
percent Russia,
4.7percent Saudi Arabia, 3.3percent Lebanon, and 2.7percent Bahrain. There seems to
be some level of correlation between Al-Alam's Facebook fans and the demographic
specificities of some of the above countries.
As for BBC Arabic, the United Kingdom is mentioned more than the other countries
23.8percent (n
=
242), followed by Egypt 18.3
percent (n=186), Syria 13.9percent
(n=142), and Iraq 5.9percent (n=60). Again, there is emphasis on the country of origin
which runs or sponsors the news organization. Finally and as expected, DW highlighted
Germany more than other countries with 285 references (29.6%) followed by Egypt
(n=159), Syria (n=129), and Iraq (n=121). The above results show that the BBC and
DW are the only channels that highlighted the events and political changes in Egypt
more than the conflict in Syria. This can be explained based on the political dimension
of social significance as well as the social change deviance in news values that focuses
on `threats to the status quo' in connection to covering `civil demonstrations that bring
about a new presidential election' (Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006: 49).
Yet by examining all the four TV channels' average percentages, we find that Syria
comes first with 19.1percent followed by Egypt 12.3percent, Iraq 8.6percent, Russia
6.2
percent, and Iran 5.9
percent. The magnitude of events taking place in Syria, the
follow-up factor, and the fact that it deals with bad news all explain why this country
ranks first as these are all basic elements of news values (Harcup and O'Neill, 2001).
Based on the number of references to countries, it becomes clear that Al-Alam TV pays
great attention to Bahrain and the Shiite protests in the Gulf region though the news
significance cannot be compared to other important events taking place in the Arab
region. Aside from the ideological influence stated above, other elements like social
significance and proximity are involved in explaining the prominence given to certain
countries like Russia on RT Arabic, Germany on DW Arabic, and the United Kingdom
on BBC Arabic.
To answer the second research question on the dominance of news stories in relation
to references to political actors, we find that RT Arabic focused on Russian politicians
884 Journalism 18(7)
much more than other actors; in this regard, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov,
came first with 150 references (21.9%) followed by the Russian President, Vladimir
Putin 21.9percent (n=150), John Kerry 14.9percent (n=102), and Ban Ki-moon 8.6per-
cent (n=59). The latter was mostly mentioned in connection to the Geneva meeting cited
above. As for the attention given to political actors by Al-Alam TV, the Iranian President,
Hassan Rouhani, was the most referenced 14.7
percent (n
=
139), followed by Bashar
Assad 14.4percent (n=136), John Kerry 12.2percent (n=115), and Nouri Maliki 12per-
cent (n=113). Ideological affinity and psychological proximity seem to play a role here
as Assad, an Alawite whose government is closely backed by the Iranian regime, is high-
lighted in Al-Alam's TV news reports far more than the other channels. Also, Al-Alam
and RTArabic are the only two channels that highlighted the activities of Walid Muallem
Al-Mu'lam, the Syrian Foreign Minister. Similar to Iran, Russia is a staunch ally of
Assad's regime for various reasons including some shared interests as well as Putin's
alleged fear that the popular sentiments of overthrowing totalitarian regimes in the
Middle East might spread to Russia (Allison, 2013: 815­818). According to a qualitative
study examining the Russian media coverage of the Syrian conflict, more blame for the
prevailing violence is directed at Islamist radicals rather than Assad's regime which
includes accusing the Syrian opposition to be behind the chemical attack in the outskirts
of Damascus (Brown, 2014: 57). This kind of coverage is understandable if we take into
account that the media in Russia is largely polarized especially in relation to `nationally
distributed TV channels', and RT is certainly included because it is state-funded; these
channels are `increasingly used by the state as tools to support the vertical power system
...' (Vartanova, 2012: 134).
As for the main political actors mentioned by BBC Arabic, we only find Mohammed
Morsi 43.1
percent (n
=
25), the former Egyptian president, coming first followed by
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi 34.4
percent (n
=
20) and John Kerry 22.4
percent (n=13). As for
references to political actors by DW, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi 29.6percent (n=24) is the most
cited actor followed by Mohammed Morsi 18.5percent (n=15), Bashar Assad 18.5per-
cent (n=15), and John Kerry 17.2percent (n=14) (see Table 2 and Figure 2). As men-
tioned above, the more attention given to a country or political actor, the more importance
is shown. In other words, each news organization paid special emphasis to their respec-
tive countries and national politicians except for the BBC and DW, though the latter
made 21 references to Angela Merkel. One of the main possible reasons for such a dif-
ference in coverage is that the Iranian and Russian channels are directly supported and
influenced by their respective governments as stated above which ultimately affect the
news values' choices. On the other hand, the BBC and DW showed different emphases
because they are more independent from their governments, especially in terms of fund-
ing due to their mandate as public broadcasting services.
Conclusion
Since SNS use has become an integral part of the news consumption experience in
today's world, it has become important to thoroughly study news organizations' social
media use. Indeed, SNSs offer new opportunities for news organizations to reach more
audiences in what Hermida (2010) called `ambient journalism' or a non-moderated
Al-Rawi 885
platform for online readers. These platforms have become magnets for interested readers
to consume, share, like, and disseminate news as well as interact with others on a variety
of issues and in a very timely, thorough, and engaging manner.
This study examined the news posted on the Facebook pages of four Arabic language
TV stations: The Iranian Al-Alam TV, the RT, the German DW, and the BBC. From the
total 15,589 news stories analyzed, the study finds that social significance and proximity
as well as the news organizations' ideological agenda are among the principal elements
that explain the news selection process. The results of this study correspond with Galtung
and Ruge (1965) and Harcup and O'Neill's (2001) theories on the taxonomy of news
particularly in relation to social significance and proximity as well as the news organiza-
tions' ideological agenda (Thompson, 1990).
For future research, other news organizations can be selected in order to find differ-
ences and similarities in the news stories posted on SNSs. Also, other social media plat-
forms can be chosen like Twitter, Google+, and YouTube to find whether differences
exist in the quantity and type of news stories posted by news organizations. Finally,
semi-structured interviews with journalists and news organizations staff responsible for
managing the various SNS platforms of news organizations can shed light into important
aspects that have not been covered in this study.
