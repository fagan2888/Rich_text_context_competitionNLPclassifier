Index (ONQI)1­4
David L Katz, Valentine Y Njike, Lauren Q Rhee, Arthur Reingold, and Keith T Ayoob
ABSTRACT
Background: Improving diets has considerable potential to im-
prove health, but progress in this area has been limited, and advice
to increase fruit and vegetable intake has largely gone unheeded.
Objectives: Our objective was to test the performance character-
istics of the Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI), a tool de-
signed to help improve dietary patterns one well-informed choice at
a time.
Design: The ONQI was developed by a multidisciplinary group of
nutrition and public health scientists independent of food industry
interests and is the basis for the NuVal Nutritional Guidance Sys-
tem. Dietary guidelines, existing nutritional scoring systems, and
other pertinent scientific literature were reviewed. An algorithm
incorporating .30 entries that represent both micro- and macronu-
trient properties of foods, as well as weighting coefficients repre-
senting epidemiologic associations between nutrients and health
outcomes, was developed and subjected to consumer research and
testing of performance characteristics.
Results: ONQI and expert panel rankings correlated highly (R =
0.92, P , 0.001). In consumer testing, '80% of .800 study par-
ticipants indicated that the ONQI would influence their purchase
intent. ONQI scoring distinguished the more-healthful DASH (Di-
etary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (mean score: 46) from
the typical American diet according to the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003­2006 (mean score:
26.5; P , 0.01). In linear regression analysis of the NHANES
2003­2006 populations (n = 15,900), the NuVal system was signif-
icantly associated with the Healthy Eating Index 2005 (P ,
0.0001). Recently generated data from ongoing studies indicate
favorable effects on purchase patterns and significant correlation
with health outcomes in large cohorts of men and women followed
for decades.
Conclusion: NuVal offers universally applicable nutrition guidance
that is independent of food industry interests and is supported
by consumer research and scientific evaluation of its performance
characteristics. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;91(suppl):1102S­8S.
INTRODUCTION
Dietary patterns at odds with health are a major contributor to
chronic disease and premature death (1). Improvements in the
prevailing diet in the United States are among the leading health
objectives for the nation (2). The provision of nutrition in-
formation to inform food choice as a means to improving diet and
health is a well-established principle of public health and food
commerce (3). The modern era of product-specific nutrition
guidance in the United States was ushered in with the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act, which was passed in 1990 (4).
Although appropriate, advice to the public to change their diets
across-the-board, such as to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern
(5­7) and/or to a more plant-based dietary pattern (8, 9), have had
little effect on prevailing norms (10­12).
In response to growing concerns about diet-related health
problems, diverse systems and logos have been developed by
manufacturers and organizations to highlight the nutritional
benefits of select products. Reliable food-level guidance appli-
cable to all foods and eating occasions would provide consumers
the opportunity to improve their diets, and potentially their
health, one food choice at a time, in any food category. The
Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI) was developed by
nutrition and public health scientists independently of food in-
dustry interests to provide expert yet simple guidance to con-
sumers, beginning on the supermarket shelf. The ONQI
development and applications have been previously described
(13). This article describes the scientific assessment of key
performance characteristics of the ONQI algorithm, which
operates in the marketplace under the name NuVal.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The development of the ONQI algorithm (see Table 1) by
a multidisciplinary group of nutrition and public health experts
(see Table 2) has been previously described (13). In brief, the
group convened voluntarily to undertake the challenge of de-
veloping a nutrition guidance system based on the overall nu-
tritional quality of foods. Funding for the effort was provided
entirely by Griffin Hospital (14), a not-for-profit, Yale University­
1 From the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, Derby, CT (DLK,
VYN, and LQR); Topco Associates, Skokie, IL (AR); and the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY (KTA).

affiliated community hospital in Derby, CT; no food industry
elements were involved in the project. Griffin Hospital is home
to the Yale School of Medicine's Prevention Research Center
(15) where the project was coordinated. The scientific expert
panel members were compensated by Griffin Hospital for their
time and effort. This group was responsible for all content de-
cisions regarding the algorithm.
The scientific assessment of the ONQI to date encompasses
elements of content validity, construct validity, criterion validity,
and consumer (face validity) testing. Content validity assessment
was based on the development panel reaching a consensus that the
algorithm was reasonable and appropriate in basic content. This
judgment was predicated on the collective experience and knowl-
edge of the panel, as well as on the extensive review of pertinent
literature (see http://www.nuval.com for a relevant bibliography).
The first step in construct validity testing was an assessment of
the correlation between ONQI scores and rankings with the
pooled, mean rankings of foods by the members of the expert
panel. Testing was conducted on a diverse group of foods and on
foods within categories. Correlational analysis of this sort was
limited to a total pool of '120 foods due to the labor in-
tensiveness of manually ranking foods on overall nutritional
quality. A much larger test set of diverse foods was then scored by
the ONQI and reviewed for anomalies by the expert panel. This
process continued with a total set of '1000 foods until no scoring
anomalies were perceived or until all such apparent anomalies
were fully explained in a detailed review of nutrient composition.
Consumer testing to establish face validity was concurrent with
construct validity testing and involved both qualitative and
quantitative components; this research was overseen by an in-
house marketing consultant (A Reingold) and the marketing re-
search and technology firm, Affinnova (16). Consumer testing was
directed toward 2 primary objectives: 1) understanding consumer
response to the concept and 2) determining how best to com-
municate the concept. Three focus groups were held in October
2007 at a marketing research facility in suburban Chicago and
conducted by a marketing firm that specializes in focus group
research; each group was led by a professional moderator. Each
group convened for '2 h and included 8­10 participants/group.
The subjects were female head of households who were in-
terested in making improved food choices; one group included
women aged 60­69 y with no children at home, although 2
groups included women aged 35­55 y with and without children

1 Micronutrient factors are summed in the numerator and denominator,
respectively. Macronutrient factors enter the algorithm as multipliers. All
nutrient entries are weighted on the basis of their health effects for the
prevalence of relevant conditions, the severity of the relevant conditions,
and the strength of association between the nutrient and relevant conditions.
Ordinal scales are used for each weighting coefficient.
2 Applied to the numerator; protein quality is measured as the essential
amino acid among 9 present in the lowest concentration relative to its con-
centration in egg albumin; fat quality is measured as the proportion of total
fat that is poly- or monounsaturated.
3 The intrinsic sodium of natural plant foods (eg, vegetables, fruit,
beans, nuts, etc) was not counted.
4 Applied to the denominator.
5 Discounted for pure cooking oils.
6 The intrinsic sugar of natural plant foods (eg, fruit) was not counted.
7 Applied selectively to grain and grain-containing products to help
differentiate the scores of whole-grain from refined-grain products and prod-
ucts with added sugars.

at home. The focus groups followed typical qualitative marketing
research protocols by starting with very broad food and shopping
behaviors and then narrowed down to specific concepts directly
related to nutritional profiling and the ONQI.
Semiquantitative consumer studies were conducted in No-
vember 2007 and March 2008 by Affinnova (16). These were
Internet-based studies, accessed via a secure website by enrollees.
The November 2007 survey included 7 screener questions and 17
concept questions with the following eligibility criteria: women
aged 35­64 y, with children, who were the primary grocery
shopper and who had an interest in a healthy lifestyle, including
good nutrition. The March 2008 survey included 7 screener
questions and 18 concept questions with the following eligibility
criteria: men and women, aged 18­64 y, who were the primary
grocery shoppers for their households.
The next phase of construct validity testing was an assessment
of the degree to which aggregated ONQI scores for total diet
differentiated a health-promoting dietary pattern (ie, generated
a higher score) from a typical American diet (which generated
a lower score). For this comparison, a 7-d meal plan from the
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet at the
2300-mg sodium level (17) was used as the health-promoting
diet, and mean dietary intake data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003­2006 cohort
(18) were used to represent the typical American diet.
Next, dietary intake data from the NHANES 2003­2006 co-
hort were used to assess the association between ONQI scores
and both the numerical scores and the quartiles of the Healthy
Eating Index 2005 (19). Analytic methods included chi-square,
linear trend testing, and linear regression.
Nutritional analyses for both the DASH meal plan and the
NHANES data were performed by using a "composite recipe"
approach. This entails creating a summary measure of nutrient
density (nutrients/kcal) for all of the ONQI nutrients by using all
of the consumed foods. This method is a less labor-intensive
alternative to generating ONQI scores separately for each food
item (the food-by-food method) and then aggregating those
scores. A comparison of the 2 methods using small test sets
(L Rhee, VY Njike, DL Katz, unpublished data, November 2009)
indicates that, because of the differential handling of various food
categories by the ONQI algorithm (eg, nutrients are capped in
fortified/processed foods, but are given unrestricted credit in
foods direct from nature), the composite recipe method tends to
compress the range of scores by contributing an upward bias to
the lowest scores and a downward bias to the highest scores. In
the context of the intended analysis, this is a bias toward the null.
Because the glycemic load enters into the ONQI algorithm se-
lectively for certain foods (eg, food containing grains and/or
added sugar) on the basis of standard US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration serving sizes, the composite recipe method pre-
cluded the use of the glycemic load for the NHANES data.
Analysis of the DASH diet was performed both with and without
the glycemic load; comparison to the NHANES data was done by
excluding the glycemic load to establish comparability. For the
DASH meal plan analysis, menu items were entered in the
Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR; reference 20)
software to generate nutrient data for each day of the DASH
eating plan. NDSR is a windows-based dietary analysis program
designed for the collection and analyses of 24-h dietary recalls
and the analysis of food records, menus, and recipes. Calculation
of nutrients occurs immediately, which provides data per in-
gredient, food, meal, and day in report and analysis file formats.
Menu items from the DASH eating plan were entered in the
NDSR software with the stated household measures for servings.
Generic food items were used. For recipe items, the amount of
each recipe item was then divided by the total number of servings
to obtain the appropriate, single-serving entry. All nutrient con-
centrations were then converted to per 100 g for standardization
for each day of the DASH eating plan. The ONQI score for a 7-d
DASH eating plan was determined by aggregating scores for each
day and computing the mean with the corresponding 95% CI.
The NHANES analysis was based on data from those partic-
ipants providing complete, reliable dietary interviews on day 1 in
NHANES 2003­2006. The same basic approach that was taken to
calculate ONQI scores for the DASH diet was applied to
NHANES. Nutrients were tabulated for the total dietary intake
from each 24-h recall in NHANES by using the composite recipe
scoring method. Food composition data, ie, the amounts per 100 g
of each nutrient contained in a food, were multiplied by the number
of 100-g weight portions of food consumed, and the nutrient intake
obtained from each food was summed over the entire day.
US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies (FNDDS) versions 2 and 3 were used to assess
intakes in NHANES 2003­2004 and NHANES 2005­2006, re-
spectively. The FNDDS includes a "recipe" database called the
Standard Reference (SR)-Link because it is used to cross-
reference the survey food codes with the appropriate version of
the NDSR. The SR-20 is the most recent release of the Standard
Reference, and it was used with FNDDS 3.0 to calculate intakes
in NHANES 2005­2006. The SR-18 is used with the FNDDS 2.0
because it was current when the NHANES 2003­2004 was
conducted. Nutrients included in the FNDDS have complete
information in the SR database. Two separate sets of recipe
calculations--one for foods in NHANES 2003­2004 and the
other for foods in NHANES 2005­2006--were done to de-
termine the individual amino acid, vitamin D, and trans fat
content of survey foods by using the FNDDS recipe database
appropriate for the respective survey time period. Bioflavanoid
data were not available for composite recipes and therefore were
omitted from both the DASH and the NHANES analyses.
The association between ONQI diet scores and the Healthy
Eating Index (HEI) 2005 was assessed by examining the distri-
bution and mean ONQI scores among groups defined by different
levels of the HEI 2005. The Student's t test and analysis of var-
iance were used to assess between-group differences in the mean
ONQI diet scores; chi-square testing was used for testing of or-
dinal variables. Spearman's correlation and linear regression were
used to assess the association between the HEI 2005 and ONQI
scores. A test for linearity (ie, test for trends) was also performed.
Covariates including age, sex, and race-ethnicity were included in
the analyses when testing for between-group differences and
trends. All data were sample-weighted by using the day 1 dietary
sampling weight, and all NHANES analyses were performed by
using SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC) to adjust variance estimates for homogeneity
because of the clustered sample design.
Finally, 2 assessments that were ongoing at the time that this
article was submitted have resulted in preliminary data. The first
of these is an assessment of changes in purchase patterns fol-
lowing the implementation of the NuVal system by retail

supermarkets (n = 526 at time of submission). Specifically,
participating retailers are monitoring the shift in sales data pre
and post NuVal implementation by examining the distribution of
within-category (eg, yogurt, breakfast cereal) NuVal scores.
The second of these, which is being conducted independently
by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, is
assessing the association between aggregated ONQI scores and
the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (21), the HEI 2005, and
a short list of salient health outcomes, which includes the total
burden of incident chronic disease, incident diabetes, incident
cancer, and incident cardiovascular events. Preliminary data have
now been generated. For statistical analyses, SAS software for
WINDOWS version 9.1 or SUDAAN 10.0 is being used. Sig-
nificance is defined as a P value ,0.05 with a 2-tailed a.
RESULTS
The results of the correlational analysis between ONQI scores/
rankings and the mean ranking of the expert panel are shown in
Table 3. Overall, the correlation was excellent both across and
within food categories.
The ONQI score associated with the DASH diet was 46 (95%
CI: 40, 53). The ONQI score associated with the NHANES 2003­
2006 cohort (n = 15,900) by using comparable methods was 26.5
(95% CI: 26.4, 26.6; P , 0.01). It is worth noting that the ONQI
algorithm was designed to place foods, not diets, on a 100-point
scale, and thus the absolute numbers in this case are un-
important; the differentiation of scores was the pertinent finding.
The distribution of both ONQI raw scores (unadjusted to the
100-point scale) and the 1­100 scores used in the NuVal system in
the NHANES 2003­2006 cohort is shown in Table 4. The as-
sociation between raw ONQI scores and the adjusted NuVal
scores with quartiles of the HEI 2005 was significant (P , 0.01)
by chi-square, as shown in Table 5. The results of linear re-
gression of the ONQI raw scores and NuVal 1­100 scale on the
HEI 2005 are shown in Table 6. Both models, adjusted for age,
race, and sex, were significant (P , 0.0001).
The results of focus group tests were qualitative. In all 3 groups,
a need for greater clarity in nutrition guidance was expressed,
along with support for both the general ONQI concept and its
expression on the 100-point scale. Face validity was judged by
the consumer group's ability to understand and apply ONQI
guidance.

expert rankings was thus limited, there was no true disagreement in metrics
for this category.

The first quantitative consumer study in November 2007
recruited 454 participants, who were all women meeting the
stated eligibility criteria. Of these, 86% responded "agree" or
"strongly agree" to the statement that the system would affect
their decisions about which foods to purchase in the grocery store.
By using these same 2 responses from a 5-point Likert scale as the
benchmark, 93% indicated that the system would help them in
making purchase decisions; 74% indicated that they would be
more likely to buy a product labeled with the ONQI than one
without. Two-thirds of the respondents (66%) indicated that they
would be more likely to shop at a grocery store that used the
system than at one that did not.
For the March 2008 consumer survey, 350 respondents meeting
eligibility criteria were enrolled; 48% were male. Again by using
the 2 "top box" responses from a 5-point Likert scale as the
benchmark, 87% of this group thought that the system was be-
lievable, and 85% thought it was unique. More than three-fourths
of the participants (77%) indicated the system would affect their
purchase intent. If offered the ONQI system with a 100-point
scale, or a system with just 4 tiers, 75% expressed a preference for
the more detailed guidance of the 100-point scale.
Finally, early data are available from 2 ongoing evaluations.
Participating retailers have reported initial point-of-purchase
data that suggests shifts within product categories from items
with lower to those with higher NuVal scores (A Maggi,
NuVal, personal communication, 2009). Aggregated data for
food-frequency questionnaires collected from 70,000 women in
the Nurses' Health Study and 40,000 men in the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-up Study in 1986 indicate that weighted mean
ONQI values are significantly inversely associated with the total
chronic disease burden, which includes diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and cancer. In this analysis, NuVal is associated with
lower relative risk values and narrower confidence intervals in the
top compared with the bottom quintiles than the HEI 2005 (WC
Willett, personal communication, January 2010).
DISCUSSION
Assessment of the performance characteristics of the ONQI
used in the NuVal nutritional guidance system began by estab-
lishing consensus within the multidisciplinary group of nutrition
and public health scientists who collaborated on its development
and proceeded to encompass consumer testing, correlational
analysis of food lists ranked by experts, and testing of the dis-
criminating capacity of the scoring system at the level of the
whole diet. Such testing thus far suggests that the algorithm
functions as intended and performs reliably against expert
opinion and validated measures of diet quality alike while
generating strong support from representative consumers in
market research. In addition, preliminary data suggest that the
intended effects are occurring at the point-of-purchase as shifts
occur within product categories from lower- to higher-scoring
items after the posting of NuVal scores on shelf tags. Unpublished
data from the Harvard School of Public Health (S Chiuve and WC
Willett, December 2009) suggest that ONQI scores aggregated to
reflect overall diet quality may be more strongly predictive of
major health outcomes than the HEI 2005.
NuVal, the organization that oversees the application of the
ONQI system in the marketplace, in conjunction with retail
partners offering the program in their stores, is studying the point-
of-purchase effects. These ongoing efforts include intercept
interviews with shoppers, online surveys of loyal shoppers,
surveys of retail receipts, and detailed analyses of sales trends,
with a particular focus on products within specific categories.
Data collection is currently under way in 3 regional supermarket
chains, totaling .520 individual stores, and will be conducted at
new sites as supermarket additional chains roll out the program.
Current program status will continuously be accessible at http://
www.nuval.com.
There are a number of other nutrition guidance systems in the
United States (12, 13) and even more globally. Systems are in
varying stages of implementation and evaluation; some have been
used as a basis for national nutrition policy (22), and others seem
to remain principally in the realm of theory (23).
The topic has been addressed periodically in the peer-reviewed
literature (24), and the level of prevailing interest is suggested
by 2 d of public hearings on front-of-package nutrition guidance
(25) convened by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of
2007 and more recently by the announcement of direct federal
oversight (26).
Although scientific support for NuVal is relatively strong and
positioned to become stronger in the near term, it should be noted
that neither NuVal nor any other system thus far is backed by
what would be truly conclusive science: a prospective assessment
of real-world populations that uses various nutrition guidance
systems to determine which results in the greatest net improve-
ments in food selection, diet quality, and health outcomes. Pro-
spective, controlled, real-world evaluation of any single system
will be costly in time, money, and effort. Even then, the ideal
standard, a direct comparison among alternative systems, would
be lacking. Perhaps such evidence will be garnered in time, but if
so, it will come neither quickly, easily, nor inexpensively. Public
health practice, business practice, and policy decisions will need
to be based on lesser standards of evidence in the interim.
Among the standards of scientific validation currently in use,
the one that seems to be most emphasized is the assessment of
correlation between nutrient profiling systems and measures of
dietary quality, in particular derivatives of the HEI (27, 28). As
noted here, NuVal has embraced this standard for initial vali-
dation testing as well. The standard, however, is intrinsically
flawed and thus should be interpreted cautiously.
The measure of the nutritiousness or nutritional quality at the
level of a food, and the level of the whole diet, are distinct.

Whereas broccoli, spinach, and blueberries are universally rec-
ognized as highly nutritious foods--and thus should be scored as
such by any competent nutrient profiling system--a diet com-
posed exclusively of broccoli, or spinach, or blueberries would be
a very poor diet indeed. Considerations of balance, variety,
complementarity, and the distribution of foods across categories
are irrelevant at the level of a single food choice, but are fun-
damental to the establishment of a healthful diet. In this context,
the correlation between the ONQI and HEI 2005 as shown thus
far is very encouraging both for being strong and for not being too
strong. The distinction between measures of food quality and diet
quality is reflected in the development of a derivative of the ONQI
algorithm for measurement of total diet quality, which is cur-
rently undergoing initial testing.
There is precedent in other areas to suggest that clear, un-
ambiguous, expert guidance should be offered to consumers in
response to an obvious need. The utility of GPS systems for
geographical navigation is beyond dispute. The goal of nutrient
profiling is quite similar, namely to help people navigate reliably
and as effortlessly as possible through a complex dietary land-
scape to the more nutritious food options available to them.
Two challenges posed to the NuVal system include its com-
plexity and transparency, both of which are included among the
criteria used to judge the quality of nutrition guidance systems
endorsed by the ONQI Scientific Advisory Board (Table 7).
Regarding the first, the food supply in the United States has
.150,000 distinct food items; the inventory of the average su-
permarket is nearly 50,000 items. Therefore, a wide variety of
nutrient considerations is necessary to adjudicate the overall
nutritional quality of all foods available to consumers. A nutrient
profiling system must either ignore, or address, such issues as
pure compared with processed, artificially sweetened, fortified,
or intrinsically rich in nutrients, etc. The ONQI algorithm ex-
plicitly addresses all of these and many related considerations.
Although the resulting algorithm is complex, the output offers
turn-key simplicity: the higher the number, the more nutritious
the food. The ONQI achieves appropriately complex function-
ality while preserving simplicity of form. The comprehensive-
ness of the algorithm has allowed for the successful scoring of
.40,000 diverse foods to date.
Regarding transparency, the basic contents of the algorithm
have been previously published (13) and are posted online (29).
This level of transparency is, in fact, rather comparable to that of
the branded food products NuVal is used to score because these
products list their ingredients but do not publish their recipe.
Even the full ONQI "recipe" can be shared, and has been, under
conditions of assured confidentiality. The algorithm is currently
in use at the Harvard School of Public Health to support ongoing
research there, and it has been shared with other independent
researchers as well. However, it must be conceded that the full
algorithm ('20 pages of computer programming written in the
SAS language) is simply not accessible to the average reader
and that specific numerical values in the formula are currently
withheld except under terms of confidentiality.
There are, of course, important limitations to the scientific
assessment of the NuVal program. First, there is no established
gold standard for the measurement of nutritional quality at
the level of a single food. NuVal testing has used prevailing
metrics--both the consensus opinion of impartial experts and the
validated measures of dietary quality--for comparison. But
neither of these is itself well validated as a reliable measure of the
overall nutritional quality of any given food.
Second, there were some specific methodologic limitations to
each of the steps of ONQI-related research to date. Consumer
research was outsourced to a marketing research group. Although
the methods used were reliably state-of-the-art, there is the
possibility that some bias was introduced. Diet testing required
use of the composite recipe method, which is more efficient than
the food-by-food method, but less capable of fine discrimination.
The composite recipe method required omitting the selective use
of both the glycemic load and bioflavanoid entries called for in
the NuVal program. These omissions further reduce the dis-
criminating capacity of the ONQI and compress the range of
scores achieved at the level of the total diet. This may lead to
a reduced capacity to show score variation at the level of diet and
TABLE 7
Criteria for an optimal nutrient profiling system per the Overall Nutritional
Quality Index Scientific Advisory Board
Criterion Explanation
Adaptable Although dietary guidelines are generated for the population
at large, they are adjusted for subpopulations with or at
risk for an array of health conditions. An optimal nutrient
profiling system should be designed similarly so that
derivatives for specific subpopulations (eg, patients with
diabetes) may be readily constructed. This requires the
inclusion of epidemiologic considerations (ie, how
nutrient properties relate to actual health effects).
Comprehensive An optimal system of nutrient profiling should incorporate
all aspects of nutritional composition that contribute
meaningfully to overall nutritional quality.
Generalizable An optimal nutrient profiling system should generate scores
for all foods, including branded items, commodity items,
recipes, and meals; should allow for comparison on
a single, universal scale both within and across food
categories; and should offer sufficiently fine
discrimination to provide meaningful guidance among
the choices in any food category.
Impartial A nutrient profiling system should be free of conflicts of
interest and developed and maintained by entities
uninvolved in the manufacture or sale of specific food
products.
Simple Nutrient profiling should be clear, unambiguous, and
interpretable at a glance by virtually any consumer.
Sophisticated The modern food supply is not simple because it contains
natural and highly processed foods; foods with intrinsic
nutrients and foods fortified with nutrients; and
macronutrient food substitutes, etc. A nutrient profiling
system suitable for applying a common metric to the
whole food supply must address these complexities.
Summative A useful nutrient profiling system should generate a single,
aggregated measure of the various inputs so that
a summary measure of overall nutritional quality is
produced.
Timely A useful nutrient profiling system must be updated in an
impartial manner and at suitable intervals to keep it
current with regard to changes in nutrition science, the
food supply, and/or the prevailing epidemiology.
Transparent The methods, measures, and assumptions on which
a nutrient profiling system is based should be sufficiently
transparent to the scientific community and to consumers
alike so that a clear understanding of how the algorithm
works is attained.

thus to a reduced capacity to show a gradient in scores between
a healthful (eg, DASH) and a typical (eg, NHANES) dietary
pattern along with a reduced correlation between ONQI scores
and gradients in another metric such as the HEI. Sample testing of
the composite recipe scoring method used showed just this effect.
Despite the introduction of such negative-effect bias, the results
of diet testing achieved statistical significance. Thus it is
expected, albeit not assured, that the results of ongoing study that
uses more robust and labor-intensive food-by-food scoring
methods will provide stronger support for NuVal.
In conclusion, NuVal provides a single, summative score for
the overall nutritional quality of a food or recipe. The system,
which scores foods from 1 to 100 (the higher the number, the
more nutritious the food) is now reaching consumers in .520
supermarkets in 19 states with many more scheduled to join over
the next 18 mo. Over 40,000 food items have been scored to
date, and additions to the list are made daily.
To the best of our knowledge, NuVal uses the most compre-
hensive nutrient profiling system yet devised by encompassing an
array of relevant nutrient entries, as well as by weighting nutrients
on the basis of epidemiologic considerations. In assessments to
date, the system has performed well in consumer testing, in
comparison with expert opinion, and in comparison with
established measures of diet quality. Preliminary data further
suggest the intended effects at the point of purchase and a strong,
inverse association between aggregated NuVal scores and actual
health outcomes in 110,000 men and women.
The ultimate test of nutrient guidance systems is a prospective
comparison among free-living and comparable populations who
are monitored for differences in both dietary pattern and health
outcomes. While waiting for that, assessment of competing
systems by an independent authority, such as the Institute of
Medicine, would be welcome. In the interim, NuVal offers
guidance that is fully independent of food industry interests and
has a solid basis in scientific evaluation.
