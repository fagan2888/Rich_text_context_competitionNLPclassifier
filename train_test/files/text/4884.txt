Introduction
Issues related to health enjoy a high level of acceptance
among the general public, which is logical when one recalls
that health is one of the main interests of the citizenry (Shah,
2011). In Spain, concretely, the latest barometers of the Centre
of Sociological Studies (CIS) show an increase in concern
about the health services in general. According to the 2014
Health Barometer (CIS; January-December), health is the
sixth area of interest to the citizenry, whereas the CIS
Barometer of December 2015 reports that health is the sixth
problem of greatest concern (11.9%), a figure that has risen
considerably since 2007, when it stood at 5.8%, according to
the same source. It should also be recalled that health is a
regular topic of informal conversation among the population.
Naturally, for many years, the mass media have responded
to the citizens' interest in acquiring useful data and knowl-
edge to improve their quality of life. In reality, the mass
media have always offered content, suggestions, and guide-
lines that readers can apply at a given moment, which is
directly related to the so-called "social responsibility" of the
press (Scott, 1987, p. 3). Furthermore, over the last decades,
there has been an increase in health content in all media and
media formats, in addition to the appearance of new journals
on health and wellness (Salmon & Atkin, 2003). This expan-
sion has been attributed to different circumstances, such as
the boom in consumption, the aging of the population or the
trend of body worship, and the consumption of information
and products on beauty, nutrition, and aesthetics (Peñafiel,
Camacho, Aiestaran, Ronco, & Echegaray, 2014, p. 137).
The usefulness, or service, provided by such media con-
tent on health and wellness appears to be closely linked to
their preventive and educational function (Scott, 1987). It is
a question of placing emphasis on the need to act before dis-
eases occur, laying the foundations so that society incorpo-
rates healthy habits into its lifestyle, insofar as "preventive
measures contribute necessary advice to avoid contracting
particular diseases" (Pena de Oliviera, 2006, p. 143). This is
possible thanks to the use of an easily understandable lan-
guage with the aim of informing, interpreting, and explain-
ing the facts clearly and impartially.
This article analyzes the information and advertising on
health and wellness in non­daily free magazines, aimed at
the general public and published in Spain, with a clearly

Features and Dimensions of Health Care
Journalism: A Case Study on Spanish Free
Magazines
Ainara Larrondo Ureta1 and Teresa Santos Diez1
Abstract
More and more individuals are turning to the mass media in search of information related to health care. Moreover, health
care accounts for an important percentage of modern economies and household expenses. Since the 1990s, this demand has
been to a degree satisfied by free healthcare magazines that offer useful advice and information related to health services and
wellness. As the article argues, Spain can be a representative case for analyzing the health care magazine phenomenon. Using
a methodology based on quantitative and qualitative variables, the article synthesizes the results of a broader research project
carried out between 2012 and 2015, focusing on the news content and advertising in three free health and wellness magazines
aimed at the general public in Spain: El Periódico de la Farmacia (The Pharmacy Newspaper), Estar bien (Feeling Well), and
Health 21 (Salud 21). The conclusions discuss the main features and dimensions of these publications from an educational
and social viewpoint, considering their fight for survival in an environment conditioned by financial crisis, competition from
online publications, and the decrease in advertising and marketing specializing in health.

educational and preventive intention. These are magazines
that readers request free of charge, typically distributed in
bulk to hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes, sports centers,
and other public locations linked to health and wellness.
Previously published research on health journalism dif-
fers from our main objective, as it examines the coverage of
health issues either from the viewpoint of specialized profes-
sional publications or from the perspective of periodical pub-
lications aimed at the general public that are not free of
charge (Costa, 2008; Dentzer, 2009; González, 2004; Kline,
2006; Molyneux & Holton, 2015; Peñafiel et al., 2014;
Revuelta, 2006; Salmon & Atkin, 2003; Schwitzer, 2010;
Seale, 2003). Although it is true that there have been numer-
ous studies on free-distribution publications aimed at the
general public (Núñez, 2013; Santos, 2008), to date no stud-
ies have analyzed media content on free health publications,
at least not with a direct approach to the question (Martínez,
Reig, & Marín, 2013; Schutz, 2009; Wofford, Pinson,
Folmar, & Moran, 1995).
That is why this research aims to contribute to filling a
vacuum and to deepening understanding of this phenomenon
on health media content. With this purpose, the study consid-
ered the following specific research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the characteristics of
free-distribution health and wellness magazines?
Research Question 2: Do these free magazines promote
genuine health journalism?
Research Question 3: What is their significance from the
viewpoint of the health-focused advertising and manage-
ment strategy?
This study is of interest due to the current need to under-
stand the keys to the communicative phenomenon of free
magazines with health content. Not only in the media context
of the web, where there has been a proliferation of content on
health in recent years, but most especially in the traditional
field of the printed press, an area conditioned by a business
model in crisis that is acquiring particular features in the case
of the free press.
Specifically, this research on the process of elaborating
information on health and wellness has taken account of the
need of determining the role played by the publications ana-
lyzed as an instrument that channels the interest of citizens in
health questions.
The main hypothesis of the research suggests that the free
distribution of these publications determines a distinctive
educational and preventive approach closely related to an
advertising and marketing aim and, in general, to the sales
objectives of those companies related to health from a gen-
eral point of view (pharmaceutical, health tourism, services
for the third age, etc.). In this sense, their content offers
information on general aspects, but in a proportion that
makes it possible to fill the existing vacuum in health cover-
age in the general press. The study, thus, considers other
premises, such as the importance of specialized advertising
for the survival of printed publications in times of crisis, in
contrast to the sustained and growing consumption of web-
sites carrying information on health.
Study Case Description and Context
In the light of the objectives and hypothesis described above,
the study consisted in analyzing three free health care maga-
zines with less than a decade of existence--El Periódico de
la Farmacia (The Pharmacy Newspaper; 2005), Estar Bien
(Feeling Well; 2007), and Salud 21 de la Región de Murcia
(Health 21 of the Region of Murcia; 2008), all of them
audited by the PGD (Publicaciones Gratuitas Ejemplares
Distribuibles), the Spanish Office of Free Publications and
Distributable Copies1 (Table 1). In this respect, similar pub-
lications that were not audited by the PGD were omitted,
such as Farmaex (2002), a publication distributed in the
region of Extremadura.
In December 2005, the Publishing Group Sanidad
Ediciones, S.L. (Saned) and the distributor Cofares launched
El Periódico de la Farmacia. This publication is distributed
in some 13,000 pharmacies, although its content is also
available in an online edition. When this magazine first came
out it had an average of 48 pages per month, although
between 2009 and 2011, its number of pages fell to 32. In
2012, it carried out another adjustment and began to publish
only 16 pages per month. El Periódico de la Farmacia came
out with a print run of 299,571, which fell to 239,102 copies
per month in 2012, as certified by the PGD.
This publication has six main sections--disorders,
healthy mind, better to prevent, learn to, women's health, and
exercise. The greater part of its informative content covers
everything related to women's health, especially from the
point of view of the most common diseases and the most
innovative diagnostic techniques. In fact, in its readers' pro-
file, there is a predominance of women (66%) in comparison
with men (33%), with an age group of readers between 35
and 54 years. It is also relevant that 63% of its readers take
the journal home, which raises the audience figure to 4.29
readers per copy. Besides being monitored by the PGD, this
publication belongs to the Asociación Española de la Prensa
Gratuita (AEPG; Spanish Free Press Association). In the
year 2015, El Periódico de la Farmacia began to be distrib-
uted monthly, and finally closed in December. As stated by
its editor, Alicia Martínez, this magazine was the leader in
the sector in 2011 according to the OJD (Oficina de
Justificación de la Difusión, Circulation Audit Bureau). As
the interviewed pointed out, this magazine aims to offer a
service to those communities in which it is distributed, main-
taining a good relationship with different agents, such as
nonprofit organizations. The journal Estar Bien, published
by Contenidos e Información de Salud, S.L. until April 2014
and by Wecare-U from this date onward, was first published
on January 26, 2007. Even if Estar Bien had traditionally a
Larrondo and Santos 3
very wide network of distribution points, in the last years this
magazine reduced these to pharmacies and centers where
sporting activities were practiced. Its print run in 2012 was
reduced by half in 2014, falling from 300,000 copies to
150,000. From 2012 onward, it began a process of change
and its number of pages per month fell to 32, until its
closure.
According to data obtained from the in-depth interview
with its editor, Lucía Barrera, Estar Bien can be considered
as the "first health newspaper" with "information inviting
you to improve the quality of life and enjoyment of leisure."
The aim of this magazine is to reach the entire public through
strategic points. In fact, as the interviewee pointed out, its
launch sought "a new form of understanding information on
health,"', as it was "a newspaper that tackled wellness in its
widest sense, from the prevention of disease to care and the
promotion of healthy habits. These were our principles."
Estar Bien came out with a weekly periodicity and a national
distribution (Table 1). Its print run2 initially reached 300,000
copies that were distributed in hospitals, hotels, health
resorts, pharmacies, and much-frequented places, like means
of transport. From 2012 onward, the publishing company
decided to concentrate the publication at strategic points like
fitness and wellness centers, and pharmacies. In fact, in
January 2012, the publication defined itself as a "free maga-
zine on lifestyle." In the words of Barrera, the change at this
stage went further than what can be seen at first sight. From
this time onward, the publication gave increasing importance
to strategies of transversal collaboration with other media
like the Intereconomía television channel, as well as to strat-
egies on social networks, especially on Twitter and Facebook.
In its pages, Estar Bien includes the following sections:
communication, looking after yourself well, menus, drinks,
sport, feeling well, prevention, living well, and travel. With
respect to the profile of its readers, the majority of its public
is formed of women (67%) aged between 25 and 54 years,
with higher education. This reader type is concerned about
bodily well-being, regularly practices some type of sport,
travels, and consumes beauty products. She or he dedicates
approximately 28 min to reading Estar Bien, and 60% decide
to take the copy home.
The third publication analyzed, Salud 21 de la Región de
Murcia, was launched in March 2008, with a fortnightly
periodicity and a print run of 26,000 copies, on the initia-
tive of the company Ediciones Vitalidad y Progreso, S.L.
According to its editor, Alfonso Celestino, this magazine
has managed to maintain its print run at 29,000 copies. In
2014, its number of pages increased and from then on it has
published between 64 and 80 pages. This magazine carries
out most of its distribution at the entrances of the big hospi-
tals in Murcia with the aim of reaching health personnel
and patients. The promoter interviewed defined this maga-
zine as a health newspaper, whereas its front page currently
describes it as "The newspaper of wellness." As in the case
of Estar Bien, an evolution can be seen in the concept and
aims pursued by this publication, distributed in health-
related centers--public and private hospitals, health insur-
ers, old people's homes, hotels, health resorts, and
pharmacies in urban areas of Murcia. Starting in May 2010,
Salud 21 diversified its business toward sectors related to
the trade in medical, orthopedic, optical equipment and
instruments, cosmetics, hygiene, and herbal remedies. Like
the other publications of this type, Salud 21 also has a web
edition that is updated weekly.
Several criteria were followed in the process of testing the
representativeness of the publications examined. First, the
study considers all the free health care magazines published
in Spain with quality control auditing (PGD).

Specifically, the media studied are classified as periodical
printed publications of thematic interest (health and well-
ness), whose aims are focused on the general public (custom-
ers of pharmacies, hospital patients, and residents of old
people's homes), made available to the public at regular
intervals of time, with the same title, in a continuous series,
with the date and correlative numbering. This characteriza-
tion makes it possible to differentiate the publications exam-
ined from others that are apparently similar in their subject
and aims, but very different due to their classification. Such
is the case of publications that are classified differently as
"pharmacy periodicals," which is the case with Consejos de
tu Farmacéutico (Advice From Your Chemist), published by
the Grupo Difusiones Tecnológicas de Mercado (DTM). In
addition, the publications selected are differentiated from
others with a greater degree of specialization, as they are
publications aimed at an expert and professional public.
Besides their large print run and their diffusion being
audited by the PGD, the publications were considered
according to the following indicators:
·
· Characteristics of their promoters: These are consoli-
dated companies with a wide presence and experience
in the publishing sector on health, with specialized
publications both for qualified health personnel and,
in the case of the publications analyzed in this article,
for the general public.3
·
· They represent different geographical settings, that is,
national and regional coverage.
·
· Easy access by the public, given that they are free and
distributed through pharmacies and other centers
related to health.
It is important to call attention to the fact that the maga-
zines analyzed were launched between 2005 and 2008, when
the economic crisis was already a reality at the world level
and was causing a clear fall in advertising investment, which
placed publishing companies in a difficult situation. Even so,
while the free general information newspapers were obliged
by market contingencies to close delegations, sack person-
nel, reduce the number of their pages, and print run, the pub-
lications examined have managed to survive and remain on
the market by taking certain measures--concentration of dis-
tribution points in strategic zones of cities, cutting costs,
lengthening the periodicity of distribution, and reduction in
the number of fixed pages.
Sampling and Method
This study considers a sample of issues published in different
phases, between the months of August 2012 and August
2014, and the months of June and December 2015. This sam-
ple procedure aimed to analyze representative issues from
two relevant phases: The first phase refers to a moment of
ordinary development and circulation, whereas the second
one refers to the opening of a period of crisis, due to several
factors considered in the study and explained below. In total,
the study considered a sample of 94 issues (2,602 pages),
divided as follows: El Periódico de la Farmacia (22 issues,
352 pages), Estar Bien (19 issues, 626 pages), and Salud 21
de la Región de Murcia (53 issues, 1,624 pages). These three
publications represent free press models that have been able
to adapt to market circumstances, constantly seeking more
adequate solutions to subsist. Some of them have also shown
a thematic and functional evolution, such as Estar Bien,
which has progressed from being considered a health maga-
zine to one focused on "lifestyle."
Methodologically, the study adopted the qualitative and
descriptive technique of content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon,
2005; Krippendorff, 1990), due to its utility for examining
published texts in a systematic and objective way, as well as
for quantifying the materials of the research To apply this
qualitative procedure, we opted for the case study, with the
understanding that this analytical form is more suitable for
obtaining an in-depth understanding of what is subjected to
research, and also due to its validity for establishing general
theoretical propositions (Yin, 2002).
With the purpose of completing the main results of the
study, other qualitative techniques were applied, such as
semistructured interviews with those in charge of these pub-
lications. Interviews were carried out with the editors of the
free-distribution publications analyzed. Questions were
related to the characteristics of these publications, such as
their aims, objectives, and financing, as well as to other ques-
tions, such as their relationship with advertisers and their
general viewpoint on the sector of free-distribution publica-
tions and health.
The analysis was also completed by consulting different
sources like the AEPG and the PGD)of the OJD, as well as
different documents such as health reports, reports by official
bodies, and other sources related to the question.
The information or media content was codified according
to 13 representative thematic categories related to health and
wellness: general health, specialized women's health, spe-
cialized men's health, specialized children's health, special-
ized third age health, agenda, current affairs on news,
nutrition, beauty and wellness, psychiatry/psychology, lei-
sure, sports, and others (Table 2). Following the same line,
advertising was analyzed on the basis of the following cate-
gories: medicines, nutrition, beauty, reforms, clinics, sales,
institutional, vehicles, banks, telephony, funerary, old peo-
ple's homes, lawyers, leisure, clairvoyance, orthopedic, and
self-advertising.
Results
Although all the front pages of the publications analyzed
deal with health content, their approaches vary significantly
(Table 2). Thus, in El Periódico de la Farmacia, questions
related to alimentation and beauty stand out in equal
Larrondo and Santos 5
proportion, although questions dedicated to women's health
are the priority. Estar Bien also prioritizes alimentation, as
well as questions of psychiatry and psychology, with a
greater proportion than the other publications. In Salud 21,
current affairs in health account for the greatest percentage
of content.
To achieve the publication's educational aim, and so
that its message on health reaches a nonspecialized gen-
eral public with clarity and without creating confusion or
false expectations, it is important for there to be qualified
personnel in the newsroom. This is the only way to ensure
that the information is rigorous and focuses on basic ques-
tions, excluding irrelevant data that might lead to sensa-
tionalism or create false expectations in the audience. In
this context, the journalist's role must be focused on
"reporting with the peculiarities of health language, char-
acterized by the technical terms of the scientific area," but
making it into a language that is understandable to the
public in general.
With respect to the authorship of the news reports (Table
3), only in El Periódico de la Farmacia is the authorship of
the information not given in any cases, in spite of the fact that
the group that publishes it, Saned, has over 50 professionals
and 400 external collaborators, including specialists in com-
munication, "medical writers," experts in marketing, health
managers, designers, and programmers. News agencies only
have a significant presence in Salud 21.
As Table 4 shows, the magazines examined provide
healthy guidelines and habits with suggestions aimed at
improving frequent health problems and diseases like osteo-
porosis, rheumatism, osteoarthritis or lower back pain, sleep-
ing problems, obesity and how to deal with it through
balanced diets, exercise, and, as a last resort, surgical inter-
vention. Regardless of the ailment they are dealing with, they
describe the disease, risk factors, symptoms, prevention, and
recommendations.
Women's health is considered by dealing with the different
stages of their lives. Particular attention is given to gyneco-
logical specialties (assisted reproduction, pregnancy, meno-
pause, etc.). Salud 21 dedicated a special 11-page monograph
to such content. The specific ailments of men are also cov-
ered, although to a lesser degree. Specific guidelines and
information are included for elderly people dealing with the
characteristic ailments of that age, such as dementia, dental
health problems, infectious processes, cardiovascular altera-
tions, osteoarthritis, and pain--the most frequent reasons for
medical consultations among the population over 65 years.
The content of Salud 21 is directed at older people, and it
is thus not surprising that its pages deal with these frequent
diseases with instructions on how to prevent them or improve
their condition. Nor is the childhood stage ignored, with
advice and suggestions for preventing diseases.
The diary of events and organizations is also a service
worth highlighting in this type of publications. Salud 21 pro-
vides a complete guide to associations of people with ail-
ments, like Adirmu (diabetes), On-Off Association
(Parkinson's disease), Asociación de Ayuda al Enfermo
Renal (ADAER) (renal patients), Asociación Murciana Virus
Inmunodeficiencia Humana (AMUVIH) (HIV patients),
Multiple Sclerosis, among others. In addition, it provides
numerous addresses of health centers and hospitals in the
province.
In the texts analyzed, all aspects of nutrition and alimenta-
tion are dealt with; advice on a balanced diet is provided, but
the need for support from a health professional is taken into
consideration. This content shows the health benefits con-
tributed by fruits and vegetables, among other foodstuffs.
Also included are recommendations from experts for reduc-
ing arterial inflammation. This content is completed with
cookery recipes, which include the ingredients needed to
feed four people, the steps to follow throughout the process,
and necessary observations for elaborating the dishes.

In addition, all the publications show an interest in current
health innovation, such as new techniques being applied in
surgical operations and new treatments.
With respect to current health issues, content is adapted
to the season in all the publications analyzed, which show
disorders and diseases related to the time of year con-
cerned. They provide detailed explanations of their pathol-
ogy, accompanied by guidelines and recommendations
with the causes, symptoms, and ways of preventing disor-
ders, such as spring asthenia, for example. In summer,
advice is given on how to combat heat and thirst with a
compendium of recommendations and suggestions for the
season, such as natural remedies for reducing the amount
of body sweat, refreshing oneself to satisfy thirst when the
sun is hottest, the importance of good hydration, and car-
ing for the skin protecting it from the sun, thus avoiding
melanomas and patches. In autumn, recommendations are
given on the use of exfoliating creams and moisturizers to
reduce the risk of suffering from different lesions. In win-
ter, flu and cold are a recurrent topic. They include
symptoms and the most used medicines, like analgesics,
antipyretics, decongestants, and antihistamines. Relevant
dates like New Year are also considered.
In the section on beauty, there is concern for the skin with
natural active products and vitamins to mitigate stains and
imperfections. Psychiatry and psychology also find a space
in their pages. Guidelines are given that can help in overcom-
ing difficult moments in life and raising morale. Attention is
given to situations of stress and disorders like anxiety,
depressions, obsessions, and other pathologies, which might
be due to the current crisis and require specific therapies. The
pages of the publications are completed with other issues of
current interest in society, like ecology.
Analysis of the advertising in the publications of the sam-
ple provides dissimilar results, as can be seen in Table 5. While
the majority of the advertising in El Periódico de la Farmacia
is about medicines, in Estar Bien the greater number of adver-
tisements is related to nutrition and aesthetics. With specific
reference to advertisements on medicines, it should be recalled
that the publisher of El Periódico de la Farmacia belongs to
the pharmaceutical sector and distributes this publication in
pharmacies. This type of advertising focuses on medicines for

health problems that are well known to the public and are easy
to obtain as they can be acquired without medical prescription.
In this way, clear commercial links are established between
the publisher, the pharmacy, and the consumer.
In Estar Bien, the secondary advertising is dedicated to ser-
vices like telephony and clairvoyance. In Salud 21, advertising
for medicines, nutrition, and beauty accounts for a small minor-
ity, as opposed to advertisements for clinics, orthopedics, and
reforms, which are nonexistent in the case of the other two pub-
lications.Also characteristic of Salud 21 is advertising that spe-
cializes in equipment and systems for assisting problems of
reduced mobility that are characteristic of the third age (scoot-
ers, wheelchairs, lifts, articulated beds, etc.). Also outstanding
in Salud 21 is advertising on old people's homes, funeral, and
juridical services, as well as advertising on product sales (digi-
tal tension meters, 20 language translators, television surveil-
lance sets, steam cleaners, etc.). As Table 5 shows, in the three
publications, the majority of the advertising specializing in
medicine focuses on the common cold (head, lower back,
joints, etc.) and sight (opticians, medicines, eye drops, etc.).
Advertising plays a decisive role in the publications in our
study as a source of funding. Not for nothing is the Grupo
Saned, the publisher of El Periódico de la Farmacia, a global
services company, responsible for advising and training
health professionals. For its part, Cofares, the distributor of El
Periódico de la Farmacia, is a leader in pharmaceutical mar-
keting in Spain, with over 4,500 pharmacies as clients and
9,654 pharmacists as cooperation partners, with a turnover in
2012 of over 2,523 million Euros. Contenidos e Informaciones
de Salud, S.L., the publisher of Estar Bien, is a novel business
model, which works in research and in the creation, consul-
tancy, design, and publishing of information related
to the sciences of health, medicine, bioscience, pharmacy,
veterinary science, and other related professions. Starting in
May 2010, the company Ediciones Vitalidad y Progreso, S.L.,
responsible for Salud 21 de la Región de Murcia, diversified
its business toward sectors related to the retail marketing of
medical, orthopedic, optical, photographic instruments and
cosmetic products (Table 6).
Discussion and Final Remarks
Following the main hypothesis of the study, the results
obtained make it possible to conclude that the free-distribution
publications on health and wellness aimed at the general pub-
lic to fulfill a priority aim: to support the activities of their
parent companies in fields outside publishing, directly through
advertising (medicines, products for the third age, etc.) and
indirectly by educating the public, and arousing its interesting
in such questions that are directly related to "quality of life."
Advertising in these publications provides important sup-
port for products related to a healthy life. As occurs in the
case of the main content, we can also note differences among
the publications in the case of advertising. Thus, El Periódico
de la Farmacia mainly dedicates its advertising space to
medicines, whereas Estar Bien gives priority to products
related to nutrition, and Salud 21 to advertising on clinics
and old people's homes.
Within the general treatment that the publications analyzed
give to questions related to health, it is possible to observe
slight specializations that give a particular personality to each
of these media. Although the publications examined dedicate
their pages to questions related to health, it is difficult to find a
topic that attains a similar index of presence in the three

publications. Thus, differences can be noted with respect to
the agenda of the main content, both on the front and inner
pages. While El Periódico de la Farmacia pays special atten-
tion to nutrition and beauty, Estar Bien gives priority to nutri-
tion and questions of psychiatry and psychology, and Salud 21
highlights current health issues. The content they include is
clearly useful, as they provide healthy guidelines and habits,
with suggestions and standards aimed at making life better.
This usefulness is also shown in content aimed at performing
a preventive function. With respect to the thematic preferences
of these publications, there is also a noticeable tendency in El
Periódico de la Farmacia and Estar Bien to increasingly
equate health with wellness or quality of life.
The publications analyzed emerged in the midst of the
economic recession and, with the exception of Salud 21, they
have not managed to subsist in the print market unlike other
free-distribution publications, which is very interesting. The
survival of Salud 21 has been possible through adaptations
(print run, periodicity, etc.), although it is still too soon to
know if these measures will continue to be effective in the
long-term. In this respect, their online versions seem to be
the solution. In their online versions, the three publications
have continued to exist, and they have sufficient potential to
develop a specific type of publication defined by greater
dynamism, thematic breadth, and interactivity.
In line with what the editors noted, journalistic content on
health aims to provide answers, offer guidelines, and provide
orientation to the reader facing a problem that directly affects
his or her life. Stated in other words, this is content that edu-
cates the population on health, with messages that are educa-
tional and useful.Thus, the general interest of the publications
that form our object of study lies in their presenting content
that is immediately useful to people, that serves to help in
daily life, encompassed in what is known as "service journal-
ism." One decisive factor is that these publications deal with
diseases and ailments that are suffered by a very significant
part of the population and that receive special recognition
through World Days. As a suggestion for future research, we
propose widening this type of analysis to other media like the
radio and television, which will also make it possible to carry
out comparative studies.
One of the main keys to the emergence of the publications
studied lies in their offering content related to health that
closely concerns the reader, employing positive approaches
that also have an educational aim, even if they entail a mar-
keting or advertising aim. The increase in information on
questions related to health in recent decades would thus be
giving a new boost to periodical publications dealing with
these issues, as well as to health-sector advertising.
Nevertheless, as a final summary, and in accordance with
the main hypothesis, the study highlights the great influence of
advertising and marketing in health journalism. This seems to
be specially significant in the case of free-distribution publica-
tions that are committed to providing educational and service
information on general and specialized health (women's and
men's health, etc.), as, for such publications, the decrease in
sales does not represent a sword of Damocles. In fact, in view
of the study results, it is possible to conclude that the publica-
tions analyzed are presented to the public as being concerned
with health education and service, while their purely marketing
and advertising aims are concealed. Continuous changes in
periodicity and number of pages clearly evidence this lack of
commitment to service information and, in contrast, a consider-
able preference for doing business through advertising.

Notes
1. When the research started, all the publications analyzed had
their distribution controlled by the Oficina de Publicaciones
Gratuitas y Ejemplares Distribuibles (PGD). The PGD's audit-
ing is a good indicator that the publications selected fulfill cer-
tain criteria of quality besides having an effective distribution.

3. Besides publishing Estar Bien, the company Contenidos e
Información de Salud, S.L. publishes another three publications
with a high degree of specialization, given that their potential
public is made up of doctors, specialists, and pharmacists.
These publications are the weeklies El Global (The Global)--
in its printed version (2000; 24,583 copies) and digital version
(2001), the Gaceta Médica Hospitalaria (Hospital Medical
Gazette; 2002; 15,435 copies), and the Revista Española de
Economía de la Salud (ReES; Spanish Journal of the Economy
of Health; 2004), aimed at those professionals who work in
the administrative and management field of the health services
(PGD: December 2013). Besides El Periódico de la Farmacia,
the company Sanidad Ediciones, S.L. (Saned; 1981) publishes
the professional journal El Médico (The Doctor; 1981; 50,858
copies), available since 1999 in an online versión: El Médico
Interactivo (The Interactive Doctor; PGD, 2012).
