Introduction
Structural symbolic interactionism emphasizes the impact of
the structures of society on individuals' interaction with oth-
ers to convey who they are, or the meanings of their identi-
ties. Self--consisting of multiple identities--emerges from
the patterned and organized social structure and therefore is
organized (Burke & Stets, 2009). In contrast, traditional
symbolic interactionism opposes any suggestion that social
structure is stable and posits that identities are fluid as indi-
viduals construct identities differently across situations.
Along the lines of structural symbolic interactionism,
identity theory specifically argues for the correspondence
between social positions in networks of social relations and
role identities such as student. Empirical work to test and
explore the relationship between identity and network char-
acteristics has appeared. McFarland and Pals (2005) opera-
tionalize ego network1 context such as prominence to predict
identity change. Walker and Lynn (2013) suggest that role
identity salience--the likelihood a role identity is enacted--
increases as role-based others are more closely connected
with non­role-based others. Stark (2015) reveals how the
tendency to avoid friends who have minority friends enables
majority group members to stay away from minority group
members.
In this article, I answer this research question: Would
Chinese respondents in the new environment of United States
but with a large portion of Chinese acquaintances in their time
network2 develop a salient/prominent ethnic identity? Time
network is composed of people with whom an individual
spends the most awake time.
Further, this article aims to clarify whether being sepa-
rated from the host culture of the United States reduces the
salience/prominence of Chinese ethnic identity, or just
among those who recently arrive in the host culture. Another
aim of this article is to investigate whether low exposure to
different cultures available in a locality reduces the salience/
prominence of Chinese ethnic identity, or just among those
who have a large Chinese cohort.
Theory and Hypotheses
Identity Prominence/Salience and Social Networks
To reiterate, identity theory posits that social positions--the
stable, morphological components of social structure--carry
the shared behavior expectations termed "roles." Role identi-
ties exist as individuals participate in structured social relation-
ships. Individuals are committed to role identities to various
degrees, dependent on the costs of losing social relations that
create behavioral expectations for roles. Such commitment can
be measured qualitatively by emotional attachment to social

Patterned Fluidity of Chinese Ethnic
Identity: Networks, Time, and Place
Cynthia Baiqing Zhang1
Abstract
This study tests the salience/prominence of Chinese ethnic identity by applying identity theory, social identity theory, and
social network analysis. Using survey data of Chinese graduate students in two universities in the United States, I show
how Chinese ethnic identity salience varies with the percentage of Chinese in an individual's ego network revolving around
him or her. In addition, among newcomers to the United States, as the percentage Chinese in ego networks increases, the
decline of Chinese identity salience/prominence declines, but for old timers in the United States, as the percentage Chinese
increases, the decline of Chinese identity salience/prominence is reversed. The ethnic identity salience lapses with time unless
the respondents keep a cohort of co-nationals. Moreover, a cosmopolitan sociocultural environment is conducive to the
maintenance of ethnic identity when an individual has many co-nationals in his or her ego network while having many co-
nationals does not stop the decline of ethnic salience in an isolated social environment.

relations in support of certain roles, or "intensivity," and quan-
titatively by the number of social relations in support of certain
roles, or "extensivity." Commitment is closely related with
identity salience that predicts the likelihood of activation of
certain identities organized in a salience hierarchy (Stryker,
1968). Given that networks of social relations are social struc-
ture (Wellman, 1988), the stable, morphological components of
social structure as proposed by identity theory, or social posi-
tions, therefore, are social positions in social networks. Identity
salience is a function of the strength and number of social rela-
tions in networks, or ties (Burke & Stets, 2009). In short,
Stryker and colleagues' work is particularly articulate on the
relationship between identity salience and social networks.
Social Identity Theory and Identity Theory
Identity theory focuses on role identity that is related to role
others. For example, a parent role is in relationship to a child
role. Social identity such as Chinese ethnic identity emph-
sizes in-group (i.e. Chinese) and out-group (i.e. non-Chi-
nese) differences. However, the argument on the relationship
between identity salience and social networks as specified
in identity theory can be extended to social identities. Phinny
(Howard, 2000) has a comprehensive review of ethnic
identity.
Identity theory scholars have actually called for a combi-
nation of identity theory and social identity theory (Stets &
Burke, 2000). Specifically, these scholars argue that the dif-
ferent bases of identity in social identity theory (category and
group) and in identity theory (role) can be combined.
Although category and group identity such as Chinese ethnic
identity emphasizes the similarities among in-group mem-
bers (Hogg, 2006) while role identity stresses differences
between roles and counter roles such as student identity and
professor identity, role identities can also be category and
group identities as students and professors are in-group and
out-group to each other. In addition, category, group, role,
and person identities all follow the same identity verification
mechanisms (Burke & Stets, 2009).
Chinese Ethnic Identity
Chinese ethnic identity is a category identity. By definition,
the Chinese ethnic identity is conditioned by the difference
between Chinese and non-Chinese as well as by the similari-
ties among Chinese as the in-group and similarities among
non-Chinese as the out-group. Therefore, a social network
measure that captures in-group out-group contrast--percent-
age of Chinese within the ego network--can be used to pre-
dict salience of Chinese ethnic identity.
In addition, because the in-group out-group contrast is key
to category/group identity, the Chinese ethnic identity of a
focal person--a Chinese person--is related with people the
focal person spends much time with. In other words, to under-
stand ethnic identity, it is necessary to know an individual's
close relationships or ties that consist of the in-group as well
as this person's acquaintances who are the out-group. Out-
group members are those who have constant presence in the
focal person's life in geographical space but remain distant in
social space. I thus use time network to delineate the relation-
ship between identity salience/prominence and ego network
characteristics.
Hypotheses
Social identity theory suggests that category identity is based
on the distinction between in-group and out-group. For the
in-group out-group distinction to maintain, there needs to be
a balance between in-group members and out-group mem-
bers in an individual's time network. Therefore, having a
high percentage of Chinese in one's time network means the
opportunity for a person to establish the distinction between
Chinese and non-Chinese is low. I hereby hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 1: Having many Chinese in the time network
is negatively related with Chinese ethnic identity for
Chinese egos.
Time is important because it takes time for identities to
internalize. In this research, I am interested in short time
spans: several months to approximately 8 years. That is, the
time span that would have an impact on a stable, cross situ-
ational identity which is the focus of this project. I examine
the impact of in-person and between-person time difference
in the United States on network and identity formation and
transformation.
In the literature of life course, Atchley (1993) suggests
that time after retirement witnesses a U-shaped development
of self-perception: honeymoon, disenchantment, reorienta-
tion, and stability. Changes in identities are constant while
continuity in identities is more powerful. In addition, Burke
maintains that identity salience decreases as individuals can-
not verify their identities. With the passage of time, Chinese
graduate students are more and more integrated into the host
culture with more non-Chinese, the opportunity for these stu-
dents to verify their Chinese identity becomes slimmer.
However, this process can reverse as these students' life
becomes stable. I hereby hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 2: Time in the United States has a U-shaped
relationship with Chinese identity.
Having a high Chinese composition in time network keeps
individuals from being in contact with the host culture and
thus reduces ethnic identity saliences. However, ethnic iden-
tity is fluid as individuals of various ethnic backgrounds are
impacted by ecological factors, such as politics in their deci-
sion to claim or reclaim their ethnic identity (Alba, 1990;
Nagel, 1994). With the passage of time, the decline of Chinese
Zhang 3
ethnic identity salience is slowed down as individuals are
integrated more into the host culture. I hereby hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 3: A longer stay in the United States will slow
down the decline of Chinese identity salience when indi-
viduals have a higher Chinese cohort composition.
Sociocultural contexts or locations in the United States,
another ecological factor influencing ethnic identity, are
important in the interaction of identity and networks of
social relations as this research is designed to test relational
identity. Identity theory defines identity as internalized
meanings existent in the culture in the larger society which
is supported by ethnic identity literature (e.g., Ichiyama,
McQuarrie, & Ching, 1996). That is, identity meanings are
culturally determined. Consequently, it is important to
explain the "cultural contingency" of a social environment
(Pachucki & Breiger, 2010, p. 205). Social relations can be
the precedence or the consequence of identities depending
on the specific social environments. A social environment
provides the cultural meanings that may be absorbed into
the self-structure, and thus constrains the types of available
identities. More complex social environments can poten-
tially generate more identities because of the many subcul-
tures existent in such environments. Social environments
also offer different types of social relations at the dyadic
and group levels which either enhance or constrain the for-
mation of new identities.
In addition, distinctiveness theory (Mehra, Kilduff, &
Brass, 1998) proposes that in a given situation, the trait such
as race that is the rarest in the crowd will draw people with
that trait together. Therefore, in an environment where ethnic
background is the rarest trait, people feel more strongly
about their ethnic identity. However, in a social context
where diverse ethnic groups are present, people feel less
strongly about their ethnic identity. I hereby hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 4: Being in Northeast City (NE) in the New
England area with exposure to various cultures is nega-
tively related to Chinese identity compared with residents
from Southeast City (SE).
As stated previously, having a high percentage Chinese in
one's network has a negative relationship with identity
salience/prominence. However, being in NE stems the
decline of Chinese ethnic identity salience/prominence
because the existence of multiple cultures renders Chinese
ethnic background a sharp contrast to the host culture in the
United States. As explained by Howard (2000), "Population
shifts, especially immigrations, are a major instigator of
changes in ethnic identities" (p. 375). I hereby hypothesize
the following:
Hypothesis 5: Being in NE slows down the decline of
Chinese ethnic identity salience at a higher Chinese
composition.
Method
Sample and Procedure
To identify patterns of linkages between ego network, time in
the United States, and localities in the United States and iden-
tity, I conducted online surveys (Sue & Ritter, 2007) with a
supplementary paper version of the surveys (Dillman, 2007;
Weiseburg, 2005) targeting the entire population of Chinese
graduate students at two universities. I used two public uni-
versities--Harmony College in SE and Diversity College in
NE as the subject frames though the subject's ego network
usually reached far beyond the boundaries of the two col-
leges, extending to the local communities and to their home
country of China, assisted by physical and electronic interac-
tion, particularly when these students first arrived in the
United States and in their interaction with their family mem-
bers back in China. Because the students from the two univer-
sities were similar in terms of educational attainment in
China, localities in China, age group, and being city residents
in China, I did not include variables associated with their
Chinese background to predict identity salience/prominence.
The survey was distributed to all Chinese graduate students
through university administrative offices. Although I did not
know the exact number of the Chinese graduate students at
Diversity College, I estimated the combined responses for the
online version of the survey from the two universities proba-
bly accounted for around 15% of the population. The print ver-
sion fared much better. The two batches of mail survey using
exactly the same online format witnessed 70% response rate.
Some responses in the second batch were not included because
they arrived later than the deadline. There were 95 total
responses to the online survey at Harmony College. At
Diversity College, there were 21 responses to the online sur-
vey and 56 responses to the print version of the online survey.
In total, Diversity College provided 77 responses to the sur-
vey. Usable responses were 119 from the two colleges which
was sufficient for a multivariate analysis (Allison, 1999).
The survey asked for the respondents'general sociodemo-
graphic information, respondents' time network, and the
importance of ethnic identity. For each person named in time
network, I asked about his or her demographics and relation-
ships with the focal person. I also asked for an aggregate
number of ties in time network. I calculated percentage of
Chinese for the networks thus obtained in the survey.
The identity salience/prominence section asked the
respondent to rate the importance of ethnic identity (Chinese
from mainland China). The question read, "We now ask the
importance of the major identities you might have. Please
drag the importance indicator along the scale 0-100, `1'being
least important and `100' the most important."
4 SAGE Open
The survey took approximately 10 to 15 min to complete
on average though some respondents took longer (20-25
min). Students read a verbal script highlighting the voluntary
nature of the questionnaire and my intent of protecting their
anonymity.
For the analysis, I used both the basic term and the qua-
dratic term of the time in the U.S. variable. First, I used per-
centage Chinese, time, a quadratic term of time, and locations
as predictors and network size as control variable. Second, I
added interaction terms of the basic term and the quadratic
term of time, with the two network measures: percentage
Chinese and network size. Third, I added the interaction
terms of location in the United States with the two network
measures. I also added another control variable of gender
with male coded as 1.
Measures
The dependent variable identity salience/prominence was
measured using a scale of identity importance ranging from
1 to 100. McCall and Simmons (1966) regard self-attrib-
uted importance of identities as the fundamental elements
of self. Although defining identity salience as behavioral
oriented, Stryker and colleagues use identity salience and
identity prominence interchangeably as a concept and mea-
sure (Stryker & Serpe, 1994).
Time in the United States was measured with years the
respondents had spent in the host country. Because the vast
majority of the respondents started their graduate program
immediately upon arrival in the host country of the United
States, I recoded time in graduate programs as time in the
United States. As a new identity for the respondents, Chinese
ethnic identity showed a trajectory in salience/prominence
with the passage of time. This identity change process is
gradual and takes place over a long period of time, ranging
from weeks to months or even years (Burke & Stets, 2009).
Location in the United States was measured by delegating
"1" to NE and "0" to Southeast city. These two locations
were selected because they demonstrated tremendous differ-
ences in ethnic compositions and degrees of cultural diver-
sity as shown in Table 1.
Major Predictor: Percentage Chinese in Ego's
Time Network
The major network measure to predict identity salience/
prominence was percentage Chinese. The percentage
Chinese measure was calculated by dividing the number of
Chinese ties within a person's time network by the person's
total number of ties. Percentage Chinese indicates a focal
person's access (Burt, 1984) to in-group members (Chinese)
and by definition nonaccess to out-group members (non-Chi-
nese). Descriptive analysis and hypotheses testing were
based on these data using Stata. The larger the percentage
Chinese measure is, the larger the Chinese in-group is for the
individual. Stated in a different way, larger percentage
Chinese measure shows that an individual was more embed-
ded in his or her home Chinese culture. Or conversely, larger
percentage Chinese measure means that an individual was
having limited contact with the host culture.
Control Variables: Network Size and Gender
I included two control variables: the size of the time network
and gender. Identity theory maintains that the number of ties
supporting an identity is important to predict identity
salience/prominence (Burke & Stets, 2009; Stryker & Serpe,
1994). Chinese and non-Chinese both functioned to help a
focal person to maintain the Chinese ethnic identity as
defined by the concept of ethnic identity. Chinese cohorts
reminded an individual of what Chinese culture specified
while non-Chinese acquaintances were a contrast group.

Gender was included as a control variable because literature
suggests people experience the host culture in the United States
differently as a result of their gender, particularly immigrants
from Asian countries (Kim, 2006; Pyke & Johnson, 2003).
Results
The demographic characteristics of the survey respondents
are presented in Table 2.
Around half of the sample was male (50%). Respondents
ranged in age from 20 to 38 years with a mean age of 27
years. Over half of the sample was from Diversity College
(54%). The length of stay in the United States ranged from 0
to 9 years, with a mean of 3.2 years.
There were two network variables included in the descrip-
tive statistics. The time network size was 3.90 on average
with a SD of 3.24. The number of ties ranged from 0 to 20.
The percentage of Chinese people in this network was high:
83.06% with a SD of 28.45%.
Results of regression analysis are presented in Table 3.
As shown in Table 3, Hypotheses 1, 3, 4, and 5 were sup-
ported. Consistent with social identity theory, having many
Chinese co-nationals in one's time network deprived a person's
opportunity to perceive the boundary between Chinese and non-
Chinese due to the lack of separation from the native Chinese
culture. Hypothesis 1 was supported that the higher percentage
ofChinesecohortsanindividualhad,thelowerhisorherChinese
ethnic identity salience/prominence ( = -.66, p < .05) was.
Contrary to the literature on the relationship between time
and identity in general, results showed no significant
U-shaped relationship between the time spent in the United
States and Chinese ethnic identity. Therefore, Hypothesis 2
was not supported. However, there was a significant negative
relationship between time spent in the United States and
Chinese ethnic identity ( = -14.93, p < .05). That is, Chinese
ethnic identity was the strongest when the respondents first
arrived in the United States and diminished as they were more
and more integrated into the host culture in the United States.
This can be because China is a highly homogeneous country
with over 90% of the population belonging to the Han ethnic
group while the host country of the United States has a very
small percentage Chinese in its population. This conclusion is
not surprising as the literature on the relationship between
time and ethnic identity does support that the length of time in
a new environment and the identification with home culture
have a negative relationship (Ichiyama et al., 1996).
The analysis also revealed a negative relationship between
being in NE and Chinese ethnic identity ( = -50.82, p <
.05). That is, being a resident of NE which is highly diverse
in racial composition and cultures led to lower Chinese eth-
nic identity. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 is supported.
Hypotheses 4 and 5 predicted moderation effects of time
and place in the relationship between percentage Chinese
and identity salience/prominence. There was a significant
interaction between percentage Chinese and time in the
United States ( = 0.13, p < .01). There was also a significant
interaction between percentage Chinese and place ( = 0.56,
p < .05). Figures 1 and 2 showed the moderation effects of
time and place, respectively, on the relationship between
identity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese.
As shown in Figure 2, the negative relationship between
identity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese was sig-
nificantly strengthened among residents of SE while only mar-
ginally lowered among residents of NE. These findings have
been confirmed by the slope analysis (Aiken & West, 1991).
For residents in NE, the simple slope for the first-order t was Y

= (-0.1)X + 82.18 (t = 3.08, p < .01). For residents in SE, the
simple slope for the first-order t was Y = (-0.66)X + 133 (t =
-0.98, p < .34). That is, among residents in NE, as the percent-
age Chinese increased in ego networks, the decline of Chinese
identity salience/prominence also declined but at much a
lower rate compared with residents in SE.
For respondents from NE, the average score of Chinese
ethnic identity was 73.88. For respondents from SE, the
average score of Chinese ethnic identity was 78.18.
As Figure 3 illustrates, the negative relationship between
identity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese was sig-
nificantly strengthened among residents who had stayed in the
United States for a short period of time while marginally
reversed among respondents who had stayed in the United
States for a longer period of time.These findings have been con-
firmed by the slope analysis (Aiken & West, 1991). For
respondents with a short stay of 1.16 years in the United States
on average, the simple slope for the first-order t wasY= (-0.52)
X + 116 (t = -0.7, p < .49), and the average score of Chinese
identity salience/prominence was 72.81. For respondents with a
stay of 5.24 years in the United States on average, the simple
slope for the first-order t was Y = (0.01)X + 55.07 (t = 2.82, p <
.01), and the average score of Chinese identity salience/promi-
nence was 55.9. In other words, among newcomers to the
United States, as the percentage Chinese increased in ego net-
works, the decline of Chinese identity salience/prominence
declined, but for old timers in the United States, as the percent-
age Chinese increased in ego networks, the decline of Chinese
identity salience/prominence was reversed.
Discussion
Implications
This study contributes to our understanding of the social con-
texts in which ethnic identity varies in salience/prominence.
The immediate social environment of ego network provides
the arena for the cognitive and affective formation of ethnic
in-group and out-group contrast for a person. However, ego
network is not immune to the larger social context with vari-
ous ethnic compositions in population and different degrees
of culture diversity. A cosmopolitan sociocultural environ-
ment with high degree of diversity in terms of race/ethnicity
and culture is conducive to the maintenance of ethnic iden-
tity when an individual has many co-nationals in his or her
ego network. On the contrary, having many co-nationals in
one's ego network does not stop the decline of ethnic
salience/prominence in an isolated social environment.
Also, as an ethnic group who are recent arrivals in the
United States from a highly homogeneous social context in
mainland China, the heightened sense of ethnic identity
formed at arrival lapses with time as the respondents become
more familiar with the social environment in the United
States. However, keeping a cohort of co-nationals changes
the function of time on Chinese ethnic identity salience.
Among newcomers to the United States, as the percentage
Chinese increases in ego networks, the decline of Chinese
identity salience/prominence declines, but for old timers in
the United States, as the percentage Chinese increases in ego
networks, the decline of Chinese identity salience/promi-
nence is reversed. Ethnic identity seems to require a balance
between host culture and home culture to maintain.
The reason for the function of the percentage Chinese to
vary with time can be the different degree of consciousness
about the differences between their home culture and the host
culture. As the newcomers have limited knowledge of the host
culture in the United States, by keeping many co-nationals in
their social networks, they construct a home culture around
them and thus do not have to confront the differences between
their home culture and the host culture. Without knowledge of
the differences between their home culture and host culture,
their ethnic identity gradually declines in salience. However,

prominence at lower and higher percentage Chinese.

Chinese and higher percentage Chinese.

for old timers, knowledge of the host culture is much more
profound. Thus, when they also have many co-nationals in
their social networks, the differences between their home cul-
ture and host culture maintain sharp in their consciousness as
a result of deepened knowledge of the host culture and famil-
iarity with the home culture. This mindset is conducive to high
ethnic identity salience.
This study highlights the importance of the assumption of
structural symbolic interactionism: the stability of social struc-
ture exemplified in social positions in social networks and cor-
responding identities. In addition, the wisdom of identity
theory that social structure is multi-layered (Merolla, Serpe,
Stryker, & Schultz, 2012) is confirmed by the impact of local-
ity on the interaction of ego networks and identity salience/
prominence. This wisdom is reiterated by scholars in social
network analysis as the ecological perspective of social net-
works (McFarland, Moody, Diehl, Smith, & Thomas, 2014).
Last but not least, the verification model proposed by Burke
and colleagues (Burke & Stets, 2009) seems to be a robust
model as ethnic identity salience/prominence declines when
an individual living in an isolated social environment with
many other co-nationals cannot verify his or her ethnic iden-
tity based on in-group out-group distinction because this per-
son never separates from his or her native culture. Meanwhile,
the fluidity of ethnic identity is highlighted with the significant
impact of time and location on the interaction of identity
salience/prominence and ego networks. Therefore, the vari-
ance of ethnic identity can be described as patterned fluidity.
Limitations of Study
I use identity prominence to measure identity salience. A bet-
ter measure of identity salience needs to replace the current
identity importance measure as identity salience is behavior
oriented while identity importance has various conceptual-
izations. Identity prominence and salience were merged con-
ceptually and empirically in earlier works (Stryker & Serpe,
1994). In addition, a distinction and a causal ordering
between identity prominence and salience have been made,
tested, and supported (Brenner, Serpe, & Stryker, 2014).
However, because ethnic identity is a valued identity, the
results should remain the same using a behavior-oriented
measure given the causal relationship between identity
prominence and salience.
The dependent variable of identity prominence is mea-
sured by one-item question of how important Chinese ethnic
identity is. Although one-item measure of identity promi-
nence was used by scholars researching on identity, multiple-
item measure of identity salience provides better reliability
and has been proposed by Stryker and colleagues (Merolla
et al., 2012). Future studies should use the multi-item mea-
sure of identity salience.
The calculation of the major predictor percentage Chinese is
based on respondents'estimates of the number of total ties and
Chinese ties in their time network. The advantage of calculat-
ing percentage Chinese using estimates is that respondents are
not limited to a certain number of ties. However, because of
cognitive obstacles respondents experience when recalling
people in their time network, such a measure suffers in preci-
sion compared with ties generated through a name generator.
Future research can use name generator for better measure of
percentage Chinese.
Future Researches
Limitations notwithstanding, the article presents some impor-
tant findings and has important implications. The immediate
social environment of ego networks is a significant predictor
of identity salience. The ecological factors of place and time
add complexity to the relationship between ego networks and
identity salience.We must be conscious of the balance between
the stability and fluidity of the Chinese ethnic identity condi-
tioned by various levels of social structure.
This study relates to the gradual growth of the scholarship
on the link between identity and social networks as follows.
First, this research on Chinese ethnic identity and social net-
works is a continuation of the current literature with its empha-
sis on using network measures highlighting the structure of
social networks to predict identity variables. Walker and Lynn
(2013) find that the "embeddedness of RBOs, the breadth of
access that a role-based group has to the rest of an individual's
network" is statistically significant to predict the salience of
religious, student, and work identities (p. 151). McFarland and
Pals (2005) suggest network measures of prominence, homo-
geneity, and bridging are more powerful in predicting identity
change than categories. Stark (2015) proposes that the "triadic
closure" mediates the effect of prejudiced individuals' avoid-
anceoffriendshipswithmembersofminoritygroups.Similarly,
in this study, the measure of proportion of Chinese in a Chinese
graduate student's network is a structural measure of an indi-
vidual's network: these students'access to co-nationals, or their
nonaccess to the host culture in the United States.
Second, this study differs from the current identity theory
literature in the measure of identity salience. Brenner, Serpe,
and Stryker (2014) use a more behavior-oriented definition
for identity salience in recent works and show a causal rela-
tionship between identity salience and identity prominence.
This study uses an importance indicator to measure identity
salience. However, as there is a causal relationship between
identity salience and identity prominence and ethnic identity
is a valued identity similar to other valued identities, it is
highly likely a more behavior-oriented measure of identity
salience as used by Stryker and colleagues would yield simi-
lar results as the one used in this study with regard to the link
between identity salience and social networks.
Third, this study adds to the literature on the link between
identity and social networks by analyzing a social identity:
Chinese ethnic identity. Previous researches investigate how
network structure impacts role identities, which are the focus
of identity theory. This article shows that the salience of
social identities can also be predicted by network measures.
The combination of identity theory and social identity theory

substantiated by social network analysis provides new theo-
retical insight into the identity processes.
That is, researchers can examine other social identities
such as nationality based identities and gender identity with a
nationality or gender homogeneity measure because the eth-
nic homogeneity network measure--proportion of Chinese in
a focal person's network--is effectively used for the analysis
of Chinese ethnic identity in this study. Essentially, category/
group identities are grounded in the contrast between the in-
group and the out-group. Therefore, the proportion of people
with the same category/group membership is a feasible mea-
sure for access to people with the same category/group mem-
bership. This is an addition to the current literature and
explains why the homogeneity measure is not a functional
measure for role identities such as student as found by Walker
and Lynn (2013).

Notes
1. A network revolving around a focal person.
2. I also collected data of people who are emotionally important to
an individual and who discuss important issues with the focal
person. Such network data do not explain ethnic identity, though.
