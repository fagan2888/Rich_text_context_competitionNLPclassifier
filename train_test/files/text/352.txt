Background. Alzheimer's disease has been thought to have familial and sporadic forms, and several genetic defects
have been identified that chiefly explain early-onset familial cases. In this study, our purpose was to detect all cases of
dementia in an established twin registry and to estimate total extent of genetic contribution to liability to Alzheimer's
disease.
Methods. At the first stage, members of the registry were screened for dementia, using in-person or telephone mental
status testing. At the second stage, those who screened positively and their partners were referred for clinical work-ups,
including neuropsychological assessment, physician examination, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging. Clinical diagno-
ses were assigned at a multidisciplinary consensus conference. Probandwise concordance rates were examined by
zygosity, and structural modeling was applied to the data to estimate genetic and environmental influences, using both
single- and multiple-threshold models.
Results. Sixty-five pairs were identified in which one or both was demented. The probandwise concordance rate for
Alzheimer's disease among monozygotic pairs was 67%; the corresponding figure for dizygotic pairs was 22%.
Heritability of liability to Alzheimer's disease was estimated to be .74; to any dementia, .43. The other variance is
attributable to environmental influences.
Conclusions. Findings indicate a substantial genetic effect for these predominantly late-onset Alzheimer's disease
cases. At the same time, structural modeling results and large intra-pair differences in age of onset suggest that
environmental factors are also important in determining whether and when an individual may develop dementia.
DEMENTIA of the Alzheimer's type, resulting in pro-
gressive memory loss and other cognitive and behav-
ioral impairment, represents a major health concern. Disen-
tangling the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is essential to
treatment, prevention, and policy. It is known that genetic
factors are important for Alzheimer's disease, yet molecular
findings suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity.
Families have been investigated in which there is a pattern
of autosomal dominant inheritance with multiple generations
in which affected members have an early age of onset, and
mutations have been identified in three different genes. The
first, with a locus on chromosome 21, relates to encoding (3-
amyloid precursor protein (1). The second, presenilin-1 (PS-
1), has a locus on chromosome 14 (2). The third, with a
locus on chromosome 1, is probably related to encoding
membrane protein (3). These findings are of considerable
interest in suggesting disease mechanisms; however, most
cases of the disorder, which are not early-onset, remain
unexplained by these discoveries.
For late-onset Alzheimer's disease, a polymorphism for
apolipoprotein E (APOE) on chromosome 19 has been found
to affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with the e4 allele
increasing the risk in a dose-dependent manner and the e2
allele apparently decreasing the risk in comparison to the
most common e3 allele (4). However, questions have arisen
concerning the proportion of Alzheimer's disease that can be
explained by APOE and the specificity of APOE with respect
to Alzheimer's disease (5,6). More recently, it has been
reported that homozygosity of the 1-allele in the PS-1 gene
on chromosome 14 is also related to late onset Alzheimer's
disease (7). Thus, although case-control studies have de-
scribed increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in blood rela-
tions (8,9), the relative importance of genetic factors in the
causation of this illness in the general population continues
to be largely unknown (10).
Twin studies can address this question by offering esti-
mates of heritability, that is, the relative importance of
genetic variation for liability to a disease (11). In order to
have an accurate estimate of heritability, it is necessary to
ascertain cases in an unbiased manner from a registry that is
representative of a population. We have superimposed a
dementia study on an ongoing registry-based study of nor-

mal aging, thereby providing a sample that is derived from a
population and is not restricted by age or gender, nor limited
to institutionalized cases or to those who have sought medi-
cal treatment.
METHODS
Sample
The Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins is based on the
Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, or SATSA (12).
SATSA consists of a subset of twins from the population-
based Swedish Twin Registry (13). SATSA includes all 961
pairs from the twin registry who indicated having been
reared apart and a matched sample of 961 pairs who were
reared together, drawn from the twin registry to correspond
in sex, year of birth, and county of birth to the reared-apart
twins (14). Members of the SATSA panel have been sur-
veyed every three years, while a subset of complete pairs
aged 50 and older has participated in in-person cognitive and
health assessments on a three-year rolling schedule.
For purposes of the dementia study, all twins identified for
the SATSA sample were included, whether or not they had
responded to SATSA data collection efforts. Due to very low
prevalence of dementia shown in population surveys among
those under age 55 (15), only pairs born in 1935 or previ-
ously, of whom one or both twin partners was alive in 1987,
were included in the dementia study. The resulting base
sample consisted of 781 pairs plus 416 surviving partners
aged 55 and older (1978 individuals altogether). Across all
individuals, 33.9% were monozygotic (MZ), while 35.0%
of the complete pairs were MZ, figures that correspond to the
registry as a whole. Zygosity was initially determined by
questionnaire and then confirmed serologically. All pairs are
of the same sex.
Screening Procedures
Case ascertainment entailed, first, screening all pairs in
the SATSA sample to establish whether or not the person
should be regarded as a suspected proband for dementia, and
second, conducting a diagnostic assessment of each sus-
pected case. Subjects and collaterals were informed about
the study in accordance with the Ethics Committee of the
Karolinska Institute and the Swedish Data Inspection Board.
Screening took advantage of the level of data available
from SATSA: participation in mailed surveys and in-person
assessment; surveys only; or nonrespondent to surveys.
Figure 1 shows these different pathways. Those who had
requested to be removed from future twin studies (n = 194)
were not screened, leaving a sample of 1,784.
For 638 individuals, in-person cognitive testing results
were available, including the Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion [MMSE; (16)]. The MMSE was modified to include
pairs with one or both alive

recognition questions if recall questions were missed; each
of these three items earned half credit. Therefore, a cutoff
score of 24.5 was used.
Another 466 individuals responded to the most recent
SATSA survey but were not participants in the in-person
testing. Individuals who returned the survey were regarded
as intact unless identified through one of two secondary
methods: registry linkage (described below) or a family
member's contacting us by telephone or by letter to indicate
that this member of the SATSA sample was having cognitive
difficulty. Altogether, 48 individuals were identified through
reports of family members.
For the remaining SATSA survey nonresponders, screen-
ing was by means of a telephone interview [TELE; (17)].
Telephone numbers were obtained by submitting the names
to a national listing of telephone numbers. Before they could
be screened, 89 of the survey nonresponders had died.
Another 86 were unable to be reached, because they had
emigrated or had unlisted telephone numbers or were not
locatable through the telephone listing or never answered.
Of the 457 who were reached, 317 agreed to an interview
and 140 refused. Altogether, evaluation with either the
MMSE or TELE was achieved with 80.9% of those slated
for screening and still alive.
The telephone interview incorporated the Mental Status
Questionnaire [MSQ; (18)]; items to tap other cognitive
domains, i.e., attention and working memory, short-term
memory, and cognitive abstraction; and questions about
health and functional status, self-reported memory function-
ing, and depression. A proxy form of the interview focused
on functional status, memory functioning, and depression,
including history and course of any cognitive or memory
problems.
Finally, registry linkage was employed in which all mem-
bers of the SATSA sample were matched with the Swedish
Psychiatric In-patient Registry in order to identify any mem-
ber of the SATSA sample with any diagnosis of dementia.
Registry linkage offers the advantage that all individuals are
screened regardless of their participation status in SATSA.
However, in part because records were available only for
1972-1983, this method of screening was essentially inef-
fectual, resulting in only 4 matches.
Evaluations of Screening Methodology
Two issues were of concern. First, we wished to identify
all potential cases and to avoid false negatives. Second, we
wished to avoid any bias in screening with respect to zygos-
ity. Therefore, we undertook several ancillary analyses to
evaluate the screening methodology.
The assumption that those able to answer the survey
completely without assistance were nondemented was tested
through applying the telephone protocol to a sample of
survey responders. A sample of 70 was identified, of whom
one refused and 69 were interviewed. None was determined
to be demented.
The sensitivity and specificity of the telephone interview
were tested on an established registry of 41 Alzheimer's
disease patients and controls. In this selected sample, re-
sponse rate was 90%, sensitivity was 100%, and specificity
was 91% (17).
In completed diagnostic workups with suspected probands
in the present study, the false positive rate was 33.6%. Thus,
there is considerable loss of specificity in an unselected
population. Of 32 partners who screened negative, 31 were
not demented and one was a false negative. Apart from
partners, we have no basis on which to estimate a false
negative rate. However, our design has built into it the
feature that everyone is rescreened at 3-year intervals. We
now have six examples of cases who were negative at
screening but subsequently found to be demented. None had
an age of onset earlier than the screening, confirming that the
screening result was correct.
Thus, with multiple ways of entering the study, we en-
hanced our chances of including all cases of dementia.
Particularly notable is that considerable effort was put into
screening those who were nonresponders in the longitudinal
panel, and that over 40% of those who screened positive
came from this group. To the extent that under-
ascertainment did occur, there is no reason to believe that it
was biased. At all stages, personnel collecting data were
blind to zygosity. Nearly the same proportions of MZ and
dizygotic (DZ) twins were screened by each method. Among
those who screened positive, 34.1% were monozygotic,
matching the distribution of zygosity in the base population.
Determination of Diagnoses
The diagnostic evaluation employed a nurse, psycholo-
gist, and physician trained in geriatric medicine. The proto-
col parallels Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzhei-
mer's Disease (CERAD) procedures for physical and
neurological evaluations, laboratory tests, neuropsychologi-
cal testing, and neuroimaging (19). Evaluation was discon-
tinued and the suspected proband excluded if it was learned
during the evaluation that the individual was not demented
but instead had some other condition, such as psychiatric
disorder or mental retardation.
After workups were complete, findings were presented at
a consensus diagnosis conference, where the chair (BJ) was
blind to zygosity and to any information other than that
presented at the conference. Each professional presented her
or his independent opinion, and the final diagnosis was
reached through discussion. Diagnostic decisions were
guided by checklists that correspond to DSM-III-R criteria
for dementia (20) and for level (severity) of dementia,
NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable and possible Alzhei-
mer's disease (21), and -- once available -- NINDS-
AIREN criteria for vascular dementia (22).
Twin partners of probands were given an identical clinical
workup. While probands were all alive at the time of screen-
ing, partners were brought into the study regardless of their
status in 1987. Among co-twins of probands, 53% of MZ
and 55% of DZ were still living. If the partners were
deceased and therefore had not been screened, their diagnos-
tic assessment included informant interviews (23) and re-
view of medical records, including death certificates. Analy-
ses were subsequently conducted in two ways, both
including all pairs and excluding pairs where the partner died
prior to the age of onset of the proband (i.e., "truncated
pairs").
Mean age at workup was 78.4 years (SD = 7.9) for MZ
M120 GATZETAL.
and 77.5 years (SD = 7.8) for DZ twins. Age of onset was
established by asking the informant for a description of
memory and other problems, followed by the age at which
these changes were observed (24). Where medical records
were available, they were used to crosscheck the information.
Cases and partners are being followed longitudinally
every 18 months, with post-mortem neuropathological ex-
amination for any who die. Diagnoses used in the analyses
reported here reflect longitudinal clarification but not new
cases of dementia. One case that had been classified as
"other dementia" met criteria for possible Alzheimer's
disease longitudinally; two cases that had been called Alz-
heimer's disease were changed to reflect other dementia (in
one instance, mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia; in
the other, dementia of ambiguous etiology).
Autopsy confirmation of diagnosis is available for 10
cases. There was concurrence on 9 cases between clinical
diagnosis and neuropathological results (5 of these were
Alzheimer's disease cases). On the tenth, from a DZ pair,
clinical diagnosis was vascular dementia, whereas neuropa-
thology supported a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
A total of 75 probands were identified: 38 probable Alz-
heimer's disease, 11 possible Alzheimer's disease, 12 vas-
cular dementia, and 14 mixed or other dementia diagnoses.
Among partners not primarily ascertained were 5 probable
Alzheimer's disease, 2 possible, 1 vascular dementia, and 4
with other dementia diagnoses. Sixty-five pairs were avail-
able for twin analyses, reflecting the fact that 7 pairs (3 MZ
and 4 DZ) had been doubly ascertained; that is, both mem-
bers of the pair screened positive and were diagnosed as
demented; and 3 partners refused to participate in the assess-
ment, losing those 3 pairs to analysis.
There was no significant difference by zygosity in age of
onset. Among MZ pairs, mean age of onset for all Alzhei-
mer's disease cases was 75.8 years (SD = 9.03, range 60-
91 years). Among DZ pairs, mean age of onset was 73.7
years (SD = 8.92, range 47-90 years).
Prevalence Estimates
The prevalence rate of dementia for those in the sample
aged 65 and older and alive in 1987 was 4.9%, and the rate
of Alzheimer's disease was 3.3%. These calculations are
based on a weighted combination of sample prevalences
across subgroups defined by screening outcome, but without
including any false negatives. These rates compare well to
recent reports of prevalence of dementia and of Alzheimer's
disease (15). Rates of dementia did hot differ significantly by
zygosity; and, among dementia cases, 31.0% were MZ,
matching the MZ:DZ ratio in the base population. Rates of
dementia also did not differ significantly according to rear-
ing status. An identical number of twins reared together and
twins reared apart were given clinical workups. Of all
dementia cases, 54.0% were twins reared apart, while
46.0% were twins reared together (for Alzheimer's disease
alone, 47.4% of cases were twins reared apart, while 52.6%
were twins reared together).
Concordance Rates
The first step in twin analyses is computation of concor-
dance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Concor-
dance rates -- a usual means of reporting results from twin
studies of psychopathology -- make use of the fact that MZ
twin pairs are genetically identical whereas DZ twins share
on average only half of their segregating genes. Probandwise
concordance rates represent the ratio of the number of
affected twin partners of independently ascertained probands
to the total number of probands. If MZ twin pairs have a
higher concordance rate than DZ twin pairs, the importance
of genetic effects is indicated. For calculating probandwise
concordance for Alzheimer's disease, probands with
definite, probable, or possible Alzheimer's disease were
included. Pairs were regarded as concordant if the partner
had Alzheimer's disease or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular
pathology or unspecified dementia. Pairs where the partner
had vascular dementia or a dementia due to another specified
cause (e.g., hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease) were ex-
cluded. Results shown in Table 1 indicate significantly
greater probandwise concordance for Alzheimer's disease
for MZ than for DZ pairs. (For all pairs, difference between
concordance rates = 44.8, 95% CI = .001, 80.8).
There were insufficient probands in any other diagnostic
group for calculating separate concordance rates. However,
there were no pairs concordant for vascular dementia. Con-
cordance rates were then calculated for all dementias. Dif-
ference in concordance between MZ and DZ pairs was
substantial but not statistically significant. The fact that the
concordance rate for DZ pairs for all dementias was some-
what higher than for Alzheimer's disease alone was due to
three DZ pairs in which the proband had Alzheimer's dis-
ease, while the partner had another dementia; there was only
one such MZ pair.
Tetrachoric Correlations
Also shown in Table 1 are tetrachoric correlations, with
95% confidence intervals, for Alzheimer's disease and for
all dementias. Tetrachoric correlations, representing the
correlation of liability between relatives, are calculated us-
ing PRELIS (25). The values are analogous to intraclass
correlations based on continuous data. All pairs are used in
which both members of the pair could be given a value of 1
(demented) or 0 (not demented). The 0 values were assigned
to any individual who was determined not to be demented
after clinical workup and to any individual whose screening
outcome was negative. In these contingency tables, each
pair is entered only once, even if doubly ascertained.
Results indicate a very high degree of twin similarity. MZ
pairs are more similar than DZ pairs, pointing to substantial
heritability. At the same time, MZ pairs appear to be less
than twice as similar as DZ pairs. Therefore, not all of the
similarity between pairs can be explained by genetic in-
fluences.
Tetrachoric correlations were also calculated for twins
reared together and twins reared apart. Results for Alzhei-
mer's disease were .76 and .70, respectively. As these are
not significantly different from one another, rearing status
was not considered further.

Threshold Models
Recent analytical advances in twin methodology use struc-
tural model-fitting techniques in order to estimate genetic and
environmental components of variance (26). These methods
are based on liability-threshold models, which assume a
latent, normally distributed liability to disease that is manifest
as a categorical phenotype, i.e., demented or not demented
(27). For dichotomous or ordinal data, models are fit to
contingency tables for MZ and for DZ twins using the Mx
program (28). A threshold is fixed at a z-score corresponding
to prevalence of dementia in the sample. Heritability (h2) is an
estimate of the relative importance of additive genetic differ-
ences for the variance in a population. Shared environment
(c2) reflects experiences that contribute to twin similarity,
e.g., living in a rural area. Non-shared environment (e2)
refers to the contribution of environmental experiences not
shared by twin pairs, e.g., different work histories. Expecta-
tions for fitting the observed data are based on the fact that
genetic similarity is half as great for DZ as for MZ twin pairs,
while shared environmental influences contribute equally to
making MZ and DZ pairs similar. A series of models was
tested, with all three parameters included in the full model,
and then successively dropping either the h2 or the c2 parame-
ter. Degrees of freedom reflect the number of parameters
being estimated, the number of constraints, and the number
of observed statistics. Indicators of fit include chi square and
Akaike's Information Criterion [AIC; (29)]. A significant
increase in the chi square goodness-of-fit between the full and
reduced model indicates that the reduced model fits the data
less well than the full model. Final determination of which
model to accept is based on a combination of statistical
indicators, parsimony, genetic logic, and consistency with
inferences based on the correlations and concordances.
Models were fit for Alzheimer's disease and for all de-
mentias. In addition, for all dementias, a multiple-threshold
model was used with three levels: demented, mild cognitive
impairment (insufficient for diagnosis as demented), and not
demented. A multiple-threshold model is based on the as-
sumption that the same underlying liability is reflected in
dementia and in mild cognitive dysfunction. Power analyses
have shown that low population prevalence diseases (i.e., a
high threshold) require inordinately large sample sizes to
have sufficient power for identifying accurate estimates for
the components of variance (30). Multiple-threshold models
generally afford some improved power. Still, because of the
small sample sizes in the present study, standard errors are
quite large.
Resulting parameter estimates from a series of models are
shown in Table 2. The second and third models are each
nested in the full model but not in each other. The full model
appears to offer the best solution. Models that drop the
additive genetic parameter have a poorer fit, meaning that
this parameter must be retained. While h2 and c2 are difficult
to distinguish in these models, the pattern of correlations
argues for retaining the shared environmental parameter.
The multiple-threshold model gave a reasonable fit to the
data, suggesting that there may be a shared liability underly-
ing dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and that these
represent a continuum of dysfunction. To date, just 10% of
the mildly impaired individuals have gone on to develop
dementia when followed up longitudinally.
Table 2 shows only the models with thresholds corres-
ponding to the contingency tables underlying Table 1. How-
ever, a family of models was tested using both lower and
higher thresholds. Higher prevalences represent the possibil-
ity of undetected false negatives. Very similar parameter
estimates resulted from this exercise. Only under the ex-
treme assumption of doubling the prevalences in Table 2,
denoting that the contingency tables contain only half of the
cases and that there was an equal number of false negatives
who were undetected, is there a noticeable effect on the
parameters. For example, h2 for Alzheimer's disease would
become .62; c2, .35; e2, .02. However, this model fit quite
poorly, x2 = 23.06 (df = 4, p < .0001). The fact that c2 is
increased under this latter assumption is consistent with prior
demonstration that, if the disorder increases probability of
enrollment, then c2 will be overestimated and e2 will be
underestimated (31).

Within-pair Differences in Age of Onset
Figure 2 shows all pairs used in the Alzheimer's disease
analyses with their ages of onset. As evident in the figure,
age of onset can vary widely between members of a concor-
dant pair. For concordant pairs, the within-pair difference in
age of onset for Alzheimer's disease ranged from 4 to 16 for
MZs and from 1 to 12 for DZs. The means were 9.5 (SD =
5.87) for MZ and 5.6 (SD = 3.50) for DZ, a difference that
was not statistically significant. In other words, only 56% of
MZ and 50% of DZ cases were concordant within 5 years
from the age when the first member of the pair became
demented.
DISCUSSION
Concordance rates, intra-pair tetrachoric correlations, and
model-fitting results with this registry-derived population-
based sample of twins suggest that there is a marked herita-
ble component to dementia of the Alzheimer's type late in
life. Concordance figures are based on ascertained pairs,
while correlations and model-fitting take the population into
account. In particular, results from model-fitting allow
quantification of the relative importance of genetic risk
factors in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. It bears emphasis
that these variance estimates are "anonymous." Thus, twin
studies tell us how much influence genes have, taken alto-
gether, but do not identify specific genes of importance.
One manner in which multiple hereditary factors may play
a role in Alzheimer's disease occurrence is suggested by a
model of dementia that incorporates a neuropathological
threshold (32). Attaining that threshold is a function both of
extent of cerebral reserve and onset of specific pathophysio-
logical events. Genes may contribute either to the specific
pathophysiological defect or to extent of cerebral reserve.
At the same time, we would not want to overemphasize a
solely genetic model. Two findings point to the role of the
environment. First, both the tetrachoric correlations and the
structural modeling results point to twin similarity due to the
environment (c2). These variance estimates are, again,
"anonymous." The Alzheimer's disease literature details a
number of risk and protective factors (33), but the analyses
presented here do not incorporate specific exposures. Inter-
preting the fact that environmental factors emerged as shared
influences rather than as nonshared influences (e2) does not
mean that both members of the pair suffered from exposure
to the same risk factor; rather, that both members of the pair
shared a likelihood to be exposed to some factor that in-
fluenced their risk to develop dementia.
Second, the range of ages of onset within both MZ and DZ
pairs is further evidence for environmental influences. Espe-
cially for identical pairs with discrepant ages of onset, the
possible role of environmental factors is compelling. These
results might even suggest a hypothesis that there are differ-
ent etiologies for liability to the disease and for age of onset.
It is of interest to compare these findings from the Study of
Dementia in Swedish Twins with other twin studies of
Alzheimer's disease. The Norwegian Twin Registry has
been matched with records from geriatric services in old age
homes, leading to the report of 83% concordance for 12 MZ
pairs and 42% concordance for 24 DZ pairs (34). Probably
due to case identification strategies, the Norwegian sample is
somewhat older than ours. As has been pointed out (35),
concordance rates can increase with the age of the sample.
Further, this method of identifying cases would lead to high
specificity but low sensitivity. In particular, cases may have
been missed because they never came to the attention of
these service sites. The National Academy of Sciences
Registry of Aging Twin Veterans (comprising males born
1917 to 1927) has been screened with methods analogous to
ours, with probandwise concordance rates of 21 % for 19 MZ
pairs and 11% for 18 DZ pairs (36). However, the preva-

CONCORDANT DISCORDANT
Twin Pairs
Figure 2. Probands with Alzheimer's disease and their partners, shown
separately for (A) monozygotic and (B) dizygotic pairs. Each set of two bars
represents a twin pair. Age of onset is indicated by the transition from white
to dark bars. Total height of bar indicates age at most recent assessment or at
death.
lence of Alzheimer's disease in this relatively young sample
is presently 0.42%. Over time, given the intrapair differ-
ences in age of onset that we have observed, it might be
expected that more pairs will become concordant. The Finn-
ish Twin Registry has been linked with hospital discharge
records. Probandwise concordance for Alzheimer's disease
was 31% in 35 MZ pairs and 9% in 30 DZ pairs, with mean
age of onset 77 years in MZ twins and 73 in DZ twins (37).
There may well have been under-ascertainment due to in-
cluding only those cases who had a hospital discharge
record. Age-adjusted incidence is reported to be 0.7%. This
number corresponds to the 5-year Kaplan-Meier incidence
rates for total dementia in a population at ages 65 to 69 (38),
but incidence has been found to double at successive 5-year
age groups; thus, incidence should be much greater for a
sample followed until death. In the Finnish data, rate of
Alzheimer's disease was also higher in MZ than in DZ pairs,
which could reflect ascertainment bias.
Prior to these studies, a volunteer National Institutes of
Health sample of 22 twin pairs showed a concordance rate of
41 % for MZ and 40% for DZ (39). Mean age at workup was
70. Although the sample was relatively large compared to
case studies of single individuals, the likelihood of volunteer
bias makes interpretation difficult. The earliest twin study
was that of Kallman (40), who reported 42.8% concordance
for MZ and 8.0% concordance for DZ co-twins with respect
to senile psychosis. This diagnosis excluded presenile cases
(at that time, the term "Alzheimer's disease" was reserved
for presenile dementia) and combined what would now be
regarded as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementias, and
other more rare late-onset dementias. Thus, the Kallman
results can most appropriately be compared to all dementias.
Interestingly, he held that the best model for understanding
heritability of dementia might be to consider separate genes
for longevity and for the psychopathological changes associ-
ated with senile psychosis. Finally, there have been reports
in the literature of single MZ pairs that have remained
discordant for over 15 years (41,42).
There are major challenges in evaluating heritability for
late-age-of-onset, low-prevalence disorders at a single pe-
riod of time. Failure to detect all cases is one major concern.
Available resources precluded our undertaking either in-
person or telephone assessment with every individual in the
population, and we cannot be certain of the sensitivity of the
case ascertainment procedure. However, convergence be-
tween the prevalence of dementia in this sample and that
reported by various population-based surveys provides some
assurance that the method of identifying cases was success-
ful. The chief methodological concern, above all, is whether
undetected cases differ from detected cases in any fashion
that would influence concordance. We did not find any bias
in this regard. Further reassurance stems from comparison of
the dizygotic concordance figure to the rate of cases among
siblings of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, who also
on average share half of their genes. A re-analysis of 7 case-
control studies has shown that 18.5% of siblings of late-
onset cases of Alzheimer's disease had a diagnosis of de-
mentia (43). This rate is not substantially different from the
concordance rate found here for DZ twin pairs.
Because Alzheimer's disease has a late age of expression,
many presumably predisposed partners will have died of
other causes before the proband becomes affected, poten-
tially biasing the estimate of heritability. For this reason, we
considered the data in two ways, both including and exclud-
ing pairs where the partner died before the proband's age of
onset. When these pairs were excluded, the estimate for
genetic variance decreased and the estimate for shared envi-
ronmental variance increased. This result may well simply
reflect twin similarity for survival, because pairs who are
discordant for age at death are eliminated from the sample.
Another concern is diagnosis, and the difficulty in accu-
rately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We may have been
either too inclusive or too exclusive with respect to Alzhei-
mer's disease diagnoses. Consequently, we have presented
results based on diagnosed Alzheimer's disease but also for
total dementia. At the same time, neuropathological con-
firmation indicates that the diagnoses are largely accurate.
Other concerns include refusals on the part of co-twin
partners to participate and the fact that the study is cross-
sectional. These methodological considerations all would
mainly lead to an underestimation of heritability. For exam-
M124 GATZETAL.
pie, if all pairs are followed longitudinally, some partners,
although currently intact, may develop dementia.
Although ours is a large twin study of dementia, because
Alzheimer's disease is a low-prevalence disorder, sample
size is small with respect to statistical power, and confidence
intervals are large. Numbers of cases become particularly
small when pairs are dropped from Alzheimer's disease
analyses due to the partner's presenting with another de-
menting disorder or to the partner's death before the pro-
band's age of onset. It should be cautioned too that shared
environment will be overestimated if a disorder is age-
related, because twin pairs share the same age. However, a
larger sample would be required in order to determine the
contribution of age to the c2 term. Further, gene-
environment correlation and gene-environment interaction
are not evaluated. Finally, it should be noted that heritability
estimates, because they are anonymous, may include both
genetic influences specific to Alzheimer's disease and ge-
netic influences related to cerebral reserve. Nonetheless,
across the various analyses, results consistently indicated
significant heritability.
In conclusion, our findings indicate a substantial genetic
susceptibility in late-onset Alzheimer's disease cases,
reflecting multiple defects or variations in brain metabolism
that may ultimately lead to a similar pathological cascade. At
the same time, it appears that environmental factors play a
key role with respect to both occurrence and age of onset,
either through their effects on cerebral reserve or through
modifying the disease cascade, an observation with implica-
tions for strategies to delay onset or to prevent disorder
entirely.
