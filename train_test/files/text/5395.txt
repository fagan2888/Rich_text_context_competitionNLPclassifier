Abstract
Background/aims: During the 2014­2016 West African Ebola epidemic, clinical trials were fast-tracked in order to
identify prophylactic vaccines and experimental treatments that might be useful in preventing or treating Ebola. These
trials included the ongoing EBOVAC-Salone study, which was established and implemented in Sierra Leone to assess the
safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen.
Methods: This article describes the experiences of the EBOVAC-Salone research team in setting up and implementing
the trial, and provides recommendations for research teams aiming to conduct clinical trials in future outbreak situations.
Results: Establishing a clinical trial during an outbreak brought some unique challenges, including those related to trial
design and the regulatory environment, operational issues, and community engagement. The situation was further com-
plicated by the weak infrastructure and limited experience of clinical trials in Sierra Leone. However, operating in an out-
break context also brought some benefits to the research team, including strong stakeholder support. The EBOVAC-
Salone study recruited participants both during and after the outbreak, leading to additional challenges to trial implemen-
tation during the post-outbreak transition.
Conclusion: Many lessons have been learned about setting up and implementing a clinical trial during a devastating
Ebola epidemic, and some of the experiences of the EBOVAC-Salone team were mirrored by those of other researchers
operating in the region. Common to several of these research groups is a recommendation that research should be
more closely incorporated into outbreak response planning, which could expedite the establishment of timely and
appropriate research projects. We recommend that the lessons learned by researchers during the West African Ebola
epidemic are built into programmes and strategies to improve the responses to future epidemics, wherever they occur.

Background
The scale of the 2014­2016 West African Ebola out-
break was unprecedented. Over 28,000 people were
infected across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone,
11,300 of whom died.1 As part of the global response,
clinical trials of experimental treatments and prophy-
lactic vaccines were fast-tracked for testing.
In December 2014, the Innovative Medicines
Initiative awarded funding from the Ebola + pro-
gramme to the EBOVAC1 consortium of research insti-
tutions in partnership with the Janssen Pharmaceutical
Companies of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) to
support the development and evaluation of a prime-
boost prophylactic Ebola vaccine regimen.2,3 The
EBOVAC-Salone study in Sierra Leone, which is still
ongoing, is part of the EBOVAC1 project.

The EBOVAC-Salone study is assessing the safety
and immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-
Filo prime-boost regimen in a population affected by
Ebola and is being carried out in Kambia District in
northern Sierra Leone. It is coordinated by the London
School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in collabora-
tion with the College of Medicine and Allied Health
Sciences in Sierra Leone, and is sponsored by Janssen.
The Innovative Medicines Initiative is also funding the
related Ebola Vaccine Deployment, Acceptance and
Compliance consortium which supports communica-
tions, community engagement and enabling technolo-
gies for the EBOVAC-Salone trial.4
Collaborations for the EBOVAC-Salone study were
established quickly between November 2014 and
March 2015 in an emergency context in which the
Ebola epidemic was still claiming lives across Sierra
Leone. Vaccination of adult trial participants began on
9 October 2015. The study is ongoing and has recruited
and vaccinated participants both before and after the
end of the Ebola epidemic, declared by the World
Health Organization on 7 November 2015.
This article offers observations on some of the chal-
lenges encountered and lessons learned while setting up
and recruiting participants into a clinical trial during
and after an epidemic, and makes recommendations on
how these could be addressed in the future should a
similar public health emergency arise. Several research
groups have published their own experiences of con-
ducting clinical trials during the Ebola outbreak, and
the literature paints a picture of the context within
which the EBOVAC-Salone trial was established. A
number of researchers have described the difficulty of
designing a robust yet ethical trial during an outbreak5,6
and then having to amend or abandon their original
study objectives as the epidemic waned.5,7 Others high-
lighted the limitations imposed by the infrastructure of
the country in which they were operating.5 The chal-
lenges were not just for researchers: the burden on local
ethics committees, dealing with huge increases in work-
load, was also noted.7­9
While many of the challenges and lessons described
in this article have been shared by other researchers,
this article makes a novel contribution to the literature
as one of the few trials to enrol participants both dur-
ing and after the epidemic. This gives the authors an
additional perspective into issues such as community
engagement, participant recruitment and trial design,
all of which were affected by the end of the outbreak.
Methods and results
Trial design
The design of the EBOVAC-Salone study was revised
on several occasions in response to the evolution of the
Ebola epidemic. During the epidemic's peak in 2014, an
80,000-person, individually randomised, controlled trial
was considered briefly that aimed to determine the effi-
cacy of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo regimen com-
pared to a control vaccine. However, administration of
a placebo during a viral outbreak with such a high case-
fatality rate had never been done before, and the ethics
of this were hotly debated.10
Alternative trial designs were considered, including a
cluster-randomised trial and a stepped-wedge design.11
In January 2015, taking into account ethical concerns,
the epidemic circumstances, field conditions, and statis-
tical considerations, the trial was redesigned as a large
cluster-randomised trial of approximately 800,000 par-
ticipants to be randomised to receiving either immedi-
ate or delayed vaccination. Regulatory authorities in
Sierra Leone requested a staged approach to recruit-
ment to first determine the safety of the vaccine, with
initial enrolment of 40 adults who were to be offered
immediate vaccination (Stage 1), followed by enrolment
of 400 adults (Stage 2) before commencing the main
cluster-randomised trial.11
Site visits and mathematical modelling were used to
help determine both the sample size and geographical
location of the study. By the first quarter of 2015, the
epidemic was slowing and it was important to determine
whether there would be a sufficient number of cases to
determine vaccine efficacy. Kambia District in northern
Sierra Leone was chosen as the site for the study because
no other prophylactic vaccine trial was underway in that
part of the country and because modelling data pre-
dicted a 50% probability of the epidemic being over in
Kambia District by October 2015, compared to a 75%
likelihood in Port Loko and Western Area, the other
districts under consideration, by August 2015.
However, the epidemic declined at a faster rate than
expected during the first quarter of 2015 throughout
Sierra Leone. By May 2015, it was clear that the study
would be unable to determine vaccine efficacy. The
cluster-randomised trial protocol was therefore aban-
doned before it was approved by the regulatory author-
ities, and the primary objective for the study was
changed to determination of the safety and immuno-
genicity of the regimen,11 with an estimated sample size
of approximately 3500 participants. Stage 1 was kept as
open label vaccination of 40 healthy adult participants.
In December 2015, following the end of the outbreak,
the use of placebo was reintroduced to the study design.
Stage 2 was formally amended to a double-blind rando-
mised controlled trial assessing the safety and immuno-
genicity of the vaccine regimen, with follow-up for
12 months and a sample size of approximately 730 par-
ticipants. Enrolment of 400 adults (randomised in a 3:1
ratio of Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo to MENVEOÒ)
has been followed by an age de-escalation component
for paediatric participants.
The changes to the trial design affected many
aspects of the study beyond what is typically
Mooney et al. 437
encountered in the setup phase of a trial. As the trial
design evolved, budgets underwent multiple revisions,
and project plans changed significantly while the team
waited for approvals, with associated amendments to
orders and procurement of equipment and consum-
ables. The expectations of stakeholders and community
members had to be managed as the study enrolment
target was significantly reduced which shrank the
study's geographical footprint from an initial district-
wide catchment area, to just the inhabitants of two of
the district's main towns.
Partnerships
The time pressures of operating during an outbreak
influenced how partnerships in Sierra Leone were
established, and the study was implemented by organi-
sations which had not previously worked together.
Partners in-country were needed quickly to provide
local leadership and expertise, and to implement field
activities for the trial. After discussions with Sierra
Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation and other
stakeholders, a research partnership was established
with the University of Sierra Leone's College of
Medicine and Allied Health Sciences. However,
College of Medicine staff had limited experience of clin-
ical trials and therefore significant technical support
was required from the London School of Hygiene &
Tropical Medicine and the trial sponsor.
Two non-governmental organisations also worked
on the trial. Goal joined as the trial's logistics partner,
while World Vision were engaged to provide commu-
nity engagement and IT support, amongst other activi-
ties. Clinical research is outside of the usual remit of
these organisations, and therefore it was essential that
all partners understood others' requirements and lim-
itations from the beginning of the project.
Regulatory and ethics reviews
EBOVAC-Salone study approvals were required from
the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine
Ethics Committee, the Sierra Leone Ethical and
Scientific Review Committee, and the Pharmacy Board
of Sierra Leone the national regulatory authority.
During the Ebola epidemic, the African Vaccine
Regulatory Forum, with support from the World
Health Organization, established a platform for con-
ducting joint reviews of clinical trial applications with
input from international regulatory agencies. This
aimed to achieve rapid comprehensive reviews of clini-
cal trials in the context of potentially limited regulatory
and ethics review capacity in the sub-Saharan African
countries participating in Ebola vaccine trials.12 The
EBOVAC-Salone study team engaged with the African
Vaccine Regulatory Forum review process at a meeting
in April 2015 that was also attended by the Pharmacy
Board of Sierra Leone and the Sierra Leonean ethics
committee.
During the epidemic, the ethics committees and the
Pharmacy Board implemented an expedited review pro-
cess for Ebola-related studies. Both Sierra Leonean
authorities experienced a dramatic rise in workload in
2014­2015 as they were receiving frequent submissions
for Ebola-related research. Despite this, the authorities
continued to give thorough reviews and completed
most reviews within 1 month following submission.
The sponsor and study team engaged the authorities
from the start of the project, to prepare them for the
possibility of study design changes in response to the
evolving epidemic.
Ethical considerations
Shortly after the Ebola epidemic was declared a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern, the World
Health Organization established a panel of experts to
discuss ethical questions relating to the use of unproven
interventions, with discussions held around appropriate
trial designs during an outbreak.13 Both the World
Health Organization's ethics panel and a group of
expert anthropologists issued guidance to research
groups planning to conduct clinical trials during the
epidemic.14
An overarching ethical concern was that clinical
research should not impact on the health system or the
emergency response. The World Health Organization
coordinated prioritisation of the most promising
research, so as not to overburden the health systems in
the affected countries.15 In Sierra Leone, planning for
the EBOVAC-Salone study was undertaken in partner-
ship with the College of Medicine and Allied Health
Sciences, and a criterion was set that healthcare work-
ers involved in the emergency response would not be
recruited to the study team. Senior staff were therefore
recruited from overseas to provide technical support,
while also building the experience of more junior
national staff who had not previously been involved in
clinical research.
The question of whether trials should be placebo-
controlled was particularly contentious,16­19 although
not a new debate.19 During initial discussions held in
Sierra Leone in early 2015 by the EBOVAC-Salone
team, the country's authorities did not favour a rando-
mised placebo-controlled trial, and this ethical concern
informed the study design as discussed above. In com-
mon with some other Ebola vaccine trials taking place
in the region, the research team therefore developed an
innovative trial design to study efficacy without the use
of a placebo. This trial design was never implemented,
because the epidemic's decline made it impossible to
establish vaccine efficacy before this study could be
initiated.
438 Clinical Trials 15(5)
Further ethical issues became apparent once the
study began. EBOVAC-Salone social science research
indicated that one of the motivating factors for partici-
pation in the trial was an expectation that the vaccine
would be effective. The research team addressed this by
placing additional emphasis on the investigational
nature of the vaccine during community outreach activ-
ities and the informed consent process. The latter
included a test which participants had to pass before
being enrolled to demonstrate their understanding of
the trial.
Initial participant recruitment took place prior to the
end of the epidemic, and demand to participate in the
study at that time was greater than the number of parti-
cipants needed. To ensure fair subject selection, a lot-
tery system was devised, whereby households were
selected and prioritised in an open ballot.20 An age de-
escalation approach was adopted with safety data being
reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee
prior to the enrolment of each cohort of children.
Pregnant women were excluded because of concerns
over the safety of viral vaccines given during pregnancy.
This exclusion criterion was common to all Ebola vac-
cine trials in the region, although some authors have
argued that, in future, pregnant women should not be
denied the potential benefits of participating in clinical
research in an outbreak of such high mortality.21
Communications and engagement
The normal processes of engaging with communities
prior to a trial of a new investigational medical product
were given an additional layer of complexity by the
Ebola outbreak. The challenges of community engage-
ment and building trust and awareness in a setting with
no experience of clinical trials, such as Kambia, were
exacerbated by the urgency to commence the research.
Formative, qualitative research into community
dynamics and perceptions around Ebola and the clini-
cal trial were especially important during a period that
was characterised by a lack of trust in both national
and international organisations.22 This research, and
ongoing tracking of rumours and concerns, helped tar-
get engagement approaches and community messaging.
For example, a rumour that the vaccine trial was bring-
ing Ebola back to the community, nicknamed `Ebola
Phase Two', was identified by the social scientists. The
community liaison team responded by visiting the mar-
ket where the rumour had originated and initiating
meetings to address the concerns with the support of
pre-briefed local stakeholders.
Establishing the study while the emergency response
infrastructure was in place was challenging for the
study's community engagement in some ways, but
facilitated it in others. The Ebola response centres
brought stakeholders together, providing an efficient
mechanism through which these individuals could be
briefed. Because many stakeholders were already
engaged in the fight against Ebola, they were often par-
ticularly receptive to research teams.
However, in an environment where people were des-
perate for solutions, the study's community engage-
ment had to clearly differentiate the research project
from the Ebola response to avoid possible misinterpre-
tations that the trial was delivering a licenced vaccine
as part of the humanitarian response.
Participant recruitment
During the outbreak, community interest in participat-
ing in the first stage of the study was high. EBOVAC's
social science research indicated a range of motivating
factors behind participation in the early stages of the
trial, including the notion of `sacrifice' or duty as a citi-
zen; and hope or belief in the power of the vaccine to
prevent Ebola.
Contrary to the experience of some groups conduct-
ing research during the outbreak, generous financial
compensation was not necessary to stimulate participa-
tion in the trial in Kambia.8 Study partners sought
advice from the national ethics committee before agree-
ing to rates that would fairly recompense a participant's
time and transport without providing undue induce-
ment, based on estimated lost earnings and transport
costs to and from the clinic.
Human resources
The limited pool of clinicians in Sierra Leone was
severely affected by the outbreak as Ebola-related mor-
tality among health workers was particularly high.23
Prior to the epidemic, Sierra Leone ranked fifth from
bottom among 193 countries in terms of numbers of
physicians per head of population.24 As discussed
above, so as not to further weaken the wider health sys-
tem, the research team committed not to recruit any
healthcare workers employed in the government health
system or involved in the Ebola response without the
approval of the appropriate authorities.
Because limited clinical research had been conducted
in Sierra Leone prior to the Ebola epidemic, there were
very few individuals in the country with appropriate
research experience, and those that had this were gener-
ally involved in other Ebola-related studies. Technical
and scientific support was therefore provided to the in-
country team, facilitated by the London School of
Hygiene & Tropical Medicine's response to the epi-
demic that allowed staff to temporarily leave their cur-
rent post to work on the Ebola response.
It proved challenging to attract suitably qualified
and experienced applicants to work in longer term posi-
tions on the trial. This may have been due to the per-
ceived risk of working in an Ebola-affected country,
because the trial site was in a relatively undeveloped
Mooney et al. 439
district, and because people with the relevant skills
were not available to apply for posts at short notice. In
addition, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical
Medicine is not an emergency response organisation
and therefore did not provide hardship or risk allowan-
ces to staff employed on the study.
Operational issues
Many operational challenges arose because the epi-
demic occurred in a region with a low level of develop-
ment; Sierra Leone remains among the world's poorest
countries and suffers from poor infrastructure.25
Outside an outbreak situation, a rural district like
Kambia would not be a natural choice for an urgent
trial due to the extensive requirements and costs of deli-
vering a Good Clinical Practice­compliant study in this
setting.
Kambia is not on the national power grid and there-
fore a 24 hour generator-based power supply was
installed for vaccine storage, offices, and laboratories,
and a fuel supply chain and fuel store were established.
While it was possible to rent, renovate, and equip exist-
ing buildings for the research clinics and offices, it was
necessary to construct a vaccine storage facility and
establish a research laboratory. Logistics became hugely
time-consuming, necessitating dedicated operations
staff to oversee construction, electrical installations,
and laboratory setup. In common with many emer-
gency situations, the cost of accommodation, rental and
construction of buildings, and goods such as furniture
rose substantially with the arrival of Ebola response
partners.
Emergency public health restrictions implemented to
curtail the spread of Ebola affected the establishment of
the study. For example, nightly curfews limited working
hours, including on the study-related construction and
renovations, and restricted the movement of people and
vehicles throughout the country.
However, engagement with the Ebola response
authorities allowed the team to gain special dispensa-
tion to assist with setting up the research project. These
included securing permits to allow team members to
travel during curfew periods in Kambia; and a blanket
exemption on import tax for equipment and
consumables.
Post-outbreak transition
The EBOVAC-Salone trial is now in the age de-
escalation stage of the trial and has experienced the
transition from working in an outbreak setting to a
post-outbreak setting, and the return to `business as
usual'.
The response infrastructure in Sierra Leone was
quickly dismantled once the outbreak ended and the
stakeholder landscape changed almost overnight as
roles and responsibilities at national and district level
reverted to their pre-Ebola position. The study team
had to reassess the potential influence of various indi-
viduals or institutions on the trial and adjust relation-
ships accordingly.
The dispensations related to the emergency situation
were suspended rapidly once the outbreak was declared
over. This included the waiver on importation taxes,
which was not clearly communicated to the research
team, thereby complicating the clearing of a subsequent
shipment.
After the outbreak had ended, interest in study par-
ticipation decreased, in part due to a shift in the risk/
benefit perception of members of the community, many
of whom felt that Ebola had been eradicated perma-
nently. The household lottery method for recruiting
participants was therefore expanded and a broader `first
come, first served' approach was adopted.
Post-outbreak, many of the logistical challenges
remain such as the lack of a mains power supply, and
staff recruitment and retention to a relatively remote
area of the country. Despite these challenges, the study
completed enrolment of adult participants in October
2016 and is recruiting participants into the age de-
escalation component of the trial. Over 100 Sierra
Leonean study personnel, including some Kambia
Government Hospital staff, have been trained in essen-
tial research skills and clinical management. This will
hopefully provide a legacy and a platform on which to
build further research in the district.
Recommendations
Following the experiences of establishing the
EBOVAC-Salone trial and the lessons learned between
2014 and 2017, we have a number of recommendations
for teams aiming to conduct research during epidemics.
Trial design
Research teams, funders, regulatory authorities, and
ethics committees should be flexible and prepared for
additional workloads when initiating and implementing
clinical trials in outbreak settings, as trial designs may
need to be adapted and submitted for review several
times over a short period. Modelling can be utilised to
predict trends and help identify research sites as the
epidemic unfolds. For trials of investigational medical
products, study design changes may continue after an
epidemic ends as the advice of international regulatory
authorities may also change if the results of the trial
are part of the submission for licensure. There is now a
substantial body of information regarding the accept-
ability of outbreak-specific trial designs from the Ebola
epidemic that could be used to inform template trial
designs in advance of future outbreaks.
440 Clinical Trials 15(5)
Partnerships
Identifying partnerships with established, on-the-
ground organisations may require urgent networking
and meetings to build trust and agree goals if partners
have not worked together before. Linkages with orga-
nisations that are not necessarily `classical' research
partners can be extremely valuable for implementing
research in an emergency situation.
Regulatory and ethics reviews
Ethical and regulatory authorities in countries with lim-
ited experience of clinical trials or other studies con-
ducted during an epidemic may need to be supported
by regional and international bodies to develop guide-
lines for study submissions during epidemics.
Additional funding may be required to increase capac-
ity for urgent reviews. The African Vaccine Regulatory
Forum and similar bodies can usefully support ethics
committees and regulators to facilitate the review and
approval of clinical trials conducted during an epidemic
if utilised at the right time, and sponsors and research-
ers should engage early with such a forum.
Ethical considerations
Experiences around ethical issues pertaining to the
design and implementation of clinical trials during the
Ebola epidemic should be considered for future out-
breaks. As soon as an outbreak is declared, the poten-
tial need for appropriate research should be considered
as an integral part of the response planning to ensure
that possible ethical concerns come to the fore and are
debated at the first possible opportunity. Research
must not have a detrimental impact on either the out-
break response or health systems.
Communications and engagement
Social scientists should be considered an integral part of
any large clinical trial team, particularly for trials in an
outbreak situation where it is vital to understand com-
munity dynamics and concerns that may change fre-
quently. During an outbreak, additional efforts may be
needed to explain and reinforce the distinction between
an investigational medical product and a licenced treat-
ment or vaccine, especially when fear of infection may
be more likely to influence participant decision-making.
Participant recruitment
Interest in participation may fluctuate based on com-
munity perceptions of risk associated with the outbreak
and the benefits of participation, and recruitment stra-
tegies may therefore need to be adapted as epidemics
evolve or wane.
Human resources
Researchers should engage local health authorities to
establish guidelines for recruiting staff to prevent weak-
ening outbreak responses or health systems.
Recruitment of certain cadres of staff from countries or
areas not affected by the outbreak may need to be con-
sidered, at least temporarily.
Operational issues
During an outbreak, researchers may need to choose
study sites that are not ideal in order to conduct the
study in a suitable target population while avoiding
other research projects. Researchers should respect
emergency restrictions, but may be able to explore dis-
pensations with the public health authorities if they do
not pose a risk to outbreak control activities.
Researchers should establish what happens to these dis-
pensations should the outbreak end.
Post-outbreak transition
Researchers should ensure that they identify and engage
both routine and response structures and government
regulations to help ensure continuity of support and
trial activities once an outbreak is over.
Conclusion
Many challenges have been identified while setting up
and implementing clinical trials during the West
African Ebola epidemic. We found that, despite imple-
menting a study with new research partners in a district
with poor infrastructure and health services, where clin-
ical research is in its infancy, interest in participation
was high. The EBOVAC-Salone study has enrolled a
total of 443 adults, 192 adolescents, and 132 children
between October 2015 and December 2017, and the
study continues to enrol younger cohorts of partici-
pants. However, in common with other research
groups, we recommend that research should be more
closely involved in outbreak response planning, which
could expedite the establishment of research projects
and maximise their chances of success.
While many of the lessons learned from the
EBOVAC-Salone experience will be specific to the con-
text of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, it is hoped
that the principles behind them are transferable to
research teams in other outbreak situations. These rec-
ommendations could be added to programmes and
strategies to improve the responses to future epidemics.
