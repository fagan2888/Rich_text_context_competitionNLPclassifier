This paper assesses the performance of monetary indicators in predicting euro area HICP
inflation out-of-sample over the period since the start of EMU considering a wide range of
forecasting models, including standard bivariate forecasting models, factor models, simple
combination forecasts as well as trivariate two-pillar Phillips Curve type forecasting models.
The results suggest that monetary indicators are still useful indicators for inflation in the euro
area, but that a thorough and broad based monetary analysis is needed to extract the
information content of monetary developments for future inflation.

Non-technical Summary
This paper assesses the performance of monetary indicators in predicting euro area HICP
inflation out-of-sample over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4 considering standard bivariate
forecasting models, factor models, simple combination forecasts as well as trivariate two-
pillar Phillips Curve type forecasting models, combining trend M3 growth with other non-
monetary indicators. In contrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro
area, this study employs and compares both direct and iterated forecasting models.
The results suggest that M3, especially its trend or core growth rate, was on average a useful
indicator for inflation at medium term horizons, which is consistent with the role of the
monetary analysis in the ECB's monetary policy strategy as a tool for the assessment of the
medium to long-term risks to price stability. But, a closer look at the forecasting performance
reveals that, over the last three years, the forecasting performance of M3 has not been as
good anymore as it used to be in the early years of EMU.
The further analysis reveals, however, that it might be premature to neglect monetary
indicators on these grounds. We find that a simple combination of all monetary forecasts
performs well also over the more recent period. Also, the extremely good and stable
performance of an M3 series corrected for the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3
since mid 2001 constructed by the ECB suggests that M3 is still a very useful indicator for
future price movements once the distorting effects of speculative portfolio flows are
identified and removed. These results therefore suggest on the whole that monetary
indicators are still useful indicators for inflation in the euro area, but that a thorough and
broad based monetary analysis is needed to extract the information content of monetary
developments for future inflation.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Dieses Papier untersucht die Güte monetärer Prognosen der HVPI Inflationsrate im Euroraum
über den Zeitraum erstes Quartal 1999 bis zum vierten Quartal 2005. Die Analyse stützt sich
auf einfache bivariate Prognosemodelle, Faktorenmodelle, Prognosekombinationsverfahren
sowie trivariate "Zwei-Säulen" Phillips-Kurven Prognosemodelle, bei denen die
Trendwachstumsrate von M3 mit anderen, nicht-monetären Indikatoren kombiniert wird. Im
Gegensatz zu anderen Studien zur Inflationsprognose im Euroraum verwendet und vergleicht
die vorliegende Studie sowohl direkte als auch iterative Prognosemodelle.
Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass vor allem die Trend-, oder Kernwachstumsrate von
M3 über den gesamten Betrachtungszeitraum ein nützlicher Indikator für die mittelfristige
Inflationsentwicklung im Euroraum war. Dieses Resultat ist konsistent mit der Rolle der
monetären Analyse in der geldpolitischen Strategie der EZB als ein Werkzeug zur
Einschätzung der mittel- bis langfristigen Risiken für die Preisstabilität. Eine genauere
Analyse der Entwicklung der Prognosegüte über die Zeit zeigt allerdings, dass die Güte von
monetären Inflationsprognosen in den letzten drei Jahren nicht so gut war wie in den ersten
Jahren der Währungsunion.
Die weitere Analyse verdeutlicht jedoch, dass es voreilig wäre, auf Basis dieser Evidenz
monetäre Indikatoren zu vernachlässigen. Zum einen liefern einfache Kombinationen
monetärer Inflationsprognosen auch in jüngerer Zeit befriedigende Ergebnisse. Zum anderen
zeigt sich, dass über den gesamten Erhebungszeitraum sehr gute Inflationsprognosen auf
Basis einer von der EZB konstruierten, um die Effekte spekulativer Portfolioumschichtungen
bereinigten M3 Reihe erzielt werden können. Diese Ergebnisse legen den Schluss nahe, dass
monetäre Indikatoren nach wie vor nützliche Informationen über die zukünftige
Inflationsentwicklung im Euroraum liefern, dass allerdings eine sorgfältige und breit angelegt
monetäre Analyse notwendig ist, um diese Informationen offenzulegen.

Do Monetary Indicators (still) Predict Euro Area Inflation?
1. Introduction
The main elements of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, announced on 13 October 1998
(ECB,1998) and confirmed and clarified on 8 May 2003 (ECB, 2003), are a quantitative
definition of price stability and a so-called "two-pillar" framework for the assessment of the
outlook for price developments and the current risks to price stability. The ECB's definition
of price stability is an annual increase in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of
below but close to two percent. The two-pillar framework for the assessment of the risks to
price stability combines a `'broadly based assessment of the outlook for the future price
developments'' based on a "wide range of economic and financial variables" (economic
analysis) and a "prominent role for money" with a reference value for the growth rate of the
broad monetary aggregate M3 (Money Pillar).1
The prominent role assigned to money in the ECB's monetary policy strategy was mainly
motivated by the conviction that the development of the price level in the medium to long-
term is a monetary phenomenon (ECB, 1999), which was supported by a number of empirical
studies showing that the long-run euro area M3 demand function was stable (Brand and
Cassola, 2000, Coenen and Vega, 1999 and Calza et al. 2001) and that M3 based indicators
were leading euro area inflation (e.g. Gerlach and Svensson 2000, Trecroci and Vega 2002
and Nicoletti Altimari 2001).
However, the ECB's special emphasis on the monetary analysis has been subject to intense
criticism from the very beginning. Besides theoretically motivated reservations against the
 I thank Jörg Breitung, Claus Greiber, Heinz Herrmann, Christian Schumacher, Jens Weidmann and
Andreas Worms for helpful comments and suggestions. The views expressed in this paper are solely
my own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
1 While the two pillars were originally described as two parallel analytical perspectives, the ECB
(2003) has clarified in the evaluation of its monetary policy strategy that the money pillar "mainly
serves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, the short to medium
term indications coming from economic analysis." In this context, the ECB has further clarified that
these medium to long-term risks to price stability are assessed based on a broad based monetary
analysis, which "will take into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators,
including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess
liquidity."
2
money pillar,2 it has also been argued that money might be an unreliable indicator for
inflation because of frequent shifts in velocity.3 In fact, since the beginning of EMU the
annual growth rate of the M3 monetary aggregate was almost continuously above the ECB's
reference value of 4.5%, since mid 2001 even substantially so, without showing signs of
reversion or triggering a tightening of policy rates or an acceleration in goods price inflation.
These developments appear to support the critics' view and have cast doubt on the usefulness
of M3 as an indicator of risks to price stability in the euro area.
In this paper we want to assess this issue by testing the performance of monetary indicators in
predicting euro area HICP inflation out-of-sample over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4.4 In
contrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro area, this study employs
and compares both direct and iterated forecasting models. Direct forecasts involve regressing
an h-period-ahead value of the dependent variable on its own lags and lagged values of other
indicators. H-periods ahead out-of-sample forecasts are then calculated as a one-step ahead
forecast from the estimated forecasting regression. Iterated forecasts entail estimating a VAR
or near-VAR model comprising the variable to be forecast and the other indicator variables
taken into account in the forecasting model. H-periods ahead forecasts are then obtained by
iterating the estimated VAR h-periods forward. Most empirical forecasting studies rely on the
direct approach to forecasting, motivated by theoretical findings that the h-step ahead
projection approach reduces the potential impact of specification error. However, the widely
accepted view that direct forecasting models are superior has recently been challenged.
Marcellino, Stock and Watson (2004) argue that choosing between direct and iterated
forecasts involves a trade-off between potential estimation bias and estimation variance.
2 As Galí (2003) puts it, while the pillar associated with the economic analysis can be related to
modern New Keynesian style models, "it is much harder, however, to think of a class of models that
would attribute a more direct role to money in the determination of inflation and which central bankers
could view as useful."
3Estrella and Mishkin (1997) have argued that volatility in money demand dominates movements in
money growth in an environment of subdued inflation and money growth, giving rise to a low signal-
to-noise ratio of money growth with respect to inflation. The same line of reasoning has also been
brought forward by Begg et al (2002) and De Grauwe and Polan (2005).
4Out-of-sample performance tests are commonly regarded as being superior to in-sample tests, as the
latter are commonly held to generate spurious rejections of the null of no predictability because of size
distortions arising from data mining (e.g. Granger, 1990). Other compelling reasons to rather rely on
out-of-sample tests is that they more accurately reflect the data and information constraints faced by
forecasters and policymakers in real-time and that in-sample tests may be misleading if there is a
structural break in the forecasting model (Stock and Watson, 2003). In the light of the recent
discussion of the potential instability of the link between M3 indicators and inflation in the euro area,
the last point is of particular relevance in the present context.
3
While the direct forecasts reduce the impact of model mis-specification bias, the iterated
forecasts produce more efficient forecasts when the models are correctly specified. In the
following we estimate both direct and iterated forecasting models of euro area HICP inflation
in order to see which approach works best for forecasting euro area inflation. This dual
approach also serves as a robustness check of the findings on the predictive ability of the
indicators considered.
The analysis starts by assessing the forecasting performance of simple bivariate forecasting
models considering a large number of aggregate euro area monetary and non-monetary
indicators. The forecasting performance of the indicators is evaluated against the forecasts
produced by simple autoregressive forecasting models of inflation. By taking a closer look at
the forecast errors we assess whether the forecasting performance of monetary indicators has
deteriorated over the more recent period. We also consider the performance of factor based
forecasts and simple forecast combination methods, which have commonly been found to
improve upon single indicator based forecasts.
Besides these more standard forecasting exercises, we further assess the usefulness of
trivariate forecasting models, combining the low frequency component of M3 growth with
other non-monetary indicators. This exercise is motivated by the recent literature on the role
of monetary aggregates in explaining inflation dynamics in the euro area. Gerlach (2003,
2004) has suggested to interpret the ECB's two pillar strategy as a combination of two
different models of the inflation process, the money pillar as a model of the longer-term
inflation trends and the economic analysis as a model of the short to medium-run
determinants of inflation, which can be formalised by a two-pillar Phillips Curve, adding
trend or core money growth to an otherwise standard empirical Phillips Curve. While several
studies have shown that such a two-pillar Phillips Curve provides a good in-sample fit for
euro area inflation5, the usefulness of the concept for forecasting inflation out-of-sample has
not yet been explored. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by considering the out-of-sample
performance of trivariate two-pillar Phillips curve type forecasting models.
Finally, we assess the relevance of the estimated effect of portfolio shifts on the out-of-sample
forecasting performance of M3 based indicators. The ECB has commonly argued that the high

Hofmann (2003).
4
growth rates of M3 observed since mid 2001 were driven by portfolio shifts caused by a
strong preference of investors for liquid assets in the wake of the exceptional economic and
financial uncertainties during this period and that the otherwise close link between M3 and
inflation has been temporarily blurred by this effect.6 The ECB constructs a measure of M3
corrected for the effect of portfolio shifts based on an ARIMA model of M3 augmented with
intervention variables to capture the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3.7 In order to
assess the effect of the estimated portfolio shift effects on the indicator property of M3 we
also assess the forecasting performance of the corrected M3 measure. Clearly, the portfolio
shift correction of the M3 aggregate is done based on ex-post information and was not
available ex-ante, so that the forecasting exercise is not a real assessment of the out-of-sample
performance of the corrected M3 measure. However, analysing the indicator property of the
corrected M3 measure is still useful as it gives an indication of whether M3 is in principle
still a useful indicator of inflation and whether the corrected M3 measure might be useful for
the current assessment of future risks to price stability.
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we assess the performance of simple univariate
and bivariate forecasting models. Section 3 investigates the performance of forecasts based on
factor analysis and simple forecast combination methods. In section 4 we assess the
performance of trivariate two-pillar Phillips Curve type forecasting models combining the
low frequency component of M3 growth with other non-monetary indicators. In section 5 we
investigate whether adjusting the euro area M3 series for the estimated effect of portfolio
shifts helps to improve the performance of M3 based indicators in forecasting inflation over
the more recent period. Section 6 concludes.
2. Standard autoregressive and bivariate forecasting models
In this section we assess the performance of univariate and bivariate forecasting models in
forecasting euro area HICP inflation over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4 in a pseudo or
simulated out-of-sample set-up. This means that forecasts are calculated using only data prior
to the forecasting period in order to most accurately reflect the data limitation faced by

forecasters in real time.8 The analysis employs both direct and iterated forecasting models and
is based on quarterly aggregate euro area data available for the period 1980Q1 till 2005Q4.9
Unless otherwise indicated, all data are official aggregate euro area data taken from the ECB
website, backdated with the corresponding series from the Area Wide Model (AWM)
database if necessary. The sample period for the recursive forecasting regressions starts in
1985Q1 in order to insure identical sample periods for all forecasting regressions and also to
mitigate the effect of the disinflation of the early 1980s on the results. The range of forecast
horizons considered is 1 to 12 quarters.
As a first step we assess simple univariate forecasting models of inflation, modelling the
inflation process solely as a function of its own lags. The univariate direct forecasting model
takes the form:
(1)
0 1
( )
h h
t h t t h
L u
   
+ +
= + + ,
where
t
 is the quarterly HICP inflation rate and h
t h

+
is the h-period ahead rate of change in
the HICP, so (400/ )ln( / )
h
t h t h t
h HICP HICP

+ +
= . The lag order was recursively determined
based on the Schwarz-Bayes information criterion (SBC) considering up to four lags. Since
we consider forecast horizons of 1 to 12 quarters, this means that we estimate at each
recursion twelve forecasting models (one for each forecast horizon), compare for each
forecasting model four model specifications and calculate one step ahead forecasts based on
the model with the best SBC.
The iterated autoregressive forecasting model is given by:
(2)
1 0 1 1
( )
t t t
L u
   
+ +
= + + ,
where again the lag order of the lagged endogenous variable was recursively selected using
the SBC. Here we estimate at each recursion only one forecasting model, compare four
specifications and calculate one to twelve steps ahead forecasts based on the model selected
8 Of course, in order to perform a "real" real time exercise one would need to use unrevised real time
data as they were available at the time the forecast was made. Such a real time database does
unfortunately not exist for the euro area.
9 A possible complementary approach to construct forecasts for euro area aggregates is to aggregate
individual country forecasts. See e.g. Marcellino et al. (2001) and Angelini et al. (2001).

by the SBC. Since equation (2) generates forecasts for quarterly inflation we have to obtain
the forecast for the h-period ahead inflation rate by calculating at each turn the h-period ahead
average of the quarterly inflation forecasts.
In Table 1 we report the Root-Mean-Squared forecast error (RMSE) produced by the
univariate forecasting models over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4. We also show the RMSE
produced by a simple random walk forecast, which takes the last observed inflation rate as the
forecast. Finally, we report in the last row of the table the ratio of the Mean squared forecast
error (MSE) produced by the direct forecast to the MSE produced by the iterated forecasts
with the p-value of the test the ratio is equal to one, i.e. that the forecast performance was not
significantly different, in parentheses.10 The results show that both autoregressive models
clearly outperform the random-walk forecast. The iterated forecasts perform slightly better
than the direct forecasts, but not significantly so. A look at the absolute forecast errors
produced by the two competing models since 1999 (Figure 1) shows that the iterated forecast
model also performs better in the majority of periods, though, with few exceptions, only by a
small margin.11

forecasts - (0.81) (0.58) (0.72) (0.63) (0.75) (0.76) (0.82) (0.88) (0.92) (0.94) (0.97)
Note: The table reports the root mean squared forecast error (RMSE) for the direct, the
iterated and the random walk forecasting model over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4. The last
row reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the direct
forecasting model to the MSE of the iterated forecasting model with p-values of a test that it
is equal to one in parentheses. An MSE ratio smaller (larger) than one therefore indicates
that the direct model performs better (worse) than the iterated model.
10 The standard error for the MSE ratio was calculated based on a heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimate of the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix of the forecast
errors using the  -method. The HAC estimate of the VCV matrix was obtained using a Bartlett
kernel with the number of lags equal to the forecast horizon. This approach to forecast evaluation,
which has been suggested by West (1996), is applicable in this context since the direct and iterated
forecasting models are non-nested at forecast horizons 2 to 12.
11The finding that the iterated forecasts perform in general better than the direct forecasts is consistent
with the findings by Marcellino et al. (2004) for the US.

Taking the autoregressive forecasts as the benchmark, we assess as the next step bivariate
forecasting models of inflation, modelling the inflation process as a function of its own lags
and lags of one other indicator variable x. The bivariate direct forecasting model is given by:

The lag order was again determined based on the SBC, allowing for different lag orders
across regressors and also across equations in the case of the iterated forecasting model
searching respectively over up to four lags. Forecasts were then computed in the same way as
for the univariate forecasting models.
The performance of the single indicator forecasting models is evaluated based on the ratio of
the MSE produced by the bivariate models to the MSE produced by the respective univariate
model. A caveat is that the evaluation has to be based on the relative MSE number only. Due
to the recursive lag order selection, the bivariate and univariate models are at some dates
nested and at some dates not, so that neither the forecast evaluation approach suggested by
West (1996) for non-nested models nor the approach suggested by Clark and McCracken
(2001) for nested models is applicable (Stock and Watson, 2003).12
We consider four monetary growth indicators: The quarterly growth rates of the monetary
aggregates M1, M2, M3 and of bank loans to the private sector (dm1, dm2, dm3, dloans).13
Against the background of the recent literature which has stressed that it is only the low
frequency movements in M3 which are relevant for inflation14 we also consider the trend, or
core growth rate of the M3 aggregate (dm3t), calculated using a one side Hodrick-Prescott
(HP) filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600.15 We further consider three M3 indicators
derived from the long-run money demand model: the change in p-star (dpstar), the real
money gap (mgap) and the monetary overhang (mov). These indicators are derived from a
recursively estimated long-run M3 demand function using the current consensus specification
proposed by Calza et al (2001)16 given by

12 Giacomini and White (2004) have recently suggested a test which is applicable to both nested and
non-nested models. However, the test requires moving window estimation of the forecasting
regressions, while we perform recursive estimation throughout. We also experimented with moving
window estimation of the forecasting regressions but found these forecasting models to perform much
worse than the recursively estimated models.
13 The seasonally adjusted series for private sector loans from the ECB website was spliced with the
series constructed by Calza et al. (2001) in 1991Q1. All quarterly monetary series are monthly
averages.
14 See e.g. Gerlach (2003, 2004), Neumann and Greiber (2005) and, more recently, Assenmacher-
Wesche and Gerlach (2006).
15 We also experimented with other values of the smoothing parameter. The lower the smoothing
parameter the more closely the filtered series adjusts to the actual series, so that the results become
increasingly similar to the ones obtained from the quarterly M3 growth rate. Higher values of the

Besides these eight monetary indicators we further consider a number of non-monetary
indicators: quarterly real GDP growth (dgdpr), the level and first difference of the output
gap18 (ygap and dygap), the level and first difference of the unemployment rate (unr and
dunr), the log level and quarterly growth rate of total employment (emp and demp), the level
and first difference of the short-term interest rate (irs and dirs), level and first difference of the
long-term interest rate (irl and dirl), the yield spread (long-term rate less short-term rate), the
quarterly rate of change in the share price index (dsp), the quarterly rate of change in the
producer price index (dppi), the log level and quarterly growth rate of real unit labour costs19
(rulc and drulc), the quarterly rate of change in nominal unit labour costs (dulc), quarterly
nominal wage inflation (dwage), quarterly import price inflation (dimpp), the quarterly rate of
change in the nominal effective exchange rate (dexr), the quarterly rate of change in the euro
based commodity price index20 (dcom) and the quarterly rate of change the euro based world
oil price index21 (doil).
Tables 2 and 3 present the results. An MSE ratio less (larger) than one means that the
bivariate model has produced a lower (larger) MSE than the autoregressive model. The results
suggest that the M3 growth indicators improve upon the autoregressive forecast at forecast
horizons beyond six to eight quarters, while the M3-demand based indicators as well as the
other monetary growth indicators do in general not outperform the autoregressive forecast. In
17 The data for the own rate of M3 were taken from Calza et al (2001) and extended by own calculations using
Bundesbank data.
18The output gap is calculated as the percent deviation of real GDP from its long-run trend obtained using a one
sided HP filter with smoothing parameter 1600.
19 Nominal unit labour cost deflated with the GDP deflator.
20 The commodity price index is the HWWA US-$ based commodity price index converted to  using the
historical -$ exchange rate from the OECD Economic Outlook database.

database also converted to  using the historical -$ exchange rate series.

accordance with the findings of the recent literature on the information content of low
frequency movements in money for inflation already referred to above, we find that the best
performing monetary indicator is the one sided HP-filtered M3 growth rate. In the group of
non-monetary indicators, only the change in nominal wages and, to a lesser extent, the change
in nominal unit labour costs, generate better forecasts than the autoregressive forecasting
models. In fact, nominal wage inflation is the best performing single indicator at forecast
horizons beyond four quarters, except for direct forecasts beyond the two year horizon, where
the M3 growth indicators perform better. A more detailed assessment of the relative
performance of the direct and the iterated forecasting approach is provided in the appendix.
On the whole, the results suggest that M3 growth contains useful information about future
HICP inflation in the euro area at least at longer prediction horizons. This finding is consistent
with the results reported by Nicoletti Altimari (2001). However, as we have already discussed
in the introduction, since 2001 euro area M3 growth has been well above the ECB's reference
value, without triggering an acceleration of inflation or an increase in ECB policy rates. This
suggests that the usefulness of M3 growth as an inflation indicator may have deteriorated over
the more recent time period.
In order to assess this point we take a closer look at the forecast errors produced by the M3
growth indicator models over time. Figures 2 and 3 show the absolute forecast errors
produced by the quarterly M3 growth model and the trend M3 growth model respectively
together with the absolute forecast error produced by the autoregressive forecasting model.
The graphs reveal that the good average forecasting performance of the M3 growth indicators
for longer forecast horizons over the sample period is mainly driven by the very good
performance of these indicators, especially for the direct forecasting models, over the first two
years of EMU. Since 2003, however, the money growth indicators cannot outperform the
autoregressive forecasts anymore. Compared to this, the forecasting performance of wage
inflation, which we show in Figure 4, has been more stable. The wage inflation based
forecasts did not perform as well as the direct money growth forecasts in 1999 and 2000, but
continuously outperform the autoregressive forecasts over the full sample period.

3. Factor based forecasts and forecast combinations
In order to avoid over-parameterisation of the forecasting models, time series forecasting of
economic variables usually focuses on low-dimensional models like the autoregressive or
single indicator models considered in the previous section. The disadvantage of this approach
is that when the information content of one or a group of indicators is considered, the
information contained in the other available indicators is not taken into account. In order to
combine and condense the information contained in a large group of indicators, two
approaches have been suggested in the literature: the use of diffusion indices or factors, which
extract the main common driving forces (factors) of a group of indicators before estimating
the forecasting model, and the use of forecast combination methods, which combine the
forecasts produced by the single indicator models.
Factor models suppose that a group of indicator variables is driven by a few common factors
which may summarise their information content for forecasting purposes. Stock and Watson
(2002) propose to use static principal components analysis to derive the common factors.22 In
this framework, we obtain the first r static factors for a group of n indicators over a sample
period of size T from
t t
F X
=  , where F is a Txr matrix of static factors, X is a Txn matrix of
observable indicators and  is an nxr matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest
eigenvalues of the sample variance-covariance matrix of the indicator variables. In order to
assess the performance of factor based forecasts we first recursively determine the number of
factors using the
2
P
IC criterion of Bai and Ng (2002)23 and then estimate based on the thus
determined number of factors direct and iterated forecasting models. We perform the principal
component analysis separately for the group of monetary indicators and the group of non-
monetary indicators and also for the group of all indicators together, considering one factor
for the group of monetary indicators, up to two factors for the group of non-monetary
22 Recently, Forni et al. (2003) and Kapetanios and Marcellino (2004) have extended the static
framework developed by Stock and Watson to also allow for dynamic relationships between the
variables in the model. However, these extensions impose a certain structure on the dynamics of the
system which may not be consistent with the data and also have a more complicated structure, so that
that they are more prone to misspecification in empirical applications. Boivin and Ng (2005)
investigate the forecasting performance of the different approaches to factor derivation and conclude
that the Stock and Watson approach outperforms the other approaches just because of these caveats.
For these reasons we rely on the Stock and Watson approach to derive the factors.

indicators and up to three factors for the group of all indicators. For each recursion the
forecasting model is specified according to the number of common factors selected by the
2
P
IC criterion. The dynamic specification is then chosen based on the SBC criterion as in the
previous section considering up to four lags for each regressor and allowing lag orders to
differ across regressors and across equations.24
An alternative to constructing composite indicators based on principal component analysis is
to first estimate the forecasting models for the individual indicator variables and then to
combine the forecasts using forecast combination techniques.25 The combination forecast is
given by
1
n
c
t it it
i
f f

=
=  , where
it
f is the forecast produced by indicator i in period t and
it

is the weight given to this forecast. The combination forecasts we consider here are the mean
and the median of the forecasts produced by the bivariate models estimated in the previous
section.26 We again recursively perform the analysis separately for the group of monetary
indicators and the group of non-monetary indicators and also for all indicators together.
Table 4 reports the relative MSEs of the factor based forecasts and of the forecast
combinations with respect to the autoregressive forecast.27 The results suggest that the
forecast combination methods perform better than the factor based forecasts, which is
consistent with the findings of Stock and Watson (2004). The mean forecast, in particular for
the group of monetary indicators, can clearly improve upon the autoregressive forecast and on
average also tends to perform better than the bivariate forecasts of the previous section.
24 This means, for example, that if at one of the recursions three factors were selected for the whole
group of indicators, four dimensional forecasting models had to be estimated. In the case of the direct
forecasting model this entailed regressing h-period ahead inflation on its own lags and lags of the three
factors selecting the lag order of the regressors based on the SBC, which means comparing for each
forecasting horizon 256 models and selecting the one with the best SBC. For the iterated forecasting
models a four equation SUR had to be estimated with lag orders of the four equations determined by
the SBC, which means that 256 models had to be compared for each equation of the SUR.
25 For surveys of the forecast combination literature see Diebold and Lopez (1996), Newbold and
Harvey (2002) and Hendry and Clements (2002).
26 More sophisticated forecast combination methods base the forecast weights in some way on
previous forecast performance. Due to the small sample period we do not have sufficient forecast
observations to apply such more sophisticated combination methods. However, in their comparison of
the forecast performance of various forecast combination methods, Stock and Watson (2004) find that
simple forecast combinations, like the mean, tend to perform better than more sophisticated methods.
27 A comparison of the performance of the direct and the iterated forecasts shows that, as in the case of
the autoregressive and single indicator models, the iterated forecasts tend to perform somewhat better
than the direct forecast, except for the longest forecast horizons. But the MSE ratios are again never
significantly different from one. We do not report the results here for brevity, but they are available
upon request.

Note: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the
respective forecasting model to the MSE of the autoregressive forecasting model. M refers to
the group of monetary indicators, NM to the group of non-monetary indicators and T to the
total group of monetary and non-monetary indicators. An MSE ratio smaller (larger) than
one therefore indicates that the model performs better (worse) than the autoregressive model.
Figure 5 takes a closer look at the forecasting performance of the mean forecast of the
monetary indicators over time. The graphs reveal that the mean monetary forecast not only
performed very well on average, but that the performance was also very stable over time. The
finding that simple combination forecasts may improve upon autoregressive forecasts even
when the forecasts based on individual predictors are unstable over time and on average
perform worse than an autoregressive benchmark is consistent with findings reported by
Stock and Watson (2003) who study the performance of forecast combination techniques in
forecasting GDP growth in the G7 countries. An implication of this result is that a broader
based monetary analysis, taking into account the information content of a larger group of
monetary indicators, may yield a more reliable and more robust assessment of inflation trends
than focusing on a single monetary indicator.

4. A two-pillar Phillips Curve forecasting model
In the evaluation of its monetary policy strategy, the ECB (2003) has emphasised that the
economic analysis within the framework of its non-monetary pillar serves to "identify short to
medium term risks to price stability", while the monetary analysis in the framework of its
money pillar assesses the "medium to long-term trends in inflation". This phrasing suggests
that the ECB's two pillar strategy may be interpreted as a combination of two separate
forecasting models for inflation, the non-monetary pillar for the short to medium-run and the
money pillar for the medium to long-run (Gerlach 2003, 2004). As a way to formalise this
view of the inflation process, several studies have adopted a two-pillar Phillips Curve model,
specifying the euro area inflation process as a function of trend or core money growth and
some measure of the output gap. 28 While these studies have shown that such a two-pillar
Phillips Curve model provides a good in-sample fit for euro area inflation, the usefulness of
the concept for forecasting inflation out-of-sample has not yet been explored.
In this section we proceed to forecast euro area inflation based on trivariate, two-pillar
Phillips Curve type forecasting models, modelling inflation as a function of its own lags, lags
of trend money growth measured as the growth rate of one sided HP filtered M3 ( T
t
m
 ), and
lags of a non-monetary indicator (x). The trivariate direct and iterated forecasting models are
respectively given by

Lag orders were selected and forecasts computed recursively in the same way as for the
univariate and bivariate models, allowing for different lag orders across regressors and also
across equations in the case of the iterated forecasting model searching over up to four lags
respectively.
28 See Gerlach (2003, 2004), Neumann (2003), Neumann and Greiber (2005) and von Hagen and
Hofmann (2003).

Tables 5 and 6 report the ratio of the MSE produced by the trivariate forecasting models to
the MSE produced by the respective univariate model. For comparison we also report in the
first row of the tables the relative MSE for the bivariate model including trend M3 growth.
Besides considering each non-monetary indicator separately, we also consider a factor based
forecast29 and the mean and median of the trivariate forecasts. The results suggest that the
trivariate models perform very well, on the whole clearly outperforming the autoregressive
forecast over the full sample period. Some of the trivariate models also outperform the best
bivariate forecasting models and also the forecast combinations considered in the previous
section. For the direct forecasting model, a true two-pillar Phillips Curve model comprising
trend money growth and the output gap performs best on average, while for the iterated
forecasts a trivariate model comprising wage inflation is the best performer. A more detailed
assessment of the relative performance of the direct and the iterated forecasting approach is
again provided in the appendix.
On the whole, the results suggest that the two-pillar Phillips Curve forecasting model is a
useful tool for forecasting inflation. However, a closer look at the performance of the models
over time reveals that also the trivariate models were not able to outperform the
autoregressive models over the more recent time period. Figure 6 shows as an example the
performance of the trivariate model with the output gap as the non-monetary indicator. The
graphs show that while the model performs better than the bivariate model with M3 growth,
its predictive ability relative to the simple autoregressive forecasting model has also
deteriorated since 2003.30
29 The factor analysis is performed in the same way as in the previous section, considering up to two
factors.
30 For the other non-monetary indicators we obtain a very similar picture. The results are available
upon request.

5. Portfolio shift effects
The ECB has commonly argued that the high growth rates of M3 since 2001 have been driven
by transitory portfolio shifts caused by a strong preference of investors for liquid assets in the
wake of the exceptional economic and financial uncertainties during this period.31 This would
imply that the information content of M3 indicators for inflation has only temporarily been
blurred and that a correction of M3 for the effect of portfolio shifts would restore the indicator
property of M3 for inflation trends.
The ECB constructs a measure of M3 corrected for the effect of portfolio shifts based on a
seasonal reg-ARIMA model ­ regression model with seasonal ARIMA errors - of the log-
transformed index of adjusted stocks of euro area M3, which captures the portfolio shift
effects since 2001 by means of intervention variables (ECB, 2005). The portfolio shifts
between March and October 2001 and between September 2002 and May 2003 are
respectively modelled by a linear trend. The gradual unwinding of past portfolio shifts in the
period from mid-2003 to mid-2004 is assumed to proceed linearly at a quarter of the pace
observed for the earlier shifts into M3.32 For the stochastic part of the model an ARIMA
(0,1,1) [0,1,1] model is used.33
In order to assess the effect of the estimated portfolio shift effects on the indicator property of
M3 we analyse the out-of sample forecasting performance of the ECB portfolio shift
corrected M3 series. An obvious objection is that the portfolio shift correction of the M3
aggregate is done based on ex-post information and was not available ex-ante, so that the
forecasting exercise is not a real assessment of the out-of-sample performance of the corrected
M3 measure. However, analysing the indicator property of the corrected M3 measure is still
useful as it gives an indication of whether M3 is in principle still a useful indicator of inflation
and whether the corrected M3 measure might be of use for the current assessment of future
risks to price stability.
31 See e.g. ECB (2004).
32An alternative approach has been proposed by Greiber and Lemke (2005), who capture the effect of
portfolio shifts on the demand for M3 by including measures of aggregate risk to an otherwise
standard specification of the M3 demand function. They show that including these measures
substantially reduces the estimated monetary overhang at the end of the sample period.
33 The parenthesis term refers to the specification of the regular part and the bracket term refers to the
specification of the seasonal part of the model. The chosen specification states that for both parts a
specification with no AR components, first order differencing and a first order moving average was
chosen.
26
Table 7 shows the relative MSEs with respect to the autoregressive forecasts for the bivariate
forecasting model with portfolio shift corrected M3 indicators. We consider again the
quarterly growth and the trend M3 growth rate34 as well as recursively calculated M3 demand
based indicators, namely the change in p-star (dpstar), the real money gap (mgap) and the
monetary overhang (mov). The results suggest that the portfolio shift corrected M3 growth
indicators deliver for all forecast horizons on average better forecasts than the unadjusted M3
series. In fact, the bivariate models for the adjusted M3 growth indicators deliver lower MSE
ratios than all the bivariate models, forecast combinations and trivariate models we have
considered in the previous sections. A look at the forecasting performance of the corrected
M3 growth indicators over time, shown in Figures 7 and 8, reveal that when M3 is cleansed
from the estimated effects of portfolio shifts, it outperforms the autoregressive forecast also
over the more recent time period.

ratio smaller (larger) than one therefore indicates that the model performs better (worse)
than the autoregressive model.

parameter of 1600.

6. Conclusions
The money pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which stresses the importance of
monetary indicators, in particular of the broad monetary aggregate M3, for medium to long-
run risks to price stability, has been subject to intense criticism from the very beginning. The
continued brisk growth of M3 since mid 2001, which did not trigger a tightening of policy
rates or an acceleration in goods price inflation, appears to support the critics' view and has
cast doubt on the usefulness of M3 as an indicator of risks to price stability in the euro area.
In this paper we assess this issue by testing the performance of monetary indicators in
predicting euro area HICP inflation out-of-sample over the period 1999Q1 till 2005Q4. In
contrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro area, this study employs
and compares both direct and iterated forecasting models. The paper further contributes to the
literature by assessing the out-of-sample forecasting performance of trivariate two-pillar
Phillips Curve type forecasting models, combining trend M3 growth with other non-monetary
indicators, which have so far only been shown to provide a good in-sample fit of euro area
inflation dynamics.
The results suggest that M3, especially its trend or core growth rate, was over the EMU period
on average a useful indicator for inflation at medium term horizons, which is consistent with
the role of the monetary analysis in the ECB's monetary policy strategy as a tool for the
assessment of the medium to long-term risks to price stability. However, a closer look at the
forecasting performance reveals that M3 has become less useful as an inflation indicator over
recent years. Since 2003, even the on average best performing trend M3 growth indicator
cannot outperform simple autoregressive forecasting models of inflation. The further analysis
suggests, however, that it might be premature to discard monetary indicators on these
grounds. In particular, we find that a simple combination of all monetary forecasts performs
well also over the more recent period. Also, the extremely good and stable performance of an
M3 series corrected for the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3 since mid 2001
constructed by the ECB suggests that M3 is still a very useful indicator for future price
movements once the distorting effects of speculative portfolio flows are identified and
removed. Taken all together, the answer to the question of whether monetary indicators still
predict inflation in the euro area is probably yes, but a thorough and broad based monetary
analysis appears to be needed to extract the information content of monetary developments
for future inflation.

Appendix
Comparing the performance of direct and iterated forecasting models
In Appendix-Tables 1 and 2 we assess respectively the relative performance of the two
competing forecasting approaches, the direct and the iterated approach, for the bivariate and
the trivariate forecasting models. We compare for each indicator variable the ratio of the MSE
from the direct forecast to that of the iterated forecast. For the bivariate models the results
suggest that, on the whole, the iterated forecasting models deliver lower MSEs than the direct
forecasting models except maybe for the M3 growth based indicators at longer forecasting
horizons.35 The results for the trivariate models suggest that the iterated method works better
for shorter forecast horizons, while the direct forecasting approach appears to perform better
at longer horizons. Since the direct and the iterated forecasting models are non-nested for
forecast horizons 2 to 12 we also performed a test of the statistical significance of the MSE
ratio as we have done for the autoregressive forecasts below following the approach
suggested by West (1996), i.e. we calculate the standard error for the MSE ratio based on a
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimate of the variance-covariance
(VCV) matrix of the forecast errors using the  -method.36 The results of this test, which we
do not report for brevity, reveal that the MSE ratios are never significantly different from
one, implying that the forecasting performance of the direct and iterated models is not
significantly different. 37
35 Note that, although the specification of the forecasting equation for the inflation rate in the direct
and the iterated forecasting model are identical, the MSE ratio is not equal to one as has been the case
in the autoregressive forecasting model because the iterated forecasting model here also comprises a
forecasting equation for the indicator variable which is estimated jointly with the inflation equation by
SUR, which also affects the coefficient estimates in the inflation equation.
36 The HAC estimate of the VCV matrix was obtained using a Bartlett kernel with the number of lags
equal to the forecast horizon.
37 The p-values of the tests are available upon request.
