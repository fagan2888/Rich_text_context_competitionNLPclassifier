Using data from the current National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999­2000), the authors as-
sessed whether Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in
the United States. Iron deficiency was defined as at least two abnormal results out of three biomarkers of iron
stores. IDA was defined as a low hemoglobin level in the presence of iron deficiency. H. pylori infection was
measured by serology. Complex survey estimators were used in the analysis. For 7,462 survey participants aged
3 years, H. pylori infection was associated with decreased serum ferritin levels (percent change ¼ ÿ13.9%, 95%
confidence interval (CI): ÿ19.5, ÿ8.0) but not with levels of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation,
or hemoglobin (percent change ¼ 1.5%, ÿ2.8%, and ÿ1.1%, respectively). Multinomial logistic regression anal-
yses indicated that H. pylori infection was associated with the prevalence of IDA (prevalence odds ratio (POR) ¼
2.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 4.6) and, to a lesser degree, other types of anemia (POR ¼ 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.7). H. pylori
infection was associated with a 40% increase in the prevalence of iron deficiency (POR ¼ 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9, 2.0)
after controlling for relevant covariates. In the United States, H. pylori infection was associated with iron deficiency/
IDA regardless of the presence or absence of peptic ulcer disease.

Iron deficiency, defined as decreased total body iron
content, is among the most common nutritional deficiencies
in the world. Iron deficiency results in impairments in im-
mune, cognitive, and reproductive functions, as well as
decreased work performance. Iron deficiency develops
through three stages: 1) iron depletion, 2) iron-deficient
erythropoiesis, and 3) iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) (1).
Although the mechanisms remain unclear, clinical and epi-
demiologic studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter
pylori is associated with iron deficiency and IDA (2, 3).
Barabino (2) hypothesized that gastritis increased levels of
neutrophil-derived lactoferrin, and since H. pylori has a
lactoferrin-binding protein receptor, the infection would
result in increased iron losses related to bacterial turn-
over. A study of children in Alaska showed that anemia re-
sponded to oral iron replacement but recurred when iron
therapy was discontinued, suggesting that mild chronic
bleeding was involved (4). It seems likely that the patho-
genesis is multifactorial, including combinations of reduced
iron absorption related to decreased acid secretion, in-
creased iron loss from microbleeding, and utilization by
bacteria.

Successful interventions in the United States targeting
high-risk groups for iron supplementation led to a significant
reduction in iron deficiency and IDA in the 1960s (5­7).
However, the impact of such programs has leveled off, par-
ticularly among women of childbearing age and toddlers
(6). We used data from the current (1999­2000) National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to
assess the association between H. pylori infection and the
prevalence of iron deficiency, IDA, and anemia from other
causes in the most current large representative sample of the
US population. Specifically, we tested whether mean levels
of different markers of iron stores or prevalences of iron
deficiency, IDA, and anemia from other causes differed ac-
cording to H. pylori infection status. We also examined
whether this relation was limited to adults with a history
of peptic ulcer disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Details on the design and methods of NHANES have
been published elsewhere (8). In brief, the National Center
for Health Statistics collects data on a representative sample
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population in 2-year
cycles. In the 1999­2000 NHANES, questionnaire, labora-
tory, and examination data were collected from 9,965 survey
participants to obtain national estimates of the prevalence of
selected health conditions. This cycle was the first phase of
NHANES IV (1999­2004). By design, ethnic minorities are
oversampled in NHANES to allow evaluation of the health
status of specific racial/ethnic groups and comparisons be-
tween them.
Since 1976­1980 (i.e., NHANES II), the case definitions
of iron deficiency and IDA used by the National Center for

Health Statistics have been based on age- and gender-
specific cutoff values (6). Anemia was considered present
if hemoglobin levels were low according to these cutoff
values. Iron deficiency was defined as at least two abnormal
results in three tests of iron status measuring levels of free
erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and se-
rum ferritin. The specific laboratory methods used to mea-
sure levels of hemoglobin and iron indicators have been
described elsewhere (6). Briefly, hemoglobin was measured
using an automated electronic counter, while immunoradio-
metric, colorimetric, and fluorescence extraction assays
were used to measure serum ferritin, iron and iron binding
capacity, and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, respectively
(6). In the 1999­2000 NHANES, H. pylori infection was
measured using the Wampole enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (9) among 7,493 participants aged 3 years.
Thus, the sample population for this cross-sectional study
consisted of participants aged 3 years. We excluded the
records of participants without valid information on anemia
and iron-store status; this left an analytic sample of 7,462
participants.
In our analyses, we took into account the complex survey
design of NHANES, using replicate weight jackknife esti-
mators available in SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 8.1;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) to characterize the distribution of indicators of
iron stores and the prevalences of iron deficiency and IDA
by H. pylori infection status and other selected variables.
Mean values and standard errors for serum ferritin, percent
transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin were
compared using multiple linear regression analysis that con-
trolled for several potential confounders. We examined as
potential confounders selected factors that have been pre-
viously found to be associated with iron deficiency or
H. pylori infection in NHANES. Forty percent of the US
population uses multivitamin and mineral supplements
(10); information on iron intake from supplements was not
readily available in the current NHANES. We also found

evidence of confounding by channel: that is, persons with
anemia or at high risk of anemia seemed more likely to
report higher iron intakes in 24-hour dietary recalls. There-
fore, we decided to limit the analysis to actual levels of
biomarkers of iron stores.
Previous studies with NHANES data have used the pov-
erty income ratio as a proxy for socioeconomic status (11).
The poverty income ratio is computed as reported household
income divided by the US poverty threshold, which is de-
termined annually by the Bureau of the Census and adjusted
for inflation. The National Center for Health Statistics cal-
culated these values for each record. For assessment of renal
insufficiency in adults, we used cutoff values of estimated
glomerular filtration rates derived from serum creatinine
levels as done in NHANES III (12). Levels of vitamin C
have been found to be inversely related to H. pylori infection
(13) and to enhance iron uptake (14). We selected variables
for these linear and logistic models by entering those that
separately or jointly changed the crude point estimates in
a meaningful way (presented in the reduced model) (15). We
also obtained results for all potential confounders (presented
in the full model).
Thus, the analyses controlled for age, gender, ethnicity,
place of birth, education, poverty income ratio, current preg-
nancy status, number of previous pregnancies, vitamin C
intake, diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to take ad-
vantage of the full range of values for the outcome variables.
The levels of all markers of iron deficiency were logarith-
mically transformed, and the percent change was obtained
by retransforming the values to the original scale. The log-
arithmic transformation centered the distribution of data on
some markers and simplified the process of estimating dif-
ferences between means, which were expressed as percent
change. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to
model the prevalence of iron deficiency (determined to be
present or absent using age- and gender-specific cutoff val-
ues). Prevalence odds ratios and their 95 percent confidence
intervals were calculated in bivariate, stratified, and multi-
variate analyses of the association between H. pylori infec-
tion and iron deficiency, while multiple multinomial logistic
regression was used to assess the relation between H. pylori
infection and a three-level dependent variable: 1) IDA,
2) anemia from other causes, and 3) no anemia and normal
values for iron-store indicators. Multinomial logistic regres-
sion allowed us to compare two categories of anemia (IDA
and anemia from other causes) using a common referent.
Records that had missing data on covariates or were not
applicable (e.g., for missing data on current pregnancy sta-
tus, females other than those aged 12­59 years and all males)
were treated as a separate category in multivariate analyses.
To address the specific question of whether the H. pylori
association was explained by ulcers and bleeding resulting
from this infection, we used data on history of peptic ulcer
disease available for the subset of adult NHANES partici-
pants. Specifically, we created a four-level composite expo-
sure variable that combined H. pylori infection status and
history of peptic ulcer, using persons exposed to neither as
the reference category. We assessed effect modification by
relevant covariates, such as race/ethnicity, using this com-
posite exposure variable approach. Statistical interaction
in the context of linear regression was tested using a chi-
squared test for product terms. Population attributable
fraction estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency due
to H. pylori infection were calculated using Greenland
estimators (16).
RESULTS
In the study population, 27.1 percent (95 percent confi-
dence interval (CI): 24.8, 29.4), 6.6 percent (95 percent CI:
5.7, 7.6), 1.9 percent (95 percent CI: 1.4, 2.6), and 3.3 per-
cent (95 percent CI: 2.7, 4.1) had H. pylori infection, iron
deficiency, IDA, and anemia from other causes, respectively.
The distribution of the correlates of these three conditions is
shown in table 1. No results of statistical testing are shown
in table 1; its main purpose is to depict the patterns of
occurrence of the dependent and independent variables ac-
cording to select covariates. H. pylori infection increased
with age and was more prevalent among racial/ethnic mi-
norities, persons born outside the United States, non-
breastfed children, the poor, and persons in the lowest
quintile of vitamin C intake. The prevalence of iron defi-
ciency was increased among females, ethnic minorities,
pregnant women, and women with multiple previous preg-
nancies. Some of the stratum-specific estimates of IDAwere
unreliable because of small numbers; however, increases in
prevalence were noted among the same groups that experi-
enced iron deficiency, as well as other subgroups (females
aged 16­69 years and the foreign-born), while no differen-
ces in the prevalence of IDA were found by poverty income
ratio. Anemia from other causes was more prevalent among
non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Mexican-American Hispanics,
poor persons, women who were currently pregnant or had
had previous multiple pregnancies, persons who had been
medically diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure,
and persons with serum creatinine levels compatible with
renal impairment. We found no relation between iron de-
ficiency/IDA and smoking or regular alcohol intake, and
these factors were not considered in further analyses as
covariates.
Table 2 presents the results of multiple linear regression
analysis of the biomarkers of iron deficiency. H. pylori in-
fection was associated with an important decrease in levels
of serum ferritin across the entire US population, after simul-
taneous adjustment for relevant covariates. The associations
between H. pylori infection and other indicators of iron
stores were of comparatively small magnitude or were null.
As table 3 shows, results of the multinomial analysis in-
dicated that the prevalence of IDA among H. pylori-infected
participants was increased. Point estimates were meaning-
fully changed by age, gender, ethnicity, and gestational his-
tory (current and past). In a reduced model, we added
poverty to these variables as a proxy for socioeconomic
status. The relations between the prevalence of H. pylori
infection and IDA were similar in the reduced model after
adjustment for this set of variables and in the fully adjusted
model. Table 3 also shows the H. pylori infection prevalence
odds ratio for anemia from other causes: prevalence was

Am J Epidemiol 2006;163:127­134
increased by 30 percent in both the reduced model and the
full model. In addition, after adjustment for all covariates
via multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of
iron deficiency increased by 40 percent among H. pylori-
infected participants. Measures of association from the re-
duced model were consistent with such an increase.
Ten percent of US adults reported ever having been di-
agnosed with peptic ulcers, and half of them tested positive
for immunoglobulin G H. pylori antibodies, while 88 per-
cent of H. pylori-infected adults in our study population had
no history of medically diagnosed ulcers. The association
between H. pylori infection and iron deficiency/IDA seemed
slightly stronger among adults who reported a history of
medically diagnosed peptic ulcer disease, as shown in table 4,
while serum ferritin levels and prevalences of iron de-
ficiency or IDA among persons with a history of peptic
ulcer disease but without antibodies to H. pylori were
similar to those of persons who had neither H. pylori in-
fection nor a history of peptic ulcer.
The relations between H. pylori infection and iron defi-
ciency and IDA seemed stronger among non-Hispanic
Whites and persons of other/mixed ethnicity and seemed
weaker or nonexistent among other persons in other racial/
ethnic groups (data not shown). The percent change in serum
ferritin level associated with H. pylori infection status among
non-Hispanic Whites and persons of other race/ethnicity was
ÿ21.5 percent, while among non-Hispanic Blacks, Mexican
Americans, and other Hispanics, it was 2.9 percent (v2 test
of product term: p ¼ 0.007).
On the basis of our findings, if the association was causal,
we estimate that 32.2 percent (95 percent CI: 15.6, 45.2) of
cases of IDA and 13.6 percent (95 percent CI: 0, 26.3) of
cases of iron deficiency in the United States might be related
to H. pylori infection.
DISCUSSION
We found, in the most current cross-sectional data on the
US population (1999­2000), that on average H. pylori-
infected persons aged 3 years had a mean serum ferritin
deficit of 9 lg/liter. On the basis of quantitative phlebotomy
studies (17), this translates to a loss of 72­90 mg of storage
iron. We found a weak-to-moderate increase in prevalences
of iron deficiency and IDA among H. pylori-infected per-
sons in the US population. We also found a weaker increase
for anemia from other causes, suggesting that H. pylori
produces anemia by altering iron metabolism. Overall, our
data suggest that H. pylori may cause microbleeding and/or
affect iron uptake and thus deplete iron stores in persons
with iron deficiency and IDA, independently of ulcer dis-
ease. However, the associations between H. pylori infec-
tion and iron deficiency and IDA seem to be stronger
among persons with a history of peptic ulcer, suggesting
that ulcers may play a role in that small subpopulation.
We did not observe differences in iron deficiency/IDA

Iron Deficiency and H. pylori Infection 131

among uninfected persons with a history of peptic ulcer
disease. The pathogenesis of iron deficiency is likely to be
complex and possibly different in different age groups. For
example, in children, iron loss seems likely, whereas in
elderly persons with atrophic gastritis, low acid secretion
and reduced gastric juice ascorbic acid could result in im-
pairment of iron absorption.
One clinical trial of H. pylori eradication and/or iron sup-
plementation found an effect on anemia in the H. pylori
eradication treatment group that was comparable to the ef-
fect in persons who received only iron supplementation (18).
Our study controlled for several potential confounders of
the iron deficiency-H. pylori association. We found no ev-
idence of confounding by socioeconomic status using the
poverty income ratio. However, there might still have been
some degree of uncontrolled confounding by socioeco-
nomic status, since this measurement of poverty is based
on current income. Given that approximately one third of
our sample comprised children under 18 years of age, data
on occupation and education of the head of the household
could have provided a better measurement of socioeco-
nomic status but were not examined in this study. We were
able to control for major predictors of anemia in the United
States, such as age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
current pregnancy, gestational history, and kidney disease,
including those associated with major chronic diseases
such as diabetes and hypertension. The most important
confounder in these data was not socioeconomic status
but race/ethnicity. Differences in the H. pylori prevalence
odds ratios reported here deserve further investigation,
since African Americans seem to have lower hemoglobin
concentrations (19­21) after results are controlled for in-
come. That could also be the case for Mexican Americans.
This issue merits further research. Given the cross-
sectional nature of this study, caution should be taken
when interpreting the results, particularly since serology
may misclassify H. pylori infection status, as it measures
past status rather than current status. Data on the cytotoxin-
associated gene A (cagA) type of H. pylori infection
in the 1999­2000 NHANES was not available to the pub-
lic when we conducted this study. However, at least one
study found the association between IDA and H. pylori to
be unrelated to cagA type (19). We did not explore the
potential relations between infections with other agents
and iron deficiency, which could possibly have confounded
these results. These issues deserve further examination in
NHANES.
As Dubois and Kearney (3) have noted, most epidemio-
logic studies conducted so far have been cross-sectional.
Two of them, carried out in Denmark (22) and Germany
(23), were national health surveys targeting the adult pop-
ulation. These surveys found decreased levels of serum fer-
ritin among persons infected with H. pylori (22, 23). The
German survey also found a 16 percent decrease in levels of
serum ferritin among adults (23), while the Danish study
found associations among men and postmenopausal women
(22). Another large cross-sectional study conducted in
Alaska (24) found that H. pylori infection was associated
with decreasing levels of serum ferritin and that this asso-
ciation seemed stronger among adolescents and women of
childbearing age. Children and adolescents were also stud-
ied in population-based surveys in South Korea (25­27);
these studies found an association between H. pylori and
iron deficiency. A study conducted in Australia found an
association among women (28), and a cross-sectional study
conducted in New Zealand reported differences in serum
iron levels among men (29). A recent study of pregnant
women in Germany reported an association between current
H. pylori infection and hemoglobin levels (30). A recent
abstract on a cross-sectional study based on NHANES III
data also reported significant differences in serum ferritin
and iron deficiency and IDA by H. pylori infection status
that seemed to hold irrespective of cagA type (31), which
agrees with the results of the German study (23).
Besides being the most recent large national survey, the
1999­2000 NHANES provided data on children, adults,
and pregnant women and used validated indicators of the
prevalences of iron deficiency and IDA. NHANES collects

detailed information on study participants, which allowed us
to consider several potential confounders. Our findings are
consistent with those of previous studies that examined the
association between H. pylori infection and serum ferritin
level. It also adds information on the relations between in-
fection and the prevalences of IDA and anemia from other
causes.
IDA is a condition with important health consequences
regarding reproduction, immunity, work performance, and
possibly cognitive development (1). Thirty-five percent of
the cases of iron deficiency and 51 percent of the cases of
IDA in our study population involved H. pylori infection.
Significant fractions of the prevalences of iron deficiency
and IDA (14 percent and 32 percent, respectively) could
be related to H. pylori infection. The trend of decreasing
prevalences of iron deficiency and IDA from 1960 to 1980,
and its subsequent leveling off (6, 7), does not lead to
a straightforward interpretation of trends in H. pylori infec-
tion, since it was first measured in NHANES III. Moreover,
the prevalence of iron deficiency in our study was based on
fewer subjects than those of NHANES III, limiting the sta-
tistical power of comparisons of time trends for specific
high-risk groups. It is possible that the dramatic decline in
the prevalence of iron deficiency seen since the 1960s and
1970s was entirely due to public health interventions that
focused on iron supplementation and fortification. Achiev-
ing further declines might require addressing other causes
of iron deficiency, including infection, such as that from
H. pylori. The overall evidence is consistent with a continu-
ing decline in H. pylori infection, particularly in developed
countries. However, the available data on the prevalence of
H. pylori infection in the US population are consistent with
a slow decline. This may reflect the significant increase in
the number of foreign-born persons, particularly Mexican
Americans, who immigrated to the United States in the
1990s and now constitute the main reservoir of H. pylori
infection and related disease in the United States (32, 33).
Emerging evidence seems to place H. pylori infection next
to helminthiasis as a communicable cause of anemia (34).
Therefore, new initiatives designed to further decrease prev-
alences of iron deficiency and IDA in high-risk groups may
need to address the eradication of H. pylori infection, a class
A carcinogen that also causes peptic ulcer and gastritis.
