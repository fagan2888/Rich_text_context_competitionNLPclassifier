Abstract
Interest income is the most important source of revenue for most of the
banks. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of dierent interest rate
scenarios on the banks' interest income. As we do not know the interest rate
sensitivity of real banks, we construct for each bank a portfolio with a similar
composition of its assets and liabilities, called 'tracking bank'. We evaluate the
eect of 260 historical interest rate shocks on the tracking banks of German
savings banks and cooperative banks. It turns out that a sharp decrease in
the steepness of the yield curve has the most negative impact on the banks'
interest income.

2The banking crises in the US during the eighties and early nineties was in part due to interest
rate risk. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1997) more than 9% of all
banks in the US failed during this crisis.

5The results are often reported in the central banks' nancial stability reports; see for instance
Deutsche Bundesbank (2006), De Nederlandsche Bank (2006) and Oesterreichische Nationalbank
(2006).
6To our knowledge, we are the rst to model a bank's interest income in this way. Giebel et al.
(1999), pp. 65-85, use a similar approach to replicate the cash ows of non maturing deposits, for
instance savings accounts.

9Another possibility of constructing interest rate scenarios would be to analyze the dynamics
of the parameters that govern the yield curve (See Diebold and Li (2006)) instead of looking at
the entire yield curve. This approach would be especially relevant, in case one wanted to attach
probabilities to the scenarios.

that the average duration for savings accounts is assumed to be approximately three years. There
are, however, more sophisticated approaches to determine the interest rate risk of of non-maturity

the panel is unbalanced and the missing values induce some cross sectional variation, so that the
between R-squared is numerically dierent from zero.
