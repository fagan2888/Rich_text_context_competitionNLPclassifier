We develop a two-sided directed search model of relationship formation that can
be used to disentangle male and female preferences over partner characteris-
tics and over relationship terms from only a cross section of observed matches.
Individuals direct their search for a partner on the basis of (i) the terms of the
relationship, (ii) the partners' characteristics, and (iii) the endogenously deter-
mined probability of matching. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health, we estimate an equilibrium matching model of high school
relationships. Variation in gender ratios is used to uncover male and female
preferences. Estimates from the structural model match subjective responses on
whether sex would occur in one's ideal relationship. The estimates show that some
women would ideally not have sex, but do so out of matching concerns; the re-
verse is true for men. Counterfactual simulations show that the matching envi-
ronment black women face is the primary driver of the large differences in sexual
activity among white and black women.

1. Introduction
Next to drinking alcohol, sex is the most common risky behavior of teens.1 While numer-
ous studies try to measure the impact of policies or technological changes on the sexual
behaviors of teens2 and others try to measure the effect of sexual activities on educa-
tional and health outcomes,3 to our knowledge there are no economic studies of a fun-
damental trade-off faced by teens: the trade-off between being in a romantic relation-
ship at all and the inclusion of sex in a relationship. We model and estimate this trade-off
within the confines of the best available data on teen relationships and sexual behaviors.
We show that in equilibrium some women have sex out of matching concerns. Further,
as the gender ratio shifts to favor men, this effect becomes more pronounced.
To uncover differences in gender-specific preferences, we specify a model of two-
sided directed search. Utilities in a relationship depend on partner characteristics and
on the terms of the relationship. Individuals on one side of the market target their search
toward potential partners with particular characteristics and also target their search
based on the terms of the relationship (sex or no sex in our case).4 Given the supplies
of individuals on each side of the market, the ex ante yield from targeting particular
partner characteristics and terms depends on the associated probabilities of matching.
The probabilities of matching are in turn endogenously determined by the choices of
individuals on one's own side of the market (rivals) and by all individuals on the other
side (prospects). Changes in the supply of men and women of different characteristics
shift the equilibrium distribution of relationships.
The supply of men and women of different characteristics coupled with the directed
search model are what allow us to uncover differences in male and female preferences
for terms. In particular, we rely on the competitive behavior of men and women when
searching for a match. The main idea is that when men outnumber women, we tend to
observe relationships characterized by what women want and conversely if women out-
number men.5 Men and women target their search not only on the multidimensional
1The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
tracks the major risk taking behaviors of a national representative sample of 9th­12th graders. Summary
statistics for 2011 show that more teens have had sex (47%) than ever used marijuana (40%), other illicit
drugs, tobacco (44%), or attempted suicide. Only the behavior of ever having a drink of alcohol (71%) out-
ranked sex (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6104.pdf).

(2011) study emergency contraception availability and unprotected sex.
3See Sabia and Rees (2008, 2009).
4This formulation of characteristics and terms builds on work by Dagsvik (2000), who develops a theo-
retical matching model with terms where agents have preferences over terms and observed match charac-
teristics, and the preference distribution can in principle be backed out from observed aggregate matching
patterns. Willis (1999) also presents an equilibrium model where the terms are joint or single parenthood,
showing that sex ratio changes can generate equilibria where women raise children as single mothers.
5This fundamental idea has a long pedigree in the literature on intra-household allocations. McElroy and
Horney (1981) and McElroy (1990) pointed to the gender ratio in the remarriage market as one member of a
class of shifters (extra-environmental parameters (EEPs)) for the bargaining powers of spouses and thereby
intra-household allocations. Chiappori (1992) (and elsewhere) suggested using these same shifters to study
intra-household welfare.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 119
characteristics of the partner but also on the terms of the relationship.6 For example, a
man may choose to search for a woman of a specific race where the relationship would
include sex. With the terms of the relationship specified up front, utility is nontransfer-
able. The probability of successfully finding a match then depends on the number of
searchers on each side of the market. Searchers face a trade-off between having a low
probability of matching under their preferred relationship terms and a higher proba-
bility of matching under less-preferred terms. For a large class of constant elasticity of
substitution matching functions, we show that as the gender ratio becomes more unfa-
vorable, the individual becomes more likely to sacrifice relationship terms for a higher
match probability.
The advantages of our modeling approach are threefold. First, by linking choices
over partners with outcomes, in equilibrium we are able to weight the different gender
ratios appropriately. Standard practice is to use only one sex ratio when looking at the re-
lationships between gender ratios and outcomes. But the relevant gender ratios are de-
termined by equilibrium forces. Second, by allowing preferences over both partner char-
acteristics and what happens in the relationship, we are able to capture the trade-offs
made across the two when the matching environment changes. For example, increasing
the number of senior boys favors women. This may, however, still result in more sexual
relationships because the female preference for older partners may be stronger than the
preference for not having sex. Finally, by working in a nontransferable framework with
partner selection, we are able to identify individual-specific preferences for outcomes,
and not only joint gains from matching.7 In the transferable case, if the occurrence of
a particular outcome is affected by the gender ratio, it is unclear how utilities are af-
fected by the gender ratio because individuals may be making transfers not observed by
the researcher, particularly in the case when the outcomes of relevance are discrete and
two-sided (e.g., sex).
We estimate the model using data from the Add Health data. These data contain
information on the universe of students at particular U.S. high schools in 1995 as well
as answers to detailed questions about relationships for a subset of the students. The
model is estimated assuming that individuals are able to target their search toward
opposite-sex partners of a particular grade and race as well as to specify whether or not
sex will occur in the relationship.
Not surprisingly, estimates of the structural model show that men value sexual rela-
tionships relatively more than women. By simulating choices in the absence of matching
concerns, we find that 31 6% of women and 61 8% of men would prefer to be in a sex-
ual, as opposed to a nonsexual, relationship. These counterfactual choices bear a strik-
ing resemblance to subjective reports by students found in Add Health. There, 34 6% of
women and 58 3% of men responded that sex would be a part of their ideal relation-
6Recent empirical work by Dupuy and Galichon (2014) shows sorting in the marriage market is not uni-
dimensional and individuals trade-off heterogeneous characteristics differently.
7Both Hitsch, Hortacsu, and Ariely (2010) and Fisman, Iyengar, Kamenica, and Simonson (2006) use ob-
served choice and choice sets of both men and women to back out preferences for partner characteristics.
Fisman et al. (2006) observe choices in a speed-dating experiment and Hitsch, Hortacsu, and Ariely (2010)
observe them in an online-dating context. Chiappori, Oreffice, and Quintana-Domeque (2012) recover sep-
arate preferences for males and females for partner characteristics but not for relationship terms.
120 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)
ship. Hence, our structural model, while estimated on observed matches, is able to back
out preferences for sex that are remarkably close to the self-reports, providing some
credence to both the self-reported data and our structural estimates. These estimates
imply that matching concerns lead some women to have sex, not because they prefer
this, but because they are willing to trade off relationship terms for a higher probability
of matching.
We use the estimates of the structural model to understand racial differences in sex-
ual practices. Conditional on matching, the data reveal that black females are substan-
tially more likely to have sex than their white counterparts. We simulate changing the
market black females face so as to understand the sources of the racial gap. We do so in
two steps: first, examining the impact of blacks facing the same grade-specific gender
ratios as whites, and, second, the impact of facing the same distribution of sexually ex-
perienced teens in the school. While changing the gender ratios has a substantial impact
on match probabilities, their effect on the probability of sex conditional on matching is
small. The primary driver behind differences in sex behavior between white women and
black women is the strong preferences for own-race matches coupled with black males
being substantially more sexually experienced than white males.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section lays out a two-sided
model of targeted search and matching, relates the matching function to special cases
found in the literature, establishes the existence of equilibrium, and shows how the gen-
der ratio affects the probability of matching. Section 3 presents the Add Health data on
high school relationships. Section 4 describes the maximum likelihood estimator. Sec-
tion 5 presents the resulting estimates and shows how the structural model can back
out preferences in the absence of competitive effects, demonstrating how the model
matches self-reported preferences on a number of dimensions. We also show the ro-
bustness of our results to different assumptions regarding searching outside the school
as well as choosing not to search. Section 6 gives the counterfactuals. Section 7 of-
fers an exploration of what our results imply about female welfare beyond the teen sex
setting. Replication files are available in a supplementary file on the journal website,

2. Model
We analyze the trade-offs among three sources of expected utility from searching for a
partner: the type of partner (race, grade), the terms of the relationship (sex/no sex), and
the probability of success (matching). Individuals know in advance their payoffs from
different partner types and relationship terms, and they may target less-preferred com-
binations of types and terms so as to have higher probabilities of matching. At its core,
our model embeds search and the attendant risk of not matching into a static model.
To disentangle male and female preferences, we propose a two-sided search model
with nontransferable utility and consider only opposite-sex, one-to-one matching. We
categorize each male as a type m, where m  {1 2 M}. Similarly, each woman is given
a type w, where w  {1 2 W }. An individual's type can denote some collection of
observed characteristics such as age, grade, race, or attractiveness. For males (females)
there are then W (M) types of mates. Let im indicate the ith member of type m.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 121
We index the possible terms of the relationship by r  {1 R}.8 We model search
as being completely directed: men and women are able to target their search on both the
characteristics of the partner as well as the terms of the relationship. Each man (woman)
then makes a discrete choice to search in one of M × R (W × R) markets, resulting in
M × W × R types of matches.
Search is then modeled as a one-shot game: there are no dynamics in the model.
Individuals first decide in which market to search. Couples are matched with the proba-
bilities of matching depending on the number of searchers on both sides of the market.
2.1 Individuals
An individual's expected utility for searching in a particular market depends on three
factors:
1. The probability of matching in the market where the probability of an m-type
man matching with a w-type woman with relationship terms r is Pwr
m
.
2. A deterministic portion of utility conditional on matching given by wr
m
for an m-
type man.
3. An individual-specific preference term wr
im
.9
Note that the only individual-specific part of expected utility is wr
im
and that it is known to
the individual before making his/her search decision. Hence, there is no match-specific
component beyond what occurs through the observed characteristics of the partner and
the terms of the relationship. We treat wr
im
as private information implying search deci-
sions are based on the distribution of the unobserved preferences of the other students
in the school, not their realizations. Finally, note that the probability of matching is only
affected by male and female type and relationship terms: all males of type m searching
in the {w r} market have the same probability of matching.
We normalize the utility of not matching to zero. Expected utility from searching
in a particular market is then the probability of matching in the market times the utility
conditional on matching. We specify the functional form of the utility such that expected
utility for an m-type man searching for a w-type woman on relationship terms r is

2.2 Matching
We now specify the matching process. The matching process is essentially a production
function, taking as inputs the number of searching men and the number of searching
women in each market and giving the number of matches in each market as an output.
We parameterize the number of matches in market {m w r}, Xmwr, as depending on
the number of m-type men and w-type women searching in the market. Let Nm and Nw
indicate the number of m-type men and the number of w-type women overall. Recall
that wr
m
and mr
w
give the probabilities, or shares, of m-type men and w-type women
searching in market {m w r}. Thus wr
m
Nm is the number of men of type m searching for
women of type w with relationship terms r. The number of matches in market {m w r}
is then given by10

where  determines the elasticity of substitution (given by (1/(1 - ))), and A measures

comes Cobb­Douglas, and as   -, the CES function becomes Leontief. Note that
Xmwr = Xwmr for all m, w, and r.

is less than both the number of men and the number of women in the {m w r} market. In practice, we nest
the CES matching function into a Leontief function to constrain the number of matches to be less than the
number of searching men and women:

The log of this term then enters into the multinomial logit probabilities of searching in
particular markets and it captures the influence of the gender ratio on search decisions.

The 's give the probabilities of searching in particular markets. But these 's also affect
the probabilities of matching, the P's. We rewrite equation (3) to make the dependence

Since the market shares must sum to 1 for both men and women, equilibrium in our
model is characterized by stacking the (MR - 1) and (W R - 1) shares and solving for
the fixed point. Since  is a continuous mapping on a compact, convex space, Brouwer's
fixed point theorem guarantees that an equilibrium exists. As in macro models of the
labor market, there is only one equilibrium where the search probabilities are positive
in all markets. Diamond (1982) shows that a necessary condition for multiple equilib-
ria (with positive search probabilities) in a similar model (with endogenous search on
both sides of the labor market) is increasing returns to scale in the matching technology.
There are other equilibria that result from coordination failures where certain markets
are empty. We assume that the equilibrium being played is the one where search prob-
abilities are positive in all markets. For example, if there is one 9th-grade white female,
every male searching for her type believes he could match with her according to the
(positive) match and search probabilities outlined above.
2.4 Implications of changing the gender ratio
Given our utility specification and matching process, we now turn to how changing the
gender ratio leads to changes in the probabilities of choosing particular markets. To be-
gin, consider two markets that include w-type women and m-type men but where the
relationship terms in the two markets are given by r and r , respectively. Now, fix the
search probabilities, the 's, and increase the number of m-type men. We can then see
which of the two types of relationships becomes relatively more attractive for men and
women, respectively. We then show how the search probabilities must adjust in equilib-
rium.
Denoting Gm
w
as the ratio Nm/Nw, Proposition 1 shows the relationship between the
gender ratio and search behavior. The proof is given in Appendix A.
Proposition 1. If  < 0 and mr
w
- mr
w
> wr
m
- wr
m
, then the following relationships
hold:
(a) We have mr

124 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)

(c) Both mr

In Proposition 1 the average preference of a {m w} pair is such that the women in
the pair have a stronger preference for terms r over r than their male counterparts. The
first two claims are intuitive. Claim (a) states that this relative preference by women for
r over r translates into search behavior: in equilibrium, the ratio of search probabilities
for r versus r must result in women searching relatively more in r than men. These
differential search probabilities then translate into different match probabilities. Since
women are relatively more likely than men to search in r , female match probabilities
must be lower in r than in r, with the reverse holding for men, claim (b).
The key result for our empirical work is claim (c). As the gender ratio moves such
that men become relatively more abundant, both men and women increase their rela-
tive search probabilities in the market where women have a relative preference, in this
case r . The result falls directly out of the elasticity of substitution. Namely, for elasticities
of substitution less than 1 ( < 0), the lack of substitutability between men and women
in the market implies that as Gm
w
increases, larger changes in match probabilities for
men (women) will occur where men are relatively more (less) abundant. The elasticity
of the probability of matching with respect to Gm
w
for men and women in the {m w r}
market conditional on  are given by

With  < 0, as the ratio of male to female search probabilities (wr
m
/mr
w
) increases, the
magnitude of the elasticity falls for females and rises for males. With fixed search prob-
abilities, increasing the number of men relative to women makes the market where
women have a relative preference more attractive for both sexes, resulting in shifts by
both men and women to that market in equilibrium.
To illustrate this point, consider the Leontief case where  moves toward negative
infinity ((1/(1 - ))  0). The matching function is given by
Xmwr = Amin wr
m
Nm mr

Nw
The number of matches is determined by whichever side of the market has fewer
searchers. Hence, changes in the gender ratio have extreme effects on the group that
is in the majority in a particular market, with no effect on the group in the minority.11
11On the other extreme is the Cobb­Douglas case where   0, implying the elasticity of substitution,
(1/(1 - )), is 1. Hence, if gender ratios do affect relationship terms, then this is evidence that the matching
function is not Cobb­Douglas.

2.5 Prior work on matching and our model
Different models serve different purposes. By incorporating directed search into a
matching model, we provide a static framework in which the preferences for terms are
identified and the match-specific endogenous gender ratios reveal the rates at which
individuals on both sides will substitute across (i) the terms of a relationship, (ii) the
characteristics of one's partner, and (iii) the probability of matching at all. This approach
expands the set of questions researchers can answer since the predominant search and
matching models have difficulty investigating this three-way trade-off, for different rea-
sons.
On the one hand, two-sided frictionless matching (assignment) models provide a
flexible way to identify the gains to relationships for pairs across the partner charac-
teristic distribution. However, these models are restrictive in how the changes in the
sex ratio affect the distribution of matches; this is the unexpected symmetry result of
Decker, Lieb, McCann, and Stephens (2013).12 They also do not permit identification of
preferences for match-specific terms such as sex.13 Although individuals may trade off
sex for other characteristics (in our model they trade off sex for partner characteristics
and the probability of any match at all), sex is not a transfer because it is non-rival. One
cannot "give up sex" so the other party can have sex without oneself having sex. This
symmetry (with one-to-one matching the number of men and women in current sex-
ual matches must be equal) means it is not possible to back out male-as-distinct-from-
female preferences from one market. The same problem exists for other symmetric out-
comes, like marriage or childbearing.14 The key parameters we identify with data from
multiple markets are (i) preferences for terms and (ii) matching technology parameters.
In our model, uncertainty about matching serves to coordinate agents' decisions and,
therefore, to clear the market, instead of transferring utility. In most transferable util-
ity models, transfers are symmetric, but in our search model the "transfer" is essentially
the negative utility associated with possibly not matching, which is always bigger for
the group in the majority. Thus our Proposition 1 shows that the benefits from a change
in the gender ratio are not equally distributed across sides of the market. This distinc-
tion prevents the transfers from canceling out and decentralizing the two-sided problem
into two sets of one-sided problems (as in Galichon and Salanié (2014)). In our frame-
work utility is lost due to uncertainty from search frictions rather than being delivered
to the other side of the market.
12This is particularly restrictive in the context of relationship terms as the outside option in these
models--being single--is the same for those who choose sex and those who do not. Consider the Choo
and Siow (2006) setup where the number of m-type men equals the number of w-type women. Differentiat-
ing Xmwr with respect to the number of m-type men produces the same change in the number of matches
as differentiating with respect to the number of w-type women, implying no shift in relationship terms.
13If transfers were observed, these models could identify pre-transfer utilities over characteristics. Choo
and Siow (2006) introduced this framework and Galichon and Salanié (2014) studied identification of the
systematic gains to marriage when relaxing assumptions about unobserved preferences and the observ-
ability of transfers.
14While in reality there may be both relationship terms and transfers, trying to identify both from the
match distribution is beyond the scope of this paper.
126 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)
On the other hand, while dynamic search models can both endogenize the sex ratio
and help to explain the time profile of matching across characteristics, current com-
putational considerations severely limit the number of individual-level characteristics
included in empirical work.15 For example Richards-Shubik (2014) models a very simi-
lar process to ours--the dynamics of sexual initiation--but it is precisely the complica-
tion of the dynamic process that leads him to aggregate across partner characteristics.
Bronson and Mazzocco (2013) model the dynamics of changes in cohort size, which
implicitly changes the gender ratio of young women to older men, leading to fewer
marriages. But here too the types of partners are limited and differences in preferences
across genders are not recovered. Hence our model complements existing search mod-
els by incorporating how the gender ratio forces trade-offs, but relaxing the computa-
tional burden to allow for many dimensions. In terms of market clearing, in dynamic
models this arises through the optimal marriage delay of agents given expectations
about future utility, whereas we coordinate decisions through the current probability
of matching.
3. Data and descriptive characteristics
We now describe the data used to estimate the model. We use data from wave I of the Na-
tional Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health.16 The data include an in-school survey
of almost 90,000 7th­12th-grade students at a randomly sampled set of 80 communities
across the United States.17 Attempts were made to have as many students as possible
from each school fill out the survey during a school day. Questions consist mainly of
individual data like age, race, and grade, with limited information on academics, ex-
tracurricular activities, and risky behavior. We use this sample to construct school level
aggregates across observable characteristics such as grade and race by gender.
The Add Health data also include a random sample of students who were adminis-
tered a more detailed in-home survey. The in-home sample includes detailed relation-
ship histories and sexual behaviors. The relationship histories include both what hap-
pens within the relationships as well as characteristics of the partner. A natural problem
in this survey design is the issue of what constitutes a relationship, particularly when
men and women may define relationships differently. We define a relationship as con-
sisting of both (i) holding hands and (ii) kissing. This definition results in the most sym-
metric distribution of responses within schools.18
15Bronson and Mazzocco (2013) and Beauchamp, Sanzenbacher, Seitz, and Skira (2014) both model the
equilibrium distribution of singles (and therefore matching probabilities) across time. For other examples
of dynamic search and matching models, see Brien, Lillard, and Stern (2006), Ge (2011), Gemici and Laufer
(2011), Rasul (2006), Richards-Shubik (2014), and Wong (2003a, 2003b).
16The survey of adolescents in the United States was organized through the Carolina Population Center
and data were collected in four waves: 1994­1995, 1995­1996, 2001­2002, and 2008.
17A school pair, consisting of a high school and a randomly selected feeder school (middle school or
junior high school from the same district) were taken from each community.
18Applying this definition, 48 8% of ongoing in-school relationships in the in-home sample came from
women and 51 2% from men. With perfect reporting, and assuming that the in-home sample is represen-
tative on gender, we would expect parity.

The Add Health data are nationally representative at the school level and so are
drawn from all types of schools. We restrict attention to schools that enroll both men
and women and focus on respondents who are in the 9th­12th grades.19 We drop one all
boys school, one vocational education school for high school dropouts, and six schools
without meaningful numbers of 9th graders.20 Since the focus here will be on a cross
section of the matching distribution, we count only current relationships among part-
ners who attend the same school.21 Those matched with someone outside of the school
are initially dropped. This is consistent with assuming the outside matching market is
frictionless, which we relax in Section 5.3.22
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the sample. Roughly 30% of the sample are
currently in a relationship and roughly half of these involve sex. Included in the descrip-

Note: Sample includes only those searching in school, un-
der the assumption that Pout

= 1. Current is defined as ongo-
ing at the time of the in-home survey. Relationship means hold-
ing hands and kissing; sex refers to sexual intercourse.
19The in-home sample is drawn from schools with different grades: 73% of schools have grades 9­12,
11% have grades 7­12, and 13% had other combinations of grades (e.g., K­12). Finally 1 4% are drawn from
a junior and senior high school that are distinct schools.
20These schools on average had around 300 students in each of the grades 10­12, but on average 9 stu-
dents in the 9th grade. The Add Health sampling design only probabilistically included the most relevant
junior high or middle school for a high school; the relevant 9th grade observations for these six schools were
not sampled, but rather a small "feeder" school. Schools for whom we observe fewer than 10 students in the
detailed interviews are also dropped.
21A sample of ongoing relationships showed 55% of partners met in the same school; the next closest
avenue of matching was mutual friends, accounting for only 24% of matches.
22From 14,840 students between grades 9 and 12, we drop schools discussed above (2622), schools with
fewer than 10 reported students (146), unweighted data (996), missing data (106), and those matching out-
side the school (3771), giving 7141 valid observations for in-school searchers.

tive statistics is whether the individual has had sex prior to their current relationship.23
Men report significantly higher rates of prior sex than women. Black men and women
have had sex more than whites, but the gender gap in past sex is larger for blacks.
In theory, men and women should report roughly the same number of relationships
but in practice this is not the case. Given that we observe double reporting in these data,
that is, men are asked to report their matches within a school and so are women, we can
see these differences. Men reported 688 matches where sex occurred and 561 matches
where sex did not occur, while women reported 551 matches with sex and 532 matches
without sex. Unfortunately we cannot link individuals to their partners within the sam-
ple, meaning incorporating both sets of reports would double count an unknown subset
of matches. To deal with both double counting and misreporting we use information
about matches reported by women. This also ensures that our estimated results on dif-
ferences in male and female preferences for sex are not driven by differences in self-
reporting.
3.1 Direct measures of preferences
Some direct information on gender differences in preferences for sex can be found from
questions that were asked in the in-home sample. Individuals were asked about whether
they would want a romantic relationship over the next year and what physical events
would occur between the partners. Included in the questions were whether the ideal
relationship would involve having sex. Table 2 shows elicited preferences over sex and

Note: Answers come from questions on whether the respon-
dents' ideal relationship over the coming year would include sex
or a relationship as defined above.
23This variable was created from reports of the full relationship history and takes on a value of 1 if the
person has had sex in the past with someone besides his/her current partner. Arcidiacono, Khwaja, and
Ouyang (2012) provide evidence that once adolescent females become sexually active, they generally re-
main so.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 129
relationships overall as well as by grade and race. Comparing Table 1 to Table 2, more
individuals prefer having relationships than do, suggesting significant search frictions.
While preferences for relationships are the same for both men and women (over 95%
want a relationship as defined), preferences for sex are not. While 60% of men would
prefer to have sex, the fraction of women who prefer to have sex is only 36%. Preferences
for sex rise with age for both males and females. Even so, comparing sex preferences of
women in a particular grade with the sex preferences of men in any other grade shows
stronger male preferences for sex: even 9th-grade men have stronger preferences for sex
than 12th-grade women. Note from Table 1 that half of current relationships entail sex,
which is higher than the self-reported preferences for women averaged over any grade,
even conditional on wanting a relationship. This suggests the possibility that women
may be sacrificing what they want so as to form relationships.
To investigate this further, Table 3 shows the probability of having sex conditional
on whether the respondent's ideal relationship includes sex. The means are presented
separately for men and women, showing that women who want to have sex are signif-
icantly more likely to have sex than men who want to have sex. Further, women who
do not want to have sex are also significantly more likely to have sex than men who do
not want to have sex. The second row shows that these male/female differences hold
conditional on being matched: it is not just that women who want sex sort into relation-
ships at a higher rate; they also see their preferences implemented within matches more
frequently than similar men. In contrast, women who do not want to have sex see their
preferences implemented within matches less frequently than similar men. Finally, we
also condition on having had sex in past. Here we see that women who have not previ-
ously had sex but want to are 12 percentage points more likely to have sex than similar

men conditional on being matched, again illustrating that women have an easier time
finding sexual partners while men have an easier time finding nonsexual partners.
3.2 The distribution of matches
Whether sacrifices over the terms of the relationship are made may in part be dictated
by the characteristics of the partner. Individuals may be willing to take more undesirable
relationship terms when the partner is more desirable. We now turn to characteristics of
the partner, focusing in particular on grade and race. Table 4 shows the share of relation-
ships for each possible male/female grade combination. The most common matches
are among individuals in the same grade, making up over 40% of all matches. The six
combinations of an older man with a younger woman also make up a large fraction of
observations at over 40%, leaving less than 20% of matches for women with younger
men. While matched women are evenly distributed across grades, older men are sub-
stantially more likely to be matched than younger men. Even though 9th-grade men
outnumber 12th-grade men by almost three to two, there are 2 5 times more matched
12th-grade men than 9th-grade men.24 These results point toward younger women and
older men being more desirable and hence they may have more control over the terms
of the relationship.
Table 5 shows the patterns of cross-racial matching. As can be seen from the diagonal
elements of the table, the vast majority of matches--over 85%--are same-race matches.
In the set of minorities, Hispanic students date outside their race/ethnicity most often,
followed by those in the other category (who are predominantly Asian), and then blacks.
Hispanic and black men see much higher probabilities of matching with other races
than their female counterparts while the reverse is true for whites and those in the other
category.25

school) where we assume the rates of matching outside the school are the same in the in-home sample as
in the in-school sample.

in interracial dating: Lee and Edmonston (2005) offer many descriptives using U.S. Census data to track

3.3 The gender ratio and its implications for relationship terms
Given evidence that certain characteristics influence whether one's preferences will
align with what happens in a relationship, the supply of these characteristics may also
have an effect on the terms of the relationship. For example, when men are in short sup-
ply, women may need to sacrifice their preferences more so as to successfully match. We
examine how gender ratios vary across schools in Table 6, paying particular attention to
the gender ratios for whites and blacks by grade. Each cell in Table 6 gives the ratio of
female to male students for each grade­race pairing.26 Table 6 shows that there is a sub-
stantial amount of variation in the gender ratio, particularly among blacks.27 Breaking
out the gender ratio along different dimensions (race and grade­race groupings) spreads
the initially condensed distribution.28
The bottom panel of Table 6 shows the probability of having sex conditional on
matching at schools where the fraction of females is above the 75th percentile or below
the 25th percentile. The first two rows show the cases when the gender ratio is mea-
sured using the whole school and then using only those of the same race. In both cases,
a higher fraction of females is associated with more sex, though the differences are not
large. The evidence in Section 3.2 showed that the most common matches are between
those of the same race and grade so we next consider the percent female of the same
grade­race pair as the partner. For a woman matching with a 12th-grade white male,
this variable is the ratio of females to males among 12th-grade whites. Given the high
likelihood of individuals matching in their own grade­race pair, this variable serves as a
interracial marriage over the last 40 years. The census shows a clear pattern with black men and Asian
women marrying outside their race far more than black women and Asian men. Qian (1997) reports that
white men marry most frequently whites, then Asians, Hispanics, and blacks.
26A minimum of five observations from the race or grade­race pair is required for a school to enter Ta-
ble 6. Note that the gender ratio favors women here due to those matching outside the school being re-
moved and women, particularly older women, being more likely to match outside the school.
27This dispersion is even more pronounced for Hispanic and other-race students in part due to smaller
sample sizes.
28The populations have been scaled down by 1 minus the estimated conditional probability of matching
outside the school for each age­race­gender­school group.

crude measure of the outside options the partner faces. The final row of Table 6 shows
that if the fraction of females in the partner's race­grade cell is higher, the probability of
sex in the relationship is more likely: when women face more competition for partners,
more sex results.
To further investigate the role of competition in determining relationship terms, Ta-
ble 7 presents marginal effects from a probit of whether females in relationships had sex.
We again use the ratio of females to males in the partner's grade­race cell as this gives
us our best reduced form measure of the partner's outside options. The results from the
reduced form are clear: increases in the outside options for male partners is associated
with a higher probability of having sex. The second column indicates these results are
strengthened when we control for school fixed effects. Increasing partner grade also af-
fects the probability of having sex, even conditional on own grade and prior sex. Since
older men appear to be more desirable for women, this suggests women are willing to
give on their preferred relationship terms so as to match with a more preferred partner.
Note that the estimates in Table 7 do not account for the fact that the grade­race
pair individuals matched with resulted from a choice to search in that market. The struc-
tural model outlined above specifically accounts for the endogeneity associated with the
choice of partner characteristics.

and  denote significance at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively.
4. Estimation
Having discussed the trends in the data and the modeling approach, we now turn to in-
tegrating the data and the model for estimation. Types of men and women are defined
at the grade­race level as suggested by the clear differences in matching patterns across
race and grade. We classify relationships as one of two types: those that entail sex and
those that do not. An individual is defined as being in a relationship without sex if the
person meets the standards described previously (holding hands, etc.). An individual is
classified as having a relationship with sex if the individual is having sexual intercourse
in his/her current match, regardless of his/her relationship status. With 2 types of rela-
tionships, 4 grades, and 4 races, there are then 32 markets.
The next two subsections put structure on the utility function and show how to form
the likelihood function given the constraints posed by the data. However, there are three
additional issues that arise from our data: (i) the unobserved fraction of each type who
searched outside the school,29 (ii) the unobserved distribution of past sex among men,
and (iii) unreported partner characteristics. We discuss how we deal with each of these
issues in Appendix B.
29From the in-home sample, we know who is matched outside of the school. We then project the share
of individuals in the whole school who match in the outside market. See Appendix B for how this is done.
We then scale down the number of within-school searchers by the number of students who are predicted to
match outside the school. As we discuss in Section 5.3, this is consistent with either (i) individuals matching
in the outside market in a first stage or (ii) the probability of matching in the outside market being 1.
134 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)
4.1 Utility
Rather than having separate 's (utilities) for every type of relationship, we put some
structure on the utility function. Denote the grade associated with an m-type man as
Gm  {1 2 3 4}. When a man searches for a w-type woman, the grade of the partner is
PGw. Similarly, Rm  {1 2 3 4} gives the race of an m-type man with the corresponding
race of the potential w-type partner given by PGw. We specify the utility of a nonsexual
relationship as a function of the partner's grade and race as well as whether the partner
is in the same grade as the searching individual, SGmw = I(Gm = PGw) where I is the
indicator function, and the same race, SRmw = I(Rm = PRw).
Denoting searching in the no-sex market by r = 1, we formulate the deterministic
part of utility for men and women matching in the no-sex market as
mw1
= 1SGmw + 2PGw + 3SRmw +
4
j=1
I(PRw = j)4j (7)
wm1
= 1SGmw + 5PGm + 3SRmw +
4
j=1
I(PRm = j)6j (8)
where the intercept of a nonsexual relationship is normalized to 0. To economize on
parameters, this specification sets the extra utility associated with being in the same
grade or being of the same race to be the same for men and women. The effect of part-
ner grade and race, however, is allowed to vary by gender. The specification allows cer-
tain race­gender combinations to be more desirable than other race­gender combina-
tions.
The utility of sexual relationships takes the utility of nonsexual relationships and
adds an intercept that differs depending on whether the individual has had sex in the
past, PSiw. Note that we are not specifying that partners have preferences for individuals
who have had sex in the past but rather those who have had sex in the past have prefer-
ences for sex now. Hence, the types m and w do not include past sex, and it is therefore
not targeted. We also include a grade profile that captures the transition process into
sexual activity (e.g., social, biological, and other factors changing as adolescents age).
Denoting searching in the sex market by r = 2, we specify the deterministic part of util-
ity for men and women matching in the sex market as30
mw2(PSim) = mw1
+ 7 + 8PSim + 12Gm (9)
wm2(PSiw) = wm1
+ 11
+ 8PSiw + 13Gw (10)
4.2 Forming the likelihood function
We do not observe all matches but only those in the in-home sample. However, we do
observe gender, grade, and race for the population of students at each school. As de-
30Although men an women may differ in their preferences for sex, the effect of past sex is constrained to
be the same for men and women. Allowing coefficients for past sex to vary by gender generates a problem
with identification since we must integrate out over the probability that each male has had sex in the past
because it is unobserved from female reporting.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 135
scribed in more detail in Appendix B, by inferring population moments of past sex from
the in-home sample, we can construct the choice probabilities for the entire school from
the in-home sample. We take the relationships as defined by the women in the Add
Health. Since women report their partner characteristics, we only require a sample of
women (matched and unmatched) along with the aggregate type distributions of men
and women to estimate our model.
The parameters that need to be estimated include those of the utility function and
the parameters of the matching function,  and A. Denote  as the set {  A }. De-
note Nkr
j ps
as the equilibrium number of searching j types with past sex ps who are
searching for k types on relationship terms r. Let N denote the vector of the number
of each type searching in each market with elements given by Nkr
j ps
. Hence, N contains
64 elements where each element refers to a gender, grade, race, and past-sex combina-
tion. The male search probabilities enter the female respondent likelihood through N.
Denote yiw = 1 if the ith woman of type w was in a current relationship at the time of
the survey and is 0 otherwise. The woman is then considered matched if yiw = 1. The
woman's search decision, diw, is observed only if the woman was matched. Hence, we
need to integrate out over the search decision for those who are not matched. The log
likelihood for the ith woman of type w is then given by

Note that the probability of matching is not affected by past sex except through the
search probabilities. Note also that the  terms are the equilibrium probabilities of
searching in each market for each type, and are thus functions of [Pmr

The likelihood described so far was for a generic school. Denote the schools in the
data by s  {1 S}. Summing the log likelihoods over all the possible female types at

5. Results
The estimates of the structural model are presented in Table 8. Key to disentangling male
and female preferences given observed matches is the effect of the different gender ra-
tios on the search decisions. These gender ratios manifest themselves through their ef-
fect on the probability of matching. The parameters of the matching function,  and
A, are identified through variation in matches across schools with different gender ra-
tios and the overall match rate.31 The estimates of  are significant and negative, ruling
out the Cobb­Douglas matching model and confirming that gender ratios do affect the
likelihood of observing particular matches.
Focusing our attention on the first column, the middle panel of Table 8 shows how
sex is valued above and beyond the relationship itself. Consistent with the elicited pref-
erences in Table 2, males on average have stronger preferences for sex than females.
Those who have had sex in the past also have a much stronger preference for sex in the
present. As adolescents age their utility from sex increases and this is particularly true
for women.
The lower panel shows how partner characteristics affect the value of a relationship.
Here we see that women prefer to be matched with older men and that men have a
slight preference for younger women. Individuals also prefer to be matched with those
in the same grade and with those of the same race. The relative preferences for males
and females of particular races match those in the prior literature. For example, black
men are more preferred by members of other races than black women.
Our preferred model is presented in column (i). In subsequent columns we present
alternative models. Column (ii) only allows for gender differences in preferences for sex
(thus model (i) nests model (ii)). Column (iii) includes a set of partner race­grade, part-
ner race­partner grade, and partner race­past-sex interactions in addition to the pa-
rameters in column (i) (thus model (iii) nests model (i)).32 Although the utility estimates
look different between (i) and (ii) this stems from the utility parameters being scaled
by a different . Judging solely by likelihood ratio tests, model (i) outperforms model
(ii) and model (iii) outperforms our preferred model (i). However, model (iii)'s poor per-
formance in matching stated preferences for sex (discussed in the next section) sug-
gests that the model is overparameterized. In column (iv), we allow the distributions of
the unobserved utility draws to differ by whether individuals have had sex in the past.
The mean of the distribution is already shifted by inclusion of the past-sex indicator,
so model (iv) only adds one parameter to our baseline model: a separate variance for
31In a two-market model with only male and female preferences for sex,  and A, the four parame-
ters are not identified from only one school. That is, because within a school we observe three moments:
(i) the overall gender ratio, (ii) the ratio of men who have sex relative to men who do not have sex (which
equals that same ratio for women without sampling error), and (iii) the number of men unmatched (only
the number of unmatched men or unmatched women is independent since we are counting the gender
ratio overall). Thus the search friction A is identified by including multiple schools. See Hsieh (2012) for
recent work on identification in models with different male and female preferences within a single market.
32Model (iii) includes three partner races, two gender, and three other characteristics (linear grade, linear
partner grade, and past sex), and so has 18 (= 3 × 3 × 2) more parameters than model (i).

the errors of individuals with past sex equal to 1. Based on the log likelihoods we can-
not reject that the variance is the same across the two groups, and so we proceed with
model (i).
5.1 Model fitness
Between the general equilibrium effects and the nonlinear nature of the specification,
the magnitudes of the utility coefficients are difficult to interpret. However, we can use
the coefficient estimates to back out the fraction of men and women who prefer sex to no
sex absent concerns about matching. Namely, we can turn off the effects of the proba-
bility of matching and see what choices would have been made in the absence of having
to compete for partners. We can then compare these model estimated preferences to the
stated preferences discussed in Table 2. As the stated preferences were never used in the
estimation, this constitutes an out-of-estimation-sample comparison; an agreement of
the estimated and stated preferences can provide compelling evidence for the credibil-
ity of the underlying parameter estimates. We also examine the within-sample fit of our
baseline model (i) and the extended model (iii) from Table 8.
The first three data columns of Table 9 show that the baseline model does a good job
of matching the elicited preferences for sex, which we report in two ways: conditional
(C) on wanting a match and unconditional (U). The elicited preferences show 34­36% of
women prefer sex compared to 31 6% of women predicted by the model, while for men
the elicited preference for sex is between 58% and 60% compared to a model prediction
of 61 8%. The model predictions and self-reports both show a higher preference for sex
among blacks relative to whites. Each race­gender cell shows agreement between the
subjective probabilities and the modeled-predicted probabilities with the exception of
Hispanic females. Preferences for sex by grade match well for men but the grade profile
is too steep for women. The fourth data column shows the problem with the extended
model. Namely, it does not do as well at matching the self-reported preferences of males:
overall, across races, and for younger males.
The final three columns of Table 9 compare the observed frequencies of sexual re-
lationships with the equilibrium predicted probabilities (i.e., the probability of search
times the probability of matching). Both the extended and baseline models provide a
reasonable fit to the underlying data, especially for females, with very little difference in
the within-sample predictions between the two models.
Finally, our model gives predictions about the evolution of sexual histories. Here we
use our model to forecast the distribution of individuals by grade and race who will en-
ter the subsequent grade with sexual experience.33 We present these model forecasts in
Table 10. The model does an excellent job forecasting the 1-year evolution in sexual ex-
perience for white men and white women. For Hispanic females and black males and
33The fraction who have had sex in each grade (10­12) is the sum of (i) the fraction who had sex in the
prior grade plus (ii) the fraction who had not had sex times the probability of searching and matching. Note
that our calculations miss those who had sex outside of the school and then chose to search in the school
in the next period as well as those who had sex in an in-school match but chose to search outside of the
school in the next period.

Note: The male observed probabilities are obtained by ignoring male reporting of sex and adding female reports to the
number of men who did not report sex. Stated and observed preference means come from a sample of both men (N = 3423)
and women (N = 3449). The Baseline and Extended columns set the probability of matching to 1, and report the average choice
probability across individuals based only on preference parameters. The predicted probability of sex means are the product of
search and matching probabilities at the equilibrium.
females, the predictions of the model suggest a much more rapid rise in the rates of sex-
ual activity than what is actually seen in the data. A potential reason for the poor fit for
blacks is differences in high school dropout rates. Namely, the evolution we predict as-
sumes that the same students would be present a year from now. To the extent that those
who drop out are more likely to engage in sex or, in the case of females, drop out because
of a pregnancy, it is not surprising that our predictions regarding the fraction entering
the next year having had sex is too high.
5.2 Equilibrium match probabilities
Table 11 presents the estimated equilibrium match probabilities for whites in same-race
markets. The table is partitioned into 16 cells, one for each possible female grade­male
grade match. The columns within each cell report the probabilities of matching for men
(Pw
m
) and women (Pm
w
). The first column gives the probabilities that a 9th-grade male
matches in his eight possible markets (sex or no-sex market with women in four grades).

Note: Each cell gives the probability of matching in sex or no-sex markets based on an individual's grade and possible
partner grade. The term Pw
m is the probability of matching for a man looking for a woman; Pm
w is the probability of matching
for a woman looking for a man.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 141
The four columns headed by Pm
w
in the first row give the comparable eight probabilities
for 9th-grade women.
The grade-matching patterns are driven by the equilibrium combination of utility
parameters and the probability of matching. As expected, 9th-grade males--in both the
sex and the no-sex markets--see the lowest match probabilities of any group. Indeed,
females can always match with a 9th-grade male in the sex market. For females, the
probability of matching declines with partner grade because of a female preference for
older men. But the rate at which female match probabilities decline with partner grade
is such that the declines are particularly large in the no-sex market. With older men in
relatively scarce supply, women must be willing to search in the sex market for a reason-
able chance of matching with these men.
5.3 Robustness checks
We now relax assumptions on who searches outside the school and whether all indi-
viduals search, showing that our estimated differences in preferences between males
and females are robust to alternative assumptions. Previously we removed individuals
matched with someone outside of the school. This assumption is consistent with either
(a) individuals searching and matching in the outside market in a first stage or (b) the
probability of matching being 1 in the outside market. To see (b), note that only those
who matched in the outside market will have searched in the outside market. Denote
o as the outside market. The probability of an m-type man searching in the {m w r}
market is
Pr(w r|m) =
exp
wr
m
+ ln Pwr
m

w r
exp

+ ln Pw r

(12)
Using the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property, note that this probabil-
ity conditional on searching in the school is
Pr(w r|m d = o) = wr

=

(13)
which is the probability in equation (3) that we used to form our likelihoods, assuming
everyone who did not match in the outside market searched within the school.
When the probability of matching in the outside market is not 1, the IIA property
still holds, but we no longer have a good measure of the number of searchers in the
outside market. We do observe the probability of an outside match occurring, which is
the product of the probability of searching and matching outside the school,
P(match out|m s) = Pout
m s
× out
m s
(14)
142 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)
where m denotes a male type and s denotes their school and analogous expressions hold
for females. With one observation and two unknowns in each market, we explore the
robustness of our results to different values of Pout
m s
, the probability of matching outside
conditional on searching outside the school. We then reestimate the model under the
different assumptions regarding the probabilities of matching outside the school and
see how our estimated gender differences change.
In particular, using different values of Pout
m s
and knowing the share of each type who
matched outside of the school, we back out the implied outside-the-school search prob-
abilities. In our robustness checks, we set Pout
m s
to be the same regardless of the charac-
teristics of the individual. For example, suppose the outside match probability was set
at 0 8. If 10% of freshmen girls and 16% of senior girls matched in the outside market,
the implied outside-the-school search rates would be 12 5% and 20%, respectively. We
then shrink the number of within-school searchers by taking out the implied number of
students who searched but did not match in the outside market.
More formally, denote No
m
as the number of m-type men who matched in the out-
side market. The term Nm was defined as the number of searching men of type m in the
school and was formed as the total number of m-type men minus No
m
. With the probabil-
ity of matching in the outside market given by Po
m
, instead of forming Nm by subtracting
off No
m
for the population, we subtract off No
m
/Po
m
. Note that the utilities of searching in
the outside market are allowed to vary conditional on school fixed effects and individual
characteristics. The only restriction is that, conditional on searching in the outside mar-
ket, the match rate is the same. We need this to characterize the number of individuals
searching inside the school.
Another assumption made throughout is that all individuals engaged in search. Us-
ing data on the history of matching prior to wave I, we relax this assumption by assuming
a given fraction of those individuals who never matched (never had sex and never had
a relationship in the past or present) were uninterested in searching for an opposite-
sex partner. Assuming some individuals decided in a first stage not to search, we again
drop individuals randomly from the group who have never matched and reestimate the
model. We do this both with and without the assumption that all unmatched individuals
who searched did so in the school. We then reestimate the model in this new environ-
ment and again see how our estimated gender differences change.
Results for the estimated models under different match rate assumptions are pre-
sented in Table 12, with the first data column repeating the results of the original model.
The top rows of Table 12 show the mean choice probability for choosing sex without
equilibrium influences. As we move across the table, the composition of the sample
changes as a greater share of individuals move toward searching in the outside market
or are taken out of searching all together. We again use the subjectives as a check on the
appropriate outside-market match rate. Lowering the probabilities of matching outside
the school by themselves (data column 2) has little effect on our estimated shares of men
and women who are interested in sex. Data columns 3­6, which remove a share of those
who never matched from the search pool, however, perform worse by underpredicting
interest in sex for both men and women.

Note: To decrease the probability of matching outside the school, we adjust the number of unmatched who searched as
discussed in Section 5.3. We remove never matched individuals randomly from the individual sample of searchers, and shrink
the aggregate number of searching men and women by multiplying them by the probability of ever matching. This probability
is estimated from logit on ever matching at the type­school­gender level.
6. Counterfactuals
Having recovered the matching technology and preferences, the structural model per-
mits us to perform counterfactual simulations. We aggregate our sample of 73 Add
Health schools to create one large, representative school.34 We perform an initial sim-
ulation that shows how changes in the aggregate gender ratio affect men and women
differently by grade. Namely we increase the percent female by 10% in the aggregate
school, from 0 473 to 0 521, and examine the resulting changes in the probabilities of
being single and having sex, along with utility and market shares.
Results for white­white matches are presented in Table 13. All panels show percent-
age point changes in the probabilities, except the final panel, which shows expected util-
ity. A common feature across panels is the differential effects by grade: the first panel
shows the reductions in the probability of being single among men are higher for older
males. Similarly older females see a bigger increase in the probability of being single
than younger women.
The probabilities of sex track the probabilities of matching, but the probability of sex
conditional on matching reveals compromises in preferred relationships so as to match
at all. Market shares also reflect changes in utility, with younger females seeing larger re-
ductions in the chances of matching with older males (whom they prefer based on our
estimates). Market shares for matching with younger partners drop for males, reflecting
substitution toward having sex, but overall the grade-specific patterns show very little
substitution across partner grade. Finally, all the movements in terms and partner char-
acteristics arising in the counterfactual equilibrium can be summarized by changes in
expected utility. Females lose on average, as expected, but older women lose substan-
tially more. The largest gains in utility accrue to 9th-grade boys, who also have the largest
increase in the probability of sex conditional on matching.
34The constant returns-to-scale matching technology makes the number of individuals irrelevant.

the baseline level.
6.1 Black women and counterfactual environments
Next we examine why it is that black women in relationships are roughly 10 percentage
points more likely to have sex than white women. We focus on how much of this gap is
driven by differences between the matching markets faced by blacks and whites. Black
women face a different market than white women along at least two dimensions: (i) the
same-race fraction of females is much higher for black women and this fraction rises
faster with grade level and (ii) the probability of past sex for black males is far higher
than for white males. These differences all push the competitive equilibrium toward one
in which black women have more sex than their white counterparts.
Quantitative Economics 7 (2016) Terms of endearment 145
Our simulated counterfactuals move the matching markets faced by blacks closer to
those faced by whites in two counterfactual steps. First, we change the grade-specific
gender ratios among blacks to match those of whites, keeping the distribution of other
individual characteristics fixed. This is done by removing black women and adding black
men while holding the total number of blacks constant. Second, we change the distri-
bution of past sex among black men to match that of white men.
In Table 14 we present the aggregate school matching probabilities for black men
(Pw
m
) and black women (Pm
w
), focusing on same-race matches. As seen in the first two
rows in the upper left cell, a 9th-grade black female has a dramatically higher proba-
bility of matching in the sex market than her male classmate and her male classmate

Note: The CF refers to counterfactual, GR refers to gender ratio, and MPS refers to the "male­past sex" distribution. Coun-
terfactuals set the black gender ratios and male­past sex distributions equal to those of whites. Each cell gives the probability
of matching in sex or no-sex markets based on an individual's grade and possible partner grade. The Pw
m is the probability of
matching for a man looking for a woman; Pm
w is the probability of matching for a woman looking for a man.

can triple his probability of matching by searching in the no-sex market. The next two
rows (CF Only GR) report on the simulation where blacks face the same grade-specific
gender ratios as whites. This change increases (decreases) the probabilities of matching
in all markets for females (males), but not uniformly. Consistent with Proposition 1, the
percentage increase in the probability of matching is higher for women in the market
that they prefer: the no-sex market. This translates into women changing their search
behavior and results in a greater share of matches occurring in the no-sex market.
The last two rows (CF GR-MPS) show how the probabilities change when we ad-
ditionally adjust the past-sex distributions for black males to match those with white
males. By reducing the number of sexually experienced black men, competition among
men in the sex market is reduced. This increases the match probabilities of black men
searching in the sex market and correspondingly decreases the match probabilities of
black men searching in the no-sex market. The opposite changes occur for women: as
compared to the case where just the gender ratio was changed, women see higher match
probabilities in the no-sex market and lower match probabilities in the sex market. With
fewer black men having had sex in the past, demand decreases in the sex market, lower-
ing female probabilities of matching there and correspondingly increasing female prob-
abilities of matching in the no-sex market.
Table 15 captures how these changes in the probabilities of matching translate
into changes in the fraction of relationships with sexual engagement. For expositional
reasons we report a racial gap in sexual engagement for same-grade and same-race
matches only.35 The "racial gap" compares probabilities of having sex conditional on
matching. Table 15 reports the difference between these conditional probabilities for
Table 15. Racial gap in the probability of sex conditional matching under various market con-
ditions.

Note: Gap is measured as P(sex|match white with white) - P(sex|match black with black). Counterfactual policy simula-
tion changes the black gender ratios to match those of whites in three stages: changing the grade-specific gender ratio, then
the past-sex distribution for black males, and then the past-sex distribution for both black females and black males.

whites matched with whites minus that for blacks matched with blacks. The baseline
shows the 9­10 percentage point racial gap noted earlier. When we simulate (i) blacks
facing the same grade-specific gender ratios as whites, the gap shrinks, particularly for
younger couples, but the effects are small. Additionally adjusting the past-sex distribu-
tion for black men (ii) yields a much larger effect, between 65% and 75% of the gap for
10th­12th graders.
7. Conclusion
The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show how a directed search model
can disentangle male and female preferences for different relationship terms using vari-
ation in the gender ratio. When the researcher's goal is to understand differences in male
and female preferences for relationship terms, directed search provides an attractive
modeling approach.
Second, we have applied the directed search model to the teen matching market
and uncovered male and female differences in preferences for sex. The estimated prefer-
ences from the structural model match the self-reported preferences, providing a com-
pelling out-of-sample test for the validity for the approach. That men and women value
sex differently suggests that changes in sexual behaviors may have different welfare ef-
fects for men than for women. Further, when gender ratios tilt such that men become
a minority--as, for example, on many college campuses--women are more likely to en-
gage in sex conditional on forming a relationship, sacrificing their preferred relationship
terms for a higher probability of matching.
Our counterfactual simulations show that, conditional on matching, most of the gap
in sexual engagement between black and white women in high school is driven by the
unfavorable market conditions that black women face. If conditions faced by blacks (as
measured by the gender ratio and sexual experience of males) were similar to those for
whites, the racial gap in sexual participation would shrink between 65% and 75% for
10th­12th graders.
More generally, because changes in the supplies of various types of men and women
alter the equilibrium match distribution, such changes have the potential to deeply af-
fect the well-being of individuals--changing who enters unions of many types, who does
not enter at all, the characteristics of partners for those who do match, and the distri-
bution of surplus from unions among partners. These important links are reflected in a
growing literature on the effects of imbalances and changes in sex ratios within both de-
veloped and developing countries. Many of these studies focus on the effects of chang-
ing sex ratios on who does and does not enter unions and with whom those who enter
match.36 Other studies address the partial equilibrium effects on the intra-union dis-
tribution of the match surplus.37 But the methods in these studies cannot reveal the
separate preferences of men and women and how the trade-offs they face relate to the
supplies of various types of men and women. Our model and empirics take a step in that
direction.

. Beginning with the inequality between the ratio
of choice probabilities with female choice probabilities in the denominator delivers the
result for female match probabilities.
To evaluate claim (c), we use the implicit function theorem coupled with Cramer's
rule. We show the case when there is only one type of man and one type of woman
with two relationship types, r and r . For ease of notation, we then denote G = Gm
r
.
Our proof, however, holds in the general case due to the independence of irrelevant
alternatives associated with the type I extreme value errors. Note that the definitions
of search probabilities imply that, in equilibrium, the log odds ratios for women sat-

In both cases, the numerators are positive. Both have one negative term, F1/wr

and

, respectively, but this term is multiplied by negative 1.
The denominators are the same across the two expressions. The first term is positive
but the second term is negative. However, the first term can be written as the negative
of the second term plus additional positive terms. The sign of the denominator is then
positive, implying that both expressions are positive as well.
Appendix B
In this appendix we discuss three issues with the data: (i) determining the share of stu-
dents searching in the outside market, (ii) determining the distribution of prior sex for
males, and (iii) cases where females do not report characteristics of their partners.
To deal with the unobserved aggregate fraction searching outside the school, we be-
gin with a strong assumption and subsequently relax it. We assume initially that each
individual could match outside the school with probability 1. This means that we only
need the fraction of each individual type matching outside the school to correct the ag-
gregate gender ratios to reflect the number of men and women of each type search-
ing in the school. Using data on individuals who matched outside the school, those un-
matched and those matched in the school, we estimate a logit on matching outside the
school that is a function of individual grade, race, and school fixed effects, and we do
152 Arcidiacono, Beauchamp, and McElroy Quantitative Economics 7 (2016)
so separately for men and women. For example, we specify the probability of matching
outside the school for an m-type man at school s as
P(match out|m s) =
exp
g
I(Gm = g)g +
r
I(Rm = r)r + s
1 + exp
g
I(Gm = g)g +
r
I(Rm = r)r + s
(16)
The resulting predicted conditional probabilities are used to scale down the number of
searching men m and searching women w within each school.
We subsequently relax the perfect ability to match outside the school by imposing
that each match observed required more individuals searching outside the school so
as to materialize. For example, if we see that one male of type m matched outside the
school, assuming the probability of matching outside was one-half, we would reduce
the number of type-m men searching in the school by 2.
To deal with the unobserved distribution of male past sexual activity from using fe-
male reports, we estimate the conditional probability of past sex at the school level from
the male half of the original sample. We do this only among those who are not matched
outside the school; thus we specify the probability of past sex for an m-type man at
school s as
P(past sex|m s match out = 0)
=
exp
g
I(Gm = g)g +
r
I(Rm = r)r + s
1 + exp
g
I(Gm = g)g +
r
I(Rm = r)r + s
(17)
= s
m1
again using grade, race, and school fixed effects. These predicted conditional probabili-
ties are used as weights to integrate out the number of men searching in each market.
The next data issue concerns missing reports on partner characteristics. Because of
the likelihood approach it is straightforward to take what information we do observe
from reports on the partner characteristics and terms, and form likelihood terms that
integrate out over the missing data, very similar to how we integrate out over missing
search decisions in equation (11).
Appendix C
In this appendix we demonstrate the robustness of our estimation strategy to misspeci-
fication of the probability of matching outside the school. In our approach we estimate
the probability of matching outside the market as in Appendix B, as a function of type,
gender, and school fixed effects, but that model may be misspecified.

P(out misspecified) No Yes Yes
Note: The term P(out) is a function of type­gender ratio and their interaction; P(out) misspecified is only a function of the
gender ratio and type. Results are based on averaging 10 simulations.
In our Monte Carlo we generate the probability of matching outside the school as a
function of the type­gender ratio and their interaction. This is the form of misspecifica-
tion that is the most problematic, as it would invalidate the two-step approach we take
above (separating out-matching into a first stage, followed by within-school matching),
by making the first stage a function of gender ratio differently for different types. We ex-
amine how the estimator responds when we omit the interaction term. The results for
50 simulations are presented in Appendix Table C.1, where we only include two binary
characteristics and one binary term. The results when we correctly specify the prob-
ability of matching outside the school are presented under the "Information Structure:
Full" columns. As we can see the estimator preforms well. The large standard errors arise
when we remove the search decisions (results not presented), but point estimates are
still close to the truth. In the "Partial I" and "Partial II" columns we incorrectly specify the
probability of matching out, omitting the type­gender ratio interactions, but at differ-
ent overall and gender-specific levels. The results reveal that as out-matching becomes
more prevalent, our standard errors grow substantially (e.g., the sex preferences) and
point estimates move farther from the truth. The partner characteristic estimates are
more biased because individuals with certain characteristics are more likely to search
outside the school (e.g., older minority females match out at the highest rates), which is
mistakenly attributed to nonmatching under misspecification. The outmatching rates
we observe in the data are quite similar to those in the "Partial I" exercise (in the 20%­
30% range), where the level of bias is quite reasonable (less than 10% for all parameters).
