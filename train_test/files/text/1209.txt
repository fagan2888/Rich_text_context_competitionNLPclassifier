Abstract
Background: The SOD2 gene encodes an antioxidant enzyme, mitochondrial superoxide
dismutase. SOD2 polymorphisms are of interest because of their potential roles in the modulation
of free radical-mediated macromolecular damage during aging.
Results: We identified a new splice variant of SOD2 in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The
alternatively spliced product was originally detected by exon trapping of a minigene in order to
examine the consequences of an intronic polymorphism found upstream of exon 4 (nucleotide
8136, 10T vs 9T). Examination of the transcripts derived from the endogenous loci in five LCLs
with or without the intron 3 polymorphism revealed low levels of an in-frame deletion of exon 4
that were different from those detected by the exon trap assay. This suggested that exon trapping
of the minigene unmasked the effect of the 10T vs 9T polymorphism on the splicing of the adjacent
exon.
We also determined the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms in a sample of US African-
Americans and non-African-Americans ages 65 years and older who participated in the 1999 wave
of the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). Particularly striking differences between African-
Americans and non-African-Americans were found for the frequencies of genotypes at the 10T/9T
intron 3 polymorphism.
Conclusion: Exon trapping can unmask in vitro splicing differences caused by a 10T/9T intron 3
polymorphism. Given the recent evidence that SOD2 is in a region on chromosome 6 linked to
susceptibility to hypertension, it will be of interest to investigate possible associations of this
polymorphism with cardiovascular disorders.
Background
The free radical theory of aging is currently the leading
hypothesis for a fundamental mechanism of aging. It
potentially unifies aging mechanisms across an array of
species [1-5]. The theory postulates that reactive oxygen
species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals,
mainly generated as toxic by-products of normal cellular
metabolism during aerobic respiration in mitochondria,
give rise to damage to wide variety of macromolecules,
including DNA. Animals possess enzymes that scavenge

ROS. Among the most important of such antioxidant
defenses are the superoxide dismutases (SOD), which
facilitate the dismutation of superoxide free radical (O2
-.)
[6]. There are three types of SODs in higher eukaryotes, a
copper/zinc containing cytoplasmic enzyme, SOD1; a
manganese containing mitochondrial enzyme, SOD2;
and a copper/zinc containing SOD3 that is prevalent in
extracellular spaces [6,7].
SOD2 is constitutively expressed in most cells [8]. SOD2
gene dosage correlates with longevity in fruit flies and in
mice [9]. Mice that are heterozygous for an SOD2 knock-
out accumulate excessive damage to mitochondrial DNA
as they age [10]. In these mouse lines, there were no com-
pensatory increases of other antioxidant enzymes such as
SOD1, catalase or glutathione peroxidase [11]. There is lit-
tle understanding of the role of SODs in the modulation
of longevity or health status in aging humans. Human dis-
orders due to the SOD2 mutations have yet to be identi-
fied. However, a number of studies describe associations
of SOD2 polymorphisms (particularly Ala16Val) with
age-related disorders. One such study of elderly people
with an Ashkenazi ethnic background suggested a possi-
ble association between Val at codon 16 of SOD2 and lon-
gevity [12]. Individuals who were homozygous for the
valine allele at position 16 (also described as the -9 posi-
tion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence) were shown
to have an increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer
[13,14]. The Val allele may also be a predisposing factor
for diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in Russians with type
1 diabetes mellitus [15]. Finally, homozygosity for the Val
allele was also associated with non-familial idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy among Japanese [16]. This was
thought to be due to a decreased efficiency of SOD2 trans-
port into mitochondria [16].
In contrast to the above reports, the alanine allele has
been associated with high risk of breast cancer among U.S.
and Finnish Caucasians [17,18] and with an increased risk
of developing psoriatic arthritis in the Taiwanese popula-
tion [19].
As is typical of such association studies, most have not
been confirmed in independent populations. Linkage
studies are therefore of interest. A particularly cogent
example is a report of a genome scan of microsatelite
markers among hypertensive African-Americans; linkage
was described at 6q24 and 21q21 [20], with Z scores,
respectively, of 4.14 and 4.34. Markers associated with
hypertension in African-Americans are between 112 cM
and 166 cM of 6q. SOD2 is located at 160 cM.
The National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) reports on
the functional status of cross-sectional and longitudinal
population-based samples from U.S. Medicare recipients
 age 65 [21]. During the 1999 wave of that survey, bio-
logical samples were obtained. This provided an opportu-
nity to examine SOD2 polymorphisms among different
ethnic groups.
Results
The 1999 NLTCS populations
DNA was obtained from a total of 644 blood samples.
Each DNA isolation gave an average of 40 ug of DNA, suf-
ficient for 800 PCR reactions. We also received 2,102 buc-
cal wash samples of which 2,078 provided DNA suitable
for banking. There was sufficient DNA from buccal wash
samples to permit the performance of up to ~400 PCR
reactions.
Screening studies were performed using genomic DNA
from peripheral blood. Because a striking difference in the
frequencies for the polymorphism at the nucleotide posi-
tion 8,136 was observed among African-Americans (see
below), studies of that polymorphism were extended to
the larger sample of genomic DNA from buccal samples.
SOD2 polymorphisms
We first sequenced exons 1 through 4 and the coding
regions of exon 5, including approximately 50 nucleotides
into the introns from the exon-intron junctions (Table 1).
Exons 1 and 2 were amplified in one amplicon, and exon
1 with the adjacent intron (including a A/G polymor-
phism at nt 36) was sequenced with the forward primer,
and exon 2 with the reverse primer.
We identified five SOD2 polymorphisms, defined as those
with minor allele frequencies that were greater than 1%
(Table 2, Figure 1). In addition to these polymorphisms,
we observed one individual heterozygous for a synony-
mous change, T to A, at nt 10574 (A188A); one individual
heterozygous for a C-to-G change at nt 10577 (Y188X);
one individual with a heterozygous A-to-G change at nt
10591 (K194R); one individual heterozygous for a T-to-G
change at nt 10595 (N195K), and one individual with a G
insertion at 10604 (resulting in the frame shift and pre-
mature termination at amino acid 214). We confirmed
these five heterozygous changes by sequencing of the
reverse strands. One or more of these may prove to be
mutations. No other alterations were observed.
Is the intron 3 T9/T10 polymorphism associated with
splicing variations?
Among the five polymorphisms studied, a single base pair
deletion at nucleotide 8,136 was designated as T9 and the
wild type was designated as T10. Since the T10/T9 poly-
morphism is close to the intron-exon junction, we
explored the possibility that this polymorphism may
affect the splicing of exon 4. An approximately 3 kb frag-
ment spanning intron 2 to exon 5 was inserted into an

exon trap system to determine how the fragments were
processed. RT-PCR showed that the minigene containing
T9 was shorter than expected by approximately 100 bp
(Figure 2). Sequencing of the RT-PCR products revealed
that the spliced product from the T9 minigene deleted
exon 4. Exon 3 was joined directly to exon 5. The RT-PCR
product generated from the minigene containing the T10
yielded wild type product, exon 3 being joined to exon 4
followed by exon 5.
Exon trapping, however, is a highly artificial system. The
splicing of the minigene occurs out of context of the com-
plete genome. In order to examine whether deletion of
exon 4 can be spliced out in intact cells, lymphoblastoid
cell lines were established from four T10 homozygotes
and four T10/T9 heterozygotes. SOD2 mRNAs from these
cell lines were amplified by RT-PCR. We utilized one
primer set that amplifies only those mRNA deleting exon
4 and another set which amplifies both wild type and the
exon 4-deleted form (Figure 3). Ethidium bromide stain-
ing of RT-PCR products showed that LCLs from both
homozygous 10T and heterozygous T9/T10 subjects were
expressing wild type SOD2 mRNA and the aberrant form
deleting exon 4 to similar extents. These RT-PCR products
were sequenced to confirm that they are all SOD2 mRNA,
with or without exon 4. When both forms were simulta-
neously amplified, only wild type mRNA was detected,
indicating that the predominantly spliced forms were wild
type in cells from both genotypes. These results suggest
that the exon-trapping assay excluded cis-acting factors
required for the inclusion of exon 4 when one T is missing
at the IVS4-6 position.
Dramatically altered 8136 allele frequencies within the
African-American population
The 644 blood samples were derived from 596 Cauca-
sians, 43 African-Americans, 2 Asian/Pacific islanders, and
3 "others". Statistically significant differences between
African-Americans and Caucasians were observed for
three out of five polymorphisms. At the Ala16Val poly-
morphism in exon 2 (which has been reported to alter the
risk of several disorders), the Val (GTT) was more frequent
than Ala (GCT) in the African-American population (P =
0.044). The C8039G polymorphism in intron 3 also
showed a statistically significant difference between Afri-
can-Americans and Caucasians (P = 0.031). A statistically
significant difference was not observed for the case of the
adjacent G8116T polymorphism (P = 0.093).
Among the five polymorphisms studied, the most striking
finding was a difference in the frequencies of the polymor-
phism at nucleotide 8,136 (Table 2). A single base pair
deletion was designated as T9 and the wild type desig-
nated as T10. Among 40 African-Americans, 18% carried
one T9 allele, significantly higher than the average for the
total population (1.7%) and strikingly higher when com-
pared to the population of non-African-Americans
(0.7%). We then examined this T9/T10 polymorphism in
buccal samples that were obtained from African-Ameri-
cans. Out of 67 African-Americans who provided buccal
wash samples, 54 (81%) were T10/T10 and 13 (10%)
were T10/T9. No individual has been found to be
homozygous for the T9 allele. The allele frequencies from
blood and buccal samples were comparable. We con-
cluded that the T9 allele is far more frequent in elderly
African-Americans than in non-African-Americans (p <
0.0001).
Discussion
The T9/T10 SOD2 polymorphism was newly identified in
our laboratory in the course of screening of the 1999
NLTCS population for SOD2 polymorphisms. Our analy-
sis indicated that the T9 allele is highly prevalent in eld-
erly African-Americans as compared to elderly Caucasian-
Americans (p < 0.0001). The location of T9/T10 at an
intron/exon boundary region suggested a role in pre-

mRNA processing. An exon trap analysis was quite con-
sistent with this interpretation. There are a number of
examples in the human genetics literature in which intron
polymorphisms appear to have altered the ratio of wild
type and alternative splicing patterns [22,23]. In some
cases, altered splicing was shown be responsible for the
pathogenetic mechanism leading to disease. Interesting
examples are the sequence variations at the 3' end of
intron 8 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). These are thought to affect splicing of
exon 9, resulting in the reduction of functional CFTR [24].
For the case of our SOD2 T9/T10 polymorphism, how-
ever, it was not possible to confirm the splicing bias using
RNA from intact cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines). Simi-
larly, we were unable to determine what fractions of the
transcript lacking exon 4 were derived from T10 and T9
alleles in the heterozygote.
Previous work from our laboratory showed that intronic
polymorphisms generated cryptic splicing products by
exon trapping or by assays utilizing a mini gene and RT-
PCR, but there was little evidence that this occurred in vivo
[25]. The most likely interpretation of this discordance in
the results of test tube-based versus cell-based methods is
that the former exclude important cis-acting domains
residing in more distal domains of DNA. In addition,
trans-acting factors may differ among different cell types
and species. These elements are likely to be capable of
modulating splicing.
Although we have so far failed to provide molecular evi-
dence for a functional distinction between the polymor-
phic allele of interest, given the striking difference in
prevalence among African-Americans as compared to
Caucasian-Americans, it will be important to carry out
appropriate epidemiological studies of the impact of the
two alleles (and, eventually, contrasting haplotypes),
upon health and survival in the two ethnic groups. The
NLTCS should provide valuable material for such an
investigation, as there is linkage to Medicare data and data

on functional status and survival. A definitive study, how-
ever, must await the availability of biological material
from future cohorts, as the 1999 wave of the study could
not provide biological specimens from many institution-
alized subjects.
Perhaps the most immediate question would be the
potential impact of this allelic variation of SOD2 upon
susceptibility to hypertension among African-Americans.
First, hypertension is pervasive in this population. Sec-
ondly, it has deleterious effects upon multiple organs.
Third, while susceptibility to hypertension is clearly mod-
ulated by multiple genetic loci, a region of chromosome 6
that encompasses the SOD2 locus is among those that
have been implicated [26]. Fourth, African-Americans
provide an excellent opportunity to carry out admixture
mapping (reviewed by [27,28]. It has been estimated that
~75% of the alleles of African-Americans are of African
ancestry whilst ~25% are of European ancestry [29]. Gene
scans on the parental and admixed populations were suc-
cessfully employed to identify hypertension loci by Zhu et
al. (2005). The most robust finding was a region on the
long arm of chromosome 6 that included the SOD2 locus.
While the region contains many genes, potentially includ-
ing more than one susceptibility genes, our observations
suggest that one important candidate gene is SOD2.
Conclusion
We demonstrated that the 10T/9T polymorphism in the
SOD2 intron 3 clearly results in alternative splicing of
exon 4 by an in vitro exon trap assay using minigenes. This
difference was masked when endogenous genes were
expressed within cells. Over-representation of 9T alleles in
African-Americans nevertheless raises the possibility that
this intron 3 polymorphism or polymorphisms in linkage
disequilibrium may be involved in the altered susceptibil-
ities to a range of disorders that are more common in Afri-
can-American populations.
Methods
Sample collection and DNA isolation
Both peripheral blood and buccal wash samples were
obtained from the 1999 NLTCS participants. Informed
consent was obtained. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (Amer-
sham, CA, USA) gradient. Buccal wash samples were cen-
trifuged at 3,000 Ã g prior to DNA isolation. Genomic
DNA from blood and buccal wash samples were isolated
with QIAamp blood isolation kits or QIAamp tissue isola-
tion kits, respectively (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA), follow-
ing protocols specified by the manufacturer. For high
throughput DNA isolation, a Qiagen BioRobot 3000 sys-
tem was employed for DNA manipulation. Isolated

genomic DNA samples were kept in 96 well microtiter
plates in duplicates, and stored at -80Â°C.
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection
The SNPs in SOD2 were determined through direct
sequencing of SOD2 exons and adjacent portions of
introns. Briefly, genomic DNA was first amplified by 4 dif-
ferent primer pairs (Table 1), designed using Primer
Express software (Applied Biosystems Co., Foster City,
CA), to obtain DNA fragments containing exons 1 and 2,
exon 3, exon4, and exon 5, respectively. The primer pairs
were designed to specifically amplify the designated
exon(s) with maximum adjacent upstream and down-
stream intron sequences. All PCR products were first
examined on agarose DNA electrophoresis to verify size
and were treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and
exonuclease I to eliminate excess nucleotides. The subse-
quent sequencing of the PCR products was performed by
a Big Dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI) on an ABI
PRISM 310 automated DNA sequencer with factory-sup-
plied parameters. The sequencing primers for the 4 PCR
products are also listed in Table 1. Newly found polymor-
phisms were confirmed by sequencing in the reverse ori-
entation in all of the samples.
Statistical analysis
Distributions of allele frequencies within the groups were
examined with the chi-square test (one degree of free-
dom) to test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compari-
sons of the distributions between two groups were tested
by the modified Fisher exact test (two degrees of freedom)
[30,31]. The latter was also examined with the standard
Pearson chi-square test [32].
Exon trapping
Exon trapping was performed to reveal the potential of
SNPs to promote differential splicing of SOD2 exons.
Genomic fragments of different alleles of SOD2 were first
amplified with a set of primers (forward: gct ggt ccc att atc
taa tag c; reverse: cag tag agc atc tct ccc aaa tg) encompass-
ing SOD2 intron 2 to exon 5 by long-range PCR (Roche
Diagnostics Co. Indianapolis, IL). The DNA fragments
carrying the SNPs in question were cloned by TA cloning
techniques (Invitrogen, Hercules, CA), and the SNPs were
verified by sequencing. The selected genomic DNA frag-
ments with the intended SNPs were subcloned into a
pSPL3 splicing vector for exon trapping analysis (Invitro-
gen Co. Carlsbad, CA). The nucleotide sequences at the
polymorphic site were confirmed by sequencing, and the
constructs were verified via the digestion patterns of com-
binations of restriction enzymes. The exon trapping pro-
cedures were performed according to the manufacturer's
specifications. The genomic DNA in pSPL3 was first iso-
lated with a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen), and was
used to transfect COS-7 cells for transient expression of
the reporter system. Exon trapping reporter transcripts
were examined by extracting total RNA from COS-7 cells,
followed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) with primers specified in the kit for
amplification of the reporter gene. The amplified reporter
gene fragments were visualized on 2% agarose gels. Varia-
ble lengths of the amplified fragments revealed differen-
tial splicing as affected by the inserted alleles in the
reporter system.
Establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines and RT-PCR
Cryopreserved lymphocytes were thawed and immortal-
ized with Epstein-Barr virus using a published protocol
[33]. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Gibco BRL) and
was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers with
GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus Inc., Welles-
ley, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR
reactions were performed as described previously [30,31].
The products were separated on a 2% agarose-1xTAE gel.
