Introduction
Four previous articles have challenged traditional concepts
of "adolescent risk taking," including the "age­crime curve,"
for mis-attributing behaviors associated with the high rates
of poverty and disadvantage suffered by young people to
age-based biological and developmental traits (Brown &
Males, 2011; Males, 2009a, 2009b; Males & Brown, 2013b).
They argued that traditional theories of natural teenage crim-
inality, violence, recklessness, peer orientation, and risk tak-
ing incorporate a traditional error: the failure to control for
external disparities in socio-economic status (SES), includ-
ing conditions of poverty, before imposing concepts of inter-
nal bio-developmental limits. The evidence for the claim that
"adolescent risk" is an artifact of adolescent poverty is
straightforward: Where subjected to the same economic dis-
advantages, as teenagers are on average, middle-aged adults
(thought to be a mature, risk-averse demographic) display
higher "teenaged" outcomes with respect to such "adolescent
risks" as serious crime, violent crime, firearms mortality, and
fatal traffic crashes. Conversely, where teenagers enjoy the
same advantaged economic conditions as the average mid-
dle-aged adults, teenagers display "middle-aged" outcomes
(Brown & Males, 2011; Males & Brown, 2013a, 2013b).
These studies do not make any inferences about individual
risk taking; their focus is on populations.
Although these studies have proven controversial, the lit-
erature disputing their findings is very sparse. Virtually all
studies that have advanced traditional assertions of adoles-
cent versus adult risks have failed to control for inter-age
disparities in SES; other studies have controlled only for race
or geography or examined only a single young cohort. Such
limited methods are insufficient to sustain conclusions about
adolescent risk taking. Exhaustive literature searches by the
authors and by other researchers have revealed only one
other study of the interaction of age and economic disadvan-
tage in predicting risk taking: Shulman et al. (2013a),
Steinberg, and Piquero's (2013) analysis of National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data that finds no
age­poverty interaction for ages 12 to 23 in self-reported
offending. However, this cohort study is limited in age range
and fails to control for major confounds such as period
effects, as will be discussed.
The absence of adolescent-versus-adult behavior studies
that incorporate comparative SES interactions is related to an
inconsistency in theoretical treatment. When explaining even
large discrepancies in behaviors between population groups,
modern theorists and researchers reject internal biological
(i.e., neurological) and developmental (i.e., risk taking) traits

Age, Poverty, Homicide, and Gun
Homicide: Is Young Age or Poverty Level
the Key Issue?
Mike Males1
Abstract
Traditional theories of "adolescent risk taking" have not been validated against recent research indicating that youthful
traffic crash, violent crime, felony crime, and firearms mortality rates reflect young people's low-socio-economic status (SES)
compared with older adults', not young age. Aside from a small number of recent, conflicting studies, the literature gap on
this key issue remains. The present study examines the 54,094 homicide deaths, including 41,123 gun homicides, victimizing
California residents ages 15 to 69 during 1991 to 2012 by poverty status. Without controlling for poverty, homicide rates
display the traditional age-curve peaking at 19, then declining. When poverty is controlled, the traditional age-curve persists
only for high-poverty populations, in which young people are vastly over-represented, and homicide rates are elevated for all
ages. This finding reiterates that "adolescent risk taking" may be an artifact of failing to control for age-divergent SES.

in favor of external sociological conditions (concentrated
poverty, unemployment, discrimination, etc.; Gould, 1981).
Researchers and theorists acknowledge the crucial nature of
SES disparities when assessing behavior divergences
between Adult Population A versus Adult Population B,
Adolescent Population A versus Adolescent Population B,
and every other comparative analysis--except Adolescent
Age A versus Adult Age B. Researchers seem to assume that
the effects of SES disparity are inapplicable in only one
instance: when youth and adult behaviors are compared.
The failure to analyze divergent adolescent­adult SES as
a determining factor in divergent adolescent­adult behavior
is compounded by the resurrection of long discredited bio-
determinist notions. Recent small-subject functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies purportedly showing
youths use more primitive areas of the brain than adults in
decision-making have been interpreted as biological proof of
innate adolescent risk taking, sometimes generating extreme
statements. "Adolescents, on average, engage in more reck-
less behavior than do individuals of other ages" and are "bio-
logically driven" to risk taking, including criminal offending,
declared Steinberg (2007, p. 56). Such strident biological
interpretations are not warranted at this early stage of brain
investigation and involve more prejudice than science, as
evidenced by the fact that claims of greater adolescent risk
are made even when fMRI findings show adolescents use
more sophisticated cortical reasoning than do adults (Baird,
Fugelsang, & Bennett, 2005). More recent, decisive reviews
of multiple studies have found fMRI findings "puzzlingly"
overstated (Vul, Harris, Winkielman, & Pashler, 2009, p.
274) and have failed to replicate earlier fMRI claims (Boekel
et al., in press). As brain imagings do not demonstrate greater
risk-taking propensity in and of themselves, the theory of
adolescent crime proneness remains founded in crime statis-
tics whose age-discrepant external variables have not been
controlled prior to assertions of age-discrepant internal
drivers.
This study attempts to fill this literature gap by extending
the previous analyses of age­poverty interactions to examine
one of the most serious forms of alleged "adolescent risk tak-
ing": homicides, especially by firearms. Both research and
popular literature regularly depict homicide, especially gun
killings, as an adolescent and young adult risk behavior; one
prominent team even dubbed these young ages as "deadly
demographics" (Fox & Piquero, 2003, p. 339; see also
Bennett, DiIulio, & Walters, 1996; National Research
Council, 2006; Reyna & Rivers, 2008; Wilson & Herrnstein,
1994). Even the nation's highest legal authority has depicted
homicide as a particular teenaged risk (Supreme Court of the
United States, 2012).
Background and Literature Review
Decades of research have consistently upheld that poverty
and related social disadvantage are key factors promoting
criminality (see Donziger, 1996; Jencks, 1992; Shelden,
Tracy, & Brown, 2001), though they disagree as to the extent
and mechanisms (Wright, Caspi, Moffitt, & Silva, 1999).
The lengthy, general literature reviews in previous studies
(see Brown, 2009; Brown & Males, 2011; Males & Brown,
2013a, 2013b) examining varied, historical theories of crimi-
nal behavior and reaffirming SES as a critical factor when
comparing differences in offending by population groups
will not be repeated here. Rather, the present review will
extend these past literature reviews by adding the recent,
small body of population and cohort studies that examine age
and SES in the context of risk behaviors.
There appears little investigation of how poverty interacts
with age across the life span to produce theories of deviance
and risk taking (Brown & Males, 2011; McCall, Land,
Dollar, & Parker, 2012; Phillips, 2006). In particular, there
appears no literature other than by Males and Brown that
assesses the interaction of poverty, age, and risk behaviors
for ages above 24. The sparse literature on age­poverty inter-
actions falls into two categories: population-level studies and
cohort studies, each of which present advantages and weak-
nesses. Cohort studies examine criminal offending longitudi-
nally along a birth cohort as it ages. This vertical approach
allows examination of trends within the cohort examined but
is vulnerable to "period effects" in that its results are not gen-
eralizable to other cohorts that may display different patterns
in different time periods. In contrast, population-level stud-
ies analyze offending rates horizontally across generations
during the same time period, a cross-sectional approach that
controls for cohort effects but may not be generalizable to
other time periods. It is difficult to apply cohort and popula-
tion studies to test or refute each other because they use very
different assumptions and methods, although synthesizing
their findings may prove useful.
Population (Macro-Level) Studies
Study of the effects of personal, socio-economic, and other
environmental factors on individual (micro-level) propensi-
ties to crime is supplemented by a literature that delineates
macro-level (population-wide) influences with strong pre-
dictive values on the distribution of crime (Pratt & Cullen,
2005). Both traditional macro-level theories, including insti-
tutional anomie and social disorganization (Cancino, Varano,
Schafer, & Enriquez, 2007), and more recent analyses (i.e.,
Sampson, 2012) have documented that community factors
powerfully affect criminal behaviors and related social phe-
nomena. One of the most "stable and strongest predictors" of
crime is the constellation of factors labeled as "concentrated
disadvantage" (Pratt & Cullen, 2005, p. 373), for which pov-
erty rate is a key measure. Individual-level and population-
level theories are not mutually exclusive and may be
integrated in studies of the mediation of environmental fac-
tors on individual behavior (Mufti, 2009).
Three relevant population-level studies by the same
authors, Brown and Males (2011) and Males and Brown
(2013a, 2013b), use California's unusually detailed crime
Males 3
statistics to conclude that adolescents' and young adults'
apparently elevated rates of felony crime, violent crime, and
gun violence mortality are due to their low-SES relative to
older adults', not young age. The 2013 article, replicating
2011 results, found that without controlling for SES, crime
rates displayed the traditional age­crime curve, peaking in
late adolescence and early adulthood (Males & Brown,
2013a). However, when poverty status was controlled by
means of comparing crime rates among 906 population cells,
each of which represented distinct age, race/ethnicity, county,
and poverty values, the traditional age­crime curve largely
disappeared. Where middle-aged adults suffered high rates
of poverty common to teenagers, they displayed higher
"teenage" offending rates; where teenagers enjoyed low
middle-aged poverty levels, they displayed lower middle-
aged crime rates. That is, "adolescent risk taking" is an arti-
fact of failing to control for age-divergent SES. These studies
suggest that adolescents and young adults, like non-White
races, suffer higher rates of crime and arrest due to poverty
and related economic disadvantages, not demographic char-
acteristics such as age or race.
However, these population-level studies have distinct
limitations. Owing to the difficulty of assembling complete,
detailed data sets by age, geography, and race and ethnicity
over multiple years, these studies examined 1 year's cross-
sections of crime, population, and poverty data for the state
of California, a large and diverse geography that may not
generalize to other locales. Multi-year data sets would allow
for control of cohort effects. Furthermore, population-level
studies examine demographic units and are not useful for
delineating individual risk.
Cohort Studies
Cohort studies also suffer from data limitations due to the
lack of consistent, complete surveys and archival tabulations
of representative populations over time. One recent study of
an inner-city cohort found that "neighborhoods explain a
large percentage of individual-level disparities"; in particu-
lar, neighborhoods with high levels of concentrated disad-
vantage as a result of entrenched poverty are especially
criminogenic (Sampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005, p.
6). Although "the probability of violence accelerates in early
adolescence for all groups [in the study], reaching a peak
between the ages of 17 and 18 and then declining precipi-
tously" (Sampson et al., 2005, p. 4), the larger work casts
doubt on the theory that aging itself produces a spontaneous
desistance from crime. Rather, routine criminal offending
diminishes coincident with "turning points" that arise from
"opportunities," such as stable employment, marriage, or
wealth accumulation, all of which are confounded with
increasing age (Laub & Sampson, 2003). Socio-economic
disadvantage appears to intensify and prolong "crime-prone
years" from adolescence well into adult ages (Phillips, 2006).
Conversely, cities with higher than average proportions of
economically and socially engaged young people had lower
homicide rates as the proportion of people aged 18 to 29 in
their populations increased (Fabio, Tu, Loeber, & Cohen,
2011).
The only cohort study directly assessing the age­poverty
interaction appears to be one limited analysis of NLSY
respondents born between 1980 and 1984. It found self-
reported criminal offending by youths age 12 to 17 (collected
in Wave 1 in 1996) declined sharply as that cohort aged into
young adults years (collected in Waves 6-7 in 2003), even
after economic status was controlled. "The age­crime curve
in adolescence and early adulthood is not due to age differ-
ences in economic status," concluded Shulman et al. (2013a,
p. 848). Because this study was published explicitly to refute
Brown and Males (2011, referred to as the "subject study" in
this subsection) and appears the only other study to incorpo-
rate SES in addressing the age­crime curve, an extensive
analysis of Shulman et al. (2013, referred to as the "counter-
study") is presented here.
First, the counter-study authors' repeated claims to have
"tested" and provided a "strong rebuttal" to Brown and
Males (2011) is questionable. A cohort counter-study that
uses an "age range . . . restricted to adolescents and young
adults" ages 12 to 23 is insufficient to "test" statements in the
cross-sectional subject study that encompassed ages 15 to
69. Questions of whether "poverty varies systematically with
age," or that the counter-study's findings can be combined
with previous studies that do not control for SES to argue
that biological and developmental reasons explain why
"crime is in fact committed disproportionately by the young"
(Shulman et al., 2013a, pp. 853, 858) are not supported by
the evidence presented.
Second, extensive re-analysis casts strong doubt as to
what the counter-study (published 17 years after the baseline
year of the cohort it analyzed) actually found. Only some of
the major limitations and inconsistencies in the NLSY data
base were acknowledged in the counter-study. The acknowl-
edged limitations include the problems that both those pro-
viding SES information and the household configurations
changed substantially from NLSY Waves 1 (parents) to
Waves 6 to 7 (young adults), and that differing proportions in
the three waves averaging around one fourth of the total sam-
ple provided no SES data. The counter-study's economic
analysis strongly depended on the authors' assumption that
NLSY respondents know "the gross household income (the
sum of household members' wages, child support, invest-
ment income, rental income, retirement income, gifts, gov-
ernment support) for the prior year" (Shulman et al., 2013a,
p. 852). This might generally be true for parents responding
in Wave 1 but is much less likely to be accurate for young
adults living with parents or roommates in Waves 6 to 7.
How many young adults know all sources of income of their
parents or housemates? In fact, parents'self-reported income
status in Wave 1 in 1996 is associated with just .13 to .20
(using the R2 values) of the income status reported by young
4 SAGE Open
adults in Waves 6 to 7 in 2002 to 2003. The association
between income status in Waves 6 to 7, 1 year apart, is just
.33; that is, most of those who were poor in 1996, or even in
2002, were not poor in 2003, and vice versa. These are
implausibly weak correlations given the unlikeliness of sig-
nificant income changes within the same (or somewhat the
same) set of individuals in such short periods. This indicates
the counter-study's estimates of SES by time period and age
are not consistently obtained. Thus, the counter-study cannot
be shown to have presented crime rates by earlier (adoles-
cent) and later (young adult) ages standardized to equivalent
income statuses over time, a flaw that would negate its
conclusions.
The counter-study's unacknowledged limitations are
equally troubling. These include the non-random dropout of
12% to 14% of the sample from NLSY Wave 1 to Waves 6 to
7. As dropouts disproportionately displayed greater personal
risk factors than those retained in the survey (Aughinbaugh
& Gardecki, 2007), a selection bias is created that may ren-
der later waves less likely to commit crime than earlier
waves. This bias affects not just self-reports of crime but also
the counter-study's inconsistent measures of income status.
These limitations and biases, not uncommon in cohort sam-
ples such as NLSY, make this data set difficult to use to ana-
lyze age, SES, and offending over time.
Third, and also serious, is the conundrum of "honestly
reporting one's dishonesty," a validity threat generic to self-
reporting surveys (see Lauritsen, 1998). The pattern found in
the counter-study could result either from a real decline in
offending or from a decline in willingness to report socially
disapproved behaviors by age and over time. The suspicion
that adults under-report their crime is reinforced by Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) clearance reports showing
juveniles are over-arrested; that is, they commit a substan-
tially lower proportion of crimes than their arrest proportions
would predict. For example, youths under age 18 accounted
for 11.1% of violent and 15.7% of property index arrests in
2013, but just 8.8% of violent crimes and 10.8% of property
crimes cleared by arrest (FBI, 2014). Lotke (1997) found that
fewer than half the youths arrested for homicide were ulti-
mately charged with that offense. The American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU; 2013) study of 13,000 Oakland
juvenile arrests found 56.6% were not sustained; while these
showed up on official tabulations of arrests, probation offi-
cers found no criminal activity meriting further action.
Similarly, public health statistics tied to a variety of
crimes, such as hospital emergency treatments and deaths
from abusing illicit drugs, peak at ages well beyond teen
years. Taken together, independent measures indicate that
the self-report data the counter-study relies on is not conver-
gent with official records. The authors' failure to present
strong literature findings of consistent self-reporting of
offending across the life span is a critical omission. While
the subject study uses a data set (arrests) that is biased against
its hypothesis that youth and adult crime rates equalize once
SES is controlled, the counter-study's data set (self-reported
offending) appears biased in favor of its hypothesis that ado-
lescents commit more crime than do adults.
Finally, due to admitted limitations and inconsistencies in
the NLSY, the counter-study by necessity used an out-of-date
cohort that fails to capture major changes in youth and adult
offending patterns--including dramatic weakening of the
age­crime curve--in recent decades that have been particu-
larly pronounced in the last 15 years (FBI, 2014). Criminal
arrest rates, particularly by younger ages, declined sharply
from 1996 through 2003--the time period used in the coun-
ter-study--and continued declining through 2013, the most
recent year available (Figure 1). In 1996, arrest rates peaked
at age 18 and displayed the familiar age­crime curve. After a
substantial decline in teenage crime rates and a lesser decline
in 20-age crime by 2003, arrest rates then peaked at age 19
and the age­crime curve had weakened considerably. After
even larger declines in crime among teenagers through 2013,
arrest rates peaked at age 21, and the age­crime curve all but
disappeared. Self-reported and victim-reported offending
measures also show disproportionate declines in youthful
offending from 1996 to 2003 and thereafter (Males & Brown,
2013a). The overall crime decline concentrated in young
ages easily accounts for the lower rate of self-reported
offending by ages 19 to 23 in Waves 6 to 7 in 2003 compared
with ages 12 to 17 in Wave 1 in 1996 independently of any
effects from aging. The failure of the counter-study to include
a control series (which is not available in the NLSY) to adjust
for general changes in crime also risks negating its findings.
Authors further make no effort to control for "college
poverty," the temporarily low incomes of college students
who typically also have low crime rates, a major problem
given the counter-study's limited, under-24 age range and
inconsistent income measure. The "college poverty" issue
was acknowledged in the subject study but constituted less of
a problem because of that study's much broader age range.
In every case, the critical limitations and omissions of the
counter-study contribute to a pro-hypothesis bias. The advan-
tage of the NLSY's potential to capture offenses not reported
to police is more than offset by its limitations in terms of
confinement to a single, outdated, young cohort age, incon-
sistent measurement of SES and offending, and attrition of
higher-risk subjects over time. Regression models by race
and economic status derived from the counter-study's single,
limited, and confounded data set cannot reliably demonstrate
a generalizable age­crime curve even within their truncated
age range, let alone serve as a challenge to newer, popula-
tion-level studies encompassing much broader age ranges.
Age, SES, and offending clearly require more analysis.
Method
The present study uses population-level analysis of two crime
predictors: age and poverty rate. The premise derived empiri-
cally from macro-level statistics is that young populations
Males 5
differ substantially from older populations in more ways--
and potentially more important ways--than just age. One bar-
rier to analysis is that SES variables such as poverty level are
not captured in the official arrest statistics typically used to
construct crude age­crime curves. An alternative measure,
self-reporting surveys of criminal behavior, enables tabula-
tions of individual socio-economic variables that are not cap-
tured in official crime statistics, but self-reports may be
incomplete and unreliable (Lauritsen, 1998), and, in particu-
lar, may vary in reliability with age as previously discussed.
A third alternative, used here, is to use risk outcome and
census statistics to conduct population-level investigations
into whether disproportionately low-SES and high concen-
tration of high-arrest demographics among young people, as
opposed to young age per se, explains the "age­homicide
curve" in the same way they would explain the "race­homi-
cide curve." Homicide, particularly firearms homicide, fatal-
ity has been extensively cited as exemplifying the most
serious kind of age-based risk.
Homicide Tabulations
As an index, homicide has distinct advantages and disadvan-
tages. It is subject to rigorous investigation and is the only
criminal offense also tabulated as a vital statistics event. In
California, homicide deaths are available from the state's
Center for Health Statistics' EPICenter (2014) for the 1991 to
2012 period in considerable detail, providing homicide method
and single year of age by race and Hispanic ethnicity by county
of residence. This 22-year study period includes years of both
high- and low-homicide tolls and thus minimizes both period
and cohort effects as well as selection biases. However, it is
a relatively rare offense requiring large populations and mul-
tiple years to show definitive, detailed patterns.
To minimize the crime-inhibiting physical limitations of
very young and very old age, only ages 15 to 69 are assessed.
For these ages, all homicide deaths (N = 54,094), gun homi-
cide deaths (n = 41,123), and non-gun homicide deaths (n =
12,977) are tabulated for the four major races (Hispanic,
White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, Asian/Other not
Hispanic), for eleven 5-year age groups (15-19 through
65-69), and for the state's 58 counties for the study period.
These tabulations produced 2,552 raw, age-by-race-by-
county cells statewide.
Populations and Poverty Rates
Populations by single year of age, race and Hispanic ethnic-
ity, county of residence, and year are available from
EPICenter (2014) and the California Department of Finance
(2014) for the entire period. Poverty rates--the percentage of
the population living in households with incomes below fed-
eral poverty guidelines--by age group, race, and county for
1999, a central year in the study period, are available from
the Bureau of the Census (2014) for 88% of these 2,552 cells.
After excluding the 305 minimal population cells without
calculated poverty rates, 2,247 cells containing 99.95% of
the state's population remained available for analysis.
Poverty rates by single years of age by race and county were
imputed from grouped-age poverty rates by standard linear
interpolation (Shyrock & Siegel, 1976).

Analysis
For ages 15 to 69, separate homicide counts, population
counts, homicides per 100,000 population, and percentage of
the population in poverty were calculated separately for each
race, 5-year age group, 5% poverty bracket, and county by
standard SPSS software. Age groups were further collapsed
into standard 5-year age groups for those under age 30 and
10-year age groups for those 30 and older. Due to very small
numbers of young people in the two lowest poverty brackets
and very few older ages in the two highest poverty brackets,
the lowest and highest poverty rates were combined into less
than 10% and more than 25% brackets (Table 1). This analy-
sis is repeated for firearms homicides and non-gun homi-
cides. Excel charting functions produced both the crude
point-to-point arithmetic trendlines and the polynomial
regression lines based on least-squares expressions incorpo-
rating all data points into a continuous curve, shown in
Figures 2 and 3.
Results
Age and Poverty Levels
Table 1 provides the sums of homicide counts and popula-
tions by age group and poverty bracket. Poverty is heavily
concentrated in younger ages. California's teenagers and
young adults occupy very different economic environments
on average than older adults. More than half (52%) of 15- to
24-year-olds are in population cells with poverty levels aver-
aging 20% or higher, compared with fewer than 7% of adults
in their 40s and 50s. Conversely, just 9% of 15- to 24-year-
olds occupy cells with poverty rates averaging below 10%,
compared with over 63% of 40- to 59-year-olds. Even within
5% or 10% poverty brackets, younger people's average pov-
erty rate is higher than for older ages.
Commensurate with higher poverty levels, youths and
young adult populations have substantially higher propor-
tions of African and Hispanic Americans, whose homicide

for younger ages (Table 2). Among 15- to 24-year-olds, 81%
of homicides (including 83% of gun and 65% of non-gun
homicides) occurred among the occupants of brackets with
poverty levels of 20% or higher, while fewer than 2% of
homicides (including 1.4% of gun homicides and 4.5% of
non-gun homicides) occurred among the occupants of pov-
erty brackets below 10%. Older ages also show much higher
rates of homicide among those in the 20+% poverty brackets
compared with those in poverty brackets below 10%, but
there are so few occupants age 40 and older in the highest
poverty categories that homicide rates are more erratic and
the overall impact of poverty is much lower.
Age, Poverty, and Gun Homicide Rates
Crude rates of gun homicide mortality by age group, unad-
justed for poverty level--that is, the familiar age­murder
curves, including their polynomial distributions--are shown
in Figure 2. In the unadjusted distribution, both homicide and
gun homicide rates peak at age 19 and decline thereafter, and
rates for age 15 to 19 are 3 to 4 times higher than for ages 40
to 49.
Table 1 and Figure 3 show the complex results for homi-
cide rates when poverty rates are held constant across age
groups. When poverty levels are held constant, the traditional

age­risk curve, with rates peaking in teenage and young
adult years and declining thereafter, shows up only for pov-
erty levels of 20% or higher. These high-poverty brackets
containing just half the teenage and young adult populations
but accounting for four fifths of teenage and young adult gun
homicides are the ones that generate crude, unadjusted age­
homicide curves.
At poverty levels below 20%, age­risk curves are weak
and ambiguous, and teenaged rates become unremarkable. A
delayed age­crime curve appears at a constant poverty level
of 15% to 19%, with homicide rates peaking in the 20s and
30s and age 15-to-19's rates similar to those of adults in their
late 30s. In the 10% to 14% poverty bracket, the peak occurs
after age 30, and 15- to 19-year-olds' rates are similar to
those in their 40s and 50s. At poverty levels below 5%, only
an average of 0.2 gun homicides per year occurred among
the small population (2,500) aged 15 to 24 in that bracket,
producing rates that were low and erratic.
The goodness-of-fit of the polynomial trendlines to the
arithmetic trendlines is strong for poverty levels of 5% or
higher, with R2 values of well over .90 for poverty levels of
10% or higher, .82 for 5% to 9% poverty levels, and .54 for
the smaller, more erratic numbers at poverty levels of 0% to
4%, all of which are strongly significant. The near-complete
absence of young people from low poverty and older ages
from high-poverty brackets renders gun homicide rates more
erratic and error terms larger, but the association of poverty
with more homicide remains.
Discussion
Two salient facts, the first well accepted among modern
researchers and the second well documented by standard
social indexes, are evident: (a) poverty and social disadvan-
tage are crucial variables in assessing comparative levels of
criminal offending and other risks among varied populations,
and (b) adolescents, young adults, and older adult popula-
tions differ in significant ways other than just age, including
poverty level and other measures of disadvantage. This study
represents the latest validation of a long line of social science
research that incorporates measures of disadvantage as stan-
dard controls when evaluating statistical variations among
population groups--but which, curiously, have only rarely
and recently been applied to comparative studies of risk by
age.
In every case we have investigated of supposedly signa-
ture "adolescent risks"--fatal traffic crashes, firearms mor-
tality, felony crime, violent crime, and, in the present study,
homicide and firearms homicide--we find they are severely
mitigated or disappear altogether once the economic playing
field is leveled. The "age­crime curve" does exist in two
ways: (a) at every poverty level, murder rates drop off in the
50s and 60s, and (b) at poverty levels of 20% or higher, the
traditional age­crime curve prevails. It is the very high gun
homicide level (and to a much lesser extent, the higher
non-gun homicide level) in the poorest brackets occupied
heavily by young people that create the traditional "age­
risk" curve. That is, adolescent risks are artifacts of the real-
ity that the overwhelming majority of serious adolescent
crimes, including homicide, and other risk outcomes are con-
centrated in the poorest demographics--those with poverty
rates of 20% to 25% and higher--in which middle-aged and
older adults are seldom found.
Under this revised theory, young people do not "age out"
of crime, they "wealth out." The failure to consider SES as a
determinant in offending may also explain why studies
attempting to forecast crime trends from the age structure of
the population have proven so quickly and notoriously inac-
curate (Levitt, 1999; Males & Brown, 2013b).
Because poverty is an acknowledged, crucial variable and
the young are much poorer than the old, research that pur-
ports to affirm adolescent risk taking while failing to incor-
porate measures of age-based disadvantage in comparing
risks across the life span represents a deviation from standard
social science practice. Unfortunately, some researchers pro-
pose to perpetuate this omission. Shulman et al. (2013a;
2013b) summarized new efforts by "developmental scien-
tists from diverse backgrounds" who "have been making
rapid progress toward an integrated theory" that would
explain "at multiple levels" why "there is something about
adolescence as a developmental period that inclines youth
toward law-breaking behavior" and "increased willingness
to engage in risky conduct" (pp. 848, 858-859). Concluding
that their single, age-limited, methodologically flawed, and
fatally confounded study of one young NLSY cohort has
effectively established that "the age­crime curve in adoles-
cence and early adulthood is not due to age differences in
economic status," they welcome an "integrated theory" that
incorporates findings from neuroscientific work investigating
structural and functional changes in the brain that take place
during adolescence and may facilitate risk-seeking, as well as
results from psychological research examining age-related
changes in traits (e.g., sensation-seeking, reward salience, and
susceptibility to peer influence) related to this type of behavior.
(Shulman et al., 2013a, pp. 858-859)
Yet, developmentally and neurologically based risk con-
cepts remain poorly grounded. That "something about ado-
lescence," as we have shown in several studies, is a poverty
level 2 to 3 times higher than among middle-aged adults--a
"something" that middle-aged adults, when subjected to it at
teenaged levels, is also associated with middle-agers' greatly
heightened rates of crime and other risks. Economic disad-
vantage is the same "something about African Americans,"
"something about Native Americans," and "something about
Mississippians" that is associated with statistical excesses
for many risks--a "race­crime curve" or a "geography­
crime curve"--in these groups. However, this is not to say
that higher poverty, greater disadvantage, and lower SES
10 SAGE Open
engender the same effects within populations, and certainly
do not produce the same effects among individuals. With
regard to age, JosephAdelson (2008) points out, "transitional
periods--from early childhood to middle age"--produce
their own types of "inner and outer discord," and many indi-
viduals will not display tendencies found among other of
their age-mates (p. 157).
For example, the fact that rates of a comprehensive risk
index, violent death (accident, suicide, homicide, and unde-
termined deaths), are substantially higher among suppos-
edly risk-averse Americans ages 48 to 54 (75.5 per 100,000
population in 2012)--including surprisingly high risks
among non-Hispanic Whites (84.8)--than among the sup-
posedly risk-prone, more racially diverse ages 18 to 24
(60.1; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],
2014), could be used to formulate an integrated, bio-devel-
opmental theory of innate middle-aged cognitive deteriora-
tion (see Azar, 2010; Lu et al., 2004; Schaie & Willis, 2008)
and risk taking. Yet, excessive and rising external mortality,
along with rising criminal arrest (FBI, 2014), among
American middle-agers (despite their generally high-SES
and low-poverty levels) has received virtually no scholarly
or policy attention. If it did, one can safely bet the focus
would be on external conditions, not internal biologies.
Investigations consistently suggest that adults, including
researchers, favor their own aging peers while subscribing
to systematically negative stereotypes toward adolescents
(see Adelson, 2008; Buchanan et al., 1990; Enright, Levy,
Harris, & Lapsley, 1987; Hill & Fortenberry, 1992; Offer,
Ostrov, & Howard, 1981; Offer & Schonert-Reichl, 1992;
Public Agenda, 1999; Quadrel, Fischhoff, & Davis, 1993)
that constitute "a stubborn, fixed set of falsehoods," as
Adelson (1979, p. 33) termed it 35 years ago and recently
reaffirmed. In a review of 150 studies, Offer and Schonert-
Reichl (1992) lamented that so many, including researchers,
"continue to believe many of the myths about adolescence"
(p. 1004).
In that light, the "integrated theory" purporting to merge
biological- and developmental-stage theories to speculate
why adolescents "act the way they do" (Shulman et al.,
2013a) is simply the latest resurrection of 19th century
notions that combined supposedly innate biological- and
phylogenic-stage notions into theories speculating why
races, ethnicities, and genders "acted the way they did" (see
Gould, 1981). One only need consider the fact that homicide
rates are 18 times higher among the poorest than the wealthi-
est teenagers--or that 51,000 California 15- to 19-year-olds
in the lowest poverty brackets experience an average of just
1.1 murders per year (a European level), or that 40-agers and
50-agers subjected to the same poverty levels as older teen-
agers display the same levels of homicide (see Table 1)--to
come to the conclusion that innate biological and develop-
mental imperatives are at best marginal drivers of late ado-
lescent and young adult offending.
Limitations
This study continues preliminary, population-level investiga-
tion of risk outcomes by age. It concerns the association of
risk with environments of poverty and, to avoid the "ecologi-
cal fallacy," cannot be used to predict individual outcomes.
The study is confined to homicide and gun homicide, rare but
well defined and comprehensively tabulated outcomes that
have been asserted to display the traditional "age-crime" pat-
tern, and may not apply to unstudied risks. It is confined to
California, a populous state with large representations of var-
ied demographics that, nevertheless, may not be generaliz-
able to other geographies.
