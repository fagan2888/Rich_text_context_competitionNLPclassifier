Evidence and knowledge gaps for the association between
energy drink use and high-risk behaviors among adolescents
and young adults
Amelia M Arria, Brittany A Bugbee, Kimberly M Caldeira, and Kathryn B Vincent
Sales of energy drinks have increased rapidly since their introduction to the
marketplace in the 1990s. Despite the health concerns raised about these beverages,
which are often highly caffeinated, surprisingly little data are available to estimate
the prevalence of their use. This review presents the results of secondary data
analyses of a nationally representative data set of schoolchildren in the United
States and reviews the available research on the association between energy drink
use and risk-taking behaviors. Approximately one-third of the students surveyed
were recent users of energy drinks, with substantial variation by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity. Among the health and safety concerns related to energy drinks and their
consumption is the possible potentiation of risk-taking behaviors. The review of
available research reveals that, although there does appear to be a strong and
consistent positive association between the use of energy drinks and risk-taking
behavior, all but one of the available studies used cross-sectional designs, thereby
limiting the ability to make inferences about the temporal nature of the association.
Thus, more research is needed to understand the nature of this association and how
energy drinks, particularly those containing caffeine, might impact adolescent
health and safety, especially given the high prevalence of their use among youth.

INTRODUCTION
Although no formal definition has been proposed, bever-
ages labeled and marketed as energy drinks comprise a
heterogeneous beverage category, with most of these
drinks containing caffeine and a variety of other ingredi-
ents,including guarana,taurine,and B vitamins.1,2 Several
types of energy drinks are additionally carbonated and
contain sugar,3,4 although sugar-free variations are avail-
able.5 Public health concerns have been raised, primarily
because of the high levels of caffeine these beverages typi-
cally contain, both in amount and in concentration. The
amount of caffeine varies considerably, ranging from 50
to 500 mg per container,6 with some containers contain-
ing more than a single serving.7 Energy shots come in
smaller-sized containers, typically less than 3 oz. The caf-
feine concentration in energy shots differs by product,
with some products containing in excess of 100 mg per
fluid ounce.6 Currently, no maximal limit on caffeine is
imposed by the US Food and Drug Administration for
either caffeine-containing energy drinks or energy shots.
In contrast, the maximal limit on caffeine in a cola-type
beverage is 71 mg per 12 oz serving.8
Energy drinks were first introduced to the US mar-
ketplace in the late 1990s, and since then, there has been
rapid growth in both the number of different types of
products available and the varieties within a particular
brand.6 Industry data indicate that energy drinks and
energy shots constitute one of the fastest growing seg-
ments of the beverage market, with sales in the United
States expected to increase from $12.5 billion in 2012 to
$21.5 billion in 2017.9

Along with the rise in popularity of energy drinks
has been an increase in reports of emergency department
visits related to their use. Namely, from 2007 to 2011,
there was an estimated twofold increase in the number of
individuals presenting to emergency departments after
consuming an energy drink (from 10,068 in 2007 to
20,783 in 2011).10 A majority of these individuals were
between 18 and 39 years of age, with 42% using another
substance (such as prescription medications) in addition
to the energy drink. In 2011, 1,499 adolescents between
the ages of 12 and 17 years were admitted to the emer-
gency department following consumption of an energy
drink either alone or in combination with another sub-
stance. Multiple cases in which consumption of such bev-
erages resulted in hospitalization have been reported
voluntarily to the US Food and Drug Administration's
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse
Event Reporting System11,12; however,data on hospitaliza-
tions resulting from the use of energy drinks are not
systematically collected. Recent concerns about possible
cardiovascular effects from high levels of caffeine in
energy drinks have been raised in the scientific
literature.7,13­16 More generally, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has raised safety concerns about the inclusion
of energy drinks in the diets of children,17 and the Ameri-
can Medical Association issued a resolution to ban the
marketing of these beverages to individuals under the age
of 18 years.18
Data to describe consumption patterns among the
US population are scarce. Federally funded US national
epidemiologic surveys that track annual trends in health
behaviors and nutritional habits among adults and chil-
dren have included very few questions about the con-
sumption of energy drinks. In 2010, the National Health
Interview Survey included a supplement containing the
following question on the topic:"During the past month,
how often did you drink sports and energy drinks,such as
Gatorade, Red Bull, and Vitamin Water?"19 To our knowl-
edge, there have been no published reports of these data.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
accepts entries of energy drinks as part of a 24-h dietary
recall on beverages,and provides example cards of energy
beverages but it does not specifically inquire about their
consumption.20
One of the most widely used surveys to measure the
health-risk behaviors of American schoolchildren is the
NIH-funded Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey,
which began including questions about energy drinks in
2010. Estimates of consumption of alcohol containing
caffeine became available in the MTF reports in 2011
and indicated that 10.9%, 19.7%, and 26.4% of eighth,
tenth, and twelfth graders, respectively, consumed
caffeinated alcoholic beverages during the past year.21
For college students and young adults between the ages
of 19 and 28 years, these estimates were even higher
(33.8% and 36.7%, respectively). Although the data are
publicly available, the annual MTF reports have not
included consumption estimates for energy drinks and
energy shots without alcohol. Nevertheless, an analysis
of the MTF data on energy drinks and energy shots,
conducted by Terry-McElrath et al.,22 found an associa-
tion between the frequency of their consumption and
substance use; however, that study analyzed the use of
energy drinks and energy shots as one variable, rather
than analyzing use of the products separately. Addition-
ally, the study did not describe subgroup variation of
energy drink or energy shot use by race or grade level
and did not report data on the quantity of energy drinks
consumed.
It is important to understand the extent to which
energy drinks are becoming a part of the adolescent and
young-adult diet. The nutritional requirements during
adolescence, defined as the period between the ages of 13
and 18 years, is marked by complex hormonal changes
that result in pubertal development and growth. The
rapid physical growth that occurs during this period
requires the increased intake of calories, protein, vita-
mins, and minerals.23 Future eating patterns are often
established during adolescence, making this a critical
period with lifelong nutritional implications.24
No research could be located that focused specifically
on the potential effects of caffeine consumption on physi-
cal growth and development during childhood and ado-
lescence.However,the effects of caffeine use on disrupted
sleep patterns are well recognized.25 Interestingly,
daytime sleepiness related to caffeine and other substance
use has been shown to be related to poor academic
performance among a large sample of adolescents.26 A
laboratory study of caffeine use during a critical develop-
mental period has shown a relationship between caffeine
administration and decreases in sleep quality and brain
maturation.27
In addition to the attention paid to the possible car-
diovascular effects of consuming high levels of
caffeine,7,13­16 other research studies have pointed to an
association between consumption of energy drinks and
different types of risk-taking behavior among adoles-
cents and young adults. Adolescence is a peak develop-
mental period for risk-taking, which many believe is
normative and biologically driven.28 New research in the
field of developmental neuroscience has shed light on
the complex structural and functional changes that take
place in the brain from adolescence through the early
20s.29­35 These changes might explain why adolescents
are more likely than older individuals to take risks
without regard for possible consequences and why there
might be an inherent reliance on peers when making
decisions.
Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 72(S1):87­97

Because of the pharmacologic stimulating proper-
ties of caffeine, it is possible that consumption of
caffeine-containing energy drinks might potentiate the
risk-taking behavior that is normative to adolescent
development. At least two non­mutually exclusive
mechanisms have been suggested to explain the rela-
tionship between energy drinks and substance use. First,
from a biological perspective, through its interaction
with dopamine, early caffeine use could potentially
prime neural reward circuitry such that the individual
experiences a more positive response to other drugs.36,37
Supporting this hypothesis is evidence suggesting cross-
sensitization between caffeine and nicotine.38 Second,
consumers of energy drinks might be more likely to use
other drugs because of an underlying general propensity
for risk-taking.
The present review reports prevalence estimates of
energy drink and energy shot use by grade, gender, and
race/ethnicity from secondary data analyses of the MTF
data set. These findings are complemented with a
summary of results from studies utilizing college student
and adult samples. Secondarily, the review summarizes
research to date on the link between use of energy drinks
and various forms of risk-taking behavior.
USE OF ENERGY DRINKS DURING ADOLESCENCE
Data from MTF surveys are available for public use via
the National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program.39
To estimate the prevalence of energy drink consumption
among adolescents in the United States, data were ana-
lyzed from the 2010 and 2011 surveys, which represented
the most recent data available at the time the analyses
were performed. These secondary data analyses were
approved by the University of Maryland Institutional
Review Board. MTF is a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil
survey administered annually to eighth,tenth,and twelfth
graders attending more than 100 public and private
schools across the 48 contiguous states.40 Multistage
random sampling occurs first at the level of geographic
areas, or "primary sampling units"; next, at the school
level within each selected geographic area; and, finally, at
the class level within each selected school. Surveys are
then self-administered to all students in selected class-
rooms (or the entire school, for smaller schools). Due to
the large number of topics assessed, several alternative
forms of the MTF questionnaire are developed each year
(i.e., six for twelfth graders; four for eighth and tenth
graders), with each form containing only a subset of all
possible questionnaire items. Forms are distributed ran-
domly, and the resulting subsamples show no significant
differences.
Response rates for the 2011 survey ranged from 83%
for twelfth graders to 91% for eighth graders.40 Data were
downloaded from the National Addiction and HIV Data
Archive Program and analyzed using SPSS statistical soft-
ware41 to estimate the prevalence of energy drink use and
examine variations in prevalence estimates by grade,
gender, and race/ethnicity. Standard weighting proce-
dures were used to adjust for differences in selection
probabilities at each level of the sampling design (i.e.,
students, schools, and geographic areas) by assigning a
sampling weight,provided in the dataset,for each respon-
dent.42 Valid data from 2011 on the use of energy drinks
and/or energy shots were available for 5,207 eighth
graders, 4,965 tenth graders, and 2,209 twelfth graders
(weighted sample sizes). Analyses were replicated using
data collected in 2010 from separate samples of compa-
rable size (5,036 eighth graders, 5,089 tenth graders, and
2,142 twelfth graders); however, for ease of presentation,
comparisons across demographic subgroups are pre-
sented herein for 2011 data only.
The questionnaire provided participants with the fol-
lowing background information: " `Energy drinks' are
nonalcoholic beverages that usually contain high
amounts of caffeine, including such drinks as Red Bull,
Full Throttle, Monster, and Rockstar. They are usually
sold in 8- or 16-ounce cans or bottles" and"Energy drinks
are also sold as small `shots' that usually contain just
2 or 3 ounces." The questionnaire did not differentiate
between sugar-containing and sugar-free energy drinks,
nor did it differentiate between caffeine-containing and
non-caffeinated energy drinks. Ordinal responses to the
original survey question, "About how many (if any)
energy drinks do you drink per day on average?" were
recoded into a three-level categorical variable represent-
ing daily use ("One," "Two," "Three," "Four," "Five or six,"
and "Seven or more" per day), less than daily use ("Less
than one" per day), and non-use ("None"). No timeframe
was specified in the original question; therefore, current
use was operationalized as encompassing both daily use
and less than daily use. Similar procedures were used for
energy shots.
Figure 1A displays the 2011 prevalence estimates of
energy drink use by gender and race/ethnicity for eighth,
tenth, and twelfth graders. Overall, 35% of eighth graders
and 29% of both tenth and twelfth graders indicated they
used energy drinks. One striking observation is that
eighth graders were more likely to consume energy
drinks compared with tenth and twelfth graders. For
every grade, males were more likely than females to use
energy drinks. Black individuals had the lowest preva-
lence of energy drinks use regardless of grade. The
highest prevalence was observed among Hispanic eighth
graders (43%), and the lowest among black twelfth
graders (19%).
Figure 1B presents similar data related to energy shot
consumption. Overall, the consumption of energy shots
Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 72(S1):87­97 89
was less prevalent than for energy drinks, with 12%,
9%, and 10% of eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders,
respectively, using energy shots. While gender differ-
ences were similar to what was observed for energy
drinks, racial/ethnic variations were less apparent.
However, Hispanic eighth graders stood out as having a
particularly high prevalence (20%) relative to all other
subgroups.
Because questions on energy drinks and energy shots
were asked separately, it was possible to examine the pro-
portions of students consuming both types of products.
As shown in the lowest layer of bars in Figure 2, between
8% and 12% of students consumed both energy drinks
and energy shots. Interestingly, almost all of the energy
shot users also consumed energy drinks. Between 20%
and 24% consumed energy drinks, but not energy shots,
as shown in the highest layer of bars. It is also noteworthy
that there is considerable consistency in the results from
2010 and 2011.
Table 1 shows data on the daily use of energy drinks
and energy shots. Eighth graders showed the highest
prevalence of daily use for both energy drinks (18%) and
energy shots (7%). Consistent with results from
Figures 1A and 1B, Hispanic eighth graders stood out
Figure 1 Prevalence of recent energy drink (A) and energy shot (B) use, by sex, race, and school grade.
Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 72(S1):87­97
90
again as the subgroup with the highest prevalence of
daily use (22% for energy drinks and 11% for energy
shots).
Among individuals who consumed these products,
most drank only one or less than one per day (see
Table 2). Although individuals who drank two or more
per day were in the minority, their proportion decreased
with age, similar to the trends observed in overall preva-
lence of use and daily use. For instance, 24% of eighth
graders consuming energy drinks were drinking two
or more per day, compared with 16% and 13% of their
counterparts in the tenth and twelfth grade, respect-
ively. This trend was evident in all six of the subgroups
examined, but was perhaps most pronounced among
Hispanics, with nearly a threefold difference in two-a-
day use between eighth and twelfth graders (30% versus
11% drinking two or more energy drinks per day). On
the other hand, two-a-day use was most prevalent
among black eighth graders (33%). The age-related
decrease in quantity consumed was less consistent for
energy shot users. In at least two subgroups ­ namely,
females and blacks ­ the proportion of energy shot users
drinking two or more shots per day changed very little
with age.
USE OF ENERGY DRINKS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS
The prevalence of energy drink use among college stu-
dents is presented in Table 3.As the table illustrates,use of
these beverages varied substantially among the samples
studied, primarily because of the different timeframes
used to assess consumption. Both Arria et al.44 and
Miller45 reported that 10% of college students in their
samples were "weekly" consumers. Other researchers
reported higher estimates for weekly consumption.48 In
one study of energy drink consumption patterns,
Malinauskas et al.5 found that 51% of college students
consumed more than one such beverage each month in
an average month during the past semester. Across the
various studies,even with the differences in methodology,
use of energy drinks appears to be even more common
among college students than younger adolescents.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGY DRINK USE AND
RISK-TAKING BEHAVIORS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS
Several observational studies and one experimental study
have examined the association between energy drink use

and various types of risk-taking behaviors (see Table 3).
All of the studies were conducted among college students
and young adults, except for one study of 18-45-year-old
musicians. All but one of the studies gathered data using
cross-sectional survey designs, whereby questions about
energy drink consumption were asked along with ques-
tions about risk-taking behaviors. The results of these
studies are consistent and clearly show that users of
energy drinks are more likely to engage in risk-taking
behavior.
Many forms of risk-taking behavior have been inves-
tigated, including use of marijuana, tobacco, and other
forms of drugs, risky sexual behavior, and seat belt omis-
sion. Consumption of energy drinks, regardless of
whether they were mixed with alcohol at the time of
consumption, has been associated with alcohol-related
outcomes. In a study of 298 college students, Skewes
et al.48 found a positive association between the typical
number of energy drinks consumed per week and mea-
sures of alcohol dependence, current symptoms of
alcohol dependence, and alcohol-related problems when
controlling for age, gender, and frequency of binge drink-
ing. Specifically, consumption of energy drinks was posi-
tively associated with scores on theAlcohol Use Disorders
Identification Test (a screening tool used to identify haz-
ardous drinking),theYoung Adult Alcohol Consequences
Questionnaire (a measure of alcohol-related problems),
and the Short Alcohol Dependence Data questionnaire (a
measure of current alcohol dependence symptoms).
Typical frequency of energy drink consumption was also
associated with two types of alcohol use motives:
enhancement motives (i.e., drinking for enjoyment or for
fun) and coping motives (i.e., drinking to forget one's
problems).
Arria et al.44 found a positive relationship between
the frequency of energy drink use and risk for alcohol
dependence among college students, even after statistical
adjustment for the level of alcohol consumption (i.e.,
typical quantity) and a wide range of background vari-
ables and other known risk factors for alcohol depen-
dence, including sensation-seeking, conduct problems
before the age of 18 years, the age of first alcohol intoxi-
cation, depressive symptoms, and parental history of
alcohol problems. Demographic variables also included
in the model were sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and involvement in a fraternity or sorority. Also
unique to this study was that use of other caffeinated
products was measured and used as a covariate in the
analyses. The breadth of variables included in this model
was important because it points to the possibility that
energy drink use and alcohol dependence might be inter-
related in a meaningful way, rather than merely
co-occurring due to shared risk factors, such as a general
propensity to drink more alcohol.

Another study of college students reported that
approximately one-third of past-month energy drink
users had consumed the beverage mixed with alcohol.52
Frequency of energy drink use was also associated with
alcohol quantity consumed during a single event.A study
of young adults in Australia51 also found that alcohol
quantity was associated with consuming energy drinks at
least monthly. In another study, Miller45 found that
the frequency of energy drink use and alcohol pro-
blems were positively associated for white but not black
undergraduates.
A study of musicians between the ages of 18 and 45
years found that the frequency of energy drink consump-
tion was positively associated with binge drinking and
alcohol-related social problems, even when controlling
for demographic variables, sensation-seeking, impulsiv-
ity, and other types of caffeine use.46
Other substance use has also been associated with the
consumption of energy drinks, including marijuana,
tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription
drugs.43,45,46,53 Woolsey et al.53 found that past-month fre-
quency of energy drink use was associated with nonmedi-
cal use of prescription stimulants, with 22.2% of the
consumers using prescription stimulants for nonmedical
purposes. Miller45 found that consumption of energy
drinks was associated with nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion drugs among white,but not black,undergraduates.In
another study, Miller and Quigley46 also found that
energy drink consumption was associated with nonmedi-
cal prescription drug use even when controlling for other
types of caffeine use. Trapp et al.51 reported that consum-
ing energy drinks at least monthly was associated with
using ecstasy and marijuana, as well as the number of
illicit drugs used.
Several other risk behaviors have been linked to
energy drink consumption. Miller45 found that sexual
risk-taking (e.g., unprotected intercourse, having inter-
course under the influence of alcohol or other drugs),
participating in extreme sports, seatbelt omission, and
taking risks on a dare were more common among high-
frequency (at least once a week) energy drink consumers
than low-frequency consumers. Another study of college
students found that past-week consumption of caffeine-
containing energy drinks accounted for 29% and 21% of
the variance in anxiety and sleep disturbances, respec-
tively,when controlling for other types of caffeine use.50 A
study of students at a predominantly minority university
reported that energy drink consumption was associated
with drunk driving and riding in a car with an inebriated
driver.49
One experimental study has been conducted on risk-
taking behaviors related to energy drink consumption.47
Participants attended four sessions. They were randomly
assigned to consume one of four beverages at each session
in a counterbalanced order: a caffeine-containing energy
drink, alcohol, a caffeine-containing energy drink
mixed with alcohol, or a placebo beverage. Doses of
alcohol and caffeine were based on body weight. After
consuming the beverages, participants completed the
Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which is a laboratory
measure of risk-taking.A small but significant increase in
risk-taking was seen only among participants who had
consumed the nonalcoholic caffeine-containing energy
drink.
The only prospective study conducted to date on the
relationship between energy drink use and risk-taking
behavior was guided by prior research suggesting that use
of caffeine might exacerbate the underlying vulnerability
to the use of other substances. Arria et al.43 examined the
prospective relationship between use of energy drinks
during the second year of college and the risk for other
forms of drug use during the subsequent year, after
adjusting for prior use of each drug, demographic char-
acteristics, and the use of other types of caffeine. The
results showed that after adjustment for these variables,
energy drink users were more likely to initiate nonmedi-
cal use of prescription stimulants and analgesics and they
increased the frequency with which they smoked tobacco.
The adjusted odds ratio associated with energy drink use
for incident stimulant and analgesic use were 2.05 and
1.46, respectively.
The consumption of alcohol mixed with energy
drinks has been linked to acute health risks and serious
alcohol-related consequences.54­60 For further discussion
of the consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks,
see Marczinski et al.61 in this issue.
Among adolescents, Terry-McElrath et al.22 found
that the consumption of energy drinks and energy shots
is associated with past-month frequency of alcohol, ciga-
rettes, marijuana, and amphetamine use among eighth,
tenth, and twelfth graders, even after adjusting for demo-
graphic variables.
KNOWLEDGE GAPS
The analyses of MTF data presented here show that
almost one in three secondary school students in the
United States reported recent consumption of an energy
drink.Data on energy drink consumption from Canadian
adolescents shows wide variation by province, with esti-
mates ranging from 57.2% to 64.6% for adolescents con-
suming energy drinks during the past year.62
This high prevalence of energy drink consumption
underscores the need to demonstrate the safety of con-
suming these beverages, especially for individuals
between the ages of 13 and 18 years.As mentioned above,
the amount of caffeine per serving and the concentrations
of caffeine among the beverages in this class vary
Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 72(S1):87­97
94
widely.6,7 The acute and long-term health consequences
of such consumption are not yet fully known.
Research is needed to develop more comprehensive
assessment methods for energy drink and energy shot
consumption. Despite the methodological strengths of
the MTF survey, including its large sample size and its
national representation, only a few questions were asked
about the use of energy drinks and energy shots. Because
of this, the results cannot provide sufficient information
about patterns of use, specific products consumed, con-
texts, or consequences. It would be useful to know, for
example, the proportion of youth that have used various
types of energy drinks in a defined time period, such as
the past year or the past month, in order to more accu-
rately estimate how much caffeine is being consumed by
adolescents. Among users, assessments are needed that
can reliably quantify the amounts of the beverages con-
sumed (e.g.,typical,maximum,minimum) and how regu-
larly consumption occurs. Given the concerns regarding
the effects that ingesting high doses of caffeine can have
on acute cardiovascular functioning, and during physical
activity, future measures should attempt to characterize
patterns of energy drink use (e.g., acute, chronic) and the
contexts in which they are used (e.g., during exercise or
sporting activities),particularly since marketing messages
for energy drinks often involve associations with physical
activity and sporting events.18,63
At a fundamental level, it is important to understand
how these beverages are being incorporated into the usual
dietary intake of adolescents. It is possible that these
drinks are replacing other beverages (e.g., water, soda,
sports drinks), but they might, alternatively, be consumed
in addition to other types of beverages. Concerns have
been raised about the dietary choices that adolescents and
young adults make, including the types of nutritional
supplements and beverages they consume.64,65 Recent
data suggest that caffeine intake among children and ado-
lescents in the United States has remained steady during
the last decade, but the proportion of caffeine intake that
comes from energy drinks and coffee is increasing.66 The
extent to which energy drink consumption might be con-
tributing to weight gain is an aspect that is not as well
understood as for other sugar-sweetened beverages.67 The
data presented here show that few youth report consum-
ing energy shots alone; instead, energy shots are con-
sumed in addition to larger-volume energy drinks.
Although data from the MTF surveys do not differentiate
between sugar-containing and sugar-free energy drinks,
some of these beverages contain substantial amounts of
sugar in addition to caffeine. It will be important for
future research to understand the extent to which energy
drink consumption is a source of "empty calories" in the
adolescent diet, and therefore a potential target for
obesity prevention strategies. Malinauskas et al.5 reported
that 74% of college students who consumed energy
drinks drank sugar-containing versions, with females
being over-represented among individuals who con-
sumed sugar-free versions.
In contrast to the health concerns about the cardio-
vascular effects of energy drinks that have been raised
for several years, a newer concern relates to the poss-
ible effects of high levels of caffeine on the developing
brains of adolescents.27,68,69 A limit of 2.5 milligrams per
kilogram of caffeine per day has been suggested for
children.68
Specific subgroups appear to be at increased risk for
consuming excessive caffeine. Namely, eighth graders
were both more likely to have consumed an energy drink
and to have consumed greater quantities of such bever-
ages and energy shots than their older counterparts.Simi-
larly,Hispanic youth were more likely to consume energy
drinks and energy shots than other racial/ethnic groups.
No data are available to shed light on possible contribu-
tory factors underlying this observed subgroup variation.
Adolescents begin to make more autonomous dietary
choices during this time, and personal preference begins
to play a larger role.24 Although parents'influence on food
choices decreases throughout this period, parental mod-
eling still plays a role in determining adolescents' food
choices.24,70 For example, in one study of adolescent con-
sumption of soft drinks, adolescents were approximately
three times more likely to consume soft drinks regularly if
they reported that their parents also consumed them
regularly.70 Taste preference, peer habits, habit strength,
and mass media have also been identified as important
influences on the food and beverage choices of
adolescents.70­73 While it is tempting to speculate that dif-
ferences in family modeling of dietary practices or tar-
geted marketing practices might underlie these
differences, future research is needed to fully explain dif-
ferent patterns of consumption.
Little research has been conducted to understand
patterns of energy drink use among high-risk popula-
tions, such as young individuals with cardiovascular
abnormalities. No data are available to evaluate the safety
of consuming highly caffeinated energy drinks concur-
rently or simultaneously with stimulant medications
and/or illicit substances used by adolescents and young
adults.
CONCLUSION
With respect to the association between energy drink
consumption and risk-taking behavior, the studies
reviewed herein consistently demonstrate the existence of
an association. However, more research is needed to
clarify the nature of the observed relationship. For
example, it is not entirely clear whether the association
Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 72(S1):87­97 95
stems from a general increased propensity for risk-taking
behavior among energy drink users or whether energy
drinks potentiate risk-taking among users. A few studies
adjusted statistically for measures of general risk-taking
propensity still found strong associations between energy
drink use and alcohol-related problems.44,46 Further
research is needed to understand the extent to which
caffeine use during adolescence potentiates the reinforc-
ing properties of other substances, especially because it is
a period of rapid brain development.31,74 Additionally,
more longitudinal research is needed to understand the
temporal relationship between energy drink use and risk-
taking behaviors.The one prospective study conducted to
date observed a relationship between energy drink
consumption and the incident or "new" use of nonmedi-
cal prescription stimulants and analgesics, even after sta-
tistical adjustment for other indicators of risk-taking
behavior.43
Given other research suggesting that adolescents are
more likely to experience the rewarding properties of
substances,75 it is important to understand if high levels of
caffeine early in adolescence might be related to increased
risk for use of other psychoactive substances later in
life.36,37 It is clear that neurobiological changes during
adolescence partially explain why adolescents are more
likely than older individuals to engage in risk-taking
behavior76­78 and perhaps less likely to fully recognize the
consequences of such behavior. How the use of caffeine
and energy drinks fits into the sequence of underage
alcohol use and the use of other drugs among adolescents
requires further inquiry.
It is possible that energy drink consumption during
the developmental periods of adolescence and young
adulthood potentiates natural risk-taking behaviors of
young people due to the stimulating pharmacological
effects of caffeine. This possibility raises questions about
the appropriateness of marketing and selling highly
caffeinated energy drinks to adolescents because they
might be especially susceptible to the potentiating effects
of energy drink use on risk-taking behavior. More
research is warranted to fully understand the relationship
between energy drink use and risk-taking behavior and
how the dose and pattern of caffeine consumption might
mediate the relationship. Resolving these issues based on
scientific evidence is needed to promote and protect ado-
lescent and young adult health and safety.
