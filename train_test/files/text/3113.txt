Abstract
Background. Reduced renal function is associated with
a variety of biochemical abnormalities. However, the
extent of these changes and their magnitude in relation
to renal function is not well defined, especially among
individuals with mild to moderate chronic renal
insufficiency (CRI).
Methods. We analysed the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III;
1988­1994) data for 14 722 adults aged P17 years with
measurements of serum creatinine and all electrolytes
including ionized calcium. General linear models were
used to determine the relationship between mean
concentrations of electrolytes and different levels of
Cockcroft­Gault creatinine clearance (CrCl). Sample
weights were used to produce weighted regression
parameters.
Results. Changes in mean serum phosphorus and
potassium concentration were evident at relatively
modest reductions in CrCl (around 50 to 60 mlumin).
Changes in the anion gap and mean levels of ionized
calcium and bicarbonate were not apparent until CRI
was advanced (CrCl O20 mlumin). For example, com-
pared with women with CrCl )80 mlumin, those with
CrCl 60­50, 50­40, 40­30, 30­20 and O20 mlumin had
mean serum phosphorus concentrations that were
higher by 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.8 mgudl (all
P-0.05), and mean serum potassium concentrations
that were higher by 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mmolul
(all P-0.05), respectively. These changes were inde-
pendent of dietary intake and the use of angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Conclusions. Increases in serum phosphorus and
potassium levels are apparent even among people
with mild to moderate CRI. These findings should be
broadly generalizable to the larger CRI population in
the United States. Subtle elevations in serum phos-
phorus might contribute to the initiation and main-
tenance of secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is
known to occur in mild to moderate CRI.

Introduction
There is increasing interest in understanding and
treating the consequences of mild to moderate
chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), defined by a reduced
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) not requiring renal
replacement therapy [1]. Given that 6.2 million
Americans are estimated to have serum creatinine
(Cr) P1.5 mgudl [2], the consequences of CRI may
have important public health implications. We recently
estimated that in the United States (US), 800 000
adults suffer from CRI-associated anaemia, defined by
a haemoglobin concentration -11 gudl [3].
In addition to decreased haemoglobin, reduced renal
function is associated with a variety of biochemical
abnormalities reflected by changes in serum concentra-
tions of calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate and potas-
sium. However, the extent of these changes and their
magnitude in relation to renal function is not well
defined, especially among persons with mild to
moderate CRI. Currently, our knowledge is derived
mostly from studies of relatively small numbers of
individuals observed under carefully controlled condi-
tions (such as in a clinical research centre) [4,5] or
from CRI subjects recruited from outpatient nephro-
logy practices [6,7]. To what extent these findings can
be generalized to people with CRI in the general
population is unclear.
Taking advantage of the nationally representative
data collected in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we
aimed to quantify the relationship between levels of

renal function and serum concentrations of calcium,
phosphorus, bicarbonate and potassium. We hypothes-
ized that differences in one or more of these serum
chemistries would be evident at different levels of
renal function, even among individuals with mild to
moderate CRI.
Subjects and methods
NHANES III population
The design and operation of NHANES III has been
described previously [2,8,9] (data downloaded from
http:uuwww.cdc.govunchsuaboutumajorunhanesunh3data.htm#
Data Files 1a). Briefly, NHANES III provides cross-
sectional, nationally representative data on the health and
nutritional status of the civilian, non-institutionalized US
population. From 1988 to 1994, 39 695 people were selected
in a complex survey design and 31 311 were examined. All
NHANES III participants over the age of 12 years were
eligible for measurement of a biochemistry profile that
included serum chemistries and creatinine. Examinees report-
ing haemophilia or recent cancer chemotherapy treatment
were excluded from the venipuncture. We included in this
study only adults aged over 17 years who had a measure-
ment of serum Cr as well as all electrolytes including
sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, ionized calcium,
phosphorus and albumin.
Information on dietary intake was assessed in NHANES
III through 24-h dietary recall and on medication usage
through direct patient interview.
Assessment of renal function
Serum Cr was measured in NHANES III using the Hitachi
737 automated analyser (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) using a rate Jaffe reaction [10]. We
assessed renal function as the creatinine clearance (CrCl;
measured in mlumin) estimated from the Cockcroft­Gault
equation [11]:
CrCls$w(140 À age)3weightxu(serum Cr372)%
30:85 for females,
where age is measured in years, weight in kg and serum Cr
in mgudl.
The Cockcroft­Gault-estimated CrCl has been found to
correlate well with measured CrCl in a wide variety of patient
populations, including both adult men and women (correla-
tion coefficients 0.8 to 0.9) [12]. For the small number of
subjects without body weight data (0.2% of the sample), we
assigned sex-specific median values.
Measurement of serum electrolytes
Besides serum Cr, the NHANES III serum biochemistry
profile also included measurements of sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, albumin, total calcium and phos-
phorus using the Hitachi 737 automated analyser. In
addition, ionized calcium was measured using a NOVA
7q7 electrolyte analyser (NOVA Biomedical, Waltham,
MA, USA). The reported ionized calcium value was
normalized for serum pH, i.e. adjusted to the ionized calcium
value if the pH were 7.4 [10]. Between pH 7.2 and 7.6, the
normalized calcium value was calculated with the equation:
log wCaqqx7:4slog wCaqqxX
À 0:24ð7:4 À XÞ;
where X was the measured pH of the sample, [Caqq]X
was the ionized calcium concentration in the test solution,
and [Caqq]7.4
was the normalized calcium concentration at
pH 7.4. At pH 6.9­7.2 and 7.6­8.0, correction factors were
employed by the microprocessor to predict normalized
calcium values [10]. The coefficients of variation of these
assays were all in the order of 1­2% [10].
NHANES III examinees were asked to fast for at least 6 h
before examination. However, laboratory test results and the
duration of the fast were reported regardless of whether the
fast was held or not.
Data management and statistical analysis
Data management and statistical analysis were conducted
using SAS version 8.01 (Cary, NC, USA). NHANES III was
not a simple random sample of the US population and not
everyone had the same probability of selection. Appropriate
sample weights were therefore used to obtain weighted
regression estimates from the sampled population. The sample
weights also adjusted for non-coverage and non-response
[13,14]. It was thus possible to generalize the final results
of the analysis to the US population (although the dis-
tribution of renal function in the study sample is not the
same as the distribution of renal function in the whole
US population).
We adopted the same analytical approach as in previous
studies [3,15]. Individuals were divided a priori into eight
categories of renal function by their Cockcroft­Gault-
calculated CrCl: )80 mlumin (reference), )70 to O80,
)60 to O70, )50 to O60, )40 to O50, )30 to O40,
)20 to O30 and O20 mlumin.
Serum chemistries of interest were examined as the
dependent variable in a general linear model with age, race-
ethnicity and categories of CrCl as independent variables.
The value for age was that at the time of the screening
interview. Race-ethnicity was predefined in NHANES III as
non-Hispanic white (reference group), non-Hispanic black,
Mexican-American, or other. The other category included
all Hispanics who were not Mexican-American and all
non-Hispanics from racial groups other than white or
black. Analyses were stratified by gender. Ionized calcium
(normalized) was the principal measure of serum calcium in
our study. We also analysed total calcium and total calcium
adjusted for albumin by a commonly used formula, where
0.8 mgudl was added for every 1 gudl depression in serum
albumin below 4.0 gudl [16].
To assess the impact of dietary intake on serum chemistry
levels, we repeated the analyses, controlling for dietary
intake, for various nutrients as well as the duration of fasting
before phlebotomy. Dietary intake data were available in
14 233 of 14 722 participants (97%). To assess the impact of
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on serum
potassium, we repeated this analysis after excluding subjects
on ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs.
Finally, we determined the percentage of adults in the US
in the different categories of CrCl who had a serum
phosphorus level )4.5 mgudl, the upper limit of the
laboratory normal reference range.

Results
NHANES III population
Twenty thousand and fifty NHANES III participants,
aged P17 years, were examined. Among them, 14 722
(73%) had complete measurements for biochemistry
profile (including creatinine) and ionized calcium.
The characteristics of these 7835 women and 6887 men
are shown in Table 1. Since this study population is
not a simple random sample of the US population,
the prevalence of CRI shown here reflects not only the
prevalence of CRI in the US population, but also the
effects of sampling; older persons, Mexican-Americans
and black persons were intentionally over-represented.
These groups were subsequently weighted less in the
regression analysis in order for the final results to be
broadly generalizable.
Serum chemistries and renal function
We found a progressive increase in serum phosphorus
concentration among subjects with decreased renal
function that became evident as early as CrCl
50­60 mlumin (Table 2). In contrast, the relationship
between serum ionized calcium (normalized) and
CrCl was weak and inconsistent (Table 3). Only
among those with CrCl O20 mlumin was there a
trend towards lower mean serum ionized calcium.

Elevations of phosphorus and potassium in CRI
Serum total calcium or serum total calcium adjusted
for albumin were not lower at lower levels of CrCl
(data not shown).
Despite a significant increase in mean serum phos-
phorus, 2% or fewer subjects with CrCl )40 mlumin
had serum phosphorus concentrations above the
laboratory normal reference range. In contrast, hyper-
phosphataemia was evident in 3% (95% confidence
interval (CI) 1­6%), 7% (95% CI 1­12%) and 30%
(95% CI 0­62%) of subjects with CrCl 40­30, 30­20
and O20 mlumin, respectively.
We found a significant decrease in mean serum
bicarbonate only when CrCl was O20 mlumin
(although this reached statistical significance only
among women) (Table 4). Since non-bicarbonate
organic anions may accumulate with diminished renal
function, we also measured the anion gap, defined as
serum sodiumÀ(serum chlorideqserum bicarbonate).
As with bicarbonate, we saw a significant change in the
anion gap only when CrCl was O20 mlumin (Table 5).
The relationship between serum potassium
resembled that of serum phosphorus in that there
was a stepwise increase in its mean level among
subjects with decreased renal function, which first
became evident at relatively modest reductions in renal
function (CrCl 50­60 mlumin) (Table 6).
In general, the relationships between levels of CrCl
and biochemical parameters were similar in men
and women (P values for interaction )0.05). These
relationships did not materially change after we
adjusted for dietary intake of calcium, phosphorus,
potassium or protein (as proxy for dietary acid load),
or for the duration of fasting before phlebotomy
(data not shown). The relationship between categories
of CrCl and serum potassium persisted when we
examined only those individuals not on ACE inhibitors
or NSAIDs (13 082 of 14 722; data not shown).
Discussion
Increasing attention is being paid to understanding
and treating the consequences of CRI [17­19].
We have recently demonstrated in a large cohort
of ambulatory patients, and independently in
NHANES III examinees, that a decrease in haemo-
globin is apparent at more modest degrees of

renal insufficiency than previously realized [3,15].
Specifically, we found that a statistically significant
decrease in mean haemoglobin concentration was
apparent among men starting at Cockcroft­Gault-
estimated CrCl 60­70 mlumin and among women
starting at CrCl 40­50 mlumin.
To the best of our knowledge, the analyses reported
here are the first large-scale studies to quantify the
relationship between the degree of CRI severity and
its biochemical consequences using nationally repres-
entative data. Our results are therefore broadly
generalizable. We found that different homeostatic
abnormalities of CRI were apparent at different
levels of renal function. Changes in mean serum
phosphorus and potassium concentrations were evid-
ent at relatively modest reductions of CrCl (around
50­60 mlumin). In contrast, changes in other biochem-
ical parameters, e.g. the anion gap and ionized calcium
and bicarbonate, were not apparent until CRI was
advanced (CrCl O20 mlumin).
Our finding that serum phosphorus concentration is
elevated in people with mild to moderate CRI differs
from several previous studies [20­26]. For example,
Wilson et al. found in 12 CRI subjects (CrCl range
38­78 mlumin) [26] and Llach et al. found in 13 CRI
subjects (CrCl range 34­93 mluminu1.73 m2) [22] that
serum phosphorus was lower than in controls. This has
been used to argue that an elevated serum phosphorus
level is unlikely to play an important role in the
pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in
mild to moderate CRI [27,28]. Instead, the initiation
and maintenance of hyperparathyroidism was ascribed
to a deficiency in 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D [27,28].
However, the observation of low serum phosphorus
in subjects with mild to moderate CRI has not been
consistently documented [5,29­33]. Studying 51 CRI
subjects (CrCl range 5­91 mluminu1.73 m2), Pitts et al.
found a trend towards a higher serum phosphorus
concentration among those with lower CrCl [29]. Our
study confirms and extends the findings of Pitts et al.
Indeed, the large sample size and accompanying
statistical power allowed us to identify a specific
range of CrCl at which changes may first be observed.
This subtle increase in mean phosphorus con-
centration in subjects with mild to moderate CRI
suggests that elevations in serum phosphorus may
contribute to the observed increases in parathyroid
hormone at this level of renal function [29,34], even
when mean serum phosphorus concentrations remain
within the normal reference range. If so, since an early

Elevations of phosphorus and potassium in CRI
rise in serum phosphorus may not be accompanied by
a corresponding decrease in calcium (as would be
predicted by Bricker's `trade-off' hypothesis [35]),
other mechanisms may be involved, such as a direct
effect of phosphorus on the parathyroid gland [36].
The increased phosphorus concentration we observed
with mild to moderate CRI was independent of dietary
phosphorus intake or the duration of fasting prior to
phlebotomy. Therefore, these data do not contradict
the lack of postprandial rise in serum phosphorus that
has been documented among eight children with GFR
27­67 mluminu1.73 m2 [24].
Our finding that decreased serum ionized calcium
was not apparent until CrCl was O20 mlumin also
agrees with the finding of Pitts et al. [29]. Llach et al.
and Wilson et al. also found that serum calcium was
similar among those with and without CRI [22,26].
Martinez et al. had speculated that abnormalities in the
extracellular calcium sensor receptor might play a role
in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism
[33].
Our finding that changes in serum bicarbonate and
the anion gap were not obvious until CrCl reached
O20 mlumin is consistent with the literature showing
that `uraemic acidosis' develops only in the later stages
of renal insufficiency [37]. Our results differ from that
of Frassetto et al. who found that serum bicarbon-
ate level decreased with CrCl in the range of
80­160 mluminu70 kg [4]. Possible reasons for this
discrepancy include the fact that Frassetto et al.
analysed arterialized venous blood in 64 subjects who
were in a steady state and on a controlled diet in a
clinical research centre [4]. This method may be more
sensitive than the one employed by NHANES III.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that has shown statistically significant elevations in
serum potassium in patients with mild to moderate
CRI. These do not seem to be related to the use of
drugs known to cause hyperkalaemia in susceptible
subjects (e.g. ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs). The
physiological significance of this subtle increase in
mean serum potassium level (in the order of 0.1­
0.2 mmolul) is unclear. The associations between
reduced renal function and increased levels of potas-
sium and phosphorus are physiologically plausible.
These trends are consistent across the genders and
correlate with the severity of renal insufficiency (i.e.
stepwise worsening of parameters with lower CrCl
levels), and therefore probably reflect biological
relationships.
It is notable that we were able to detect these
changes despite the fact that various homeostatic,
compensatory mechanisms may be in play throughout
the course of CRI that serve to minimize changes in
serum chemistries. Of great importance among these
mechanisms are hormonal changes (e.g. aldosterone
promoting urinary potassium excretion, or para-
thyroid hormone promoting urinary phosphorus
excretion and calcium mobilization from bone). Our
results suggest that these adaptations are unable to
compensate completely for the decrease in GFR, as a
subtle elevation in the mean serum potassium level can
be detected in a study with sufficient power.
This study has several limitations that should be
mentioned. Only calculated creatinine clearances were
used; actual measurements of CrCl or GFR were not
made. However, the use of estimated CrCl typically
reduces misclassification of CRI severity compared
with the use of serum Cr [6,7]. NHANES III data
did not contain measurements of arterial blood gas,
parathyroid hormone, 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D and other
parameters that would have enriched our analysis.
That NHANES III examinees with mild to moderate
CRI have elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels
can only be extrapolated from previous studies
[29,34]. Serum pH was measured but not reported
and ionized calcium was reported after normalization.
Serum biochemistry profile was measured only once.
The day-to-day and even hour-to-hour fluctuations
in fasting serum parameters, which were probably
random, reduced the power of the study and led to
underestimation of the true clinical association. This
study was well powered due to the large number of
NHANES III examinees. Complete information on
potential medical interventions to treat the biochem-
ical abnormalities of CRI were not available, although
it is very unlikely that subjects with mild to moderate
CRI were treated except in cases of significant
hyperkalaemia. Despite this possible bias, elevations
in mean serum potassium levels were still detected
(and appeared to be independent of any dietary
manipulation). The exclusion of NHANES III parti-
cipants who did not have measures of serum Cr and
electrolytes led to slight biases in the survey weights,
but this was unlikely to influence our results substan-
tially. Finally, since this is a cross-sectional study, we
did not have information on how different biochemical
parameters changed over time in individuals with
progressive renal insufficiency.
In summary, elevations in serum phosphorus and
potassium were apparent even in persons with mild
to moderate CRI. These changes were independent
of dietary intake and the use of ACE inhibitors
or NSAIDs. Acidosis was not apparent and serum
ionized calcium was not reduced except among people
with CrCl O20 mlumin. These findings should be
broadly generalizable to the larger US CRI popula-
tion. Subtle elevations in serum phosphorus might
contribute to the initiation and maintenance of
secondary hyperparathyroidism that is known to
occur in mild to moderate CRI.
