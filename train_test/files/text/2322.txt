Missed Opportunities for Treatment
of Uncontrolled Hypertension at Physician
Office Visits in the United States,
2005 Through 2009
Hypertension affects nearly one-third of all US
adults and is a leading treatable cause of car-
diovascular death.1,2 National guidelines rec-
ommend prescribing new blood pressure (BP) medica-
tion for all untreated patients with an established diagnosis
of hypertension and for treated patients with stage 2 BP
elevation.2 It is unclear how often these guidelines are
followed nationally. We analyzed new BP medication pre-
scriptions for patients with uncontrolled hypertension
using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NAMCS).
Methods. NAMCS is an annual, nationally representa-
tive survey of all visits to nonfederal employed office-
based physicians who are primarily engaged in direct pa-
tient care.3 Using NAMCS data from 2005 through 2009,
we identified visits by nonpregnant adults with an es-
tablished hypertension diagnosis and elevated office BP
of 140/90 mm Hg or greater, seen by physicians who usu-
ally manage BP, including general and family practition-
ers, internists, or cardiologists. NAMCS records at most
8 medications; we excluded patients taking 8 "contin-
ued" medications because additional "new" (ie, ninth)
medications could not be assessed at these visits.
We measured new BP medication prescription (pres-
ence of a BP medication marked as "new" vs "contin-
ued" on the medication list) in our sample. We then
conducted multivariate regression to determine the in-
dependent association between new BP medication pre-
scription and age, sex, race/ethnicity, payer, systolic
and diastolic BP, patient-described visit reason, number
of "continued" BP medications, comorbidities, physi-
cian specialty and degree, primary and established care
status, and survey year. Finally, we selected the stron-
gest predictors from our regression model and plotted
their association with new BP medication prescription.
All analyses were survey weighted and conducted using
Stata 11 statistical software (StataCorp).
Results. NAMCS data from 2005 through 2009 in-
cluded 148 857 observations, representing 4.85 billion
visits. Of these, 16 473 (representing 662 million visits)
were made by nonpregnant adults with diagnosed hy-
pertension and a measured office BP, who were cur-
rently using less than 8 medications and seeing physi-
cians who usually manage BP. Of these, 7153
(representing 261 million visits; 41.7% of the weighted
sample) had an elevated BP. Among these visits, 19.5%
were prescribed a new BP medication.
In multivariable regression (eTable 1, eTable 2, and
eFigure; http://www.archinternmed.com), the stron-
gest predictors of new medication prescription were de-
gree of systolic (odds ratio [OR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.17-
1.31] per 10 mm Hg) and diastolic (OR, 1.23 [95% CI,
1.11-1.36] per 10 mm Hg) BP elevation; whether the pa-
tient stated BP to be a visit reason (OR, 2.57 [95% CI,
2.14-3.09]); and the number of current BP medications
(OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.37-0.56] for 1 medication [vs 0];
OR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.18-0.28] for 2 medications [vs 0]).
After dichotomizing BP elevation to stage 1 (systolic BP
140 but 159 mm Hg or diastolic BP 90 but 99
mm Hg) or stage 2 (systolic BP 160 mm Hg or dia-
stolic BP 100 mm Hg),2 we plotted the likelihood of
new BP medication prescription by BP elevation, pa-
tient identification of BP as a visit reason, and number
of current BP medications (Figure). New BP medica-
tion prescription exceeded 50% only among visits in which
untreated patients with stage 2 BP elevation identified
BP as a visit reason.
New medication prescription did not increase from
2005 through 2009 (P value for trend, .35).
Comment. Among patients with diagnosed hyperten-
sion who were seeing physicians who manage BP, nearly
60% had well-controlled hypertension. Among those with
uncontrolled hypertension, however, new BP medica-
tion was prescribed at just 19.5% of visits--with no im-
provement from 2005 through 2009. New prescriptions
were substantially more common when patients identi-
fied hypertension as a visit reason, but remained under
50%, except among previously untreated patients with
stage 2 BP elevation. Our findings are consistent with stud-
ies in more specific clinical settings4,5 and demonstrate
that the low likelihood of new BP medication prescrip-
tion for uncontrolled hypertension is a national problem.
We also found that patient self-identification of BP as
a visit reason more than doubled the odds of new medi-
cation prescription. Empowering patients to discuss BP
with their physicians through previsit forms, patient por-
tals, education, and incentives may be a way to achieve
better BP control, as shown in other studies.6,7
Our analysis has several limitations. Most impor-
tantly, NAMCS does not record medication dose; thus,
our study speaks only to new medication prescription,
not to overall intensification. If NAMCS physicians es-
calated medication dose without adding a new medica-
tion in the same ratio to overall intensification as in other
studies (1:3),5 the likelihood of intensification overall in
our sample would have been 26%. However, new medi-
cation prescription was often the only option (eg, among
untreated patients) or the best option (eg, low-dose com-
bination therapy for stage 2 BP elevation, which tends
to lower BP more effectively, with less adverse effects,

than dose escalation8,9). In addition, NAMCS does not
record the reasons new medications are or are not pre-
scribed; many (eg, white coat hypertension, patient pref-
erence, nonadherence, regimen complexity, and acute
competing concerns) might be clinically appropriate.
Despite these limitations, our analysis suggests that
missed opportunities for new BP medication prescrip-
tion are common in the United States. Taking advan-
tage of these opportunities could result in improved BP
control among US patients.
