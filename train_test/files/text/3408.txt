Introduction
Organizations are facing the challenge of how to achieve an
agile organization and a flexible workforce (Boxall &
Purcell, 2008). To be responsive to these challenges, organi-
zations need employees to contribute to innovation and flex-
ibility (Boxall, 2007; Dyer & Shafer, 1999; Unsworth &
Parker, 2003). A category of employee behavior that seems
particularly important in achieving these goals is proactive
employee behavior related to their own development and
career (Frese & Fay, 2001; Grant & Ashford, 2008; Parker &
Collins, 2010). We refer to this type of proactive behavior as
career initiative. Career initiative entails the self-starting of
activities related to learning and gaining experience in the
workplace, which include career planning and skill develop-
ment (Claes & Ruiz-Quintanilla, 1998; Seibert, Kraimer, &
Crant, 2001; Tharenou & Terry, 1998). These activities fuel
human capital, facilitate employees' careers and/or opportu-
nities for future employment, and are essential if organiza-
tions are to achieve organizational adaptability (G. S. Becker,
1964; Warr & Fay, 2001).
Research on determinants of employee proactivity has
hitherto mainly focused on individual dispositional charac-
teristics and job quality­related factors (Frese & Fay, 2001;
Parker, Williams, & Turner, 2006). Of all job quality­related
variables studied as antecedents of employee proactivity,
including career initiative, it has been consistently found that
the level of autonomy and complexity in the job is positively
related to such behaviors (Frese, Kring, Soose, & Zempel,
1996; Parker & Ohly, 2008). In jobs with higher discretion
and variety, initiative whether in task execution or in taking
steps to preserve or develop one's career is to a certain extent
inherent: it goes with the job. Any attempt at further enhanc-
ing career initiative should therefore show how it adds to
these well-known job quality effects.

Exploring the Relationship Between Job
Quality, Performance Management, and
Career Initiative: A Two-Level, Two-
Actor Study
Marc Van Veldhoven1, Luc Dorenbosch2, Anouk Breugelmans1,
and Karina Van De Voorde1
Abstract
This study examines how job quality and performance management influence career initiative in the workplace. Based on
signaling theory and the notion of internal fit in performance management and HRM, we argue that performance management
with a learning orientation further enhances career initiative, whereas performance management with a results orientation
constrains it. Combining the two performance management types is expected to diminish career initiative. In addition, we
expect the positive effect of job quality to be contingent upon the performance management types. A total of 772 employees
working in the (public) service industry or manufacturing industry and nested within 53 work units rated their job quality
(job variety and job autonomy) as well as career initiative. Line managers from these work units rated the performance
management types practiced. Results indicate that job variety and learning-oriented performance management positively
relate to career initiative. The positive relationships between learning-orientated performance management, job variety, and
career initiative are weakened when line managers simultaneously practice results-oriented performance management. These
findings underline the need to focus on how performance management orientations and job quality combine to influence
career initiative.

Although a need to study the impact of the wider organi-
zational context and the role of leadership has been expressed
in the literature (Grant & Ashford, 2008; Griffin, Neal, &
Parker, 2007; Parker, Bindl, & Strauss, 2010; Strauss,
Griffin, & Rafferty, 2009; Unsworth & Parker, 2003), little
research has so far addressed these issues. This lack of atten-
tion is surprising, because scholars have suggested that
organizational characteristics (such as Human Resource
policies and practices) play an important role in affecting
employee behaviors (Johns, 2006; Rousseau & Fried, 2001).
The few empirical multilevel studies along this line have
indeed revealed a number of contextual variables that influ-
ence proactive employee behaviors, including HR system
configurations (Batistic, Cerne, Kase, & Zupic, 2016),
change-oriented HRM systems (Lee, Pak, Kim, & Li, 2016),
and initiative-enhancing HRM systems (Hong, Liao, Raub,
& Han, 2016). These findings underscore the need for more
empirical research exploring the cross-level effects of con-
textual HRM-related antecedents on proactive behaviors of
employees.
Performance management, as enacted by line managers,
is a potentially important contextual determinant of career
initiative. This is the main instrument through which manag-
ers communicate their expectations of employees' contribu-
tions to the work unit, and/or their expectations of employees'
personal development (Aguinis, 2009; Boxall & Purcell,
2008; Den Hartog, Boselie, & Paauwe, 2004). In addition, as
a human resource allocator (Toh, Morgeson, & Campion,
2008), performance management signals, guides, and
rewards the desired allocation of employee resources to the
attainment of organizational goals (Bergeron, 2007).
Accordingly, we examine the role of performance manage-
ment in influencing career initiative. Performance manage-
ment can be practiced through various approaches, depending
on the goals management is striving for (Boxall & Purcell,
2008; Den Hartog et al., 2004). In line with earlier research
on performance management (Aguinis, 2009; Anderson &
Oliver, 1987; Dewettinck, 2008), we distinguish between
learning-oriented and results-oriented performance manage-
ment. Building on signaling theory and its application in
HRM and performance management literature (e.g., Bowen
& Ostroff, 2004; DeNisi & Smith, 2014), we posit that learn-
ing-oriented performance management facilitates career ini-
tiative behaviors, whereas results-oriented performance
management constrains career initiative behaviors. In addi-
tion, drawing on notions of internal fit (e.g., Delery & Doty,
1996) in HRM literature, we propose that the positive effect
of job quality on career initiative is contingent upon the per-
formance management type practiced.
This study extends previous research in three ways. First, in
line with directions for future research proposed by Grant and
Ashford (2008) among others, we contribute to knowledge on
the contextual antecedents of career initiative. We examine the
influence of performance management, as a relevant organiza-
tional HRM practice, and explore its interaction with the
inherent potential of a job to generate career initiative, as
derives from its job quality. Second, by including performance
management as enacted by line managers, we respond to the
Strauss et al. (2009) call for studies that focus on leader behav-
ior in relation to employee proactivity, like career initiative.
Finally, although the majority of extant research has so far
been restricted to the employee level of analysis, the need to
extend this research to multiple levels of analysis has been
expressed recently (Hong et al., 2016; Parker et al., 2010;
Parker, Van den Broeck, & Holman, 2017; Strauss et al.,
2009). By making use of a two-level, two-actor design, we
respond to this need. In our study, performance management
as practiced in work units is rated by line managers, while rat-
ings of job quality and career initiative are obtained from
employees.
Below, we provide a short review of the literature on
career initiative and performance management. Following
this, we introduce our hypotheses and explain the methodol-
ogy and findings of our empirical study. We conclude the
article by interpreting our results and discussing the limita-
tions and practical implications of the findings.
Theory
Job Quality and Career Initiative
Several concepts have been proposed in the literature over
the past 15 years that relate to employee proactivity directed
at development and career such as personal initiative to
develop (Frese, Fay, Hilburger, Leng, & Tag, 1997), flexible
role orientations (Parker, Wall, & Jackson, 1997), and
employability orientation (Van Dam, 2004). Parker and
Collins (2010), in taking stock of existing constructs and
measures in the area, suggest the term proactive person­
environment fit behavior for this category of employee pro-
activity. According to them, such proactivity aims to a
sustainable fit between the person and the environment. In
this study, we focus on a set of self-initiated activities that
concern learning and gaining experience to promote one's
career maintenance and/or opportunities for future employ-
ment (Warr & Fay, 2001). In particular, we study two main
career initiative behaviors: proactively engaging in skill
development and career planning (Claes & Ruiz-Quintanilla,
1998; Seibert et al., 2001; Tharenou & Terry, 1998).
Existing empirical evidence shows that employees work-
ing in high-quality jobs show higher levels of employee cre-
ativity (Oldham & Cummings, 1996), innovative work
behavior (Dorenbosch, van Engen, & Verhagen, 2005), and
proactive work behavior (Salanova & Schaufeli, 2008). Two
important aspects of job quality in this respect are job auton-
omy and job variety (Barling, Kelloway, & Iverson, 2003;
Grote & Guest, 2016). Job variety reflects the extent to which
a job offers a set of tasks that uses the multitude of skills a
person has, and as such also requires a certain complexity
and unpredictability in job tasks (Grant & Ashford, 2008).
Van Veldhoven et al. 3
Job autonomy concerns the amount of control or discretion
an employee has over major aspects, such as work method
and timing, of job performance. It is argued in the literature
that a broader job scope, in terms of skills and/or control,
encourages employees to know more, learn more, make
more connections between the things they know, and be
more creative in advancing alternative possibilities to
improve their own skills base--in short, to increase their
career initiative behaviors (Axtell, Holman, Unsworth, Wall,
& Waterson, 2000; Parker & Ohly, 2008; Parker et al., 1997;
Parker et al., 2006). Therefore, we expect that:
Hypothesis 1a (H1a): Job variety is positively associated
with employee career initiative.
Hypothesis 1b (H1b): Job autonomy is positively associ-
ated with employee career initiative.
Performance Management and Career Initiative
Performance management is a process that involves three
important stages: setting expectations and measuring perfor-
mance outcomes, tracing these outcomes back to the efforts
of employees and feeding this information back to employ-
ees, and finally formulating consequences in terms of
rewards as well as future employee work behaviors (Aguinis,
2009; Kinicki, Jacobson, Peterson, & Prussia, 2013; Latham,
Sulsky, & MacDonald, 2007). In line with recent recommen-
dations by Pulakos and O'Leary (2011), we focus on how
these performance management activities are implemented
by line managers on a continuous basis.
According to Den Hartog et al. (2004), performance man-
agement is the dominant channel through which line manag-
ers communicate organizational goals to employees.
Depending on the kinds of goals that management is striving
for (Boxall & Purcell, 2008; Den Hartog et al., 2004), differ-
ent types of performance management can be appropriate. In
the literature, distinctions are made between administrative
versus developmental, behavioral versus outcome, input ver-
sus output, developmental versus evaluation, and soft versus
hard performance management types (Aguinis, 2009;
Anderson & Oliver, 1987; Dewettinck, 2008). Based on
these available distinctions, we choose to contrast two per-
formance management types: results-oriented and learning-
oriented in this article. The reasons for this choice are
twofold: first, the contrast between results- and learning ori-
entation captures the common denominator based on the
sources mentioned above, and second, the contrast between
results and learning would seem to be highly relevant for the
kind of dependent variable that we are researching in the cur-
rent study.
Learning-oriented performance management is targeted
at achieving work-unit goals by guiding future employee
development toward those behaviors necessary to maintain
and/or improve work-unit goals related to innovation, flexi-
bility, and agility (Boxall & Purcell, 2008; Dyer & Shafer,
1999). Performance management with a learning orientation
focuses on stimulating professional growth, both horizon-
tally (within the same job) and vertically (to other jobs).
Given the emphasis in current organizations on constant
innovation and quality improvement, (continuous) profes-
sional learning and development has become a mainstay in
HRM for many workers, hence it gets a lot of attention in
performance management for many workers as well (Den
Hartog et al., 2004).
When a learning-oriented type of performance manage-
ment is enacted by the line manager of a work unit, we would
expect employees to be encouraged to seek opportunities for
development as well as to improve their own abilities (Boxall
& Purcell, 2008; Dyer & Shafer, 1999). In such a setting, the
performance management type is congruent with initiatives
by employees to behave proactively in job-related innova-
tion and creativity (Janssen & Van Yperen, 2004; Madjar &
Shalley, 2008). Career initiative, like other proactive
employee behaviors, typically involve a great deal of
resource expenditure as these require anticipation, planning,
and sustained action directed toward a future outcome (Frese
& Fay, 2001; Grant & Ashford, 2008), working extra hours
and taking on additional responsibilities (Bolino, Valcea, &
Harvey, 2010). Under learning-oriented performance man-
agement, time and resources allocated by employees toward
career initiative are not at the expense of negative perfor-
mance appraisals and their related consequences (Kanfer &
Ackerman, 1989). Summarizing, this type of performance
management signals (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Ehrnrooth &
Björkman, 2012) employees that career initiative is congru-
ent with organizational goals, and that actions directed at
development and career are valued by line managers in the
long run. This signaling theory builds on earlier work in
social psychology on situation strength (Mischel, 1977):
only situations that send coherent, consistent, and repeated
signals to people result in certain behaviors in a more or less
predictable way. In weak situations, no systematic patterns of
behavior emerge. In a related vein, the more a line manager
consistently emphasizes employee development by practic-
ing a learning-oriented type of performance management in
all three stages of the performance management process, the
stronger is the signaling effect of this enacted performance
management type (DeNisi & Smith, 2014). Frese et al.
(1996) empirically confirmed the importance of long-term
developmental organizational goals for engagement in per-
sonal initiatives at work. This therefore leads to our second
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): Learning-oriented performance
management is positively associated with employee
career initiative.
In contrast, results-oriented performance management
emphasizes the attainment of results-based goals and links
these with rewards to reinforce desirable employee behaviors
4 SAGE Open
and/or labor output (Den Hartog et al., 2004; Stiles, Gratton,
Truss, Hope-Hailey, & McGovern, 1997). As work-unit per-
formance becomes increasingly dependent on the efficient
deployment of human capital, results-oriented performance
management aims to direct employee effort toward the attain-
ment of individual performance results that conform with
work-unit goals in terms of labor productivity and proficiency
(Boxall, 2007; Tsui, Pearce, Porter, & Tripoli, 1997). This
kind of performance management is traditionally used with
low-skilled workers (Arthur, 1994), but in recent years it has
also become increasingly common with high-skilled workers
in both the private and public sectors (Aguinis, 2009), hence
also giving rise to many high-skilled workers being con-
fronted with the combination, for example, being confronted
with targets in terms of results and learning simultaneously.
When results-oriented performance management is
enacted by the line manager of a work unit, management
actions are aimed at shaping a work situation in which it is
clear to employees what it takes to be successful and pro-
ficient in the job, as well as providing structured and direct
feedback as to the extent to which employees behave and/
or perform in line with work-unit productivity targets (Den
Hartog et al., 2004; Stiles et al., 1997). Based on signaling
theory (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; DeNisi & Smith, 2014;
Ehrnrooth & Björkman, 2012), one can predict that--in
this context--employees are more likely to allocate
resources to adequately accomplishing their immediate
tasks and to task proficiency, at the cost of a long-term
proactive orientation toward changing work processes and
updating skills to meet future career demands (Unsworth
& Parker, 2003). This argument is in line with Bergeron
(2007), who also proposes a trade-off between the time
allocated by employees to task performance behaviors ver-
sus organizational citizenship behaviors. The short-term
focus of the immediate task takes precedence over the
long-term perspective of the career. Thus, our second
hypothesis becomes:
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): Results-oriented performance
management is negatively associated with employee
career initiative.
The Interplay Between the Two Performance
Management Types
Based on signaling theory, we have argued that learning-
oriented performance management will enhance career ini-
tiative, whereas results-oriented performance management
will constrain it. In organizational practice, the two perfor-
mance management types are not necessarily mutually
exclusive and can coexist in a work unit's overall HR
approach. Line managers can emphasize both achieving
higher levels of productivity and attaining higher levels of
employee flexibility and innovativeness (Boxall & Purcell,
2008; Quinn & Rohrbaugh, 1983).
Such a combination can be expected to send mixed sig-
nals to employees on how to allocate their efforts. This
relates to the notion of internal fit as is often used in the
explanation of HR system effects on employee behaviors
(Delery, 1998; Delery & Doty, 1996; Huselid, 1995). HR
practices will only have impact when they are coherent, for
example, correctly bundled together in a HR system, and
consistently enacted toward employees. Some bundles pro-
vide positive combinations while others provide deadly com-
binations (B. E. Becker, Huselid, Pickus, & Spratt, 1997;
Delery, 1998).
In our study, a deadly combination refers to a situation
where a line manager attempts to combine HR practices that
are detrimental to employee behaviors when used together. If
a work unit is already triggering career initiative through
using learning-oriented performance management, making
additional use of results-oriented performance management
is likely to generate confusion: Should I focus less attention
on the long-term and emphasize more my short-term profi-
ciency? The mixed signals may result in a deadly combina-
tion in relation to career initiative. Therefore, in our third
hypothesis, we expect that:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Result-oriented performance manage-
ment weakens the positive association between learning-
oriented performance management and career initiative.
How Performance Management Types Interact
With Job Quality
The argument of internal fit can be extended to not only
apply to HR practices or systems. Several authors have
emphasized that how employees behave toward strategic
organizational goals is simultaneously influenced by
whether HR initiatives have an internal fit with the typical
work systems chosen by the organization. Indeed this is
one of the ideas underlying the notion of high-perfor-
mance work systems (Appelbaum, 2000; Boxall & Purcell,
2011). Following this line of argument, if job quality is
high, a learning-oriented type of performance manage-
ment will demonstrate internal fit: The combination of the
two serves to further strengthen situational cues of the
appropriateness of career initiative. However, when in the
same high-quality jobs a results-oriented type is imple-
mented, a deadly combination may be expected, for exam-
ple, where the job itself would be conducive to career
initiative, the performance management system focuses
efforts on the short-term rather than the long term, coun-
teracting the inherent potential to mobilize career initia-
tive of the job. Therefore, in our fourth hypothesis, we
predict:
Hypothesis 4a (H4a): Learning-oriented performance
management strengthens the positive association between
job quality and career initiative employee career initiative.
Van Veldhoven et al. 5
Hypothesis 4b (H4b): Result-oriented performance man-
agement weakens the positive association between job
quality and career initiative.
An overview of all the hypothesized relationships is pre-
sented in Figure 1.
Method
Procedure
Data were collected from 12 Dutch organizations (four orga-
nizations operating in the service industry, four organizations
operating in the manufacturing industry, two governmental
organizations, one hospital, and one elementary school) to
boost the variance in our independent variables. For this
study, we needed access to and cooperation from line manag-
ers and employees in a range of work units. From the 12
organizations selected, 53 work units were willing to partici-
pate in the study. The average number of participating work
units per organization was thus 4.4 (standard deviation 3.7).
In the participating units, surveys were sent out to employees
to collect data on job quality and career initiative. At the
same time, for each work unit, data on performance manage-
ment orientations and on the number of employees per work
unit were obtained from the first-line managers responsible
for executing performance management. Face-to-face inter-
views were conducted on site by a PhD candidate and several
trained research assistants.
Sample
A total of 1,795 surveys were distributed, either on paper or
by intranet, to all nonmanagerial employees working in all
the 53 work units with the help of each work-unit line man-
ager or an external research institute. In total, 772 employees
completed and returned the questionnaires; a response rate of
43%. The average number of responses per work unit was
14.6, the number of responses per work unit ranged between
4 and 41. The sample includes both high- and low-skilled
jobs. The average age of the sample was 40.9 years (standard
deviation 10.5 years). In the employee sample, 50.4% were
male and 35.9% held higher vocational or university degrees.
The average number of contractual hours per week was 32.1
(standard deviation 9.1 hr/week). The average number of
years working in the organization was 10.8 (standard devia-
tion 10.2 years).
Measurement of Dependent Variable Career
Initiative at the Employee Level of Analysis
To measure career initiative we included five items. The
items of the career initiative scale reflect the degree to which
(a) employees set challenging goals and actively look for
situations in which they can expand their skills and knowl-
edge (skill development) and (b) employees are concerned
with and self-assess future skills and knowledge needs, as
well as take action to adapt to these estimated future needs
(career planning). The first item was derived from the Job
Aspiration Scale (Warr, 1990), the second and third items
were adapted from the Learning Motivation Scale (Taris,
Kompier, De Lange, Schaufeli, & Schreurs, 2003), the fourth
item was adapted from the Employability Orientation Scale
(Van Dam, 2004), and the last item was self-developed (all
items can be found in the Appendix). Items were answered
on a 5-point response scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 =
strongly agree).
Although for all items the full range of possible responses
is found, all items (and the mean score of the items) are skewed
to the right. To reduce the skewness of this measure, we
recoded the five items described above (score 1-3 = 0, 4 = 1, 5
= 2), and summed up the recoded scores. The resulting sum
score can range between 0 and 10 and shows an approximately
normal distribution across employees. The reliability of the
resulting scale is good ( = .82). A series of confirmatory

factor analyses (available upon request) showed that career
initiative is clearly discriminated from other kinds of work
attitudes and behaviors such as affective commitment, energy
availability, and task enjoyment (Bakker, van Veldhoven, &
Xanthopoulou, 2010; Salanova & Schaufeli, 2008).
Measurement of Independent Variable Job
Quality at the Employee Level of Analysis
Job variety was measured using a four-item scale taken from
a recognized Dutch questionnaire on the experience and
evaluation of work (VBBA; Van Veldhoven & Meijman,
1994). Employees were asked to rate their experience of job
variety, opportunities for creativity, and skill use in their job
on a 4-point frequency scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 =
often, and 4 = always). A sample item is as follows: "Do you
have enough variety in your work." The reliability of this
scale was good ( = .84). Job autonomy was similarly mea-
sured with a four-item scale from the same questionnaire
using the same 4-point frequency answering scale, again
with good reliability ( = .86). These items pertain to the
extent of autonomy regarding work methods and timing, and
are similar to those proposed by Jackson, Wall, Martin, and
Davids (1993). A sample item is as follows: "Do you have an
influence on the pace of work?" The two survey scales have
shown good correlations with observations by trained
observers (Meijman & Van Ouwerkerk, 1999). In addition,
evidence for the validity of these scales in relation to
employee wellbeing and health has been reported in several
studies (Bakker et al., 2010; Van Veldhoven & Broersen,
2003).
Measurement of Independent Variable
Performance Management Orientation at the
Work-Unit Level of Analysis
We used structured, face-to-face interviews with line manag-
ers1 that followed a predefined response format (see Neal,
West, & Patterson, 2005, for a similar approach). In the inter-
view, the performance management questions were preceded
by the following introduction:
The following questions refer to the way employees in your unit
are managed and motivated to do a good job. Basically, there are
two orientations: (a) managing worker input in terms of making
clear what employee attitudes and behaviors are expected and
need to be developed, and (b) managing worker output by
communicating clear performance expectations in terms of
results. Which of these orientations (learning, results, or both)
do you apply in your work unit?
When line managers indicated they practiced both kinds of
performance management orientations, six follow-up ques-
tions were asked related to the strength and quality of learning
and results performance management orientations practiced.
When line managers indicated that they only managed and
motivated using a single orientation, three follow-up ques-
tions were asked for that type of performance management
orientation (in this case, the three questions not asked--
because they related to a performance management orienta-
tion not practiced--were coded with the lowest possible
value). All of the line managers claimed to apply at least one
of the two performance management orientations.
Based on the notion that performance management is a
stepwise process, the questions covered the goal-setting
strength, performance review intensity, and extensiveness of
follow-up goal setting (Aguinis, 2009; Latham et al., 2007).
First, the "goal-setting strength" was measured by asking the
extent to which line managers involve organizational ("yes/
no"), team ("yes/no"), and individual ("yes/no") level goals
in communicating learning/results expectations regarding to
their subordinates. Second, "performance review intensity"
was measured by asking the extent to which performance
reviews with employees clearly provided feedback to what
extent the learning/results expectations of line managers
were met by employees. Finally, the "extensiveness of fol-
low-up goal setting" taps the extent to which line managers
raised their learning/results expectations in setting follow-up
goals when employees were evaluated as having success-
fully attained their current goals. The performance review
intensity and the extensiveness of follow-up goal setting
were assessed using a 5-point answering scale (1 = to a very
little extent to 5 = to a very large extent).
To create an overall index reflecting the two performance
management orientations, the six items with different answer
categories were recoded into categories of low (0), moderate
(1), and high (2). Goal-setting strength was determined from
the three yes/no answers and recoded as follows: three no's =
a low goal-setting strength (0); a mix of yes's and no's =
moderate goal-setting strength (1); all yes's = high goal-set-
ting strength (2). Based on the distribution of the scores, per-
formance review intensity was recoded based on the Likert
scale scores 1 or 2 = (0), 3 or 4 = (1), 5 = (2), and extensive-
ness of follow-up goal setting was recoded based on the
Likert scale 1 or 2 = (0), and 3 = (1), 4 or 5 = (2). An overall
index was then created by summing the three recoded items
on learning and on results. The range of scores for the two
indices covering the learning and results performance man-
agement orientation was thus between 0 and 6.
The reliability (based on the recoded items) of both result-
ing scales was good ( = .84 and  = .79 for learning- and
results-orientation, respectively). To investigate whether the
two performance management orientations captured differ-
ent constructs, we conducted a series of confirmatory factor
analyses. We compared a model in which all the items for
both performance management orientations were loaded
onto a single factor with the hypothesized two-factor model.
The hypothesized two-factor model fitted the data signifi-
cantly better than the one-factor model: 2(1) = 59.20, p <

comparative fit index (CFI) = .47; two-factor model: TLI =
.84; CFI = .91. These results support the discriminant valid-
ity of using our two measures. The factor loadings of the
items for learning and results performance management ori-
entations ranged between .53 and .97.
The 53 work units studied are nested within 12 organiza-
tions. Therefore, before proceeding further, we assessed the
extent to which the performance management orientations
differed between the 12 organizations. Results of two F-tests
showed that the variances attributable to organization were
not significant (p > .05). On this basis, we concluded that the
work-unit level was the appropriate level of analysis for the
performance management types, and did not include a third
level (the organization) in our analyses.
Measurement of Control Variables
In the analysis, based on prior research (Frese & Fay, 2001;
Taris et al., 2003; Warr & Fay, 2001), we controlled for three
individual-level demographic variables: gender (1 = female,
2 = male), age, and education (1 = lower education to 6 =
higher education). At the work-unit level, we controlled for
work-unit size as this could influence the instruments used to
align individual and work-unit interests (Snell, 1992). Given
that the survey research was targeted at surveying all employ-
ees working in the selected work units, we used the number
of distributed surveys per unit (which corresponds with the
number of employees per work unit) as our measure of unit
size.
Analysis
First, to examine whether job quality and career initiative
(both were measured in the employee survey) captured dif-
ferent constructs at the individual employee level, we con-
ducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses. We
compared a model in which all items for career initiative,
job variety, and job autonomy were loaded onto a single
factor with the hypothesized three-factor model. The
hypothesized three-factor model fitted the data signifi-
cantly better than the one-factor model: 2(3) = 1,914, p <
.05; one-factor model: TLI = .35, CFI = .46, root mean
square error approximation (RMSEA) = .21; three-factor
model: TLI = .93, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .07. These results
support our career initiative and job quality measures hav-
ing discriminant validity. Second, bivariate correlations
were calculated between all the variables measured at both
the individual level and the work-unit level. The data are
hierarchical (macro-micro) in nature as employees are
nested within work units. This nesting is likely to result in
dependency in our data, making multilevel analysis the sta-
tistical method of choice (Snijders & Bosker, 1999). To fur-
ther justify the application of multilevel analyses, we tested
whether there was sufficient between work-unit variance in
our dependent variable, career initiative, and indeed found
significant between work-unit variance (intraclass correla-
tion coefficient = 0.07).
We tested our hypotheses with a set of multilevel analyses
using MLwiN (Rasbash, Browne, & Goldstein, 2003). In the
first step, we included our control variables and the two job
quality variables after grand mean centering (H1a and H1b;
Model 1). In the second step, we added the two performance
orientations after grand mean centering (H2a and H2b;
Model 2). Following guidelines proposed by Baron and
Kenny (1986) and by Aiken and West (1991), the product of
the two performance management orientations was added in
a third step (H3; Model 3). Finally, we added the four inter-
action terms between the performance management orienta-
tions and the job quality measures to test the hypothesized
cross-level interactions (Aiken & West, 1991; H4a and H4b;
Model 4).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and correla-
tions of the variables under study at the individual (bottom
left) and work-unit levels (upper right). The two performance
management orientations do not correlate at the work-unit
level (r = .03). The learning orientation is practiced in the
work units at a slightly higher intensity than the results orien-
tation. Our dependent variable, career initiative, appears to
correlate with autonomy (r = .10**), with job variety (r =
.37***), and with education level (r = .15**), and these latter
two variables in turn are also strongly correlated (r = 30***).
Job Quality and Career Initiative
First, we assessed the main effects of both job quality vari-
ables on career initiative (see Model 1 in Table 2). Job vari-
ety is positively related to career initiative (t = 9.86),
supporting H1a. However, for autonomy (H1b), no signifi-
cant effect on career initiative (t = 0.05) was found.2
Regarding the control variables, only age is negatively asso-
ciated with career initiative (t = -2.25).
Performance Management Orientations and
Career Initiative
We now turn to the hypothesized effects of the two perfor-
mance management orientations on career initiative (Model
2 in Table 2). Learning-oriented performance management is
positively associated with career initiative (t = 2.02), sup-
porting H2a. No significant negative relationship between
results-oriented performance management and career initia-
tive is found (t = 1.00), thereby rejecting H2b.
Including the interaction effect of the two orientations results
in a significantly improved model, 2 = 4.71 (1), p < .05. The
product of the two performance management orientations has a

significant and negative effect on career initiative (t = -2.32).To
be better able to interpret this significant interaction, we plotted
the relationship between learning-oriented performance man-
agement and career initiative at low and high levels (one stan-
dard deviation below and above the mean) of results-oriented
performance management following the suggestion of Aiken
and West (1991).
As presented in Figure 2, when results-oriented perfor-
mance management orientation is high, career initiative is
high and not influenced by learning-orientated performance
management. Simple slope analysis confirmed that in this
case the relationship between learning-oriented performance
management and career initiative does not differ signifi-
cantly from zero (t = -0.07). However, when results-oriented
performance management orientation is low, the relationship
learning-oriented performance management and career ini-
tiative is significantly positive (t = 3.07). This indicates that
results-oriented performance management weakens the posi-
tive association between learning-oriented performance
management and career initiative. These results support H3
and are further interpreted in the discussion section.
To give an indication of the extent to which the perfor-
mance management orientations predict career initiative, we
calculated the reduction in unexplained variance in career

initiative as a result of adding the two performance manage-
ment orientations and their interaction effect at Level 2
(referred to as RR2 by Snijders and Bosker; 1999). From this
calculation, we conclude that the two performance manage-
ment orientations and their interaction together accounted
for an additional (above the effects of the control and the job
quality variables) 22% of the between-unit explained vari-
ance in career initiative.
Job Quality, Performance Management, and
Career Initiative
Including the four interaction terms (Model 4) did not result
in a significantly improved model, 2 = 5.12 (4), p > .05. In
fact, only one of the four interaction effects was significant:
the product of results-oriented performance management and
job variety had a significant negative effect on career initia-
tive (t = -1.97), indicating that the positive relationship
between job variety and career initiative is stronger when
there is low results-oriented performance management. No
such interaction effect was found for job autonomy (t = 0.81).
In terms of learning-oriented performance management, nei-
ther job variety nor job autonomy moderated its relationship
with career initiative (t = 1.10; t = -1.46, respectively),
thereby rejecting H4a.
To further examine the moderating effect of results-ori-
ented performance management, we graphically illustrate
the interaction in Figure 3 (Aiken & West, 1991). As Figure
3 illustrates, under conditions of low results-orientated PMO,
there is a stronger positive association between job variety
performance management and career initiative than under
conditions of high results-oriented PMO. A simple slope
analysis (Aiken & West, 1991) confirmed the positive rela-
tionship between job variety and career initiative under con-
ditions of low (t = 7.49) and high (t = 4.76) results-oriented
PMO. These results provide limited support for H4b, only
for job variety the hypothesis is confirmed.
Discussion
We have investigated relationships between job quality, per-
formance management type, and career initiative. First, job
variety is positively associated with career initiative support-
ing H1a. This finding fits the idea that a job offering a set of
tasks that uses the multitude of skills a person has encour-
ages an employee to know more, learn more, make more
connections between the things they know, and be more cre-
ative in advancing alternative possibilities to improve their
work or their own skills base (Axtell et al., 2000; Grant &
Ashford, 2008).
Based on previous research on employee proactivity
(Grant &Ashford, 2008; Parker et al., 2006), we had expected
job autonomy to also play a role in the linkage examined.
However, we did not find any support for this in the current
sample. This may be a consequence of the Dutch context,
where levels of job autonomy are usually high and to a cer-
tain extent institutionalized in workplaces (Boselie, Paauwe,
& Jansen, 2001) and where the national culture points to the
importance of control and discretion in the Dutch working
situation (Schwartz, 1999). Other studies using Dutch data
have also found that job variety matters more in the Dutch
context than job autonomy (Van Veldhoven, Taris, De Jonge,
& Broersen, 2005). In addition, the relationship between
autonomy and career initiative might be contingent on indi-
vidual dispositional characteristics, for example, the level of
self-efficacy of employees (Den Hartog & Belschak, 2012).
Second, the findings support the idea that under learning-
oriented performance management, employees are encour-
aged to seek opportunities for development. Based on
signaling theory (e.g., Bowen & Ostroff, 2004), we expected
that the more a line manager practices a learning-oriented
type of performance management in all three stages of the
performance management process, the stronger is the signal-
ing effect of this enacted performance management type
(DeNisi & Smith, 2014). In such a situation, career initiative

is congruent with performance management signals from the
line manager: It is clear to employees how they should allo-
cate resources (Janssen & Van Yperen, 2004; Kanfer &
Ackerman, 1989; Madjar & Shalley, 2008; Parker & Ohly,
2008).
However, the expected negative effect of results-oriented
performance management was not found. An explanation for
this finding might be that such a performance management
type triggers two counteracting processes. In a context where
employees are strongly managed toward results, employees
are likely to allocate resources to adequately accomplishing
their immediate tasks (Bergeron, 2007; Unsworth & Parker,
2003). Employees, however, are also likely to develop new
skills and competencies that help in coping with the com-
plexities and/or hindrances involved in meeting with imme-
diate productivity targets (Frese & Fay, 2001). In addition,
following the self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan,
1985), employees' need for autonomy and/or competence is
more likely to be thwarted in a situation where employee are
managed toward results, and this frustration might trigger
proactive employee behavior.
Third, the interplay between the two performance man-
agement orientations was explored based on the notion that
line managers can emphasize both achieving higher levels
of productivity and attaining higher levels of employee
flexibility and innovativeness (Boxall & Purcell, 2008;
Quinn & Rohrbaugh, 1983). Our findings indicate that in a
low results-oriented performance management setting,
practicing a learning-oriented performance management
stimulates employees to allocate resources to career initia-
tive. However, in a high results-oriented performance man-
agement context, career initiative is already stimulated, as
the results-oriented performance management may trigger
a coping mechanism to be able to achieve productivity tar-
gets. Simultaneously, deploying learning-oriented and
results-oriented performance management is not signifi-
cantly detrimental for career initiative. Although, in this
case the performance management orientations send
different signals, having both did not ensure even lower
career initiative.
As a final step in our analysis, we also explored how per-
formance management interacts with job quality. Results-
oriented performance management interacted in a negative
way with job variety but not with job autonomy. The positive
relationship between job variety and career initiative is
weakened when line managers practice results-oriented per-
formance management but still remained significant. This
suggests that high job variety is less helpful for enhancing
career initiative when a results-oriented performance man-
agement is practiced compared to when such a performance
management type is not practiced. No interaction effects
were found for learning-oriented performance management.
The combination of a stimulating job with high variety of
skills used and learning-oriented performance management
does not further strengthen career initiative. This finding fits
with earlier work reported by Neal et al. (2005) in a study on
HRM and organizational climate in U.K. manufacturing
firms, testing the so-called limited capacity hypothesis.
Based on their arguments we could argue that in our sample
the attentional and energetic resources that employees can
allocate to career initiative are limited. In so far as learning-
oriented performance management is able to trigger career
initiative, it is unlikely that such management activities will
achieve greater career initiative in employees who are
already allocating substantial attention and energy to this
kind of behavior because of the opportunities presented by
the quality and design of their job. Another interpretation is
that job quality mediates a link between HR practices (such
as performance management) and career initiative. Such an
HR process model (e.g., Boxall & Purcell, 2011) would
expect management that is steering toward innovation to cre-
ate better jobs for already highly educated workers, who then
display more career initiative, which contributes to more
innovative products and services for the company. Here, the
aim is successful delivery of innovative products and ser-
vices which will sustain the positive cycle described. This

scenario resembles what Hobfoll (2011) has recently called a
resource caravan passageway.
Limitations and Strengths
We have used the line manager as a single rater of the perfor-
mance management types practiced in a work unit. Gerhart,
Wright, McMahan, and Snell (2000) have shown that the
reliability of such a single rating for a unit-level variable is
likely to be low. However, they also showed that using mul-
tiple items for measuring variables in such a measurement
context does improve reliability, and we followed this advice
in our study.
We need to be somewhat cautious concerning our specific
measures of the two performance management types, and the
specific typology that we used. Due to time limits on the
interviews with line managers, only three items were used to
measure the two performance management variables. Other
researchers into performance management have focused on
the detailed steps, elements, and partial practices included in
this major area of HRM (Den Hartog et al., 2004; Fletcher,
2001), and might have chosen a diffrent typology. Our
approach has been to measure the main orientation of the
performance management activities as we deemed relevant
for our dependent variable, and this may overlook other
important facets involved in performance management, such
as contingent pay or procedural fairness. Our approach was
never intended to substitute for more elaborate ways of oper-
ationalizing performance management, but does seem ade-
quate for our current research aim (Button, Mathieu, &
Zajac, 1996; Parker & Collins, 2010).
A weakness in the research on employee proactivity is
that what we currently know about its antecedents is mostly
based on employee self-reported (Parker & Collins, 2010;
Parker et al., 2006) and therefore open to common source
bias. A strength of this study is that the independent and
dependent measures were collected from different sources
and on different levels, linking line management interview
data at the work-unit level to employee-level survey data.
However, we should recognize that multisource correlations
are usually lower than single-source correlations in research
(Doty & Glick, 1998). Nevertheless, considerable associa-
tions at the between-unit level were shown in this study: at
the work-unit level more than 22% of the variance was
explained.
Related to this point, it should be noted that although the
sample contained high- and low-skilled jobs, employees in
jobs where cognitive competence and continuous learning
are important are moderately overrepresented in our sample
(e.g., teachers, nurses, and engineers). This might explain the
relatively high scores on career initiative in our study, as
employees working in this type of job might be more willing
to self-initiate career activities. Previous work design
research also suggests the possibility of such occupational
effects. In occupations with high levels of cognitive demands,
employees have more opportunities for information process-
ing and problem solving (Dierdorff & Morgeson, 2013). To
understand these occupational influences on relationships
between performance management types, job quality, and
career initiative, additional research is needed explicitly
designed to compare these relationships in multiple occupa-
tional settings (e.g., teachers vs. assembly-line workers).
Finally, this study used a cross-sectional design in which
all the variables were measured at approximately the same
time. As such, no causality can be confidently attached to the
relationships established. Longitudinal research is needed to
confirm (or reject) the hypothesized temporal order between
job quality, the performance management types, and career
initiative.
Implications
This is one of the first studies researching the linkages
between job quality, performance management, and career
initiative. Implications and possible leads for research are
many; implications for practice are at the moment still mod-
est, pending further research.
A first implication for research is that more studies are
necessary that look into how career initiative operates when
management emphasizes performance in terms of short-term
results. Our results suggest a straightforward diminishing of
career initiative is not found in this context, and we have
offered a coping interpretation of any career initiative in such
a setting. A study directly addressing such a "career initiative
as coping" thesis would seem important.
A second research implication concerns how job quality
and performance management type combine. We found that
especially when jobs are high on skill variety, emphasizing
learning during performance management is likely not to be
adding much career initiative from employees (a limited
capacity view). The alternative interpretation we offered
suggests that high job quality follows positive managerial
decisions as to the job design and quality needed in a particu-
lar job to achieve proper performance. Employees repay
managers for such decisions by showing initiative and more
innovative and flexible work performance. In this way, cara-
van passage ways of positive resource exchange might be
stimulated between employer and employee. New studies are
important on these linkages, especially if they could pit alter-
native theoretical explanations against each other (Wall &
Wood, 2005).
For practice, our findings--if only modest at this stage--
inform the many organizations that are grappling with the
problem of finding and implementing organizational prac-
tices triggering employee work behaviors such as career ini-
tiative to achieve organizational agility and workforce
flexibility. More and more, this is also being recognized as
an issue for whole countries and economies, in the process of
global competition on the labor market and for a wealthy
future (Gratton, 2011; Macleod & Clarke, 2011).
12 SAGE Open
Following recent recommendations (Grant & Ashford,
2008; Parker et al., 2010; Strauss et al., 2009), our study
explored the cross-level effects of a contextual antecedent of
career initiative, and in particular we addressed an intermedi-
ate level and involved line managers who enact performance
management. We can offer as a practical finding that when
line managers emphasize a learning type of performance, this
is positively related to career initiative, and the same holds for
the level of variety in their employees' jobs. What line man-
agers do in this context apparently makes a difference.
Furthermore, there is a risk of mismatching the inherent
mobilizing effect of learning-oriented performance manage-
ment with an emphasis on short-term results. Having both
types does not ensure higher career initiative and appears to
hamper career initiative somewhat, so organizations may
want to tread carefully here. Finally, it appears that making
line managers spend a lot of effort on results-oriented perfor-
mance management is not always likely to pay off very much
in terms of career initiative, especially in employees holding
high-quality jobs. To summarize, performance management
as enacted by line managers certainly appears to matter, but
it pays to keep a keen eye on where it matters most.
