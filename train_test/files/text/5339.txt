Introduction
First reported by Hamman in 1939, spontaneous
pneumomediastinum (SPM) refers to the pres-
ence of extraluminal air in the mediastinum when
chest trauma, oesophageal rupture, hollow viscus
rupture, barotrauma, underlying lung disease,
and other disorders have been excluded
[Hamman, 1939; Crespo Marcos et al. 2006].
SPM is an uncommon disorder with an incidence
of 0.0025% among emergency room visits
[McMahon, 1976; Fitzwater et al. 2015]. SPM is
rare in paediatric patients; however, occasional
cases are reported to result from forced Valsalva's
manoeuvre due to cough, emesis, a first attack of
wheeze, or asthma exacerbations [Bullaro and
Bartoletti, 2007]. The first paediatric series was

Abstract
Background: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is an uncommon disorder. It is rarely
reported in paediatric patients and may be accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema. It is
usually benign and self-limiting, with only supportive therapy being needed, but severe cases
may require invasive measures. Asthma exacerbations have classically been described as a
cause of SPM. However, detailed descriptions in asthmatic children are scarce. We aimed at
improving the current understanding of the features of SPM and subcutaneous emphysema,
and outcomes, by means of a case report and a systematic review.
Methods: For the systematic review a literature search was performed in PubMed to identify
reported cases of SPM in asthmatic children.
Results: The case a 10-year-old asthmatic girl with SPM is reported. The patient received an
inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist, in addition to sublingual immunotherapy
(SLIT) with eventual control of asthma symptoms. Review: A total of 114 published cases
were found since 1995, most of them in teenagers; no sex differences were observed. Clinical
presentation was associated with an asthma exacerbation in a number of cases. Other
presenting features were chest pain, dyspnoea, cough, and particularly acute swelling of
the face, neck, and upper chest. Subcutaneous emphysema was present in most patients.
Overall, three cases of pneumothorax and two cases of pneumorrhachis were reported.
Therapy was mainly based on supportive care, rest, oxygen therapy, analgesics, steroids, and
bronchodilators. All patients recovered spontaneously, in spite of a small initial increase in
SPM in a few cases.
Conclusions: Early identification of patients at risk of SPM would avoid the high number of
under-diagnosed cases. Patients should be treated not only with supportive therapy but also
with measures to achieve control of the underlying cause (such as poorly controlled asthma).

reported by Thaler and colleagues in 1964 [Thaler
et al. 1964]. In spite of being rare, SPM is prob-
ably under-diagnosed in children. Two incidence
peaks have been reported; one of them in children
under 7 years of age, probably due to lower air-
ways infections, and the other in adolescents, due
to asthmatic exacerbations and high airways
infections [Lee et al. 2010; Reed et al. 2013].
Several studies have found a number of triggering
factors for SPM [Cicak et al. 2009; Lee et al.
2010; Maithani et al. 2012]. As shown by Lee and
colleagues, the most common ones are: lower air-
ways infection (43.2%), asthma (21%), oesopha-
geal rupture (5.4%), foreign body aspiration
(2.7%), and diabetic ketoacidosis (2.7%), with a
cause not being found in about 35.1% of patients
(idiopathic SPM) [Lee et al. 2010]. In recent lit-
erature, some cases have been reported due to
repeated scuba diving [Donoso Fuentes et al.
2009], spontaneous bronchial rupture [Maithani
et al. 2012], high-frequency oscillatory ventilation
[Hughes et al. 2012], influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection [Ozdemir et al. 2010; Patra et al. 2011],
drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symp-
toms (DRESS) syndrome [Giri et al. 2011],
hyperventilation due to anxiety states [Crespo
Marcos et al. 2006], and inhaled drugs such as
cocaine, cannabis, or ecstasy [Crespo Marcos
et al. 2006].
As a clinical syndrome, pneumomediastinum was
first reported in 1819 by Laennec, and its patho-
physiology was described in 1939 by Macklin
[Macklin, 1939]. A sudden increase in intra-alve-
olar pressure can cause alveolar rupture and a
leak of air resulting in interstitial emphysema. Air
may then reach the hilium and cause pneumome-
diastinum/pneumothorax, or may reach the lung
periphery resulting in subpleural bullae (ruptured
bullae may also cause pneumothorax). If leaked
air spreads into subcutaneous tissues in chest wall
and neck, through fascial planes, subcutaneous
emphysema occurs. Extension into the rachis
resulting in pneumorrhachis is rare but has also
been reported in SPM [Eesa et al. 2006; Girard
et al. 2014; Murayama and Gibo, 2014].
Clinical presentation includes the following triad:
acute substernal chest pain (90%), subcutaneous
emphysema (90%), and variably severe dyspnoea
(30%) [Crespo Marcos et al. 2006]. Other
reported symptoms are neck pain (20%) and low-
to-moderate pain on swallowing (20%), whereas
torticollis, dorsally-radiating pain, dysphonia, loss
of lung dullness, and paradoxical pulse are very
rare. Cyanosis, haemodynamic compromise, and
even an associated pneumopericardium have
been reported in most severe cases
[Kucukosmanoglu et al. 2001].
Subcutaneous emphysema refers to air being pre-
sent within subcutaneous tissue. Massive build-
up of air can even be life-threatening due to chest
compression, resulting in progressive hypoxemia
and hypercapnia. Substernal crackles synchro-
nous with heart systole (Hamman's sign) are
common (40­80%) [Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009].
Differential diagnoses include pneumomediasti-
num (though association is common), oesopha-
geal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome if
spontaneously developed), pneumothorax, hol-
low viscus rupture, chest trauma, foreign body
aspiration, and acute coronary syndrome and pul-
monary thromboembolism, both very rare find-
ings in paediatric patients [Cicak et al. 2009;
Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009; Reed et al. 2013]. In
clinical practice, diagnosis should be confirmed
by chest X-ray, including a lateral view to show
extraluminal air [Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009].
When the diagnosis is uncertain, chest computer-
ized tomography (CT) allows small amounts of
air in the mediastinum and tracheal injuries to be
detected [Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009;
Cremaschini et al. 2012]. If an oesophageal rup-
ture is suspected, an oesophagogram should be
obtained [Crespo Marcos et al. 2006; Cicak et al.
2009].
SPM is usually benign and self-limiting, with only
supporting therapy being needed; rest for 1­4
days, analgesia, oxygen, and clinical monitoring
[Crespo Marcos et al. 2006; Donoso Fuentes
et al. 2009; Cremaschini et al. 2012]. Underlying
disorders should be treated, if possible [Cicak
et al. 2009]. SPM usually resolves spontaneously
within 2­7 days [Donoso Fuentes et al. 2009].
Severe cases, such as tension pneumomediasti-
num or tension pneumothorax may require inva-
sive measures (e.g. subcutaneous drains) [Cicak
et al. 2009].
Asthma exacerbations have classically been
described as a cause of SPM [Hashim et al. 2013].
An increased airway pressure due to a chronic
inflammatory disorder appears to reduce airway
lumen. In children, SPM can appear with the first
asthma exacerbation or can appear later as a com-
plication of asthma [Versteegh and Broeders,
1991; Bullaro and Bartoletti, 2007]. However,
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(5)

reported frequency of SPM in asthmatic patients
is low [Lee et al. 2010]. In a series of 12,000 asth-
matic children seen at a paediatric emergency
department, SPM was observed in only 0.3% of
patients [Stack and Caputo, 1996]. In a series of
479 patients aged 1­20 years hospitalized with
asthma, SPM incidence was 5% [Eggleston et al.
1974]. Follow up of patients with SPM has shown
subclinical or clinical asthma in some cases [Dekel
et al. 1996], and asthma has been reported in
50% of SPM patients in a Taiwan series [Chiu
et al. 2005].
Recently, a large systematic review of 600 patients
with SPM, mostly young adults, was published
[Dajer-Fadel et al. 2014]. Previous asthma was
found in 13.7%; however, no specific data on
asthmatic or paediatric patients were provided.
Furthermore, very recently, a large series of SPM
in paediatric patients has also been reported
[Fitzwater et al. 2015]. In this retrospective
review, 96 children with 99 episodes were identi-
fied and their characteristics and management
were described; 38.4% were asthmatic. This will
be a landmark study in the field and includes
some specific data on management and outcomes
in asthmatic children as a group, although no spe-
cific description of such patients is reported.
Taking into account that detailed descriptions of
SPM in asthmatic children are scarce, we aimed
at improving current understanding of their fea-
tures and outcomes regarding both SPM and
underlying asthma, by means of a systematic
review and a report of a typical case.
Case report
A 10-year-old asthmatic girl attended the emer-
gency department with a persistent dry cough,
dyspnoea and severe chest/neck pain, after having
been exposed to environmental smoke and ash
after a recent fire. Family history: father with
asthma associated with sensitization to house
dust mites (HDM); two brothers (aged 17 and
13) with allergic asthma associated with sensitiza-
tion to HDM, olive, and Parietaria pollen, respec-
tively. Personal history: preterm birth (36 weeks)
and small for dates (2175 g). Hyperreactive air-
ways after bronchiolitis at age 9.
Clinical examination: no fever, 40 breaths/min,
135 beats/min, sat O2
97%, blood pressure 105/50
mmHg, sallow skin, bags under the eyes, and nor-
mal peripheral perfusion. Chest: inspiratory sub-
sternal retraction; reduced vesicular breath sound
and widespread persistent inspiratory/expiratory
wheezing in left hemithorax. Centrally-located
trachea, and heart sounds neither distant nor
shifted. Palpable subcutaneous emphysema
resulting in crepitus over lateral left neck area, left
supraclavicular pit and first ipsilateral rib. Asthma
attack was classified as severe based on a Wood­
Downes­Ferres scoring of 8 [Wood et al. 1972;
Ferres, 1988]. Laboratory tests: arterial blood
gases: pH 7.33, pCO2
51.6 mmHg, pO2
18.1
mmHg, HCO3
27 mmol/l, base excess + 0.6
mmol/l. Biochemistry: C reactive protein 20.2
mg/l; normal renal function tests and electrolyte
levels. Haematology: haemoglobin 14.7 g/dl;
white blood cell count 12.7 × 109/l; neutrophil
count 77.3%; platelet count 303 × 109/l. Imaging:
chest X-ray showed pneumomediastinum with
subcutaneous emphysema in supraclavicular and
left neck area with no pneumothorax (Figure 1).
The patient was admitted and received noninva-
sive monitoring, analgesia, oxygen (5 l/min),
inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol and ipratro-
pium), intravenous steroids, and omeprazole as a
prophylaxis for ulcus. After 72 hours, a chest
X-ray showed a substantially reduced amount of
gas in the neck and mediastinum. The patient
was discharged at day 4; prescribed therapy at
discharge included budesonide 200 µg twice daily
with AeroChamber, and she was advised not to
perform extreme physical activity to avoid pneu-
mothorax development due to potential bullae.

Prick tests for usual inhalants were performed.
Based on European Academy of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology recommendations, a posi-
tive test was defined as a 3 mm diameter papule
15 minutes after the test [European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 1993;
Bousquet et al. 2012]. Prick tests were positive for
HDM: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
(+++++), Dermatophagoides farinae (++++),
and for dog (++) and cat epithelia (++).
Pulmonary function tests: forced vital capacity
(FVC) 3.47 (104%), forced expiratory volume in 1
second (FEV1
): 3.12 (105%), FEV1
/FVC: 102%,
forced expiratory flow (FEF 25­75%): of 99% of
predicted by age, improving to 115% after bron-
chodilator administration peak expiratory flow.
Bronchodilator test was positive and fractional
exhaled nitric oxide (FeNo) using Mini Wright
was 37.1 ppb NO (normal < 30 NO). A nonen-
hanced chest CT excluded bullae (Figure 2).
Clinical course: A diagnosis of severe persistent
allergic asthma (allergy to HDM) was established.
Asthma control was not adequate with an inhaled
corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist.
Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with
STALORAL® 300 IR, containing a mix of HDM,
was added, which proved highly efficient, with
eventual control of asthma symptoms.
Literature review method
A systematic review was carried out in PubMed
to identify reported cases of SPM in asthmatic
children. Search terms were `spontaneous pneu-
momediastinum' and `asthma'. Only English-
language articles published after 1 Jan 1995 were
included. The search string was: (spontaneous[All
Fields] AND (`mediastinal emphysema'[MeSH
Terms] OR (`mediastinal'[All Fields] AND
`emphysema'[All Fields]) OR `mediastinal
emphysema'[All Fields] OR
`pneumomediastinum'[All Fields])) AND
(`asthma'[MeSH Terms] OR `asthma'[All
Fields]) AND English[lang] AND
(`1995/01/01'[PDAT]: `3000/12/31'[PDAT]).
Full articles were retrieved for those references
that included asthmatic patients <18 years of age
based on a review of titles and abstracts. A man-
ual search for additional references in selected
articles (snowball method) was also performed.
Articles providing a description of one or several
asthmatic patients <18 years of age with SPM
were selected. Data from reported cases were
abstracted and tabulated.
Results
Overall, 63 references were identified. A total of
35 were selected for full article retrieval and of
these, 17 articles complying with the inclusion
criteria were found. A total of 114 cases were
identified and tabulated (Table 1). Cases had
been reported from Europe, Asia, and the
Americas. The age range was 1­18 years, but
most patients were teenagers, with a similar num-
ber of cases having been reported in boys and
girls.
Clinical presentation was associated with an
asthma exacerbation in a number of cases.
However, in four patients, SPM was a sign of
their first asthma exacerbation or first time wheez-
ing. Other presenting features were chest pain,
dyspnoea, cough, and particularly acute swelling
of the face, neck, and upper chest. Subcutaneous
emphysema was present in most patients.
Diagnosis was most commonly achieved by
means of chest X-ray in older reports (sensitivity
89.1% in a reported series) and CT in most recent
ones. Lateral neck radiographs appear to be very
useful in doubtful cases. Most patients had no
complications, although three cases of pneumo-
thorax and two cases of pneumorrhachis were
reported.
Therapy was mainly based on supportive care,
rest, oxygen therapy, analgesics, steroids, and

subpleural bullae are observed.

bronchodilators. All patients recovered spontane-
ously, in spite of a small initial increase in SPM in
a few cases. However, in the largest reported
series, three cases of recurrent SPM were found
during a prolonged follow up. All patients were
discharged after 2­12 days, and a series compar-
ing asthmatic versus nonasthmatic SPM patients
showed no difference in length of stay.
Discussion
SPM is an uncommon disease that usually has a
benign course. It should be treated conservatively
unless a complication requires using invasive pro-
cedures. Although few cases of SPM have been
fully described in asthmatic children, our review
confirms that asthma, and asthma exacerbation,
appears to be one of the most prominent risk fac-
tors for SPM (Table 1). SPM has been reported
both as a consequence of an asthma exacerbation
and as a sign of a first asthma attack in children.
SPM may be associated with poorly-controlled
asthma. A majority of cases appear to occur in
teenagers and no obvious differences in incidence
have been reported between the sexes. Chest
X-ray is increasingly being replaced by CT to con-
firm diagnosis, whereas pneumomediastinum has
recently been reported as a sonographic mimic of
pneumothorax [Saracino and Tessaro, 2015].
Clinical course in reported cases has been gener-
ally favourable with spontaneous recovery being
achieved after hospital admission and supportive
care. Very recently, unusual cases of SPM have
also been reported in nonasthmatic children with
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [Anantasit
et al. 2015], a syndrome causing transient narrow-
ing of lower airway either in the presence or the
absence of clinical asthma [Weiler et al. 2010].
The usual course of SPM is spontaneous resolu-
tion after a few days, if supporting therapy is pro-
vided to the patient and good asthma control is
achieved. Recurrent SPM may occur in asthmatic
children, thus, from our point of view, careful
control of asthma appears to be particularly
important in such patients. Alpha1-antitrypsin
deficiency screening has been recently recom-
mended in patients with asthma and was per-
formed in our patient for differential diagnosis
purposes [Siri et al. 2013; Craig, 2015]. In our
patient, SPM and subcutaneous emphysema
were associated with severe asthma. Control of
asthma symptoms proved particularly difficult to
achieve. To our knowledge, this is the first patient
reported with asthma-associated SPM that has
been treated with SLIT. Our case suggested SLIT
could change asthma course in children and may
avoid potential complications such as SPM.
In conclusion, it is important to stress the impor-
tance of an early identification of patients at risk
of SPM, which would avoid the high number of
under-diagnosed cases. Moreover, patients
should be treated not only with supportive ther-
apy but also with measures to achieve control of
the underlying cause of SPM (such as poorly-
controlled asthma).
