Introduction
Gendered behavior is recognized by many social, critical and
feminist researchers to be the consequences of the cultural
norms and influences. To quote De Beauvoir (2012), one is
not born, but becomes a woman. This view is in direct con-
trast with traditional psychological researchers that tend to
attribute male/female differences to biological sex (e.g.,
Stewart & McDermott, 2004). This study, in line with the
former view, adopts the constructionist epistemological (e.g.,
Scott, 1986; West & Zimmerman, 1987) position, and
hypothesizes that learned preferences or classroom behav-
iors are socially determined.
There are numerous indicators within schools and society
that point to the fact that gender bias is present in the curricu-
lum and teachers' practices. Gender bias, according to
Sunderland (1992), operate at different levels in English as a
Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms: classroom materials,
English language itself, and classroom processes that always
interact within a particular political, sociolinguistic and edu-
cational context. Examples of gender bias are one gender is
substantially over- or underrepresented in a curriculum, such
as the stereotypical images of men and women present in the
textbooks; teacher expectations are related to or affected by
student gender; or classroom practices, teaching methods or
discipline disproportionately affect one gender (Dabiri,
2006; Fabes, Pahlke, Martin, & Hanish, 2013; Mehran, 2003;
Streitmatter, 1994).
Sadly enough, these seemingly unjustified gender
inequalities are at work in the educational contexts of many
countries in general (Ifegbesan, 2010; Lopez-Saez, Morale,
& Lisbona, 2008; Powell, Butterfield, & Parent, 2002; White
& White, 2006), and the EFL setting of this research site in
particular (e.g., Dabiri, 2006). Ifegbesan (2010), for instance,
explores teachers' belief and perception of gender bias in
classroom practices, and reports that educational system not
only reinforces traditional gender roles but also the stereo-
typed attitudes toward gender. Ironically, majority of the
teachers who hold gender stereotypes are unaware of this
fact and deny that they hold or perpetuate biased perceptions
of males and females in their classroom practices.
Classroom practices are classified into three different cat-
egories: those focusing on teacher-to-student discourse in

Gendered Teacher­Student Interactions
in English Language Classrooms: A Case
of Iranian College Context
Jaleh Hassaskhah1 and Sara Roshan Zamir1
Abstract
Being and becoming is the ultimate objective of any educational enterprise, including language teaching. However, research
results indicate seemingly unjustified differences between how females and males are treated by EFL (English as a Foreign
Language) teachers. The overall aim of this study is to illustrate, analyze, and discuss aspects of gender bias and gender
awareness in teacher­student interaction in the Iranian college context. To this end, teacher­student interactions of 20
English teachers and 500 students were investigated from the perspective of gender theory. The data were obtained via
classroom observations, a seating chart and the audio-recording of all classroom interactions during the study. The findings,
obtained from the quantitative descriptive statistics and chi-square methods, as well as the qualitative analysis by way of
open and selective coding, uncovered that there were significant differences in the quantity and quality of the interaction
for females and males in almost all categories of interaction. The study also revealed teachers' perception of "gender," the
problems they associate with gender, and the attitudes they have to gender issues. Apparently, while positive incentives are
able to facilitate learner growth, the presence of any negative barrier such as gender bias is likely to hinder development. This
has implications for teachers, and faculty members who favor healthy and gender-neutral educational climate.

whole-class work; those focusing on student-to-teacher dis-
course in whole-class work; and those focusing on learner
discourse in pair- and group work (Sunderland, 1992).
However, common to all is the idea of interaction that is the
part and parcel of any language classroom practice. Given
that one of the main objectives of Foreign Language (FL)
classrooms is facilitating interaction--usually via IRF struc-
ture (teachers' Initiate; students' Respond; teachers'
Feedback)--it immediately becomes clear that teachers'
manner of initiation can not only create more interactive
activities but can also prompt students to participate in all
kinds of negotiation of meaning (Xiao-yan, 2006).
Therefore, the ways in which teachers interact with stu-
dents prompted many researchers to study teacher­students
interaction in the classroom (e.g., Rosén, 2012). More spe-
cifically, the role of teachers in providing and distributing
equal interaction opportunities for all students regardless of
their gender, race, and social status was understood to be of
vital importance because they not only offer language prac-
tice and leaning opportunities but also help the process of
language development itself (Xiao-yan, 2006).
However, while in literature there exist numerous studies
on the content analysis of textbooks, curriculum materials,
gender-affected academic achievements (e.g., Wilkins,
2012), and gender-stereotyped beliefs and behavior
(Calvanese, 2007; Fukada, Fukada, & Hicks, 1992; Hoang,
2008; Jones & Dindia, 2004; Lopez-Saez et al., 2008;
Marshall & Reihartz, 1997;; Razumnikova, 2005; Riegle-
Crumb & Moore, 2013; M. Sadker, Sadker, & Klein, 2001),
studies focusing on the nature of interactions in classroom--
as an important arena for gender constructions--has just
started to receive the due attention (Dabiri, 2006; Rosén,
2012; Sunderland, 1998).
Dabiri (2006), for instance, indicates that the classroom
interactions between Iranian teachers and students are influ-
enced by teachers' attitude and expectations from genders,
and that teachers change their behavior, expectations, and
teaching style according to students' gender. Or Sunderland
(1998) examines the quality and quantity of interactions and
maintains that teachers vary considerably in the quantities
of interactions they have with individual students, with
males receiving a higher proportion of contacts from teach-
ers across subject areas. In other words, teachers initiate
more contacts with males than with females and males initi-
ate more contacts with teachers and they criticize and praise
males more often than females (Brophy & Good, 1974;
Jones & Dindia, 2004; M. Sadker & Sadker, 1994).
In addition, studies suggest that from the very early grades
through the university level, female students have been the
victims of hidden bias in teacher interactions and the curricu-
lum, although they sit in the same classroom and are expected
to learn the same material (M. Sadker & Sadker, 1994).
Streitmatter (1994) in her book toward gender equity illus-
trates the fact that the quantity and quality of teacher interac-
tions varies by student gender and through their interactions
they allow for male dominance in classrooms. Koca (2009)
also indicates that female and male teachers interact more
frequently with males, and this interaction is influenced by
gender-stereotyped beliefs of teachers and students.
There are also some qualitative differences in how teach-
ers interact with their students. This differentiation, on the
part of many teachers, has to do with expectations that are
largely based on the acceptance of gender stereotypes
(Dabiri, 2006; Streitmatter, 1994). Qualitative differences of
teacher interactions according to the gender of students are
generally manifested through the intensity of academic inter-
action between teacher and student.
Jones and Dindia (2004) in studying the role of student
gender in teacher-initiated interactions found that across
127 empirical studies, it appeared that female and male
teachers tend to have more interactions of all kinds with male
students than do female students. Kelly (1988) also in her
meta-analysis concludes that males get "more instructional
contacts, more high-level questions, more academic criti-
cism and slightly more praise than females"--all of which
would seem potentially valuable in terms of facilitating
learning. Due to the importance of higher level questioning
in effective teaching and learning, much of the research in
qualitative gender difference has targeted that direction
(Good, Sikes, & Brophy, 1973). Duffy, Warren, and Walsh
(2001) argues that the higher number of questions (especially
process questions) and feedback (acceptance and criticism)
given toward males could function as feedback and rein-
forcements for thinking by males; this signals to individual
that a certain way of thinking is correct or incorrect, although
not indicating the correct type of thinking. Thus, somewhat
more attention to males' thinking than to females' thinking
appears to be taking place in some classrooms. Duffy et al.
(2001) concludes that the tendency to interact more with
male than female students, besides other factors, also depends
on the academic subject being taught. It infers that teachers
hold higher expectations of males.
Considering that inequalities in classrooms may wrongly
decide who in general is empowered as a learner and unreal-
istically define who a learner is as a person, gender bias with
all its complexity and subtlety has to be recognized and con-
trolled in advance of every aspect of students' classroom life
(Streitmatter, 1994). Concerned with the issue, this study
reasons that students who do not interact with their teachers
are less likely to receive encouragement, chance to talk, and
hence learn--a threat that is recognized by Sternglanz and
Lyberger-Ficek (1977) as influential in determining under-
representation in postsecondary education.
Whereas many of the earlier studies indicated that gen-
dered classroom interaction could obstruct and even harm
knowledge acquisition for males and females (Yepez, 1994),
still little is known about how gender bias might affect sec-
ond language acquisition in adult EFL classrooms, and how
teacher's gender might affect teacher­student interaction
(Good et al., 1973). Moreover, considering that teachers'
Hassaskhah and Roshanzamir 3
expectations of male and female students are subject-sensi-
tive (Duffy et al., 2001), the other question that arises is
whether this "differential teacher treatment by gender" may
be manifested in the foreign language classroom, an environ-
ment in which females are generally thought to outperform
males (Sunderland, 1998). In the light of these questions, the
following objectives were postulated for this study:
1. To examine the differences in frequency and types of
teacher-initiated interactions directed toward females
and males.
2. To discover the differences in the frequency and
types of interactions directed toward females and
males between female and male teachers.
3. To assess teachers' attitude toward gender bias and
their awareness of their own treatment of male and
female students in class, because according to
M. Sadker and Sadker (1992) despite most teachers'
claim that they treat students fairly, irrespective of
their gender, research reveals the opposite.
It was hypothesized that due to the dominant sociopoliti-
cal attitude to women in this research context, which places
women under male guardianship (Moghadam, 2004), female
participants would be more likely to experience gender dis-
crimination in their classrooms.
Method
To meet the objectives stated above, the researchers required
only mixed-gender EFL classes, where considerable amount
of interaction between teacher and students would occur, and
from which comparable data of teachers' treatment toward
males and females could be obtained.
Sampling
The sampling technique had to be nonrandom and purposive,
because the accessibility of mixed-gender classes in a coun-
try like Iran, where the prevalent tendency is toward having
segregated classes, was heavily restricted. As a result, a sam-
ple of 20 teachers, 10 females, and 10 males from different
universities in Guilan-Iran, who taught "Basic English"
courses (Conversation, Reading, and Oral reproduction;
these courses were selected because they required sufficient
interaction and acted as the stepping stones for the students'
ongoing academic life), and 500 Iranian students (78%
females and 22% males; the proportion represented male/
female groups in the population) within the age range of
19 to 25 were selected to serve as the participants of this study.
Instruments
The main sources of data collection for this study were class-
room observation and teacher interviews. In general,
classroom observation procedures are grouped into three
major categories: (a) those that focus on the teacher, (b) those
that focus on the teacher­student dyad, and (c) those that
focus on the student (Lockheed & Harris, 1989). However, in
line with the objectives of this study, that of the second type
(i.e., focusing on teacher­student interactions) was used
which took the form of quantitative systematic observations
and qualitative note taking, and mainly focused on the
teacher-initiated interactions.
The tools used for this kind of observation consisted of a
modified version of gender-equity observation checklist
(INTERSECT observation instrument) developed by Sadker
(cited in D. Sadker, Sadker, & Bauchner, 1984) to systemati-
cally observe classroom interactions, and a seating chart to
keep a sound record of frequency and type of teacher­student
interactions and to quantify the classroom behavior observed.
The gender-equity observation checklist aids in the con-
version of general classroom interactions into evaluative
types of interactions: praise, criticism, remediation, and
acceptance. Using this observation tool to collect data on fre-
quency and pattern of teacher-initiated interactions to stu-
dents, the researchers deliberately recorded only the
interactions between teachers and individual students and
overlooked those between teachers and the class as a whole
and between student and student or student to teacher. In
addition, the seating chart that was constructed for this
research purpose was used as the means for observation and
codification of the observed data. The chart consisted of
square boxes to represent the location and gender of each
student, as well as the teacher's in the classroom.
A code was assigned to each category in the checklist, and
on the occurrence of each of the categories, and the specified
code was recorded on the seating chart. Codes were used to
represent teacher and students behavior.
Besides coding the interactions based on the prespecified
checklist, interactions were also audio-recorded for later veri-
fication of the coded data. Of course, video-taping the classes
would have been much more preferable in these situations;
however, as that was not allowed in the observed classes,
audio-recording alone was used. The audio-recording was
very helpful in categorizing the types of interactions observed.
Intraobserver reliability.To gain experience with the use of
coding chart and to test the intraobserver reliability, a pilot
study, which was not used in the main study, was conducted.
Although using only one coder eliminated the problem of
interobserver agreement, there remained the possibility of
individual observer coding bias (Patton, 1990). Conse-
quently, three randomly selected classes of the pilot study
were simultaneously coded by another observer as a check
on observer reliability. The Cohen's kappa was calculated to
show the overall agreement for the observers' coding among
four evaluative type of interaction during the pilot study. The
index obtained was .79, which according to Landis and Koch
(1977) was substantial.

Procedures
Observation.To observe the ethical requirements of the
study, the participant teachers were asked for their permis-
sion to allow one of the researchers to visit their classes at
least 3 times in an academic term--As a result, 60 classes
were totally observed. Moreover, they were informed that
the researchers would need to have a follow-up interview for
which their further cooperation might be required. It should
be noted that due to the nature of the investigation, the main
goal of the study (gender equity) was deliberately withheld
to prevent teachers' dog-and-pony show and as a result a
change in classroom dynamics. Moreover, codes were
assigned to names to maintain participants' confidentiality.
Having done so, the observer regularly entered every class-
room prior to the arrival of the students and sat in an unob-
trusive position near the back and side of the room to be able
to have a better grasp of the whole setting and to observe all
and every students and their teachers. The seating arrange-
ment of the class was drawn and labeled with the students'
name (if possible), gender, and any other needed informa-
tion. Generally the average class size was 23 students. In
most classes, males and females sat in a rectangular format,
with the teacher in front. Students' desks were more fre-
quently arranged in rows of 4 or 6, and there was no decora-
tion on the walls.
Students in all classrooms sat in gender-differentiated pat-
tern--females mostly sitting in front rows and males in last
rows, or females on one side and males on the other side of
the class. Teacher's position was also identified to examine
his or her action zone--the section he or she was mostly fac-
ing or projecting in a discussion--because this is suggested
to be influential in the learning experience of the students
(D. Sadker et al., 1984).
The observer recorded every teacher-initiated interactions
that occurred between a teacher and a student based on a
prespecified checklist and on the seating chart. Moreover, to
prevent the loss of any piece of the data, a high quality
recorder was used to audio record the interactions. In addi-
tion, some field notes besides coding the interactions were
also taken on classroom setup, teacher talk, and teacher
behavior in class to help the researchers have an ongoing
analysis of the data, and as a result a better understanding of
teacher behavior in class to see if they signal the promotion
of any sort of gender inequity in the classrooms.
Finally, all classes were continuously observed 3 times
within 90-min class periods, yielding a total observation time
of 90 hr to get a typical sample of teacher­student interac-
tions and to be able to generalize the findings. The number of
students present during all the class observations carried out
in this study was 500 (392 females and 108 males), and that
of teachers was 20 (10 females and 10 males).
Interview.A sample of two thirds of the observed teachers
(six teachers, three females and three males) was randomly
selected for the interview. Having completed the
observations, and before posing the interview questions, the
teachers to be interviewed were informed about the main
concern of the study, after then were asked two sets of ques-
tions: (a) relevant demographical questions and (b) three
open-ended questions to assess how they perceived their
behavior toward male/female students, and their interaction
patterns in the classroom.
Permission was obtained orally from each respondent to
record the interview and they were assured that their answers
would be kept confidential; codes were used to protect ano-
nymity of the participants. To have a better ability to com-
pare the responses, all the questions asked in the interview
process were structured and preplanned, and whenever the
interviewees were not clear with the questions, they were
freely offered clarifications and explanations by the inter-
viewer. Notes were taken on their responses to every ques-
tion. The whole interview was audio-recorded and then
transcribed for further analysis.
Data Analysis
For the quantitative data, descriptive statistics of the overall
patterns of classroom interaction was calculated and the cor-
responding counts were tallied for the categories and orga-
nized into tables for easy reference. In the second phase of
analysis, to examine the statistical difference in teacher inter-
action with males and females; that is to determine if a sig-
nificant difference existed between teachers and their
interactions with male/female students, the chi-square statis-
tic was run to compare the tallies or counts of categorical
teacher interaction with males and females. It should be
noted that only actual numbers and not percentages were
used for this purpose.
For the analysis of the qualitative data, the constant com-
parative method of qualitative analysis (Patton, 1990) was
used. That is, all interviews were recorded in the researchers'
field notes. The audio-recording of the interviews was then
transcribed and later, the researchers systematically worked
through each transcript of the interviews and the notes taken
during classroom observations to assign codes to the specific
characteristics within the texts. After the open coding the
researchers looked for themes in the data that could be sorted
into categories. To ensure that naturally arising categories
were used rather than those the researchers might have hoped
to locate and to substantiate, an assistant rechecked the data
and the classification system for the appropriateness and
accuracy of the categories as well as the data placement in
these categories.
Results
Quantitative Results
In the 20 classes observed, a total of 1,270 teacher-initiated
interactions were recorded. Then, the total number of teacher
to student interactions was broken down into four categories
Hassaskhah and Roshanzamir 5
of contact: praise, acceptance, remediation, and criticism.
The ratio of each type of contact to the total was further com-
puted to represent the distributions of interactions. Table 1
summarizes the frequency and percentage of teacher-initi-
ated interactions regardless of teacher gender in each cate-
gory of interaction.
As illustrated in the table, of four types of contacts speci-
fied in this study, teachers mostly provided students with
acceptance (comments which implied that student perfor-
mance was correct or appropriate) in response to the ques-
tions asked by the teachers themselves. Thus, acceptance
was, by far, the largest type of feedback used by teachers
(56%); followed by praise (21%; Explicit comments which
positively reinforced student performance), then remediation
(14%; A constructive teacher comment, usually encouraging
or cueing a more acceptable student response), and finally
criticism (explicitly negative teacher evaluation) that
accounted for only 9% of the interactions.
Teacher-initiated interactions and students' gender. This part is
done in response to the first objective of the study; that is,
examining the differences in the frequency of interaction
directed toward males and females. To this end, the break-
down of the number of females and males in the observed
classes, the total number of each interaction type, the quan-
tity of the observed interactions by student gender, and the
quantities of interactions that would have been expected,
prorated for the numbers of females and males in the study
are shown in Table 2. To account for the uneven distribution
of females and males in the observed classes the expected
frequency of the interactions was calculated based on the
ratio of females and males in all the observed classes. Con-
sidering the ratio of females and males in the observed
classes it would have been expected that in each interaction
category 78% of the interactions be distributed among
females and 22% of them among males.
As can be seen from Table 2, in all interaction categories
the total interactions distributed to males were more than
what would have been expected proportional to their num-
bers. In general, if we consider the uneven distribution of
females and males in the class it is revealed that although
females constituted 78% of the total sample (392 females,
108 males), they accounted for only 33% of the total interac-
tions (819 out of 1,270).
In the next phase of analysis, the one-dimensional chi-
square was conducted to determine if there was any signifi-
cant difference in the distribution of each interaction category
between females and males. The analysis revealed a signifi-
cant difference in the distribution of all the specified catego-
ries of interactions directed by female and male teachers
toward female and male students, except for remediation. In
other words, there was no significant difference in the distri-
bution of remediation between females and males (2 =
2.688; df = 1; p < .05). All the other interaction categories
were distributed significantly more among males (Table 2).
The chi-square measures of all the categories are presented
in Table 2 (df = 1; p < .05).
Types of teacher­student interactions directed toward females
and males and teachers' gender. This part of the quantitative
analysis contributes to the second objective of the study
which is concerned with the issue of the differences in fre-
quency and types of interaction directed toward female and
male students between female and male teachers.
To meet this end, the observed frequency of teacher­stu-
dent interactions initiated by female and male teachers toward
female and male students was counted (Table 3). For ease of
comparison, the quantities of interactions that would have
been expected to be directed toward students of either gender
by female and male teachers, proportional to students' enroll-
ment in their classes, are presented in Table 4. Comparing the
observed frequency of the different types of contact initiated
by female and male teachers with the expected frequency of
these types of interactions, it is clear that all categories of
interaction were consistently directed toward males more
than what would have been expected proportional to their
enrollment in class by female and male teachers. To test the
differences in frequency and types of teacher-initiated inter-
actions directed toward female and male students between
female and male teachers, a chi-square test of independence
was performed for each category of interactions.
Results of the analysis revealed that female teachers
directed significantly more acceptance (2 = 28.419; df = 1;
p < .05) and praise (2 = 5.158; df = 1; p < .05) toward males
than toward females. Yet, there was no significant difference
in female teacher-initiated remediation (2 = 0.6; df = 1;
p < .05) and criticism (2 = 2.111; df = 1; p < .05) directed
toward female and male students. However, in the classes of
male teachers the results of the analysis manifested that sig-
nificantly more acceptance (2 = 63.379; df = 1; p < .05),
praise (2 = 50.921; df = 1; p < .05), and criticism (2 = 8.41;
df = 1; p < .05) were directed toward males than females.
However, there was no significant difference in remediation
that male teachers directed toward females and males
(2 = 2.152; df = 1; p < .05). Tables 3 and 4 present the
observed and expected frequencies of different categories of
feedback directed toward females and males between female
and male teachers, respectively.

Qualitative results.This last section presents the results
obtained through interview to assess teachers' awareness of
how they treated male/female students in their classrooms.
Six teachers (three females and three males) were randomly
chosen from among the observed teachers to be interviewed.
The interview contained three open-ended questions as
follows:
1. Do you see any difference between females and
males in your class that makes you treat them
differently?
2. Do you think the type of feedback that you give to
females and males are the same or different?
3. What do you think would be the likely cause of any
unequal distribution of the interaction patterns in
your classroom?
All the teachers interviewed had similar if not the same
answers to the interview questions. When teachers were
asked whether they saw any differences between females and
males in their classes, almost all of them (83%) explicitly
stated that they did not see any difference regarding gender
of the students; however, in elaborating their answers 67% of
teachers stated that females were more participating in the
classroom. They believed that females compared with males
took part more in activities and interacted more with the
teacher. Teachers' comments as stated by they themselves
and without any modification appear below:
Females like to talk a lot, even participate more in activities and
more question and answer happen. Males mostly try just to keep
silent and when they are asked they take part. (Teacher J, male)
However, one teacher had a different view in this regard:
. . . sometimes male students participate more in class so they
take more attention but the others not . . . (Teacher H, female)
Another teacher points to students' level of achievement
as the source of students' difference and not their gender:

The only difference between students is determined by their
level. (Teacher P, female)
Concerning the type of feedback directed toward females
and males 83% of the teachers stated that the type of feed-
back did not depend on the gender and in this regard they did
not consider any difference between females and males.
Some of them further explained that type of their feedback
depended on the personality of the student.
The type of feedback is not based on gender; it depends on the
personality of the students. I do not think that females are more
sensitive than males. You can see some males that are very
sensitive. And because the number of males is few in class,
when you criticize them in front of all females it will offend
them too much sometimes. (Teacher D, female)
Mostly I disregard the difference between females and males but
if I feel the student is bothered with my feedback I try to mend it
and mostly females are more sensitive to those matters. (Teacher
J, male)
Personality of the students determines the kind of feedback.
(Teacher N, male)
One of the teachers referred to the type of answer as the
determining factor:
It depends on the type of answer I receive regardless of any
gender consideration. (Teacher H, female)
Only one teacher claimed that he was "more careful in
treating females."
. . . they [females] are much more emotional. So you should be
careful when directing criticism or remediation toward them.
We are supposed to be alert in providing feedback to females.
We criticize the females but in a polite way not to offend them.
Of course, it depends most of the time on them being obedient or
not, otherwise we have to use direct words. We treat males
politely too but the selection of the words and the way we
provide the feedback is different. (Teacher O, male)
In asking the teachers' opinion about the cause of any
likely unequal distribution of interaction between females
and males, they provided various answers. Among the men-
tioned causes were: students' voluntary participation (50%),
gap between teaching and practice (17%), the classroom
context (50%), teacher characteristics (17%), and student's
knowledge (33%). Below are some of the comments from
the teachers interviewed:
Maybe the level of participation of that gender caused it. Some
students just grab the teachers' attention . . . (Teacher H, female)
It is my failure and I accept it, but maybe more volunteers from
one gender are the cause because mostly I put a question and
choose from volunteers to answer. (Teacher J, male)
The cause is the gap between practice and thinking. Always
there is a gap between the teacher concept before coming to
class and something that happens in the class. The second factor
may be the context of the class. (Teacher N, male)
It depends on someone's temperament and characteristics. Some
men are more comfortable with male students and some with
female students. (Teacher O, male)
It depends on the knowledge they have. Among the students at
the same level I do not put any difference in the type of asked
questions but for both students that are in higher level or lower
level type of question would be different. (Teacher P, female)
Discussion
The quantitative findings of this study indicated that within
teacher-initiated interactions, three out of four categories of
evaluative contacts (acceptance, praise, and criticism) were
directed significantly more to males than females. Actually
males were involved in more than 50% of all the interaction
categories. The only category with no significant difference
in its distribution between females and males was remedia-
tion. Moreover, findings regarding the influence of gender of
teachers on their differentiated behavior toward females and
males exposed that female teachers normally provided males
with more acceptance and praise than females; however,
there was no significant difference in providing females and
males with criticism or remediation. However, in male-
taught classes almost all categories of interaction were
directed significantly more toward males.
Generally speaking, these results support M. Sadker and
Sadker (1994), Duffy et al. (2001), Jones and Dindia (2004),
and Koca (2009), and confirm that males get more speaking
practice and more feedback on their utterances. That is,
males responded more to the teachers' questions, and hence
received more feedback and practice in language functions.
However, in explaining the causes of female teachers not
providing males with more criticism and remediation, class-
room observations and teachers' interviews revealed that
Iranian female teachers were more cautious in criticizing
males, as one of the teachers said,
. . . maybe a boy is more sensitive than a girl, especially if we
have few males in class and when you criticize them in front of
all the females it will offend them too much sometimes. (Teacher
D, female)
Teachers' beliefs and behaviors in the classroom are most
probably influenced by the dominant bias that exists in
Iranian society. Actually, Iranian society assigns abilities and
characteristics to individuals on the basis of their gender
(Moghadam, 2004). For instance, men are identified as
responsible, strong, independent, self-confident, aggressive,
and successful, whereas women are described as passive,
emotional, nurturing, and warm. As Dabiri (2006) claims, it
8 SAGE Open
is students'gender that specifies the kind of positive or nega-
tive feedback. In her study, it was revealed that teachers'
definition of male roles emphasizes mastery and compe-
tence, whereas female role was defined as submissive and
dependent. This way of looking at female and male roles
may make the teacher accept the males' answers more easily
and not question the response that they provide, and it might
further explain why criticism and remediation were the only
categories whose distribution happened to be equal between
females and males by female teachers.
Accordingly, as it was discussed earlier, as most lan-
guage learners consider opportunities to talk and practice
using the language very important, this lack of opportunity
to use the language may hinder the development of females'
language ability. Therefore, the trend of male domination of
talking time in EFL classrooms gives reason for concern
that women are getting less than their fair share of opportu-
nities to practice using English.
Contrary to the quantitative findings of the study, teachers
in their interviews claimed that they treated female and male
students equally and acknowledged the fact that it was their
sincere belief that all students should have the right to access
equal opportunities for learning in the classroom, and it is the
teachers'responsibility to provide an equal learning environ-
ment in the classroom--a claim that was ironically counter-
balanced by the actual teacher­student interactions that were
shown to have been overwhelmingly male dominated. This
is in line with M. Sadker and Sadker (1994) that while teach-
ers may acknowledge gender-equity principles and may
express gender-fair viewpoints, what they actually do in their
own classes may not necessarily reflect this knowledge.
Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are not aware of
their own behavior with the genders and they may uncon-
sciously make males the focus of instruction, giving them
more frequent and more precise attention. Consequently,
when teachers interact less with female students they have
less chance to talk, which in turn might threaten develop-
ment of their language ability.
In further explaining the causes of the inequalities in
classrooms, it has been suggested that the greater number of
interactions directed toward male students is a result of
increased initiations of interactions by male students them-
selves. Some studies discovered that more males than
females volunteered to answer the questions (Altermatt,
Jovanovic, & Perry, 1998; Bailey, 1993; D'Ambrosio &
Hammer, 1996; Koca, 2009; D. Sadker et al., 1984;
M. Sadker & Sadker, 1986). Similarly, some of the teachers
interviewed in the current study also mentioned that the stu-
dents'voluntary participation was the likely cause of unequal
distribution of interactions.
However, observations in the present study demonstrated
that in all classrooms there were active students of both gen-
ders (males and females) who took a considerable number of
turns. This is a new situation, which in theory, calls for some
noticeable changes to the traditional way of distributional
imbalance.
The researchers also observed that, except for some active
females, majority of females were more likely to sit silently,
waiting to be called on. In other words, the number of silent
females, not being called on or not calling out in the class-
rooms, is remarkably higher than the number of silent males
proportional to their enrollment in the classrooms. This is
consistent with the findings of the study conducted by Salata
(1994) reporting that two thirds of the silent students in col-
lege classrooms are females, not having any interaction
whatsoever with their professors.
However, Morrow (1979) argues even if volunteering is
the cause, it is the teachers' responsibility to manage class-
room interactions and provide equal opportunities for all stu-
dents in the classroom. However, if student volunteering
remains a critical feature of teacher­student interactions,
simply instructing teachers to call on females more often will
not suffice. Efforts should be made to understand the reasons
behind females' relative nonparticipation, so that steps can
be taken to encourage females to become full participants in
the classroom question­answer interactions. Shomoossi,
Amouzadeh, and Ketabi (2008) note that some females feel
threatened in classrooms characterized by a high reliance on
participation through student volunteering. One way for
teachers to alleviate the perceived threat of volunteer partici-
pation is to use teaching strategies that defend females
against male dominance such as being aware of subtle gen-
der bias and in turn equally calling on females even if they
are not raising their hands.
Besides the possibility of males initiating more interac-
tions with teachers as the cause of this unequal distribution
of interaction, another factor that might have further height-
ened this verbal domination was gender segregation of many
of classes. In examining the seating pattern of the class-
rooms, the researchers of the current study observed that
females most commonly sit with other females, and males
cluster together. As male students talked and called out more,
teachers were drawn to the noisier male sections of the class,
a development that further silences females. This is also sup-
ported by many classroom observations that have shown
teachers talk more frequently to males no matter where they
are in the classroom, but only to females when they are
nearby (D. Sadker, Sadker, & Thomas, 1981). Other studies
have also shown that classroom seating patterns can influ-
ence interaction patterns, and that they could be a compelling
factor in determining interaction frequency and time (Yepez,
1994). Having informal interviews with the students to seek
the cause of this segregation, the researchers discovered that
although this segregation is sometimes put in effect by the
teacher, it is typically done by the students themselves.
Rarely does the teacher intervene to integrate seating and
group work, particularly in higher education. Of course
males and females have their own reasons for this segrega-
tion. When the students were asked why that was the case,
while some of the male students complained that it is their
female classmates who are reluctant to integrate with them,
the females voiced their own reason for the reluctance which
Hassaskhah and Roshanzamir 9
was the fear they had for mixing with males. They confessed
that as soon as they get together with a male classmate to
work, other friends would label them as girlfriend/boyfriend
that might have its own social consequences.
Whatever the reason is, M. Sadker and Sadker (1992)
suggest when left intact, these segregated grouping patterns
influence the distribution of teacher attention because the
instructor is drawn to sections of the room where one par-
ticular gender or group of students are clustered.
Consequently, one group of students is out of the instructor's
immediate visual zone, and literally invisible, they are less
likely to be called on to participate, and so they become
silent as well. These subtle inequities in attention might have
an impact on student achievement.
Conclusion and Recommendations for
Future Research
In general, although it was found that students' gender may
affect teacher­student interaction in adult classrooms, these
researchers believe that few teachers set out to discriminate
against their students based on race, ethnicity, gender, or eco-
nomic class. In other words, it is hard to believe that there is
a teacher, who wakes up in the morning with the intention of
excluding any student or class of students, but it happens
inadvertently, and the effect is withering. The reason perhaps
is hidden in the nature of this profession. Classrooms are
complex, busy places, and teachers engage in a variety of
interactions with their students each day. The speed of these
interactions makes it difficult for the teachers to be fully
aware of exactly what is happening (M. Sadker & Sadker,
1986). As a result of this, problems may arise and as the
empirical research suggests teachers may, in spite of their
best intentions, vary their behavior toward students on the
basis of student's gender. Yet, privilege is invisible to those
who have it (McIntosh, 1988).
Given that school is not only a place where students
acquire academic knowledge, but a place where they become
socialized and learn to assume particular roles in society,
teachers' role as models for students, and therefore, their
actions become important in communicating messages that
shape students' beliefs and their self-concepts. If teachers,
inadvertently or not, demonstrate gender-biased actions (e.g.,
giving more attention to males, permitting their interruptions
or attention-drawing behaviors, or asking them more intel-
lectually challenging questions in comparison with questions
asked of females), students may come to believe that males
are expected to be more outspoken and active, while females
are expected to be quiet and undisruptive and may also inter-
nalize the message and grow to believe that such differential
treatment for males and females is the norm.
This calls for developing a training program, like that pro-
posed by D. Sadker et al. (1984), to enable teachers and
administrators to detect this bias and create equitable teach-
ing methods. It is only by making it visible to ourselves that
we can eradicate its effects--no matter how unintentional--
on others. Program evaluations indicate that biased teaching
patterns can be changed, and teachers can achieve equity in
verbal interactions with their students. When teachers
become aware of differences in the way they interact with
female and male students and when they receive appropriate
resources and training, they can become more equitable in
their response patterns. Research shows that for elementary
and secondary school teachers, as well as college instructors,
this training leads not only to more equitable teaching but to
more effective teaching as well (D. Sadker et al., 1984). As a
result, individual educators, teachers and administrators, can
insure that instructional strategies and curricular innovations
benefit all our students. However, considering the diverging
empirical results, it would be naïve to attribute all such pat-
terns solely to student gender (Jones & Dindia, 2004). As
Jones and Dindia (2004) point out, several factors may shape
teacher-initiated behavior toward students, from among
which individual student factors (such as student gender, stu-
dent classroom behavior, student achievement, and student
race) and teacher factors (such as teacher gender and teach-
er's gender role orientation) have the most outstanding
influence.
Thus, future research is required to investigate additional
factors that are likely to affect teacher­student interactions in
classrooms, as they may offer explanations of gender differ-
ences in teacher­student interaction patterns. Some demo-
graphic factors that may be relevant include English language
proficiency, personality, and the racial or ethnic background
of teachers and students. It would also be interesting to see
how teaching strategies and personality differences among
teachers correlate with the tendency to interact more with
students of one gender. Researchers suggest that our soci-
ety's expectations and restraints on males and females have
led us to accept and condone certain behaviors when dis-
played by a member of the expected gender. Future research-
ers could look at students' perceptions, taking into
consideration that perceptions and expectations are shaped
by society and early learning experiences. Finally, the effect
of a training program concerning gender equity in language,
teacher interactions, and all other areas of learning on teach-
ers'interactions with students and their attitudes toward gen-
der roles can be investigated.
To reiterate, however complex, additional studies of these
types are needed because the payoff comes in a number of
ways. First, it more accurately portrays what actually occurs
in the classroom; of course what unfolds depends on the
teachers' next move. Second, it focuses on "equity of
access"--a unique feature of the classroom culture criteria
which allows teachers to reflect on their classroom events
with a less biased approach, the result of which can be fair
and equitable treatment of students as individuals and pro-
viding them with equal access to the full educational
resources of the learning environment, and finally if the
results are taken sincerely and put into practice correctly, it
10 SAGE Open
would potentially pave the way for establishing a learning
environment where every idea is a good one and no individ-
ual is left behind.
