Abstract
Background: Social support is frequently linked to positive parenting behavior. Similarly, studies increasingly show a link
between neighborhood residential environment and positive parenting behavior. However, less is known about how the
residential environment influences parental social support. To address this gap, we examine the relationship between
neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy and the level and change in parental caregiver perceptions
of non-familial social support.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The data for this study came from three data sources, the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) Study's Longitudinal Cohort Survey of caregivers and their offspring, a
Community Survey of adult residents in these same neighborhoods and the 1990 Census. Social support is measured at
Wave 1 and Wave 3 and neighborhood characteristics are measured at Wave 1. Multilevel linear regression models are fit.
The results show that neighborhood collective efficacy is a significant (ß = .04; SE = .02; p = .03), predictor of the positive
change in perceived social support over a 7 year period, however, not of the level of social support, adjusting for key
compositional variables and neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. In contrast concentrated neighborhood
disadvantage is not a significant predictor of either the level or change in social support.
Conclusion: Our finding suggests that neighborhood collective efficacy may be important for inducing the perception of
support from friends in parental caregivers over time.

Introduction
Social support, defined as ``...information leading the subject to
believe that he is cared for and loved, esteemed, and a member of
a network of mutual obligations'' has been consistently linked to
psychological and physical health across numerous studies [1­3].
Perceived social support among parents is also deemed to be an
important determinant of quality parenting, namely parental
responsiveness to a child's needs [4], lower risk of parent-to-child
physical aggression [5], and increased parental effectiveness [6]. In
contrast, inadequate parental support or social isolation has been
linked to diminished parental well-being, mental health problems,
and damaging parenting practices [7­11]. The residential context,
or neighborhood environment, has been identified as an important
determinant of both positive and negative parenting [12­15]. For
example, in a study of mothers and their 3-year old children,
Klebanov et al. (1994) found that neighborhood poverty was
negatively and associated with maternal warmth, even after
adjusting for salient family variables such as family poverty.
Despite the accumulation of evidence on the importance of
parental perceived social support and the residential environment
for parenting, only a few studies have examined the effect of the
residential environment itself on parental perceived social support.
Although small in number, these studies suggest that the
residential or neighborhood environment shapes parent's per-
ceived social support. For example, in a study of single African-
American mothers, Ceballo and McLoyd (2002) found that for
mothers, living in a disordered community environment charac-
terized by low maternal neighborhood ratings, high violent crime
rates and a high percentage of families living in poverty, the
potential positive effect of parental social support, on nurturing
parenting behaviors was significantly attenuated [16]. In another
ecological study of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and
child maltreatment rates, Garbarino and Sherman (1980) found
higher child maltreatment rates in neighborhoods with fewer
economic resources [9]. They concluded this finding was

explained by diminished access to social resources in the
neighborhood.
While these studies suggest that parental perceived social
support may be contextually patterned, or influenced by
features of the neighborhood environment, there is insufficient
empirical evidence to demonstrate a conclusive relationship. In
particular, it is unclear whether social ties (i.e. social
relationships) are more salient than the ``activation'' of these
social ties to engage in collective action, a concept termed
neighborhood collective efficacy. Collective efficacy is com-
prised of two related constructs: mutual trust (referred to as
social cohesion) and the willingness of neighborhoods to
intervene for the public good (referred to as informal social
control) [17]. Collective efficacy has been examined in relation
to outcomes such as partner violence [18], self-rated health [19]
and adolescent suicide [20].
Studies have examined the two sub-components of collective
efficacy ­ neighborhood level informal social control and social
cohesion ­ independently in relation to family functioning. For
example, Kohen et al (2008) found associations between residing
in neighborhoods with low social cohesion and maternal
depression and family dysfunction. Similarly, in another study,
researchers reported that an increase in neighborhood informal
social control was associated with a decrease in neglectful and
psychologically harsh parenting [15] However, we found only one
study that examined neighborhood collective efficacy in relation to
parenting [21]. Simon et al (2005) found increases in the
authoritative parenting of African American caregivers, in
neighborhoods with increasing collective efficacy. However we
found no studies which examine collective efficacy in relation to
parental perceived social support though we hypothesize that these
phenomena are related.
While few studies examine neighborhood characteristics in the
context of parental perceived social support, numerous studies
link neighborhood economic deprivation to a wide range of
negative health and mental health related outcomes [22­26]. It is
believed that neighborhood social ties and interactions as well as
norms and collective efficacy represent two important pathways
through which economic deprivation impact individual out-
comes. For example, parents who reside in economically deprived
neighborhoods may have limited access to social resources and
feel more socially isolated, making them less likely to engage in
collective social action [27,28]. In contrast, parents living in
resource rich environments characterized by mutual trust and the
potential for collective action, may be more likely to share
parenting strategies, resources and feedback and ultimately feel
more supported.
Given the current gaps in the literature and the theoretical
relationships described above, we use data from a longitudinal
study of parents to explore three research questions: First, to
examine whether there is an association between neighborhood
concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy and the level
of perceived social support parents report from friends at one
point in time (cross-sectional analysis), second to examine
whether neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collec-
tive efficacy induce changes in perceived social support over time
(longitudinal analysis) and third to examine whether there is an
interaction between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage
and collective efficacy in both the cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal analysis. We focus on both cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal analyses, given that social support can fluctuate over the
lifespan [29,30].

Study Design
Data for these analyses came from the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a landmark
study conducted from 1994 to 2001 investigating the individual,
family, and neighborhood-level causes and consequences of youth
exposure to urban violence [31]. The PHDCN consisted of two
main components: (1) a community survey (CS), collected from 1994­
1995 of residents living in urban neighborhoods which was aimed
at understanding the social, economic, organizational, political,
and cultural structures and processes of those neighborhoods [32]
and (2) a longitudinal cohort survey (LCS) of children, adolescents, and
young adults ages 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 living in those
neighborhoods collected from 1994­1997 (Wave 1), 1997­1999
(Wave 2), and 2000­2001 (Wave 3). To obtain more information
about the structural (i.e. socio-demographic) characteristics of each
neighborhood, PHDCN investigators also linked these two data
sources to the 1990 US Census [33]. For this study, we utilized the
1990 Census measure given its proximity to the Wave 1 data
collection, started in 1994. In order to be consistent, we also
utilized the 1990 census data in the longitudinal analysis.As
described below, we used data from the LCS to construct the
parent-level variables; data from the CS and Census were used to
derive the neighborhood-level variables.
Community Survey (CS). To obtain a sample of participants
for both the CS and LCS, PHDCN investigators began by
dividing the city of Chicago into 847 populated census tracts,
which were then collapsed to form 343 ecologically meaningful,
geographically compact, homogenous neighborhood clusters
(NCs). The neighborhood clusters were approximately 8000
people large and were homogenous on key census indicators.
This was in contrast to the 77 communities in Chicago, which
consisted of approximately 40,000 people each and were less likely
to represent ``true'' neighborhoods. For the CS, investigators used
a three-stage cluster sampling design. At the first stage, city blocks
were randomly sampled within each of the 343 NCs. At the second
stage, dwelling units were randomly sampled within each city
block. In most cases, all dwelling units in a NC were selected,
though in large NCs, census blocks were sampled using probability
proportional to size sampling methods. At the third stage, one
adult resident (aged 18 and over) within each dwelling unit was
randomly selected and interviewed for the CS. CS respondents
ranged in age from 18 to 83, were predominately female (65%),
and representative of the neighborhoods from which the LCS
sample was drawn. While residents were interviewed from all areas
of Chicago, a greater percentage of respondents were included in
the CS that represented the NCs of the LCS.
Longitudinal Cohort Survey (LCS). To obtain a sample of
participants for the LCS, investigators stratified the 343 NCs into 7
levels of race/ethnicity and 3 levels of socioeconomic status (SES),
resulting in 21 strata and 80 NCs (note: three strata did not
contain any NCs). A list of all dwelling units in the 80 NCs was
enumerated, and probability proportional to size sampling
methods were used to select blocks, dwelling units, and persons
within dwelling units. Households with children (and pregnancies)
within 6 months of the target cohort age (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18)
were selected to participate in the LCS. All household members
were invited to participate in the study, which followed parents (i.e.

individuals who spent the most time caring for the child and
resided with the child at least 5 nights per week) and children ages
0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 over a period of 7 years (from 1994 to
2001) across three waves of data collection.
For all LCS cohorts except 0 and 18, both parents and children
were interviewed. Separate research assistants administered the
parent and child interviews. Interviews took place primarily in-
person, though participants who declined to complete in-person
interviews were interviewed via phone. Interviews were conducted
in Spanish, English, and Polish and interpreters were provided for
participants who spoke other languages. Participants were
compensated between $5­$20 per interview depending on their
age and the wave of data collection. Child participants were
interviewed on a range of topics including language development,
substance use, values, and sensation-seeking traits, while parents
were interviewed on topics including family structure, parent-child
relationships, and family mental health.
Of 8,304 eligible participants, 6226 were interviewed at Wave 1
(75% completion) [34]. Wave 1 data collection occurred between
1994 and 1997. Wave 2 data were collected from 1997 to 1999
(85.9% completion) and Wave 3 data collection occurred from
2000­2001 (78.19% completion). Data from the Wave 1 and
Wave 3 LCS were used in this study. The PHDCN data presents a
unique opportunity to examine a longitudinal cohort of children
and families and assess neighborhoods from an independent
sample of neighborhood residents from urban Chicago.
Full and Analytic Samples
At Wave 1, 6226 parents of children in cohorts 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15
and 18 completed an interview for the LCS. Therefore the original
dataset consisted of 6226 rows of data on children ages 0, 3, 6, 9,
12, 15 and 18 years old (i.e. 1 child per row). Parental caregivers of
18 year olds were not eligible for inclusion in this study mainly
because they were not asked the outcome of interest. Multiple
children could be nested within a caregiver but since the dataset
was at the child level and we were interested in caregiver level
data, we selected one row per parental caregiver (i.e. one child
row) to use in our analysis. All the variables used in the analysis
were caregiver level variables, which were identical across all
children in the same family (e.g. all children with the same
parental caregiver, had the same educational level recorded for
that caregiver). We also noted that some caregivers changed from
Wave 1 to Wave 3 and therefore we excluded them from our
analysis. Technically nobody was excluded from the analytic
sample size through these steps therefore we did not implement a
sensitivity analysis. At this stage our analytic sample size was 2782.
We did exclude approximately 3% of parents from the model
analysis as these parents did not have complete data on the
outcome of interest at Wave 1 and Wave 3. As this number was
less than 5% of the overall sample we did not implement a
sensitivity analysis.
Finally, we only included parents with complete parental
perceived social support data (i.e. parents with no missing
responses on the 7 items). We choose to include participants with
complete data, rather than impute in order to be conservative in
our estimates.
Measures
The variables in this study came from measures included in the
CS, LCS, or Census and tapped information about parents and
the neighborhood environment. These measures are described
below.
Perceived Social Support. Perceived social support from
friends and family members was assessed among parents using a
20 item Provision of Social Relations (PSRP) instrument (Table 1),
which queries parents about the social support they receive from
family members and friends [35]. For this study, we examined
perceived support from friends only, given our hypothesis that this
type of social support would be strongly related to the
neighborhood environment. Support from friends was measured
on a Likert-type scale (response options were 1 = very true;
2 = somewhat true; 3 = not true) with eight items measured at both
Wave 1 and Wave 3. The PSRP was not implemented at Wave 2,
therefore we were restricted to analyzing this measure at two
waves. The items comprising this scale demonstrate good internal
consistency reliability in this sample (a = 0.75).
We used these data to create several different representations of
perceived social support among parents. First, we derived a mean
social support score for each parental caregiver, based on the
average response to the eight social support items at each wave.
Second, we constructed two representations of this mean score for
each set of analyses. For the cross-sectional analysis, we utilized the
mean score for each caregiver at Wave 1. For the longitudinal
analysis, we calculated a difference score (Wave 3 mean minus
Wave 1 mean) for each parent caregiver. We constructed a
difference score rather than controlling for baseline social support,
based on evidence that controlling for the baseline score of a
predictor in a longitudinal model can result in spuriously inflated
coefficients [36].
Neighborhood Features. Measures of the neighborhood
environment tapped both structural or socio-demographic
measures of communities and social characteristics or attributes
of social relationships of each neighborhood and came from either
the 1990 Census or the 1995 CS data. We used these sources to
construct two measures of neighborhood environment. The first
was neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, which was derived
by PHDCN investigators using a factor analysis from variables
collected in the 1990 Census [27]. This factor included items that
corresponded to percent below the poverty line, percent on public
assistance, percent unemployed, percent female-headed
households, percent under age 18, and percent African American.
The second measure, neighborhood collective efficacy, was
constructed from LCS caregiver reports. In the LCS, respondents
were asked to indicate their level of agreement with twelve
statements; six items measured neighborhood informal social control
or willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good or (i.e. if
children were spray-painting graffiti on a local building) and six
items measured social cohesion, or connectedness between neighbors
(i.e. this is a close knit community). To generate neighborhood-
level values for these variables, we calculated a mean neighbor-
hood score across the 12 items. We grand-mean centered all
neighborhood measures to facilitate interpretability. This proce-
dure allows us to interpret the outcome for a neighborhood with
the average level of each neighborhood measure.
Covariates. Throughout our analyses, we controlled for
covariates obtained via parental self-report at Wave 1 of the
LCS. These included: age (continuous), race/ethnicity
(0 = White,1 = Black, 2 = Hispanic, 3 = Other), education (0 = less
than high school, 1 = high school, 2 = greater than high school),
sex (0 = female, 1 = male), household salary (0 = more than
$50,000, 1 = between $40,000­$49,999, 2 = $30,000­$39,999,
3 = $20,000­$29,999, 4 = $10,000­$19,999, 5 = $0­$9,999), and
marital status (0 = married, 1 = single, 2 = partnered). Given that
we imputed household salary information for approximately 4% of
cases, we included an imputation indicator.

Analytic Approach
We began by conducting univariate and bivariate analyses to
examine sample demographic characteristics, the distribution of
and interrelationships between the predictors and outcomes, and
evaluate the extent of missing data present. We then utilized multi-
level linear regression for the cross-sectional analysis (i.e. examine
the association between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage
and collective efficacy on mean levels of social support at Wave 1)
and longitudinal analysis (i.e. examine the association between
neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy
on the change in social support from Wave 1 to Wave 3). For both
the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we constructed all
regression models in a sequential fashion. Specifically, we began
by fitting a null or intercept-only model. We then introduced the
covariates into the model, individually. First we examined
neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy,
individually in models with the demographic variables. Second, we
examined the two neighborhood variables in the model simulta-
neously. And finally, we introduced an interaction term of the two
neighborhood variables. We reported parameter estimates and
standard errors, and variance estimates for each model. We
performed all analyses in SAS 9.1. All models were estimated using
SAS PROC MIXED.
Results
Sample Demographics
Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of this sample at
Wave 1. The sample was predominantly female (95%), Hispanic
(42%) and included 47% of parents had less than a high school
education. Approximately 43% of the sample reported earning less
than 20,000 dollars a year. The majority of the sample was
married (56%) and the mean age was 33 years.
Means and Correlations
Mean comparison analyses were conducted to determine
associations between the demographic variables and both the level
and change in caregiver perceived social support (See Table 2). No
significant gender differences in the level of social support were
observed. However, white caregivers as compared with all caregivers
in other racial/ethnic groups (p,.0001), caregivers with more than a
high school education as compared with less educated caregivers
(p,.0001), caregivers with a household salary greater than 50 K
(p,.0001) and married caregivers, as compared with caregivers with
all other marital status types (p,.0001) had a significantly higher
level of social support at Wave 1. In contrast, there were no
significant associations between any of the demographic variables
and change in social support, with the exception of gender (p = .0106).
Cross-Sectional Analyses Focusing on Mean Levels of
Social Support
In Table 3 we present the results from multi-level linear
regression models examining the adjusted associations between the
neighborhood variables and parental caregiver mean levels of
social support. The null model (not shown in table) describes the
mean level of social support in this sample of parental caregivers
(ß = 1.57; SE = .01; p = ,.001). In a model that adjusted for
covariates, neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collec-
tive efficacy were not significantly associated with caregiver level of
social support. As noted in Table 4, while 1.2% of the variation in
parental caregiver perceived social support at Wave 1 was
attributable to neighborhood variations in social support, this
effect was rendered null when compositional (i.e. caregiver)
characteristics were introduced into the model.
Longitudinal Analyses Focusing on Change in Social
Support
Table 5 presents the results from the multi-level linear
regression models examining the adjusted associations between
the neighborhood variables and change in the caregiver level of
social support. The null model (not shown in table) describes the
mean change in social support in this sample of parental caregivers
(ß = .07; SE = .07; p = ,.001). After controlling for caregiver
covariates neighborhood collective efficacy was positively and
significantly associated with the changes in a caregiver's perceived
social support (ß = .04; SE = .02; p = .03), such that each one unit
change in neighborhood collective efficacy was associated with .04
increase in caregiver perceived social support from Wave 1 to
Wave 3. However, neighborhood concentrated disadvantage was
not significantly associated with the change in caregiver perceived
social support. The interaction between neighborhood collective
efficacy and concentrated disadvantage was also not significant.
Finally, as noted in Table 6, while .1% of the variation in the
change in parental caregiver perceived social support was
attributable to neighborhood variations in social support, this
effect was rendered null when compositional (i.e. caregiver)
characteristics were introduced into the model.
Discussion
Parental social support has been linked to positive parenting
practices in the empirical literature [4,6]. Additionally, studies

have also linked neighborhood environment to parenting practices
[14,37]. However, little is known about whether and how the
neighborhood environment impinges on or promotes parental
social support. This study was conducted to address this
knowledge-gap by exploring the influence of neighborhood
structural and social processes on the level and change in parental
caregiver perceived non-familial social support.
Our study found support for a relationship between neighbor-
hood collective efficacy and change in parental perceived social
support however we did not find support for the relationship
between neighborhood collective efficacy and level of perceived
social support. Discrepant findings between longitudinal and cross-
sectional models are not uncommon in the literature [38]. Our
findings seemed to suggest that neighborhood collective efficacy
presented no immediate effect on a parental caregiver's level of
perceived social support, but that the effects of collective efficacy
could accumulate over time and have a lagged effect on the
change in a caregiver's level of perceived social support. In order
to explore this further, we tested the interaction between length of
residence in a neighborhood and collective efficacy. The
interaction term was not significant, suggesting that the beneficial
effect of neighborhood collective efficacy on parental perceived
social support is not stronger for longer term residents.
The observed one unit change in individual perceived social
support for a .04 increase in collective efficacy is important when
we consider that these effects are applied across the population to
many caregivers. While this effect is small, it is ``spread'' across the
population and community-wide interventions to promote neigh-
borhood collective efficacy (in addition to individual level
interventions to promote social support) may be a more efficient
way to promote parental perceived social support across
communities.
Other studies have found similar positive effects of living in
neighborhoods with high collective efficacy for other outcomes

Neighborhood Influences on Parental Social Support
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34235
[19,27]. It is possible that parents living in neighborhoods
characterized by high collective efficacy and collective support
may be more likely to feel individually supported. This important
finding persisted, even in models adjusting for neighborhood
concentrated disadvantage. This suggests that living in a
neighborhood characterized by collective action can induce the
feeling of being supported in parental caregivers, irrespective of
the socio-demographic resources available in a neighborhood.
This study is innovative from multiple perspectives. First, it fills
an important gap in the literature by examining how support-
inducing neighborhood processes, such as collective efficacy, may
influence an important potential determinant of parenting--
namely parental perceived social support. Second, this study is
innovative in its use of a longitudinal approach to this question,
given evidence that social support can fluctuate over the lifespan
[29,30]. Finally, unlike other studies of parenting and neighbor-
hood context [13], our neighborhood variables were not derived
from the participants themselves, but from an independent sample
of residents from urban Chicago.
Despite these strengths, we acknowledge several limitations to
this research. First, social support was measured via a self-report
instrument which may not reflect the actual receipt of social
support [39]. Despite this limitation, there is evidence that unless
social support is perceived, it cannot be used [30]. Second,
neighborhood characteristics utilized in this study were only
measured at time point. It is possible that neighborhood
characteristics changed over time. Third, it is possible that
individual caregivers with high or low social support elected to
move into particular neighborhoods. This may have influenced
our findings away from the null. In order to address this limitation
we implemented a rigorous adjustment for key caregiver level
variables that could potentially explain selection into a particular
neighborhood. In future studies, we will explore the use of analytic
strategies such as instrumental variable analysis to address the issue
of selection. Fourth, we recognize that administratively defined
neighborhoods do not necessarily equate with ``socially meaning-
ful'' neighborhoods. However every effort was made to ensure that
the neighborhood clusters selected for this study approximated
local neighborhoods and were internally homogenous on key
census indicators. Fifth, parental perceived social support was only
collected at two time points, Wave 1 and Wave 3, therefore we
were restricted to a two wave longitudinal analysis. We recognize
that this is a limitation of our study. It is possible that social
support is erroneously measured as low at Wave 1 and high at
Wave 2, suggesting there is improvement in parental perceived
social support from Wave 1 to Wave 2. when in fact this is
attributable to measurement error [40]. Despite this limitation, we
believe the presentation of both cross sectional and longitudinal,
albeit a two wave longitudinal model is a strength of this study.
Sixth, while there are methods for constructing ecometric
neighborhood measures of collective efficacy (e.g. systematic social
observation) we utilized a measure constructed from the
aggregated responses of individuals. While an ecometric measure
would possibly capture the concept of collective efficacy as a
collective characteristic, as suggested by Subramanian et al. (2002),
these types of measures may fail to capture the ``perceived social
dynamism'' that is an important component of a community's
social capital. Furthermore these approaches are not yet well
tested and are both time and cost intensive. Seventh and final, our
study has limited generalizability to individuals living in neigh-
borhood such as urban Chicago, and particularly to female
caregivers as our sample was predominately female. Despite this
limitation, the PHDCN was uniquely set up to allow us to move
beyond traditional census and parental reported measures to
capture neighborhood characteristics. It is also important to note
that Chicago was chosen by PHDCN researchers because of the
racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity seen across each
neighborhood.
In future studies we intend to expand on this research and
incorporate different measures of social support, by interviewing
both the recipients and the providers of social support. We also
hope to examine other types of social support, beyond emotional
social support. For instance, instrumental social support may be
particularly sensitive to neighborhood characteristics. Finally, we
also intend to examine fluctuations in neighborhood attributes
over time and relate these to changes in individual outcomes.
Implications
Our finding that neighborhood environment matters for a
parent's perception of feeling supported can inform the develop-
ment of neighborhood level interventions for bolstering parental
social support. An intervention designed to promote individual
parental caregiver perceived social support would benefit from the
inclusion of a community-wide effort to promote neighborhood
collective efficacy. Collective efficacy stems from the shared belief
by neighborhood individuals that they are capable of making a
difference in their community and consequently are actively
engaged in this process. This would not preclude providing
interventions to enhance individual social support, however, a
community-wide intervention would likely be a more efficient way
to intervene and the potential benefit would be distributed across
the population. Ultimately, an intervention that could promote
parental social support would have great potential to improve
parenting practices. [4,41] and result in positive child outcomes.
