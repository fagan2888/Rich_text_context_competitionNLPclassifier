HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 2
(HSV-2) is the cause of
most genital herpes and is
one of the most prevalent
sexually transmitted infections
worldwide.1-3 Herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) is typically transmitted
during childhood via nonsexual
contact.4 Most HSV-1 and HSV-2
infections are subclinical. When infec-
tion is symptomatic, the clinical mani-
festations of HSV-2 are typically
characterized by recurrent, painful
vesicular and ulcerative lesions in
the genital and anal areas.3-5 In con-
trast, symptomatic HSV-1 infections
are usually manifested as recurrent
orolabial and facial lesions.3 However,
HSV-1 has emerged as a principle
causative agent of genital herpes in
some developed countries.6-9 In the
United States, HSV-1 is an important
cause of genital herpes and its impor-
tance is increasing in college students
and other selected populations.10-13
Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can also cause
infrequent but serious diseases such as
blindness, encephalitis, and neonatal
infections.4
Strong synergy has been found be-
tween HSV-2 and human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV).14-17 Infection with
HSV-2 can at least double the risk for
sexually acquired HIV infection be-
cause recurrent genital herpes can pro-
vide a port of entry for HIV and re-
cruit HIV target cells to the sites of
epithelial infection.18,19 Infection with
HSV-2 may accelerate HIV progres-
sion and increase the infectiousness of
HIV, thus enhancing sexual transmis-
sion of HIV.20-22 Monitoring HSV-2 se-
roprevalence may help direct HIV pre-
vention efforts to populations at greater
risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV
infection.

Context Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 are common infections world-
wide. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the cause of most genital herpes and is
almost always sexually transmitted. In contrast, HSV-1 is usually transmitted during
childhood via nonsexual contacts. Preexisting HSV-1 antibodies can alleviate clinical
manifestations of subsequently acquired HSV-2. Furthermore, HSV-1 has become an
important cause of genital herpes in some developed countries.
Objective To examine trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States
in 1999-2004 compared with 1988-1994.
Design, Settings, and Participants Cross-sectional, nationally representative sur-
veys (US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]), were used
to compare national seroprevalence estimates from 1999-2004 with those from 1988-
1994, and changes in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence since 1976-1980 were re-
viewed. Persons aged 14 to 49 years were included in these analyses.
Main Outcome Measures Seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies based
on results from type-specific immunodot assays; diagnosis of genital herpes.
Results The overall age-adjusted HSV-2 seroprevalence was 17.0% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 15.8%-18.3%) in 1999-2004 and 21.0% (95% CI, 19.1%-
23.1%) in 1988-1994, a relative decrease of 19.0% between the 2 surveys (95% CI,
-28.6% to -9.5%; P.001). Decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were especially con-
centrated in persons aged 14 to 19 years between 1988 and 2004. In adolescents aged
17 to 19 years and young adults, the decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were signifi-
cant even after adjusting for changes in sexual behaviors. Among those infected with
HSV-2, the percentage who reported having been diagnosed with genital herpes was
statistically different (14.3% in 1999-2004 and 9.9% in 1988-1994; P=.02). Seroprev-
alence of HSV-1 decreased from 62.0% (95% CI, 59.6%-64.6%) in 1988-1994 to 57.7%
(95% CI, 55.9%-59.5%) in 1999-2004, a relative decrease of 6.9% between the 2 sur-
veys (95% CI, -11.6% to -2.3%; P=.006). Among persons infected with HSV-1 but
not with HSV-2, a higher percentage reported having been diagnosed with genital her-
pes in 1999-2004 compared with 1988-1994 (1.8% vs 0.4%, respectively; P.001).
Conclusions These data show declines in HSV-2 seroprevalence, suggesting that
the trajectory of increasing HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States has been re-
versed. Seroprevalence of HSV-1 decreased but the incidence of genital herpes caused
by HSV-1 may be increasing.

Changes in HSV-1 seroprevalence
can alter the clinical manifestations of
subsequently acquired HSV-2 infec-
tion. Compared with persons seroposi-
tive for HSV-1, those persons lacking
HSV-1 antibodies are almost 3 times
more likely to have a symptomatic
HSV-2 infection.13,23 Seroprevalence of
HSV-1 may also influence decisions
about HSV-2 vaccination strategies be-
cause the vaccine that is being clini-
cally tested may be efficacious only in
those seronegative for HSV-1.24
Serosurveys have been one of
the best approaches to study the
epidemiology of HSV infections. In the
United States, data from National
Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES) during 1976-
1980 (NHANES II) and 1988-1994
(NHANES III) indicated that the
overall seroprevalence of HSV-2
increased by 30%,25 while the overall
HSV-1seroprevalencewasunchanged.26
We examined national trends in HSV-1
and HSV-2 seroprevalence in the 1999-
2004 survey compared with the 1988-
1994 survey.
METHODS
Study Population
and Survey Design
The NHANES are a series of cross-
sectional national surveys conducted by
the National Center for Health Statis-
tics. Details of the survey methods have
beenpublishedpreviously.27 Briefly,dur-
ing each survey, a random sample of the
US civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation was selected using a complex,
stratified, multistage probability sample
design. Some populations, such as ado-
lescents,non-Hispanicblacks,andMexi-
can Americans were oversampled. Per-
sons selected for the surveys were
interviewed and underwent a health ex-
amination. In 1999, the NHANES was
redesigned to become a continuous sur-
vey using otherwise similar methods. A
nationally representative sample of the
US civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation is selected each year and usually
data from 2 or more years are com-
bined to achieve adequate sample sizes
for analyses. Seroprevalence of HSV has
been part of NHANES since 1988-
1994 but national HSV seroprevalence
was first estimated using leftover sera
samples from 1976-1980.
For 1999-2004, sex was defined as
vaginal, oral, or anal. In contrast, the
term sexual intercourse was used in
1988-1994. In addition, question-
naires were administered using audio
computer-assisted self-interview in
1999-2004 instead of face-to-face in-
terview in 1988-1994. A question about
history of diagnosed genital herpes was
asked for persons aged 18 years or older
("Has a doctor or other health care pro-
fessional ever told you that you had
genital herpes?").
Our analyses focused on the trends
in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence be-
tween 1988-1994 and 1999-2004.
About 10.5 years separates the mid-
point between the 2 surveys. The com-
mon age groups for the surveys are per-
sons aged 14 to 49 years. Of the persons
aged 14 to 49 years who were selected
for the NHANES in 1988-1994, 84%
were interviewed, 78% were exam-
ined, and 61% were tested for HSV-1
and HSV-2. For 1999-2004, the corre-
sponding numbers were 82%, 78%, and
72%, respectively.
The NHANES survey for 1999-2004
was approved by the institutional re-
view board of the US Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention. Informed
consent was obtained from survey par-
ticipants or their legal guardians.
Laboratory Methods
PurifiedglycoproteinsspecificforHSV-1
(gG-1)orHSV-2(gG-2)wereusedasan-
tigens to detect type-specific antibod-
ies using solid-phase enzymatic immu-
nodotassays.28,29 Theperformanceofthe
immunodot assays is high with respect
to sensitivity and ability to discrimi-
nate between HSV-1 and HSV-2.28-30 In
1999-2004, the same immunodot as-
says and the same laboratory were used
as for previous NHANES.25,26
Statistical Analyses
SUDAAN software version 9.0 (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Cary, NC)
was used for statistical analyses to
account for the complex survey de-
sign. We estimated HSV-1 and HSV-2
seroprevalence by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity according to NHANES de-
sign domains. Confidence intervals
(CIs) for the seroprevalence estimates
were calculated based on a log trans-
formation with the SE calculated us-
ing the  method.31 Differences in se-
roprevalence between the surveys were
considered to be statistically signifi-
cant if the 2-sampled t test had a P value
of less than .05.32
Race/ethnicity categories were nearly
identical between 1988-1994 and 1999-
200433 and were defined by self-report
as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic
white, and Mexican American. Per-
sons who did not fit into these catego-
ries were classified as other and were in-
cluded in the total population. The race
categories used for 1976-1980 were
white, black, and other. To permit com-
parisons between the 3 surveys, par-
ticipants who reported Hispanic ances-
try in the 1976-1980 survey were
excluded from the white and black race
categories.
All seroprevalence estimates were
weighted to represent the US civilian,
noninstitutionalized population and to
account for oversampling and nonre-
sponse to the interview and the medi-
cal examination.34 Among participants
aged 14 to 49 years who were inter-
viewed and examined during 1999-
2004, 8.6% did not have HSV serologi-
cal results. The reasons for missing
results may include refusal or unsuc-
cessful venipuncture or the need to
use serum for other tests. We investi-
gated the impact of the missing sero-
logical results on HSV-1 and HSV-2
seroprevalence estimates by identify-
ing significant demographic predictors
of missing results through a weighted
logistic regression model and used the
model to further adjust the weights.
The estimates using further adjusted
weights changed slightly (changes in
point estimates ranging from -1.3% to
0.6% for HSV-1 and -0.1 to 0.9% for
HSV-2) but were within 95% CIs of
seroprevalence estimates based on
weights published by the National

Center for Health Statistics. Similar
results were found from investigations
into the missing HSV serological
results in 1988-1994. These results
convinced us to use weights from the
National Center for Health Statistics in
our analyses.
Logistic regression methods de-
scribed by Korn and Barry35 were used
to examine whether differences in so-
ciodemographic or sexual behavior be-
tween the survey participants might ex-
plain the observed changes in HSV-2
seroprevalence between 1988-1994 and
1999-2004. The survey indicator vari-
able was forced into the model, and
other variables were added in order of
statistical significance. The criteria for
inclusion and remaining in the model
was based on the Satterthwaite-
adjusted F-test P value of .10 or less.
Once all variables that met the criteria
had been included in the model, pair-
wise interactions were evaluated. Sev-
eral significant interactions with sex led
us to develop models separately for
males and females. Variables that met
the entry criteria in either model were
included in the final models for both
sexes. To facilitate interpretations, ad-
justed seroprevalence was calculated
from the sex-specific logistic regres-
sion model using the PREDMARG
statement in SUDAAN. The adjusted se-
roprevalence, also known as predic-
tive margin, was generated using the lo-
gistic regression model to estimate the
probability of being HSV-2 positive for
every individual, averaging over the dis-
tribution of the covariates among the
entire weighted sample.
RESULTS
Seroprevalence of HSV-2
in 1999-2004
In 1999-2004, the seroprevalence of
HSV-2 among participants aged 14 to
49 years was 17.2% (95% CI, 15.9%-
18.7%; TABLE 1). The seroprevalence
was higher among females than among
males (23.1% vs 11.2%; P.001). Se-
roprevalence of HSV-2 was 13.7%
among non-Hispanic whites, 40.3%
among non-Hispanic blacks, and 11.9%
among Mexican Americans.
The overall HSV-2 seroprevalence in-
creased rapidly with increasing age from
1.6% in participants aged 14 to 19 years
to 26.3% in participants aged 40 to 49
years.
As reported in previous NHANES,25
HSV-2 seroprevalence also varied sig-
nificantly by a number of demo-
graphicandbehavioralfactors(Table1).
Seroprevalence of HSV-2 was higher
among persons who were divorced,
separated, or widowed; those living
below the poverty level; who had ever
used cocaine; and who had sex for the

first time at the age of 17 years or
younger. Seroprevalence of HSV-2 was
3.8% in those who reported 1 lifetime
sex partner. This prevalence increased
to 39.9% in those who reported 50 or
more lifetime partners. Seropreva-
lence of HSV-2 was higher in those who
had a larger number of lifetime sexual
partners (FIGURE 1). In non-Hispanic
black women, however, the seroprev-
alenceofHSV-2wassignificantlyhigher
comparedwithotherswhoreportedthe
same number of lifetime partners.
Trends in HSV-2 Seroprevalence
Between 1988-1994
and 1999-2004
The analyses included 9165 persons
from the 1988-1994 survey and 11 508
persons from the 1999-2004 survey
who were aged 14 to 49 years and had
serum samples tested for HSV-2
(TABLE 2). Using the 2000 US Census
civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion aged 14 to 49 years as the stan-
dard, the overall age-adjusted HSV-2 se-
roprevalence was 21.0% (95% CI,
19.1%-23.1%) in 1988-1994 and 17.0%
(95% CI, 15.8%-18.3%) in 1999-
2004, a relative decrease of 19.0% (95%
CI, -28.6% to -9.5%) between the 2
surveys (P.001). Seroprevalence of
HSV-2 decreased significantly in males,
non-Hispanic whites, and Mexican
Americans. The overall decreases in fe-
males and non-Hispanic blacks were
not statistically significant.
The decrease in HSV-2 seropreva-
lence was concentrated in the younger
age groups. The decreases were signifi-
cant in all age groups except in partici-
pants aged 40 to 49 years (Table 2). Sta-
tistically significant decreases occurred
in adolescents aged 14 to 19 years in
both males and females and in all race/
ethnicity groups. Based on the civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population
counts from the 2000 US Census, there
were 24 million adolescents aged 14 to
19 years in the United States; the de-
crease in HSV-2 seroprevalence from
5.8% to 1.6% corresponds to 1 million
fewer infections in this age group alone.
Selected sexual behaviors between
1988-1994 and 1999-2004 were com-
pared. Due to different ages at which
sexual behavior questions were asked
in the 2 surveys, the percentage who
ever had sex were compared only in
those aged 15 years or older and the
number of lifetime sex partners were
compared only in those aged 17 years
or older. The percentage of partici-
pants aged 15 to 19 years who reported
having had sex decreased from 59.6%
in 1988-1994 to 54.8% in 1999-2004,
a relative decrease of 8% (P=.05);
among participants aged 20 to 29 years,
the decrease was 4% from 95.5% to
91.6%(P=.002).Amongthosewhohad
sex, the mean number of lifetime sex
partners did not differ in participants
aged 17 to 19 years but increased in
thoseaged20to49years(P.001).Fur-
ther analyses showed that this increase
occurred only in females and was sta-
tistically significant in all 3 age groups
from 20 through 49 years. The geomet-
ric mean number of sex partners in
females aged 20 to 49 years increased
from 3.3 (95% CI, 3.1-3.6) in 1988-
1994to4.5(95%CI,4.2-4.7)(P.001).
The adjusted HSV-2 seroprevalence
in males and females after controlling
for differences in sociodemographics
and/or sexual behaviors between the 2
surveys are presented in TABLE 3. The
decrease in HSV-2 seroprevalence be-
came significant in females but the over-
all decreases were still greater in males
(31.9%) than in females (19.4%)
(Table 3). Adjusted HSV-2 seropreva-
lence significantly decreased in males
younger than 40 years and in all fe-
male age groups with the exception of
those aged 30 to 39 years. In males, the
adjusted decreases were significant in
non-Hispanic whites and Mexican
Americans. In females, the adjusted de-
creases were significant among all 3 ra-
cial/ethnic groups.
Trends in HSV-1 Seroprevalence
Between 1988-1994
and 1999-2004
In 1999-2004, HSV-1 seroprevalence
varied by age and race/ethnicity, simi-
lar to the previous report.26 The over-
all age-adjusted seroprevalence of
HSV-1 was 62.0% (95% CI, 59.6%-
64.6%) in 1988-1994 and 57.7% (95%
CI, 55.9%-59.5%) in 1999-2004, a rela-
tive decrease of 6.9% (95% CI, -11.6%
to -2.3%; P=.006; TABLE 4). When
HSV-1 seroprevalence was compared by
key demographic variables, changes
ranging from -21.6% to 2.6% were ob-
served (Table 4). Although the de-
creases were statistically significant in
many groups, there was no concentra-
tion in any subpopulation defined by
age, sex, or race/ethnicity.
Further analyses limited only to per-
sons born in any of the 50 states in the
United States or in Washington, DC,

were performed because birthplace can
be an important determinant for HSV-1
acquisition during childhood. The cor-
responding age-adjusted seropreva-
lence was generally lower in persons
born in the United States but the trend
was similar to that in the total popula-
tion. In US-born persons, HSV-1 sero-
prevalence decreased by 10% from
59.4% (95% CI, 56.8%-62.0%) in 1988-
1994 to 53.3% (95% CI, 51.3%-
55.4%) in 1999-2004 (P.001). As in
the total US population, the decreases
in HSV-1 seroprevalence in those born
in the United States did not show a con-
centration in any subpopulations.
Trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2
Coinfection Between 1988-1994
and 1999-2004
The seroprevalence of coinfection with
HSV-1 and HSV-2 decreased from
14.6% in 1988-1994 to 10.5% in 1999-
2004 (P.001). In contrast, the sero-
prevalence of HSV-2 only did not

in 1999-2004). As a result, the percent-
age of HSV-2 infected persons who
lacked HSV-1 antibodies increased
from 30.4% in 1988-1994 to 38.9% in
1999-2004 (P=.002). There were no
changes in the overall seroprevalence
of HSV-1 only. However, the percent-
age of participants seronegative for
both HSV-1 and HSV-2 increased from
32.0% in 1988-1994 to 35.4% in 1999-
2004 (P=.02). Among adolescents aged
14 to 19 years, the percentage of par-
ticipants seronegative for both HSV-1
and HSV-2 increased from 52.8% in
1988-1994 to 60.2% in 1999-2004
(P=.002).
Trends in the Diagnosis
of Genital Herpes
Theoverallpercentageofsurveypartici-
pants who reported having been diag-
nosedwithgenitalherpesdidnotchange
significantly between 1988-1994 and
1999-2004 (3.3% and 3.8%, respec-
tively).However,amongthosewhowere
HSV-2 seropositive, the percentage
reporting a diagnosis of genital herpes
increased from 9.9% in 1988-1994 to
14.3% in 1999-2004 (P=.02). The per-
centage of persons having been diag-
nosed with genital herpes increased
among those infected with HSV-2 only
and among those with both HSV-1 and
HSV-2 but the differences between the
2 surveys did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (FIGURE 2). In both 1988-
1994 and 1999-2004, persons infected
withHSV-2onlyweresignificantlymore
likely to report having been diagnosed
with genital herpes than those infected
with both HSV-1 and HSV-2. In 1988-
1994, 6.6% of those infected with both
HSV-1 and HSV-2 had been diagnosed
with genital herpes compared with
17.2%inthoseinfectedwithHSV-2only
(P=.001; Figure 2). Similarly, in 1999-
2004,11.0%ofthoseinfectedwithboth
HSV-1 and HSV-2 had been diagnosed
with genital herpes compared with
19.3%inthoseinfectedwithHSV-2only
(P.001).
A higher percentage of persons in-
fected with HSV-1 only reported hav-
ing been diagnosed with genital her-
pes in 1999-2004 than in 1988-1994
(1.8% vs 0.4%; P.001) (Figure 2).
Furthermore, in 1999-2004, a person
infected with HSV-1 only was more
likely to have been diagnosed with geni-
tal herpes compared with those serone-
gative for HSV-1 (adjusted odds ratio,
2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-5.0), while there was
no difference in 1988-1994. The mean
age for persons infected with HSV-1
only who had been diagnosed with
genital herpes was similar between
1988-1994 and 1999-2004.
Review of HSV-1 and HSV-2
Seroprevalence from 3 NHANES
In FIGURE 3, HSV-2 seroprevalence
from the 3 NHANES are presented
for non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks by age. No data were
available for Mexican Americans in
1976-1980. In non-Hispanic whites,
HSV-2 seroprevalence from the 1999-
2004 survey was not significantly
different from that observed in 1976-
1980 for any of the age groups. This
indicates that the significant increases
among participants aged 14 to 19
years, 20 to 29 years, and 30 to 39
years25 between 1976-1980 and 1988-
1994 had all been reversed (Figure 3).
There were no statistically significant
differences in HSV-2 seroprevalence in
non-Hispanic blacks between the 3 sur-
veys (Figure 3).
Between 1976-1980 and 1999-
2004, HSV-1 seroprevalence has been
decreasing in both non-Hispanic whites
and non-Hispanic blacks. When all
age groups were combined, the test
for trend was significant for non-
Hispanic whites (P.001) and non-
Hispanic blacks (P.001; FIGURE 4);

COMMENT
The seroprevalence of HSV-2 in the
United States decreased by 19% in per-
sons aged 14 to 49 years over an aver-
age interval of 10.5 years. The change
in HSV-2 seroprevalence contrasts
sharply with data from a previous re-
port, which found that HSV-2 sero-
prevalence increased 30% between the
2 NHANES conducted in 1976-1980
and 1988-1994.25 Our study suggests
that the trajectory of increasing HSV-2
seroprevalence in the United States has
been reversed.
Because HSV-2 is a lifetime infec-
tion,anyincreasesordecreasesinHSV-2
seroprevalence are expected to be first
seen in younger persons. In adoles-
cents and younger adults, HSV-2 sero-
prevalenceisacumulativemeasureofre-

cent exposures. The decrease in HSV-2
seroprevalenceinadolescentsandyoung
adults provides biological evidence sup-
porting findings from behavioral sur-
veys that sexual risk behaviors de-
creased in adolescents.36 Seroprevalence
of HSV-2 is not subject to self-reporting
biases, and is a more direct measure of
risk for sexually acquired HIV infec-
tion. Because audio computer-assisted
self-interviewing increases the report-
ing of sexual behaviors in adoles-
cents,37 the change in methods likely
made the reporting of sexual activities
more complete in 1999-2004. As a re-
sult,theobserveddecreasesinsexualbe-
haviorsinadolescentsbetweenthe2sur-
veys are likely to be underestimates.
The reasons that HSV-2 seropreva-
lence significantly decreased even af-
ter accounting for changes in mea-
sured sexual behaviors may include a
combination of unmeasured factors,
such as careful partner selection, con-
dom use, and/or choosing oral sex over
vaginal sex36,38-41; additionally, adjust-
ing for individual-level behavioral
changes may not fully adjust for their
population effects. Recent research into
the structure of sexual networks indi-
cates that in adolescents, relative low
levels of behavioral change can radi-
cally limit the spread of sexually trans-
mitted infections.42 The finding that the
mean number of lifetime sex partners
increased in adult females but did not
change in adult males may have con-
tributed to the greater decreases in
HSV-2 seroprevalence in males rela-
tive to females between the 2 surveys.
The overall seroprevalence of HSV-1
decreasedby7%between1988-1994and
1999-2004. During the same interval,
there was an increase in persons in-
fectedwithHSV-1onlywhohadbeendi-
agnosed with genital herpes. Our find-
ings are consistent with previous reports
thatgenitalherpescausedbyHSV-1may
be increasing in the United States, as in
other developed countries.6-13
A decrease in HSV-1 seroprevalence
intheUnitedStatesisnotunexpecteddue
to improvements in living and hygiene
conditions and experiences in other
developedcountries.InEuropeancoun-
tries,HSV-1seroprevalencewasinversely
correlatedwiththenationalgrossdomes-
ticproduct.43 IntheUnitedKingdomand
in the Netherlands, the seroprevalence
of HSV-1 has decreased since the late
1980s.44,45 In Japan, changes in socio-
economic status and family size were
associatedwithdecreasesinHSV-1sero-
prevalence.46 The overall seropreva-
lenceofHSV-1wasunchangedbetween
1976-1980 and 1988-1994, probably
becauseimmigrantsfromcountrieswith
high HSV-1 seroprevalence offset the
decrease in HSV-1 seroprevalence in
those born in the United States.26 Our
finding that HSV-1 seroprevalence
decreased overall by 7% but by 10% in
those born in the United States sup-
ports this hypothesis.
The changing HSV-1 seropreva-
lence may have an impact on genital
herpesforseveralreasons.First,declines
in HSV-1 acquisition before onset of
sexual activity will leave more indi-
vidualssusceptibletogenitallyacquired
HSV-1 infection when they become
sexually active. Second, more individu-

outHSV-1antibodies.Despitetheover-
all decrease in HSV-2 seroprevalence
between1988-1994and1999-2004,the
seroprevalence of HSV-2 only (the
groupofpersonswiththehighestmedi-
cal burden of genital herpes) did not
change. Finally, because genital HSV-1
recurs relatively infrequently, confir-
mation of HSV type may contribute to
optimal management of patients with
symptomatic genital herpes.47,48
One limitation of our study is the
small number of questions about sexual
behaviors in NHANES. We cannot com-
pare rates of condom use because such
data were not collected in the surveys.
Another limitation is that the interpre-
tation of national trends can be prob-
lematic for Mexican Americans due to
the recent arrival of a large number of
immigrants in the United States.49
While our data show declines in
HSV-2 seroprevalence, HSV-2 is still
prevalent in the United States. Further-
more, the gaps in HSV-2 seropreva-
lence between the sexes are widening
and the disparity between racial groups
persists despite the recent decrease in
HSV-2 seroprevalence. There are sev-
eral additions to the armamentarium for
control of HSV-2 infection. A candi-
date vaccine that is partially protec-
tive in women has been reported.24
Once-daily HSV-2 suppressive therapy
can cut the risk of HSV-2 transmis-
sion in discordant couples by half,50 and
condoms use can also reduce the risk
of transmission.39,40
Type-specific serological tests for
HSV have become available51 and can
be used to identify populations in need
of intensified interventions. Trials are
ongoing to assess the impact of HSV-2
suppressive therapy on HIV acquisi-
tion.52 If effective, HSV-2 suppressive
therapy may become a new biomedi-
cal intervention limiting the spread of
HIV as well as HSV-2 infection. The per-
centage of HSV-2 seropositive persons
who had been diagnosed with genital
herpes was higher in 1999-2004 com-
pared with 1988-1994. However, the
vast majority of persons seropositive for
HSV-2 did not know that they were in-
fected. These data are consistent with
the lack of widespread testing in the
general population.
NHANES provide a measure of popu-
lationburdensofbothHSV-1andHSV-2
infections.Inpopulationsinwhichchild-
hood acquisition of HSV-1 is common,
such as in non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans, sexual transmis-
sion of HSV-1 would be minimal. How-
ever, in populations whose acquisition
of HSV-1 during childhood is relatively
low and who have relatively low HSV-2
seroprevalence, such as non-Hispanic
whites, sexual transmission of HSV-1
could become an increasingly impor-
tant cause of genital herpes in the fu-
ture.Recentchangesinadolescentsexual
behavior(particularlythepracticeoforal-
genital sex) and the possible evolution
of HSV-1 may accelerate this shift.41,42,53
The ability to monitor HSV-1 seroprev-
alence along with HSV-2 seropreva-
lence in NHANES is important for the
development of HSV-2 prevention strat-
egies, such as those related to vaccina-
tion.24 The changes in HSV-1 and HSV-2
seroprevalencewillalsodirectlyaffectthe
cause of neonatal herpes.54 Future stud-
ies are needed to monitor the changing
HSV-1 and HSV-2 trends and to de-
velop effective strategies to prevent HSV
infection.
