Abstract
Background: The Organizational Process Improvement Intervention (OPII), conducted by the NIDA-funded Criminal
Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies consortium of nine research centers, examined an organizational intervention
to improve the processes used in correctional settings to assess substance abusing offenders, develop case plans,
transfer this information to community-based treatment agencies, and monitor the services provided by these
community based treatment agencies.
Methods/Design: A multi-site cluster randomized design was used to evaluate an inter-agency organizational process
improvement intervention among dyads of correctional agencies and community based treatment agencies. Linked
correctional and community based agencies were clustered among nine (9) research centers and randomly assigned
to an early or delayed intervention condition. Participants included administrators, managers, and line staff from the
participating agencies; some participants served on interagency change teams while other participants performed
agency tasks related to offender services. A manualized organizational intervention that includes the use of external
organizational coaches was applied to create and support interagency change teams that proceeded through a
four-step process over a planned intervention period of 12 months. The primary outcome of the process improvement
intervention was to improve processes associated with the assessment, case planning, service referral and service
provision processes within the linked organizations.
Discussion: Providing substance abuse offenders with coordinated treatment and access to community-based services
is critical to reducing offender recidivism. Results from this study protocol will provide new and critical information on
strategies and processes that improve the assessment and case planning for such offenders as they transition between
correctional and community based systems and settings. Further, this study extends current knowledge of and
methods for, the study of evidence-based practice adoption and implementation.

Background
Screening and assessment are clinical processes used to
detect and then determine the extent, pervasiveness, or
severity of presenting problems or issues by patients in a
variety of health and other service settings. For indivi-
duals engaged in criminal justice or correctional systems,
these screening and assessment processes should identify
and evaluate criminogenic risks, including mental health
and drug abuse problems, in order to tailor correctional
supervision and rehabilitative services to those who
need them (Lowenkamp and Latessa 2005; Taxman and
Thanner 2006; Welsh and Zajac 2004). Several screening
and assessment tools have been validated for use in both
substance abuse treatment and correctional programs.
These instruments assess static and dynamic individual
factors that can aid in informing the intensity and course
of substance abuse treatment and correctional supervi-
sion that is expressed in an offender case plan. Linking
screening and assessment information to offender case
plans is a cornerstone of the Risk-Need-Responsivity
principle, a feature of evidence-based correctional pro-
gramming (Andrews et al. 1990).
There is some evidence that the assessment and case
planning processes used in criminal justice and correc-
tional settings are less than optimal (Taxman, Cropsey
et al. 2007; Taxman, Perdoni and Harrison 2007; Belenko
and Peugh 2005). In one recent national survey, only 58%
of institutional correctional agencies (prisons and jails)
in the United States reported use of standardized assess-
ment instruments, with community correctional agencies
(probation and parole) showing even lower rates of
utilization (Taxman, Cropsey et al. 2007). The lack of val-
idated screening and assessment processes in correc-
tional settings represents a significant threat to the
overall effectiveness of correctional services. In the ab-
sence of effective offender assessment processes, re-
sponsive supervision and treatment plans cannot be
developed, putting the offender at risk of re-offending,
and the public at risk of victimization and crime.
Systematic approaches to organizational change within
correctional and criminal justice settings date back to
the 1960s with a focus on prison reform and community
policing (Duffee et al. 1986; Toch 1969; Toch et al.
1975). Nonetheless, rigorous research related to the im-
plementation of specific, targeted, evidence-based super-
vision and/or clinical practices is lacking in criminal
justice systems. The supervision and clinical practices
associated with the assessment, case planning, and refer-
ral to community-based substance abuse treatment of
offenders is an important dimension of the criminal just-
ice system. These practices take on particular import-
ance when one considers the growth in the offender
population in general, the prevalence of community cor-
rectional supervision, the high prevalence of substance
use disorders among individuals under correctional
supervision, and the resulting reliance on interagency
(correctional-treatment) models of service delivery
(Klofas et al. 2010).
Aims and objectives
The aim of this study is to test an interagency implemen-
tation strategy in linked correctional and community-
based treatment systems to improve the assessment and
case planning processes that these agencies and their staff
perform as they coordinate substance abuse treatment
and services for offenders transitioning between these two
systems. Since correctional and community-based treat-
ment systems are heavily influenced by state-level policies
and funding resources, a randomized cluster design, with
clusters formed at the state level, controls for the effects
of the exogenous policy environment. The implementa-
tion strategy consists of externally facilitated orga-
nizational coaching and interagency Local Change Teams
(LCTs) that include individuals in staff and managerial po-
sitions from correctional and community treatment agen-
cies. The objectives of this study are threefold: (1)
improve the quality of the assessment and case planning
processes of correctional-based agencies; (2) assess the ef-
fectiveness of an externally facilitated, interagency change
team process in implementing targeted process improve-
ments; and (3) evaluate the impacts and determinants of
this change process upon staff behavior, attitudes, and
quality of assessment and case planning processes.
Significance
The social significance of this study lies in its context
within criminal justice systems and its focus on the pro-
cesses of offender assessment and case referral, an inter-
agency juncture long recognized to be faulty and ill-
devised (Taxman, Cropsey et al. 2007; Taxman, Perdoni
and Harrison 2007). As society continues to grapple with
the explosion in incarceration and community supervi-
sion, it is critical to identify more effective and efficient
processes and procedures for correctional systems to
better assess the needs of offenders and to provide this
information to community-based providers to enable
them to deliver evidence-based treatment to offenders.
The utilization of organizational coaching and external
facilitation has been well documented in the research lit-
erature, and change teams have been a common element
in implementation change processes, but the facilitation
of interagency change teams, which involve the needs,
abilities, and priorities of different systems of care, such
as correctional agencies and treatment programs, has
been less well studied (Aarons et al. 2009).
The research significance of this study lies in its
application of an innovative research design and the
utilization of multi-method measurement processes to

study community-generated process improvement targets.
The diversity of process improvement action targets taken
on by the LCTs and the reliance upon newly developed
non-psychometrically validated instrumentation cre-
ates potentially significant analytic and interpretation
challenges. The lessons learned from this study may
contribute to a better understanding of appropriate
and efficacious methodological approaches to the study
of organizational change and implementation.
Methods/Design
Intervention
The OPII tested the effects of an organizational imple-
mentation strategy upon improvements in an intervention
strategy, consistent with the emergent field of implemen-
tation research that distinguishes intervention strategies
(those activities delivered to program recipients) from
implementation strategies (those activities delivered to or-
ganizations and providers delivering the intervention
strategy) (Proctor et al. 2009). The intervention strategy
that we targeted was the linked processes of offender as-
sessment, case planning, and referral to community based
treatment shared by correctional agencies and linked
community based treatment agencies. The implementa-
tion strategy tested was an organizational intervention
consisting of externally facilitated organizational coaching
provided to interagency LCTs.
The implementation strategy of the OPII is similar to
the NIATx model that uses a change team and coach to
bring about process improvements in behavioral health
settings (McCarty et al. 2007). However, the OPII differs
from the NIATx model in the following ways: (1) the fa-
cilitator in OPII was more engaged with the LCT than a
NIATx coach would be; (2) the OPII had defined phases
with phase-specific activities and reports in contrast to
the more open-ended process of NIATx; (3) the OPII
did not use rapid-cycle testing, Plan-Do-Study-Act
(PDSA) processes, which are core elements of NIATx;
and (4) the OPII targeted interagency change team pro-
cesses (corrections and treatment) while NIATx involves
a single agency.
Each LCT was made up of individuals from a partici-
pating correctional agency and at least one community-
based substance abuse treatment agency that received
referrals from the correctional agency. The LCT ranged
in size from 6 to 10 individuals, and included individuals
with responsibility for the assessment, case planning,
referral processing, and substance abuse treatment plan-
ning functions. The size and composition of LCTs
depended upon the local context and the organizational
characteristics of the participating correctional and pro-
vider agencies.
Each LCT had a Local Change Team Leader (LCTL).
The individual designated for this position was expected
to have direct line communications to the chief execu-
tive officer (e.g. commissioner, chief probation officer,
parole board chair, or parole director) of the corrections
partner agency in which the OPII was being conducted.
The LCTL served as the communication and decision-
making pipeline with the corrections agency CEO and
facilitated logistical and operational change processes
identified by the LCT.
The facilitator was an individual who worked with the
LCT throughout the organizational improvement pro-
cess. Each research center, in cooperation with the rele-
vant correctional agency partner, selected facilitators
who were under the employ of the RC. In general, facili-
tators had previously worked directly with agency pro-
viders in some capacity and possessed credentials and
experience that provided credibility with the LCT.
Facilitators helped LCTs stay on track and on task as
they engaged in a structured, five-phase model of as-
sessing and improving the quality of their interagency
assessment and case planning mechanisms within cor-
rectional and community treatment systems. The five
structured phases of the OPII and the planned duration
of each phase were as follows: (1) Team Development
(1Â­2 months); (2) Needs Assessment (3Â­4 months); (3)
Process Improvement Planning (3Â­4 months); (4) Imple-
mentation (6 months); and (5) Follow-Up/Sustainability
(6 months).
During the Needs Assessment phase, the LCT engaged
in a variety of information gathering and group decision-
making techniques to critically examine and prioritize gaps
or capacities in four core quality dimensions of their
shared assessment and case planning processes: (1) Was
the correctional agency using evidence-based and vali-
dated means for assessing the needs of offenders? (2) Were
these needs identified and prioritized in the resulting case
plans developed by the correctional agency? (3) Did the
correctional agency share this assessment and case plan
information with their referring community-based treat-
ment providers, and did the providers find this informa-
tion useful? (4) Did the community based agency provide
services that addressed the needs of the offenders? The
LCT, with assistance provided by the facilitator, used infor-
mation gathered during the Needs Assessment to identify
improvement goals, created a Process Improvement Plan
(PIP), and carried out the implementation activities
they had set out for themselves (see Table 1). During the
Sustainability phase, the LCT developed a plan to continue
implementation activities and the planned withdrawal of
the facilitator. During this phase, attention was paid to
determining if continuing work on the PIP goals was
needed, if new goals were needed, and whether the LCT
process would continue.
Cross-site fidelity among those individuals serving as
facilitators was attained through three mechanisms.

First, a facilitators' manuala was developed prior to the
launch of the study. Second, weekly learning circle calls
among the facilitators, which included discussion of site
updates and group problem-solving of organizational
impediments and challenges, assisted in enhancing cohe-
sion and consistency in approach. Third, a secure web-
portal utilized by the facilitators to report the frequency,
duration, and type of contacts that they had with mem-
bers of their change teams, along with descriptive pro-
gress notes, allowed the research team to monitor the
activities of the facilitators.
Nine research centers (RC) participated in this study,
with each RC comprised of correctional/criminal justice
(CJ) agencies, community-based treatment agencies, and
researchers. The role of each RC in the OPII study was
to create and participate in the implementation strategy
and to participate in workgroups that addressed issues
such as implementation, data collection and quality, ana-
lysis, and publication. Resources and incentives provided
by the research centers to the CJ and community pro-
viders varied across centers, but included opportunity
and nominal funding for education (continuing educa-
tion units), improvements in delivery of services, and de-
velopment of an implementation process that could be
used after the research was completed.
Research design
Evaluation of the OPII used a multi-site cluster random-
ized design. Organizational clusters consisted of linked
correctional and one or more community-based sub-
stance abuse treatment agencies providing correctional
and substance abuse treatment services to common cli-
ents. Nine research centers contributed at least two clus-
ters both of which were located within the same state. In
this design, one cluster was randomly assigned to an early
start condition, and the other cluster was assigned to a de-
layed start condition (see Figure 1). Randomization as-
signment was conducted by the cross center research
workgroup using the randomization function in Excel for
each research center prior to their kick-off meeting. Early-
Start sites began the OPII, while the Delayed-Start sites
maintained business as usual without any additional inter-
vention. The Delayed-Start LCT was supposed to begin
the OPII after approximately 12 months, or when the
Early-Start site LCT had completed the Implementation
phase of the OPII. The time required for each LCT to
complete each phase of the OPII varied, based upon the
existing cohesion among the LCT members, local con-
textual factors, and the complexity of the system and
resulting goals set by the LCT. Within each research cen-
ter, the Early and Delayed-Start sites were chosen so their
systems of care were relatively independent.
Cluster randomization designs are more complex than
randomization at the individual level, in part because
intra-cluster inter-correlations (e.g., individual-level fac-
tors) introduce a design effect that must be estimated
for sample size determinations and incorporated into
analyses of study data (Glynn et al. 2007). However,
Table 1 Core dimensions of the assessment continuum
Measurement and
instrumentation
This dimension is concerned with the breadth and quality of instruments that a correctional agency uses to identify the
strengths, weaknesses, and service needs of substance-using offenders. Nine domains have been identified as being
fundamental to a high quality assessment of offenders with substance use disorders:
1. History and patterns of substance abuse
2. History of and engagement in drug treatment
3. Motivation for treatment
4. History of mental illness
5. Suitability for pharmacological treatment
6. Medical history
7. HIV/AIDS status and risk factors
8. Criminal behavior
9. Criminogenic risk factors
In addition to focusing on the comprehensiveness of the assessment, this dimension is also concerned with the
psychometric properties of the instruments.
Integration with the
case plan
This dimension is concerned with the extent to which the correctional case plan explicitly addresses each of the nine
assessment domains. It also seeks to gauge efficacy and suitability to the needs of the offender as called for in the written
problem statement, goals, objectives, and suggested interventions.
Conveyance and
utility
This dimension is concerned with the extent to which community-based treatment programs receive the information
contained in the corrections agency case plan and with the degree to which the programs find the information useful in
arranging services for clients.
Service activation/
provision
This dimension is concerned with whether the client is engaged in community treatment, with the type and nature of
services received, and with communication between agencies about the treatment.

cluster randomized designs are well suited to studies in
which the intervention is targeted at the organizational ra-
ther than at the client level, as was the case for the OPII.
Initially, the Delayed-Start sites served as the comparison
for the Early-Start sites in that they continued to conduct
their assessment, case planning, and referral procedures as
usual. Since these procedures varied considerably across
the correctional systems involved in the study, there was
no uniform comparison condition across all sites.
Sample
The CJDATS research centers each recruited two cor-
rectional agencies, and each correctional agency had one
or more community treatment providers. Correctional
settings included prisons, probation and parole units.
Most (19) of the participating correctional settings
served adults, but two of them served juveniles. There
are 10 sites (clusters) in each study condition, for a total
of 21 study sites.b As indicated earlier, staff members
participating in the LCT included representatives from
both correctional and community-based treatment agen-
cies who conducted assessments and/or prepared case
plans and those who held management or clinical super-
vision positions. Each LCT included 6Â­10 staff mem-
bers. Thus, the total number of LCT members ranged
from about 120 to 240. Although the LCT members
were the main participants in the study, correctional and
treatment staff who were not members of the LCT were
included in the administration of some of the surveys.
Data collection and measures
Outcomes
The outcomes of primary interest were those related to
change in the intervention being provided to offenders,
namely, assessment and case planning processes. Mea-
sures of intervention outcomes included congruence be-
tween assessed needs and case plan recommendations,
quality of the content of the case plan, conveyance of
case plans to community treatment providers, and
cross-organizational coordination.

Also of interest were the implementation outcomes of
the facilitated change intervention process itself, which are
related to fidelity and acceptability of the activities of the
OPII. It was hypothesized that success in achieving process
improvement goals, with regard to the assessment and case
planning process, were dependent upon commitment to
the intervention by members of the LCT, satisfaction with
the facilitation, executive management support, interagency
collaboration, and the quality and intensity of facilitation.
Quantitative data collection
Quantitative data collected for this study included struc-
tured ratings of correctional agency offender case plans
and surveys of members of the LCT and other
organizational staff in the participating agencies.
Case plan ratings The Assessment and Recommenda-
tions for Treatment Rating Form (ART/RF) provided rat-
ings of four quality dimensions of the case plans. These
dimensions included: (1) Measurement (the problem or
service needs assessed by a given agency); (2) Integration
with the Case Plan (the degree to which the case plan tar-
gets needs identified); (3) Conveyance (evidence that the
case plan was shared with the community based treat-
ment provider); and (4) Services Activation (evidence that
the community-based treatment provider delivered ser-
vices in accordance with the needs identified in the case
plan). Case plan ratings were collected before the start of
the intervention (baseline), during the intervention (Needs
Assessment phase, Process Improvement Plan phase, Im-
plementation phase), and during the Sustainability/Fol-
low-up phase. In each period, research staff randomly
selected five case plans per month from agency records
and rated them using the ART-RF. Case plans from the
Delayed-Start sites were rated during the same period of
time as for the Early-Start sites. Composite scores for each
of the four quality dimensions were calculated for the five
cases sampled each month, generating four ratings (Meas-
urement, Integration, Conveyance, and Services Activa-
tion) per month.
BSOC Scales The Baseline Survey of Organizational
Characteristics (BSOC) describes the organizational
characteristics, climate, and culture of the participating
sites across the three CJDATS studies (the OPII study,
as described here, the MATICCE study, which was de-
signed to improve access to medication-assisted treat-
ment, and the HIV-STIC study, which was intended to
improve the HIV continuum of care). The BSOC was
adapted from previously developed and validated instru-
mentation, including the TCU Survey of Organizational
Functioning (TCU-SOF) (Lehman et al. 2002). There are
different versions of the BSOC, with item wording tai-
lored to the type of respondent: treatment staff,
correctional staff, treatment director, and correctional
director. In addition, treatment executive and correc-
tional executive versions of the BSOC collected data on
number of staff, staff turnover, types of services pro-
vided, admissions, caseload, and budget.
Other surveys Other survey instruments (listed in
Table 2) provide information on staff perceptions of the
assessment-case planning process, conveyance and use
of assessments and case plans by community treatment
agencies, goal commitment by members of the LCT,
working alliance between the facilitator and members of
the LCT, completion of implementation tasks per phase,
perceived management support for the process improve-
ment process, and staff satisfaction with the OPII. To as-
sess costs of the intervention, members of the LCT were
asked to report monthly on the number of hours they
spent on LCT activities.
Qualitative data collection
Semi-structured interviews with members of the LCTs
and other staff (front-line staff, and administrators) of
the participating agencies were conducted periodically
throughout the OPII intervention, specifically at the end
of the Process Improvement Planning Phases, the end of
the Implementation Phase and at the end of the Sustain-
ability/Follow-Up Phase. Respondent interviews were
valuable to understand and clarify the experiences, moti-
vations, and underlying attitudes of participants involved
in change projects (Tracy 2013). The interviews, which
were conducted across all research sites, followed stan-
dardized interview guides for each phase of the project
focused, although interviewers were encouraged to use a
"conversational give-and-take" style (Lindlof and Taylor
2002) to probe for additional detail and ask clarifying
questions when necessary. Interview guides focused on
the respondents' experiences with and perspectives re-
garding the implementation of the OPII, both from an in-
sider (LCT member) and outsider (line staff, administrator)
perspectives, and asked respondents to report about
important issues including, for example: LCT cohesion
and group process, specific goals and their feasibility,
personal and team participation, facilitator strengths/
weaknesses, effects of the change process, etc. These
interviews were particularly useful for identifying unantici-
pated factors that affected the success of the change
process.
Interviews were conducted by members of each re-
search center, either in person or over the phone. Inter-
views were audio recorded, transcribed, fact-checked,
stripped of identifying information, and then analyzed
using a multi-part group and individual coding process.

Aims and/or hypotheses
Hypotheses
The primary hypotheses of the study are that enhance-
ments or improvements in each of the following out-
comes occur only after the introduction of a specific and
structured process improvement initiative (OPII):
1. The level of congruence between transitional
offender assessments and case plans.
2. The level of presence of accepted principles of case
plan development in case plans.
3. The percentage of case plans forwarded from
correctional agencies to community treatment
programs.
4. The level of the use of case plans by community-
based substance abuse treatment programs.
5. Staff perceptions of the assessment-case planning
process.
Secondary hypotheses are concerned with factors affect-
ing the degree of success that LCTs experienced in achiev-
ing the goals they established for themselves. LCTs'

success in achieving the goals for their Process Improve-
ment Plans (PIP) were expected to be positively related to:
1. The degree to which LCTs exhibit fidelity to the
designated elements of OPII.
2. The degree of commitment by LCT members to
achieving the goals of the plan.
3. The level of staff satisfaction with the
implementation strategy.
4. The degree of management support within the
organization for the intervention.
5. The strength of the working alliance between the
facilitator and the LCT.
Implementation questions
The implementation questions for the OPII study in-
clude: (1) How are implementation outcomes related to
variations across states in system characteristics, config-
urations of LCTs, assessment processes, and study im-
plementation? (2) Were the improvements in assessment
and case planning procedures identified by each LCT
implemented as intended? (3) What does the OPII cost
in terms of staff time devoted to designing and imple-
menting the PIP? (4) Are OPII-initiated changes in as-
sessment and case planning sustained following the end
of the intervention? (5) In what ways does collaboration
between organizations involved in the OPII change over
the course of the intervention?
Human subject protections
Each research center obtained Institutional Review Board
approval through an established FWA-recognized entity.
In most instances, approvals were also secured from par-
ticipating correctional and/or treatment agency research/
IRB committees. Informed consent was obtained by re-
search participants, including staff and managers of par-
ticipating agencies, at varying points of time throughout
the study, depending upon data collection requirements.
Baseline structured staff surveys and corresponding par-
ticipant consent were administered at the time of the kick
off meeting of the early start site for participants of both
the Early-Start and Delayed-Start sites. Qualitative inter-
views occurred after the randomization. ART-RF case rat-
ings samples began six months prior to randomization;
since the ratings did not collect personal identifying infor-
mation, but rather agency documentation patterns, of-
fender consent was not required.
Discussion
The organizational intervention under study in this paper
will extend the use of interagency LCTs and externally fa-
cilitated organizational coaching to enhance the shared
processes of assessment, case planning, service referral,
and treatment provision processes between correctional
agencies and community based treatment agencies. This
study will generate and extend knowledge related to the
science of implementation and organizational change in
at least four key areas.
First, the study will provide some of the first evidence of
the effectiveness of change teams and facilitated coaching
strategies to bring about changes in organizational pro-
cesses (specifically assessment and case planning) within
correctional systems. While the utilization of orga-
nizational coaching and facilitation has been recognized
as an effective organizational change process in correc-
tional systems (National Institute of Corrections 2001),
scant empirical evidence exists of its impact in promoting
adoption and implementation of evidence-supported
practice.
Second, the application of organizational change strat-
egies such as change teams, and process improvement
initiatives, such as NIATx, typically target change pro-
cesses within a single organization. This study targets
organizational processes within and between systems and
agencies; criminal justice/correctional agencies and pri-
vate, mostly non-profit community-based treatment agen-
cies. The interagency contexts of this study, coupled with
the divergence in organizational culture between correc-
tional and treatment settings, provide unique context
within which to study the complexities of bringing about
enhancements in the delivery of evidence-supported client
level interventions.
Third, this study provides a highly structured and rigor-
ous approach to ensuring and documenting the fidelity of
the facilitated intervention, including the development of
a facilitation intervention manual and learning circles
among the facilitators. These enhancements introduce sig-
nificant opportunities to better understand the nature and
quality of effective organizational facilitation.
Fourth, this study extends methodological approaches
to the inquiry of implementation and organizational im-
provement in a number of ways. As noted, the use of
non-validated instrumentation, most notably in the case
file review process (ART-RF), but also nearly all of the
survey measures, present major risks and challenges to
the analysis and interpretation processes. Nonetheless,
the focused efforts at construct triangulation, drawing
upon multi-methods data collection (survey, chart ab-
straction, qualitative interviews) provide the potential for
advancing measurement sophistication in this nascent
field of inquiry. The reflective nature of our intervention
design, one in which the speed at which the LCTs pro-
gress through the planned phases of the intervention,
as well as the targeting of the process improvement
goals selected by each LCT, present significant risks and
challenges to analysis and interpretation. Finally, given
the local setting context within which these LCTs are
formed, the potential for spillover or generalization

effects between early start and local start sites is an area
for concern. For each of these methodological risks and
liabilities, we have taken efforts to anticipate and guard
against the most egregious risks, and we hope, in the
process, to make significant contribution to the study of
organizational improvement and implementation in gen-
eral and within the unique context of correctional set-
tings in particular.
