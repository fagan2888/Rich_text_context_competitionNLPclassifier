THE ADDITION OF SMOKING TO
the list of nationally notifiable
health conditions in 1996 rec-
ognized the role of tobacco use
as the leading preventable cause of
death in the United States.1,2 For sev-
eral reasons, the public health im-
plications of smoking are potentially
compounded for women. Tobacco is as-
sociated with many adverse reproduc-
tive health effects in women, includ-
ing adverse effects on pregnancy.3,4
Exposure to tobacco during the prena-
tal period and to environmental to-
bacco smoke during the postnatal pe-
riod are leading causes of mortality and
morbidity, including problem behav-
iors, among children.4-6
Most women who quit smoking dur-
ing pregnancy do so on their own.3,7
Nevertheless, most smokers do not quit
smoking during their pregnancy.3,7 Pre-
natal smoking cessation programs have
been shown to increase quitting rates;
however, postpartum relapse rates are
very high.7-9 Although the prevalence
of smoking in the United States has de-
clined since the 1980s, it has in-
creased among adolescents and young
adults.2,10-12 Therefore, it is not known
whether progress has been made to-
ward achieving the desired reduction
in the national prevalence of smoking
by year 2000 among pregnant women
and women of childbearing age.13
To assess recent temporal trends in
pregnancy-related differences in the
prevalence of smoking, we compared
smoking behaviors of pregnant women
with those of nonpregnant women of re-
productive age. This report is based on
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys-
tem (BRFSS)14 data from 33 states that
collected information on smoking each
year from 1987 through 1996. These
states represent all of the major US geo-
graphicalregionsandcontainaboutthree
fourths of the US population.15

Context Rates of smoking are increasing among adolescents and young adults, but
trends in smoking among pregnant women have not been studied.
Objective To assess pregnancy-related variations in smoking behaviors and their de-
terminants among women of childbearing age in the United States.
Design Analysis of data collected between 1987-1996 from the Behavioral Risk Fac-
tor Surveillance System survey.
Setting and Subjects A total of 187 302 (178 499 nonpregnant and 8803 preg-
nant) noninstitutionalized women aged 18 to 44 years from 33 states.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence rates of smoking initiation and current smok-
ing, median number of cigarettes smoked, and adjusted odds ratios for smoking strati-
fied by pregnancy status; prevalence rate ratio for current smoking comparing preg-
nant with nonpregnant women.
Results The overall percentage of women who had ever initiated smoking de-
creased significantly from 44.1% in 1987 to 38.2% in 1996. During that 10-year pe-
riod, the prevalence of current smoking also decreased significantly among both preg-
nant women (16.3% to 11.8%) and nonpregnant women (26.7% to 23.6%). Overall,
pregnant women were about half (54%) as likely as nonpregnant women to be cur-
rent smokers during 1987-1996. Over time, the median number of cigarettes smoked
per day by pregnant smokers remained at 10, whereas among nonpregnant smokers
it decreased from 19 to 15 (P.05 for trend). In the same period, among young women
(aged 18-20 years), prevalence rates of smoking initiation and current smoking in-
creased slightly. Sociodemographic subgroups of women at increased risk for current
smoking were the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women (ie, those with a com-
pleted high school education or less, whites, and those who were unmarried).
Conclusions In this analysis, the decline in smoking over time among pregnant women
was primarily due to the overall decline in smoking initiation rates among women of
childbearing age, not to an increased rate of smoking cessation related to pregnancy.
To foster effective perinatal tobacco control, efforts are needed to further reduce the
number of young women who begin smoking. Clinicians should query all pregnant
women and women of childbearing age about smoking and provide cessation and re-
lapse interventions to each smoker.

risk behaviors related primarily to
chronic diseases. Designed to produce
risk factor estimates for the noninsti-
tutionalized civilian population aged 18
years or older, it provides baseline data
for setting national health promotion
and disease prevention objectives.13 The
sampling weights used in the BRFSS are
based on the probability of selection and
adjusted for nonresponses and dispro-
portionate sampling of subgroups rela-
tive to the state's population. The me-
dian response rate to the survey (ratio
of completed interviews to the sum of
completed interviews and refusals) dur-
ing the study period varied between
80% and 85%.
In this analysis, ever smokers (smok-
ing initiation) were defined as those
who responded "yes" to the opening
question on smoking: "Have you
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your
entire life?" Current smokers were de-
fined as ever smokers who responded
"yes" to the question "Do you smoke
cigarettes now?" (which was asked each
year from 1987 to 1995) or who re-
sponded "everyday" or "some days" to
the question "Do you smoke ciga-
rettes every day, some days, or not at
all?" (which was asked during 1996).
The median number of cigarettes cur-
rently smoked was calculated from par-
ticipants' responses to the question "On
the average, how many cigarettes a day
do you smoke?" Women who were clas-
sified as having quit16 smoking were
those who had initiated smoking but
were not current smokers. As an indi-
rect measure of motivation to quit
smoking,16 we obtained the percent-
age of current smokers who had at-
tempted to quit16 smoking, which was
based on participants' response to the
question "During the past 12 months,
have you quit smoking for 1 day or
longer?" asked from 1992 on. Heavy
smoking was defined as smoking 20 or
more cigarettes per day. A question on
pregnancy status ("To your knowl-
edge, are you now pregnant?") was
asked after all questions on smoking
and alcohol use.
Analyses
We aggregated the weighted state-
specific data from women aged 18 to
44 years from the 33 states selected for
this analysis. From the total sample, we
obtained the percentages of women
who reported ever smoking (smoking
initiation rate), were current smokers,
and had quit smoking. We used 3 mea-
sures to assess annual differences in cur-
rent smoking behaviors between preg-
nant women and nonpregnant women:
the prevalence rate ratio (PRR), the me-
dian number of cigarettes smoked by
current smokers, and the adjusted odds
ratio; we used the latter measure to
identify sociodemographic subgroups
of women at differential risk for smok-
ing. In the absence of information on
each woman's smoking habits before
and after planning or recognizing a
pregnancy, the PRR provides an indi-
rect measure of the magnitude of the
reduction in smoking prevalence after
women recognize they are pregnant
(pregnancy-related reduction). A PRR
close to zero indicates the greatest preg-
nancy-related reduction in smoking.
The overall rates of smoking initia-
tion, current smoking, and quitting
were age-adjusted to the age distribu-
tion of pregnant women in 1987
(TABLE 1). To examine variations in
current smoking among sociodemo-
graphic subgroups and time trends in
current smoking within those sub-
groups, we conducted analyses strati-
fied by age, education, race, marital sta-
tus,andemploymentstatus.Using these
variables as independent variables, we
created multiple logistic regression
models to calculate adjusted odds ra-
tios for current smoking separately for
pregnant and nonpregnant women. Al-
though a given odds ratio may over-
state the strength of an association com-
pared with the corresponding PRR, it
is a valid measure for identifying so-
ciodemographic subgroups at low or
high risk for smoking. We used
SUDAAN17 to obtain valid estimates of
SEs. We created weighted least squares
linear regression models (using the in-
verse of the variance estimates for
weights) to determine the statistical sig-
nificance of trends over time. A P value
less than .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant for all analyses. Be-
cause most outcome measures showed

dar year or no significant secular varia-

ses are reported only for the beginning
and ending years.
RESULTS
Study Sample
Of the 188 541 women aged 18 to 44
years who responded to the survey dur-
ing the 10-year period, we excluded 793
(4.2%) who were not sure of their preg-
nancy status and 446 (2.4%) who chose
not to answer the question on preg-
nancy. Between 1987 and 1996, the ac-
tual number of respondents increased
from 712 (weighted estimate, 1.7 mil-
lion) to 980 (weighted estimate, 1.7 mil-
lion) among pregnant women and from
14 563 (weighted estimate, 32.1 mil-
lion )to21604 (weighted estimate, 35.7
million) among nonpregnant women.
The percentage of women who re-
ported that they were pregnant varied
little over the study period (average
weighted annual prevalence, 5%). The
sociodemographic characteristics of the
survey respondents (Table 1) are com-
parable with those of the population in
the 33 states combined.15
Trends in Smoking Initiation,
Quitting, and Current Smoking
Overall, the smoking initiation rate
among women aged 18 to 44 years de-
creased significantly, from 44.1% in
1987 to 38.2% in 1996 (FIGURE 1). The
largest decline in the smoking initia-
tion rate occurred between 1987 and
1991 (Figure 1). However, among
women aged 18 to 20 years, smoking
initiation rates changed little between
1987 (26.1%) and 1996 (27.4%). There
was no statistically significant differ-
ence in yearly smoking initiation rates
between pregnant and nonpregnant
women either in 1987 (41.7% vs 42.3%)
or 1996 (36.4% vs 37.6%).
In the total sample, the percentage
who had quit smoking changed little be-
tween 1987 and 1996 among both preg-
nant women (from 26.3% to 25.2%)
and nonpregnant women (from 16.3%
to 14.4%). Also, BRFSS data from 1992
through 1996 indicated that the per-
centage of currently smoking women
of childbearing age who had at-
tempted to quit smoking for at least 1
day in the past year actually declined
significantly, from 57.8% to 50.3%.
Over time, the percentage of current
smokers decreased significantly among
both pregnant and nonpregnant women
(Figure 1, TABLE 2). However, in each
year, pregnant women were about half
as likely as nonpregnant women to be
currentsmokers,andthevariationinthe
PRR over time was not statistically sig-
nificant(averageannualPRR,0.54)(Fig-
ure 1, Table 2). Data available from
BRFSS for 1994-1996 indicate that preg-
nant women who smoked were signifi-
cantly more likely to be daily smokers
than their nonpregnant counterparts
(88.9% vs 79.2%). Among pregnant
womenwhowerecurrentsmokers,there
was no statistically significant varia-
tion in the median number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day during the 10-
year period (average annual median
number, 10), whereas among nonpreg-
nant women, the median number of
cigarettes smoked per day decreased sig-
nificantly, from 19 in 1987 to 15 in 1996
(FIGURE 2).
Subgroup Variations
in Current Smoking
For both pregnant and nonpregnant
women, the secular decline in the per-
centage of current smokers occurred
largely among women who had smoked
1 or more packs of cigarettes per day
(Table 2). This subgroup of women also
had the largest pregnancy-related reduc-

tion in smoking each year (indicated by
the lowest PRR value of 0.3 in 1996).
Among both pregnant and nonpreg-
nant women, the percentage of cur-
rent smokers decreased between 1987
and 1996 within most sociodemo-
graphic subgroups studied, except for
the youngest women and oldest preg-
nant women, among whom it in-
creased slightly (Table 2). Among the
subgroups of women in which current
smoking rates decreased, the decrease
was not significant among pregnant
women who were married or were high
school graduates or among nonpreg-
nant women who had higher educa-
tion or were white, unmarried, or un-
employed (Table 2).
Smoking prevalence rates varied
widely in 1987 among the sociodemo-
graphic subgroups studied (range,
9.4%-34.1% for pregnant and 20.0%-
43.4% for nonpregnant), as did the
PRRs (range, 0.4-1.2) (Table 2). By
1996, the variations in the PRRs had
narrowed (range, 0.3-0.7), particu-
larly among the subgroups that had the
highest smoking prevalence rates in
1987, indicating that these subgroups
had greater pregnancy-related reduc-
tions over time (Table 2).
Factors that were independently as-
sociated with a high risk for current
smoking each calendar year were the
same for pregnant and nonpregnant
women, namely, having a high school
education or less, being white, and be-
ing unmarried (TABLE 3). Among preg-
nant women, the variation between the
odds of smoking in 1987 and the odds
of smoking in 1996 was significant only
within the 21- to 30-year-old age group,
in which it decreased (Table 3). Among
nonpregnant women, the odds of smok-
ingincreasedsignificantlybetween1987
and 1996 among white women and
women who were unmarried (Table 3).
COMMENT
This analysis of population-based sur-
vey data indicates that the decline in
rates of current smoking among preg-
nant women in the United States be-
tween 1987 and 1996 reflects a de-
cline in smoking initiation among
women of childbearing age rather than
an increase in quitting rates related to
pregnancy. Over time, pregnant women
have continued to be about half as likely
as nonpregnant women to smoke.
Among pregnant women, we found no
significant change during the 10-year
study period in the median number of
cigarettes smoked. Between 1987 and
1996, among young women, preva-
lence rates of smoking initiation and
current smoking increased slightly.
Because this survey excluded people
without telephones, those younger than
18 years, and those who did not live in
private residences, and because we used
self-reported information on preg-
nancy, these data may have underesti-
mated the actual prevalence of smok-
ing. Furthermore, because the survey
produced point-prevalence data, they
cannot be used to determine whether a

women who had quit smoking for a day
(on the day of the interview) may have
beenconsiderednonsmokersinthissur-
vey. However, point-prevalence esti-
mates of current smoking reported by
other studies for corresponding years
are generally consistent with our find-
ings.18,19 Because the data were from a
cross-sectional survey, we could not as-
sess whether the substantial decline be-
tween 1987 and 1996 in the percentage
of heavy smokers among both pregnant
and nonpregnant women was due to
heavy smokers stopping altogether,
heavy smokers reducing the number of
cigarettes they smoked, or fewer women
who started smoking reaching a heavy
level.Pregnantsmokersweremorelikely
to be daily smokers than their nonpreg-
nantcounterparts,probablybecausepro-
portionately more of the less-than-daily
smokers may have quit smoking when
they learned they were pregnant.
For US women of reproductive age,
theyear2000nationalobjectiveofa12%
prevalence rate of current smoking13 is
unlikely to be achieved given that the
1996 prevalence rate of current smok-
ing is about twice that of the year 2000
target. For pregnant women, the 1996
rateisonly2%higherthantheyear2000
objective of 10%13; however, because of
the reported recent increases in smok-
ing initiation among adolescents and
young women10-12 and no concurrent in-
crease in quitting rates by current smok-
ers shown in this analysis, the year 2000
objectiveforpregnantwomenisalsoun-
likely to be met. Furthermore, most
adult smokers in the United States be-
come regular smokers before age 18
years,10 and for such smokers quitting
is difficult; only 2.5% of the 34% who
attempt to quit smoking each year are
successfulinquittingpermanently.16 The
fact that most smokers (54%) continue
to smoke after they learn that they are
pregnant underscores the need for more
extensive efforts to reduce smoking by
women over their entire lives and to re-
duce the number of women who begin
smoking.
We found that the risk factors for
smoking are similar for pregnant and
nonpregnant women and that many
such women are likely to rely on pub-
licly funded health care providers for
care. Clinicians who provide this care
should extend the "ask, advise, assist,
and arrange" strategy suggested in the
clinical practice guidelines on smoking
cessation20,21 to each woman. Efforts to
curb smoking during pregnancy should
begininthepreconceptionperiod.Clini-
cally proven prenatal smoking cessa-
tion interventions that can be deliv-
ered in primary care settings are now
available.20-24 "Minimal contact" pri-
mary care clinic-based smoking preven-
tion interventions have been found to
be effective.24 Nicotine replacement
products can improve the effectiveness
of comprehensive behavioral interven-
tions to reduce smoking.25 For preg-
nantwomen,nicotinereplacementprod-
ucts should be recommended only if the
increased likelihood of smoking cessa-
tion outweighs the harmful effects of
nicotine and potential concomitant
smoking on the fetus.20
Pregnancy may represent a period
when smoking cessation activities are
most effective. If prenatal smoking ces-
sation is not feasible, a reduction in the
number of cigarettes smoked could ben-
efit the pregnancy, including a reduc-
tion in risk of low birth weight.8 To re-
duce postpartum relapses in smoking,
interventions should continue be-
yond the perinatal period. Of note, in
our study declines in smoking rates
were not as pronounced among mar-
ried pregnant women as they were
among their unmarried counterparts.
Because smokers may have partners
whose smoking habits match their own,
and because the presence of such a part-
ner may negatively affect a woman's at-
tempts to quit smoking,26 screening for
tobacco use should be extended to part-
ners of women who smoke. For women
who are unable to quit smoking and
who are at risk of becoming pregnant,
the feasibility of pregnancy postpone-
ment until smoking cessation is
achieved should be explored.27
Although the importance of reduc-
ing tobacco use by current smokers
is clear, the findings from our study,
including the unchanging trends in
current smoking rates among young
women, and reports from England,28
