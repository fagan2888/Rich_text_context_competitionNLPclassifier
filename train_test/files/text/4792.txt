Abstract
Objective: To analyse the relationships between dietary patterns and cognitive function in elderly
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: Patients with T2DM completed a 3-day dietary record and Mini-mental State
Examination (MMSE). Dietary patterns were identified by factor analysis.
Results: The study included 73 patients and identified five dietary patterns, one of which was
characterized by high loading for vegetables and fish. A higher consumption of vegetables and fish
was significantly associated with improved MMSE score (unadjusted model, model adjusted for age
and sex, and model adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetic nephropathy and alcohol
consumption), and decreased prevalence of suspected mild dementia (unadjusted model, model
adjusted for age and sex).
Conclusions: A high score in the vegetables and fish dietary pattern was associated with high
MMSE score and low prevalence of suspected mild dementia in elderly patients with T2DM.

Introduction
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) are between two and four times
more likely to develop cognitive impairment
and dementia than individuals without
T2DM.1 Several factors (including age, sex,
glycaemic control, disease duration, compli-
cations, hypertension, lipid metabolism,
education, depression, physical activity and
chronic infection) are known to correlate
with cognitive impairment in patients with
T2DM,2­6 and there are likely to be add-
itional unrecognized contributing factors.
Intake of certain types of foods (such as
fish and vegetables) and nutrients (such as
vitamins C, E, B6 and B12, folate, potas-
sium, calcium, magnesium and unsaturated
fatty acids) lowers the risk of cognitive
impairment7,8 and/or Alzheimer's disease,9
although the extent of protection varies
among studies. Since people do not consume
individual foods or single nutrients in real
life, the dietary pattern should be taken into
consideration as it reflects the complexity of
dietary intake, where foods have interactive,
synergistic and antagonistic effects.10 It has
been suggested that dietary pattern may be
more predictive of disease risks than specific
food- and nutrient-based approaches.10
Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary
pattern (characterized by high consumption
of plant foods [vegetables, fruits, legumes
and cereals], high intake of olive oil, mod-
erate intake of fish, low-to-moderate intake
of dairy products and low intake of satu-
rated fats and meat11) is associated with
slower cognitive decline12 and reduced
Alzheimer's disease risk.13 Although the
Japanese dietary pattern differs widely
from the Mediterranean diet, a diet char-
acterized by high intake of soybeans,
vegetables, algae, dairy products and low
intake of rice was associated with reduced
risk of dementia in the general population of
elderly Japanese individuals.14 Taken
together, these data suggest that dietary
pattern could contribute to the risk of
cognitive decline and/or Alzheimer's
disease.
Patients with T2DM have been found to
consume higher quantities of fruit, vege-
tables and meat than healthy control sub-
jects,15 but the relationship between dietary
patterns and cognitive function in patients
with T2DM remains largely unexplored.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was
to analyse these associations using data
from elderly Japanese patients with T2DM.
Patients and methods
Study population
This ancillary study was a subanalysis of an
original study that investigated the relation-
ship between olfactory function and cogni-
tive function.16 Patients with T2DM were
enrolled from the Diabetes Outpatient
Clinic of Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric
Medical Centre (Tokyo, Japan) and
Juntendo University Hospital (Tokyo,
Japan) between October 2012 and
December 2013, as described.16 Inclusion
criteria were patients with T2DM who were
aged >65 years and free of clinically evident
cognitive impairment. Exclusion criteria
were: (i) severe infection within the preced-
ing 2 weeks; (ii) any scheduled or performed
surgery; (iii) severe trauma; (iv) current
psychiatric disorders; (v) partial or complete
olfactory dysfunction associated with sinus-
itis, allergic rhinitis or deviated nasal
septum; (vi) history of brain tumour; (vii)
MMSE (mini-mental state examination)

score <22 points (moderate-to-severe cog-
nitive impairment17); (ix) patients con-
sidered ineligible based on the assessment
of clinical investigators.
The study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Juntendo
University Hospital and Juntendo Tokyo
Koto Geriatric Medical Centre, and was
conducted in accordance with the principles
described in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Each patient provided written informed
consent prior to enrolment.
MMSE
Cognitive status was evaluated using
MMSE,18,19 and was assessed in a separate
room by a trained physician. The MMSE
scale ranges between 0 and 30, with a higher
score indicating a better cognitive perform-
ance. Patients were divided into two groups:
suspected mild dementia (score 22­26), and
normal (score !27).17
Assessment of depression
Depression was assessed in a separate room by
a trained physician (H.S.) using the BDI (Beck
Depression inventory)-II.20 The BDI-II scale
ranges between 0 and 63, with higher scores
indicating increasingly severe depression.
Dietary survey
Weighed dietary records were obtained from
each patient for three consecutive days just
before a scheduled diabetes-related hospital
appointment. The participants were also
asked to take digital pictures of their
meals. A trained nutritionist (M.E.) (who
was blinded to participants' characteristics)
checked all the recorded sheets and digital
pictures, and interviewed subjects to clarify
any ambiguous points and increase the
accuracy of reporting. Mean values of the
estimated individual food amounts were
used in the analysis. Alcohol intake was
reported as the quantities of specific types of
alcoholic beverage. The consumption of
foods and nutrients was estimated by a
computerized dietary analysis program
(HealthyMaker Pro 501; Mushroom soft
Inc., Tokyo, Japan; http://www.msrsoft.
com/) For dietary pattern analysis, food
items were classified into 19 foods based on
the whole food catalogue of the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology, Japan.
Clinical parameters
Data including body mass index (BMI; kg/
m2), smoking status (nonsmokers, former
smokers [no smoking in 6 months prior to
study] or current smokers), and presence of
retinopathy (simple, preproliferative or pro-
liferative retinopathy as defined by trained
ophthalmologists), nephropathy (microal-
buminuria [30 mg/g creatinine]) and neur-
opathy (two or more of: symptoms; absence
of ankle tendon reflexes; abnormal vibration
perception threshold using a tuning fork)
were obtained by patient examination.
Blood samples were obtained after over-
night fast. Serum lipids (total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol,
triglycerides) and glucose were quantified
using routine analyser (LABOSPECT 008;
Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan),
and HbA1c (National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program; http://www.
ngsp.org/) was quantified using a high-
performance liquid chromatography
analyser (HLC-723G8; Tosho Bioscience,
Tokyo, Japan)
Statistical analyses
No formal sample size justification for this
study was performed as it was an ancillary
study of an exploratory nature. Data were
presented as meanÆ SD or median (inter-
quartile range) for continuous variables, or

n(%) of patients for categorical variables.
Some parameters were logarithmically trans-
formed to approximate normal distribution.
Factor analysis with varimax rotation was
used to reduce the complexity of dietary
patterns. Factors with cumulative coefficient
of determination >0.5 were retained. For
simplicity, individual metabolites with a
factor loading >0.4 are reported as composing
that factor. Factor scores for each dietary
pattern and each subject were calculated by
summing each dietary pattern score, weighted
by their factor loadings. Estimated factor
scores were categorized into tertiles. Trend
association across tertiles was evaluated using
linear regression analysis for continuous vari-
ables or logistic regression analysis for cat-
egorical variables, in an unadjusted model
and/or model adjusted for age and sex.
Spearman's correlation coefficient was used
to evaluate correlations between MMSE score
and possible risk factors for cognitive impair-
ment (BMI, estimated duration of diabetes,
glycaemic control, presence of diabetic com-
plications [retinopathy, nephropathy and
neuropathy], education, depressive status,
smoking, alcohol consumption, food intake,
hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). Trend
associations across MMSE score and sus-
pected mild dementia tertiles were evaluated
by linear regression analysis and logistic
regression analysis, respectively. Regression
models included statistically significant vari-
ables (P< 0.05) from the above Spearman's
correlation analysis, in addition to age and
sex. Statistical analyses were performed using
SASÕ software version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA), and two-sided P-
values< 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study included 73 patients (40 male/33
female; mean age 72.4Æ 5.1 years; age range
65­83 years). Demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.
Factor analysis with varimax rotation
identified five dietary patterns (Table 2): (i)
oils, nuts, seeds, sugars and eggs (high
loadings for fats and oils, nuts, seeds,
sugars and eggs); (ii) cereals and meats
(high loadings for cereals, meats, seasonings,

potatoes (high loadings for fruits, potatoes,
cooking and processing, algae, green and
dark-yellow vegetables, and milk and milk
products); (iv) vegetables and fish (high
loadings for green/dark yellow leafy vege-
tables, fish and seafood, and beverages); (v)
pulses (high loading for pulses). Overall,
these five patterns accounted for 56% of the
variance in food intake.
Table 3 shows the nutrient intake for each
dietary pattern. In the oils, nuts, seeds,
sugars and eggs pattern, there was a signifi-
cant trend across the tertiles for increased
intake of carbohydrate, protein, fat, zinc,
copper, cholesterol, salt, saturated fatty
acids and omega 6 fatty acids (P < 0.05 for
each comparison). Across the tertiles in the
cereals and meats pattern, there were sig-
nificant trends for increased consumption of
carbohydrate, zinc, copper, fibre and salt
(P < 0.05 for each comparison). In the fruits
and potatoes pattern, there were significant
trends towards increased intake of carbohy-
drate, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folic acid,
calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper and fibre
(P < 0.05 for each comparison). In the vege-
tables and fish pattern, there were signifi-
cantly higher intakes of protein, fat, vitamin
B6, vitamin B12, niacin, vitamin C, vitamin
E, folic acid, potassium, calcium, magne-
sium, zinc, copper, fibre, salt, monounsatu-
rated fatty acids, omega 3 fatty acids and
omega 6 fatty acids across the tertiles
(P < 0.05 for each comparison). There was
a significant trend towards increased chol-
esterol consumption in the pulses pattern
(P < 0.05).

stratified by dietary pattern score. In the
oils, nuts, seeds, sugars and eggs pattern,
there was a significant trend towards
increased calorie consumption and LDL
cholesterol level (P < 0.05 for each compari-
son). In the cereals and meats pattern, there
was a significant trend towards lower HDL
cholesterol (P < 0.05). There were significant
trends for increased calorie consumption
and lower prevalence of diabetic retinopathy
in the fruits and potatoes pattern (P < 0.05
for each comparison). Across the tertiles in
the vegetables and fish pattern, there were
significant trends towards increased calorie
and alcohol consumption, higher diastolic
blood pressure, and reduced likelihood of
antiplatelet agent use (P < 0.05 for each
comparison). There was a significant trend
towards higher diastolic and systolic blood
pressure in the pulses pattern (P < 0.05 for
each comparison).
Correlation analysis found significant
relationships between MMSE score and
education (r ¼ 0.38, P ¼ 0.001), presence of
diabetic nephropathy (r ¼ À0.29, P ¼ 0.013)
and alcohol consumption (r ¼ 0.24,
P ¼ 0.042). Data regarding cognitive func-
tion across the tertiles for each dietary
pattern are shown in Table 5. A higher
consumption of vegetables and fish was
significantly associated with improved
MMSE score (unadjusted model,
P < 0.001; model adjusted for age and sex,
P < 0.01; model adjusted for age, sex, edu-
cation, diabetic nephropathy and alcohol
consumption, P < 0.05) and decreased
prevalence of suspected mild dementia
(unadjusted model, P < 0.05; model
adjusted for age and sex, P < 0.05). There
were no other significant trends in cognitive
function in any other dietary pattern.
Discussion
The present study identified five dietary
patterns, of which a high score in the
vegetables and fish pattern was associated
with a heightened MMSE score and a

reduced risk of suspected mild dementia in
elderly patients with T2DM.
A high score in the vegetables and fish
pattern was also associated with a heigh-
tened intake of various vitamins and min-
erals, in the present study. These are known
to act as antioxidant agents, and oxidative
stress is a substantial risk factor for age-
related cognitive decline.21 The antioxidant
rich diet in the vegetables and fish pattern
may account for the high MMSE score and
low prevalence of mild dementia in these
subjects. Consistent with our findings,
others have demonstrated an association
between a high intake of vegetables and a
reduced risk of cognitive decline.22­24
In the present study, subjects with a high
score in the fruits and potatoes pattern also
consumed a diet that was high in vitamins
and minerals, but there was no association
between this dietary pattern and cognitive
function. The effect of a high intake of fruits
on the prevention of cognitive decline is
unclear.24 A significant negative association
has been identified between fructose intake
and cognitive function among middle-aged
and elderly subjects without T2DM,25 and it
is possible that high fructose intake may
attenuate the beneficial effects of vitamins
and minerals from fruits. On the other hand,
others have found that high fruit intake
correlated with low incidence of diabetic
retinopathy,26 suggesting that the antioxi-
dative effect of vitamins may prevent its
progression. This is consistent with the
present finding of a low prevalence of dia-
betic retinopathy in the highest tertile of the
fruits and potatoes pattern.
Studies have found a correlation between
high fish consumption and a reduced risk of
cognitive decline,27­29 although reports are
not consistent.30,31 Generally, fish contains
high amount of omega 3 fatty acids in
addition to vitamins and minerals. There
was a positive correlation between the vege-
tables and fish pattern and omega 3 fatty
acids in the present study, which may be
beneficial for brain health via their anti-
inflammatory, antioxidative and antithrom-
botic properties.32 The higher cognitive
function and lower use of antiplatelet
agents in subjects with a high vegetables
and fish score, compared with other subjects
in the present study, may be at least in part
due to their high intake of omega 3 fatty
acids.
Several studies have demonstrated that
light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is
associated with high cognitive test score
and/or risk reductions in the development
of dementia,33­36 although other studies do
not support such findings.37,38 While the
mechanisms underlying the relationship
between alcohol intake and cognitive func-
tion remain largely unknown, moderate
alcohol intake may play a role in cardiopro-
tection and/or neuroprotection through the
activation of cellular survival pathways,39
leading to reductions in the risk of cardio-
vascular and/or cerebrovascular dis-
eases,40,41 and, ultimately, a reduced risk of
cognitive decline. Alcohol consumption was
very modest in the present study, but
correlated with MMSE score. In addition,
patients with a high vegetables and fish score
consumed significantly more alcohol than
those in the lowest tertile. Thus, the con-
sumption of moderate amounts of alcohol
(8 g/day) in those subjects could also be
associated with better cognitive function. It
is interesting to note that the vegetables and
fish pattern was associated with high MMSE
score, even after adjustment for confound-
ing factors including alcohol intake.
The present study has several limitations.
First, the study was a subanalysis of a small
sample size study with a cross-sectional
design. Such study design may result in
selection bias and does not allow inference
of a causal relationship between dietary
patterns and cognitive function. In particu-
lar, it is possible that dietary patterns may
have changed as a result of altered cogni-
tion; also, we cannot exclude the possibility
514 Journal of International Medical Research 43(4)
that dietary patterns found in this study
were influenced by unknown factors caused
by a decline in cognitive function.
Furthermore, some of the negative results
may be related to the underpowered sample
size. Another potential limitation is that we
evaluated dietary patterns and cognitive
function via self-reported questionnaires;
this method has been widely used in studies,
however. It is also necessary to acknowledge
that the validity and reproducibility of diet-
ary patterns identified in this study have not
been confirmed, although the methods
employed have been widely used. In add-
ition, we did not include a group of control
subjects without T2DM, and it is therefore
impossible to determine whether our find-
ings are general or specific to T2DM. Other
lifestyle factors such as physical activity,
sleep/wake pattern and metal health, were
not evaluated, and we cannot exclude the
possibility that subjects with higher scores
for vegetables and fish may have had higher
health-related literacy than other subjects.
Finally, we could not fully consider possible
confounding factors associated with cogni-
tive function.
In conclusion, a high score in the vege-
tables and fish dietary pattern was asso-
ciated with high MMSE score and low
prevalence of suspected mild dementia in
elderly patients with T2DM.
