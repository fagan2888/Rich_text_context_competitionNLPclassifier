Abstract
Objective: The present study examined the associations between adult food
insecurity (FI) and percentage body fat (%BF) and BMI, stratified by height (HT).
Design, setting and subjects: %BF, HT and BMI of 2117 men and 1909 women in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2002 were analysed
in relation to adult food security status using multiple regression procedures.
Results: Compared with the fully food-secure, men's %BF, BMI and HT were lower
as FI intensified. Marginal food security among women was associated with
1?3 cm shorter HT, P 5 0?016. Marginal food security among women who were
below median HT was associated with about 2?0 kg/m2 higher BMI, P 5 0?042.
%BF was not associated with FI among women.
Conclusions: FI is associated with shorter HT and lower %BF and BMI in men.
Women's HT should be considered in the reported associations between FI and
higher BMI.

Between 1995 and 2006, the prevalence of adult food
insecurity (FI), defined as having limited or uncertain
availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or
limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in
socially acceptable ways(1), fluctuated between 9?5 and
11?9 %(2) in the USA. Several research reports indicate that
food-insecure individuals are at higher risk of overweight
and obesity (OWOB) and obesity-related health pro-
blems(3,4). Intermediate levels of FI are associated with
higher BMI in women(5­7) and in some cases men(5,8).
These associations have been observed to vary by the level
and severity of FI(9). The mechanisms responsible for the
positive association between FI and BMI in women have
not been established but several plausible explanations
have been offered, including socio-economic deprivation,
adaptive coping behaviour and lack of access to resour-
ces(7,10­12). However, these are characteristics indicative of
low socio-economic status, which is associated with shorter
height (HT)(13­15).
To our knowledge, nutritional indicators that reflect
earlier life experiences, such as HT, have not been
documented among food-insecure adults living in the
USA. Short HT arising from inadequate nutrition has been
observed in developing countries for several dec-
ades(14,16). Long-term nutritional deficiencies among vul-
nerable populations such as the food-insecure engender
HT deficits in adults(13,16). Inadequate nutrition can result
in inadequate intakes of nutrients essential for linear
growth, including iodine, Zn, Ca, vitamin A, protein and
energy, one consequence of which is HT deficits in
adults(16,17). Studies show that people who experience
undernutrition at a young age recover in weight but not
in HT(13,18,19).
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is one method
used for the assessment of percentage body fat
(%BF)(20­22). Whereas researchers have examined the
associations between FI and OWOB using BMI, to our
knowledge none have examined the associations using
%BF derived from BIA. If a positive association exists
between FI and BMI among women, a positive associa-
tion between FI and %BF in women would be expected.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the
associations between FI and %BF and BMI, and whether
these associations vary by HT.
Methods
Study sample and data sources
Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002 were used
for the present study. The NHANES is a nationally
representative survey conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention. Stratified, multistage probability
cluster sampling methods were used in the NHANES. It is
an ongoing survey that covers the non-institutionalized
US civilian population.
Because prior researchers have reported associations
between FI and OWOB in adults, those 18­50 years of
age were selected for the present analysis. In addition,
this age range was selected because body composition
and HT vary markedly in younger and older persons(23,24)
and the use of BMI to assess adiposity in older adults has
been questioned(25,26).
From the baseline sample of 4048 who had complete
BIA and food security data in the NHANES 1999­2002, a
total of 4026 (99?46%) subjects comprising 2117 men and
1909 women were included after meeting various inclusion
criteria, i.e. has complete data on age, body weight, food
security status, gender and HT, and not having extremely
low or extremely high %BF. Twenty-two subjects, com-
prising 0?54 % of the baseline sample, did not satisfy the
inclusion criteria and thus were excluded from analysis. Of
the twenty-two subjects who did not meet the inclusion
criteria, two subjects had missing data for body weight. Six
and fourteen had extremely low and high %BF respec-
tively, were clear outliers and thus were excluded from the
study. The NCHS Ethics Review Board approved the survey
protocols and informed consent was obtained from all
subjects. The procedures for the present study were
approved locally by the Institutional Review Board, Office
of Human Subjects Research, Auburn University, Alabama.
Food security measure
In the NHANES 1999­2002, depending on the number of
affirmative answers to a subset of ten items pertaining
to adults from the core eighteen-item US food security
survey module, subjects were assigned to one of four
food security levels: (i) fully food-secure; (ii) marginal
food security (affirmative answers to one or two of the
questions about food security, suggesting a risk for FI);
(iii) food-insecure without hunger (reported uncertainty
about food supply, a need to adapt food management
strategies or indicative of a decrease in diet quality); or
(iv) food-insecure with hunger (both quality and quantity
of food decreased to the extent that there was repeated
experience of the physical sensations of hunger)(2,8).
Food security questions asked during the survey referred
to food-related circumstances in the past 12 months prior
to administration of the food security questionnaire(2).
Body fat and height assessment
A bioimpedance spectrum analyser (HYDRA ECF/ICF
4200; Xitron Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was
used for BIA, which involved tetrapolar measurement
of whole-body electrical resistance. In the NHANES
1999­2002, BIA examinations were conducted by trained
health technicians in the mobile examination centres
(MEC)(27). In the present study, BIA values at 50 kHz
electrical current were used to estimate fat-free body
mass (FFM) by utilizing a prediction equation for adult
men and women which has been validated against dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry(22). Utilizing this equa-
tion(22), fat-free mass was estimated as:
FFM ¼ À 4.104 þ ð0.518 Â H2=RÞ þ ð0.231 Â weightÞ
þ ð0.130 Â reactanceÞ þ ð4.229 Â gender; males
¼ 1; females ¼ 0Þ;
where H2/R is HT squared divided by resistance (cm2/V).
From the estimated FFM, the %BF was calculated as
follows(28):
%BF ¼ ½ðbody weight À FFMÞCbody weight Â 100:
%BF values were calculated separately for men and
women. Subjects who were measured in the BIA sample in
the NHANES 1999­2002 were within the ages 18­50 years.
In the NHANES 1999­2002, HT was measured by
trained technicians using a stadiometer equipped with an
integrated survey information system(29). Further details
on HT and other anthropometric measurements are
available elsewhere(29).
Statistical analysis and covariates
To correct for MEC sampling design and to apply MEC
sampling weights(30), the STATA statistical software
package version 10?0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX,
USA) was used to estimate all descriptive and inferential
statistics. Due to reported differences in the association
between FI and body weight status between men and
women, all analyses were stratified by gender(5,10).
For categorical data, Pearson's x2 test of independence
with Rao and Scott correction was used, whereas for
continuous variables, the overall F test was used to test
for significant bivariate associations across levels of food
security(31,32).
Multiple linear regression models were used to examine
the associations between FI and %BF, BMI and HT. In
multiple linear regression models, second-order interaction
terms of FI and HT were tested (Wald F test) to determine if
HT modified the association between FI and BMI. Because
the interaction terms were significant, we stratified the FI
models for %BF and BMI by HT. We stratified subjects into
those below median HT and median HT or taller as follows
for this sample: (i) for men, below median HT was
,174?7 cm and median HT or taller was $174?7 cm; and (ii)
for women, below median HT was ,161?7 cm and median
HT or taller was $161?7 cm.
Covariates included in all multiple linear regression
models were age, education, ethnicity/race, income and
smoking status because of reported associations with
body weight(13,33,34). Age, %BF, BMI, HT and income
were examined as continuous variables whereas educa-
tion, ethnicity and smoking status were examined as
indicator variables. Level of education was classified as
less than high school degree and high school degree or

higher. Due to small sample sizes, race/ethnicity was
collapsed into three categories: Black non-Hispanic;
Mexican-American and other Hispanics; and White
non-Hispanic plus others. In the NHANES 1999­2002,
respondents who reported they currently smoked at least
100 cigarettes, a pipe twenty times and a cigar twenty
times in their lifetime were classified as current smokers.
Others who reported previous smoking were classified as
ex-smokers. Those who reported never smoking to all
were classified as never smokers.
In testing for associations between the main exposure
variable (food security status) and the outcome variables
(%BF, BMI and HT), the fully food-secure category was
the referent group and did not include the marginal food
security category. The significance of the independent
association of FI was assessed by means of a t test on the
b coefficients. In all statistical tests, significant differences
were tested at P , 0?05.
Results
Sample characteristics
Background characteristics of the subjects are presented
in Table 1. Of the 4026 subjects in the study, 52 % were
men and 48 % were women. Subjects who were fully
food-secure made up 82?01 % of this sample. The mean
BMI of the subjects was 26?76 (SE 0?10) kg/m2 for men and
27?41 (SE 0?24) kg/m2 for women. The other character-
istics of the subjects across the four levels of food security
are shown in Table 1.
Percentage body fat, BMI and height
There was significant interaction between food security
status and HT in the association between FI and BMI as
indicated by the adjusted Wald test, P , 0?038. This result
indicates that the trends in the association between FI and
BMI were different at different levels of HT.
Table 2 shows the %BF of men and women by food
security status. Men who were food-insecure without
hunger or with hunger had significantly lower %BF than
men who were fully food-secure. This pattern did not
change after HT stratification in men (Table 3). Compared
with fully food-secure women, FI was not significantly
associated with %BF among women, not even after HT
stratification (Table 3).
Men who were food-insecure without hunger or with
hunger had significantly lower BMI than men who were
fully food-secure (Table 2), irrespective of HT (Table 3).
Different patterns of association were observed among
women. Before HT stratification, there was only a mar-
ginally significant positive association between FI and
BMI (Table 2) among women. However, after HT strati-
fication, women who were marginally food-secure and
were below median HT had an approximately 2 kg/m2
higher BMI compared with their fully food-secure
counterparts, P 5 0?042 (Table 3). Compared with their
fully food-secure counterparts, no significant differences
in BMI were observed among women who were of
median HT or taller.
Men who experienced FI without and with hunger had
significantly shorter HT by about 2 cm compared with
fully food-secure men. Among women, marginal food
security was associated with approximately 1?3 cm shorter
HT, P5 0?016. Although insignificant, there was a tendency
for women in the other food-insecure categories to be
shorter than their fully food-secure counterparts.
Discussion
A significant finding in the present study is that women
who were marginally food-secure and were below
median HT had significantly higher BMI, but women
who were of median HT or taller did not. Although not
statistically significant, BMI showed a tendency towards
higher values among food-insecure women who were
below median HT. Among women, no association was
found between FI and %BF which is a more sensitive
measure of adiposity. Our results indicate that, unlike
BMI, %BF did not vary by HT among women. The
importance of HT in FI and BMI analysis was observed
earlier and included as a control variable in a study which
reported a moderate (P 5 0?06) but positive association
between FI and BMI(11). Our results suggest that HT
should be considered when examining the association
between FI and BMI.
We observed that marginal food security was asso-
ciated with shorter HT in women. In the case of men, it
was the extreme forms of FI, food-insecure without and
with hunger, which were significantly associated with
shorter HT. The observation that FI was associated with
shorter HT among men and women was not unexpected
because HT deficits result from chronic under-
nutrition(14,16), which is a possible consequence of FI. It
was difficult to glean from available data whether women
who were below median HT in the present study had
experienced FI for a longer duration than those who were
of median HT or taller. However, an earlier report indi-
cated that about two-thirds of food-insecure persons in
the USA experience FI as recurring while one-fifth
experience it as frequent or chronic(35).
Low-income individuals, who largely include those who
are food insecure, are associated with shorter HT(13,15),
probably due to difficulties in obtaining optimum nutrition
during their growing years(14,16,36). Ensuring adequate
nutrition by alleviating FI would improve adult HT and
perhaps help to ameliorate its influence on the develop-
ment and progression of obesity. Improvement in adult
HT is exigent because several disease risks have been
associated with short HT in adults. Short adult HT is
associated with risk of CHD and stroke mortality(31,37).

All-cause mortality risk was double for men who were
below 165 cm in HT compared with taller men(38). A
significant association between short HT and higher
incidence of prostate cancer has been reported(39). Pre-
vious studies have shown food-insecure individuals to
be at greater risk of developing many of these chronic
diseases(4,40,41). Our finding that FI was associated with
lower HT underscores the public health importance of
nutrition programmes that target individuals during the
critical times of growth. The positive influence on infant
length and well-being through participation in federal
food assistance programmes has been reported(42,43).
%BF and BMI showed similar trends across food security
levels in men but not in women. Physiological adaptation
in women such as leptin-mediated maintenance of critical
fat mass for reproduction may contribute to obscure
differences in %BF across food security levels(44). The
levels of FI observed in this population may not indicate
energy shortage among women(45). In addition, differences
in %BF among women might have been obscured by the
already elevated %BF of the referent group, fully food-
secure women, in the present study.
The strengths of our study lie in the fact that we
assessed two indicators of adiposity, %BF and BMI, to

study their associations with FI. Another strength is that the
study accounted for important covariates including smok-
ing status, which is common among food-insecure persons
and influences their dietary intake and composition(46,47)
and body weight(48,49). Available literature indicates that,
unlike the present study, only a few controlled for smoking
in the study of the associations between FI and BMI(50).
However, there is significant inverse association between
smoking and body weight(49). In the present study, food
security status information covered a reference period of
12 months to improve sensitivity and to provide a more
reliable assessment. Another important strength is that the
study comprised a large sample of persons in the USA and
that the conduct of the study was carefully standardized.
In the present study, we observed a significant inter-
action between food security status and HT in the asso-
ciation between FI and BMI. This observation indicates
that the trend in the association between FI and BMI was
different at different levels of HT. This observation further
underscores the fact that HT should be considered when
examining the association between FI and BMI as an
index of obesity.
A limitation of the study is that the relationships between
FI and %BF and BMI were based on cross-sectional data
which do not permit inferences related to causality(5,11).
BIA is a well-recognized method for %BF assessment(20­22).
However, assessment of %BF using BIA may not be
appropriate for individuals who have extremely low or
extremely high BMI because %BF does not increase line-
arly with increasing body weight(51,52). Even though our
sample size is large, it must be noted that the present study
is based on a subsample of the subjects in the larger
NHANES 1999­2002. Thus the finding of the study may not
be representative of the larger NHANES sample.
The present study shows that FI is associated with
lower %BF, BMI and HT in men, and marginal food
security is associated with shorter HT in women. A sig-
nificantly positive association of BMI with marginal food
security was found among women who were below the
median HT. These observations highlight the need for
more vigorous public health efforts to alleviate the effects
of FI and to improve food security in this population.
Longitudinal studies, which should include repeated
measures of FI, HT, weight and adiposity indicators across
the life cycle, are needed to further elucidate the asso-
ciations between FI and %BF, BMI and HT.
