Volunteer studies suggest that showering/bathing with chlorinated tap water contributes to daily chloroform inhalation exposure for the majority of US
adults. We used data from the 1999­2000 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and weighted multiple linear regression to
test the hypothesis that personal exposure microevents such as showering or spending time at a swimming pool would be significantly associated with
chloroform levels in 2­3 day personal air samples. The NHANES data show that eight of 10 US adults are exposed to detectable levels of chloroform.
Median (1.13 mg/m3), upper percentile (95th, 12.05 mg/m3), and cancer risk estimates were similar to those from recent US regional studies. Significant
predictors of log personal air chloroform in our model (R2 ¼ 0.34) included age, chloroform concentrations in home tap water, having no windows open
at home during the sampling period, visiting a swimming pool during the sampling period, living in a mobile home/trailer or apartment versus living in a
single family (detached) home, and being Non-Hispanic Black versus Non-Hispanic White, although the race/ethnicity estimates appear influenced by
several outlying observations. Reported showering activity was not a significant predictor of personal air chloroform, possibly due to the wording of the
NHANES shower question. The NHANES measurements likely underestimate true inhalation exposures since subjects did not wear sampling badges
while showering or swimming, and because of potential undersampling by the passive monitors. Research is needed to quantify the potential difference.

Introduction
Chloroform is a colorless, volatile liquid that is sparingly soluble
in water and moderately lipophilic (Lide, 1996). Natural
sources including sea water and soil processes account for 90%
of emissions (Keene et al., 1999) while anthropogenic sources
include releases from drinking water and wastewater treatment,
certain industrial processes, cooling towers, and swimming
pools (McCulloch, 2003). Most chloroform in the environment
partitions to air, with the global average atmospheric
concentration estimated to be 73ng/m3 (McCulloch, 2003).
In mammals, inhaled chloroform is metabolized in the
liver, kidney, and nasal mucosa to trichloromethanol, which
degrades to phosgene (US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA, 2001a)). Phosgene reacts with nucleophilic groups on
enzymes and proteins to form cytotoxic adducts (EPA,
2001a). There is no current evidence of long-term bioaccu-
mulation in humans (EPA, 2001a). Although an inhalation
reference concentration has not been published, EPA
published an oral reference dose of 0.01 milligrams per
kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg-d) based on animal
evidence of hepatotoxicity (EPA, 2007). EPA classifies
chloroform as a probable human carcinogen based on animal
studies showing that inhalation or ingestion at cytotoxic
doses produces hepatic and renal neoplasia (EPA, 2001a).
EPA has published an inhalation unit risk of 2.3 Â 10À5 per
mg/m3 and estimated air concentrations of 4 mg/m3,
4 Â 10À1 mg/m3, and 4 Â 10À2 mg/m3 at the 1 in 104, 1 in
105, and 1 in 106 cancer risk levels, respectively (EPA, 2007).
The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA)
published an inhalation unit risk of 5.3 Â 10À6 per mg/m3
(CalEPA, 2002). There is limited evidence for mutagenicity
or reproductive effects at doses below those causing systemic
toxicity (EPA, 2001a).
Chlorinated water is thought to be the primary source of
non-occupational chloroform exposure among US adults
(Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2000; Wallace, 2001). Chloroform is

formed in treated water by the reaction of chlorine with
humic acids and other organic material. Concentrations vary
by region, day, and time with reported levels ranging from
below detection to maximum values of 100­200 mg/l
(Clayton et al., 1999; Backer et al., 2000; Kerger et al.,
2000; Lynberg et al., 2001; Gordon et al., 2006). Bench-scale
experiments have shown that heating tap water gradually (as
in a hot water heater) or boiling can affect point of use levels.
Weisel and Chen (1994) recorded up to twofold increases in
tap water chloroform after heating from 25­651C for 30 min,
presumably from increased formation reactions among free
chlorine and dissolved organic constituents. Krasner and
Wright (2005) on the other hand hypothesized that
simultaneous formation and volatilization were responsible
for the 34% decrease they observed in tap water chloroform
after boiling for one minute.
Chloroform's volatility and ubiquitous presence in tap
water may help explain why it is frequently detected in
personal air (e.g., air sampled from the breathing zone of
subjects) and indoor air at concentrations 10­100-fold higher
than outdoor levels. The EPA TEAM (Total Exposure
Assessment Methodology) studies showed consistently higher
levels in personal than outdoor air in 24-h samples collected
from over 1,500 subjects in four states (Wallace, 1987).
Recently, Weisel et al. (2005) measured higher concentrations
in 48-h samples of personal air (adult median 1.04 mg/m3)
and indoor air (median 0.92 mg/m3) than colocated outdoor
samples (median 0.17 mg/m3) from 300 homes in Los
Angeles, Elizabeth, and Houston. Other US researchers
have found similar ratios of personal to indoor and outdoor
levels (Clayton et al., 1999; Payne-Sturges et al., 2004;
Sexton et al., 2004a).
While these studies illustrate the greater exposure potential
of personal and indoor air versus outdoor air, less is known
about which activities and microenvironments contribute the
largest fraction of daily inhalation intake. US adult volunteer
studies point to showering and/or bathing with chlorinated
tap water as a major contributor to daily inhalation
exposures. Gordon et al. (2006) found a 440-fold increase
in bathroom air chloroform after subjects took hot showers
in their study of household water use activities by seven
volunteers. Kerger et al. (2000) found that bathroom air
chloroform increased 3 and 1 mg/m3 during showering and
bathing respectively for each mg/l chloroform in water. Using
a mass balance approach, water use data, and exposure
factor assumptions including 1 mg/l tap water chloroform,
McKone (1987) estimated that showering contributes up to
50% of lifetime chloroform inhalation exposures for the
average US adult versus spending time in the bathroom or
remainder of the house. Additionally, recent biomarker
studies of US adults show that showering/bathing is
significantly associated with increases in breath and/or blood
chloroform, while other household water use activities such
as washing dishes or clothes are not (Weisel et al., 1999;
Backer et al., 2000; Lynberg et al., 2001; Nuckols et al.,
2005; Xu and Weisel, 2005). Swimming in chlorinated pools
is also associated with elevated biomarker concentrations
though most studies have been conducted outside the United
States (Lindstrom et al., 1997; Le
´ vesque et al., 2000;
Erdinger et al., 2004; Caro and Gallego, 2007).
We used multiple linear regression to investigate the major
predictors of chloroform in personal air in the NHANES
1999­2000 VOC (volatile organic compound) Subsample
(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC,
2007a)). The NHANES data, which include chloroform
concentrations in personal air and household tap water in
addition to socioeconomic data and information on activity
patterns, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate predictors
of inhalation exposures in a nationally representative sample.
We hypothesized that personal exposure microevents such as
showering/bathing and/or spending time at a pool would be
significantly associated with chloroform concentrations in
personal air while associations with other exposure factors
would not. We also compared personal air levels to EPA's
inhalation unit risk values to evaluate the distribution of
cancer risk at the national level and among key subgroups.
Methods
NHANES Data Collection
Detailed methods are available at the NHANES website
(CDC, 2001). Briefly, a random subsample of subjects aged
20­59 was recruited to participate in the VOC study during
the NHANES medical examination. Consenting subjects
wore passive VOC exposure badges (3Mt Organic Vapor
Monitor 3520, 3M Corporation, St Paul, MN, USA)
continuously for 46­76 h after the examination. Subjects
were instructed to wear it on the upper chest, leave it on a
bedside table or clipped to a nearby lampshade while
sleeping, and leave it in an adjacent room while showering
since humidity affects readings. Subjects were also asked to
record hours spent indoors at home, indoors at work/school,
and outdoors using an activity log, and instructed to collect a
tap water sample from a bathtub or an outside faucet in an
NHANES-provided container (CDC, 2001). When subjects
returned their samples, an NHANES interviewer adminis-
tered a brief questionnaire to collect information on VOC
exposure-related activities (CDC, 2001). Home examiners
interviewed and collected samples from subjects who could
not return to the trailer within 46­76 h; samples collected
outside this window were considered invalid.
Samples were analyzed at CDC or contract laboratories.
Badge measurements below the analytical detection limit
were replaced with the detection limit, adjusted for badge
wearing minutes, divided by O2 (CDC, 2005a). Water
measurements below detection were replaced with the
detection limit divided by O2. Although badge field

duplicates, field blanks, and positive controls were collected,
results for these quality control samples were not available in
the NHANES public release data.
In addition to tap water chloroform, we considered 30
NHANES variables potential predictors of chloroform
inhalation exposure. Of these, 17 were from the VOC
Questionnaire (CDC, 2001), eight from the Demographic
Questionnaire (CDC, 2005b), and three from the Housing
Characteristics Questionnaire (CDC, 2005c). Another, body
mass index, was recorded during the NHANES examination
(CDC, 2005d). We considered the variable indicating
whether subjects participated in morning, afternoon or
evening examination sessions (CDC, 2005d) a proxy for
the time of day subjects began wearing the badge.
We downloaded the relevant data sets from the NHANES
website (CDC, 2005a, d­f, 2007a, b) and used the NHANES
VOC Subsample weights (WTSVOC2Y) as well as the
stratum (SDMVSTRA) and cluster (SDMVPSU) variables
available in the NHANES 1999­2000 demographic data for
weighted statistical analyses. Certain NHANES data were
updated after their initial public release; all used in the
present study were updated as of June 2007.
Variable Recodes
We preserved the NHANES categorical variable groupings
but recoded them so the group with the highest weighted
frequency in the VOC subsample was the reference group.
Minor recodes included combining the ``something else'' and
``dorm'' responses to the NHANES type of home question
into one category and transforming badge wearing minutes
to hours. We treated household income (INDHHINC) as a
continuous variable using the NHANES numerical cate-
gories (1­11) instead of their corresponding income ranges.
NHANES included two additional income categories (12,
4$20,000 and 13, o$20,000) to minimize refused/don't
know responses. We recoded Category 12 responses as
missing; this affected 3.2% of subjects. There were no
Category 13 responses.
We developed a new occupation variable to identify
subjects with workplace exposure potential. NHANES
Question OCD230 asked subjects the industry they worked
in while Question OCD240 asked the type of work they
performed. We created a variable (``occupation'') with four
response categories: 0 F other; 1 F food preparation/store/
restaurant; 2 F manufacturing (paper, chemicals, food,
electrical/transport equipment); 3 F construction, and; 4 F
no industry/job recorded. We considered Categories 1­3 to
have workplace exposure potential based on information
from the 11th Report on Carcinogens (US Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS, 2005)) and industries
reporting 410,000 lb annual chloroform releases during
1999­2000 to the EPA Toxic Release Inventory Program
(EPA, 2001b, 2002). We considered other industries/jobs
(Category 0) to have limited exposure potential.
Category 1 includes subjects who reported ``retail-food
stores'' or ``retail-eating/drinking places'' in response to
Question OCD230, as well as subjects who reported ``cooks''
or ``miscellaneous food preparation/service'' to Question
OCD240. We assumed these workers would spend part of the
day in a kitchen around water use activities. If a subject said
s/he worked in food preparation but as a waitress/waiter, we
coded her/him as Category 0, assuming s/he spent less time
around water than cooks or dishwashers for example.
Category 2 includes workers in food/kindred products, paper
products/printing/publishing, chemicals/petroleum/coal pro-
ducts, or transportation equipment industries. Textile/appa-
rel/furnishings machine operators were also included in
Category 2 since one author (A. Riederer) observed extensive
water use on visits to US textile mills in the 1990s, and since
the textile response category to Question OCD230 applied to
finished products which we assumed do not require as much
water to manufacture as unfinished cloth. Category 3
includes subjects who reported working in construction
(Question OCD230) and/or in construction trades (Question
OCD240).
Exploratory Data Analysis
Of the 851 subjects selected, 669 completed the VOC
sampling protocol. Subsample weights were adjusted by
CDC for non-response, and to match projected Census 2000
counts, and sum to 150,249,991 (CDC, 2006). We calculated
weighted response frequencies and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) using PROC SURVEYFREQ in SAS 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We also conducted exploratory
analysis on the weighted and unweighted continuous
variables. Distributions of raw and log-transformed data
were visually evaluated for normality and outliers. Variables
with histograms appearing right-skewed were log-trans-
formed for the regressions. We evaluated colinearity between
continuous predictors using simple scatter plots. Last, we
calculated weighted cumulative percentiles of personal air
chloroform and 95% CIs for the percentile estimates using
the DESCRIPT procedure in SUDAAN 9.0.0 (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA).
Regression Modeling and Diagnostics
We conducted weighted regression modeling in SUDAAN
PROC REGRESS, using the NHANES fill-in values for
measurements below detection. Model building was con-
ducted by first performing univariate regressions of log-
transformed chloroform badge concentrations on each of the
31 initial predictors. We also included a quadratic term for
badge wearing time to account for potential non-linearity in
response. Predictors with p-values of 0.2 or less were retained
for the multivariable analysis. These were assigned a random
number and added one-by-one in ascending order to a
multivariable model fitted using PROC REGRESS. Pre-
dictors with Pr0.2 were retained in each subsequent step.

We fit the final model and manually removed predictors with
p40.05 until all remaining predictors had Pr0.05, our
criterion for statistical significance.
We evaluated model assumptions of normality and
homoscedasticity by examining plots of predicted values
versus residuals as well as histograms and normal probability
plots of residuals. Model fit was evaluated using the R2
statistic. Following Korn and Graubard (1998), we exam-
ined partial regression plots to identify potentially influential
observations then compared parameter estimates in the full
model versus a model with each influential observation
excluded. Influential observations were excluded one at a
time in these analyses.
Cancer Risk Estimates
We estimated lifetime excess cancer risk for individual
subjects by multiplying her/his badge concentration by
EPA's chloroform inhalation unit risk (EPA, 2005). This
method estimates an individual's upper-bound risk of
developing cancer over a lifetime (70 years) of exposure at
the measured concentration. We estimated population risk in
units of excess cancer cases by multiplying each subject's
individual excess risk by her/his NHANES sample weight,
then summing across the total population or subgroup. To
evaluate the distribution of risk burden within subgroups, we
calculated the weighted percent of each subgroup at the Z1
in 104, 1 in 106­1 in 105, and r1 in 106 individual risk levels.
We considered subgroups with higher proportions of people
at the Z1 in 104 risk level to bear a greater cancer burden
than subgroups with fewer at that level. For comparison, we
repeated these calculations using the CalEPA inhalation unit
risk (CalEPA, 2002).
Results
Weighted Detection and Response Frequencies
Chloroform was measured at levels at or above detection
limits in 77.2% of badge and 80.1% of water samples.
Measurements were below detection in 20.0% of badge and
15.3% of water samples, while 2.8 and 4.6% of badge and
water samples respectively were missing. One water measure-
ment exceeded the upper bound of the calibrated range of the
analytical method but by o20% thus we included it in our
regressions; excluding it did not change statistical outcomes.
Table 1 shows weighted response frequencies and descrip-
tive statistics for the regression predictors. Missing responses
ranged from 0­4.2% while refusals or ``don't know'' (not
shown) accounted for o1% of responses. Household income
(not shown) was missing for 8.4% of subjects, while the three
most commonly reported categories were $25,000­34,999
(11.7%), $55,000­64,999 (10.4%), and Z$75,000 (22.7%).
Most subjects (48.8%) participated in the morning
NHANES examination. A majority reported wearing the
badge at all times (88.2%) and taking a hot shower for
Z5 min (85.9%). Half (55.4%) reported having windows
open at home, and/or breathing fumes from/using air
fresheners/room deodorizers (47.4%) and/or disinfectant/
degreasing cleaners (39.5%). Less than a third responded yes
to other chloroform-related items on the VOC Question-
naire. Only 8.8% reported visiting a pool. The median badge
wearing hours was 53.6 and no subject wore her/his badge
o28 h. Median hours spent indoors at home, indoors at
work/school, and outdoors were 29.9, 7.8 and 5.7,
respectively. Median chloroform in water was 13.7 ng/ml
(7.0­19.3 ng/ml, 95% CI) while the 95th percentile was
74.7 ng/ml (50.6­112.9 ng/ml, 95% CI).
Distribution of Personal Air Chloroform
Figure 1 shows the weighted cumulative distribution of
personal air chloroform in NHANES 1999­2000. Median
and 95th percentile levels were 1.13 mg/m3 (0.93­1.39 mg/m3,
95% CI) and 12.05 mg/m3 (8.12­13.54 mg/m3, 95% CI),
respectively. The maximum concentration was 53.9 mg/m3.
Figure 1 also shows the detection limits and the EPA-
estimated air concentrations at the 1 in 105 and 1 in 104
cancer risk levels. Detection limits varied for each badge
depending on wearing duration, with those worn longer
having lower limits than those worn for shorter periods. All
measurements at or below the 1 in 105 risk level (0.4 mg/m3),
corresponding to 13% of US adults, were below detection.
All measurements at or above 0.55 mg/m3 were in the
detectable range. Approximately 59% (6% of US adults)
of values in the 0.41­0.55 mg/m3 range were below detection
while 41% (4% of US adults) of values in this range were
detectable. The majority (62%) of US adults had measure-
ments at the 1 in 105­1 in 104 risk level while 19% had values
exceeding the 1 in 104 risk level.
Significant Predictors of Personal Air Chloroform
Predictors eliminated by the univariate screen included: wore
badge at all times, education, body mass index, new carpets,
hours indoors at work/school, hours outdoors, took hot
shower for Z5 min, in dry cleaning shop/drycleaned clothes,
near wood-burning, breathed fumes from/used dry cleaning
fluid/spot remover, and breathed fumes from/used glues/
adhesives hobbies/crafts. Predictors eliminated during multi-
variable modeling included: badge wearing hours, examina-
tion session, gender, occupation, income, wear respirator at
work, wear gloves at work, number of rooms in the home,
hours indoors at home, use home water treatment devices,
store paints/fuels inside home, and breathe fumes from/use
paint, disinfectant/degreasing cleaners, and air fresheners/
room deodorizers.
Diagnostic plots suggested that model assumptions of
normality and homoscedasticity were valid. A maximum of
13 parameters were estimable in the final fitted model. Table 2

(b ¼ 0.413, P ¼ 0.0007) and visiting a swimming pool

Distribution of Excess Cancer Risk
The weighted median individual excess cancer risk calculated
using the EPA inhalation unit risk value was 2.6 Â 10À5.
(2.1 Â 10À5­3.2 Â 10À5, 95% CI), whereas the 90th percen-
tile was 1.3 Â 10À4 (1.0 Â 10À4­1.9 Â 10À4, 95% CI). Using
the CalEPA value, the median was 6.0 Â 10À6 (5.0 Â 10À6­
7.4 Â 10À6, 95% CI) and the 90th percentile was 3.0 Â 10À5
(2.3 Â 10À5­4.4 Â 10À5, 95% CI). Table 3 summarizes the
excess cancer risk across key subgroups. On a total
population level, chloroform inhalation was estimated to
account for 9,197 cancer cases (or 2,119 cases using the
CalEPA value). US adults with detectable tap water chloro-
form accounted for 8,453 excess cases versus 477 cases
among those without detectable tap water levels. Having
windows closed at home during sampling was associated with
an additional 1,235 cases versus having windows open.
Although visiting a pool was a significant predictor in the
regressions, non-swimmers accounted for the larger burden
of cancer risk, with over 7,700 estimated cases. People living
in single family, detached homes and apartments accounted
for the majority of excess cases by home type (3,947 and
3,539 cases, respectively) while Non-Hispanic Whites
accounted for the greatest number of cases (45,000) among
race/ethnic groups.
Table 3 also shows the weighted relative fraction of each
subgroup falling in risk ranges of Z1 in 104 and 1 in 106­1 in
104. All individual risk estimates exceeded 1 in 106 regardless
of whether EPA or CalEPA inhalation unit risks were used.
Using the EPA value, 15.5% of the US adult population
exceeded the 1 in 104 risk level while 81.6% fell in the 106­
104 range. Using the CalEPA value, the fractions were
shifted to 1.3% and 95.8%, respectively.
The subgroup with detectable home tap water chloroform
had a higher fraction of people at the Z1 in 104 risk level
than the subgroup without detectable levels F 18.4% versus
3.4% respectively using the EPA inhalation unit risk, and
1.7% versus 0% using the CalEPA inhalation unit risk.
Other subgroups with high (i.e., 420%) relative fractions at
the Z1 in 104 risk level included the closed windows
subgroup (22.6%), swimmers (20.6%), apartment dwellers
(29.7%), dorm/something else dwellers (23.1%), Other
Hispanics (32.6%), and Non-Hispanic Blacks (24.5%).
With the CalEPA value, these estimates dropped to 3.0%
(closed windows), 7.5% (swimmers), 2.9% (apartment
dwellers), 0% (dorm/something else dwellers), 4.1% (Other
Hispanics), and 3.5% (Non-Hispanic Blacks).
Discussion
The NHANES 1999­2000 data show that eight of 10 US
adults are exposed to chloroform in personal air at levels
detectable using current analytical methods. Levels were of
similar magnitude as those reported in other studies of US
adults. Using passive sampling badges (Pellizzari et al., 2001)
similar to those used in NHANES, the Clayton et al. (1999)
EPA Region 5 study detected chloroform in 68.3% of 6-day
personal air samples, with median and 90th percentile levels
of 1.96 and 4.54 mg/m3, respectively. The higher detection
limit in this study versus NHANES may help explain the
lower detection frequency. Other recent studies have similar
detection limits and sampling durations as NHANES. Weisel
et al. (2005) detected chloroform in 84.6, 75.6, and 93.0% of
48-h personal air samples from Los Angeles, Elizabeth, and
Houston adults, respectively, using passive sampling badges.
The Houston median fell within the 95% CI of the
NHANES median, while the Los Angeles and Elizabeth

medians were slightly lower. Also using passive badges,
Sexton et al. (2004a) detected chloroform in 79.2% of 48-h
personal air samples from 71 urban Minnesota adults at a
median level similar to NHANES, though the 90th percentile
was significantly lower than its NHANES counterpart.
Significant Predictors of Personal Air Chloroform
Key demographic (age, race/ethnicity) and housing charac-
teristics (type of home, chloroform concentration in home
tap water), and personal exposure microevents (leaving
home windows open, visiting a pool) explained 34% of the
variance in log personal air chloroform in our model. Other
population-based studies report similar associations between
water concentrations and personal or indoor air levels
(Clayton et al., 1999, Weisel et al., 1999) while volunteer
studies report large short term spikes in personal or indoor
air chloroform during showering/bathing and other specific
household water use activities (Kerger et al., 2000; Gordon
et al., 2006). Reported showering activity was not signifi-
cantly associated with personal air chloroform in our model.
We believe this may be an artifact of the NHANES shower
question, not an indicator of a true lack of association. The
question asked, ``ydid you take a hot shower for five
minutes or longer during this time?'' (CDC, 2001). Because
most (85.9%) subjects answered yes, there may not have
been sufficient variance to detect an association in the
univariate regression. We did find a significant association
between spending time at a swimming pool and personal air
chloroform even though a small fraction of NHANES
subjects reported visiting a pool. This corroborates recent
non-US studies showing elevated indoor air chloroform
(range 13­647 mg/m3) at swimming pools (Le
´ vesque et al.,
2000; Fantuzzi et al., 2001; Erdinger et al., 2004). Chloro-
form was measured at 145 mg/m3 in swimming pool air in one
US study (Lindstrom et al., 1997) but we could not find more
recent estimates in the US literature.
We found a significant association between living in an
apartment or mobile home/trailer and elevated personal air
chloroform. Keeping home windows closed was also
associated with elevated levels, illustrating the influence of
air exchange rates. Although we were not able to test the
interaction between home type and window status due to
sample size limitations, we believe the home type association
may be due to differences in air exchange rates (AER) and
home volumes. Sax et al. (2004) found that AER differences
explained seasonal variation in the indoor/outdoor air
chloroform ratio in homes of New York City (n ¼ 46) and
Los Angeles (n ¼ 40) teenagers; New York apartments
sampled in winter with low AERs had the highest indoor/
outdoor ratio. Weisel et al. (2005) found higher indoor air
chloroform in apartments than single family homes in
Elizabeth and Los Angeles while in Houston they found
higher mean but lower median levels in mobile homes versus
single family homes. Mobile homes in Houston and Los
Angeles had higher median AERs than other home types,
while single-family homes had higher rates in Los Angeles.
We are unable to explain the association between race/
ethnicity and personal air chloroform in our analyses, which
appear influenced by several observations. The NHANES
analytic guidelines caution that the 1999­2000 survey
represents Mexican-Americans but not Other Hispanics,
thus findings for this group should be interpreted cautiously
(CDC, 2002). NHANES 1999­2000 did have a similar
proportion of Non-Hispanic Blacks (11.7%) as the 2000
Census (``Black or African American'', 11.4%) (Census
Bureau, 2000). We only found one other study that tested the
race/ethnicity-chloroform association. The EPA Region 5
study reported lower indoor air levels among Non-Hispanic
Whites than other race/ethnicities though the difference was
not statistically significant (i.e., P40.05) (Pellizzari et al.,
1999). It is difficult to explain why Non-Hispanic Blacks
would have higher chloroform exposures than Non-Hispanic
Whites. This may be related to home type though we were
not able to test the interaction of home type and race/
ethnicity because of small cell sizes. Nonetheless, a crude
analysis of the weighted NHANES data showed that 38.6%
(22.1­55.1%, 95% CI) of all Non-Hispanic Blacks lived in
apartments versus 15.3% (10.5­20.0%, 95% CI) of all Non-
Hispanic Whites.
Distribution of Cancer Risk Burden from Chloroform
Inhalation
All NHANES subjects had individual excess cancer risks
exceeding 1 in 106, a level considered by EPA to trigger an
evaluation of whether additional exposure reductions are
needed (EPA, 1999). Risk estimates for values below
detection were constructed using the CDC fill-in values.
Risk estimates for these levels all exceeded 1 in 106. It is
important to note that these are upper-bound risk estimates
(EPA, 2005) and that lower-bound estimates could include
zero if chloroform does not prove to be a human carcinogen.
Other US studies show similar population risk estimates.
Loh et al. (2007) estimated median and 90th percentile levels
similar to NHANES using the CalEPA inhalation unit risk
value, personal air data published since 1995, and a
simulated population of office workers and non-employed
adults aged 18­65 designed to match 2000 Census counts.
Using the EPA inhalation unit risk, Sax et al. (2006)
estimated a median of 61 excess cancer cases per million using
48-h personal air data from New York City teenagers and 8.2
per million using data from Los Angeles teenagers. The New
York estimate was identical to our NHANES-based estimate
of excess risk in the US adult population. Payne-Sturges
et al. (2004) used the EPA inhalation unit risk and 72-h
personal air data to estimate 53.3 per million excess cases for
South Baltimore adults. Wallace (1991) used the EPA value,
the TEAM outdoor air data, and modeled personal
inhalation exposures from showering to estimate an excess

risk of 7 Â 10À5 from outdoor air and 5 Â 10À5 from
showering, levels similar to the NHANES median.
Strengths and Limitations
The strength of this study is the large size and nationally-
representative nature of the NHANES VOC data. We faced
sample size limitations nonetheless. To obtain stable P-values
in weighted regression, the maximum number of estimable
parameters is limited to the denominator degrees of freedom
of the variance estimator (i.e., the number of primary
sampling clusters minus the number of sampling strata)
(Research Triangle Institute, 2001). NHANES 1999­2000
included 27 clusters and 13 strata, thus our regressions were
limited to 14 estimable parameters and we were not able to
test interactions between main effects. The combined
NHANES 1990­2000 and 2001­2002 data has 57 clusters
and 28 strata. Including the 2001­2002 VOC data when
available would strengthen our analysis by increasing the
number of estimable parameters, allowing testing of some
interactions. It would also potentially reduce the influence of
individual observations in the home type and race/ethnicity
subgroups.
In addition, the NHANES 1999­2000 investigation chose
to use the OVM 3500 series of passive samplers to measure
exposure to VOCs in general and chloroform in particular.
Passive samplers for VOCs have been used extensively in
both occupational and community-based settings for the last
two decades. Work by Chung et al. (1999), comparing
passive samplers to canister whole-air samplers suggests
negative bias for the passive samplers, but further states that
differences are likely less than 25%. More recently, Pratt
et al. (2005) have conducted a comparison of passive
samplers similar to those used in NHANES and canister
whole-air samplers for VOCs and support the small bias
conclusion of Chung et al. (1999). Both of these studies
involved laboratory and field components, but not personal
monitoring. For personal monitoring, concern has been
raised that passive samplers, which rely on passive diffusion
and assume an unobstructed pathway to the sample, may be
adversely affected. Passive samplers of this type are subject to
stagnation effects, resulting from insufficient air movement
near the badge and subsequent undersampling of bulk air, as
well as other mechanisms such as blockage by clothing,
which may result in a low bias to the inferred exposure to
VOCs. Further, effects of temperature and relative humidity
can also decrease the reliability of such samplers for personal
monitoring. However, Sexton et al. (2004a, b) have done
extensive monitoring using the OVM 3500 series badge to
measure personal exposures and have noted that personal
exposure, as measured by a badge worn by the individual,
normally exceeds concentrations measured at stationary
locations either indoors or outdoors. While none of these
studies focused specifically on chloroform, the results are
likely applicable to this compound.
Another potential limitation lies in compliance with the
badge wearing protocol. A weighted total of 4.2% of subjects
did not answer the NHANES question on how long they
wore the sampling badge, while 7.6% said they did not wear
the badge the whole time. Thus for these subjects the badge
measurements may not represent the true exposures across
the entire sampling period. However, because the weighted
median badge concentrations for these two groups (1.34 and
1.03 mg/m3, respectively) both fall within the 95% confidence
limits of the median for subjects who reported wearing the
badge the whole time (0.88­1.54 mg/m3), we expect the
difference to be small.
A third limitation lies in the NHANES sampling protocol.
Subjects were instructed not to keep badges in the bathroom
while showering/bathing. Explicit instructions were not given
for swimmers. Although this was the only practical option
using current technology, and other studies have used
identical protocols (e.g., Weisel et al., 2005), this likely
resulted in measurements that underestimated personal air
chloroform for subjects who showered/bathed or swam
during the sampling period. Volunteer studies from (Kerger
et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2006) and others have shown
significant increases in bathroom air chloroform during
showering/bathing. In their study of indoor air at five Italian
pools, Fantuzzi et al. (2001) found total trihalomethanes
levels collected poolside that were two times those measured
at other pool areas. Erdinger et al. (2004) found higher levels
in samples collected 30 versus 150 cm above the water at a
German pool. Thus although a badge placed in an adjacent
room during a shower/bath, or near a pool during
swimming, is likely to capture a fraction of the increased
air chloroform resulting from those events, it is not likely to
capture the total inhalation exposure of the showerer/bather
or swimmer.
Simple calculations based on the Gordon et al. (2006)
findings may help illustrate the potential magnitude of the
difference. In their small (n ¼ 7) volunteer study of indoor air
chloroform during scripted household water-use activities,
these researchers found a mean concentration of 2.3 mg/m3
(per mg/l in water) in bathroom air versus a median of 2.0 mg/
m3 (per mg/l) in air of an adjacent room during a 10-min hot
shower. At the NHANES 1999­2000 tap water chloroform
median (13.7 mg/l), this translates to a difference of 0.7 mg/
m3-h that might not be captured by the sampling badge if it
were kept in an adjacent room instead of the bathroom
during the showering event. This 0.7 mg/m3-h is approxi-
mately 1% of 61 mg/m3-h, or the median NHANES badge
concentration (1.13 mg/m3) times the median badge-wearing
hours (53.6). Repeating this calculation using the 95th
percentile NHANES tap water concentration (74.7 mg/l)
produces an estimate of 3.7 mg/m3-h, or 6% of the
NHANES badge median expressed in mg/m3-h. Thus, a
rough estimate of the amount of chloroform potentially
undersampled in NHANES 1999­2000 might be 1­6% for

subjects taking one 10-min shower and 2­12% for subjects
taking two 10-min showers, depending on tap water levels
and sampling duration. Future research to quantify
the difference would help produce more accurate estimates
of inhalation exposures to chloroform in the general
population.
