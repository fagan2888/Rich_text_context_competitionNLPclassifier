Adults: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Add
Health Dataset
Gretchen E. Tietjen, MD; Monita Karmakar, MS; Aliaksandr A. Amialchuk, PhD
Objectives.--To define and examine the relationship between self-reported childhood abuse and migraine among young adults.
Background.--Headache and migraine have been linked to childhood abuse in numerous studies, but there is incom-
plete characterization of headache types, and limited assessment of abuse types and frequency. Only one population-based
study has examined the relationship between emotional abuse and migraine. None have investigated the temporal relation-
ship between onset of abuse and of migraine.
Methods.--We analyzed data from 14,356 adults aged 24­32 years in Wave 4, which is a cross-sectional subset of the
longitudinal Add Health study. Participants were queried regarding abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) during child-
hood, diagnosis of migraine, depression and anxiety by healthcare providers, and symptoms of current depression. We used
logistic regression to estimate the association between childhood abuse and migraine, controlling for socio-demographic
factors, current depression, and lifetime diagnosis of anxiety and depression.
Results.--About 14% (n 5 2040) of respondents reported migraine. Participants with migraine (vs no migraine)
reported significantly higher rates of childhood abuse overall (60.6% vs 48.9%), including emotional (57.8% vs 45.4%), sex-
ual (8.4% vs 4.6%) and physical (22.4% vs 17.9%) abuse. Emotional abuse had a stronger association with migraine (odds
ratio [OR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43­1.85) when compared with physical (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.89­1.68) and
sexual abuse (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93­1.68), adjusting for socio-demographic factors. The emotional abuse-migraine associa-
tion remained even when controlling for lifetime diagnosis of depression and anxiety (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.19­1.57) and for
current depression (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.30­1.67). The odds of migraine increased with increasing number of abuse types
reported. There was a U-shaped distribution of odds of migraine associated with frequency of occurrences of emotional
abuse, peaking at one time (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.34­2.03) and  six times (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.49­2.10).
Conclusions.--Emotional abuse during childhood contributed more than physical or sexual abuse to the development of
migraine. There is a dose­response relationship with increasing number of abuse types associated with rising odds of migraine.
In addition, the relationship between the frequency of emotional abuse and the odds of migraine follows a U-shape pattern.

INTRODUCTION
Child abuse is a significant public health prob-
lem,1 with influence that extends into adulthood.
With only a fraction of cases likely reported,2,3 mal-
treatment is confirmed in one out of every eight
children,4 yet recalled by about 40% of adults.5
Headache, and in some cases migraine, has been
linked to childhood abuse in numerous studies,5-16
but even in large, non-clinic-based samples,5-7 there
are substantial limitations, including incomplete
characterization of headache types, suboptimal con-
trol groups, restricted assessment of abuse types
and frequency of occurrence, and lack of data on
the temporal sequence of the abuse-migraine rela-
tionship. Another limitation is the potential for
recall bias with retrospective querying about child-
hood experiences in adults samples with mean ages
ranging from 47 to 56 years5-7 (see Supporting
Information Table S1).
In the HMO-based Adverse Childhood Experi-
ences (ACE) study6 emotional abuse was more
tightly linked with frequent headache, not specifi-
cally migraine, than either physical or sexual
abuse.6 The influence of other abuse types and of
depression and anxiety on the emotional abuse-
migraine relationship was not explored. The Ameri-
can Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP)
study,5 using criteria from the International Classifi-
cation of Headache Disorders-217 to characterize
headache and modules from the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire18 to classify abuse, found a relation-
ship of emotional abuse and migraine, which was
independent of depression and anxiety. This was
not the case for sexual abuse; physical abuse was
not investigated. Although the sample was from a
nationally representative population it only
included persons with migraine (85%) and tension-
type headache, which served as the control group.
The population-based Canadian Community Health
Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH), controlling for
other abuse types, depression and anxiety, demon-
strated an independent association of physical
abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing abuse with self-
reported provider-diagnosed (SRPD) migraine in
both men and in women. The survey did not
include questions on emotional abuse.7 None of
these three studies examined differences in the
migraine-abuse relationship stratified by race. The
number of abuse types positively influenced the
odds of migraine diagnosis in the AMPP and
CCHS-MH, and of frequent headache in the ACE
study, but the relationship of migraine and abuse
occurrence frequency, another component of severi-
ty, has not been examined.5­7 A remaining knowl-
edge gap is of the chronology of onset of abuse and
of migraine, vital information as we develop
hypotheses of mechanistic links.
Our objective was to examine data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health),19 a nationally representative
U.S. sample of young adults to test whether emotion-
al, sexual and physical abuse are associated with
migraine, with and without accounting for other types
of abuse and for comorbidities of depression and anx-
iety. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of
frequency of abuse occurrences, and number of abuse
types. Lastly we looked at the temporal relationship
of age of onset of abuse and of migraine.
METHODS
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal prospective
study of a nationally representative sample of
American adolescents in 132 schools.19 Add Health
utilized a multistage clustered sample design for
data collection. The first survey was administered in
schools to a cross-section of approximately 90,000
adolescents in grades 7­12 during the academic
year of 1994­1995. A subset of the initial sample
(20,745 respondents) was interviewed at home in
May-December of 1995 (Wave 1) and thereafter
surveyed an additional three times. Wave 4 was an

46 January 2017
in-home survey collected from 15,701 respondents,
ages 24­35 years old, between 2007 and 2008. We
used survey data from Wave 4, following approval
by the University of Toledo institutional review
board.
Analysis Sample.--We restricted the initial sample
of 15,701 respondents by excluding those with miss-
ing sample weights, bringing the sample to 14,800.
Furthermore, we excluded respondents with missing
responses to questions about socio-demographic
characteristics, childhood abuse, and diagnosis of
migraine, current depression and lifetime diagnosis
of depression and anxiety. The final sample was
comprised of 14,365 adults from Wave 4. See Sup-
porting Information Figure S1 for additional details.
Variables and Measurement.--Dependent Varia-
ble.--We used self-reported clinically diagnosed
migraine (based on an affirmative response to the
question, "Has a doctor, nurse or other health care
provider ever told you that you have or had
migraine headaches?") as the dependent variable.
The participants were also asked for their age when
the diagnosis was made (age of migraine diagnosis).
Childhood Maltreatment.--For the purposes of this
study childhood maltreatment is defined as any abuse
experienced by the respondents before the age of
18 years. Childhood maltreatment was self-reported
by respondents using a six-item "Mistreatment by
adults" questionnaire. Emotional abuse was assessed
by the question: "Before your 18th birthday, how
often did a parent or other adult caregiver say things
that really hurt your feelings or made you feel like
you were not wanted or loved?" Physical abuse was
assessed by the question: "Before your 18th birthday,
how often did a parent or adult caregiver hit you
with a fist, kick you, or throw you down on the floor,
into a wall, or down stairs?" Sexual abuse was
assessed by the question: "How often did a parent or
other adult caregiver touch you in a sexual way, force
you to touch him or her in a sexual way, or force
you to have sexual relations?" The response options
for each question were "this never happened," "1
time," "2 times," "3­5 times," "6­10 times," and
"more than 10 times." Simple descriptive for the fre-
quency of abuse for each type showed that there was
a substantial drop in the number of responses in the
category "6­10 times" for each abuse types. Hence,
to simplify analysis and to avoid picking up outliers
in that group the categories "6­10 times" and "more
than 10 times" were merged to a single category for
each type of abuse. Those affirming abuse were asked
to estimate the age of onset (1­18 yo) of abuse for
each type. If an individual reported at least one count
of physical abuse, emotional abuse or sexual abuse,
we classified them as abused. The frequency of occur-
rence for each of the abuse types, and the number of
types of abuse an individual experienced, were also
used as independent variables.
The items used for measuring childhood abuse
were developed based on previously validated
scales by the administrators of the database. The
item measuring childhood emotional abuse was
developed by the Add Health database administra-
tors based on similar questions form the Childhood
Trauma Questionnaire.18 The item measuring child-
hood physical abuse was adapted from the validat-
ed Traumatic Events Scale20 while the item
measuring childhood sexual abuse was adapted
from the Parent-Child Version of the Conflict Tac-
tics Scale.21 All three scales have been psychometri-
cally validated and are widely used in the field of
childhood abuse research.18,20,21 Convergent validity
of the physical abuse and the sexual abuse items
from the Wave 3 of the Add Health (same items as
the ones used in Wave 4) has been discussed in pre-
vious published literature.22 This was done by cor-
relating the items as a part of a unidimensional
abuse scale to predict experiences related to child-
hood abuse (i.e., being paid to have sex, running
away from home, and being homeless).22 The
resulting models showed good fit indices with weak
to moderate association with the variables relating
to childhood abuse.22 In addition to this, the child-
hood abuse items from Waves 3 and 4 dataset have
been extensively used in published literature to pre-
dict risky behaviors later in adulthood such as inti-
mate partner violence, dating violence, substance
abuse, drinking, delinquency, risky sexual behaviors
and others.23­28 The items have also been linked
with obesity and diabetes in adulthood.29,30
The criterion validity of the three items from
Wave 4 were established in a peer reviewed
Headache 47
conference paper by researchers from University of
Pennsylvania by correlating the different abuse
types to experiences typically related to maltreat-
ment.31 However, the authors established an arbi-
trary cut point of being emotionally abused (10
times) to reflect the national prevalence of abuse.23
Hence, for the purpose of our study, we additional-
ly investigated the criterion validity of the item
measuring emotional abuse without any arbitrary
cut point, which is presented in Supporting Infor-
mation Table S2. The results revealed that the
items significantly predicted homelessness for more
than a week, running away from home, their child-
hood home being investigated by Social Service,
and being removed from childhood home by Social
Service, even after controlling for current depres-
sion and age. Furthermore, we also analyzed the
factorial structure of the three items using confir-
matory factor analysis. The analysis revealed that
the three items used for measuring childhood mal-
treatment loaded significantly (P < .05) on a single
factor solution with factor loadings above 0.5 (Sup-
porting Information Fig. S2), which suggests that
the items are unidimensional, measuring similar
traits among the respondents.
Current Depression.--Depressive symptoms in the
past seven days using a short five-item CES-D
(Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression)
scale was used to measure current depression. Since
depressive symptoms displayed at the time of sur-
vey administration may color the reporting of child-
hood abuse and other self-reported measures,
current depression was used in regression models as
a confounder.
Lifetime Diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety.---
Self-reported clinical diagnoses of depression and
anxiety were used as additional confounders.
Respondents were also asked for their age when
they were diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
The two specific items used were
 "Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provider
ever told you that you have or had depression?"
 "Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provid-
er ever told you that you have or had anxiety or
panic disorder?
Socio-Demographic Characteristics.--We used
age, sex, household income (>$30,000), health
insurance status (had insurance vs no insurance),
race (white/Caucasian vs black/African American
vs Asian vs others), and ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-
Hispanic) as socio-demographic characteristics to
account for confounding in regression models.
Statistical Analysis.--Analyses were performed
using survey estimation procedure in STATA ver-
sion 14 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA). Fre-
quencies and percentages were used to describe
socio-demographic characteristics, and prevalence
of diagnosis of migraine, depression, anxiety and
childhood maltreatment. T-test and chi-square were
used to test the difference between the groups. The
primary dichotomous variable of migraine vs no
migraine diagnosis was modeled using logistic
regression to estimate the effect of childhood mal-
treatment, while controlling for socio-demographic
factors. Current depression, and lifetime diagnosis
of depression and anxiety were added as confound-
ers in subsequent models. Subgroup analyses were
conducted by race and sex to test homogeneity of
the association between migraine and childhood
abuse. We also used linear regression to analyze
association between childhood abuse and age of
migraine diagnosis, and logistic regression to ana-
lyze the association between age of onset of abuse
and migraine diagnosis. All estimates were weight-
ed using Wave 4 cross-sectional sampling weights.
Significance level (a level) was set at 5% for all sta-
tistical significance testing.
RESULTS
The respondents in the final sample
(n 5 14,365) had a mean age of 29.5 years (range
25­35 years). About 53% (n 5 7665) of respondents
were women and 60% were Caucasians (n 5 8645).
Detailed socio-demographic characteristics, includ-
ing income, are described in Table 1.
About 14% (n 5 2040) of the sample reported
having a migraine diagnosis, of which 73% were
women. Women had 2.5 times higher odds of
reporting migraine than men (odds ratio [OR] 2.54;
95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25­2.86). About
15% of the entire sample reported being diagnosed
48 January 2017
with depression and 12% with anxiety, whereas in
the migraine sample 35% reported depression and
25% anxiety. Those with depression and anxiety
had higher odds of reporting a migraine diagnosis
(Table 1).
About 51% of the sample reported some form
of childhood abuse (Table 1). Emotional abuse was
reported by 47%, physical abuse by 19%, and
sexual abuse by 5%. An estimated 61% of persons
with migraine reported being abused compared
with 49% of respondents without migraine. Reports
of each type of abuse were also consistently higher
in those with migraine (Table 1). A detailed break-
down of the abuse types by race and sex is reported
in Supporting Information Table S3. Supporting

abuse subgroups.
Association of Childhood Abuse and
Migraine.--Bivariate logistic regressions revealed
that those who reported childhood abuse had 1.7
times higher odds of being diagnosed with migraine
(Table 1). After adjusting for socio-demographic
factors (race, ethnicity, sex, age, insurance status
and income), those who reported "any abuse" in
childhood had about 1.6 times greater odds (OR
1.59; 95% CI 1.39­1.83) of reporting a migraine
diagnosis when compared with those without a his-
tory of childhood abuse (Table 2). The odds of
migraine diagnosis were statistically higher for
those who reported multiple forms of childhood
abuse. Those reporting all three forms of childhood
abuse had almost two times higher odds (OR 1.98;
95% CI 1.31­3.01) of being diagnosed with
migraine compared with those who reported no
abuse (Table 2).
Each type of childhood abuse (i.e., emotional,
physical and sexual abuse) by itself was associated
with significantly higher odds of migraine diagnosis;
with emotional abuse (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.43­1.85)
presenting the highest odds (Table 2) when adjust-
ed for socio-demographic characteristics. However,
when all three types of childhood abuse were used
in the logistic regression model, essentially adjust-
ing for each other, only emotional abuse (OR 1.57;
95% CI 1.38­1.79) retained statistical significance
(Table 2). The association between frequency of
emotional abuse and migraine diagnosis was stron-
gest for those reporting emotional abuse occurring
either one time or 6 times (Table 3), and lower
for those who reported frequencies of abuse
between 2 and 5 times. Frequencies of physical and
sexual abuse were not significantly related to odds
of migraine diagnosis.
As a next step, we added current depression as
an additional control to account for the influence of
depressive state on the self-reporting of abuse items
(Table 4). This additional confounder lessened the
strength of the association between emotional
abuse and diagnosis of migraine. However, the

associations still remained significant. In the final
model, controlling for socio-demographic factors,
current depression and the other types of abuse
(physical and sexual), emotional abuse still
increased the odds of migraine diagnosis by about
1.5 times compared with those who were not
abused (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.30­1.67). A stepwise
increase in the odds ratio was also observed with
increasing number of types of abuse experienced by
the individual. Those who experienced all three
types of abuse showed the highest odds of develop-
ing migraine compared with those who did not
experience childhood abuse (OR 1.67; 95% CI
1.11­2.53).
Next, we examined the relationship between
migraine and childhood abuse controlling for life-
time diagnosis of depression and anxiety, and socio-
demographic factors (Table 5). Analyses revealed
that strength of association between report of "any
abuse" and migraine diagnosis lessened but
remained significant (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.18­1.56).
In investigating specific abuse types, this holds true
for emotional abuse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.20­1.58)
but not for sexual or physical abuse. We also
examined the relationship between number of types
of maltreatment experienced and odds of a
migraine diagnosis when adjusted for socio-
demographic factors, depression and anxiety. The
association with migraine increased significantly
(P < .05) in a stepwise fashion with increasing num-
ber of types of maltreatment reported by the
sample.

robustness of the results, subgroup analyses were
conducted by sex and race (Tables 2, 4, and 5).
Report of any abuse raised the odds of a migraine
diagnosis in both males (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.41­
2.31) and females (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.27­1.77).
When individual abuse types were regressed on
migraine diagnosis without adjusting for other
abuse types, emotional abuse and sexual abuse
were associated with higher odds of migraine diag-
nosis in both males and females while physical
abuse raised the odds of migraine diagnosis only in
females (Table 2). Emotional abuse, unadjusted for
physical and sexual abuse, increased the odds of
migraine diagnosis in males (OR 1.83; 95% CI
1.44­2.34) and in females (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.31­

1.79). Sexual abuse, unadjusted for physical and
emotional abuse, increased the odds of migraine
diagnosis and only in males (OR 2.13; 95% CI
1.14­3.97). Physical abuse, unadjusted for emotional
and sexual abuse, increased the odds of migraine
diagnosis only in females (OR 1.38; CI 1.13­1.68).
When all three types of abuse were entered into
the regression model together, only emotional
abuse showed a significant association with proba-
bility of migraine diagnosis in both males and
females (Table 2).
To explore the differences by race, we conducted
the analysis separately for non-Hispanic whites
(N 5 7960) and non-Hispanic blacks (N5 2962). The
regression estimates were different for these two
groups (Table 2). While the sample of non-Hispanic
whites showed an association between reported
abuse (any and individual types) and migraine diag-
nosis similar to the entire sample, the non-Hispanic
blacks sample did not show any associations between
abuse and migraine.
Temporal Relationships.--An estimated 1145
respondents reported both migraine and history of
childhood abuse and had valid responses for age
of onset of abuse and migraine. The mean age of
diagnosis of migraine was 19 years while the mean
age of onset of abuse was 11 years. Moreover, 954
(83%) respondents reported that abuse happened
before migraine was diagnosed while 140 (12%)
respondents reported that abuse happened after
migraine was diagnosed. Abuse and migraine diagno-
sis co-occurred (at the same age) among 51 (5%)
respondents. Bivariate linear regressions showed that
report of "any abuse" (b 5 20.35, P5 .39) or report
of emotional (b 5 20.25, P5 .53), sexual (b 5 20.75,
P5 .33), or physical (b 5 0.12, P 5 .80) abuse did not
have significant impact on the age of migraine diag-
nosis. Furthermore, the age when first abuse occurred
did not have a significant association with odds of
migraine diagnosis (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97­1.01).
An estimated 496 respondents with a history of
childhood abuse reported comorbid depression and
migraine and had valid responses for age of onset
of depression and migraine. The mean age of onset
of migraine was 19 years while the mean age of
onset of depression was 21 years. About 50% of

the respondents (n 5 246) reported that migraine
was diagnosed earlier than depression while 34%
(n5 170) reported that migraine was diagnosed after
depression. About 16% (n5 80) reported that
migraine and depression were diagnosed at the same
age.
Three hundred and forty-four respondents with
history of childhood abuse reported comorbid anxi-
ety and migraine, and had valid responses for age
of onset of anxiety and migraine. The mean age of
onset of migraine was 19 years while the mean age
of onset of anxiety was 22 years. Furthermore, 199
respondents (58%) reported that migraine was
diagnosed earlier than anxiety while 86 respondents
(25%) reported that migraine was diagnosed after
anxiety. About 59 (17%) reported that migraine
and anxiety were diagnosed at the same age.
DISCUSSION
We ascertained in a cross-sectional study of a
nationally representative sample of young adults
that emotional abuse in childhood, the most com-
mon type of maltreatment reported in this survey
(Tables 1 and Supporting Information Table S2),
was also the type most closely associated with
migraine (Tables 2, 4, and 5). Of the three adverse
childhood experiences evaluated, it was the only
one linked to migraine after adjusting for the other
abuse types, socio-demographic factors, lifetime
diagnosis of anxiety and depression, and current
depression.
In the Add Health population, prevalence of
emotional abuse approached 50%, using a broadly
worded question, "how often did a parent or other
adult caregiver say things that really hurt your feel-
ings or made you feel like you were not wanted or
loved?" We defined a positive response to the ques-
tion, even if occurring only one time, as abuse to
examine the frequency spectrum. Defining moderate
to severe emotional abuse as a positive response to
10 times yields a prevalence of 12%. This is compa-
rable with the 10.6% reported for "moderate to
severe" emotional abuse in the ACE study,6 where
the single question had a similar 2-part construct but
was more descriptive, and incorporated general fre-
quency ("often" or "very often"), and the threat of

physical violence, rather than emotional abandonment,
i.e., "Did a parent or other adult in the household
often or very often swear at you, insult you, or put
you down, or sometimes, often, or very often act in
a way that made you think that you might be physi-
cally hurt?" The 21.6% prevalence of moderate to
severe emotional abuse in the AMPP study5 sample
was determined by responses to the five-question
CTQ module regarding experiencing name calling
and other insults, feeling hated and unwanted, or
considered themselves emotionally abused. In those
with migraine (85% of the sample) the prevalence
was 22.5%, similar to what had been found using
the same instrument in a headache clinic-based sam-
ple of migraineurs, i.e., 20%, for moderate to severe
intensity, although 40% for mild to moderate inten-
sity.32 Differences in the socio-demographic compo-
sition of the study samples may have also played a
role in the varying prevalence rates of abuse.
Despite the differences in study populations, and in
measures of abuse and prevalence rates there is a
consistency of findings in the Add Health, ACE,6
and AMPP5 studies, each finding emotional abuse to
be the type of abuse most tightly associated with
migraine or frequent headache. Point estimates of
odds ratios (unadjusted for depression and anxiety)
in the studies were similar, ranging between 1.465
and 1.6.6
Emotional abuse in childhood is more frequent-
ly recalled by women than men, in our study as
well as in the ACE6 and AMPP5 studies. In post
hoc analyses of subgroups, we demonstrated a
higher odds ratio for the emotional abuse-migraine
association in males than in females, a finding not
previously reported. Of note, the association of
migraine and posttraumatic stress disorder, as eval-
uated in the cross-sectional, general population
National Comorbidity Survey Replication, was also
more robust in men.33 Reasons for sex-based differ-
ences in these associations with migraine are uncer-
tain, but from a biological perspective may be
related to variations of stress reactivity,34 inflamma-
tion,35 brain structural changes (particularly in the
corpus callosum),36 and unique sensitive periods for
stress-related structural changes.37 From a social
perspective, the gender-based differences in the
association may also be attributed to the fact that
women are more likely to seek mental health care
than men.38,39 Hence, it is possible that women
receive treatment more often for the initial abuse-
related trauma, thereby developing better coping
techniques than men. These hypotheses require
confirmation through continued research.
When stratified by race, the black/African-
American subgroup, which comprised 20.6% of the
population, did not demonstrate an association
between migraine and abuse, in adjusted analyses.
This stands in contrast to the association of
migraine and emotional abuse in the white/Cauca-
sian subgroup. Factors, including relatively small
sample size, genetic and epigenetic determinants of
resilience may be at play. This race-related differ-
ence is a novel finding requiring confirmation in
other samples.
Importance of emotional abuse as a risk factor
for mental health conditions has been recognized
globally. In 2015, for example, there were studies
from Australia, Asia, India, and Portugal,40­44 in
addition to a meta-analysis of all published litera-
ture,45 reporting strong links between emotional
abuse and depression, suicidality, and other psycho-
pathology. Migraine is comorbid with a number of
psychiatric conditions, particularly depression and
anxiety.46 Our data support a relationship of
migraine and emotional abuse, which is indepen-
dent of, although attenuated by, both depression
and anxiety. The finding that in over two-thirds of
participants the diagnosis of migraine either preced-
ed or was concomitant with the diagnoses of
depression and anxiety suggests that adjustment for
depression and anxiety may be an overcorrection.
The mechanism of the relationship of migraine
and emotional abuse is uncertain, but there is a
growing body of scientific study supporting neuro-
physiological links. Dysregulation of the neurohu-
moral, autonomic, immune, and metabolic systems
appears to be a consequence of maltreatment-
related stress, and may also play a role in
migraine.47 Areas of the brain structurally and func-
tionally affected by childhood abuse and by
migraine are also similar,48­51 and include the limbic
system structures, which connect to pain regions in
54 January 2017
the brainstem.51 Putative mechanisms by which early
life stress increases the likelihood of developing
migraine include gene x environment interactions, in
addition to epigenetic modifications via DNA
methylation.52
We demonstrated that onset of emotional abuse
precedes onset of migraine in 83% of cases, a novel
finding. Like in other studies,5­7 we found an increas-
ing odds of migraine with increasing number of
abuse types, i.e., a dose response relationship. Cau-
sality cannot be inferred from the abuse-migraine
associations found in cross-sectional analysis. We find
it intriguing, however, that several of Sir Bradford
Hill's nine criteria for establishing an argument for
causation53 have been met while examining the rela-
tionship between migraine and abuse, including the
temporal sequence, biological gradient (i.e., dose­
response), consistency of findings across research
sites and methods, specificity, coherence with natural
biology and progression of disease, analogous evi-
dence with abuse and mental health problems in lon-
gitudinal studies, and biological plausibility.
Another original finding is the U-shaped curve
based on frequency of occurrences for each sepa-
rate abuse type, even after controlling for current
depression and lifetime diagnosis of depression and
anxiety. Although this finding may be due to the
inaccuracies of the measurement tools for abuse
and migraine, we hypothesize a role for resilience
that with repeated events eventually becomes
strained. There is support for this conjecture from
animal and human studies showing that exposure to
stressors has a positive toughening effect when the
exposure is limited and there is an opportunity for
recovery.54 A multiyear longitudinal, study of the
effects of adversity on mental health-related out-
comes in a national sample demonstrated a similar
U-shaped relationship.55 Evaluating the reproduc-
ibility of our findings in other datasets is necessary.
Strengths of our investigation include the large,
nationally representative sample. The mean age of
adults in our study was 30 years old, which was
nearly two to three decades younger than the
means in other studies investigating the relationship
of abuse and headache,5­7 in adults. Also, the Add
Health survey queried all three major types of
childhood abuse, and we controlled for the other
two in the analysis of each abuse type. Unique to
this dataset are reports of frequency of each abuse
type and information on age of both abuse onset
and migraine diagnosis.
There are a number of limitations of the study
as it pertains to examining the relationship of
abuse, particularly emotional abuse, and migraine.
In any cross-sectional studies, causality cannot be
inferred from the association of variables. The most
often raised concern in retrospective studies of
events of childhood and adolescence is that abuse
is based on self-report and not on objective data,
such as court records, and therefore subject to
recall bias. The traumatic nature of the event(s),
the stigma of being perceived as "damaged," and
the passage of time may lead to under reporting.
Our finding that an affirmative answer to the emo-
tional abuse question, even for a single event, had
significant criterion validity for a number of out-
comes that have been tied to abuse, lends support
to accuracy of the recollection. This type of analysis
has not previously been done in the abuse-migraine
literature, but similar validity findings have been
reported for sexual abuse and physical abuse from
this data set.22 Although over-reporting of abuse is
thought to be less likely than under reporting,56 it
is possible that depression may negatively influence
memories of past experiences. To account for this
possibility, our analysis controlled for both lifetime
and current diagnosis of depression.
Other limitations of the study include the use of
self-reported healthcare provider diagnosis of life-
time depression, anxiety, and migraine but at least
in the case of current depression, we had a validated
tool (CES-D) of measurement over the preceding
seven days. In the case of migraine, investigators
in the Women's Health Study reported excellent
agreement between self-reported migraine and
ICHD-2 based migraine classification.57 This agree-
ment would likely also be true for healthcare provid-
er diagnosis, but there still may be participants who,
for personal, cultural, or socio-economic reasons,
have not seen a healthcare providers and therefore
have not been diagnosed with migraine (or depres-
sion or anxiety). However, controlling for income
Headache 55
and health insurance status, both of which are associ-
ated with access to health care, did not significantly
change the estimates. It is also reassuring that in our
study both the migraine prevalence (14%) and fema-
le:male ratio of migraine (2.5:1) are in keeping with
larger U.S. epidemiological studies using validated
instruments to ascertain migraine diagnosis.58 We
have looked at the influence of age of abuse onset,
number of occurrences of abuse, and number of
types of abuse on the relationship to migraine, but
other information, which may be germane to the out-
come, such as the severity of individual incidents, the
duration and ages over which abuse occurred, the
relationship to the perpetrator, and the available sup-
port system, is missing.
CONCLUSIONS
More than either physical or sexual abuse,
emotional abuse during childhood and adolescence,
even a single occurrence, predisposes an individual
to migraine. A causal relationship cannot be ascer-
tained from this study, but the gradient demonstrat-
ed by increasing association of abuse and migraine
with increasing number of types of abuse experi-
enced, and the temporal relationship wherein abuse
precedes development of migraine, supports the
hypothesis that there may be a causative pathway.
Further research to corroborate the influence of
emotional abuse on migraine and to understand the
potential mechanistic links is warranted.
