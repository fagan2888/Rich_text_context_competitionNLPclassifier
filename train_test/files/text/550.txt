INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization has identified obesity as a
global epidemic1 with rates of obesity, poor diet, and inadequate
exercise rapidly rising in children, adolescents, and adults.2­4
Obesity is a multisystem disease with potentially devastating
consequences for physical5­10 and emotional health11­14 across
the lifespan.
In adolescence, circadian timing is of critical importance.
Approximately 40% of teens select later bedtimes, a pattern
of behavior often referred to as an evening circadian prefer-
ence or eveningness.15­17 With the onset and progression of pu-
berty, evening preference adolescents exhibit a delayed sleep
schedule, whereby they increase activity later in the day and
both go to sleep and get up later.18 Indeed, Price et al.19 reported
that 60% of 11th and 12th graders who were surveyed reported
that they "enjoyed staying up late."
An eveningness circadian pattern has been linked to risk for
obesity in a handful of studies. Gonnissen et al.20 reported that,
in a sample of 13 adults who were experimentally induced into
either phase advanced or phase delayed circadian misalign-
ment, eating and sleeping at unusual times of day resulted in a
disturbed glucose and insulin metabolism. A study by Spaeth
et al.,21 in a large sample of adults, provides direct experimental
evidence that delaying bedtimes for 5 nights (and thereby re-
ducing sleep duration) results in significant weight gain within
a single week. Moreover, in a sample of 52 adults, Baron et al.22
showed that individuals with later bedtimes tended to consume
Objectives: The aim of the current study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between bedtimes and body mass index (BMI) from
adolescence to adulthood in a nationally representative sample.
Design: Three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to assess the bedtimes and BMI of 3,342
adolescents between 1994 and 2009. Hypotheses were tested with hierarchical linear models using a two-level, random intercept and slopes
model.
Results: Later average bedtime during the workweek, in hours, from adolescence to adulthood was associated with an increase in BMI over time
(b = 0.035 kg/m2 per min later bedtime per 6 years; standard error = 0.016; t = 2.12, degrees of freedom = 3,238, P < 0.05). These results remained
significant after controlling for demographic characteristics and baseline BMI. Although sleep duration, screen time, and exercise frequency
did not attenuate the relationship between workday bedtime and BMI over time, fast-food consumption was recognized as a significant partial
mediator of the relationship between bedtimes and BMI longitudinally.
Conclusions: The results highlight bedtimes as a potential target for weight management during adolescence and during the transition to
adulthood.

meals later in the day than those with earlier bedtimes. Com-
pared to those with earlier bedtimes, individuals with later bed-
times ate fewer fruits and vegetables and consumed an average
of 248 more calories, most of which were consumed at dinner
or after 20:00. Fleig and Randler23 found that later sleep timing
in adolescents on non-school days was associated with greater
"fast food" consumption. In a large sample of Australian ado-
lescents, those with late bedtimes were 1.47 times more likely
to be overweight or obese than those with early bedtimes and
more than twice as likely to be obese.24 Moreover, later bed-
times are associated with more screen time,25 which is associ-
ated with obesity26 and increased daytime sleepiness, which is
associated with decreased physical activity. 27 The cross-sec-
tional and experimental data indicate that bedtime is important
to consider when identifying risks for obesity.
Regular insufficient sleep and excessive daytime sleepi-
ness is another serious epidemic among adolescents. In several
studies with large samples of adolescents, researchers reported
that between 45% and 80% of adolescents experience insuf-
ficient sleep on school nights.28,16
Although the evidence is inconsistent, there is growing lit-
erature indicating a relationship between risk for obesity and
both insufficient sleep in adults and children and too much
sleep in adults. In a meta-analysis, Cappuccio et al.29 con-
cluded that cross-sectional studies from around the world show
a consistent increased risk of obesity amongst children who
are sleep deprived, and also a 60% to 80% increase in the odds
of being sleep deprived for obese children. Other researchers
have found that the relationship between sleep and risk for obe-
sity in adults holds to a curvilinear relationship, where both too
much sleep and too little sleep is associated with adverse im-
pacts on metabolic health.30,31 Thus, sleep is a plausible partial
mediator of the association between bedtime and weight gain.32
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no longitu-
dinal observational studies examining the relationship between

bedtime and change in body mass index (BMI). We endeavored
to explore whether later bedtimes would be associated with an
increase in BMI from adolescence to adulthood and whether
the relationship would be partially mediated by sleep duration,
fast-food consumption, screen time, and exercise frequency in
a longitudinal nationally representative data set.
METHODS
Sample
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health) is a longitudinal study in the United States that con-
tains data on the health and behavior of adolescents who were
in grades 7 to 12 in the first two waves of the study and 18 to
32 years of age in the third and fourth waves. Surveys were
administered at home and in school to adolescents and their
parents at wave I from September 1994 to April 1995. There
were three follow-up interviews: wave II in April-August 1996,
wave III in July 2001­April 2002, and wave IV in January
2008­February 2009. The current study only included data
from participants in waves II through IV of data collection. A
stratified random sampling of US high schools was included
(79% of targeted schools agreed to participate). The collection
of data followed informed consent procedures approved by the
institutional review board at the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill. The clustered sampling design was school based.
Several eligible high schools were selected and stratified by
region, urbanicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size, which
resulted in a final sample of 132 discrete schools. The current
analysis used the public-use data from the Add Health dataset.
The public-use dataset consists of one half of the core sample
that completed an in-home interview and includes an overs-
ample of African-American adolescents with a parent with a
college degree.
Measures
Sleep/circadian variables were determined via self-report
measures at all three waves. In wave II, all participants were
in school. Therefore, workday bedtime in wave II was defined
by response to the question "During the school year, what time
do you usually go to bed on week nights?" In waves III and
IV, workday bedtime was defined by response to the question
"On days when you go to work, school, or similar activities,
what time do you usually go to bed?" Workday bedtime was a
continuous variable; standard clock times were converted into
variables representing the number of hours and minutes from
noon, such that larger numbers indicate later bedtimes. For ex-
ample, individuals going to bed at 01:30 have a bedtime of 13.5
and individuals going to bed at 23:30 have a bedtime of 11.5.
Sleep duration was investigated as a potential partial medi-
ator. Rise times were not available at wave II; therefore, wave
II workday estimated total sleep time (TST) was defined by
response to the question "How many hours of sleep do you
usually get?" In waves III and IV workday TST was calculated
based on the workday bedtime and rise time reported at each
wave. Workday TST was a continuous variable, formatted in
hours with additional minutes as fractions of hours.
Investigators measured height and weight at each wave,
from which BMI was calculated. BMI in adolescents and
children is typically converted to a z-score because body fat
percentage changes as a child develops and in growing chil-
dren BMI also varies by sex. Therefore, BMI in children and
adolescents is not age and sex adjusted and thereby does not
accurately reflect norms unless converted to a z-score. How-
ever, in the current study, we are interested in change in an
individuals' BMI over time, and the age-adjusted norms are
less relevant. Moreover, in the current study age and sex have
been included as covariates to account for age-related differ-
ences in BMI. Some previous studies that examined individual
changes in BMI across this developmental period also did not
use age-adjusted BMI values.33­35
Fast-food consumption, television viewing, and exercise were
included as potential partial mediators. Fast-food consumption
is a continuous variable, defined by the number of times the ad-
olescent endorsed having consumed fast food in the past week.
Fast-food consumption was collected at all three waves. Screen
time per week is a continuous variable collected at each wave of
data collection and was determined by response to the question
"How many hours a week do you watch television?" Exercise
frequency at wave II is a continuous variable and was defined
by response to the question "During the past week, how many
times did you exercise, such as jogging, walking, doing ka-
rate, jumping rope, doing gymnastics or dancing?" Questions
assessing exercise frequency were inconsistent across waves,
posing a methodological challenge in assessing exercise fre-
quency across waves. Therefore, exercise frequency was based
only on data from wave II in the current study.
Demographic characteristics controlled for included age
(continuous; collected at all three waves), race/ethnicity (Af-
rican American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native
American, or white), and welfare status (one parent receiving
public assistance or no parent receiving public assistance).
A proxy for puberty was obtained via self-reported men-
arche for girls and levels of voice change for boys. Previous
research has shown that voice change is a good indicator of pu-
berty for boys.36­38 For voice change, boys were asked, "Is your
voice lower now than it was when you were in grade school?"
We combined some responses to create three categories for
boys' voice change (none, a little/somewhat, a lot/a whole lot
of change). For menarche, girls were asked the following yes/
no question: "Have you ever had a menstrual period (menstru-
ated)?" Pubertal status data were only collected at wave II.
Statistical Analyses
We tested whether later bedtimes would be associated with
an increase in BMI from adolescence to adulthood with hier-
archical linear models (HLM) using a two-level, random in-
tercept and slopes model. The HLM analyses were completed
using maximum likelihood estimation with STATA 12 soft-
ware (StatCorp, College Station, TX, 2011), utilizing methods
for cluster design survey data. All measures were centered at
the individual mean. Preliminary analyses determined that
there was a linear trend in the repeated measures for BMI (in-
traclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.75; 2 = 0; degrees of
freedom [df] = 3,238; P < 0.001) and workday bedtime (ICC
0.36; 2 = 0; df = 3,238; P < 0.001).
Longitudinal mediation analyses were conducted to explore
whether sleep duration, fast-food consumption, screen time,
SLEEP, Vol. 38, No. 10, 2015 1525 Bedtime and BMI--Asarnow et al.
and exercise frequency acted as partial mediators of the re-
lationship between bedtimes and BMI. The first multivariate
model (model 1) included age, wave II BMI, race/ethnicity pu-
bertal status, welfare status, and biological sex. The theorized
mediating variables of sleep duration, fast-food consumption,
screen time, and exercise frequency were progressively added
in subsequent models (models 2, 3, 4, and 5) to test whether
these variables acted as mediators of the relationship between
bedtime and BMI. We considered an attenuation of 10% in the
beta between bedtimes and BMI after including TST as a co-
variate to be consistent with mediation on an a priori basis.
RESULTS
A total of 3,342 participants comprised the sample for the
current study. Table 1 displays analyses on the relationship be-
tween weekday bedtime, covariates, and potential mediators
across waves.
Results for the tests of whether later bedtimes were asso-
ciated with an increase in BMI from adolescence to adult-
hood are shown in Table 2. Later average workday bedtime
(b = 0.048; standard error [SE] = 0.017; t = 2.80, df = 3,238,
P < 0.05) was associated with an increase in BMI controlling
for age, wave II BMI, pubertal status, welfare status, and sex.
In addition, even after controlling for covariates and potential
mediators (sleep duration, fast food consumption, exercise fre-
quency, and screen time) later average workday bedtime was
associated with an increase in BMI (b = 0.035; SE = 0.016;
t = 2.12, df = 3,238, P < 0.05).
Results for the tests to evaluate sleep duration, fast-food
consumption, exercise frequency, and screen time as poten-
tial mediators in the relationship between bedtimes and BMI
longitudinally are displayed in Table 2. The relationship be-
tween bedtime and BMI was not appreciably attenuated with
the inclusion of sleep duration, exercise frequency, and screen
time in subsequent models 2, 4, and 5, indicating that these
variables did not act as mediators of the relationship between
bedtime and BMI. However, the relationship between bedtime
and BMI was appreciably attenuated with the inclusion of fast-
food consumption (model 3).
No significant interactions were found between age and
sleep duration and age and bedtime during the workweek (all
Ps > 0.28).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to in-
vestigate the longitudinal relationship between bedtimes and
BMI in any age group in an observational study. Our results
indicate that later average bedtime during the workweek from

adolescence to adulthood was associated with an increase in
BMI over time in a nationally representative sample of more
than 3,000 participants. Going to bed during the workweek
each additional hour later is associated with an increase of 2.1
BMI kg/m2 (calculated by multiplying the beta (0.035) from the
fully adjusted model by 60 min/h). Indeed, a chronic pattern of
late sleep timing (over a period of 13­15 years) has been previ-
ously demonstrated to contribute to metabolic disturbance,20
which in turn may contribute to the physiologic processes un-
derlying the steeper increase in BMI observed in this study.
Our results were not consistent with sleep duration, screen
time, or exercise acting as partial mediators of the relation-
ship between bedtimes and BMI longitudinally. Although sur-
prising that these factors were not significant mediators, this
finding supports the importance of considering bedtime in
future research regarding the relationship between sleep and
BMI. Conversely, fast-food consumption was a significant par-
tial mediator of the relationship between bedtimes and BMI
longitudinally. The effect of later bedtimes upon dietary habits
therefore represents a potential target for future research and
intervention.
The results of the current study should be interpreted within
the confines of several limitations. First, "gold standard" mea-
sures for sleep and circadian rhythms such as sleep diary, ac-
tigraphy,39 and forced desynchrony protocols40 were not used.
However, the Add Health questions used as proxies are often
used as an index of TST and bedtime preference.41,42 Second,
all of the sleep data included in this study are based on self-
report. Although adolescents appear to be largely accurate and
reliable on self-report measures,43 it can be difficult to accu-
rately estimate one's sleep duration, bedtime, and wake times.
For example, participants may have been influenced by biases
such as most recent night or most salient night sleep44 and
adolescents may have incorporated their weekend bedtimes
and total sleep times into their assessment of what is "usual."
Although impractical in large epidemiological studies, future
research in smaller samples should endeavor to use the "gold
standard" tools to improve the contribution to knowledge.45
Third, measurements of waist circumference would have been
valuable. Unfortunately, waist circumference measurements
were not available at all three waves. Although BMI is a ra-
tiometric measurement that accounts for variation in height
over weight,46 it cannot distinguish between lean muscle and
abdominal fat. Fourth, Add Health questions assessing exer-
cise frequency were inconsistent across waves and therefore
exercise frequency across waves was not available. Instead, ex-
ercise frequency at wave II was included as a covariate. Future
research should investigate how exercise frequency over time
may contribute to the relationship between bedtime and BMI.
Last, loss to follow-up (n = 52) was related to baseline levels
of BMI in the current study (t = 3.62, P = 0). The reasons for
this pattern of findings are unknown. No other variables were
related to loss to follow-up.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the relationship between bedtime and BMI lon-
gitudinally in an observational study. Later average bedtime
during the workweek in the years from adolescence to adult-
hood was associated with an increase in BMI across that pe-
riod. These results remained significant even after controlling
for sleep duration, baseline BMI, demographic characteristics,
screen time, exercise frequency, and fast-food consumption.
Our results highlight adolescent bedtimes as a potential target
for weight management concurrently and in the transition to
adulthood.
