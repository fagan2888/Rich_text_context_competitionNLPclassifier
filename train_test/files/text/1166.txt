Background The prevalence of obesity and overweight is rapidly increasing in
industrialized countries, with long-term health and social conse-
quences. There is also a strong social patterning of obesity and
overweight, with a higher prevalence among women, racial/ethnic
minorities and those from a lower socio-economic position (SEP).
Most of the existing work in this area, however, is based on cross-
sectional data or single cohort studies. No national studies to date
have examined how social disparities in obesity and overweight differ
by age and historical period using longitudinal data with repeated
measures.
Methods We used panel data from the nationally representative Monitoring
the Future Study (1986­2004) to examine social disparities in
trajectories of body mass index (BMI) over adulthood (age 18­45).
Self-reported height and weight were collected in this annual US
survey of high-school seniors, followed biennially since 1976. Using
growth curve models, we analysed BMI trajectories over adulthood
by gender, race/ethnicity and lifetime SEP (measured by parents'
education and respondent's education).
Results BMI trajectories exhibit a curvilinear rate of change from age 18 to
45, but there was a strong period effect, such that weight gain was
more rapid for more recent cohorts. As a result, successive cohorts
become overweight (BMI425) at increasingly earlier points in the
life course. BMI scores were also consistently higher for women,
racial/ethnic minority groups and those from a lower SEP. However,
BMI scores for socially advantaged groups in recent cohorts were
actually higher than those for their socially disadvantaged counter-
parts who were born 10 years earlier.
Conclusions Results highlight the importance of social status and socio-
economic resources for maintaining optimal weight. Yet, even
those in advantaged social positions have experienced an increase
in BMI in recent years.

Introduction
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rapidly
increasing in industrialized countries,1­8 with exten-
sive health, economic and social implications.9­17
In the United States, currently two-thirds of adults
are overweight or obese.1,2,18,19 Increases in preva-
lence have taken place primarily since 1980 and have
occurred in all age groups simultaneously,1,3,6,18,20
prompting the use of the term `epidemic' to describe
these trends.
There is also repeated evidence of social disparities
in the prevalence of obesity and overweight. Data
from national surveys paint a consistent picture
where women, individuals of lower socio-economic
position (SEP) and minority racial/ethnic groups have
the highest rates of obesity and overweight.3,6,18,21­23
This is consistent with the argument that social
disadvantage is a `fundamental cause'24,25 of obesity
and overweight. People with more knowledge, money,
power, prestige and beneficial social connections are
better able to control weight gain, either through the
ability to make healthy food choices26,27 (by having
greater awareness of, access to, and resources to
purchase healthy foods), or through greater opportu-
nities for exercise, and safe play.28,29
However, much of the literature on social disparities
in obesity is based on data from repeated cross-
sectional surveys1,4,6 or from single cohort stud-
ies.3,30,31 As a result, it is difficult to determine
whether patterns of weight gain over the life course
represent true age effects or simply age differences in
the characteristics of cross-sectional samples over
time. Given the rapid secular changes that have
been occurring in obesity prevalence, social disparities
in trajectories of weight gain are likely to vary across
historical time. The timing of birth exposes each
generation or cohort to a particular window in
historical time with its own unique set of social and
environmental constraints and opportunities.32­34
Social patterns of weight gain are therefore inextric-
ably linked to the social and cultural conditions of the
larger society in which they are embedded across
time. Longitudinal data with repeated measures are
needed to identify how social disparities in obesity
and overweight differ by age and historical period.
We use nationally representative panel data from
the Monitoring the Future Study (MTF) in the United
States to examine social disparities in adult trajec-
tories of body mass index (BMI) from 1986 to 2004.
The MTF study is ideally suited to examine the recent
upsurge in obesity and overweight among Americans
since the early 1980s. With 19 years of data on annual
cohorts followed prospectively over adulthood (age
18­45), it is possible to simultaneously study indivi-
dual weight change as well as period shifts in BMI
over time. We hypothesize that BMI scores are
positively associated with both age and historical
time, such that BMI trajectories will become increas-
ingly steep in more-recent time periods. We also
hypothesize that BMI is inversely related to social and
economic advantage, such that, within each cohort,
adult BMI trajectories will be steeper for socially
disadvantaged subgroups (i.e. women, racial/ethnic
minorities and individuals of lower SEP).
Methods
Data
Data are drawn from the MTF project, a nation-wide
school-based survey conducted annually in the United
States since 1976.35 The study design (described in
more detail elsewhere)36 involves a nationally repre-
sentative sample of high-school seniors (age 18)
surveyed in the spring of each year ($15 000 per
year). For the panel component, a 16% representative
subsample ($2400 students per year) was randomly
selected from each cohort for six biennial follow-ups
(to the age of 30), and then at 5-year intervals to the
age of 45, using self-completed mailed questionnaires.
All procedures are reviewed and approved on an
annual basis by the University of Michigan's
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for compliance
with federal guidelines for the treatment of human
subjects.
To ease respondent burden in the MTF panel study,
multiple forms are used, with some questions
appearing on only some of the forms. Since 1986
a random one-sixth of respondents received forms
asking about height and weight. Thus, the final
sample available for this analysis consists of 10 956
individuals who were age 18­45 between 1986 and
2004. (Sample sizes for each high-school cohort
average 345 persons with up to nine observations
per person.)
Since subjects are selected in their senior year, the
survey does not include high-school dropouts.35 Drug
users were oversampled for participation in the panel
survey by a ratio of 3:1 (and then re-weighted for
analyses to reflect population estimates, as discussed
below). Student response rates in their senior year
average 82.7%. Retention rates in the panel respon-
dents are highest in the first follow-up after high
school (averaging 70% of the original cohort), and fall
to an average of 64% in the biennial follow-ups
through to age 32. Longer-term retention rates
average 50% at age 35, 57% at age 40 and 60% at
age 45.35 Using logistic regression analysis (with
backward elimination) we modelled the probability
of participation at each wave according to a broad
array of baseline socio-demographic characteristics
that could potentially influence study retention. Five
variables consistently predicted participation at each
wave: female, White, coming from a two-parent
family, enrolment in an academic high school and
not living in the southern region of the US at base-
line. By deriving the predicted probability of parti-
cipation from these five variables, each observation at
500 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
each wave of data collection was weighted to account
for attrition (losses to follow-up as well as survey
non-response) based on the inverse probability of
participation. Using this weight in our models
resulted in only trivial differences in the coefficients
in our results, ruling out the possibility that losses
due to attrition substantially bias our results.
Measures
We capture weight gain over adulthood with the BMI
(BMI ¼ kg/m2). Height was self-reported in inches
(converted to metres for these analyses), and weight
in pounds (converted to kilograms). Item non-
response for height and weight was small in this
panel survey, ranging from <1% (0.7%) to 2.3% over
the follow-up period. A BMI of 25 or higher is used to
define `overweight'.37 BMI scores were excluded for
pregnant women.
We focus on three key social indicators: (i) gender;
(ii) race/ethnicity; and (iii) lifetime SEP. Female is a
dummy variable coded 1 for females and 0 for males.
Race/ethnicity is represented by four dummy vari-
ables: White, Black, Hispanic and other racial/ethnic
group (includes Asians and Native Americans).
Consistent with a life-course perspective we include
SEP both in childhood and in adulthood. Childhood
SEP is the maximum of the respondent's parents'
education (less than high school, high-school
diploma, college degree or higher). Adult SEP is a
time-varying measure of completed education at each
follow-up (high-school diploma, college degree or
higher). [More sophisticated coding (differentiating
associate's degree, bachelor's degree or graduate
degree) did not yield differences in intercepts or
slopes in the growth model]. In order to capture
increases in socio-economic resources afforded by
marriage, we take the maximum of the respondent's
and spouse's education for those who were married at
each follow-up. Although SEP can also be measured
by income and occupation, social disparities in obesity
have typically been observed by educational levels and
less consistently by income.4 As a result, we focus on
educational attainment over the life course as our
measure of SEP.
Statistical analyses
Growth curve models38 were used to examine
trajectories of BMI over adulthood. Growth curve
models belong to a general class of mixed models that
take into consideration the clustering of observations
within persons and also have the capacity to handle
unbalanced designs (inconsistent number of observa-
tions per person).39 A two-level linear model was
analysed, with multiple observations nested within
persons over time (adulthood). Age was used as the
indicator of time. In order to facilitate parameter
interpretation, we centred age at the initial point of
data collection (age 18).
The structure of this model can be expressed by equa-
tions at two levels. At level 1 (within-person model)
BMI scores at time t are nested within individuals (i):
BMIti
¼ 0i
þ 1i age À 18
ð Þti
þrti
ð1Þ
where 0i
is the expected BMI score for person i at
age 18 (since age is centred), 1i captures the rate of
change in BMI over the life course, and rti is the
within-person residual (that part of an individual's
BMI at time t not predicted by age).
To incorporate period effects we also include the year
of data collection as a time-varying variable, again
centred on the initial year that BMI data were collected
(1986). This allows us to examine period shifts in BMI
across all ages. (Cohort effects integrate age and period
effects by capturing variations in BMI across groups of
individuals in the same high-school year as they age. We
do not focus on cohort effects in this paper. Rather, we
examine period differences in age patterns of BMI over
adulthood.) We examine how adult trajectory slopes
vary across historical time by modelling interactions
between the age and year variables:
BMIti
¼ 0i
þ1i
ðage À 18Þti
þ2i
ðyear À 1986Þti
þ3i
ðage À 18Þti
ðyear À 1986Þti
þrti
ð2Þ
The level-1 parameters are then modelled as a
function of individual characteristics (at level two).
The level two (between person) submodel assumes
that BMI trajectories vary across individuals, and we
explicitly model these differences as follows:
0i
¼ 00
þ 01
ðfemaleÞi
þ e0i
ð2:1Þ
1i
¼ 10
þ 11
ðfemaleÞi
þ e1i
ð2:2Þ
2i
¼ 20
þ e2i
ð2:3Þ
3i
¼ 30
ð2:4Þ
Here, for example, the intercept and age slope from
equation (1) are modelled as a function of gender,
where 01 represents the difference in the initial BMI
score for females compared with males, and 11
captures the difference in the rate of change in BMI
over adulthood for women compared with men. (We
also modelled person-level differences in the slope for
year, but found no effects.) The residual errors
(e0i
; e1i
; e2i) capture random variance in the intercept
and slope values across persons, which we attempt
to capture through the incorporation of additional
person-level variables. (Due to model limitations on
the number of estimated variance components, we set
the random variance for the age by year term to zero.)
Substituting equations (2.1) through (2.4) into
equation (1) gives us the full composite model:

SOCIAL DISPARITIES IN BMI TRAJECTORIES ACROSS ADULTHOOD 501
We used the MIXED procedure in SAS to estimate
all models using full maximum likelihood, assuming
normally distributed residuals. (The distribution of the
residuals showed a good approximation to normality,
with little deviation from the diagonal in the normal
probability plots.) All analyses were weighted to correct
for the oversampling of drug users in the panel data.
Nested models were compared according to three
goodness-of-fit indices: (i) change in the À2 log like-
lihood (or deviance statistic), which follows a 2
distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the
difference in the number of parameters tested between
models; (ii) change in the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC), which makes an adjustment for
model parsimony;40 and (iii) proportion of variance in
BMI that is explained by a model (pseudo R2),
calculated by squaring the correlation between the
observed and predicted BMI values.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The individuals in this study were born between 1958
and 1985, with the majority (53%) born before 1971.
Socio-demographic characteristics for the study
sample at baseline (age 18) are presented in
Table 1. Approximately one-quarter (26.2%) went on
to receive a college degree over the follow-up period.
Table 2 presents the weighted mean BMI scores for
the study sample over adulthood. Three specific high-
school cohorts are illustrated. Mean BMI scores
increase over adulthood, but at any given age BMI
scores are higher in more recent cohorts.
Unconditional growth model
The first column in Table 3 (Model A) presents the
results for the unconditional growth model without
any person-level covariates. The value for the inter-
cept (22.4) represents the average BMI score at age
18. The coefficients for age express the average rate
of change in BMI over adulthood. A second-order
polynomial indicates that BMI scores increase steadily
over young adulthood and then begin to flatten out
towards midlife, as illustrated in Figure 1. After
incorporating the effects of age, variation in BMI
remains both within persons and between persons
(variance components), and additional person-level
variables may explain this variation. Note that ageing
itself explains about 6.5% of the total variance in BMI
scores.
Incorporating period effects
The second column of Table 3 (Model B) incorporates
the period effect. The positive coefficient for year
indicates that BMI scores have increased linearly since
1986, at an average rate of 2.3 BMI units every decade
since 1986. BMI trajectories were then allowed to vary
by historical time by including interactions between
age and the year of data collection (Model C in
Table 3). Compared with the model including only
age, the inclusion of secular time results in an
improvement in model fit and accounts for about
34% of the residual variation between individual
trajectories [(0.165­0.109)/0.165]. Together, ageing
and historical time explain about 8% of the total
variation in BMI scores.
A visual depiction of this age and period effect is
presented in Figure 2. For simplicity, only three
specific high-school cohorts are illustrated. Members
of the earliest cohort (born in 1958) were high-school
seniors in 1976. Although height and weight data are
not available for this cohort until the age of 28
(in 1986), the BMI trajectory for this group exhibits a

gradual increase over adulthood. However, for each
successive cohort, BMI scores are higher and the early
adult BMI trajectory becomes increasingly steep. As
a result, successive cohorts become `overweight'
(BMI425) at increasingly earlier points in the life
course.
Examining social disparities
The models in Table 4 examine social disparities in
adult BMI trajectories over time. As a reference point,
the first column in Table 4 replicates the coefficients
from Model C in Table 3.
Disparities by gender and race/ethnicity
The second and third columns of Table 4 add the
effects of gender and race/ethnicity to the age and
period effect model. Females and racial/ethnic
minority groups are at greater risk of weight gain
over the adult life course than white males (Model C).
(There were no statistical interactions between any of
the socio-demographic characteristics and the period
effect). However, since 1986 there has been a
convergence in BMI scores by racial/ethnic groups
across cohorts. Figure 3 illustrates racial differences in
BMI trajectories across the same three high-school
cohorts depicted in Figure 2, but for simplicity we
plot trajectories for women only since there are no
differences in the BMI trajectories between Whites
and other race/ethnic groups and between Blacks and
Hispanics (Table 4, Model C), predicted BMI trajec-
tories are only plotted for Whites and Blacks for
illustrative purposes.
As illustrated in Figure 3, BMI scores are con-
sistently higher across adulthood for racial/ethnic
minority groups than for whites. However, over
time the BMI trajectories for whites tend to track
those for Blacks from earlier cohorts. For example,
BMI scores for white women in the class of 1986
tend to approach those of black women in the 1976
cohort over the equivalent age range (age 28­36,
Figure 3). Similarly, early adult BMI scores for white
women in the 1996 cohort track closely those for
Black women who graduated from high school 10
years earlier.
Disparities by lifetime SEP
The fourth column of Table 4 (Model D) adds
childhood SEP to the model. Consistent with a
life-course perspective on health disparities, higher
SEP in childhood is protective of weight gain both at
the age of 18 and over adulthood. Individuals who
have a background of lower SEP in childhood
(parents with less than college degree) have a
higher BMI at age 18 (initial status) and also have

higher rates of annual growth in BMI over adulthood
than those whose parents had a college degree.
Childhood SEP accounts for only a small part of the
effect of racial/ethnic disadvantage [largely for
Hispanics, see Table 4 (Model D)], indicating that
there are other factors associated with racial/ethnic
position that carry an increased risk for higher BMI
that are not simply a function of SEP at birth.
However, because of the period effect, even white
males from a high SEP have been gaining weight
more rapidly over adulthood in more-recent cohorts.
Figure 4 illustrates BMI trajectories for white males in
the three separate high-school cohorts according to
childhood SEP. While BMI scores are consistently
higher in each cohort amongst those with lower
childhood SEP (parents with less than a high-school
education), at each age BMI scores for socially
advantaged groups in later cohorts are actually
higher than those for their socially disadvantaged
counterparts who were born 10 years earlier.
The protective effects of adult SEP over the life
course are weaker than for childhood SEP (Table 4,
Model E). High-school seniors who go on to receive
a college degree have somewhat flatter BMI trajec-
tories over adulthood than their classmates who did
not pursue further education. However, achieved SEP
in adulthood does not fully mediate the lingering
effects of childhood SEP. Model E simultaneously
adjusts for adult SEP and examines the residual
effect of childhood SEP on BMI after accounting for
the mediating effects of adult SEP. Thus, social
disadvantage in childhood carries a persisting risk
for increased BMI throughout the life course. (There
were no statistical interaction effects between gender
and adult SEP, race and adult SEP or between
childhood SEP and adult SEP.) Together, these
socio-demographic characteristics, along with ageing
and historical time, explain over 12% of the total
variation in BMI scores over adulthood (final model
Table 4).
Discussion
We use 19 years of nationally representative panel
data for repeated cohorts of Americans to describe
adult trajectories of BMI since 1986. We found that,
not only do BMI scores follow a curvilinear course
over adulthood, but there has also been a linear
increase in adult BMI trajectories over historical
time. Thus, historical conditions have differentially
affected adult trajectories of weight gain since the
mid-1980s. As a result, one's BMI later in adulthood
may have less to do with one's age than with
historical changes in social, environmental and
cultural conditions that significantly influence caloric
balance.41­44
We also found evidence of a `social patterning'45 in
adult trajectories of BMI. Weight gain over adulthood
is more rapid for disadvantaged social groups,
including women, racial/ethnic minorities and those
of lower SEP. As a result, social disparities in BMI
become increasingly more pronounced over the adult
life course, which has ominous implications for future
health disparities among these cohorts as they age.
Targeted interventions towards these groups,46­48
particularly early in the life course,49,50 remain an
important and worthwhile strategy.
However, BMI scores have also been rising steadily
in socially advantaged groups since 1986. Even white
males in a high SEP are at an increased risk for
weight gain at any given age over time. This has
implications for preventive strategies. If the rise in
obesity, as a public health concern, is approached
from a `fundamental cause' perspective,24 weight gain
is assumed to be the result of restricted access to
health-enhancing knowledge and resources among
disadvantaged social groups. But our results indicate
that another strategy may need to be considered for
the prevention of obesity in the more advantaged
subgroups of society. These people presumably have
access to resources but are failing to use them

SOCIAL DISPARITIES IN BMI TRAJECTORIES ACROSS ADULTHOOD 505
effectively. Similar findings are beginning to appear in
the literature, where social advantage does not confer
the expected protective effects against weight gain in
American adults.51­53 However, if these advantaged
social groups begin adopting better nutrition and
exercise behaviours afforded to them by their flexible
social resources,25 we may observe a decline in their
BMI trajectory over time, and this will only serve to
magnify the socio-economic gradient in obesity and
overweight in future years.
Limitations
Due to the underestimation of weight in self-reported
data,54 BMI scores in this sample may be higher if
weight were measured directly. However, because
there is no evidence of differential underreporting of
weight in ethnic or racial minority groups, or by
gender or SEP, the social patterns in BMI are not
likely to differ markedly from those reported here.
Because study subjects were selected in their senior
year of high school, high-school dropouts are not
represented. Although panel attrition in the MTF data
is nontrivial, statistically adjusting for attrition yielded
no differences in the results. Because follow-up is
ongoing in this study, relatively fewer data points are
available for estimation at the tail end of the growth
curves (age 35­45) in these analyses.
Our purpose in this paper was to describe social
disparities in BMI over adulthood as they change over
historical time. The results highlight the importance
of social status and socio-economic resources for
maintaining optimal weight. Yet, even those in
advantaged social positions, presumably with access
to health-enhancing resources, have experienced an
increase in BMI in more recent cohorts. Thus,
promoting access to resources and opportunities for
healthy eating and exercise may not be sufficient for
overturning the obesity epidemic.

KEY MESSAGES
 No national studies to date have examined how social disparities in obesity and overweight differ by
age and historical period using longitudinal data with repeated measures.
 Using panel data from the nationally representative MTF Study (1986­2004) in the United States to
examine social disparities in trajectories of BMI over adulthood (age 18­45), we found a strong period
effect, such that weight gain was more rapid for more recent cohorts; as a result, successive cohorts
become overweight (BMI 4 25) at increasingly earlier points in the life course.
 BMI scores were consistently higher for women, racial/ethnic minority groups and those from a lower
SEP.
 However, BMI scores for socially advantaged groups in recent cohorts were actually higher than those
for their socially disadvantaged counterparts who were born 10 years earlier.

Commentary: Closing the disparity gaps
in obesity
Boyd A Swinburn
Accepted 4 December 2008
The two big challenges that obesity presents us with
are how to reduce its overall burden and how to
reduce its associated disparities--especially the dis-
parities by socio-economic position (SEP) and ethni-
city. The paper by Clarke et al.1 in this issue elegantly
highlights the epidemiology of the obesity epidemic
in relation to the changing patterns in the USA across
gender, ethnicity, SEP, age and cohort. As shown in
this and other US studies in adults and children,2­4
the inter-relationships between these factors are
complex and changing over time. Sophisticated
studies, such as this analysis of the Monitoring the
Future Study (MTS), are needed to help untangle
the various contributions of these determinants to
the prevalence and, more importantly, the trends in
obesity. For example, the findings that the ethnic
and SEP disparities in body mass index (BMI) seem
to increase over the life course of the population
(longitudinal analyses) but decrease over time (serial
cross-sectional analyses) is subtle but important--the
gaps between Whites and Blacks or between advan-
taged and disadvantaged are greater for older age
groups but are overall less now than they used to be.
Longitudinal studies consistently show that people
with lower SEP gain more weight than those with
higher SEP,5 but these findings need to be combined
with monitoring of population trends to determine
whether the SEP gap is narrowing or widening. The
MTS data to 2004 seem to suggest that the SEP gap
is narrowing over time. This is somewhat contrary
to the expectation that any flattening of the obesity
trajectory will occur earlier in the more advantaged
sections of the community, thus widening the SEP
gap. This will be a very important gap to keep a close
eye on as the obesity epidemic unfolds.
Despite the complex, inter-related nature of the
determinants of obesity, there are a few clear mes-
sages coming through from the research findings.
