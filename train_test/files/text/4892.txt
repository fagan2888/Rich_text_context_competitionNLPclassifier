Introduction
Many university teachers may often feel that the pressure in
favor of grade inflation and a lowering of standards is relent-
less. They may be tempted to identify such pressure as being
exerted by the business interests of their university, driven in
turn by student demands to make courses easier. The view of
Sadler (2009) is that "grade inflation occurs when high
grades are awarded for progressively lower and lower
achievements" (p. 823). It also implies that some students,
who would not otherwise do so, will pass assessments. He
argues for grade integrity, which
is defined as the extent to which each grade awarded, either at
the conclusion of a course or module of study, or for an extended
response to an assessment task, is strictly commensurate with
the quality, breadth and depth of a student's performance.
(Sadler, 2009, p. 807)
A number of harmful consequences of grade inflation have
been identified. It leads to a compression of grades, making it
difficult for employers to distinguish between students of dif-
ferent abilities. Different degrees of grade inflation lead to
uneven, and hence unfair, assessment (Abbott, 2008). The
credibility of grades can be undermined so that employers turn
to other methods of evaluating job applicants (Wongsurawat,
2009). In terms of the theories of Spence (2002), the fact that
a graduate owns a degree at a particular grade would be send-
ing a misleading signal to potential employers.
It is understandable in such situations to regard teaching
staff as defending academic standards on largely ethical
grounds in opposition to business interests, which would be
served by easier degree courses. This would be unfortunate.
By broadening the perspective and looking at some of the
economic forces that influence demand for degrees, it can be
seen that well-established and validated marketing theory
does not suggest that there will always be this conflict
between academic and business interests.
To test this theory in the context of online education, we
conducted a survey aimed at online students who were just
about to complete their online master's degrees offered by
the University of Liverpool. The participants were asked
about the effect on the perceived value of their degrees of a
number of changes which were directly or indirectly associ-
ated with grade inflation. These changes were generally seen
as reducing the value of their degrees, thus potentially harm-
ing the business interests of the university.

Abstract
This article questions whether there is a conflict between the academic and business interests of a university in addressing
grade inflation. A survey of online master's degree students at a British university was carried out. It asked students about
a number of possible changes aimed at reducing the sacrifices involved in gaining a degree; making it less likely that students
would fail modules or their degree; and reducing the degree drop-out rate to almost zero. Changes in the perceived value
of a degree or the university's perceived reputation were measured. The conclusion is that students saw such changes as
reducing the value of their degree. The research suggests that in certain circumstances, academic and business interests can
be aligned in opposing grade inflation.

implies that the cost of goods can be too low as well as too
high. Teas and Agarwal (2000) write about extrinsic product
cues, such as price and brand name, affecting in a positive
way perceptions of quality. André Gabor, one of the pioneers
in the field of research about price as an indicator of quality,
gives examples of products that increased their sales when
they put up their prices. He maintains that such judgments
about quality are based more on consumers' experience than
on their ignorance.
Gabor (1988) concludes that
the customer bent on a purchase will approach the market with
two price limits in mind: an upper limit beyond which he would
consider the item too expensive for his purposes. And a lower
limit below which he could not trust the quality (p.254).
Between this upper and lower limit, price will not act as
an absolute barrier to purchase (Gabor & Granger, 1966).
This builds on earlier insights by French researchers whose
work is not quite as accessible to those working in the English
language (Adam, 1958; Stoetzel, 1954).
Marketing theory is flexible enough to realize that there
are costs that are not related to financial price involved in the
acquisition of goods and services. These total perceived
costs, financial and non-financial, are often referred to as the
give or sacrifice (Zeithaml, 1988). The latter term is particu-
larly pertinent to university students taking a degree. The
stress involved in balancing competing demands on time can
be considerable. The suffering involved in acquiring a degree
is particularly acute among part-time mature students who
have so many more commitments than their younger full-
time counterparts. These are the kind of students who are
taught on completely online master's degree programs run
by Laureate Online Education on behalf of the University of
Liverpool. The university is believed to be the biggest pro-
vider of online master's degrees in Europe. The students
have an average age of around 38, and are drawn from all
parts of the world.
The current authors' research focused on the question of
whether it is possible that, in certain circumstances, degrees
that involve greater sacrifice are perceived as having more
value. Conversely, those degrees which involve few sacri-
fices could be seen as being of poor quality. If this is so, then
there may well be an alignment of academic and business
interests. The teacher who protects academic standards could
be maintaining the value and economic desirability of the
product.
Perceived Value
Alves (2010) conducted a wide ranging review of the litera-
ture on perceived value in higher education. Sancjez-
Fernandez and Iniesta-Bonillo (2007) performed a similar
service in looking at perceived value in general. Some of the
literature treats perceived value as the net value of a product
after all the pluses and minuses have been added up. In the
definition of Zeithaml (1988), perceived value is "the con-
sumer's overall assessment of the utility of a product based
on perceptions of what is received and what is given" (p. 14).
The weakness of this is that it hides much of the detail. In
particular, it does not tell us whether a high level of sacrifice
is perceived as a plus or a minus. Too often, the sacrifice is
seen as unambiguously negative, ignoring the obvious exam-
ple of luxury goods where a high price is often seen as a posi-
tive feature.
Adjuncts
The term adjunct is peculiar to certain countries, particularly
the United States, and it is not in widespread use in the
United Kingdom. It usually refers to a part-time teacher
without security of employment. A number of studies have
suggested that the greater use of adjuncts, particularly in
online classes, has contributed to the increase in grade infla-
tion. Because there is no convenient British equivalent, the
term adjunct will be used here.
If grade inflation is the result of inexorable pressures on
degrees that rely on the use of adjuncts, then this would tend
to undermine the argument in this article. This is because the
University of Liverpool qualifications delivered by Laureate
Online Education are taught almost exclusively by adjuncts.
The evidence must therefore be considered.
Kezim, Pariseau, and Quinn (2005) looked at grades at an
American college over a 20-year period and concluded that
adjuncts contributed to additional grade inflation. A popular
explanation of this phenomenon is that adjuncts are judged
largely or exclusively on student evaluations, and higher
grades are a means of trying to increase popularity. The inse-
curity of employment experienced by adjuncts is suspected
of increasing this desire to curry favor.
Ewing (2011) found there was a positive correlation
between students' expected grades and their evaluations of
teachers. The study of Love and Kotchen (2010) concludes
that "increased institutional emphasis on teaching evalua-
tions can exacerbate the problems of grade inflation and
inadvertently lower faculty teaching effort" (p. 162).
The research of Langbein (2008) discovered that actual
and expected grades had an effect on student evaluations of
teaching. Because of the widespread use of such evaluation
methods in the United States, she feared that they would fuel
universal grade inflation, although this would be particularly
acute in private colleges. Eiszler's (2002) examination of
more than 900,000 student evaluations concludes that they
were significantly related to expected grades. Crumbley,
Flinn, and Reichelt (2010) feel that student evaluations
encourage a range of unethical behavior in teachers aimed at
improving ratings without increasing learning.
Bar, Kadiyali, and Zussman's (2009) study reports that
"in the spring semester of 1998, Cornell University started
publishing median course grades on the Internet. Our
Kingsley and Sharon 3
analysis finds that the provision of grade information online
induced students to select leniently graded courses" (p. 107).
In assessing the impact of such practices on adjuncts,
Sonner (2000) finds that adjunct instructors, keen to improve
their evaluation results, did give higher grades than full-time
teachers. Cavanaugh's (2006) research suggests that a typical
student would receive a B grade from an adjunct and a C
from a full-time member of staff. It is not perhaps an accident
that most of the evidence for grade inflation is coming from
those who teach undergraduates in the United States.
The degrees which are featured in this current article are
normally taught by teachers who are all adjuncts. Their mod-
ule managers, faculty managers, and directors of online stud-
ies are also adjuncts. A large number of these come from the
United States, where grade inflation might well be a daily
reality of their teaching on campus. All online teachers are
subject to student evaluations at the end of every module. At
the same time, there has, to date, been a strong culture of
opposing grade inflation.
The degree programs described in this article apply very
strict grading criteria. Only around 20% of the students could
expect to receive A or A* grades. This can be contrasted with
the case at Princeton University, which reported as a success
the fact that the proportion of A+, A, and A- grades on
undergraduate courses had fallen from 47.9% in 2002-2003
to 39.7% in 2008-2009 (Quinones, 2009). International stu-
dents are generally advised that a Grade C at Liverpool is
equivalent to Grade B in the United States. There is no inter-
nal evidence that grades have increased over the decade in
which the oldest of the University of Liverpool online
degrees have been provided. How is that possible?
The answer is that instructors can normally gain no advan-
tage by providing higher grades to students in the absence of
evidence that work of superior quality has been produced.
Although student evaluations are used, they constitute just
one of many indicators of performance for online teachers.
Alongside such evidence, a faculty manager will consider
whether the grading profile of a teacher is significantly dif-
ferent from his or her peers. It would certainly be considered
undesirable if popularity had been bought, intentionally or
otherwise, by the offering of higher grades. Thus, a teacher
demonstrates that he or she is valuable to the university
partly by showing that he or she does not award higher grades
without justification.
The conclusion is that there is nothing inevitable about
grade inflation in circumstances where there is an intensive
use of adjuncts subject to student evaluations. The negative
consequences are purely the result of specific academic or
business decisions, which in turn seem to be the result of
very poor management. If a university chooses to make
appointment and promotion decisions based solely or pre-
dominantly on student evaluations, particularly in the face of
evidence that undergraduates respond to those who grade
generously, then it should expect to be embarrassed.
In the world of online education, where all interactions
can be stored in a virtual learning environment, there is no
excuse for lazy management. A broad range of data is typi-
cally available in an electronic form so that more rounded
evaluations of teachers can take place. Teaching in a goldfish
bowl, where teachers realize that everything they have ever
written to any student in the last 10 years is available to
external regulatory bodies such as the Quality Assurance
Agency for Higher Education (QAA), is not always comfort-
able. It does, however, provide relatively unambiguous evi-
dence of who did and said what to whom. Unjustified
criticisms of instructors can be refuted by documentary evi-
dence, and teaching staff are less reliant on receiving positive
feedback in circumstances where difficult decisions have to
be made.
Oleinik (2009) pessimistically concludes that "grade
inflation results from the substitution of criteria specific to
the search for truth by criteria of quality control generated
outside of academia" (p. 156). He did not foresee that certain
systems of quality control would be aimed at preventing
grade inflation on the understanding that courses with
inflated grades are of reduced quality.
Areas for Investigation
In this study, the approach was to isolate a number of vari-
ables to see whether something interesting, and possibly
unexpected, could be identified. A cluster of three issues was
identified, which might be seen as associated with grade
inflation and a lowering of academic standards.
1. The level of sacrifice involved in obtaining a stu-
dent's degree. We asked respondents to ignore the
cost of fees and concentrate on other sacrifices they
had made. The question of tuition fee costs as a sign
of quality was tested separately.
2. The proportion of students who failed their degree or
individual modules (a module is an intensive class
lasting 8 weeks). The survey asked about the case
where the number of failures was very low. It was
reasoned that where grades were uniformly inflated,
the number of failures would fall, and that questions
such as this would be the easiest way of testing atti-
tudes toward grade inflation.
3. The numbers of students who dropped out of their
degree. Ormond Simpson (2003), in a book based on
his experiences at the Open University in the United
Kingdom, expresses the opinion that "an institution
that awarded its own qualifications and had zero
dropout might have difficulty in persuading both its
students and the general public that its qualifications
were worth having" (p. 11). Part of the current
authors' research was aimed at establishing how far
this was true.
4 SAGE Open
The responses to some of the questions would probably
depend on the current situation. The reaction of students
could be different if they were enrolled on a degree course
where grades were already inflated. As has been noted, the
baseline position was that grade inflation was not a problem,
and students would therefore be expected to work hard for
good grades. It could not be considered easy to pass the
degrees in question. This is consistent with what colleagues
in marketing would call the positioning of the degrees.
Two authors who pioneered the programs, Kalman and
Leng (2007), write about "the widespread public suspicion
that this educational [online] paradigm will be associated
with low standards and quality." They concluded that, in
overcoming this perception, "quality cannot be bought
cheaply" (p.59). Computing colleagues, Grasso and Leng
(2005), state that "we believe firmly that the successful pro-
grammes of the future will be those that focus on pedagogy,
and give precedence to academic standards and quality
assurance, rather than those that emphasize technological
aspects or focus on low-cost delivery" (p. 2386). This meets
the concerns expressed by Thirunarayanan (2001) a decade
ago that online education might lead to people receiving
degrees who did not really deserve them.
A decision was taken to gather students' views through
the medium of an anonymous online survey. What the survey
sought to measure was perceived value. Students were not
asked to apply a range of objective criteria in making their
judgments. In general, they were simply asked whether cer-
tain things increased or decreased the value or quality of
their degree in their eyes.
Method
An online survey was carried out in 60 small Research
Methods classes of the University of Liverpool's online mas-
ter's degree programs. The main subjects were computing,
business administration, and management, with smaller
numbers from public health and clinical research administra-
tion. Research Methods is the module students take toward
the end of their degree immediately before attempting their
dissertation, and after completing 8 other modules (a module
is an 8-week class). Some 369 students completed the survey
anonymously with a response rate of 44.8%.
One of the concerns of using a publicly visible online sur-
vey is that, either through misplaced enthusiasm or malice,
the web address could be made available to those outside the
target audience. There is then a danger that the sample could
be corrupted by the presence of large numbers of respon-
dents whom the researchers did not want to take part.
To reduce the risks of this happening, and to limit the
damage if it did, the authors used what they called, some-
what tongue in cheek, the New Titanic Method. It will be
recalled that the RMS Titanic was meant to have a number of
watertight compartments which would help it stay afloat if
the hull was breached. In practice, the compartments were
not watertight, and the damage inflicted by a collision with
an iceberg was so severe that the vessel sank.
The response was to divide the online survey into a number
of compartments that were a little more watertight than those
on the Titanic. For each of the 60 classes that were surveyed, a
blackboard message (internal email) was sent to every mem-
ber of a particular class inviting them to take part in the survey.
Each class was directed to a separate web address.
The service that was used, SurveyGizmo, made it easy to
generate new instances of the survey, each of which had its
own web address. Hence, there were 60 copies of the survey
residing at 60 web addresses, and generating 60 separate data
sets. These data sets were combined during the analysis.
The consequence of adopting this approach was that if a
single web address was leaked to a wider audience, only one
compartment in our survey ship would be flooded by invalid
data. It could then be disregarded without corrupting the
whole survey. In the event, there is no evidence that such a
leak occurred. The numbers responding to the survey never
exceeded, or even approached, the number of students in
each class.
Many respondents did not have English as their first lan-
guage, and so they were asked to indicate whether any ques-
tion in the survey was so difficult for them to understand that
their reply might not reflect their true opinion. Where a stu-
dent indicated that a question fell into that category, the
response to that question was discounted.
Students were asked for their age and gender, and the sur-
vey service that was used, SurveyGizmo, identified their
location from their IP address. Students were asked about the
actual sacrifices they had made compared with the sacrifices
they expected to make; how important it was to them that
their degree was being awarded by the University of
Liverpool; their level of satisfaction with their degree course;
and the survey asked about their views on the relationship
between tuition fees and course quality.
The core of the survey addressed questions of perceived
value in situations where changes were made that would gener-
ally make the course easier. These were grouped as follows:
1. Questions that asked about the effect on the perceived
value of the degree if, shortly after the student's grad-
uation, changes were made that resulted in modules
being much easier to pass, students being unlikely to
drop out of their degree because it was too difficult,
or students finding that gaining a degree involved far
fewer sacrifices.
2. Questions about the effect on the perceived value of
the degree if it involved very little non-monetary sac-
rifice, students hardly ever failed, or the drop-out rate
was close to zero.
3. Questions about the effect on the University of
Liverpool's reputation if students rarely failed mod-
ules or rarely dropped out because the work was too
hard.
Kingsley and Sharon 5
For the most part, semantic differential questions were
used, with possible options ranging from 7 (increased value/
higher reputation) to 1 (decreased value/lower reputation).
This has been treated as interval data for which the mean
score can legitimately be calculated. The choice by partici-
pants of the mid-point value 4 was assumed to indicate a
degree of neutrality or indifference toward the issue in ques-
tion; scores of 5 to 7 were interpreted as being broadly posi-
tive, and scores of 1 to 3 negative. The results which were
consistent with the authors' expectations would involve a
mixture of high and low scores.
Results
Sacrifice and Tuition Fees
Some 79% of students indicated that their degree had
involved greater sacrifices than they had expected. Only 5%
thought it involved less sacrifices. The mean score was 5.5.
At the same time, 88% of the sample were satisfied with their
degree (M = 5.7) and 88% would recommend their degree to
others (M = 5.9). It can therefore be seen that there is no
incompatibility between high student satisfaction and a
higher than expected degree of sacrifice.
The assumption had been that high tuition fees would not
be a strong indicator of course quality, and that other aspects
of the give or sacrifice involved in obtaining a degree would
be more important. This was confirmed by the survey. When
asked whether courses with high tuition fees were typically
of better quality than those with lower tuition fees, respon-
dents produced a mean score of 3.8 (median = 4). The num-
bers of positive, neutral, and negative responses were almost
precisely equal.
Changes to Degrees After Graduation
Possibly the most significant results from the survey were
produced by the questions that asked about future changes
that would make degrees easier in certain specified respects
after the student had graduated. The general conclusion was
that students would see such changes as devaluing their
degree. This would be likely to generate significant negative
word-of-mouth (as well as negative social network and email
traffic) about their degree program.
If, in future, it would be much easier to pass each module
on the degree, 69% of the respondents felt that this would
decrease the value of their degree and only 14% believed that
its value would increase (M = 2.8, median = 3). Similarly,
66% saw a future degree that would involve far fewer sacri-
fices on the part of students as involving a lowering of value.
Just 12% of the sample thought this would increase the
degree's value (M = 3.0, median = 3).
Throughout the survey, respondents were less concerned
about low drop-out rates as a negative indictor, but 52% of
the sample believed that a future in which students would be
unlikely to drop out of their degree because it was too diffi-
cult would signal a qualification that had less value. Twenty-
five percent took the contrary view (M = 3.4, median = 3).
The mean scores for these three questions are highlighted in
Figure 1. The percentage of respondents who thought these
changes would be positive or negative is represented in
Figure 2.
Less Sacrifice, Low Failure/Drop-Out Rates
The next set of questions involved subtle differences in
wording. Instead of being asked about failing modules, stu-
dents were quizzed about their view if people hardly ever
failed their degree. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents felt
this would decrease the value of the qualification. This repre-
sented a slight softening of attitudes, because degree failure
was clearly a harsher penalty than module failure, and hence
a higher price to pay for degree quality. However, the polar-
ity of student opinion was clear, with only 14% feeling the
degree would increase in value (M = 3.2, median = 3).
When asked how they would rate their degree if it involved
very little sacrifice on their part, 60% said their qualification
would decrease in value, with 15% taking the contrary view

(M = 3.1, median = 3). A drop-out rate close to zero was seen
as a negative thing by 46% of the respondents, whereas 23%
saw it as positive (M = 3.6, median = 4). In this case, the rea-
son for dropping out was not mentioned in the question. A
summary of the relevant percentages is set out in Figure 3.
The University's Reputation
The University of Liverpool brand proved to have been an
important factor in attracting students to their degree pro-
gram. Many online degrees are offered by institutions whose
names are not immediately recognizable. Liverpool is one of
the older British civic or redbrick universities formed around
the turn of the 20th century. It is a member of the Russell
Group, a collection of research-intensive universities in the
United Kingdom.
In the survey, 85% of the students indicated that the fact
that the University of Liverpool was offering their degree
was important or very important. Only 6% thought this fac-
tor was unimportant (M = 5.9, median = 6). Students were
therefore asked about the effect of certain scenarios on the
Liverpool brand. The result of students rarely failing mod-
ules on their degree course would, in the opinion of 49% of
the respondents, lower the reputation of the university (M =
3.5, median = 4).
A very significant 29% of the sample opted for the mid-
point value on the scale, indicating some degree of indiffer-
ence. If that assumption of indifference is correct, then the
natural conclusion is that the university does not need to
worry about the reaction of a certain proportion of its stu-
dents to modules getting easier. The reaction is likely to be
neither positive nor negative. The focus will therefore switch
to the proportions of students who react positively (22% in
this case) and negatively (49%). On balance, therefore, it
was concluded that modules that are rarely failed would
damage the reputation of the university.
The sample was also asked about the effect on the
University of Liverpool reputation if students rarely dropped
out because the work was too hard. Here the results were
inconclusive. The split meant that 35% thought this change
would lower the reputation of the university, 36% thought it
would give Liverpool a higher reputation, and 29% were
indifferent (M = 4.0, median = 4).
Although the question did specify a particular reason why
students might drop out of degree courses, informal feedback
suggested some participants might have taken account of
other reasons, such as illness or a change in personal circum-
stances. The retention of students under these difficult cir-
cumstances would be seen as a positive sign. It was also
likely that the reputation of the university was considered so
robust that changes were less likely to damage its image.
It was concluded that the use of drop-out rates as a signal
of perceived value was problematical and any future research
would require more incisive questioning to separate out the
various factors involved.
Demographics
Gender, geography, and age. Just 33% of the survey sample
was female. There were no statistically significant differ-
ences (p < .05) with the one- or two-tailed test in the answers
provided by men and women.
In analyzing the sample according to the part of the world
in which students were resident, the only significant differ-
ences were between the 21% of students who came from
Africa and the rest. The results of this analysis are presented
in Table 1. African students were more likely to believe that
the sacrifices they had had to make were greater than
expected (p = .0001) and to value the Liverpool brand in
choosing their degree (p = .00003). They were less likely to
believe that future changes after their graduation that would
make their degrees easier would reduce the value of those
degrees. In the case where it would be much easier to pass
each module, p = .002; where it would be unlikely for stu-
dents to drop out because the degree was too difficult, p =
.0007; where gaining a degree in the future would require far
fewer sacrifices, p = .01. African students were more satis-
fied with their degree (p = .0000005) and more likely to rec-
ommend it to someone else (p = .002). In almost all cases,
the polarity of African and non-African students' views was
the same, meaning they were both positive or negative in
relation to any particular question, but one group's attitudes
were stronger to a statistically significant degree. The two
questions where there was an opposite polarity were the
above mentioned case about future changes where students
would be less likely to drop out (African M = 4.1, non-Afri-
can M = 3.3), and the question that asked about the effect on
Liverpool's reputation if students rarely dropped out (African
M = 4.5, non-African M = 3.9).
An examination of correlation results showed that the
relationship between age and other variables was almost
completely random. Although age was not generally a deter-
minant of outcomes, there were a few statistically significant
Figure 3. Percentages of those who saw features as having a
positive or negative effect on the value of the degree.

differences when comparing students who were above 40
(38% of the sample) with the rest (the mean age of students
was 38). The older group felt in Q4 that the damage to the
university's reputation where students rarely dropped out
would be greater than it was in the eyes of younger students
(p = .04). Similarly, the above 40s were in Q8 more con-
cerned by future changes that would make it easier to pass
each module (p = .02). They were a little more inclined in
Q13 to believe that degrees with high tuition fees are of bet-
ter quality (p = .04). In Table 2, the lower scores indicate a
lower perceived value or greater damage to the university's
reputation.
Degree comparisons. In comparing the results across degree
programs, the most noticeable feature was that there were
relatively few statistically significant differences. To isolate
any variations that were peculiar to a particular degree pro-
gram, a series of t test comparisons were conducted in which
those in Degree X were compared with a combined group
consisting of those not in Degree X.
Computing students felt that they had made slightly fewer
sacrifices to obtain their degree than other students (p =
.006). With respect to future changes after graduation that
would make it easier to pass each module (p = .04) and make
it unlikely that students would drop out because their degree
was too difficult (p = .03), computing students were a little
more likely to see these changes as negative. The level of
module failure (p = .0004) and degree dropout (p = .008) at
which students could not recommend their degree to others
was higher than among non-computing students.
Management students were studying for an MBA or an
MSc in management. These two groups did not display statis-
tically significant differences, except in two less crucial
areas--the latter felt the Liverpool brand was more important
in choosing their degree, and they were more satisfied with
their program. They were therefore treated as one group.
In a kind of mirror image of the computing students, the
respondents taking management degrees felt they had made
greater sacrifices than expected (p = .0008). In choosing a
level at which the module failure rate was too high to recom-
mend their degree to others, management students named a
lower figure than other respondents (p = .006).
Clinical research administration students were a little less
likely to recommend their degree to others (p = .005). In
other respects, they were very similar in their views to those
of other students taking other degrees.
Public health students had a higher average age of 41.
They made up just 10% of the total sample, and therefore, the
comparisons should be treated with some caution because of
the relatively small numbers involved. However, it was noted
that public health students were rather less concerned about
the effect of low drop-out rates on the value of their degree
(p = .03) or on the reputation of the university (p = .05). They
were similarly less bothered by the effect of lower module
failure rates on the university's reputation (p = .0006), to the
extent that, on this question, they actually saw the change as
slightly positive (M = 4.2). They were even more likely to
recommend their degree to others (p = .04). The percentage
at which module failure rates cast doubt on the quality of
their degree is lower for public health students (p = .02), as is
the percentage drop-out rate at which the degree could not be
recommended to others (p = .03).
Not Enough Sacrifice?
The authors wanted to get an idea of when the level of stu-
dent module failures and dropouts due to the difficulty of the
degree was considered too high or too low. To answer these

questions, use was made of some techniques employed in the
Price Sensitivity Meter of the Dutch economist Peter van
Westendorp. The typical use of the Price Sensitivity Meter is
to establish when the price of a product or service is consid-
ered to be too high or too low by potential consumers. It
often helps in setting the price of a new product or in estab-
lishing whether the current price of a product is appropriate
(Lipovetsky, Magnan, & Zanetti-Polzi, 2011).
The approach of van Westendorp was adapted to the
slightly different situation being addressed by ourselves.
Whereas the original technique would ask when the price
was too low for it to be of good quality, in this study, respon-
dents were asked about the average percentage of students
who fail each module:
Q14: At what percentage would you consider the failure
rate to be so low that the degree's quality would be
doubted?
In relation to the percentage of students who decide to
withdraw from their degree course (drop out) before the dis-
sertation stage because the degree is too hard, the corre-
sponding question was as follows:
Q16: At what percentage would you consider the drop-
out rate to be so low that the degree's quality would be
doubted?
The application of the Price Sensitivity Meter would then
normally involve asking respondents when the price was so
high that they would not consider buying the product. The
two questions that were asked in this survey to test the case
where values were deemed to be too high were as follows:
Q15: At what percentage would you consider the failure
rate to be so high that the degree could not be recom-
mended to others?
Q17: At what percentage would you consider the drop-
out rate to be so high that the degree could not be rec-
ommended to others?
In all cases, respondents were asked to select a value from
a drop down menu. The values available were in a range
from 0% to 100% with 5% increments. The very first option
on the menu was "No figure is too low" in the case where we
were asking about values that were too low and "No figure is
too high" when we were asking about values that were too
high. Thus, participants were given every opportunity to
indicate that they were not concerned about this issue.
Although these questions were in a well-established for-
mat, and the wording was as clear as it could reasonably be
made, the concepts involved were not necessarily easy to
grasp. The authors therefore included an optional question at
the end of the survey:
Were any of our questions so difficult to understand that your
reply might not reflect your true opinion?
For most of the survey questions, the numbers indicating
this degree of difficulty in understanding a question were
very small. In the case of Questions 14 to 17, it was more
significant. The percentages indicating a degree of difficulty
for these four questions were 14.1%, 10.8%, 16.5%, and
11.9%.
The analysis of the data erred on the side of caution by
discounting the replies to questions where respondents had
indicated that their reply might not reflect their true opinion.
However, a statistical examination of the replies to Questions
14 to 17 of those who did and did not indicate this difficulty
showed that the difference between the mean values was not
statistically significant (p < .05) for any of the four questions.
In terms of the median scores, the inclusion of respondents
who had doubts about their reply reflecting their true opinion
would not have changed the median at all in the first three
questions. For Q17, the effect would have been to increase
the median from 45 to 50. The conclusion was that the doubts
that some respondents experienced had affected their
responses in the most trivial of ways. The exclusion of those
who had doubts did not affect the median or mean scores to
any significant degree.
The right hand column in Table 3 has been interpreted as
the proportion of students who were indifferent to module
failure or drop-out rates in assessing degree quality (Q14 and
Q16) or in deciding whether to recommend their degree to
others (Q15 and Q17).
The replies to Questions 15 and 17, which asked about
when values were too high, were something of a surprise,
but were consistent throughout the phased conduct of the
survey. They indicated that the level of satisfaction students
felt with their degree course was such that only when fail-
ure or drop-out rates were approaching 50% would a major-
ity begin to stop recommending their degree to others in

large numbers. The results did indicate a high tolerance of
significant failure and drop-out rates on the part of the more
retainable students.
In Questions 14 and 16, the authors have taken a cautious
approach in drawing conclusions about minimum module
failure and drop-out rates by focusing on the median values.
It does seem clear that if these rates were to fall below 10%,
then large numbers of students are likely to see this as indi-
cating a reduction in degree quality. A reasonable interpreta-
tion of the data in Table 3 is that an average of 0% module
failures would be interpreted as a reduction in degree quality
by 87.5% of the students. A drop-out rate of 0% would be
similarly interpreted by 84.1% of the participants.
Park and Choi (2009) outline a number of ways in which
retention can be improved by legitimate means without grade
inflation. There is, however, likely to be a level beyond
which it is unwise to go if the perceived value of degrees is
to be maintained.
In other questions, participants were asked about a drop-
out rate that was close to zero, or where students rarely
dropped out because the work was too hard. It was felt that
asking about the situation where no-one dropped out would
be tantamount to asking about a situation that would never,
in practice, happen. Respondents would have probably not
seen this as a credible scenario. Although those taking the
survey might not have difficulty in assessing the effect on
perceived value of drop-out rates that were close to zero, or
situations where students rarely dropped out, there was
always the danger that they would privately define those
terms differently.
Q16, inspired by the Price Sensitivity Meter, showed that
a large majority of students were able to nominate a drop-out
rate at which the degree's quality would be doubted, and just
15.9% rejected the notion that there was any such figure.
It does seem to be a requirement of students' willingness
to undergo a certain amount of suffering to obtain their
degree that such hardship is not seen as unjust or unreason-
able. The degree satisfaction rates revealed in this survey
suggest that there is no such perception. Theoretically, this
can be linked back to the work of André Gabor (1967), who
maintained that a price (sacrifice) that was seen as neither
too high nor too low by buyers and sellers could be regarded
as a just price for a product or service.
The authors do acknowledge that where a university has a
reputation for recruiting the most talented and motivated stu-
dents in a particular country, such as is the case with the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the United
Kingdom, the perceptions of what constitutes an acceptable
minimum drop-out rate may well be much lower. In the
absence of such exceptional factors, it has been concluded
that there will routinely be minimum failure and drop-out
rates below which it would be unwise for a university to fall.
Degrees where everyone passes and nobody drops out
because the work is too hard will typically be viewed as qual-
ifications of poor quality.
Until around the 1960s, there was a reasonably wide-
spread belief that a lower price was always better for the cus-
tomer. This was not based on strong empirical evidence, and
when empirical studies were carried out, it was soon discov-
ered that prices could be too low as well as too high, and that
this finding was not limited to the special case where rich
buyers were trying to impress their friends (Gabor & Granger,
1966; Shapiro, 1968). Some 50 years later, we may be on the
verge of acknowledging the business problems created by
universities whose degrees are obtained at a level of suffer-
ing that is too low.
Correlation Analysis
Where students were satisfied with their degree, they would
typically recommend it to others. A correlation of .76
between these two variables underlined this close relation-
ship. The results of the correlation analysis are shown in
Table 4.
The key questions in the survey, which asked about how
changes or different scenarios would affect the quality of
degrees or the reputation of the university, were Q2 to Q9.
In Questions 8, 9, and 10, respondents were asked to indi-
cate whether the suggested change would increase or
decrease the value of their degree. It will be recalled that in
each case, students were presented with a 7-point semantic
differential scale. See the Appendix for the wording of
questions.
An analysis showed that there were a few questions where
replies were quite well correlated (> .40) with other responses.
A key question was the following:

Q6: If students on your degree rarely failed modules, how
would that affect the University of Liverpool's
reputation?
Respondents were asked to select a point on a scale indi-
cating whether the university would have a higher or lower
reputation. The replies were well correlated with six out of
seven similar questions, indicating that it was a reasonable
predictor of other attitudes. Knowing the answer to this ques-
tion would provide a fair indication of (correlation figures in
brackets) the value of the student's degree if people hardly
ever failed (.59); its value if the drop-out rate was close to 0
(.46); the effect on the university's reputation if students
rarely dropped out because the work was too hard (.52); the
respondent's attitude if, in the future, each module was much
easier to pass (.43); the attitude toward a future change where
students would be unlikely to drop out because their degree
is too difficult (.41); and the student's attitude toward a
degree that would in future require far fewer sacrifices (.45).
Establishing the relationship between concepts by math-
ematical means is sometimes a little like typing a letter wear-
ing boxing gloves, but the mathematical relationships can be
suggestive. For the authors, the cluster of correlations around
Q6 pointed to the centrality of the Liverpool brand and to
anything that would damage the university's reputation.
It has already been seen that the brand was an important
factor in students choosing their degree. The most natural
interpretation of the data is that if a degree's becoming easier
is seen as damaging the brand, then similar changes (as
described in other questions) would also be seen in a nega-
tive light. Only where the change was not seen as damaging
the brand would it be viewed as having no harmful effect on
the quality of a degree. This is also true of future changes that
might be made after graduation. Such changes were likely to
be seen as diluting the value of a Liverpool degree obtained
at some point in the past.
The other area with the highest correlations was that relat-
ing to future changes after graduation. The correlations were
Q8 to Q9, .54; Q8 to Q10, .48; and Q9 to Q10, .58. Students
tended to see such changes as being distinctly all positive or
all negative.
Discussion
Reduced Value
The results of the survey show that, at least in certain circum-
stances, students do perceive high pass rates, low drop-out
rates, and degrees that involve very little sacrifice on their
part as reducing the value of their qualification. This percep-
tion is particularly strong in the case where post-graduation
changes are proposed that would make the degree easier to
obtain. Students who have made great sacrifices to gain a
master's degree would be particularly unhappy at seeing
their degree devalued.
The survey sample consisted of students who were survi-
vors. Those who had dropped out (typically in the first or
second module of the degree) could have a different view.
However, the authors'informed conjecture is that the support
services offered to online students by Laureate and Liverpool
are gradually eliminating avoidable dropouts. Those who
leave are increasingly likely to be those who see how hard
the online program is and realize that they cannot fit it into
their schedule.
If this is true, then at least some of these early dropouts
are possibly a necessary evil in proving that this example of
online education is not an easy option. It would seem a far
better business option to appeal to those who are similar to
the people in the sample who had demonstrated that they
were retainable. Their desire is for degrees that, through the
sacrifices involved, indicate their high value.
The authors' research highlighted a cluster of interesting
variables. It is possible that other variables will have an
effect on students'attitudes toward degrees that are challeng-
ing. Further research in comparing the influence of different
variables would be welcomed.
The high proportion of students who felt that their degree
had involved greater sacrifices than they expected does sug-
gest that, at the time of their enrolling for the degree, the
marketing and other university literature did not prepare
them satisfactorily for what was to come. This may have
changed in more recent times.
This does point to the dangers of being unduly positive in
promotional material. It can inflate avoidable drop-out rates.
First, because those who have believed the myths about
online education being an easy option do not have those
myths sufficiently dispelled by what they read about their
degree. This encourages applications from people who are
not suited to the workload or the pedagogical/andragogical
model used. Such people might not apply if promotional
material consistently pointed out how difficult study was
likely to be.
Second, being more realistic in public statements would
reduce the number of avoidable dropouts among students
who felt that they were failures because they found online
education extremely challenging. A university can say, "This
degree course is going to be very difficult, but ultimately
rewarding. You will experience many problems in balancing
all your commitments, but we have the support services that
can help you."
Such an approach would tend to engender different expec-
tations, so that the student might think, "I have problems, but
this is normal. It does not mean that I am inadequate." It is
also likely that there are strong potential students who have
believed the stories about online education being an easy,
low-quality option (which in some cases might be true). It is
possible that more honest marketing, telling them that they
will have to suffer to gain a degree, would actually have a
positive appeal. It could open up new markets by astute prod-
uct positioning. In terms of signaling theory, it could be said
Kingsley and Sharon 11
that the university would be sending a signal to potential
buyers that its products were of high value (Spence, 2002).
The data suggest that retainable students taking the mas-
ter's degrees discussed in this article see factors that add to
the difficulty in obtaining their qualification as increasing its
perceived value. This will inevitably influence their word-
of-mouth recommendations (and these days that includes rec-
ommendations made by electronic means of communication).
In this case, there is strong evidence that academic and busi-
ness interests are aligned. Pressures for grade inflation and a
degree obtained with fewer sacrifices are likely to undermine
the value of the product and make it less attractive in the eyes
of retainable students.
A business manager who was asked "How difficult is it to
resist the temptations of grade inflation?" could reasonably
reply, "It is quite easy. Grade inflation would damage our
business by making the product less attractive."
The Potential Scope of These Findings
Under what circumstances are these factors likely to apply?
What is the scope of these conclusions? Marketing theory
suggests that when an organization is selling a high value,
high price product, the high price can be a positive attraction.
This is because it makes the product exclusive. The owner
possesses something that others do not have.
In education, it is the total sacrifice involved in obtaining
a degree, rather than the level of fees, that provides this
exclusivity. Conversations between the authors and online
students after graduation ceremonies suggest that it is pre-
cisely because students have suffered to gain their degree
that they regard it as having a high value. Under no circum-
stances would they accept that studying online was an easy
option.
Are all degrees likely to engender this feeling in their stu-
dents? Almost certainly not. A master's degree, particularly
one from a reputable university (one with a strong brand) is
still something that sets an employee apart from others. It
does, in many circumstances, still provide a career advan-
tage. It is exclusive because large numbers of people do not
have a master's degree. In such circumstances, the business
pressures to combat grade inflation are likely to be strong.
Although the amount of fees charged is not in itself crucial in
indicating the quality or value of the degree, it is likely that
students who perceive their degree as having a high value are
more willing to pay high fees.
On the other hand, where the possession of certain kinds
of degrees becomes commonplace (a bachelor's degree in
some countries, for instance), the product takes on more of
the features of mass-produced consumer goods. Here there
are more pressures to drive the price down. In education
terms, the emphasis switches to the importance of the grade
that is obtained, because the mere possession of a degree has
a reduced value. The pressure here is often to reduce the
amount of sacrifice involved in getting a good grade.
Pressman (2007) would identify this as demand-pull infla-
tion, where too many students are chasing too few jobs.
It is clearly much easier to prevent grade inflation that has
not historically taken place than it is to reduce grades that
have become inflated. Once the proportion of A grades has
risen above 40%, it is difficult to get the genie back in the
bottle. However, the business case for doing so is suggested
by the results of this research. There is a market for high-
value degrees, the acquisition of which involves a significant
amount of suffering on the part of the student. Indeed, it is
possible to argue for the necessity of suffering. The student
who has suffered is likely to believe that he or she has
obtained a prize of great value.
Where degree programs require a high level of student
participation, such as in the numerous assessed asynchro-
nous online discussions favored by Liverpool, a campaign
against grade inflation might also be a good way of getting
students to work harder and participate to the desired extent.
Babcock (2009), in surveying a large number of students at
the University of California, San Diego, concluded that
holding fixed instructor and course, classes in which students
expect higher grades are found to be classes in which students
study significantly less. Results indicate that average study time
would be about 50% lower in a class in which the average
expected grade was an "A" than in the same course taught by the
same instructor in which students expected a "C." (p. 983)
Although the University of Liverpool degrees are deliv-
ered in conjunction with an American private sector organi-
zation, Laureate Online Education, the authors have noted no
pressures for grade inflation from their paymasters in their
day to day teaching. There is therefore little cost-push pres-
sure for grade inflation where teachers are encouraged to
give higher grades by their institution (Pressman, 2007).
Why? Because it would be bad for business.
The pressure is likely to be in the opposite direction, par-
ticularly in the case of Americans and other instructors who
might be operating in on-campus courses characterized by
rampant grade inflation. When they become online teachers
at Liverpool, they have to adjust quickly to their new
environment.
On the demand side of the equation, Liverpool students
may wish that the assignment they are currently completing
were not so time-consuming. In the passing moment, they
may wish for an easier life. However, in the longer term, they
value the suffering they have had to undergo. This may not
be universally true, but it would be surprising if there were
not general lessons to be learned here. The sacrifice is transi-
tory, but positive recommendations persist over the long
term.
Ledden and Kalafatis (2010) highlight the fact that
degrees can have a different perceived value at different
times. Therefore, when we ask students about perceived
value might be important. Asking students during a
12 SAGE Open
temporary period of suffering might give a distorted view of
the long-term benefits of such experiences to students who
will, in graduating, gain a prize of great value.
Conclusion
Pricing theory suggests that the price of a product can be too
low as well as too high. That price can include non-financial
contributions the buyer has to make in acquiring the product.
It can, for instance, include the sacrifices the student makes
in acquiring a degree. The greater the sacrifice, the greater
the perceived value of the product can be.
It therefore does not follow from this body of theory that
there are inexorable pressures to reduce student sacrifices by
making degrees easier to obtain. There are theoretical
grounds for believing that, at least in certain circumstances,
a high level of sacrifice will increase the perceived value of
a degree. This suggests that there are some situations where
the ethical demand of teachers to maintain academic stan-
dards could be quite compatible with the business goals of a
university in maintaining the value of the product it sells.
To test the applicability of this body of theory to the online
degree programs of a prominent British university, the
authors conducted a survey among students coming toward
the end of their master's degrees and asked what their reac-
tion would be if certain changes were introduced that would
make their degrees easier to obtain. These changes included
a reduction in failure rates, a reduction in drop-out rates, and
a reduction in the sacrifices made in obtaining the degree in
question.
A lower percentage of failures and fewer sacrifices were
clearly seen as reducing the value of the degree. Lower drop-
out rates did, on balance, suggest the same conclusion, but
with some ambiguity. The results showed that failure and
drop-out rates would need to reach very high levels before
students would stop recommending their degree to others.
The conclusion was that positioning a degree successfully
as a high-value, high-cost product that is difficult to obtain
would produce a situation where the business interests of a
university would lie in combatting grade inflation. The busi-
ness and academic interests of the university in maintaining
standards would tend to coincide.
