Research Summary
We use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,197) to
consider the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on 9-year-old children. We
find that maternal incarceration has no average effects on child wellbeing (measured
by caregiver-reported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing
problem behaviors, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition scores, and child-
reported early juvenile delinquency) but that the effects vary by mothers' propensities
for experiencing incarceration. Maternal incarceration is deleterious for children of
mothers least likely to experience incarceration but mostly inconsequential for children
of mothers more likely to experience incarceration.
Policy Implications
It is important that public policies take into account the fact that not all children
experience similar effects of maternal incarceration. For children of mothers who are
unlikely to experience incarceration, the negative consequences of maternal incarcera-
tion could be driven by at least three factors, all of which may operate simultaneously
and all of which potentially call for different policy interventions: (a) jail incarceration

In response to dramatic, highly concentrated increases in the American incarcera-
tion rate throughout the last four decades (e.g., Bonczar, 2003; Sampson and Loeffler,
2010; Western, 2006), scholars have developed an acute interest in the growing, yet re-
cently stabilized, population of children who experience parental incarceration (Wildeman,
2009). Most of this research has explored the intergenerational consequences of paternal
incarceration (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2007; Geller, Cooper, Garfinkel, Schwartz-Soicher,
and Mincy, 2012; Hagan and Foster, 2012a; Murray and Farrington, 2005, 2008; Roettger
and Boardman, 2012; Roettger and Swisher, 2011; Wakefield and Wildeman, 2011, 2013;
Wildeman, 2010), which is unsurprising given that children have a much higher cumulative
risk of experiencing paternal, rather than maternal, incarceration (Wildeman, 2009).
But recent decades have witnessed striking relative increases in maternal incarcera-
tion, especially among poor and minority children (Wildeman, 2009), and accordingly, a
burgeoning literature has considered the intergenerational consequences of maternal incar-
ceration (for reviews, see Arditti, 2012a, 2012b; Eddy and Poehlmann, 2010). Quantitative
research in this area often has estimated the average effects of maternal incarceration on
indicators of child wellbeing including internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors,
test scores, and delinquency (e.g., Cho, 2009; Dallaire, Zeman, and Thrash, 2014; Foster
and Hagan, 2013; Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Poehlmann, 2005; Wildeman and Turney,
2014). Some of this research has found that maternal incarceration, on average, is detri-
mental to children (Hagan and Foster, 2012b), whereas other research has suggested it is
inconsequential (Wildeman and Turney, 2014) or dependent on the outcome (Foster and
Hagan, 2013; Lee, Fang, and Luo, 2013; Murray, Farrington, and Sekol, 2012). The varia-
tion in the effects of maternal incarceration is strikingly apparent in the rich and textured
qualitative literature (Arditti, 2012a; Giordano, 2010; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic, Rodriguez,
and Pratt, 2012).
Despite compelling indications of heterogeneous effects within qualitative research
studies, as well as inconsistency in the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of
findings across quantitative research studies, no broadly representative quantitative research
has provided a systematic examination of the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration
on children's problem behaviors, test scores, or delinquency. Therefore, in this article, we
use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWB), a birth cohort
126 Criminology & Public Policy

of children born to mostly unmarried parents in urban areas, and a series of propensity
score matching techniques to consider whether the effects of maternal incarceration vary by
the social contexts that shape children's likelihoods of experiencing maternal incarceration.
Specifically, we consider heterogeneity in the effects of maternal incarceration, according
to maternal propensities to experience incarceration, across four indicators of wellbeing in
middle childhood: caregiver-reported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported
externalizing problem behaviors, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition (PPVT-
III) scores, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency. Although these data have been
used extensively to consider the effects of paternal incarceration on children, few researchers
have considered the effects of maternal incarceration (see Geller, Garfinkel, Cooper, and
Mincy, 2009; Wildeman and Turney, 2014), and no studies using these data have considered
variation in the relationship between maternal incarceration and children's wellbeing by
the propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration. This lack of research is a missed
opportunity on the research side as these data include established measures of wellbeing in
middle childhood contain a large number of children exposed to maternal incarceration,
and include incarcerated mothers who are demographically similar to mothers incarcerated
in jails, state prisons, and federal prisons (Wildeman and Turney, 2014). It also represents a
missed opportunity on the policy side, as identifying effect heterogeneity in the consequences
of maternal incarceration also could provide guidance about which types of maternal
incarceration policies might harm children, benefit children, or be inconsequential for
children.
The results suggest that the effects of maternal incarceration on wellbeing in middle
childhood are strikingly heterogeneous. For three of the four measures considered (caregiver-
reported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing problem behav-
iors, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency), maternal incarceration is damaging
for children of mothers unlikely to experience incarceration. The effects of maternal in-
carceration, for these children, are pronounced, corresponding to between two fifths and
three fifths of a standard deviation difference from their counterparts without incarcerated
mothers. But maternal incarceration exerts no independent effect on children of mothers
more likely to experience incarceration. By providing the first broadly representative quan-
titative evidence documenting heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on children,
this study helps rectify divergent findings about the average effects of maternal incarcer-
ation (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2013; Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Huebner and Gustafson,
2007; Wildeman and Turney, 2014), advances our understanding about how the conse-
quences of incarceration may vary across social contexts, and provides novel insights for
policy makers.
Understanding Heterogeneity in the Effects of Maternal Incarceration
The inattention of prior quantitative research to systematically documenting the hetero-
geneous effects of maternal incarceration on child wellbeing is an unfortunate oversight
Volume 14 r Issue 1 127
Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
for at least three reasons. First, qualitative research has suggested that the effects of mater-
nal incarceration are not identical (or even similar) for all children. Second, quantitative
research, which has relied on samples that are varied in the proportion of children who
experience maternal incarceration (as well as in the rigor of statistical methods employed
and the extensiveness of controls included), has come to conflicting conclusions regarding
the average effects of maternal incarceration. Third, many critical of research on the inter-
generational consequences of parental incarceration have maintained that negative effects
of parental incarceration are, at best, implausible for the most destructive parents (e.g.,
Giordano, 2010; Johnston, 2006; Sampson, 2011).
We discuss these three points in the following discussion.
Heterogeneity in Qualitative Research
First, and most importantly, it is important to document systematically the heteroge-
neous effects of maternal incarceration on children because qualitative research consistently
has suggested considerable variability in effects (Arditti, 2012a; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic
et al., 2012). For example, several in-depth qualitative examinations have provided evidence
that maternal incarceration--through some combination of parental absence, emotional
trauma, caregiver instability, or stigma--is harmful to children (Arditti, 2012a; Siegel, 2011;
Turanovic et al., 2012). Jane Siegel's interviews with children of imprisoned mothers pro-
vided two especially compelling examples of the psychological toll that maternal incarcera-
tion can take on children:
I miss her so much. I just want her to be home already. It's really bad `cause
when things happen, I want to tell her about it and I really can't because she's
not here and I really want her to really be here. I wanted her to be here for my
fifteenth birthday. I want her to be here when I graduate. I want her to be here
for my prom. I want her to be here for so many things, but she might not be
here and I hate that. I want her to be here so bad. I love my mother. She is a
very good mother. She's awesome. (Valencia, in Siegel, 2011: 138)
Most people's fathers be in since they was babies, for killing somebody or doing
this or selling drugs. So it's not a big deal. So when your mother be in prison
. . . it's even worse, period, than a father. Because most of the time a father
don't never take part in the kid's life anyway. (Naja, in Siegel, 2011: 149).
Yet, and contradictory to evidence suggesting deleterious consequences of maternal
incarceration, qualitative research has found that maternal incarceration is a constructive
experience for some children and, more broadly, for family functioning. This possibility was
convincingly present in two qualitative studies (Siegel, 2011; Turanovic et al., 2012). For
example, Turanovic and colleagues (2012) found that, on balance, maternal incarceration
is a positive experience for more than one fourth of children's caregivers. Maybe the most
128 Criminology & Public Policy
Turney and Wildeman
poignant example of the beneficial effects of maternal incarceration comes from Eddy, a
father of three:
You know what happens to a father when a mother goes to jail? In my case,
it's the best thing that ever happened to me and my kids. Best thing that ever
happened for us if you ask me. She didn't like the split between us so she would
pop my tires, break my windows, so I went to the courts a couple of times
and this time they just really put their foot down and she was sent to state,
sentenced a year and a half. She cost me thousands of dollars, popping my tires
and just chaos. We were hotel hopping. We didn't have a choice. I had to move
three times because of Erica coming to my house being loud. One apartment
complex put me out because she was yelling outside of my door, and I had
a restraining order but they said it didn't matter, it was some kind of policed
apartment complex, any problems and you're out of there. (Turanovic et al.,
2012: 938Â­939)
In addition to providing evidence of positive and negative effects, some qualitative
research has indicated that maternal incarceration is simply inconsequential for children.
Maternal incarceration could be inconsequential for several reasons. First, some mothers
are entirely absent from children's lives prior to incarceration, and in these cases, absence
via incarceration likely has no direct effect (e.g., Turanovic et al., 2012: 935). Additionally,
incarcerated mothers are an extremely disadvantaged group--they disproportionately report
trauma, substance abuse, housing instability, and mental illness--and it could be these
disadvantages, and not maternal incarceration itself, that explain any differences between
these children and their counterparts (e.g., Giordano, 2010). In other words, these children
would likely experience disadvantages regardless of maternal incarceration (e.g., Siegel,
2011; Turanovic et al., 2012). Finally, it is possible that the positive and negative effects of
maternal incarceration roughly cancel each other out and, accordingly, lead to average null
effects on children (e.g., Giordano, 2010: 147Â­150; also see Turney, 2014a).
Heterogeneity in Quantitative Research
A second reason to consider the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on child
wellbeing is that quantitative research, even when only considering the studies that have
used broadly representative data, has documented incredibly disparate average effects.1
Consider three examples that used large, population-based samples: Hagan and Foster's
(2012b; also see Foster and Hagan, 2013) analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of
1. However, some research has suggested that individual-level characteristics of the mother can moderate
the link between maternal incarceration and child wellbeing (e.g., Hanlon, Blatchley, et al., 2005; Hanlon,
O'Grady, Bennett-Sears, and Callaman, 2005; Poehlmann, 2005; Poehlmann, Schlafer, Maes, and
Hanneman, 2008).

Adolescent Health (Add Health), Huebner and Gustafson's (2007) analysis of children born
to members of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), and Wildeman
and Turney's (2014) analysis of the FFCWB. Across these three studies, the proportion
of children who experienced maternal incarceration--and, correspondingly, the level of
selection into maternal incarceration--was dramatically different. Approximately 1% of
children in the Add Health study experienced maternal incarceration any time between
birth and 18 years of age (Hagan and Foster, 2012b: 48), approximately 2% of children in
the NLSY79 study experienced maternal incarceration between birth and 18Â­24 years of age
(Huebner and Gustafson, 2007: 286), and approximately 9% of children in the FFCWB
study experienced maternal incarceration between birth and 9 years of age (Wildeman and
Turney, 2014).
The dramatic differences between the two studies that used the Add Health and
NLSY79 (Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Huebner and Gustafson, 2007) and the one study
that used the FFCWB (Wildeman and Turney, 2014) could have resulted from differential
selection into incarceration across the samples. The FFCWB study included a population-
based sample of children born to mostly unmarried (and, therefore, mostly disadvantaged)
mothers around the turn of the millennium. Because of their disadvantage and because of
the relatively high incarceration rates, compared with rates in even slightly earlier historical
periods, maternal incarceration is a more normative experience among these children than
among children in the other two samples. Incarcerated mothers in this study, compared with
those in the other two studies, are more similar to mothers who are not incarcerated. This
differential selection could explain why two of the three studies found large and statistically
significant negative average effects of maternal incarceration (Hagan and Foster, 2012b;
Huebner and Gustafson, 2007) and one study found statistically nonsignificant average
effects (Wildeman and Turney, 2014). Under significant heterogeneity by the propensity
for incarceration, which these studies did not consider, such marked variations in the
probability of experiencing maternal incarceration could easily lead to the divergent average
effects across these studies (although, for research on racial and ethnic differences in the
effects of maternal incarceration on caregiver-reported behavioral problems, see Wildeman
and Turney, 2014). It could be that children drawn from samples in which maternal
incarceration is highly unlikely experience deleterious consequences, and children drawn
from samples where maternal incarceration is more common experience beneficial or null
consequences. Yet, because no broadly representative quantitative research has considered
both the average effects of maternal incarceration and the effects by the propensity for
experiencing maternal incarceration, it is impossible to explain these divergent findings.2
2. Of course, variation across samples in the probability of experiencing maternal incarceration is not the
only potential explanation for divergent findings across studies. Other features--sampling strategies,
modeling strategies, control variables, ages of children, and outcomes--also could explain these
divergent findings.

Critiques of Research on Consequences of Incarceration
A final--and different--reason why it is important to document the heterogeneous effects of
maternal incarceration relates to research on the consequences of incarceration more broadly,
especially as it relates to family life. Two ideas have been dominant among scholars most
critical of this research (e.g., Giordano, 2010; Johnston, 2006; Sampson, 2011). The first
idea is that selection into incarceration--via earlier criminal justice contact, mental illness,
or substance abuse--rather than incarceration itself drives the negative effects of parental
incarceration on child wellbeing. The second, and related, idea is that some incarcerated
parents engage in behaviors so damaging to family life that, accordingly, their absence may
actually be beneficial for their children. The second concern is directly relevant to the
mothers with a high probability of experiencing incarceration.
A myopic focus on the average effects of maternal incarceration makes it, to a degree,
impossible for scholars--especially those who know that characteristics such as emotional
instability, severe substance abuse, or child neglect are detrimental to children--to find
research that has shown negative effects of maternal incarceration credible (absent also having
shown that maternal incarceration does not help--or at least does not harm--the children
of mothers most likely to be incarcerated). Considering effect heterogeneity--by mothers'
propensity for experiencing incarceration--thus has the potential to provide a "reality check"
on the prevailing literature considering the average effects of maternal incarceration. Several
examinations of the effects of paternal incarceration successfully considered variation in
effects--although not in the propensity score matching framework--and they found that
the detrimental effects of paternal incarceration are muted when the father was nonresident
prior to his incarceration (Geller et al., 2012) and virtually nonexistent when the father had
engaged in domestic violence (Wildeman, 2010).
Current Study
In this study, we use data from the FFCWB to examine how the effect of maternal incar-
ceration varies across mothers' propensities for experiencing incarceration. This propensity
score matching approach--which matches incarcerated mothers with mothers who are
similar across a distribution of covariates except for their incarceration experience--allows
us to consider an array of social contexts that shape children's lives prior to incarceration.
This approach also is especially valuable given the vast differences between incarcerated
and not incarcerated mothers. We proceed under the ignorability assumption, which is the
assumption that there are no unobserved confounders (Morgan and Harding, 2006), but
our analyses also investigate the extent to which unobserved selection into incarceration
exists and, hence, provide insight into the degree to which the results could violate this
assumption and find statistically significant effects.
Our examination of the relationship between maternal incarceration and child wellbe-
ing has at least three key strengths. First, we provide insight into the heterogeneous effects
of maternal incarceration by using data and methods that allow us to adjust extensively for
Volume 14 r Issue 1 131
Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
selection into incarceration. In so doing, we contribute to research on the consequences
of incarceration for families (e.g., Comfort, 2008; Turney, 2014b; Turney, Schnittker, and
Wildeman, 2012; Turney and Wildeman, 2013) and to research on heterogeneous treat-
ment effects (e.g., Brand and Xie, 2010). Second, by considering a range of outcomes in
middle childhood that are linked to later life-course outcomes, we provide broad insight into
how maternal incarceration will affect children throughout their life course (Caspi, Bem,
and Elder, 1989; Knoester, 2003; Loeber, Farrington, and Petechuk, 2013; McLeod and
Kaiser, 2004). Finally, by adding nuance to research on the consequences of imprisonment
by looking for both statistically significant and nonsignificant effects, we contribute to a
shift in this research program (e.g., Turney and Wildeman, 2013).
Method
Data
We use longitudinal data from the FFCWB, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children born
between 1998 and 2000 (Reichman, Teitler, Garfinkel, and McLanahan, 2001). Baseline in-
person interviews with both mothers and fathers occurred nearly immediately after the focal
child's birth. Parents were interviewed by telephone when their children were approximately
1, 3, 5, and 9 years old, and at the latter three waves, some families also participated in an
in-home interview. Baseline response rates were 86% for mothers and 78% for fathers. Of
those who participated in the baseline interview, 91%, 89%, 88%, and 76% of children
had at least one parent (and often both parents) participate in the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year
telephone interviews, respectively. Approximately 69% of children had a caregiver (most
often a mother) complete the 9-year in-home interview.
In constructing the analytic sample, we dropped the 1,507 observations without a
complete 9-year in-home interview, as the dependent variables are measured during this
interview, and the additional 194 observations missing data on any of the four dependent
variables. The analytic sample, then, includes 3,197 observations.3 Because families with
a complete 9-year in-home interview are likely different from those without a complete
9-year in-home interview, and this attrition might have implications for the results, we
compare the baseline sample and the analytic sample in Table A1. This table shows there are
some statistically significant, although small, observed differences between the baseline and
analytic samples. Mothers in the analytic sample, compared with mothers in the baseline
sample, are more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, less likely to be foreign-born, and are
more likely to have younger mothers. In the analytic sample, mothers are more likely to be
employed and fathers are less likely to be employed. Fathers have higher impulsivity and

variables.

are more likely to have been previously incarcerated. We return to the implications of these
differences in the discussion.
We do not impute the dependent variable but preserve missing covariate data with
multiple imputation (Allison, 2001). Prior to imputation, nearly all covariates are missing
fewer than 10% of observations in the analytic sample. Exceptions include mother's par-
enting stress, father's employment, and father's impulsivity, which are missing 17%, 26%,
and 35% of observations, respectively.
Measures
Outcome variables. We examine four indicators of child wellbeing: caregiver-reported
internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing problem behaviors,
PPVT-III scores, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency. To begin with, during the
in-home 9-year interview, children's caregivers (mothers, in 93% of cases in the analytic
sample) were asked to respond to a series of questions from the Child Behavior Checklist,
a commonly used measure of children's behavior (Achenbach, 1992). Caregivers were
asked to report how often their children engaged in an array of behaviors (0 = not
true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true). Internalizing
problem behaviors are measured by averaging responses to 32 questions ( = .88), and
externalizing problem behaviors are measured by averaging responses to 34 questions
( = .91). Additionally, the PPVT-III, administered during the in-home 9-year interview,
measures children's age-standardized verbal ability. Interviewers read words to children,
who had to identify a picture (among a set of four pictures) corresponding to the word
(Dunn and Dunn, 1997). Finally, early juvenile delinquency is measured by children's
self-reports about participating in 17 delinquent activities from the "Things that You Have
Done" scale (Maumary-Gremaud, 2000; also see Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989).
The measure of delinquency is a sum of these items (Thornberry and Krohn, 2002).4 For
consistency across outcomes and ease of interpretation, we standardize all four dependent
variables (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1).5
4. Children were asked to report whether they had ever done the following 17 activities: (a) purposely
damaged or destroyed property that was not yours; (b) taken or stolen something that did not belong
to you from another person or from a store; (c) taken some money at home that did not belong to you,
like from your mother's purse or from your parents' dresser; (d) cheated on a school test; (e) had a fist
fight with another person; (f) hurt an animal on purpose; (g) gone into somebody's garden, backyard,
house, or garage when you were not supposed to be there; (h) run away from home; (i) skipped school
without an excuse; (j) secretly taken a sip of wine, beer, or liquor; (k) smoked marijuana, grass pot, or
weed; (l) smoked a cigarette or used tobacco; (m) been suspended or expelled from school; (n) written
things or sprayed paint on walls or sidewalks or cars; (o) purposely set fire to a building, a car, or other
property or tried to do so; (p) avoided paying for things such as movies, bus or subway rides, or food; or
(q) thrown rocks or bottles at people or cars. Note that some of these activities might be prosocial and
others may lead to future deviant behavior (e.g., Foster, Nagin, Hagan, Angold, and Costello, 2010).
5. The dependent variables have low (e.g., r for internalizing problem behaviors and PPVT-III scores =
Â­0.08) to high correlations (e.g., r for internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors = 0.66).

Explanatory variable. A dummy variable indicates maternal incarceration between the 1-
and 9-year interviews. Mothers are considered to experience incarceration if the interviews
provide direct or indirect evidence of incarceration. Direct evidence means that either the
mother or father reports, at the 3-, 5-, or 9-year interviews, that the mother is currently
incarcerated or has been incarcerated since the previous interview. Indirect evidence means
that information about maternal incarceration emerged at other points during the mother's,
father's, or caregiver's interviews (e.g., a report that the child stopped living with the
mother because she was incarcerated), instead of in response to a direct question. Indirect
evidence of maternal incarceration also is ascertained when the mother and father reports,
at the 1-year survey, that the mother was never incarcerated and that the mother or father
subsequently reports she was ever incarcerated. Therefore, both direct and indirect evidence
of incarceration indicates the mother was incarcerated in the child's lifetime. Approximately
9% of mothers experienced incarceration.
Control variables. We use mother, father, and child characteristics, including a host of
characteristics associated with selection into incarceration, to generate propensity scores
for maternal incarceration. Importantly, to ensure temporal ordering between the control
variables and maternal incarceration, we measure all control variables at the baseline or 1-
year survey and, thus, prior to maternal incarceration. The one exception includes maternal
impulsivity, described below, which was only ascertained at the 5-year interview but is
considered a stable, time-invariant characteristic (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990).
Demographic characteristics include dummy variables that indicate mother's and
father's race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other
race), mother's immigrant status, mother's age, and mother's family structure at 15 years
of age (1 = lived with both biological parents and 0 = did not live with both biological
parents). Socioeconomic factors include mother's and father's educational attainment (less
than high school, high-school diploma or GED, postsecondary education), a dummy
variable indicating the mother's household income is below the poverty line, a continuous
measure of material hardship (e.g., received free food or meals in the past year, evicted
from home or apartment for not paying the rent or mortgage), and dummy variables
indicating the mother and father were employed in the last week. Family characteristics
include a dummy variable indicating whether a grandmother lives in the child's household,
the parents' relationship status (married, cohabiting, nonresidential romantic relationship,
or separated), a continuous variable indicating mother-reported relationship quality with
the father (1 = poor to 5 = excellent), and a continuous variable indicating the number of
children in the mother's household. The analyses also control for mother's major depression
(measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument-Short Form; Kessler,
Andrews, Mroczek, Ustun, and Wittchen, 1998) and mother's parenting stress (e.g., I feel
trapped by my responsibilities as a parent, taking care of my child is much more work
than pleasure;  = .60). Three child characteristics include gender, low birth weight, and
134 Criminology & Public Policy
Turney and Wildeman
a continuous measure of children's temperament, with higher scores indicating greater
emotionality and shyness ( = .52; Buss and Plomin, 1984).
Finally, in generating the propensity score, we control for a host of mother's and
father's characteristics that could confound the relationship between maternal incarceration
and child wellbeing. Dummy variables indicate the mother smoked during pregnancy
and the mother used drugs or drank alcohol during pregnancy, both of which might be
related to adverse birth outcomes. Dummy variables indicate the following: The mother
has a substance abuse problem (measured by an affirmative response to at least one of the
following at the 1-year interview: since the child was born, drinking or using drugs interfered
with day-to-day management; since the child was born, drinking or use drugs interfered
with personal relationships; and sought help or been treated for drug or alcohol problems
since the child was born); the father has a substance abuse problem (measured similarly as
mother's substance abuse problem but includes both mother's and father's reports of the
father's substance abuse problem at the baseline and 1-year interviews); the father engaged
in domestic violence; the mother was previously incarcerated (between the baseline and
1-year interviews); and the father was previously incarcerated (at or prior to the 1-year
interview, including before baseline). Mother's and father's impulsivity were measured with
a continuous variable measured by questions such as "I will often say whatever comes into
my head without thinking" and "often I don't think enough before I act" ( = .86 for
mothers and .84 for fathers; Dickman, 1990). Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1.
Analytic Strategy
The first analytic stage estimates the average effects of maternal incarceration on
child wellbeing. Although prior research has considered the average effects of maternal

present these estimates to (a) show that our approach (which is similar, but not identical, to
previous research) provides results consistent with previous research and (b) provide context
for interpreting the results demonstrating heterogeneous effects. To estimate the average
effects, we first estimate a logistic regression model to generate a propensity score for each
observation in each of the 20 imputed data sets. The propensity score, which is essentially
a risk factor for experiencing the treatment, maternal incarceration, ranges from 0 to 1.
We use all control variables, which prior research has shown to be associated with either
incarceration and/or child wellbeing, to generate the propensity score. Next, we ensure that
covariates in the treatment and control groups are statistically indistinguishable from one
another. The two groups differ only in their experience of the treatment. We then use kernel
matching, which matches all treatment observations to control observations by weight-
ing control observations by their distance from treatment cases (kernel = Epanechnikov;
bandwidth = 0.06). Ordinary least-squares (OLS) models then estimate internalizing
problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, PPVT-III scores, and early juvenile

delinquency on matched samples. We average the results across the 20 imputed data sets
(Allison, 2001; Rubin, 1987).
The second analytic stage, and the key part of our analytic strategy, estimates the
heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on child wellbeing. We use multilevel
propensity score models to explore the possibility that some children are more vulnerable to
the effects of maternal incarceration than other children. First, we group observations into
three stratum based on their propensity score {p = [.00, .05), p = [.05, .10), p = [.10, .30)}.
These strata allow for natural cutpoints of the propensity scores and for similar numbers of
observations in each stratum (Xie, Brand, and Jann, 2012; also see Rosenbaum and Rubin,
1984). Following Xie et al.'s (2012: 329) recommendation, we ensure that each stratum
includes at least 20 treatment observations and 20 control observations. Observations in
the first stratum have the lowest likelihood of maternal incarceration, and those in the
third stratum have the highest likelihood of maternal incarceration. Importantly, within
each stratum, we restrict the analyses to regions of common support and ensure that there
are no statistically significant differences in the control variables between the treatment
and control groups. For example, in stratum 1, the treatment and control groups have a
similar distribution of covariates and vary only by maternal incarceration. Including all
variables used to generate the propensity score in the models estimating average effects
was not possible, as their inclusion precluded the within-stratum balance requirement of
this propensity score matching approach (see Table A2 for the means across treatment and
control groups of variables used in the heterogeneous treatment effect models).
Volume 14 r Issue 1 137
Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
We then estimate multilevel models. Level 1 estimates the effects of maternal incarcer-
ation on child wellbeing in each stratum, and Level 2 estimates the trend in the variation of
effects by propensity score stratum. Again, all outcomes are estimated with OLS regression
models. Because these multilevel models cannot be estimated with multiply imputed data,
these models use only one imputed data set. The magnitude and statistical significance of
the point estimates, however, remain substantively similar in robustness checks that use
different single imputed data sets.
Although propensity score matching is a strategic method for estimating the
effects of maternal incarceration, because it approximates an experimental design and en-
sures the treatment and control groups differ only in their experience of the treatment, this
method only accounts for observed characteristics. We proceed under the assumption that
no unobserved characteristics could render any observed effects of maternal incarceration
statistically nonsignificant (the ignorability assumption, as discussed previously), and it is
possible that unobserved characteristics--such as criminal activity or child maltreatment--
exist. Therefore, both the estimates of average and heterogeneous effects cannot rule out
the possibility that selection into incarceration rather than incarceration itself drives any
observed association (Morgan and Harding, 2006). We conduct sensitivity analyses to con-
sider this possibility more fully and return to this point in the discussion. All analyses were
conducted with Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX) (also see Becker and Caliendo, 2007;
Jann, Brand, and Xie, 2007).
Results
Estimating the Average Effects of Maternal Incarceration on Child Wellbeing
Table 2 presents estimates of the effect of maternal incarceration on four measures of
child wellbeing: internalizing problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, PPVT-
III scores, and early juvenile delinquency. The unmatched differences are presented in the
first column. These estimates suggest that children with incarcerated mothers, compared
with their counterparts, have greater internalizing behaviors (b = 0.105, p < .10), greater
externalizing behaviors (b = 0.179, p < .01), lower PPVT-III scores (b = Â­0.130, p < .05),
and more early juvenile delinquency (b = 0.279, p < .001).
The matched differences, which match treatment observations to control observations
via kernel matching, are presented in the next column. These matched differences show
that, between the treatment and control groups, no substantively or statistically significant
differences were found in internalizing problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors,
PPVT-III scores, and early juvenile delinquency. Therefore, consistent with other research
using these data that has considered the average effects (see Wildeman and Turney, 2014,
which employed propensity score matching to estimate 21 caregiver- and teacher-reported
problem behaviors), the results show that the unmatched differences likely result from social
selection forces.

Estimating the Heterogeneous Effects of Maternal Incarceration on Child Wellbeing
The previous estimates, which documented no robust average effect of maternal incarcer-
ation on child wellbeing, assumed that the effect of maternal incarceration is similar for
all children. However, it is possible that the effects are heterogeneous, meaning that some
children might suffer substantial harm and that others might considerably benefit from ma-
ternal incarceration. We next consider this possibility. We generate three propensity score
strata, each of which include mothers in the treatment group and mothers in the control
group that have a similar distribution of covariates.
Table 3 shows that mothers from the first stratum (those with the lowest propensity,
or risk, for incarceration, with no more than a 5% risk) are more advantaged than mothers
in the second stratum (those with a 5% to 10% risk of incarceration) and, especially, third
stratum (those with a 10% to 30% risk of incarceration). For example, in stratum 1, just
more than one third (36%) of mothers were non-Hispanic Black, compared with 56%
in stratum 2 and stratum 3. Additionally, compared with their counterparts, mothers in
stratum 1 are likely to have postsecondary education (54% compared with 42% in stratum
2 and 11% in stratum 3), are unlikely to have household incomes below the poverty line
(27% compared with 36% in stratum 2 and 62% in stratum 3), are likely to be married to
the focal child's father (53% compared with 27% in stratum 2 and 10% in stratum 3), and
are unlikely to report depression (6% compared with 13% in stratum 2 and 28% in stratum
3). Furthermore, among mothers in stratum 1, only 4% shared a child with a previously

Table 4 presents results from multilevel models estimating the heterogeneous effects of
maternal incarceration. Recall that higher values indicate less favorable outcomes for inter-
nalizing problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, and early juvenile delinquency
and more favorable behaviors for PPVT scores. Turning first to estimates of internalizing
problem behaviors, the Level 1 coefficients show that the effect of maternal incarceration
varies across the three strata. Maternal incarceration is associated with one half of a standard
deviation increase in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum 1 (p < .01), a small and
statistically nonsignificant increase in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum 2, and a
small and statistically nonsignificant decrease in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum
3. The Level 2 slope demonstrates that, for each unit change in stratum, there is a 0.235
standard deviation decrease in the effect of maternal incarceration (p < .05). Figure 1a
provides a graphical depiction.
The results are nearly identical for externalizing problem behaviors and early juvenile
delinquency. The Level 1 coefficients show that the effects of maternal incarceration are
concentrated among individuals only in stratum 1 (for externalizing problem behaviors)
and in both strata 1 and 2 (for early juvenile delinquency). The Level 2 coefficient shows
that these between-strata differences are statistically significant. For example, maternal

incarceration is associated with about a three fifths of a standard deviation increase in exter-
nalizing problem behaviors in stratum 1 (p < .01), a small and statistically nonsignificant
increase in externalizing problems behaviors in stratum 2, and a small and statistically
nonsignificant decrease in problem behaviors in stratum 3. The Level 2 slope shows, for
each unit change in stratum, a 0.298 standard deviation decrease in externalizing problem
behaviors (p < .01) and a 0.251 standard deviation decrease in early juvenile delinquency
(p < .01). Figures 1b and 1c provide graphical depictions.
The estimates for PPVT-III scores follow a similar pattern, with the largest coefficient
for children of mothers least likely to be incarcerated and the smallest coefficient for
children of mothers most likely to be incarcerated. But the between-stratum differences are
not statistically significant, and therefore, we do not provide a graphical depiction of this
relationship. See Appendix A for additional analyses that interrogate the robustness of these
findings.
Discussion
Results Summary
Children of incarcerated mothers represent a growing and vulnerable population, and ac-
cordingly, a burgeoning literature has considered how maternal incarceration--above and
beyond other disadvantages that are correlated with maternal incarceration--affects the
wellbeing of children. But quantitative research, at least broadly representative quantitative
research, has provided evidence of both deleterious (e.g., Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Hueb-
ner and Gustafson, 2007) and null (e.g., Wildeman and Turney, 2014) average effects, and
qualitative research has documented that maternal incarceration may be deleterious, ben-
eficial, or inconsequential (e.g., Arditti, 2012a; Giordano, 2010; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic
et al., 2012). Therefore, in this article, we attempt to reconcile these findings by considering
the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on children.
We use data from the FFCWB--a data source that includes incarcerated mothers
demographically similar to mothers incarcerated in jails, state prisons, and federal prisons
(Wildeman and Turney, 2014)--and a series of propensity score matching models to esti-
mate the effects of maternal incarceration on wellbeing among 9-year-old children, finding
significant evidence of effect heterogeneity; the children least likely to experience this event
suffer deleterious consequences, and the children most likely to experience this event suffer
no statistically significant responses. One explanation for the statistically nonsignificant
findings among children most likely to experience maternal incarceration, a disadvantaged
group of children prior to maternal incarceration, could be that children stop accumulating
adverse consequences once they reach a certain point of saturation (Hannon, 2003). A
related explanation could be that maternal incarceration offers relief from other stressors
such as domestic violence or economic deprivation (Wheaton, 1990). A final possibility is
that women who are most likely to experience incarceration are probably also most likely
to be lost to attrition. It is possible that the analytic sample excludes some mothers with a
Volume 14 r Issue 1 143
Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
high propensity for experiencing incarceration and, therefore, makes it difficult to find any
statistically significant (positive) effects.
The evidence of heterogeneous effects complements both qualitative and quantitative
research on maternal incarceration and, more broadly, contributes theoretically to research
on the consequences of incarceration. Consistent with the nuanced qualitative research
on maternal incarceration (Arditti, 2012a; Giordano, 2010; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic et al.,
2012), we show that maternal incarceration can harm some children and have no discernible
effect on others. Importantly, we find no statistically significant positive effects of maternal
incarceration that often have been described in the qualitative literature (e.g., Turanovic
et al., 2012). This could be because these positive effects are not driven by characteristics
associated with selection into incarceration. Alternatively, it could be that even the mothers
with the highest propensities for incarceration in our sample (those with a 10% to 30%
risk) were still not above a threshold that would produce consistently beneficial effects of
incarceration. Although the coefficients for mothers with the highest propensities are not
statistically significant, in the case of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors,
the direction of the coefficients suggests positive effects, and it is likely that some positive
effects are counterbalanced by negative effects (Turney, 2014a; for research on paternal
absence more generally, see Jaffee, Moffitt, Caspi, and Taylor, 2003). Indeed, as there are
likely individual instances where maternal incarceration improves child wellbeing, future
research should continue to test for positive effects of maternal incarceration and should
consider that these positive effects could be driven by something other than the mother's
propensity for incarceration. More generally, given that considering only the average effects
of maternal incarceration masks considerable heterogeneity, both research and public policy
surrounding the consequences of maternal incarceration should carefully consider treatment
heterogeneity.
Relatedly, the results regarding effect heterogeneity bring together the three most rig-
orous, broadly representative analyses of the effects of maternal incarceration on children.
For instance, in Hagan and Foster's (2012b) analysis of the Add Health data and Huebner
and Gustafson's (2007) analysis of the NLSY79 data, approximately 1% and 2% of mothers
were incarcerated, respectively. These analyses documented large, statistically significant
negative effects of maternal incarceration, which is precisely in line with our findings for
children of mothers least likely to be incarcerated (e.g., those with a propensity below 5%).
Additionally, in Wildeman and Turney's (2014) analysis of the FFCWB data, where ap-
proximately 9% of mothers were incarcerated, they found statistically nonsignificant effects
for 19 of the 21 outcomes considered. This result is consistent with what we find here
for children of mothers with relatively high propensities for experiencing incarceration.
Furthermore, although Wildeman and Turney (2014) did not consider variation by the
propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration, they did consider race and ethnic dif-
ferences in the relationship between maternal incarceration and caregiver-reported problem
behaviors, finding evidence that maternal incarceration decreases problem behaviors among
144 Criminology & Public Policy
Turney and Wildeman
White children. Thus, seemingly divergent findings across prior research could be driven
by the populations they represent, not by differences in statistical methods, children's ages,
or outcomes.
More generally, these findings provide confidence that the effects--positive, negative, or
null--of maternal incarceration across studies reflect the social reality of children's lives. This
observation is especially true in conjunction with studies that found null effects of maternal
incarceration in disadvantaged samples (e.g., Wildeman and Turney, 2014), studies that
found that theoretically relevant moderators condition the effects of parental incarceration
on children (e.g., Dallaire et al., 2014; Hanlon et al., 2005a, 2005b; Poehlmann, 2005),
and studies that suggested heterogeneity in the effects of incarceration on family life more
broadly (Turney and Wildeman, 2013).
Limitations
Although the analyses do reconcile much prior research on this topic and contribute the-
oretically to broader research on the effects of incarceration, limitations exist. Importantly,
not all families who participated in the baseline sample remained in the study at the 9-year
survey, which was when the outcome variables were measured. Although descriptive analyses
show small observed differences between the baseline and analytic samples, it is possible
that there are additional unobserved differences between those who did and did not remain
in the study. We suspect that those who do not remain in the study are more disadvantaged
in their unobservable characteristics and, therefore, are more likely to be families with a
high propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration. If we could retain these families,
it is possible that maternal incarceration would have a protective effect on children with a
high propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration.
Additionally, the propensity score matching models proceed under the ignorability
assumption, which is the assumption that unobserved characteristics are not excluded when
balancing across treatment and control groups (Morgan and Harding, 2006). Unmeasured
characteristics--such as heritability or mothers' criminal history--could confound our
results. The analyses, however, provide evidence that this is not a major concern. For one,
the models estimating average effects document null effects. Also, the models estimating
heterogeneous effects show that the negative statistically significant effects are concentrated
among children of the least disadvantaged mothers. Indeed, if unobserved heterogeneity
produced biased results, then we would likely find statistically significant negative effects
among children of the most disadvantaged mothers. The Rosenbaum bounds also provide
assurance that our results--the negative effects of maternal incarceration on children of the
least disadvantaged mothers--are likely not unduly biased by omitted variables driving both
maternal incarceration and poor child outcomes. However, absent a randomized control
trial, we cannot undoubtedly rule out unmeasured heterogeneity, and therefore, our policy
suggestions are contingent on being replicated with experimental data. Unlike research on
the effects of paternal incarceration, where it is difficult to link disadvantaged men to their
Volume 14 r Issue 1 145
Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
children through administrative records, linking disadvantaged mothers to their children is
more straightforward and future research should undertake these analyses.
Other limitations, common among studies that examine the effects of maternal in-
carceration, exist. For one, the measure of maternal incarceration is crude. We cannot
differentiate children of mothers who experienced short incarceration stays from those who
experienced lengthy ones. We also cannot distinguish between prison or jail incarceration,
have no data about the distance between the incarcerated mother and her child, and lack
information on earlier stages of criminal justice contact (e.g., arrest) or family circumstances
immediately prior to maternal incarceration, all of which could influence child wellbeing
(Dallaire et al., 2014; Sampson, 2014). Also, too few mothers were incarcerated at each
wave to consider how the timing or chronicity of maternal incarceration may affect child
wellbeing. Future studies of child wellbeing, especially those with nationally representative
and population-based samples, should collect information about these details to facilitate
a more nuanced understanding of the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration and
the mechanisms underlying these effects.
Implications for Public Policy and Conclusions
The implications of these results for public policy are difficult to disentangle, especially
because the analytic strategy lacks a true experimental design, and we thus hope this article
launches both additional research on the effects of maternal incarceration on children and
a conversation about how public policy could minimize the consequences of maternal
incarceration for children.
First, it is important to discuss the public policy implications of our null findings.
We find that, for children of mothers more likely to experience incarceration (those in
stratum 2 and stratum 3), maternal incarceration is not independently associated with
deleterious outcomes in children, which is in line with findings from other research that has
considered the average effects of incarceration with these data (Wildeman and Turney, 2014).
Importantly, children of mothers with a high propensity for experiencing incarceration are
an extremely disadvantaged group, and it is likely that the relative influence of these
other disadvantages--compared with maternal incarceration--drive unfavorable outcomes
for these children. Therefore, although reducing maternal incarceration could do little to
benefit these children, public policy might instead focus on issues that disproportionately
affect children of mothers with a high likelihood of incarceration, such as alleviating poverty
or increasing access to substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, as it is possible that these
children simply learn how to cope with maternal incarceration, public policy efforts could
be directed toward social service programs that help children and families adapt to maternal
incarceration, perhaps by striving to increase cooperation and support among children's
caregivers, additional family members, and teachers.
Next, we focus our public policy discussion on the group of children who, in our
analyses, suffer the most substantial consequences of maternal incarceration: children of
146 Criminology & Public Policy
Turney and Wildeman
mothers who are unlikely to experience incarceration (those with a 0% to 5% risk). For
children of mothers unlikely to experience incarceration, the negative consequences of
maternal incarceration could be driven by at least three factors, all of which may be
operating simultaneously and all of which potentially call for different policy interventions:
(a) jail incarceration as opposed to prison incarceration, (b) incarceration for a crime that
did minimal--or no--harm to their children, and (c) inadequate family supports for coping
with maternal incarceration. We consider each of these points in the following paragraphs.
For one, it is possible that the negative effects of maternal incarceration among children
of mothers unlikely to experience incarceration are driven by the conditions of confinement
(specifically, jail incarceration compared with prison incarceration). It is possible that because
mothers with a low propensity for incarceration are more likely than their counterparts with
a higher propensity for incarceration to be experiencing incarceration for the first time, they
may be more likely to be incarcerated in jails than prisons. Because jails are usually located
closer to pre-incarceration residences than prisons, they facilitate easier visitation that could
be traumatic for either the mother or the child. Relatedly, jail stays are generally shorter
than prison stays, which means that children of mothers incarcerated in jail experience more
family instability than children of mothers incarcerated in prison. Unfortunately, these data,
like most other data on maternal incarceration, do not allow us to differentiate between
jail and prison incarceration (or other types of incarceration experiences, as discussed at
length previously). This, of course, makes it difficult to know what is driving the effects,
and calls both for heavier reliance on qualitative research and for better information on
the conditions of confinement. We do not have information about the conditions of
confinement experienced by mothers with a low propensity for incarceration (whose children
respond poorly to their incarceration) or how those conditions of confinement differ from
those of mothers with a higher propensity for incarceration (whose children show no effects).
As we lack information on the conditions of confinement, this public policy conversation
will be best had after research with more information on these features of incarceration has
been conducted.
A second possibility is that mothers with a low propensity to experience incarceration
were disproportionately committing crimes that did little harm to their children prior to
their incarceration--and, by extension, could have had relatively few broader consequences
for society prior to their incarceration. If this assumption is true, then this--in conjunction
with our findings about the deleterious effects on children of these mothers--leads to public
policy suggestions that are relatively easy to follow: Rely on criminal justice interventions
other than incarceration for low-level offenses, with an emphasis on decriminalizing pos-
session of marijuana and other petty offenses (especially minor public order offenses). Yet
the difficulty is that the data do not allow us to know whether the mothers with a low
propensity for incarceration are those incarcerated for the least serious crimes, although this
assumption is plausible.

Research Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing
A third possibility is that families, like inmates (see the review in Wildeman, Turney, and
Schnittker, 2014), learn how to cope with incarceration. In this regard, it might be the case
that mothers who have previously experienced incarceration or families who have previously
experienced paternal incarceration have a better strategy in place for dealing with maternal
incarceration--possibly because the parent is periodically absent for other reasons--than do
families in which incarceration comes as more of a shock. This possibility, it seems to us, is
eminently reasonable, and it calls for a different public policy intervention. Specifically, this
possibility suggests that family interventions--whether through the provision of childcare
or some other direct intervention--that focus on families experiencing incarceration for the
first time might especially help the children experiencing that event. Unfortunately, because
we do not know the direct mechanisms through which these effects might operate--through
social psychological trauma, a reduction in childcare, or some other avenue--and there are
very few randomized control trials evaluating such interventions, it is difficult to know what
policy shift might be successful.
In closing, although we cannot say anything definitive regarding public policy, the
data and corresponding discussion provide some insights as to how policies might respond
to children of incarcerated mothers, especially children unlikely to experience maternal
incarceration. These analyses, which provide the first broadly representative quantitative
evidence about heterogeneity in the relation between maternal incarceration and child
wellbeing, makethreeessentialcontributions to theresearchontheconsequences ofmaternal
incarceration for children. First, we show that the effect heterogeneity strongly motivated
within qualitative research (e.g., Arditti, 2012a; Giordano, 2010; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic
et al., 2012) and across quantitative research (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2013; Wildeman
and Turney, 2014) also can be detected in population-based quantitative data by testing for
heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g., effects by the propensity for experiencing maternal
incarceration). Second, they bring together the seemingly disparate findings from previous
quantitative research, as we find substantial detrimental effects on children of mothers
very unlikely to be incarcerated, as has previous research (e.g., Hagan and Foster, 2012b;
Huebner and Gustafson, 2007), and no evidence of detrimental effects on children of
mothers most likely to be incarcerated, as has previous research (Wildeman and Turney,
2014). Finally, and most importantly, our analyses provide an important "reality check"
for those critical of the great emphasis placed on the effects of mass incarceration, relative
to the effects of criminality and other forms of disadvantage, on families and children
(Giordano, 2010; Johnston, 2006; Sampson, 2011). By documenting the point at which
the effects of maternal incarceration shift from harmful to nonexistent, we show that
the deleterious consequences of maternal incarceration for children are limited to those
unlikely to experience that event. In this regard, to construct the most accurate social ledger
of incarceration possible and to broaden understanding about the implications of mass
imprisonment for inequality (Sampson, 2011), future research must seriously consider the
heterogeneous effects of paternal incarceration on children.

Appendix A
Robustness Checks
It is possible that this striking pattern of findings results from (a) the measurement of
maternal incarceration or (b) the reliance on caregiver-reported problem behaviors. We
investigate these two possibilities in a series of robustness checks.
First, we replace the measure of maternal incarceration with a more conservative
measure of incarceration. In this conservative measure, we code incarceration affirmatively
if there is direct or indirect evidence of incarceration (and not if mothers were reported
to be "never incarcerated" at the 1-year interview and then reported to have been "ever
incarcerated" at a subsequent interview with no additional evidence of incarceration). This
alternative specification--which, because of the smaller number of mothers considered
incarcerated (N = 153), necessitates examining differences across only two strata--produces
similar findings. These results show that, for children of mothers with a low propensity
for incarceration (those in stratum 1), maternal incarceration is associated with large and
statistically significant increases in problem behaviors (b = 1.106, p < .001 for internalizing
problem behaviors; b = 0.875, p < .001 for externalizing problem behaviors; b = 0.734,
p < .01 for early juvenile delinquency), but there is no effect for children of mothers with
a high propensity for incarceration (those in stratum 2). The Level 2 coefficients show
that the between-stratum differences are statistically significant (p < .001 for internalizing
problem behaviors, p < .001 for externalizing problem behaviors, and p < .01 for early
juvenile delinquency).
In the second set of robustness checks, we estimate both teacher and child reports of
problem behaviors at the 9-year interview. Teacher-reported problem behaviors are mea-
sured by responses to the internalizing and externalizing scales of the Social Skills Rating
System (Gresham and Elliott, 2007). Child-reported internalizing and externalizing prob-
lem behaviors are measured by responses to the Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh,
1990). Because not all teachers and children were interviewed, these analyses necessitate
relying on fewer observations (N = 2,004 for teacher-reported behaviors and N = 3,008
for child-reported behaviors). The patterns of results are consistent with those estimat-
ing caregiver-reported problem behaviors. Children in stratum 1 experienced increases in
teacher-reported internalizing (b = 0.259, p < .05) and externalizing (b = 0.262, p <
.05) problem behaviors as a result of maternal incarceration. The between-stratum differ-
ences, shown by the Level 2 coefficients, are statistically significant in estimates of teacher-
reported internalizing problem behaviors (p < .01) but not in estimates of teacher-reported

reported findings suggest the data are both valid and reliable.
Sensitivity Analyses. The preceding analyses suggest that the negative consequences of
maternal incarceration are concentrated among children unlikely to experience maternal
incarceration. It is still possible that these effects result from social selection forces.
To investigate this possibility, we present results from Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity
analyses, which evaluate how sensitive the propensity score results are to unobserved
characteristics. These unobserved characteristics can be correlated with selection into
incarceration. We restrict these Rosenbaum bounds to those observations where we
find significant effects, those in stratum 1 (n = 814). These findings show that
any unobserved characteristics not included in the propensity score would have to
increase the odds of being incarcerated by 70% ( = 1.7) for internalizing problem
behaviors, by 130% ( = 2.3) for externalizing problem behaviors, and by 150%
( = 2.5) for early juvenile delinquency. To contextualize just how substantial a missing
source of unobserved heterogeneity would have to be to render our results statistically
nonsignificant, consider the results from the logistic regression model estimating the
propensity score (not presented). Those results show that exposure to domestic violence
is associated with only a 60% increase in the odds of incarceration. Similarly, maternal
substance use during pregnancy and paternal incarceration, respectively, are associated with
a 110% and 30% increase in the odds of incarceration. Thus, unobserved selection forces
would need to be substantial to render these results statistically nonsignificant.
Kristin Turney is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California--Irvine.
Her research investigates the complex, dynamic role of families in creating and exacerbating
social inequalities. Specifically, she examines the collateral consequences of incarceration
for family life, the effects of depression on individuals and children, and the causes and
consequences of childhood health inequalities. These substantive interests are accompanied
with a methodological interest in causal inference.
Christopher Wildeman is an associate professor in the Department of Policy Analysis and
Management at Cornell University and a visiting fellow at the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
His research considers (a) the consequences of mass imprisonment for inequality, with
emphasis on families, health, and children; and (b) child maltreatment and the foster care
system. He is the 2013 recipient of the Ruth Shonle Cavan Young Scholar Award from
the American Society of Criminology, and his first book (with Sara Wakefield) Children of
the Prison Boom: Mass Incarceration and the Future of American Inequality was published by
Oxford University Press in 2013.
