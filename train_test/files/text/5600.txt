Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is considered to be the most
common cause of secondary hypertension.1,2 To screen
for PA, the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is
assessed in all hypertensive patients.3 If the ARR is higher
than the normal limit, confirmatory tests are requested,
such as the captopril challenge test (CCT), saline infusion
test (SIT), furosemide plus upright test (FUT), and oral
sodium loading test (OST).
The Endocrine Society advocates the use of four con-
firmatory tests (CCT, SIT, OST, and fludrocortisone sup-
pression test) in their clinical practice guidelines for PA. A
conclusive diagnosis of PA is based on at least one positive
test result.3 The Japan Endocrine Society and the Japanese
Society of Hypertension each have guidelines for the diag-
nosis of PA, both proposing the use of the same three
confirmatory tests (CCT, SIT, and FUT). Two positive test

Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic power of the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)
stimulation test in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) and those with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA).
Design: This study was based on a retrospective database analysis.
Subjects and methods: We assessed 158 hypertensive patients with a high plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR)
including 97 with at least one positive confirmatory test result who did not undergo surgery and comprised a "possible
PA" group, 19 with negative results in all tests who were the "non-PA" group, and 41 diagnosed with APA following
surgery who were the APA group. The "confirmed PA group" included APA patients and patients from the possible PA
group showing both high ARR and hypokalemia. One case was diagnosed as a metastasis.
Results: Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of ACTH test was not
very effective in differentiating between APA patients and possible PA and non-PA patients. The optimal cut-off value
of maximal plasma aldosterone concentration for differentiating between patient in the confirmed PA group and other
patients showed moderate accuracy.
Conclusions: The ACTH test may not be useful as a screening or confirmatory test, but the test may be useful for
differentiating between patients with confirmed PA and the rest of the cohort. The positive finding of the ACTH test
may at least support a higher likelihood of lateralizing on adrenal venous sampling.

results are needed for the diagnosis according to the guide-
lines of the Japan Endocrine Society,4 while only one
positive test result is needed in the Japanese Society of
Hypertension guidelines.5 There is no consensus on
whether any of the confirmatory tests is a "gold standard"
or how many tests are needed for the diagnosis.
The adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test,
which is generally used for the diagnosis of adrenal insuf-
ficiency,6 has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of
aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) in PA patients.7
In a Japanese clinical review paper, Omura and Nishikawa
proposed that the (1­24) ACTH stimulation test should be
a secondary screening test for PA, following the obser-
vation of elevated ARR in hypertensive patients. They
reported that a cut-off value of maximal plasma aldoster-
one concentration (Max PAC, ng/dl) to cortisol ratio of
0.85 or greater was useful for the diagnosis of PA.8
Subsequently, the ACTH stimulation test has been exten-
sively used for the diagnosis of PA in Japan. The test is
routine in our hospital. Nevertheless, no validation study
has been performed thus far, and the diagnostic power of
the ACTH stimulation test remains generally unknown.
The present study aimed to examine whether theACTH
stimulation test shows the same diagnostic power as other
confirmatory tests between PA patients and non-PA hyper-
tensive patients and whether the test is useful in the diag-
nosis of APA in patients with suspected PA. To address
this hypothesis, we determined the best cut-off value to
evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the ACTH stimulation
test in patients with PA and those with APA.
Patients and methods
Patients
We retrospectively analyzed hypertensive patients with
elevated ARR (>20; PAC in ng/dl and plasma renin activ-
ity (PRA) in ng/ml/h) (n=158) who were admitted to the
Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Infectious
Diseases of Hirosaki University School of Medicine and
Hospital from 2008­2011. The study was approved and
registered as an institutional case-notes review at the
Institutional Review Board of Hirosaki University School
of Medicine and Hospital (Registration No. 2014-240).
Before the determination of ARR, mineralocorticoid
receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or angio-
tensin receptor blockers were withheld for at least two
weeks. Only calcium channel blockers and/or alpha-
adrenergic blockers were used as antihypertensive therapy.
According to the Japanese guidelines, all of the patients
underwent at least two of the three confirmatory tests for
the diagnosis of PA (CCT, SIT, or FUT) on different days.
Overall, 73 patients had at least two positive test
results and 66 had only one positive test result, while 19
had negative results for all two or three tests (non-PA
group). Of the 73 patients with two positive test results,
60 underwent adrenal venous sampling (AVS), while the
remaining 13 did not undergo AVS because they opted
against surgery. Of the 66 patients with one positive test
result, 35 desired and underwent AVS. Finally, 38 patients
were diagnosed by AVS with a unilateral adrenal lesion,
and all of these patients underwent surgical treatment.
Further, 57 patients were diagnosed with bilateral adrenal
lesions. Because of the presence of a large adrenal tumor,
four patients underwent surgery without AVS being per-
formed. Postoperatively, 41 lesions were diagnosed as
adrenocortical adenoma by light microscopic examination
(APA group), and one lesion was diagnosed as a metastasis
from renal cell carcinoma. After surgery, hypertension in
41 patients improved with normalization of ARR. Further,
97 patients (possible PA group) had at least one positive
test result but did not undergo any surgery (Figure 1).
Confirmatory testing
1. CCT: During the test, patients remained in the
supine position, and PAC and PRA were measured
at 0, 60, and 90 min after the oral administration of
captopril (50 mg). The CCT was considered to be
positive if the ARR at 60 or 90 min after captopril
administration was >20.4,5,9
2. SIT: Patients were administered an intravenous
drip infusion of 2 l of 0.9% NaCl over 4 h. After
infusion, PAC was measured. The SIT was consid-
ered to be positive if PAC>6.0 ng/dl.4,5,9

3. FUT: After maintaining a supine position for at
least 30 min, venipuncture was performed for the
measurement of basal PRA. A bolus injection of 40
mg furosemide was administered to each patient.
Patients maintained an upright posture during the
test. At 2 h after furosemide administration, PRA
was measured. The FUT was regarded as positive
if PRA<2.0 ng/ml/h.4,5,9
(1­24) ACTH stimulation test
All 158 patients underwent the (1­24) ACTH stimulation
test as a routine examination. After maintaining a supine
position for at least 30 min, a bolus injection of 250 µg
cosyntropin (synthetic (1­24) ACTH produced by Daiichi
Sankyo Co.) was administered to each patient. PAC and
plasma cortisol were measured at 0, 30, and 60 min after
the injection.
AVS
AVS was performed by expert radiologists to diagnose
whether unilateral or bilateral aldosterone-producing
lesions was present. AVS was performed with cosyntropin,
as previously reported.4,10,11 When the lateralized ratio
(adrenal venous blood aldosterone/cortisol ratio on the
high-value side)/(adrenal venous blood aldosterone/
cortisol ratio on the low-value side) was at least 2.6 after
ACTH administration, a unilateral lesion was considered
to be present on the high-value side.
Statistical analysis
All the data are presented as medians with interquartile
ranges. We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls-Test to
compare means between groups. Values of p<0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis
The diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH stimulation test was
assessed with a ROC curve and the area under the ROC
curve (AUCROC
). First, we analyzed the diagnostic accu-
racy of the ACTH test for differentiating between non-PA
patients and PA patients diagnosed by confirmatory tests
(including both APA and possible PA groups). Second, we
analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test in dif-
ferentiating between APA patients and possible PA and
non-PA patients. Because some patients in the possible PA
group were expected to have APA, we defined the "con-
firmed PA group" to include patients from the APA group
and those from the possible PA group who showed both
high ARR (>40) and hypokalemia (serum potassium<3.5
mEq/l) (Figure 1). Finally, we analyzed the diagnostic
accuracy of the ACTH test for differentiating between the
confirmed PA group and the rest of the cohort.
Results
Characteristics of the study population
The clinical characteristics of each group are summarized in
Table 1. Body weight of the APA patients differed signifi-
cantly from that of the possible PApatients.Age, height, and
body mass index did not differ among the groups. Patients
in the APA group showed significantly lower serum potas-
sium levels compared with the patients in the other groups.
Further, basal PAC levels and ARR in the APA group were
higher than those in the possible PA and non-PA groups.
Positive rates for the three confirmatory tests
The positive rates for CCT and FUT were more than 94%
and 97% in the APA group, respectively, while the positive
rate for SIT was only about 70%. In the possible PA group,
the positive rate of SIT was only 46% (Table 2).

ACTH stimulation test
The PAC value at 30 min in the non-PA group was signifi-
cantly lower than that in the other two groups. In the APA
group, the PAC values at 30 min and 60 min were signifi-
cantly higher compared with those in the other two groups.
Max PAC values, Max PAC to cortisol at the same time
ratio (Max PAC/CS), and delta PAC values in the APA
group were significantly higher than the corresponding
values in the other two groups. Further, the Max PAC val-
ues and delta PAC values in the possible PA group were
significantly higher than those in the non-PA group. The
differences in the Max PAC/CS values between the possi-
ble PA and non-PA groups were not significantly different
(Table 3). In addition, the Max PAC value in the APA
group was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that in the
possible PA and non-PA groups, and the Max PAC value in
the possible PA group was significantly higher (p<0.05)
than that in the non-PA group (Figure 2).
Diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH stimulation test
We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test for
differentiating between non-PA patients and PA patients
diagnosed by confirmatory tests (APA and possible PA
groups). The AUCROC
of Max PAC was about 0.70, and the
optimal cut-off value of Max PAC was >28.8 ng/dl. These
results corresponded to a sensitivity and specificity of 64%
and 74%, respectively (Figure 3(a)). The Youden-
index-based optimal cut-off was the same as above. We
analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the ACTH test for dif-
ferentiating between APA group and possible PA and non-
PA groups. The AUCROC
of Max PAC was about 0.73, and
the optimal cut-off value of Max PAC was >36.8 ng/dl.
These results corresponded to a sensitivity and specificity
of 61% and 75%, respectively (Figure 3(b)). The Youden-
index-based optimal cut-off was 41.7 ng/dl, with a sensi-
tivity and specificity of 56% and 82%, respectively.
Finally, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the
ACTH test for identifying the confirmed PA group. The
AUCROC
of Max PAC was about 0.77, and the optimal
cut-off value of Max PAC was >33.3 ng/dl. These results
corresponded to a sensitivity and specificity of 76% and
70%, respectively (Figure 3(c)). The Youden-index-based
optimal cut-off of Max PAC was 36.8 ng/dl, with a sensi-
tivity and specificity of 65% and 81%, respectively. The
Max PAC with 100% specificity was 54.5 ng/dl, and this
value corresponded to a sensitivity of 32%.
Discussion
The diagnosis of PA is a challenging problem in this field.
Although medical societies have advocated five tests for
diagnosis, there is no consensus as to a single, optimal
confirmatory test for PA. Nanba et al. investigated the
diagnostic significance of confirmatory tests in Japanese

hypertensive patients9 and reported that the positive rates
for CCT and FUT were more than 85% in patients with
PA; in contrast, the positive rate for SIT in these patients
was much lower (<65%). Our findings are in agreement
with their results. Therefore, both CCT and FUT may be
considered as optimal tests for diagnosing PA.
The present study was performed to test whether the
ACTH stimulation test was useful for differentiating
between PA and non-PA hypertensive patients. Some stud-
ies have reported that the ACTH stimulation test is useful
for diagnosing PA. For example, Kem et al. reported that
PAC levels after ACTH infusion in patients with PA were
significantly higher compared with those in patients with
essential hypertension.12 In a clinical review paper, Omura
and Nishikawa proposed a cut-off value of Max PAC/CS
0.85 for diagnosing PA.8 In our study, no significant dif-
ference was noted for Max PAC/CS between the possible
PA and non-PA groups, as shown in Table 3. On the other
hand, Max PAC appeared to be more useful for differential
diagnosis than Max PAC/CS. However, in the present
study, the optimal cut-off value of Max PAC (>28.8 ng/dl)
showed a low accuracy. Thus, the ACTH stimulation test
was not adequately sensitive or specific for differentiating
between PA and non-PA hypertensive patients.
The two major subtypes of PA are APA and idiopathic
hyperaldosteronism (IHA).11 After diagnosing PA, the sub-
type needs to be identified. In IHA patients, hypersecretion
of aldosterone usually occurs from both adrenal glands.
Currently, AVS is the only "gold standard" test to distin-
guish between unilateral and bilateral PA.7,13 In order to
identify PA patients, AVS is a reliable test, but it is an inva-
sive, risky, and costly procedure.7 Therefore, alternative
methods of diagnosis are required. Reincke et al. reported
that APA is generally more sensitive to ACTH compared
with IHA owing to the expression of ACTH receptors on
APA.14 Several reports, however, have demonstrated that
ACTH stimulation leads to an increase in PAC values in
some cases of IHA.11 Dexamethasone (Dex) is used in order
to eliminate the action of endogenous ACTH. Sonoyama
et al. reported that by combining it with 1 mg Dex suppres-
sion, the ACTH stimulation test was useful in the diagnosis
of APA among hypertensive patients with suspected PA,
with the optimal cut-off value of PAC being >37.9 ng/dl at
90 min after ACTH injection.7 Recently, Jiang et al. also
reported that the ACTH stimulation test with 1 mg Dex
suppression was useful for differentiating patients with
unilateral PA from patients with bilateral PA, with the opti-
mal cut-off value of PAC being >77.9 ng/dl at 120 min
after ACTH injection.15 In these two studies, 1 mg Dex

was used to eliminate the action of endogenous ACTH.
However, the authors could not clarify whether Dex sup-
pression was absolutely necessary for such differentiation.
Therefore, in our study, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy
of the ACTH stimulation test without Dex suppression for
differentiating between APA patients and other patients.
In our study, the optimal cut-off value of Max PAC for dif-
ferentiating between the APA group and other patients was
>36.8 ng/dl, showing moderate accuracy.
While computed tomography (CT) is used for diag-
nosing adrenal tumors, it often falls to diagnose these
lesions10,16 because APAs frequently measure less than 1
cm in diameter. Furthermore, it is very difficult to differ-
entiate between bilateral APA patients and bilateral IHA
patients. In the present study, it was likely that some
patients from the possible PA group may have had APAs.
If such patients can be accurately excluded from the possi-
ble PA group and included in the APA group, the diagnos-
tic power between the APA group and other patients might
show higher accuracy. We therefore defined a "confirmed
PA group" that included patients from the APA group and
patients from the possible PA group with both high ARR
and hypokalemia. With this classification, the optimal
cut-off value of Max PAC was >33.3 ng/dl and showed
moderate accuracy. Thus, the (1­24) ACTH stimulation
test without combined Dex administration showed moder-
ate diagnostic power compared with the test with Dex.
The Max PAC with 100% specificity was 54.5 ng/dl,
while this value will show a poor sensitivity of 32%
(Figure 3(c)). Therefore, the ACTH test would not be
useful for a part of routine screening tests. The positive
finding of the ACTH test may at least support a higher
likelihood of lateralizing on AVS, and it might be per-
formed in limited patients, for example, the patients who
really would not like to have AVS.
Some limitations of our study should be mentioned.
This study was a retrospective analysis, and recall bias
cannot be excluded. We also used the diagnostic criteria of
Japanese guidelines in Japanese patients. Additional stud-
ies are needed for clarifying the usefulness of the ACTH
stimulation test in other populations.
In conclusion, both CCT and FUT may be considered
as optimal tests for diagnosing PA, while the ACTH stimu-
lation test was not adequately sensitive or specific as a
screening or confirmatory test for PA. In contrast, the
ACTH stimulation test may be useful for differentiating
between patients with confirmed PA and the rest of the
cohort. The positive finding of the ACTH test may at least
support a higher likelihood of lateralizing on AVS, and it
might be performed in limited patients.
