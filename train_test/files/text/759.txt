OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of proportion of daily energy consumed in the evening with weight change
over 10 y of follow-up.
DESIGN: The data used were from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1971±75)
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS, 1982±84). The analytic cohort included 2580 men and 4567 women aged 25±
74 y at baseline (NHANES I, 1971±75). The proportion of energy consumed in the evening (after 5 pm) was estimated
from a 24 h dietary recall obtained at baseline. Weight change was de®ned as the difference between the follow-up
and baseline weights.
RESULTS: Mean Æ s.e. of percent energy from evening food intake was 46 Æ 0.29 in the analytic cohort. After
adjustment for multiple covariates, percent energy from evening food intake and weight change were unrelated in
both men and women.
CONCLUSION: Extent of evening eating was not a signi®cant predictor of 10 y weight change in the NHEFS cohort.

Introduction
Does eating at night lead to weight gain? Evidence
exploring this hypothesis in the scienti®c literature is
limited. Halberg1, in his review on chronobiology of
nutrition, reported that subjects consuming a ®xed
amount of energy for breakfast versus dinner
showed differences in the amount of weight change.
These data suggest that ef®ciency of energy utilization
shows circadian variability. Findings of Romon et al2
support this notion. Thermic effect of food (TEF) of
isocaloric meals differed according to time of day,
with TEF due to morning meal being signi®cantly
higher than TEF attributed to afternoon or night
meals2. These observations suggest that dietary pat-
terns where energy intake in the evening or night is
higher, may increase the risk of energy storage
(weight gain) by decreasing daily energy expenditure.
Another popular hypothesis is that large evening
meals promote energy storage due to the customary
practice of sedentary activities following such meals.
We recently reported the association of self-
reported body weight with extent of evening eating
in 1802 women3. In this cross-sectional study, body
mass index and proportion of daily energy consumed
in the evening were not related. We undertook the
present study to enable a prospective examination of
the relation of extent of evening eating with subse-
quent weight change over ten years of follow-up in a
large cohort of men and women.
Methods
The ®rst National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES 1) was conducted from 1971±75 by
the National Center on Health Statistics (NCHS)4. The
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)
was initiated in 1982 by NCHS and other Public
Health Service agencies, including the National Insti-
tutes of Health5. The aim of NHEFS is to relate
mortality and morbidity at follow-up to nutritional,
health, and other information collected in NHANES
I5. Respondents who were 25±74 y of age at the time
of initial survey (n  14 407) were considered eligible
for follow-up5. The augmentation phase of NHANES
I included 3059 adults, for whom 24 h dietary recall
was not obtained. We excluded these respondents
from the eligible cohort.
Analytic cohort
From the entire NHEFS cohort exclusions were made
for: 24 h recalls judged by the interviewer to be
unsatisfactory due to physical or mental limitations,
negative attitude, and incomplete interviews (205);

atypical intake due to illness on the day of recall
(272); recalls obtained from proxies (334), transcrip-
tion errors in 24 h recalls (45); and recalls of pregnant
and lactating women at baseline (125). Some respon-
dents were in more than one exclusion category.
These exclusions based on validity of baseline 24 h
recall data yielded a cohort of 10 424 individuals.
From this initial cohort, exclusions were made for
lack of follow-up weight due to known or suspected
death, or unknown status (n  3257); unreliable
reported weight (n  5); and pregnant at follow-up
(n  15). The ®nal analytic cohort thus included 2580
men and 4567 women (n  7147).
A single 24 h dietary recall was administered to
each respondent at baseline by a trained dietary
interviewer using three-dimensional food models to
enable estimation of amount of food consumed4.
Estimates of nutrient intake were obtained using US
Department of Agriculture food composition data for
the amounts of food reported consumed in each
recall6. Information on age, income, education, smok-
ing status, level of physical activity, and health status
was obtained at baseline4.
At baseline in 1971±75, body weight and height
were measured using standardized procedures in dis-
posable uniforms and footwear in examination trai-
lers4. At follow-up in 1982±84, weight was measured
in indoor clothing, without shoes, using a portable
scale in subject's home5, but height was not measured.
Because sex, age, body size, and season-adjusted
estimated weights of indoor clothing are not available
for this cohort, we did not adjust the follow-up weight
for weight of indoor clothing. Further, our purpose
was to examine the association of evening eating with
weight change from baseline and not the extent of
absolute weight change over the period of follow-up.
Such analyses would be unchanged by subtraction of a
constant estimated weight of indoor clothing from the
follow-up weight.
Extent of evening eating at baseline
As part of the baseline 24 h dietary recall, subjects
were asked to give time of day for each eating
occasion. Eating occasions reported before or until
10:59 am were classi®ed as occurring in the morning
period; eating occasions reported from 11:00 am±
4:59 pm were in the afternoon period; eating occa-
sions from 5:00 pm±7:59 pm were in the evening
period; and those reported at or after 8:00 pm were
in the night period.
Statistical methods
Weight change was de®ned as the difference between
weight measured at follow-up and baseline. Propor-
tion of daily energy intake from each of the de®ned
time periods (morning, afternoon, evening, and night)
was calculated for each respondent. Descriptive sta-
tistics for baseline nutrient intake, baseline body mass
index (BMI), and weight change were obtained by
percent energy from evening and night food intake.
The association of percent energy from evening and
night combined (all foods consumed after 5 pm), and
night (after 8 pm) food intake at baseline and weight
change was examined using sex-speci®c regression
analyses. All regression analyses were run with and
without adjustment for variables known to affect body
weight. The potential confounders included race
(white, non-white), education ( ` 12 y, 12 y, b 12 y),
smoking status (never, former and current smoker),
age at baseline (continuous), length of follow-up
(continuous), level of self-reported recreational phy-
sical activity at baseline and at follow-up (a lot,
moderate, and little), energy intake (continuous),
baseline BMI (continuous), alcohol intake (none,
low and high), special diet status (yes and no), and
parity (0, ! 1) (women only). Additionally, because
changes in body weight may be affected by the
presence of certain medical conditions, a trend vari-
able based on physician-con®rmed diagnosis of heart
condition, diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disease,
and hospitalization since 1970 for cirrhosis, colitis,
chronic bronchitis or cancer was created, using the
criteria of Williamson et al7. The morbidity variable
ranged from 0±3, where 0  no, 1  1 positive
response, 2  2 positive responses, and 3  3 or
more positive responses.
Statistical software suitable for analyses of complex
survey data were used to estimate standard errors for
means (SESUDAAN)8 and linear regression coef®-
cients (SURREGR)9.
Results
The mean age of men and women in the analytic
cohort was 44.6 Æ 0.3 and 45.9 Æ 0.3 y, respectively,
at baseline. The mean follow-up time was
10.6 Æ 0.1 y. Men reported consuming 33 Æ 0.5% of
total daily energy in the evening period with an
additional 13 Æ 0.4% in the night period for a total
of approximately 46% reported after 5 pm (Table 1).
Comparable levels were reported by women. Men and
women in the third tertile of percent energy consumed
after 5 pm reported an average of 63% and 65% of
total energy from foods consumed after 5 pm, respec-
tively (Table 1).
Energy and macronutrient intake in relation with the
extent of after 5 pm eating
With increasing percent of energy consumed after
5 pm, mean dietary energy and alcohol intake
increased (P 0.05), and mean percent energy from
carbohydrate declined (Table 2). No association of

Association of the extent of after 5 pm eating with other
factors related to weight change
The mean weight change was 2.1 Æ 0.2 and
2.5 Æ 0.2 kg in men and women, respectively (Table
3). Percent energy consumed after 5 pm decreased
with advancing age (Table 3), but increased with the
level of education (Table 4). Whites reported a higher
level of after 5 pm eating that did non-whites. Current
smokers had higher level of after 5 pm eating relative
to never-smokers. Women with a high level of base-
line BMI ( b 27.2) reported a lower percent energy
after 5pm relative to those with BMI of 27.2. Men
with no or low morbidity had higher food intake after
5 pm relative to those with greater morbidity. Percent
energy consumed after 5 pm varied little by the level
of self-reported recreational physical activity at base-
line or follow-up in both men and women.

variate-adjusted regression models. In women, a posi-
tive association of extent of after 5 pm eating with
weight change was noted in unadjusted models, but
not after adjustment for age or multiple covariates.
Association of night eating (after 8 pm) with weight
change was also not signi®cant in men or women
(data not shown).
The association of after 5 pm eating with weight
change was also examined after strati®cation for
weight loss or weight gain status. No association
(P b 0.05) was noted in men and women who lost or
gained weight over the period of follow-up (data not
shown).
To determine whether potential confounders such
as baseline BMI, age, cigarette smoking, physical
activity, morbidity, and special diet status at baseline
modify the association of extent of after 5 pm eating
with weight change, stratum-speci®c regression ana-
lyses were performed within each strata of each of
these variables. Percent energy from evening food
intake and weight change were positively associated
in multiple-covariate-adjusted regression models in
men never-smokers (n  754, beta for percent energy
intake after 5 pm  0.0370, P  0.02), and those
reporting the highest level of recreational exercise at
follow-up (n  494, beta for percent energy intake
after 5 pm  0.0437, P  0.0027). In women, the posi-
tive association of extent of after 5 pm eating with
weight change was signi®cant in those reporting little
or no recreational physical exercise at baseline
(n  2266, beta for percent energy intake after
5 pm  0.0334, P  0.0141); highest level of recrea-
tional physical activity at follow-up (n  593, beta
for percent energy intake after 5 pm  0.0579,
P  0.0071); and morbidity score of 1 (n  1555,
beta for percent energy intake after 5 pm  0.0289,
P  0.0494). (Data for strati®ed analyses not shown).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ®rst study to pros-
pectively examine the relation of time of energy
consumption with long-term weight change. In unstra-
ti®ed analyses, the association of evening eating and
weight change was not signi®cant in men or women.
In accordance with results of our previous study3,
baseline BMI and percent energy consumed after 5 pm
were also not related in multiple-covariate-adjusted
regression models.
The biologic plausibility of the hypothesis exam-
ined in this study is dependent on time of day
differences in TEF. The limited evidence on circadian
variability of TEF presents a mixed picture. For
example, Romon et al2 reported TEF after a night
meal to be lowest relative to iso-energetic meals
consumed in the morning or afternoon. Zwiauer et
al10, however, noted no differences in TEF after a
morning versus an afternoon meal. More work, using
reproducible methods to account for large intraindivi-
dual variability in TEF measurements11, is needed in
this area.
Another hypothesis for increased risk of energy
storage is based on differences in level of voluntary
energy expenditure after consumption of meals at
different times of the day. It is argued that a large
meal in the middle of the day (usually followed by
several hours of physical activities) will not lead to
energy storage, whereas due to the usual practice of
sedentary activities following the evening meal, large
evening meals increase the risk of energy storage.
These statements suggest a different mechanism,
dependent on the interaction of exercise and TEF.
However, the available evidence on the interaction of
exercise and TEF is equivocal12,13. Different results,
dependent on pre versus post meal exercise, adiposity,
level of ®tness, duration of exercise, and energy
content of the meal, have been reported12. In the
present study, no consistent pattern of association
was observed in men and women strati®ed by level
of baseline or follow-up physical activity. The
observed associations may simply be due to chance
because of the number of multiple comparisons made.
We also noted a positive association of after 5 pm
eating with weight change in male never-smokers
only, which suggests an interaction of smoking with
TEF. Although metabolic effects of smoking are
known to differ by gender, Perkins14 concluded that
smoking had either little effect on TEF or reduced the
TEF.
The evidence of the effect of adiposity on thermo-
genic effect of food is equivocal. Some indicate that
TEF is blunted in obese individuals15,16, others have
reported no differences in TEF of obese versus non-
obese individuals17,18. We examined the association of
extent of evening eating with weight change within
different strata of baseline BMI. No association was
evident in any strata in men or women, suggesting
lack of effect of adiposity on the relation of evening
eating and weight change.
The estimated mean of 46% of energy intake after
5 pm for this cohort (24 h dietary recall in 1971±1975)
is similar to the estimate we reported for women in the
1985±86 CSFII (four non-consecutive days of dietary
data)3. Few other published estimates are available,
but generally our results are consistent with these
reports19.
The source of baseline dietary data for the NHEFS
cohort is a 24 h dietary recall. Measurement error is
known to be associated with all dietary assessment
methods including recalls20. Under reporting and
misreporting of food intake has been recognized as a
problem in dietary survey20,21. A differential in the
extent of under reporting by the level of adiposity has
also been reported in some studies.21 To improve
quality of dietary intake data in future surveys, use
of techniques such as double labeled water or other
biomarkers to validate estimates of energy intake in a
subsample should be considered. Also, replicate diet-

ary measurements can be used to derive variance
ratios for dietary variables. However, biomarkers for
validating dietary intake or estimates of intra- and
interindividual variability of the exposure variable
(time of day energy intake) for the NHEFS cohort
are not available to allow correction of our estimates
of association.
Another possible reason for attenuation of the true
association of time of eating with weight change may
be a differential ability or willingness to recall foods
consumed at different times of day. To our knowl-
edge, no evidence is available to support or contradict
this hypothesis. Yet, it is possible that individuals may
not remember or choose to recall foods consumed late
at night due to undesirability of this eating behavior,
thereby leading to an underestimate of the extent of
after 5 pm eating. Furthermore, if there is a body
weight related differential in estimates of extent of
after 5 pm eating, it may also diminish the true
association.
The assumption of persistence of dietary patterns
over the period of follow-up is inherent in epidemio-
logic studies that do not include repeated ascertain-
ment of changes in exposure. Repeated measures of
dietary intake over the follow-up period are not
available for the NHEFS cohort. To test the validity
of this assumption, it is useful to examine whether
time of day food consumption patterns persist in
adults. A comparison of estimates of after 5 pm
eating for the NHEFS cohort (46% in 1971±1974)
with estimates from CSFII (46%) in 1985±86), does
not support the notion of dramatic changes in time of
day food consumption patterns of Americans. How-
ever, because the extent of after 5 pm eating declined
with age in this cohort (Table 3), it is reasonable to
assume that as the cohort ages, time of day food
consumption patterns will change with retirement.
The effect of this possible change in exposure over
follow-up would be to further attenuate the true
association.
Conclusions
The extent of evening eating and subsequent weight
changes were unrelated in the NHEFS cohort. The
results of this study point to a need for long-term
feeding trials with manipulation of time-of-day dis-
tribution of iso-energetic intake in subjects serving as
their own controls. Work on the relation of body
weight with accuracy of dietary reporting by time of
day as well as the extent of intra- and inter-individual
variability in estimates of extent of eating by time of
day is needed. Further exploration of time of day
differences in TEF, controlling for factors that con-
tribute to large variability in measurement of TEF, is
also needed.
